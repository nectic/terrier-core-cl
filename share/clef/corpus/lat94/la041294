AL MARTINEZ: VOICES FROM THE SHADOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She sits hunched forward most of the time and stares at the floor, speaking in 
a monotone from a far corner of her mind, muted by the limitations life has 
imposed on her. 
</P>
<P>
 Only when she discusses her dream does she look up and smile. She wants to 
become a restaurant hostess. It's a dream of modest proportions, one that won't 
make a ripple in the face of the economy, but for her it's an awesome ambition. 
</P>
<P>
 I sing today of LaDonna Galbreath, who edges her way hesitantly back into the 
world from a place of shadows and devils, and who pursues her dream like a 
child crawling toward a toy. 
</P>
<P>
 Both schizophrenic and diabetic, she's a hulking woman of 32 with the mental 
capacity of a 12-year-old, three times damned by her own birth to an existence 
on the outer edges of society. 
</P>
<P>
 I met her in a small room at Goodwill Industries, where a program has been 
instituted to help those like LaDonna who tote heavy loads of both physical and 
mental incapacities. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the only such program in California and one of very few in the nation 
that undertakes to assist those struggling against multiple hardships; the slow 
dancers in a world of fast music. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty people at a time are led through sessions designed to prepare them to 
deal with their own problems and to learn to exist in a society that won't slow 
down for them. LaDonna is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 She's learning to support herself and to deal, through counseling and 
medication, with the demons that schizophrenia creates. As she told me one 
quiet spring afternoon, "I don't hear voices anymore that tell me to kill." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We all hear voices. They come from sunlit places and are the subconscious 
whispers of motivation that tell us to love and care and achieve. They damp our 
rages and control our excesses. 
</P>
<P>
 LaDonna's voices come from the shadows of hallucination. She can't remember 
when they began, but she's sure it had something to do with an acid trip she 
took when she was 14 that plunged her into a state of distortion from which she 
has never fully emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 The voices were the voices of the devil in all his multiple levels of evil. 
They told LaDonna she was bad. They told her to kill her son. 
</P>
<P>
 Abandoned by her father and orphaned by her mother, she was raised by a 
grandmother who did her best to give her charge a decent life. But "slow" by 
her own definition, LaDonna couldn't handle the demands of school and dropped 
out in the 10th grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Vulnerable and desperate for someone to care about her, she turned to men for 
comfort and became pregnant shortly thereafter. They beat her and took what 
subsistence money she got from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 LaDonna attempted in her own way to shake the voices that by now roared 
through her mind like cyclonic winds. She thought her oldest son the devil and 
gave him to an aunt in an effort to still the roar. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't work. The voices persisted. She struggled with their commands to 
smother her youngest child; sometimes she could feel the presence of evil in 
her darkened bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just shut the voices out," she said the other day. "I just listened and 
went on about my business. I wasn't going to kill my boy. He was just a baby 
and I loved him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 State-sponsored psychiatric treatment got LaDonna started on medication that 
began dealing with her hallucinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Goodwill Industries' Special Projects Program had come into being. 
An evaluation by the California Department of Rehabilitation called it "the 
finest program of its kind we have ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 LaDonna Galbreath entered the program almost a year ago, withdrawn and 
confused. A psychologist, a therapist and counselors began working with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, she began to improve. The voices became less frequent and finally 
disappeared. The commands to kill receded into the shadows and have never been 
heard again. 
</P>
<P>
 Simultaneously, LaDonna began taking classes as part of the program. She's 
learning custodial work and good parenting, and earns $4.60 an hour working for 
Goodwill. A "care provider" lives with her and tends her son while LaDonna 
works, attends classes and undergoes therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Life is different for her now, and the future clear enough to allow for the 
entrance of modest ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sure that anyone so burdened will ever achieve the goals they set for 
themselves, but at least one person in a city of millions is taking a few 
tentative steps away from her own terrible night of the soul. 
</P>
<P>
 That the wonder of a simple dream will cause LaDonna Galbreath to look up and 
smile reminds us that the world exists for the slow dancers too. Welcome them 
into it.

FINALLY, A CRIME BILL THAT'S NOT A CRIME; HOUSE PUTS FINISHING TOUCHES ON AN 
APPROACH THAT IS GENERALLY SUPERIOR TO THE SENATE'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to crime, Congress is usually all promise and no delivery. A 
decade of debate has produced little more than hot rhetoric, despite massive 
entreaties from fed-up and fearful Americans. But this year could prove 
different. Just about everyone -- the President and most Republicans and 
Democrats in the Senate and House -- agrees on the core of a remarkably good 
anti-crime package. 
</P>
<P>
 The bills would put 100,000 new cops on the streets, toughen sentences, build 
prisons, provide drug treatment and open boot camps for young offenders. The 
House and Senate also agree on how to finance the $23-billion price tag over 
five years: with alleged savings from planned reductions in the federal 
payroll. Money is usually the biggest hurdle in Washington, so this approach is 
touted as one that neither requires new taxes nor swells the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The broad areas of agreement bode well in a city where bipartisan consensus is 
rare. But there is still room for improvement on the equally broad areas of 
bitter disagreement over punishment versus prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 The House leans toward the impressive anti-crime approach of Rep. Charles E. 
Schumer (D-N.Y.), which toughens punishment without sacrificing rehabilitation. 
A strong prevention program would keep schools open at night and on weekends, 
expand job training, fund community programs and increase drug treatment in 
prisons and elsewhere. Strong civil-rights provisions, crafted by Rep. Don 
Edwards (D-San Jose), would protect Death Row appeals and challenge racial bias 
in death-penalty sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate version, which passed in November, contains many good elements, 
including California Sen. Dianne Feinstein's ban on assault weapons. But it 
also includes a "three strikes and you're out" provision that could apply too 
broadly to nonviolent criminals. And it would now extend the death penalty to 
64 federal crimes -- an ill-conceived move. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the House approach fine-tunes the Senate's work by more 
appropriately reserving the harshest punishment for violent repeat offenders. 
It would also give states greater discretion over use of new federal prison 
money. California, for example, could use funds to cover the incarceration of 
undocumented immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes but cannot be 
deported. This is a big-ticket item in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Adminstration is pushing hard for passage of a crime bill. 
Washington just might produce its best effort in years.

HEADS SHOULD ROLL OVER THIS; GOV. WILSON MUST PERSONALLY PROBE STATE EDUCATION 
DEPARTMENT FOR TEST SCANDAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California spent $15 million a year ago for a much-needed new system of tests 
designed to better measure what public-school students were actually learning 
and how well equipped they were to meet the future. Now it appears that a San 
Jose principal's description of the exercise as a "waste of money" was apt: The 
scoring was marked by outrageous errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature should demand an explanation from the 
state Education Department, and the department should re-evaluate the company 
that administered the tests and those state officials who supervised the 
company. If people have to be removed, so be it. The errors must not be 
repeated. 
</P>
<P>
 One million pupils in the fourth, eighth and 10th grades took the new 
California Learning Assessment System (CLAS) tests for reading, writing and 
mathematics. Education Department officials argued there was not enough time or 
money to score all the tests, so only about half were graded. But a computer 
analysis by The Times showed numerous instances where the state failed to meet 
its own guidelines of scoring at least 25% of the exams taken at every school. 
Thus the results of the tests were far less accurate than promised. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, for example, there were six schools where less than 25% of 
the tests were scored. In a San Bernardino County middle school, only 1% of the 
math tests were scored. 
</P>
<P>
 At Roosevelt Elementary in Indio, 169 students took the tests, but only four 
papers were graded. The results reported that everyone scored at the lowest 
possible level in mathematics. The principal was right to be furious. Her 
school has been maligned, with blame reflecting onto her and her teachers. 
Worse, she cannot know if the state "grade" given to the school is largely 
correct, half right, mostly wrong or totally bogus. How can she know what, if 
anything, needs fixing? 
</P>
<P>
 These were not harmless errors. The results prompted parents to ask private 
schools about getting their children admitted; there were renewed calls to 
break up the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The CLAS methods and goals remain promising. Multiple-choice exams have been 
replaced by tests requiring students to write some answers and explain how they 
solved a problem. Students are not graded against one another but against a 
fixed standard. The state hopes eventually to test all pupils, if the 
Legislature funds the exams each year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rush to put the testing in place needlessly provided ammunition to the 
critics of the new system. In such a sensitive, vital area as children's 
education, mistakes like this one cost too dearly. Fix the errors before giving 
the tests again. The promised apologies will not make up for the harm that has 
been done.

BUT WILL THE SERBS GET THE MESSAGE?; BOMBING OF POSITIONS NEAR GORAZDE HARDENS 
NATO'S LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been 10 months since the U.N. Security Council authorized the United 
Nations to employ "all necessary means, including the use of force," to defend 
designated "safe areas" in Bosnia against Serbian attacks. On Sunday and again 
on Monday, after hundreds of civilians had already been killed and wounded in 
the Serbian siege of one of those safe areas, force was finally used in the 
form of very limited air strikes by NATO -- meaning American -- planes. 
</P>
<P>
 As Serbian gunners kept up their indiscriminate shelling of the Muslim 
population in Gorazde, the U.N. commander asked for and quickly got approval 
for tactical air attacks. Their objective was to compel the Serbs to respect 
the protected status of Gorazde and to impel them to return to negotiations for 
a political settlement to the Bosnian war. But, by the end of the second day of 
direct NATO involvement in that war, it remained far from clear whether either 
of these goals would soon be met. 
</P>
<P>
 YELTSIN'S HOWL: Russia has protested loudly about the U.S. air raids, though 
whether more from hurt feelings because it wasn't consulted in advance or out 
of historic affinity with the Serbs it's hard to say. Probably a bit of both. 
President Boris Yeltsin's government has lately used every possible occasion to 
reassert Russia's claim to be a great power to whom attention must be paid, and 
has been taking a much more nationalistic foreign-policy line generally ever 
since its far-right opponents did so well in last December's legislative 
elections. The change in Moscow's position on Bosnia became especially evident 
less than two weeks ago. It was then that Russia, despite its earlier support 
for using force in Bosnia, prevented the Security Council from adopting a weak 
statement condemning Serbian attacks on Gorazde. Had Russia reaffirmed its 
support for putting military force behind the expressed U.N. will, the siege of 
Gorazde might have been ended and a lot of suffering might have been prevented. 
</P>
<P>
 CLINTON'S CALL: President Clinton of course did the right thing in authorizing 
the use of U.S. air power against Serb positions. As the central power in NATO 
and as the key decision-maker in the Security Council, this country had only 
one course if it hoped to preserve the credibility of both organizations: to 
act in the face of continued flagrant aggression. But it's clear at the same 
time that Washington, aware of the lack of support for deep U.S. involvement in 
Bosnia among the public, in Congress and in the Pentagon, has no intention of 
extending itself too deeply. What it desperately wants is a negotiated end to 
this brutal conflict, even if that means letting the Serbs keep most of their 
territorial spoils. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day or two should tell if the Serbs have been sufficiently sobered by 
the American air strikes to rethink their strategy. NATO Secretary General 
Manfred Woerner warns that any effort by the Serbs to retaliate against U.N. 
peacekeepers would see NATO react "very forcefully." That's as it should be. 
But at the same time it would be helpful to know just whose armed forces 
Woerner is threatening to react with. Is the show in the skies over Bosnia 
supposed to be exclusively American, or will the alliance in fact start to 
behave like an alliance?

SANTA MONICA FREEWAY REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "Santa Monica Freeway to Reopen on Tuesday," April 6: 
</P>
<P>
 A skeptic might believe the "fix" was in the day C.C. Myers Inc. signed on for 
the Santa Monica Freeway repair. That same skeptic might speculate that Myers 
is well-schooled and very bright and knew how long this job could take, thus 
penciling in a "little extra" for himself -- with the help of course from state 
officials (who would never accept one dime from Myers for their champagne 
chests). 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind the cost of the repair was double what Myers bid, officials praise 
his early completion. An ungrateful citizen might suggest that his "bonus" be 
kept because his bid was only 100% off. Or maybe the money should go toward 
quake relief! But no, Myers needs a bigger airplane! (Don't we all?) 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the story: First Myers is canonized by the governor, then he flies 
away with his construction fee plus a $14.5-million bonus, then the citizens 
pay $30 million for a job that was supposed to cost $15 million. Great story, 
eh?

<P>
 * In response to "Wilson Gets Mileage Out of Rebuilt Freeway," news analysis, 
April 7: 
</P>
<P>
 It is appalling that Clinton Administration officials are angry that Gov. Pete 
Wilson has been complaining for more than a year that the federal government is 
doing too little to assist California. They cite the fact that it was President 
Clinton who was responsible for speeding up the reconstruction project on the 
earthquake-damaged Santa Monica Freeway and without any cost to California 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears that we must experience a natural disaster in order to obtain 
assistance from our President. Clinton provided the people in California with 
promises of help during his election campaign. This is the place where the Cold 
War with the former Soviet Union was terminated, and this is also the place 
which suffered the most due to loss of jobs and declining real estate values. 
</P>
<P>
 California did its job during the Cold War. Now it is time for President 
Clinton to fulfill his promises to provide business investment incentives and 
other programs to allow us to join the rest of the nation in recovery.

DARRYL STRAWBERRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to Keven Bellows' column "Here's Why Strawberry's Problem Is a 
Disease, Tom," Commentary, April 7: 
</P>
<P>
 I found her disagreement with Tommy Lasorda's statement to be over a minor 
semantic point that has no bearing on Lasorda's conclusions or actions. As a 
person also suffering from the disease of alcoholism, I believe its 
classification as a disease is important in deciding a course of action for the 
afflicted (a disease gets medical treatment but I'm not sure how to correct a 
moral weakness).However, having this disease does not in any way lessen 
Strawberry's responsibility for his actions nor should it mitigate the 
consequences. He can't help what he is, but he sure as hell can control what he 
does. Being an alcoholic no more justifies his irresponsibility than it would a 
death caused by a drunk driver. 
</P>
<P>
 I would rephrase Lasorda's quote to "How anyone could be dumb enough to take 
drugs, I cannot comprehend. I mean, it's crazy . . . I don't give a damn 
whether it's a disease." Bellows is right, sobriety is a challenge. I wish 
Strawberry the best of luck and God's help, but I don't think Lasorda and the 
Dodgers have to put up with it. 
</P>

<P>
 * Despite Bellows' protestations, Lasorda's comments on Strawberry's drug 
abuse were 100% correct. It is a weakness, not a disease. Sure, it's an 
addiction, but so is sugar, caffeine and tobacco. True, some may cause a 
stronger craving than others, but they can be overcome. Some, like alcoholism, 
may even be inherited.  
</P>
<P>
 While we realize that many have an economic interest in promoting the 
"disease-victim" theory, this country cannot continue to excuse destructive 
behavior.

<P>
 * Re "Bias Blights Life Outside Appalachia," March 29: 
</P>
<P>
 What's all the fuss about "hillbilly" bias? I am proud to be a full-fledged 
West Virginia hillbilly whose dad was raised up "Catfish Holler," whose 
95-year-old grandmother just got running water, and whose grandfather was once 
a coal miner. 
</P>
<P>
 Did I experience discrimination when I left the Appalachians to work a summer 
job in Columbus, Ohio, or when I graduated from college and journeyed to Los 
Angeles? No. But I also came from a family that valued a good education and 
high achievement.

WRIGHT'S 'BLACK BOY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Regarding the Ventura County controversy over a school reading assignment, 
April 4: 
</P>
<P>
 I read Richard Wright's "Black Boy" as an adolescent nearly half a century 
ago. I do not believe it corrupted me, but, to the contrary, opened my white, 
middle-class eyes to what was going on around me and, I hope, contributed to 
making me a more empathetic and compassionate human being. 
</P>
<P>
 Are the objecting parents afraid their children will be shaken from the 
complacency and comfort of a tight, little closed mind? I suggest the parents 
read the book for themselves, beginning to end. It may broaden their own 
horizons. If they are not moved, if they are not touched by it, then indeed 
they have hearts of cold white granite.

COLUMN LEFT/ ALEXANDER COCKBURN: STAGE IS SET FOR EXPANDED INTERVENTION; THE 
BOMBING OVER GORAZDE COULD BE A BUMP ON THE ROAD TO PEACE, BUT MORE LIKELY 
SIGNALS A WIDER WAR AGAINST THE SERBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDER COCKBURN, Alexander Cockburn writes for the Nation and other 
publications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The weekend NATO bombing of Serbian forces around the eastern Bosnian town of 
Gorazde comes as the consummation of a protracted, furious campaign here for 
vigorous military intervention on behalf of the Bosnian Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 After teetering on the edge of the knife, amid advice by U.S. military 
officials not to mount air strikes against Serbs around Gorazde, the Clinton 
Administration reversed its posture of only last week and committed F-16Cs in 
two strikes. As we shall see, this was the finale of a set-up by the Bosnian 
Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual raids won't make any difference in the local tactical situation. So 
the real intent is to signal what Henry Kissinger used to call "U.S. resolve." 
</P>
<P>
 But resolve for what? 
</P>
<P>
 With the secession -- amid Western encouragement -- of Slovenia and Croatia 
from the old Yugoslav federation, and the prompt recognition by the West of the 
breakaway in April, 1992, of the Muslim-dominated republic of Bosnia, bloodshed 
was assured. The Serbs in the Krajina enclave in Croatia and in the fragile 
ethnic and religious mix in Bosnia felt that their position had become 
impossibly precarious. The war, with all its horrors, began. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal pushed by the United States this spring fostered a closer 
relationship between the Croatians and the Bosnian Muslims. The Serbs in their 
enclave in Croatian Krajina would acknowledge Croat suzerainty, but receive 
guarantees of some form of autonomy. As envisaged in all the peace plans, the 
Serbs in Bosnia would hold about 50% of Bosnia. Serbian concerns would thus be 
allayed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Serbs could be reading this very differently. U.S.-fostered ties 
between Croatia and the Bosnian Muslims mean that arms now flow unimpeded 
through Croatia to the increasingly formidable Muslim forces, which are 
commencing onslaughts against the Serbs.  
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Croatia could start pressing down on the Serbs in Krajina, 
evoking once again memories of the terrible massacres of World War II.  
</P>
<P>
 The Serb attack on Gorazde reflects their fear that the diplomatic and 
military balance of forces has turned against them and that a 
U.S.-Croatian-Muslim coalition will engineer all the perils Serbs feared back 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 They have good reasons to sense a double-cross. The Western press have been 
overwhelmingly blind to Serb concerns and partial -- often grossly so so -- to 
the Bosnian Muslims as the latter maneuvered toward U.S. military intervention 
on their side, which is now taking place.  
</P>
<P>
 Take the Feb. 5 shelling of the marketplace in Sarajevo that killed more than 
60 people and decisively strengthened the hand of those urging intervention.  
</P>
<P>
 BBC correspondent John Simpson, writing in the British weekly the Spectator 
for April 2, describes how Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic failed to 
appear at a Feb. 9 cease-fire meeting among all parties brokered by the U.N. 
commander, Lt. Gen. Michael Rose. It seemed that once again, as so often 
before, Izetbegovic was trying to torpedo any cease-fire or settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose, according to Simpson (himself no friend of the Serbs and writing in a 
fanatically pro-interventionist periodical) sprang into his armored car, made 
haste to Izetbegovic's quarters and closeted himself with the Muslim president, 
who proceeded to the peace meeting shortly thereafter.  
</P>
<P>
 Simpson writes that according to one "insider" (one would surmise, Sir Michael 
himself) the British general "threatened to question publicly whether the Serbs 
really had been responsible for the marketplace explosion." Rose officially 
denies the story and the Muslims are saying nothing. Experienced correspondent 
Misha Glenny has also hinted at Muslim culpability. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbs' attack on Gorazde was preceded last week by Muslim attacks on Serbs 
in central Bosnia. The Serbs said they would retaliate unless the Muslims 
guaranteed a cease-fire. The Muslims offered only a 24-hour truce. The Serb 
attacks on Gorazde followed, with -- according to the London Financial Times of 
last Friday -- U.N. officials on the spot admonished by their bosses to 
downplay the Muslim provocation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Muslims and their U.S. public-relations firm have been successful 
in manipulating opinion here. The stage is now set for larger intervention 
against the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 A pessimist or a cynic could see across the rubble of President Clinton's 
domestic policies and the Whitewater mess the outline of a more bellicose 
foreign stance. Today, bombs over Gorazde; tomorrow, bombs over North Korea. 
The Clinton Administration may feel that Serbia's sponsor, Russia, is toothless 
as Boris Yeltsin slumbers through his twilight. They should beware. As veterans 
of the Korean War will recall, China is a different matter.

COLUMN RIGHT/ MICKEY EDWARDS: DON'T CONFUSE CONSTITUTION, CONSTITUENTS; GEORGE 
MITCHELL'S CONSIDERABLE SKILLS AS A POLITICIAN WOULD ILL SERVE THE NATION ON 
THE BENCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICKEY EDWARDS, Mickey Edwards, a former congressman (R-Okla.), is teaching 
at the John F. Kennedy School of Government and writing a column. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While there are other names on the list, the betting is on Sen. George 
Mitchell to emerge as President Clinton's choice to succeed Harry Blackmun on 
the Supreme Court. For precisely the reasons the President might prefer 
Mitchell, I hope he chooses somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides being a sure bet for easy confirmation, Mitchell would bring to the 
court a dimension that has been missing and that the President believes is 
beneficial. Mitchell is a politician, and a good one. Which is why he should be 
dropped from the list, along with Bruce Babbitt. 
</P>
<P>
 A politician would bring to the court two attributes that are missing in most 
other people. Men and women who have run for public office are uniquely 
sensitive to the desires of the people. While they are often criticized for 
testing the political breezes, that is precisely what they are supposed to do: 
represent the people who elected them. And politicians -- at least the good 
ones -- are skilled at building consensus, forging compromise. That, too, draws 
criticism. But in the legislative arena, where one advances ideas 
incrementally, and problems must be dealt with, the ability to build a 
consensus behind a middle ground is an indispensable tool. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, politicians are, temperamentally, activists. They are doers. They 
want to shape society, create change, push the pendulum. Those are precisely 
the kinds of attributes we ought to look for in candidates for the presidency 
and for Congress. Those are legislative attributes. A judge has a different 
task and requires a different psychology. The ideal judge is at home not in the 
world of on-the-run, make-it-happen decision-making, but in contemplation, in 
careful deliberation. These qualities are not highly valued by the electorate 
but they are essential on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to look at the polarization of the current court and become enamored 
of the idea of finding a mystical healer who can bridge the gap between the 
"liberals," whose numbers will be diminished by Blackmun's retirement, and 
conservatives like Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. It's tempting, too, to 
think of a justice who will be in tune with the public will. 
</P>
<P>
 That, however, is not the court's role. The instincts of a politician are 
precisely the opposite of those required of a Supreme Court Justice, whose job 
is to analyze controversy not in the light of the public mood, but by the light 
of the Constitution. It is adherence to the Constitution that protects our 
rights as citizens, and those rights are not to be subject to the whim of the 
majority, nor to the compromises necessary to forge judicial harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 When Robert Bork was nominated to serve on the Supreme Court, his selection 
was hailed by most conservatives, who generally shared his vision of what 
society ought to be, and opposed by most liberals, who were appalled by the 
specter of a Borkean society. As a conservative, I shared many of Bork's 
concerns, but I had no enthusiasm for his nomination. Bork expressed his 
distaste for judicial activism by criticizing the court's tendency to create 
rights not found in the Constitution. Bork was looking in the wrong place: Our 
rights are not found in the Constitution. The Constitution defines not those 
rights we keep, but the rights and powers we give up to the government. All 
other rights -- religious, economic, personal -- are ours, and they are ours by 
birth, not by the sufferance of government. 
</P>
<P>
 Bork's confusion emphasizes the need to protect ourselves against a court that 
will aim to please the majority rather than to protect the minority. We don't 
need judges who will try to understand the shifting sands of public opinion; 
that's the job of legislators. We don't need judges who will try to find 
compromise; we need judges who will protect our rights with the fervor shown by 
the Founding Fathers. We don't need judges whose personalities are geared to 
activism. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that there have been justices who have moved from elected office to 
the court, and some have been effective there. In some cases, the nature of the 
court changed the nature of the man. William Howard Taft served ably both in 
elective office and on the bench. Hugo Black, once an Alabama racist, underwent 
a metamorphosis when he changed his white robes for the black robes of the 
court. Earl Warren, on the other hand, used to using elective office as a means 
to reshape the world, carried that political mind-set to the Supreme Court with 
him and redesigned the court's role, turning it into a super-legislature, 
unelected and unaccountable. If a politician must be chosen, George Mitchell is 
probably the best of the lot. But we would be better served to look elsewhere, 
to keep politics and the court separate, to let legislators legislate and let 
judges deliberate.

INSIST ON REPLACING THE FUEL RODS IN JULY; NORTH KOREA: A REFUSAL BY KIM WOULD 
BE A CLEAR SIGNAL OF THE NEED FOR SANCTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER D. ZIMMERMAN, Peter D. Zimmerman, a nuclear physicist, is the visiting 
senior fellow in arms control and verification at the Center for Strategic and 
International Studies in Washington.

<TEXT>
<P>
 It is difficult for the North Koreans even to pretend that they have not 
completed at least one nuclear weapon. Defense Secretary William Perry recently 
indicated as much on national television and, shortly after taking office, 
Central Intelligence Director R. James Woolsey Jr. stated that the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea probably had separated enough plutonium for at least 
one first-generation "device." 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomacy to dissuade the North from going nuclear lost its utility sometime 
in 1991 or 1992, to judge by the evidence gathered during the incomplete 
international inspections. Sometime during the administration of President 
Bush, North Korea crossed the line from having a nuclear-weapons program but 
not enough fissile material to build a bomb, to assembling its first device. It 
not only has enough plutonium for at least one weapon; it has probably built 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Bush Administration looked the other way, the door shut on the 
opportunity to deter North Korean proliferation. Now the Clinton Administration 
must contain the North's nuclear ambitions. The three goals should be: to 
ensure that the North never uses its nuclear arsenal, small though it may be; 
to forestall the construction of even more nuclear weapons, and to see the 
North's nuclear capability dismantled. A fourth aim, if North Korea does not 
respond rationally to these initiatives, is to prevent the outbreak of a second 
Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, there is no alternative to living with a nuclear North, while 
mobilizing world support to ensure that Kim Il Sung finds it difficult to add 
to his atomic stockpile and is provided inducements to dismantle it.  
</P>
<P>
 Many say that it is time to consider sanctions to force North Korea to accept 
full International Atomic Energy Agency inspections. But it is difficult to 
enact sanctions and harder still to enforce them without the enthusiastic 
participation of South Korea, China and Japan, the nations that should be the 
most concerned about an evolving nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula. 
Nonetheless, sanctions remain one of the few instruments of coercion left short 
of war. But they must be requested by Asian nations, not the United States 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 A critical point is approaching that presents to the international community 
both an opportunity and a danger. The North has operated a 30-megawatt reactor 
for many years. Nuclear physics dictates that July would be the best time for 
the routine of extracting the reactor's load of uranium fuel rods and their 
plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ashton Carter, assistant secretary of defense for international 
security affairs, has suggested that the shutdown could safely be postponed for 
roughly a year, it is in the interest of non-proliferation to see that the core 
is removed expeditiously and under safeguards; that is, in July, not 
indefinitely later.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead of setting dates for additional inspections of the reprocessing plant 
at Yongbyon, the U.N. Security Council should call on North Korea to replace 
the reactor core this summer, with the IAEA observing to ensure against 
diversion of the plutonium. The spent fuel rods should be removed from the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the North Koreans do not need to reprocess the uranium to support their 
existing and planned reactors, this represents no hardship to the country -- if 
it still desires a non-nuclear Korean peninsula, as it has repeatedly asserted. 
The plutonium has some potential value as a supplement to reactor fuel, and the 
government could be compensated generously for that resource, even if such 
payment were perceived as being a payoff for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 If, however, North Korea intends to expand its nuclear arsenal, as the 
evidence of the last IAEA inspection indicates, refusal of the Security Council 
order would be a clear signal. The world community would be justified in using 
some means of coercion to get North Korea to live up to its treaty obligations 
to become and remain a non-nuclear-armed state.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE MIDDLE EAST; ARAFAT MUST HAVE HIS ALTALENA; ISRAEL AND THE 
PALESTINIANS WILL MAKE NO PROGRESS UNTIL EACH SIDE TAKES ACTION AGAINST ITS OWN 
EXTREMISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID BIALE, David Biale is a professor of Jewish history at the Graduate 
Theological Union in Berkeley. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On June 20, 1948, a ship named the Altalena appeared off the coast of Tel 
Aviv, just over a month after Israel declared its independence. Loaded with 
arms intended for the Irgun Zva'i Leumi, the right-wing underground army under 
Menachem Begin, the ship constituted the most serious challenge to the 
sovereignty of the the new Israeli government. When negotiations between Prime 
Minister David Ben Gurion and the Irgun broke down, Ben Gurion ordered that the 
ship be sunk, despite the threat of civil war in the middle of Israel's 
desperate war for survival. Although Jewish lives were lost and valuable arms 
destroyed, Ben Gurion's action saved the new Jewish state from extreme elements 
that might have ultimately torpedoed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Every revolution has its Altalena. In 1921, Lenin did not hesitate to fire on 
Soviet sailors in Kronstad who demanded a more radical revolution. Revolutions 
by their nature arouse extreme groups to undertake extreme actions. Yet, the 
readiness of revolutionary leaders to suppress their extreme allies is a test 
of their ability to move from struggle to statecraft. Without Altalena, there 
follows anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Yasser Arafat faces his Altalena. The Islamic fundamentalist Hamas is 
not satisfied with the compromise course of the Oslo agreement between Israel 
and the Palestine Liberation Organization and it will shun no act of terror to 
sabotage it. A hideous car bombing in Afula and a shooting in Ashdod were the 
latest fruits of this terror. 
</P>
<P>
 If Arafat wants to lead a state and not just a revolution, he must not only 
condemn, but vigorously -- even violently -- destroy these rejectionists. His 
failure to even condemn the Afula bombing is an ominous sign not only of a 
moral failure, but, more important, of a failure of political will. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the excuses for Arafat's silence have been heard before: He is already 
besieged by opponents and cannot risk alienating them further. And, how can he 
condemn such violence when his people live under occupation, themselves victims 
of continuing depredations and degradations, whether from right-wing settlers 
or from the Israeli army itself. 
</P>
<P>
 All this is true. It is also beside the point. Arafat will not have his state 
if he will not first have his Altalena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gaza-Jericho agreement, for all its flaws, provides Arafat with the 
opportunity not to only condemn but also to act. This is the most compelling 
reason for both Israel and the PLO to move as quickly as possible toward 
implementing the accord and withdrawing the Israeli army from these 
territories. The result may well be civil war between the Palestinians, but if 
it is, it is in Israel's -- and the world's -- interest to make sure it is a 
civil war that the PLO wins. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat is not the only one who faces his Altalena. Yitzhak Rabin also 
confronts a racial element that will do everything to sabotage the nascent 
peace. The settlers in Hebron and Kiryat Araba are preparing for a modern-day 
Masada in the event that Rabin decides to force them out of their provocative 
and counter-productive settlements. Rabin has so far taken some small, but 
significant actions against the most extreme of the settlers; he has also 
condemned Jewish violence in terms that might serve Arafat as a model. But the 
real test for Rabin -- and for Israel as a society -- is still to come. 
Predictions of full-scale civil war may be exaggerated, but there is little 
doubt that significant violence is highly probable. 
</P>
<P>
 For both sides to have their Altalena today requires some faith that the other 
side is worth the sacrifice. If Israel risks civil war for peace with the 
Palestinians, will the Palestinians be able to keep their end? And, if the PLO 
destroys the Hamas, will it get what it wants -- a Palestinian state -- from 
the Israelis? Each side can only create the trust in the other by undertaking 
actions against its own extremists. Verbal condemnations of terrorism by one's 
own compatriots are only the first step. Concrete actions are just as 
important. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1948, one of the commanders who gave the direct order to fire on the 
Altalena was a young officer of the Israeli army, Yitzhak Rabin. Will he have 
the courage to give a similar order, if necessary, today? But at least Rabin 
has a clear record in this regard. Arafat is a greater enigma and, on the basis 
of his record to date, we may justifiably wonder if he can rise to the 
challenge.

O.C. ART / CATHY CURTIS; MYSTICAL TOUR NOT QUITE MAGICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There is something almost mystical about good abstract art. Like a riveting 
stage performance, it projects an aura of intense conviction and concentration. 
While some abstraction makes a purely sensory or intellectual appeal, other 
works contain a palpable spiritual content. 
</P>
<P>
 But the stakes are very high: Claim a spiritual basis for your art, and you 
will be held up to the standards of the world's masters, whether they be the 
anonymous craftsmen of an African village or such Western modernist heroes as 
Wassily Kandinsky, Mark Rothko or John McLaughlin. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Laguna Art Museum, where "Augustus Vincent Tack: Landscape of the 
Spirit" is the centerpiece through May 8, two smaller shows display other 
attempts to engage matters of the spirit. While Tack drew on Asian art forms 
for his abstracted landscapes of the 1920s and '30s, a later generation of 
artists was intrigued with the intersection of nature, Eastern religions and 
the gestural invention that was the legacy of Abstract Expressionism. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, most of the art in "Vertigo Journey: The Early Assemblage of 
Seymour Locks, 1949-1959" and "Toward Stillness" (both through May 1) falls far 
short of the mystical ideal. 
</P>
<P>
 Seymour Locks' nail pieces from the '50s seem obsessive, but in a studiously 
organized way. Hundreds of nails driven into redwood and eucalyptus stumps form 
undulating patterns that variously resemble cell colonies, wind-blown stretches 
of beach fence or the shimmering scales of a small reptile. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist is quoted in an authoritative catalogue essay by Bruce Nixon, 
editor of Artweek magazine, as saying that these pieces are "not embroidered 
surfaces . . . not decoration." In Locks' view, the sculptures are landscapes 
and meditations -- "places" containing "energy" that the nails tap into and 
bring to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 It must have been immensely satisfying to make the repetitive hammering 
movements and to watch patterns of overlapping or carefully spaced nailheads 
take shape, sparked here and there with snarls of twisted wire, bits of 
hammered foil or tufts of scrap metal. But style is a fickle thing: Decades 
later, the pieces belie Locks' claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than tapping reserves of psychic power, in the manner of a West African 
fetish, Locks' sculptures in this show have the earnestly inventive quality of 
eccentric crafts projects. (In fact, the earliest nail pieces represented the 
artist's first, unschooled attempt at making sculpture after years of making 
Abstract Expressionist paintings.) 
</P>
<P>
 The patterns are too predictable, too small-scale and tidily decorative to 
evoke mysterious or powerful forces. If Locks is a shaman, as Nixon 
affectionately dubs him, his powers seem awfully limited. As the inheritor of a 
Dada sensibility, he seems lacking in inventiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting director Susan M. Anderson, the show's curator, perhaps best defines 
his work in her catalogue essay by comparing it with the abstract paintings of 
the Los Angeles-based Dynaton group of the 1940s and '50s, which turned 
landscape features into "diagrams of energy patterns -- moving whorls of 
animated dots." 
</P>
<P>
 In other assemblages from the period, Locks incorporated such industrial 
materials as a mop head, a fire sprinkler or car horns in studied ways that 
read as consciously "aesthetic" rather than subversively psychological. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Excavation," from 1959, Locks offers something at once funky and 
expressive: an open box covered only with a layer of resin, through which the 
viewer can spy what appears to be a tiny black bar stool marooned in a grotto 
of shimmering silver walls -- perhaps a vision of urban hell. 
</P>
<P>
 The up-and-coming Funk generation -- including Wally Hedrick (one of Locks' 
students), Wallace Berman and Jay de Feo -- would push Locks' experiments much 
further into the realm of the weird and the personal. The spiritual component 
in their art, however, would be more elusive and subversive, streaked with 
black humor and an anarchic view of contemporary life. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A shared love for the rural life knitted together the four artist friends in 
"Toward Stillness." Joachim Smith was in his early 30s when he started teaching 
at Cal State Fullerton in 1962, where Tom Holste, Bob Schmid and Doug Smith 
were his students a few years later. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the heyday of Pop Art in the United States, and "fetish finish" in Los 
Angeles, but -- as Joachim Smith writes in a gracefully impassioned essay -- 
his group "did not want things too slick or too easy, much less too L.A. We did 
not want our work too urban, street-smart and glib. Above (or below) all, we 
did not want to be 'tough-minded' so much as grounded." 
</P>
<P>
 What they did want, he writes, was to examine such things as "the importance 
of gesture" and to experience the rhythm of "moving through the canvas space in 
small, densely layered increments." 
</P>
<P>
 They drew inspiration from many sources, including the Orange County 
landscape; Eastern religions; nature worship in North and South American 
cultures; the directness of painter John McLaughlin, their Orange County 
neighbor; the "white writing" of Northwestern painter Mark Tobey, and the soft 
grids of painter Agnes Martin, who lived in New Mexico for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 Joachim Smith was by far the most successful of the four in setting up a 
resonance between marks on paper and things of the spirit. Each of the large 
paintings from the '60s features a densely intricate graphite web bordered by 
crisp vertical lines, on an all-over painted ground that grows paler near the 
edges of the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 With titles like "Dhuma Marga (Path of Smoke)," these works convey a 
meditative quality without visual content, an alpha state that one might 
achieve by staring fixedly at a wisp of smoke. The focused yet obsessive energy 
of the hand that drew the webs transmits itself to the viewer as a persistent 
yet non-specific force, the visual equivalent of a continuous low hum. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cautious vertical framing lines in the paintings leach away this 
intensity, reminding the viewer that the paintings are really just arbitrary 
human designs. Smith, who is a serious student of Zen philosophy, probably had 
reasons for organizing his works in this manner. But it is possible to confuse 
zealous interpretation of an idea with the most effective way to convey it 
visually. 
</P>
<P>
 To these eyes, the paintings would be far more powerful without the fussy 
parentheses, as trails of energy knitting themselves into cosmic patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 Holste's untitled airbrush paintings from the '60s envelop the viewer in what 
appear to be out-of-focus patterns of light and dark. Depending on the colors 
Holste employed, these giant swaths look rather like hugely magnified views of 
water or sky or the effect you get when you squeeze your eyes tightly. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect is dreamlike in a laid-back way. The paintings conjure neither the 
stillness of the void nor the roiling eventfulness of a drug trip. There's no 
nirvana here, no feeling of discovery, just a warm bath in sense-surround. 
</P>
<P>
 Striated with a palette knife and sprinkled with mica chips, Doug Smith's 
paintings are totally bound up in surface effects. Although the all-over 
glitter effect occasionally resembles the paintings of Mary Corse, it lacks the 
tantalizingly austere radiance of her canvases. Smith's strategies seem 
constrained and dull, removed even from convincing evocations of landscape 
formations. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmid's paintings unfortunately resemble painted gift wrap. Gluey skeins of 
color are used in a predictable way to represent the seasons ("Indian Summer," 
"Fall's Anticipation"). Each canvas sports a contrasting horizontal color bar 
in the approximate position of a letter slot in a door. It might have been 
intended to represent a moment of insight in the continuum of perception, but 
the overall effect is too glib to evoke a meditative tone. 
</P>
<P>
 The show also documents how the four artists' styles have become more literal, 
sometimes tediously so, over the years. Bolton Colburn, the museum's curator of 
collections, tactfully remarks in a wall statement that "these works may seem 
less than aesthetically viable, but for these artists, the art world itself had 
become less than viable." 
</P>
<P>
 Schmid turned to amateurish compositions incorporating dime-store lizards, 
shells and other objects from the natural world, Holste concentrated on 
painting rocks, and Doug Smith's recent work includes a dated-looking painting 
of eucalyptus leaves silhouetted against the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 The best of these recent works in the show are Joachim Smith's elaborate 
pen-and-ink studies of falling birds, symbolic of the increasing displacement 
of the natural world. Passionately and minutely observed, the birds sometimes 
suffer the additional indignity of a light dusting of gold leaf. (Gold in a 
Tibetan painting is one thing; in a contemporary art context, however, the 
immediate reference is glitz, not glory.) 
</P>
<P>
 There may be many roads to enlightenment, but few that lead to favorable 
evaluation by the powers that be in the art world. The geometric paintings of 
McLaughlin from the 1950s and '60s -- also based on Zen philosophy -- are now 
considered seminal modernist works, while the art of the four men in this show 
has never been widely honored. 
</P>
<P>
 Joachim Smith, who celebrates the "bodily experience" of making art as primary 
in his essay, criticizes McLaughlin's paintings (and the work of the "light and 
space" artists of the 1970s) as "generally mechanical, even remote," with 
"concept and/or dramatic effect" superseding "the intimate personal touch." 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly in the context of work inspired by a global philosophical 
outlook, this carping seems small-minded. Why is a physical reaction somehow 
more genuine than a mental reaction? Why is the artist's visceral experience in 
making the work somehow more important than the viewer's mental activity in 
viewing it? 
</P>
<P>
 Being able to trace the movements of the artist's hand can be deeply 
satisfying (in fact, brush strokes are visible in the McLaughlin paintings I've 
seen), but surely a Zen follower could make a case for, say, a James Turrell 
light piece that depends largely on the vagaries of a natural phenomenon rather 
than fallible human desires. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It should be noted that both shows are accompanied by publications that add 
insight and context -- an emphasis on education and documentation that has 
become a hallmark of Laguna Art Museum shows during the past few years. One 
particularly imaginative format -- Joachim Smith's handwritten essay for 
"Toward Stillness," reproduced on sheets of stapled gray paper -- serves as 
proof that elegant and useful guides can also be cheap and casual. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Vertigo Journey: The Early Assemblage of Seymour Locks, 1949-1965" and 
"Toward Stillness: Joachim Smith, Tom Holste, Doug Smith and Bob Schmid" remain 
through May 1 at the Laguna Art Museum, 307 Cliff Drive, Laguna Beach. Hours: 
11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. Admission: $4 adults, $3 seniors and 
students, free for children under 12. (714) 494-8971.

MUSIC REVIEWS; BRASS MELDS FUN AND SKILL IN A GEM OF A SHOW; DONNING WHITE

 In its performance at the Orange County Performing Arts Center on Sunday 
night, the Canadian Brass avoided many extremes. There was nothing too slow, 
nothing too dissonant, nothing too intellectual, nothing too new and nothing 
too esoteric. Yet, given the limited palette the concert accommodated, the 
musicians offered lots of fun, and plenty of ability. 
</P>
<P>
 The five instrumentalists -- trumpeters Frederic Mills and Ronald Romm, 
hornist David Ohanian, trombonist Eugene Watts and tubist Charles Daellenbach 
-- entered from the rear of the hall, spiffily tail-coated -- and arrayed in 
matching white jogging shoes, complete with red racing stripes. They 
accompanied their entrance with a boisterous, New Orleans jazz-style 
arrangement by Don Gillis of "Closer Walk," and closed the evening by mincing 
their way through two similar encores, both arranged by Luther Henderson -- 
"Tuba Tiger Rag" and "Saint's Hallelujah." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the concert, presented by the Orange County Philharmonic Society, 
musical aspects coexisted with staging. Beneath the jester's hat in Henderson's 
adaptation of highlights from Verdi's "Rigoletto," beyond the humorous 
introductory comments and besides the silly antics that went along with many of 
the selections, the Brass brought attentive musicianship to its work. The five 
matched one another in virtuosic feats and, when called upon, switched gears to 
attend to more refined repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the hands of the quintet minus Daellenbach, Giovanni Gabrieli's antiphonal 
Canzona No. 1, "La Spiritata" emerged pristine and graceful (written to take 
advantage of the two choir lofts in St. Mark's Cathedral in Venice, it was 
played from positions on either side of the stage and hall). Ives' Variations 
on "America" received a bright, consistently crisp reading, despite 
mock-puzzled head-shaking over the most dissonant variation. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the concert featured arrangements that were not always successful. As 
adapted by Fen Watkin, the Overture to Mozart's "Zauberflote" translated to 
brass surprisingly well, but Arthur Frackenpohl's version of "Summer," from 
"The Four Seasons," by Vivaldi could not convert the idiomatic string writing 
of the original into convincing brass parts, no matter how accomplished the 
five protagonists proved themselves. Chris Dedrick transformed three popular, 
charming pieces from the "Anna Magdalena Bach Notebook" (identified in 
erroneous order in the program) into slick film music.

 * Backing 'Tales' Sequel: Arthur J. Kropp, president of the 300,000-member 
nonpartisan group People For the American Way, has denounced PBS for its 
decision not to co-finance a sequel to Armistead Maupin's popular "Tales of the 
City" series. Said Kropp: "It's a bad omen for free speech when a few angry 
activists are allowed to control what the rest of us can watch on TV. We call 
on PBS to reconsider this decision, which amounts to blatant self-censorship." 
Maupin has said PBS balked from funding the sequel because of opposition from 
the Religious Right; PBS said the funds are needed for other programming.

 * Reitman Works 'Late Shift': Film producer Ivan Reitman, whose credits 
include "Dave," "Ghostbusters" and "Kindergarten Cop," has signed to produce 
"The Late Shift" for HBO Pictures. The cable movie, based on the book by New 
York Times reporter Bill Carter, details the behind-the-scenes battle between 
Jay Leno and David Letterman to succeed Johnny Carson as the "King of Late 
Night." . . . And speaking of Leno, the "Tonight Show" host will kick off 
Sunday's "Earthwalk '94," an environmental benefit beginning at 10 a.m. on the 
back lot of Burbank's Universal Studios and passing through the nearby studios 
of Disney, Warner Bros., NBC and Sony Pictures. Other celebrities taking part 
include Chevy Chase, Ted Danson, Leslie Nielsen and "Beverly Hills, 90210's" 
Ian Ziering.

 No Cuts for 'Schindler's': Distributors of Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's

following that country's governmental requirement that several scenes depicting 
sex and violence be cut. The Malaysian censorship board had originally banned 
the film in its entirety because of what it called Jewish propaganda but later 
agreed to allow it if the offending scenes were cut. Spielberg has refused any

 Tchaikovsky's Return: Russia's prestigious International Tchaikovsky 
Competition, which was believed to have folded after the breakup of the Soviet 
Union because of lack of funding, will return to Moscow this year as scheduled. 
Japan-based Pioneer Electronics contributed $600,000 -- more than 60% of the 
event's costs -- to facilitate the June resumption of the world's most famous 
classical competition for piano, violin and voice. Pioneer said the sponsorship 
is its way of helping "in Russia's difficult times," although an official told 
the Soviet news agency ITAR-Tass that Pioneer is wary about publicizing its 
role. Four years ago, the firm was accused by some Russians of having 
influenced the awarding of the first prize in the violin competition to a 
Japanese musician. The competition -- held every four years -- began in 1957.

MUSIC REVIEW; ANONYMOUS FOUR FIND PERFECT VENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Site and sound merged sublimely when the acclaimed a cappella group Anonymous 
Four brought a glorious program of 13th- and 14th-Century vocal music to 
Westminster Presbyterian Church in Pasadena, as part of the Chamber Music in 
Historic Sites series. Whatever the innate luster of the group's "English 
Ladymass," hearing it in a complementary venue Sunday did wonders to enhance 
its character. 
</P>
<P>
 This extravagant Gothic Revival edifice, towering above its Lake Street 
neighbors, supports a pleasant illusion of antiquity -- a highly relative term 
in Southern California. But even if this 1928 structure is roughly 600 years 
younger than the music heard here, its sound-expanding, high vaulting ceilings 
and blend of architectural severity and opulence suited the music beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Anonymous Four, currently ensemble-in-residence at St. Michael's 
Church in New York City, anonymity amounts to a noble aspiration, as per the 
medieval liturgical practice. While the singers -- Ruth Cunningham, Marsha 
Genesky, Susan Hellauer and Johanna Rose -- create a seamless collective blend 
and move and breathe as one, they also possess distinct traits of timbre and 
expression. The group's ascendance, via high ranking on the classical charts, 
plus generous media exposure, speaks well of their finely honed virtues, sonic 
purity and sense of purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the highlights in the program, sponsored by the Da Camera Society of 
Mount St. Mary's College, were the "Kyrie: Kyria Christifera," with its 
enchanting, tautly navigated ornamentation, and the lively flow of the round on 
"Rota: Munda Maria." A particularly dark, arid passion suffused "Sequence/Song: 
Jesu Cristes mile moder." The piece, concerning the Virgin's lament upon 
Christ's death, is a sorrow-drenched duet in which pitches at close range weave 
and converge. 
</P>
<P>
 On this afternoon, everything seemed to work. A consummate performance was 
delivered in a congenial setting, sans interruption of intermission or 
applause. Religious aspects aside, an air of communion took over the chapel and 
a profound effect, so it seemed, was felt by all.JOSEF WOODARD

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: 'DANCING MOTHERS' LEADS SILENT MOVIE BILL

 The Silent Movie, 611 N. Fairfax, has an especially strong lineup this week. 
Screening Wednesday at 8 p.m. is Herbert Brenon's terse, brief "Dancing 
Mothers" (1926) in which a patrician Alice Joyce rebels against her 
self-absorbed flapper daughter (Clara Bow) and her two-timing husband; never 
was there a pithier comment on Roaring '20s mores and morals. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing with it is none other than the heady original vamp movie, "A Fool 
There Was" (1915) with the smoldering Theda Bara.  
</P>
<P>
 "Moran of the Lady Letty" (1922) will screen Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. 
Dorothy Dalton has the title role as the tomboyish daughter of seafarers who 
crosses paths with a shanghaied San Francisco playboy (Rudolph Valentino); as a 
sea adventure the film rambles, but the teaming of the plain Dalton with the 
spectacular Valentino proves quite touching and credible under George Melford's 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The film allows Valentino to play the kind of athletic hero typified by 
Douglas Fairbanks but with a nonchalant charm all his own. (Be on the look out 
for George O'Brien, later the star of "The Iron Horse" and "Sunrise," and 
Hopalong Cassidy himself, William Boyd, in small roles.

 A Stripper's Life: In his sketchy but appealing "Glamazon: A Different Kind of 
Girl" (at the Sunset 5 Fridays and Saturdays at midnight, Saturdays and Sundays 
at 11 a.m.) documentarian Rico Martinez follows irrepressible 60-plus stripper 
Barbara LeMay back to her birthplace, Morgantown, W. Va., where she was born 
Sammy Hoover. Totally self-enchanted but affectionate and caring of others, the 
gaudy Le May is endearing.  
</P>
<P>
 However, the time Martinez indulges in staging some amateurish and pointless 
dramatizations of some of LeMay's earthier anecdotes would have been better 
spent in interviewing those who knew her better than her understandably rather 
perplexed -- but admirably hospitable and accepting -- hometown friends and 
relatives who hadn't seen seen her in 30 years or more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Glamazon" is likable, but there seems to be a more substantial and 
illuminating film to be made of LeMay and her life.

 AIDS Diary: When Canadian physician Dr. Peter Jepson-Young learned he had AIDS 
in 1990, he fought back in a unique manner, commencing a series of two-minute 
video diaries, which aired weekly on Canadian TV. What began as a way to give 
meaning to his life and his struggle for survival became an educational and 
inspirational experience for his viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now filmmaker David Paperny has culled from some 285 minutes of diary footage 
the graceful, altogether extraordinary 45-minute Oscar-nominated "The Broadcast 
Tapes of Dr. Peter" (at the Nuart at 11 a.m. Saturday and Sunday only). 
</P>
<P>
 A good-looking man with a gift for communication, Jepson-Young seems to be 
able to talk easily about all aspects of his life. He tells us what it's like 
to have grown up in a conservative family where he felt he could not tell his 
parents about his homosexuality, just as he explains what's happening to him as 
Kaposi's Sarcoma proceeds on its relentless course. 
</P>
<P>
 He faces the loss of his sight heroically, saying that he can see all the more 
clearly the new man in his life by not having been distracted by superficial 
appearances. He shares with us his spiritual quest and, later on, we sit in on 
a living will planning session with his sister and closest colleagues and even 
witness him visiting with his parents the plot where he will be buried. 
</P>
<P>
 By this time Jepson-Young, now accepting the inevitable, looks far older than 
his middle-aged father.  
</P>
<P>
 In facing death, Jepson-Young, quite simply, learned how to make the most of 
life, setting an example for all people of all ages and regardless of sexual 
orientation or state of health.

TV REVIEWS; 'SAME DIFFERENCE' FACES PREJUDICE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ethnic understanding is the theme of today's earnest CBS Schoolbreak Special, 
"Same Difference," as the friendship and growing romantic attachment between 
two high school seniors -- one Catholic, one Jewish -- is threatened by the 
prejudices of their families and peers. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Goldstein family moves into a predominantly Italian American 
neighborhood, local youths express their scorn by hanging bagels from a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 One youth, Vinnie di Fazio (Skeet Ulrich), changes his mind when he meets 
pretty Shelly Goldstein (Leslie Hibbard) and their friendship rapidly blooms 
into romance -- as uneasy relatives and friends deliver "stick to your own 
kind" messages. 
</P>
<P>
 A blowup between Vinnie's "my best friend is Jewish" Uncle Joe and Shelly's 
dad seems to put an end to the relationship, until writer Willy Holtzman wraps 
it up with a happy, though unconvincing, about-face where humanity prevails, 
the two families decide to observe Easter and Passover together and everyone 
beams as Vinnie and Shelly embrace. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast is likable enough to make you want to believe in happy endings, 
however, and Holtzman and director Stacy Cochran offer a refreshing sidebar on 
teen-agers and education: Neither Shelly nor Vinnie is at the top of their 
class, but they care about getting the grades to make it into college.

TV REVIEWS; A LOOK AT PAST, FUTURE OF 'AIDS RESEARCH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Human nature is perhaps HIV's best friend, and something no scientist on Earth 
can combat. But human nature contains hope along with risk-taking, and the 
scientists hunting for a vaccine or cure for the virus may be feeling a new 
surge of optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 At least, that's the strong impression left by the WGBH-produced "AIDS 
Research: The Story So Far." Writer-producer Jon Palfreman squeezes much of the 
13 years of frustrating research and scientific dead-ends into a few minutes, 
but the summary -- along with an animated graphics sequence illustrating the 
molecular activity -- helps explain why a cure for AIDS remains so elusive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such past "breakthroughs" as the AZT vaccine proved easily surmountable by the 
AIDS virus' startling ability to mutate. Rarely has television science so 
lucidly visualized how a virus is like any living thing, forever searching for 
means to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 The virus' skill at mutating makes it able to penetrate cells and take over 
the body's genetic structure. Current drugs can only slow this mutation 
process, but sooner or later, one or more of the thousands of various strains 
of the disease will defeat the drug's effect. And scientists such as Ronald 
Desrosiers of the New England Primate Research Center found little hope in 
conventional therapies. 
</P>
<P>
 Palfreman's report dwells largely on the impact of Desrosiers' very 
unconventional therapy, which emerged from studies with his primates 
deliberately infected with an injected HIV strain. The injected strain, 
consisting of a weakened virus in which key genes were removed, is called an 
attenuated vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the monkeys with this vaccine showed no signs of the primate form of 
AIDS in four years, Desrosiers argues that it may be time for human 
experiments. His case is further boosted by the small population of 
HIV-resistant patients, who appear as healthy today as the day they contracted 
the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Institutes of Health's Anthony Fauci, long accused by AIDS 
research activists of an overly slow and deliberate approach to finding a cure, 
does nothing here to change that image. Fauci wonders if biochemists and 
society at large would be willing to try Desrosiers' radical test and later 
voices the possibility that a cure for AIDS may never be found. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But activist Martin Delaney argues convincingly that such a test has a willing 
test group, including himself, and that no durable vaccine will be discovered 
without some risk. Besides, biomedical ethicist Arthur Caplan reminds, the 
pandemic levels of AIDS-related death in Africa and now in Asia call for 
aggressive therapies. 
</P>
<P>
 When the words, "the most formidable microbe in history" come out of the mouth 
of narrator Will Lyman, they carry an extra ominous tone. If science history 
suggests anything, no "Manhattan Project" for AIDS -- as ACT-UP and its allies 
demand -- will break what amounts to a plague in the Third World. Instead, like 
the discovery of rubber, a breakthrough will probably happen when scientists 
least expect it. 
</P>

 KNOWING HORROR: As the nation looks back this month at the Holocaust a 
half-century ago, Hooman Mobassery, a senior at UC Irvine, urged the UCI 
Student Center to do something special. The result of his efforts: A two-day 
session called "Never Again" begins on campus today. Panel discussions cover 
World War II genocide plus similar tragedies in Bosnia and elsewhere. . . . A 
special session: A candlelight memorial outside the student center at 7:30 
tonight for the children of the Holocaust.

 SOMEBODY'S ART: Do rap music and graffiti-inspired paintings by such artists 
as Chaz Bojorquez deserve the same valid cultural expressions as, say, the Mona 
Lisa? Yes, says Andrew Connors, a curator at the Smithsonian Institution. It's 
among the topics he and Bojorquez will discuss Saturday at Bowers Museum of 
Cultural Art, part of a four-day cultural series (F3). . . . "You don't have to 
appeal to all people," Connors says. "There's not a single work of art that 
everyone can agree that they like."

 MIGHTY BRONZE: You say you're a true Mighty Ducks fan? You've got the official 
horn, T-shirt and cap, even one of those Mighty Ducks pucks you'll never use? 
But . . . do you have a limited edition bronze sculpture of Wild Wing, the 
mascot? The work is called "Defending the Pond," and it was created for Disney 
by veteran hockey sculptor Steve Landis of Denver. They're available in 
Disneyland's New Orleans Square -- for $975. . . . And yes, fans are buying: 
Four have sold there so far.

 DATE WITH AN ANGEL: Curt Earnest of Westminster has skipped work the past 12 
years to be at Anaheim Stadium for the California Angels' opening day (B1, C1). 
So no surprise that Earnest, 32, and a friend had their car first in line 
waiting for the gates to open at 11 a.m. Monday. . . . "We thought they opened 
at 10:30. We wanted to get here as early as we could," Earnest said, "just to 
soak it all up -- batting practice, getting autographs. It makes it more 
exciting."

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; HEADS SHOULD ROLL OVER CLAS SCANDAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California spent $15 million a year ago for a much-needed new system of tests 
designed to better measure what public-school students were actually learning 
and how well equipped they were to meet the future. Now it appears that a San 
Jose principal's description of the exercise as a "waste of money" was apt: The 
scoring was marked by outrageous errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature should demand an explanation from the 
state Education Department, and the department should re-evaluate the company 
that administered the tests and those state officials who supervised the 
company. If people have to be removed, so be it. The errors must not be 
repeated. 
</P>
<P>
 One million pupils in the fourth, eighth and 10th grades took the new 
California Learning Assessment System (CLAS) tests for reading, writing and 
mathematics. Education Department officials argued there was not enough time or 
money to score all the tests, so only about half were graded. But a computer 
analysis by The Times showed numerous instances where the state failed to meet 
its own guidelines of scoring at least 25% of the exams taken at every school. 
Thus the results of the tests were far less accurate than promised. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, for example, there were six schools where less than 25% of 
the tests were scored. In a San Bernardino County middle school, only 1% of the 
math tests were scored. 
</P>
<P>
 At Roosevelt Elementary in Indio, 169 students took the tests, but only four 
papers were graded. The results reported that everyone scored at the lowest 
possible level in mathematics. The principal was right to be furious. Her 
school has been maligned, with blame reflecting onto her and her teachers. 
Worse, she cannot know if the state "grade" given to the school is largely 
correct, half right, mostly wrong or totally bogus. How can she know what, if 
anything, needs fixing? 
</P>
<P>
 These were not harmless errors. The results prompted parents to ask private 
schools about getting their children admitted; there were renewed calls to 
break up the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The CLAS methods and goals remain promising. Multiple-choice exams have been 
replaced by tests requiring students to write some answers and explain how they 
solved a problem. Students are not graded against one another but against a 
fixed standard. The state hopes eventually to test all pupils, if the 
Legislature funds the exams each year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rush to put the testing in place needlessly provided ammunition to the 
critics of the new system. In such a sensitive, vital area as children's 
education, mistakes like this one cost too dearly. Fix the errors before giving 
the tests again. The promised apologies will not make up for the harm that has 
been done.

NOT QUITE AN OPENER-AND-SHUT CASE; BASEBALL: TRAILING THE INDIANS BY EIGHT RUNS 
IN THE NINTH INNING, THE ANGELS COME BACK -- BUT STILL LOSE, 9-6. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The game was ugly, lopsided. There was absolutely no reason for anyone but the 
ushers to be hanging around past the sixth inning Monday at the Angels' home 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet most of the 37,285 fans refused to leave Anaheim Stadium, hoping that one 
player might appear and save the day. 
</P>
<P>
 His name? Bo Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson strode to the plate in position to culminate one of the greatest 
comebacks in franchise history. He struck out, but it was as if it didn't 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The game will go down as a 9-6 defeat by the Cleveland Indians, but the 
Angels' ninth-inning rally changed the day's perception. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may get an 'L' in the 'lost' column but it was actually a victory," Angel 
second baseman Harold Reynolds said. "I think the ninth inning was an epitome 
of what this club can do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels struck out four times in the inning, never getting anything more 
than a single, but everything was done with a flair for the dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just when you think you've seen it all, something new comes up," Cleveland 
Manager Mike Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland began the ninth with a 9-1 lead, but Angel pitcher Mark Langston -- 
who will undergo arthroscopic elbow surgery today -- told Jackson to get ready, 
that he would be pinch-hitting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at him like he was crazy," said Jackson, who'd spent the day on the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland reliever Eric Plunk struck out Jim Edmonds and Dwight Smith, and 
then . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Salmon walked. Chili Davis singled. Spike Owen singled. Eduardo Perez 
walked. Chris Turner struck out, but, the ball bounced past catcher Tony Pena, 
and Turner reached first on a passed ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Plunk then threw 11 pitches to Reynolds, nine of which were fouled back. The 
next went into right field for another run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried not to look at (Plunk's) face," Reynolds said. "But the one time I 
did, it was like, 'Man, what are you doing?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Mesa relieved Plunk and was greeted by a two-run single by Gary 
DiSarcina. Suddenly the score was 9-6, there were runners on first and third, 
and guess who was coming to the plate? 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson emerged from the dugout and the fans rose, delivering a thunderous 
ovation. They had been calling for him since the sixth inning, but Manager Buck 
Rodgers had wanted to wait for the right moment. This was it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping he'd hit another like the one in the Freeway Series," Reynolds 
said. "If anyone can hit one out, it's Bo. He's got that timing and that 
flair." 
</P>
<P>
 Hargrove, realizing that very thing, went to his bullpen and chose Steve Farr, 
who was Jackson's teammate for five years in Kansas City. Farr, equally 
familiar with Jackson's abilities, wasn't about to add another chapter to the 
legend. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a little more pressure in that situation," Farr said. "If you lose a 
game like that, it really looks bad. He's a home run hitter. I wasn't going to 
give him anything to hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jackson, "I went up there for one reason, and that was to try to tie the 
game. I wasn't looking for a base hit. I was looking to hit (a homer)." 
</P>
<P>
 Farr started off with a slider in the dirt but Jackson swung and missed. Then, 
on a 3-2 pitch, Farr came back with the same pitch. Jackson swung again . . . 
and missed again, ending the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "They got away with this one," Jackson said. "But to be poised and come back 
like we did, that says a lot about us. We didn't pull it off, but we hung in 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just can't wait until the ninth inning to do something big." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' biggest immediate obstacle will be coping without Langston, who 
will have bone chips removed. Dr. Lewis Yocum, who will perform the surgery, 
expects Langston to return in six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he'll have any problem coming back that quickly," said Joe 
Magrane, who also is recovering from elbow surgery. "If there was ever a guy 
who was invincible, it's Mark. He has just kept himself in such great shape." 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane is expected to be returning quickly himself. He worked out before 
Monday's game and said he'll be ready to rejoin the rotation by the first week 
of May. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the best stuff I've had since coming back," said Magrane, who underwent 
arthroscopic surgery Feb. 15. "I don't even think about the elbow anymore. I'm 
close." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Angels will have to hope there are few starting performances 
such as John Dopson's. He yielded eight hits -- two of them home runs -- and 
six runs (five earned) in 5 1/3 innings. Reliever Bob Patterson fared little 
better, yielding three runs and a homer in two-thirds of an inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie right fielder Manny Ramirez, quickly becoming a household name in 
Cleveland, hit a home run off each of them, driving in five runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know who that masked man in right field was, but we better catch that 
name because he took us to the cleaners," Rodgers said. "We just got our butts 
kicked today. They out-hit us. They out-pitched us. They out-gloved us. 
</P>
<P>
 "But everyone knows that at the end, we gave it one hell of a shot."

LANGSTON READY TO HAVE ELBOW SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For more than four years, Angel team orthopedist Dr. Lewis Yocum has kept a 
loose watch on the "loose bodies" in Mark Langston's left elbow. Monday 
morning, he decided they would have to be removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston, who has been on the disabled list only one other time during his 
10-plus major league seasons, will undergo the first surgery of his life at 
about noon today at Centinela Hospital in Inglewood. Yocum is hoping he'll have 
to do nothing more than remove a couple of those bodies -- bone chips -- in an 
arthroscopic procedure that could allow Langston to resume his spot in the 
rotation by the last week in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've known about the bone chips since he came here," Yocum said, "but there 
are a lot of pitchers out there with bone chips and they're not a problem until 
they become symptomatic. For the first time, Mark's chips are now floating 
around and causing trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Yocum said that a preventative procedure in the off-season -- or before 
Langston signed a three-year, $14-million contract this February -- was never 
really considered. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew it was something that could occur but it wasn't like we were waiting 
around to jump into surgery," Yocum said. "He hadn't missed a start in five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We periodically checked it (with X-rays), but there were no previous 
indications or warnings. It's the 'if it ain't broken don't fix it theory.' If 
the chips aren't bothering him, it's pretty hard to talk a guy into a surgery." 
</P>
<P>
 Langston said he never would have consented to such a surgery, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe in maintainance-type surgery," he said. "You don't have 
surgery unless you have a compelling reason." 
</P>
<P>
 Langston, who saw his bone chips on the X-rays taken after he was first 
examined in Minnesota, said he was "pretty much geared up" for Monday's news 
that surgery would be required. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm actually relieved because now that I know they're there, now that I've 
seen them, I would just as soon have them taken out," he said. "I guess they've 
always been there, but they finally just decided to exercise their option." 
</P>
<P>
 Langston felt no discomfort last Tuesday during or after his opening-day 
performance when he pitched 7 2/3 innings and picked up the victory. He thought 
maybe bumping the elbow on a chair in his hotel was a factor, but it wasn't 
until the next day that the elbow "locked up" while he was walking through the 
clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Banging it on the chair may have been a minor factor," Yocum said. "Pitching 
baseballs is probably the major factor." 
</P>
<P>
 Langston spent about 20 minutes after Monday's 9-6 loss to Cleveland lifting 
weights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Dr. Yocum I was going to make it tough for him, but he said that the 
scalpel has a way of getting through it," he said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Yocum, who performed similar procedures on former Angel pitchers John 
Candelaria and Kirk McCaskill, said if everything goes as expected and there is 
no ligament or nerve damage, there is every reason to believe that in six weeks 
Langston will be the same pitcher he was before the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll know more when we get in there and see how many pieces and how many 
changes there are in the elbow," Yocum said. "But if there is no other damage, 
then the percentage of pitchers who come back throwing as hard as ever is 
relatively high. 
</P>
<P>
 "Later this week, we'll begin working on his range of motion and then start 
him on exercises next week. And Mark has an advantage in that he's both 
well-conditioned and physically strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "He asked me how soon he could get on the bike and I told him he could start 
on Wednesday." 
</P>
<P>
 Langston's experience with hospitals is pretty much limited to what he has 
seen on television series, but he says he is not concerned.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been very fortunate to go as long as I have without a major injury," he 
said, "and the chips are in the back of the elbow, in an easy place to get to. 
And the way it happened, the way they just sort of fell into place while I was 
walking, isn't as scary as if I'd thrown a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm also fortunate that I'm living in this age of medical technology. If this 
would have happened even 10 years ago, I probably would have just tried to 
pitch through it until I couldn't go anymore."

 Colorado 8, Philadelphia 7 -- On a day the fans cheered loud and long for John 
Kruk, Dante Bichette silenced them with one swing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bichette hit his fifth homer of the season, a two-run shot in the eighth 
inning that gave the Rockies a victory and spoiled the Phillies' home opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Kruk, activated only six hours after undergoing radiation treatment for 
testicular cancer, got three hits in his first game this year. He came up with 
the tying run on second in the ninth inning with one out, but looked at strike 
three. 
</P>
<P>
 A sellout crowd of 58,627 saw the NL champions receive their rings before the 
game and reserved its loudest ovation for Kruk. He rewarded the rooters with an 
RBI double in his first at-bat and went three for five with two runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that pregame ceremony they had pumped us up, seeing them get those 
rings," said Bichette, who also doubled twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Bichette has homered in all but one of the Rockies' six games. He is 13 for 26 
and is tied for the major-league lead in homers with Toronto's Carlos Delgado 
with five. Bichette has 11 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillies reliever Roger Mason (1-1) struck out Roberto Mejia with the bases 
loaded to end the seventh, preserving a 7-6 lead. He retired the first two 
batters in the eighth, then walked Joe Girardi and gave up Bichette's home run.

 Dealer Inventory Falls in March: U.S. inventories of domestically made 
vehicles from General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. declined 
to a 58-day supply in late March from 62 days as of Feb. 28, according to 
Ward's Automotive Reports. The Big Three auto makers are straining to get 
enough vehicles on dealer lots to meet increased demand, especially in the 
light-truck category.

 BROKEN HIGHWAYS: We're all delighted that the Santa Monica Freeway reopened 
Monday night, way ahead of schedule. But how about our own still-ailing 
freeways in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys? Is there some kind of 
favoritism being bestowed on roadways over the hill? No way, say Caltrans 
officials, who point out that some of the Valley freeway bridges are as tall as 
85 feet, making them far more difficult to rebuild.(A20) 
</P>
<P>
 CURE: Some doctors can make big bucks by taking on big cases. But with 
health-care reform around the corner, it makes perfect sense these days for 
Valley physicians to form medical groups with a better chance of drawing more 
patients. . . . "To practice in the 1990s," said one pediatrician, "you have to 
be willing to adapt." See Valley Business, Page 10. 
</P>
<P>
 PLAYING IT SAFE: Speaking of adapting, it's time for 20th Century in Woodland 
Hills to change its strategy as well. After all, the company still has an 
earthquake to pay for. . . . Facing $325 million in quake claims, 20th Century 
is expected to seek clients in Northern California and San Diego to spread its 
risk over a wider geographic area. See Valley Business, Page 3. Michael Arkush

SHUTTLE RADAR SCANS SAHARA FOR SIGNS OF LOST CIVILIZATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most advanced radar ever sent into space by NASA peered beneath the sand 
of the Sahara Desert on Monday for traces of ancient river channels and lost 
civilizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days into the 10-day flight, the radar aboard space shuttle Endeavour had 
mapped about 3 million square miles of Earth's surface, an area equivalent to 
half the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 After some initial difficulty, the $366-million worth of radar equipment is 
providing unprecedented three-dimensional maps of deserts, mountains, oceans, 
rivers and cropland. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists hope these images will help them better understand environmental 
changes and provide the world's policy-makers with ways to preserve Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the future. There is also the past: Archeologists and historians want 
to see radar images of the Sahara, Arabian and Chinese deserts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This area is of particular interest, not only for past climate change . . . 
but also the archeology aspect is extremely exciting," said project scientist 
Diane Evans, a geologist at Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous radar images and pictures from space led to the discovery in Oman of 
what is believed to be the lost city of Ubar, called "the Atlantis of the 
sands" by Lawrence of Arabia. Excavators believe the city was an ancient 
trading center for frankincense. 
</P>
<P>
 As Endeavour flew 138 miles over Algeria, the radar scanned the Central Sahara 
for ancient tributaries of the Niger River. One of the three radar wavelengths 
can penetrate as much as 10 feet beneath the surface.

MORNING BRIEFING: SUDDENLY, THE BULLPEN SEEMED LIKE A CAGE AWAITING THE LIONS

<P>
 Manager Johnny Oates of the Baltimore Orioles vividly recalls where he was 
when Henry Aaron hit his record 715th home run 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He was in the Atlanta Braves' bullpen, where the ball was caught by pitcher 
Tom House, 20 feet away from Oates.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were afraid people might come into the bullpen en masse ," Oates said. 
"People were practicing putting rope ladders down into the bullpen before the 
game. Fishing poles with nets on the end were dropped there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Oates: "Sammy Davis Jr. had offered $35,000 for the ball," Oates said. 
"House ran all the way in from the bullpen without stopping to give the ball to 
Aaron at the plate. He got an $800 TV for it." 
</P>
<P>
 So House theoretically lost $34,200 by not selling the ball to Davis. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Trivia time: Tom Lasorda ranks second among active managers in victories. Who 
is first?

 Paid in full: Bud Shaw in the Cleveland Plain Dealer on the Indians' new 
ballpark, Jacobs Field:  
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a nice symmetry to the relationship between the town and the 
fans because the team has driven people to drink for 40 years now, and the 
liquor tax was used to build the new stadium." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dream on: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on Michael Jordan's aspiring baseball career: 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael is trying to live his dream, and I respect him for it. I think it was 
F. Scott Fitzgerald who said the rich are not like the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, Michael's athletic skills are not like the rest of us. He can do things 
we can't even think about." 
</P>
<P>

</P>

 Was it imported? Eamonn Coghlan reportedly received a $100,000 bonus from a 
shoe company for the first sub-four-minute mile by an athlete 40 or over, in 
3:58.15, according to Track & Field News. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, when New Zealand's John Walker became the first under 3:50 with 
his world record of 3:49.4 in 1975, the story goes that Walker received $600 
under the table -- and a case of beer.

 Preference: John Stiegerwald in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette:

 "The fact that more Americans would rather watch bowling than hockey says a 
lot more about Americans than it does about hockey."

 Attitude adjustment: Payne Stewart, the 1991 U.S. Open champion, after missing 
the cut at the Masters with two 78s: 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a bad attitude right now. And that's much worse than a bad golf swing. 
I've had it for some time. I may not play anywhere for a while. I won't play 
again until it's fun."

endure more muggings. His anger erupted last Tuesday, when he charged referee 
Kerry Fraser, and Saturday, when he punched Montreal defenseman Mathieu 
Schneider after Schneider had cross-checked him on the back of the neck and 
wasn't sent off. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Gretzky, who experiences similar manhandling, understands Lemieux's ire. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a few guys who are going to get checked closer than others, and 
Mario is one of them," Gretzky said. "Sergei Fedorov (of Detroit) is another. . 
. . Some nights it gets frustrating. Some nights it's not fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Question 1: Do superstars deserve special treatment? 
</P>
<P>
 Question 2: Are restraining fouls punished often enough, especially 
considering that the NHL issued a directive reminding players and officials of 
cases when boarding, holding and interference must be called? 
</P>
<P>
 Question 3: Does Lemieux complain too much? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obvious the last couple of years that it's been pretty bad with the 
clutching and grabbing," said Lemieux, who was fined $500 for leaving the 
penalty box to get at Fraser. "That's why you have guys who can score only 50 
goals now. Before, you had guys who could score 70, 80, 90 goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gretzky: "They're trying (to call games closer), but a guy as good as 
Mario is going to get hooked endlessly. You can't call every one. . . . I think 
the refs do the best they can and I think all the players understand that." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Montreal Coach Jacques Demers said Schneider should have been 
penalized for cross-checking Lemieux, many general managers call Lemieux a 
crybaby -- wishing all the while that he was their crybaby. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mario should stop whining and play," Oiler General Manager Glen Sather told 
the Edmonton Journal. "He does get hooked and held, but so does Wayne, and 
Wayne's not nearly as strong as Mario." 
</P>
<P>
 Boston's Harry Sinden called Lemieux's behavior "intolerable," and added, "Cam 
Neely is out for the year (with a knee injury) and you don't hear him whining." 
</P>
<P>
 Fans pay to see Lemieux, Brett Hull, Gretzky and Fedorov, not the fourth-line 
centers who maul them. That's not to say a borderline infraction should be 
whistled if done to a star and ignored if done to others. If Lemieux is pushed 
off the puck, too bad. But if he's got opponents draped all over him and no 
call is made, that's punishing him for being talented and depriving fans of his 
gifts. Parity is a noble idea, but it should be achieved by increasing the 
skills of lesser teams, not by dragging down better players. SLIPPING PENGUINS 
</P>
<P>
 Back problems have marred Lemieux's season, but he's playing regularly to 
build stamina for the playoffs. Penguin General Manager Craig Patrick, who 
wrote off Lemieux's retirement threat as momentary frustration, is encouraged 
by his progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's doing well with his back," Patrick said. "The big thing is for him to 
get his skating legs. The players have adjusted to (his absences). We love 
having him in there, but we play a different game when he's not in. Everyone 
has to be a little more attentive defensively." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick is concerned about his defense, depleted when he traded Marty McSorley 
and Jim Paek to the Kings and couldn't replace them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got mobility now, but I'm not totally happy," he said. "I'm scared. The 
playoffs always scare me." WHERE THE ACTION IS 
</P>
<P>
 Is California the hockey capital of the NHL? The San Jose Sharks, Mighty Ducks 
and Kings have filled a greater percentage of their seats than the three New 
York-area teams, even though the Ducks and Kings didn't make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Including sellouts Monday and Wednesday, the Ducks have sold out 27 times and 
will have played to 98.9% capacity at the 17,174-seat Pond of Anaheim. The 
Kings, despite a box-office drop-off after they were eliminated from the 
playoffs, still sold 98% of their seats and have sold out 31 of 39 games at the 
16,005-seat Forum. The Sharks, with one game left, have had 27 sellouts and 
have filled 96.5% of the 17,190 seats at the new San Jose Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers have filled 98.9% of Madison Square Garden's seats, but the 
Islanders played to only 74.8% at the Nassau Coliseum and the New Jersey Devils 
have played to 74.7% at the Meadowlands, with one home game left. 
SHARK-INFESTED PLAYOFFS 
</P>
<P>
 When defenseman Jeff Norton learned last summer that he had been traded by the 
Islanders -- playoff semifinalists last spring -- to the Sharks, who had won 
only 11 games, he was more than a little dismayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Geez. That's going to be tough to go through,' " he said. "But after 
that, (the Sharks) made some moves and acquisitions and I saw they were making 
a commitment to winning." 
</P>
<P>
 The moves weren't costly. Todd Elik and Igor Larionov were claimed on waivers, 
Norton and defensive forward Gaetan Duchesne were acquired for draft picks and 
Bob Errey was signed as a free agent, and they clicked with the team's young 
talent. Right wing Ulf Dahlen, acquired from Dallas on March 19, was the 
catalyst in a streak that clinched San Jose's playoff berth. SLAP SHOTS 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers, who won their second President's Trophy for the point title in 
three years, say they won't make an early playoff exit as they did in 1992. "I 
have faith in (Coach) Mike Keenan," General Manager Neil Smith said. "I'd go to 
war with him." . . . The NHL loses a classy player -- and the last jewel in the 
Triple Crown line -- with today's retirement of King right wing Dave Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Manon Rheaume, the first woman to play a professional hockey game, and Erin 
Whitten, the first female goalie to win a minor league game, are competing in 
the Women's World Championship this week at Lake Placid, N.Y. Rheaume, who 
played for Tampa Bay in a 1992 exhibition, is on Team Canada. Whitten, who 
plays for Dallas of the Central Hockey League, is on Team USA. . . . For the 
record: The Rangers have been in the NHL for 68 years, not 58, as reported here 
last week.

NBA ROUNDUP; MAGIC BOMBS AWAY TO BEAT KNICKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While Shaquille O'Neal, Patrick Ewing and Charles Oakley hammered each other 
under the basket, Orlando's artillery brigade won the battle of three-pointers 
Monday night at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Magic made 11 of their 24 long-range shots and the Knicks nine of 23 as 
the two teams set an NBA record with 47 three-point attempts in Orlando's 
108-100 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Anderson scored 23 of his season-high 36 points in the second half and 
made six three-pointers as the Magic broke New York's nine-game home winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been playing well together," Anderson said of his team's four-game 
winning streak that has kept the Knicks from clinching the Atlantic Division 
and has virtually sewed up home-court advantage in the first round of their 
first playoff appearance. "There's no better time than right now to get your 
game together." 
</P>
<P>
 And no worse time for it to be falling apart. Ewing had 22 points and 18 
rebounds and Oakley 16 points and a season-high 22 rebounds for the Knicks, who 
have lost three in a row and four of five after winning 15 consecutive games to 
tie the NBA season-high. 
</P>
<P>
 Did they peak too early? 
</P>
<P>
 "Our streak is history," Knick Coach Pat Riley said. "It seems like a year 
ago, but if we hadn't won 15 in a row, we would be three or four games down to 
Atlanta." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Knicks and Hawks have identical records with seven games 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte 99, Miami 97 -- Dell Curry scored 21 points, including 14 in a row 
in Charlotte's key second-half rally, to lead the Hornets to a victory at home. 
</P>
<P>
 It was their fourth in a row in their quest to catch a playoff berth, but they 
remain 3 1/2 games behind the eighth-place team, Miami, which needs only one 
more victory to secure a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Curry went nine for 16, including three for seven from three-point range, and 
led Charlotte back from a 74-62 deficit with 2:38 to play in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 101, Minnesota 89 -- David Robinson scored 29 points and Willie 
Anderson added 23 to lead the Spurs at San Antonio as they ended a three-game 
losing steak. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio moved within two games of Houston in the Midwest Division race, 
but the Spurs have only six games remaining and the Rockets have eight. 
</P>
<P>
 J.R. Reid, starting in place in the injured Dale Ellis, added 14 points for 
San Antonio, and Sleepy Floyd had 11. Dennis Rodman grabbed 15 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 121, Boston 108 -- Rik Smits scored a season-high 32 points and caused 
two centers to foul out as the Pacers won at Indianapolis to sweep a season 
series against Boston for the first time since they joined the NBA in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacers shot 58%, outscored Boston, 37-16, from the free throw line and 
used an 8-0 run at the start of the fourth quarter to pull away. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State 122, Dallas 108 -- Latrell Sprewell scored 33 points to lead 
seven players in double figures as the Warriors won at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Webber scored 13 points and Billy Owens and Chris Gatling added 12 
apiece for Golden State, which beat Dallas for the 14th time in a row.

SACRAMENTO EVEN IN STANDINGS; PRO BASKETBALL: THE KINGS MOVE INTO A TIE WITH 
THE CLIPPERS BY DEFEATING THEM, 118-97. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 When you're playing out the string and the best you can hope for is to escape 
last place in your division, it's tough to get motivated . . . unless you play 
for the Kings, who have been last so long, the opportunity to be anything else 
is motivation enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento got 26 points from Wayman Tisdale and 18 rebounds from Olden 
Polynice in a 118-97 victory over the Clippers at Arco Arena on Monday that 
brought the two clubs into a tie for sixth in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Not much, but it spurred Sacramento to its second victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers lost their 11th in the last 14 games. The playoffs are a distant 
memory after two years of postseason play, and escaping the cellar might not be 
enough to get them excited about playing the Seattle SuperSonics tonight at the 
Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento broke the game open in the first quarter, opening up a 13-point 
lead that it stretched to 20 by halftime. The Kings dominated the backboards, 
outrebounding the Clippers, 60-46, with 23 on the offensive end. Tisdale had 13 
and Trevor Wilson 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Loy Vaught had 21 points and Ron Harper 19 for the Clippers, who were missing 
starters Dominique Wilkins (sore back), Mark Jackson (sore right wrist) and 
Elmore Spencer, who left the game with a strained right arch in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento, led by Tisdale's 14 points, dominated the first half and led by as 
much as 23, shooting 52% and holding the Clippers to 34% for a 65-45 lead at 
intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitch Richmond scored 12 of his 23 points in the first quarter when the Kings 
outscored the Clippers, 22-10, over the last 7:02. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers lost to the Kings for only the second time in five meetings this 
year.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It happened on opening day at Anaheim Stadium: 
</P>
<P>
 10:30 a.m. -- The standings reveal that the Angels are the only major pro team 
in Southern California with a winning record. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 10:32 -- "It's important for a young club to get off to a good start," says 
Buck Rodgers, aware that the young Angels were 13-5 last year before fading to 
71-91. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 10:40 -- Already, it is warm in Orange County. The predicted high for today in 
Cleveland is 51. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 10:50 -- Mark Langston, 33, who is on the disabled list, and Jimmie Reese, 92, 
who isn't, stroll into the Angel dugout together. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 10:53 -- Rodgers on watching Bo Jackson run: "It's like a Mack truck with a 
tire wobbling." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 10:55 -- Something is missing atop the seats in the left field upper deck. 
It's the scoreboard that was wrecked by the earthquake and won't be rebuilt 
until August. There is a temporary replacement board on the lower level. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 11 -- The Angels can't complain about their digs at the Big A, where the home 
team clubhouse has been tastefully redecorated. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 11:10 -- KMPC announcer Bob Starr prepares his pregame notes. His 25th year 
doing baseball will be special. "I damn near died," says Starr, who contracted 
Legionnaire's disease last year. "I'm grateful to be here." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 11:20 -- Angel executive Bob Harrison, who scouted Brian Anderson in college, 
says, "He's got more confidence than any five guys should have." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 11:25 -- Dugout visitor Wayne Gretzky says the NHL tournament is wide open, 
but predicts the New York Rangers will win their first Stanley Cup since 1940. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 12:45 p.m. -- There are plenty of empty seats, which isn't unusual for Angel 
home openers. Only twice have they attracted as many as 40,000. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 12:56 -- Bo Jackson receives the loudest ovation during introductions, edging 
Tim Salmon, Mark Langston, Chuck Finley and Brian Anderson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Gretzky tosses out the first ball. It's high and outside. But he's 
playing hurt, suffering from a knee injury that will keep him out of the Kings' 
final two games. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 1:20 -- Dwight Smith increases his batting average to .500 with a double to 
left-center field in the first inning. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 1:23 -- Designated hitter Chili Davis strikes out with a runner on third and 
two out. I still like the DH rule. I would rather see Davis strike out with 
gusto in the cleanup spot than pitcher John Dopson strike out meekly in the 
ninth spot. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 1:46 -- Center fielder Chad Curtis robs Sandy Alomar Jr. of a hit with a 
diving catch. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 1:48 -- The Angels, who committed only two errors in their first six games, 
continue to field well as second baseman Harold Reynolds makes a charging stop 
of Jim Thome's grounder. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 1:50 -- Players on both teams are wearing patches on the right sleeve to 
commemorate the 125th anniversary of professional baseball. Next year, they 
probably will wear 126th anniversary patches. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 2:11 -- So much for that great California defense. Shortstop Gary DiSarcina, 
fighting the sun, drops Albert Belle's pop fly for a two-base error and the 
Indians lead by 1-0 in the fourth. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 2:24 -- Alomar takes Dopson deep into the left field seats. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 2:29 -- Manny Ramirez takes Dopson even deeper. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 2:49 -- Reliever Bob Patterson limits Paul Sorrento to a two-run double as 
Cleveland pulls away, 6-0, in the sixth. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 2:54 -- In an early bid for rookie-of-the-year honors, Ramirez hits his second 
homer and drives in his fifth run in two innings to make it 9-0. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 2:55 -- Patterson delivers some chin music to Kenny Lofton, who threatens to 
charge the mound and then decides to walk to first base instead. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 3:15 -- "We Want Bo! We Want Bo!" chant the fans. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 3:19 -- Davis gets the Angels on the board and doubles their hit production 
off Mark Clark with a homer in the seventh. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 4:11 -- Reynolds comes to bat in the ninth. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 4:15 -- On Eric Plunk's 12th pitch to him, Reynolds hits a bases-loaded single 
off first baseman Sorrento's glove to keep the rally alive. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 4:17 -- DiSarcina gets the Angels' fourth single of the inning to close the 
gap to 9-6 and bring the tying run to the plate. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 4:24 -- Thousands of motorists listening to the radio wish they hadn't left 
early. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 4:25 -- The crowd gets Bo Jackson, but reliever Steve Farr gets him to strike 
out on a 3-and-2 pitch to end the game.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; IT WAS A BELL-RINGING PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By BOB NIGHTENGALE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bo Jackson took the cellular telephone out of his briefcase Sunday afternoon, 
while the team was on the way to the Milwaukee airport, and asked Brian 
Anderson for his mom's telephone number. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. A, I just want to let you know your son pitched a great ballgame today," 
Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Replied Janice Anderson: "Who is this? 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Bo Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh-uh." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, it is." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, it's not. Really, who is this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson finally shrugged, handed the phone to Anderson and let him tell her. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, was so impressed by Anderson's first major league victory Sunday that 
he told him he could talk to his mother as long as he wanted.  
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Hey, you pitched such a good game, you're sitting with me on the 
team bus and plane,' " Jackson said. "That was something else." 
</P>
<P>
 The Andersons were able to watch their son's performance via a satellite dish 
and spent most of the day Monday answering the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just beside ourselves," Janice Anderson said. "And to think, I talked 
to Bo Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The player most noticeably absent from the home-opener Monday was first 
baseman J.T. Snow, who currently plays at Vancouver, and probably has played 
his last game in an Angel uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring an injury to Eduardo Perez, the new starter at first, Snow will remain 
at triple-A Vancouver until he is traded, Angel Manager Buck Rodgers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cleveland Indians expressed interest in Snow during spring training, after 
the Angels had abruptly pulled out of negotiations with the New York Mets for 
Anthony Young, but now appear content with Paul Sorrento. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As much as the Kings' Wayne Gretzky loves baseball, he says Michael Jordan can 
have his fun, but that Gretzky will be finished with sports when his hockey 
career ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine trying to hit a Mark Langston," Gretzky said. "That's 
something I would not look forward to." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angel left-hander Joe Magrane, who expects to rejoin the rotation by the first 
week of May, apparently was gone longer than he thought. 
</P>
<P>
 He arrived to the clubhouse to find the nameplate over his locker spelled, 
'McGrane." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was wondering who the new guy was," Magrane said. BOB NIGHTENGALE

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; CHRIS GWYNN IS HAPPY TO RETURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He had been one of the many talented players the Dodgers had no spot for, but 
Chris Gwynn, who was traded away after the 1991 season, is back now, and gives 
the Dodgers another option in left field. 
</P>
<P>
 Gwynn, 29, who was released by the Kansas City Royals about two weeks ago, 
said he still doesn't understand why it didn't work out there. "The last two 
weeks have been different," Gwynn said. "I thought I had a good season (in 
1993), in fact, I know I did, but I guess it just didn't matter. They got some 
new guys, Vince Coleman and Dave Henderson, but still, I was one of the better 
players. But there is one thing I know, that just because I didn't make that 
team doesn't mean I can't make another one." 
</P>
<P>
 Gwynn was born in Los Angeles and grew up in Long Beach, and with his brother, 
Tony, in San Diego, he is glad to be back. The Dodgers said they signed him for 
left-handed punch off the bench, but there is a left field job open for the 
taking, with Henry Rodriguez and Billy Ashley having the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Dodgers) haven't said anything to me," Gwynn said. "But I just want to 
get ready to play, and the rest will take care of itself." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Ashley said a meeting he had with Manager Tom Lasorda during spring training 
has helped his performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm seeing the ball better and I shortened up my swing a little bit," Ashley 
said. "Tommy sat me down and told me that if I wanted to make it to the big 
leagues, I would have to shorten my swing, and that was enough motivation for 
me to change it. I always have known that I have a long swing, and the fact 
that I was successful with it in Albuquerque and in double A was the level of 
pitching. In the majors, they are going to pitch me to that weakness." 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley batted .297 with 26 home runs and 100 runs batted in in Albuquerque, 
but he also struck out 143 times. Since taking Strawberry's place on the 
roster, he is two for six with a double and has struck out twice. He and 
Rodriguez -- a left-handed batter -- are platooning in left field. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that impressed me about Ashley was when we sent him to Albuquerque 
to start the season, he had such a great attitude," said Fred Claire, executive 
vice president. "It's as if he now knows that he's a good player, he has the 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 At home in Los Angeles, the players can wear what they want to the clubhouse, 
but on the road, jeans are not allowed. So when Darren Dreifort showed up in 
jeans to go to a St. Louis mall with Orel Hershiser, he was told the rules. "I 
knew you couldn't wear jeans on the plane or to the clubhouse, but I didn't 
know about the rest of the time," Dreifort said.  
</P>
<P>
 And when Delino DeShields showed up Monday at the clubhouse at Busch Stadium 
dressed in jeans and a jean jacket, he heard about it from Lasorda. "This is 
what we wore in Montreal," DeShields said. "Oh, well, guess I better go buy 
some slacks." MARYANN HUDSON

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; CUBS CLOSE MET OPENER BY TURNING THE TABLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mets opened in Chicago with a three-game sweep last week and came home 
Monday for their Shea Stadium opener ready to begin another against the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Buechele made certain that wouldn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
 He drove in four runs with a double and homer as Chicago returned the favor, 
ruining New York's home opener with a 9-5 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Buechele doubled home Chicago's first run in the second inning against Bobby 
Jones (1-1) and then hit a three-run homer off Dave Telgheder to highlight a 
six-run third. 
</P>
<P>
 Both times, he took advantage when the Met pitchers fell behind on the count. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the double and the homer, the count was in my favor," Buechele said. "Both 
pitchers got the ball over the middle of the plate. As a hitter, you've got to 
take advantage of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Willie Banks (1-1), beaten by the Mets in their three-game sweep last week in 
Chicago, earned his first National League victory, allowing six hits in six 
innings. Banks, who pitched for Minnesota last year, struck out five and walked 
four. 
</P>
<P>
 He was helped by a feeling of nervousness by young Mets playing at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their actions were a little faster than usual," New York Manager Dallas Green 
said. "They were trying to do things because it was the first game back home, 
not because it was a baseball game. We're still learning how to handle the 
major leagues and how to handle playing in New York." 
</P>
<P>
 Youth kept the Mets coming. They loaded the bases in the ninth inning against 
relievers Dan Plesac and Randy Myers before David Segui, who had three hits, 
struck out to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 8, Philadelphia 7 -- On a day the fans cheered loud and long for John 
Kruk, Dante Bichette silenced them with one swing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bichette hit his fifth homer of the season, a two-run shot in the eighth 
inning that gave the Rockies a victory and spoiled the Phillies' home opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Kruk, activated only six hours after undergoing radiation treatment for 
testicular cancer, got three hits and came up with the tying run on second in 
the ninth inning with one out, but looked at strike three. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 9, Montreal 4 -- Thomas Howard hit a go-ahead single in the 
five-run 11th inning as the Reds extended their winning streak to five games, 
winning at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacob Brumfield doubled with one out in the 11th off Gil Heredia (0-1) but was 
trapped off second base. Brumfield advanced when shortstop Mike Lansing made a 
bad relay to third baseman Sean Berry for an error. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard singled and scored on Lenny Harris' double for a 6-4 lead. Jeff Branson 
hit a run-scoring single and Brian Dorsett hit a two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Hector Carrasco (3-0) pitched two innings of relief to win for the 
Reds.

PAEZ DEFEATS ACEVES BY A UNANIMOUS DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jorge Paez of Mexicali, Mexico, a former circus clown, spends as much time 
working on his flashy dance steps as pop diva Janet Jackson, who recently 
finished a three-night stand at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Paez, who is known for his antics, treated a Monday night fight crowd of 4,568 
at the Forum to quite a show before his 10-round lightweight bout against 
Mauricio Aceves of Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 Paez entered the ring wearing a white cowboy hat, garish shorts with 
multicolored spots and purple shoes with tassels. His shorts bore the name of a 
car dealer, and he had the name of a clothing company shaved into the back of 
his hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Paez, who danced his way through the first round, quickly got serious long 
enough to score a unanimous decision over Aceves. Judges Dick Young and Pat 
Russell scored it 97-92 for Paez, while Larry Rozadillo scored it 98-91 for 
Paez, who had a point deducted for clowning in the 10th round by referee Larry 
Moret. 
</P>
<P>
 "The referee kept warning me and warning me," Paez said through an 
interpreter. "The referee is crazy. They know how I fight, why does he do that 
(penalize Paez a point)?" 
</P>
<P>
 Paez, a former International Boxing Federation featherweight champion, did 
several back flips after the decision was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 If Paez, 50-6-4 with 34 knockouts, wins his next fight, he is expected to 
fight Oscar De La Hoya for the World Boxing Organization's 130-pound title or 
the WBO lightweight title. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's my friend, but I'm not impressed by anyone except my mother," Paez said 
of De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
 Paez is confident that he can beat De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm Robo Cop," Paez said. "Now that I train, I can win practically every 
round. With De La Hoya, I'll go straight ahead, I won't be taking a step back."

L.A. UNIVERSITY BEAT / WENDY WITHERSPOON; TENNIS HURT BY EXPENSES RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 College tennis is in quite a fix. 
</P>
<P>
 An article in last November's issue of Tennis magazine claimed that whenever 
Miami's Bertrand Madsen needed money, he simply went to France and played in a 
couple of tournaments, raking in as much as $7,000 in "expense money" in three 
weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 That is an apparent violation of an NCAA rule governing amateurism. 
</P>
<P>
 The article was brought to the attention of Miami's compliance officer, Craig 
Angelos, who reported the violation to the NCAA, adding that he believed the 
problem was widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the NCAA asked schools across the nation to investigate their 
players and determine the manner in which they have received money while 
playing in professional tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the cases are not as severe as Madsen's. He received $29,000 in 
expense money in professional tournaments the last three years and lost his 
college eligibility because of it. Still, countless players across the country 
have been declared temporarily ineligible by their schools in the last week, 
most having had to sit out two matches. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the controversy are conflicting rules, one by the NCAA, the 
other by the United States Tennis Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA rule says, in essence, that players cannot receive more expense money 
than they would receive as prize money for a first-round loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The USTA says amateur players can receive expense money for as many rounds as 
they stay alive in a professional tournament, as long as the money is 
documented. 
</P>
<P>
 Many players, using the USTA rule, took expense money as they advanced through 
professional tournaments.  
</P>
<P>
 So why didn't the schools' compliance officers, whose job it is to know the 
NCAA rules, ever realize what was going on?  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it was a question of people not knowing about the NCAA rule," 
said Judith Holland, UCLA associate athletic director. "(Administrators) didn't 
know that tennis tournaments were being run in that fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 But coaches knew, and they ignored it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody did," said Bill Zaima, UCLA women's tennis coach. "It has always 
been an issue that I think a lot of people were wondering when it was going to 
come up." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dick Leach, USC men's coach: "Since no one said anything, they just 
didn't worry about it." 
</P>
<P>
 But sweeping it under the rug didn't make it go away, and now college tennis 
is dealing with a monster. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-ranked USC men's team, which declared four players ineligible last 
week, had to default against UCLA last Friday. It also will default against UC 
San Diego today. The players -- Wayne Black, Jon Leach, Lukas Hovorka and Brett 
Hansen -- are expected to have their eligibility restored in time for Friday's 
match against Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Two players on the 15th-ranked USC women's team also are being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 At UCLA, two members of the 12th-ranked men's team, Robert Janecek and 
Sebastien LeBlanc, were declared ineligible last week for two matches. All six 
starters on the eighth-ranked UCLA women's team are being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Zapolski, Pepperdine's sports information director, said Pepperdine 
has not received any letters of inquiry from the NCAA concerning any of the 
school's tennis players. 
</P>
<P>
 But for those who are affected, the problem could not have come at a worse 
time -- heading into the NCAA tournaments next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA men's team, for instance, was a marginal candidate to receive one of 
eight automatic berths to the NCAA men's tournament at Notre Dame in late May. 
A legitimate victory over USC would have helped the Bruins' chances. The NCAA 
might not look kindly upon UCLA's default victory over USC.  
</P>
<P>
 In that case, UCLA would have to play in the West Regional qualifying 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 And no matter how the problem is ultimately resolved -- many coaches are 
calling for the NCAA rule to be changed -- any records set this season probably 
will have asterisks next to them. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation leaves many questions. Among the most disturbing: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Considering the implications of declaring so many players ineligible, why 
didn't the NCAA form a plan of action before beginning its inquiry? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why is the NCAA leaving it up to the individual schools to investigate this 
problem when the schools have covered it up for so long? 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 After winning the NCAA West Regional tournament at Boise State on Saturday, 
the UCLA women's gymnastics team heads into the NCAA meet April 21-23 at Utah. 
. . . The UCLA men's gymnastics team placed fourth at the NCAA West Regional at 
Colorado Springs on Saturday, failing to advance to the NCAA team championships 
at Nebraska April 22-23. Six men did qualify to compete as individuals. . . . 
UCLA will play host to the Pacific 10 Conference women's golf tournament April 
25-27 at the Brentwood Country Club.

JUDGE ORDERS STRATTON OUT OF AUDITOR'S RACE; CAMPAIGN: SIMI MAYOR WILL APPEAL 
RULING THAT HE IS UNQUALIFIED BECAUSE HIS DEGREE ISN'T FROM ACCOUNTING SCHOOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton lacks the credentials required by state law to 
be a candidate for county auditor, a Superior Court judge ruled Monday as he 
ordered Stratton's name stricken from the June primary ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge William L. Peck ruled that Stratton's master's degree in business 
administration from Cal Lutheran University does not qualify him for the job 
because it was not earned at an accounting school. 
</P>
<P>
 Peck gave Stratton until 5 p.m. today to appeal the decision to the 2nd 
District Court of Appeal in Ventura, and Stratton said he would challenge 
Peck's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The vow to appeal delayed the county's plan to begin printing sample ballots 
Monday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's hearing resulted from a lawsuit to disqualify Stratton filed by 
William Baker, a certified public accountant and one of five other candidates 
for the auditor-controller's post. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy with the outcome," Baker said outside the courtroom. "I think 
it brings to light the fact that he has a very light accountancy background." 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for county auditor, a candidate must either be a certified public 
accountant, have served as county auditor-controller or deputy 
auditor-controller for at least three years, or possess a certificate or 
diploma from a school of accountancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there are no schools of accountancy in California, Stratton said he 
believes his master's degree in business administration -- including 14 units 
in accounting -- qualifies him for the position. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton, who supervises the software department at Teledyne Systems in 
Chatsworth, expressed disappointment in the judge's ruling but said he is 
confident he will prevail on appeal. "The judge took a very narrow view of the 
law," the Simi Valley mayor said. "He did rule my degree was equivalent, but he 
said equivalency wasn't good enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton's attorney, Robert O. Huber of Simi Valley, said he still believes 
the state elections law allows candidates with his client's educational 
background to seek the auditor-controller's job. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he wishes Peck "would have erred on the side of democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Elections officials, who urged Peck to give a definitive ruling Monday, were 
frustrated by the delay the appeal promises to cause. A lawyer representing the 
county said officials needed to start printing sample ballots by Monday to meet 
a state-mandated deadline for mailing samples to voters. 
</P>
<P>
 For the June 7 election, voting officials are required by law to mail sample 
ballots to the county's 350,000 voters between April 28 and May 16, according 
to court papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, election authorities will have to put their printing on hold until after 
the issue is resolved, said Robert R. Orellana, assistant county counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our position was that we needed the decision, but we will not get it today," 
Orellana said. "The printers' deadline is today. That's why we asked the court 
to make a ruling today." 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates for auditor-controller include incumbent Thomas O. Mahon, who 
was appointed by the Board of Supervisors last year after serving 20 years as 
assistant controller. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased," Mahon said of the decision. "It eliminates a strong candidate. 
But I know Greg Stratton must be disappointed. He has put a lot into this. It 
benefits me, but I feel sorry for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates are accountants Scott Weiss of Ventura, Richard Morrisset of 
Ventura and Clifford Wigen of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss said he had hoped to have the issue resolved Monday. "But I think the 
court made the right decision in that Stratton is not qualified," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Rowley, Baker's attorney, called Peck's decision appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wants to have a second opinion," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he's qualified," she said of Stratton. "That's not to say he 
wouldn't make a great auditor-controller." 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton said the issue should be resolved in a civil trial after the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (appeal) court, we hope, will understand that this is the wrong time to 
have that trial," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he did not think Baker's suit would be successful.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were aware that this was an issue," Stratton said. "But I guess we just 
never expected a very narrow interpretation of the law." 
</P>
<P>
 His attorney, Huber, added: "I'm very hopeful we will have an appellate court 
overturn this."

HELMET LAW MAKES HEADWAY WITH YOUNG BIKE RIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five times a week, 14-year-old Armando Enriquez rides a bike from his 
intermediate school in Oxnard with a black helmet dangling uselessly from the 
handlebars. 
</P>
<P>
 And five times a week, Armando waits until he is one block away from school 
before he dares to strap on his protective headgear. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other kids will make fun of me, so I wait to put it on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 About three months have passed since a state law requiring child bicycle 
riders to wear helmets went into effect, and police and school administrators 
say many young riders are complying, albeit reluctantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the kids I see are wearing the helmets," said Simi Valley Police Lt. 
Tony Harper. "And most of the parents are being responsible in purchasing the 
helmets." 
</P>
<P>
 The law applies to bicycle riders under age 18, and violators will receive 
only warnings from police during a one-year grace period. But beginning in 
1995, those cited will be subject to fines of up to $25 per offense. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Police and Ventura County sheriff's deputies say they have not given many 
warnings so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of the kids are complying," said Ventura Police Sgt. George 
Morris. "If they're not wearing a helmet, you just pull up next to a kid, have 
a little conversation and try to reinforce the importance of compliance." 
</P>
<P>
 At Los Cerritos Intermediate School in Thousand Oaks, Principal JoAnn Yoos 
said she has seen fewer bare-headed riders since January. The holdouts are not 
donning helmets because they know they won't receive citations yet, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once those tickets get issued, you would get a lot more compliance," Yoos 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers are very self-conscious of their looks and image, Yoos said, and 
many resist wearing helmets because they're afraid they'll look nerdy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell them, 'You're not being a geek, you're being smart,' " Yoos said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Jucker, 12, of Oxnard, said she feels self-conscious when she wears 
her helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear all those people say, 'Ooh, she's a geek,' " Stephanie said. "It's 
embarrassing, so sometimes I don't wear a helmet." 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of the law say helmets will save lives and millions of dollars in 
medical bills. They say nearly 18,000 children were admitted to California 
emergency rooms in 1991 for bicycle-related head injuries. State figures 
indicate that 138 people died in hospitals that year from bike-related 
injuries, more than half of them children. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Nat Baumer, who heads the emergency room at Ventura County Medical Center, 
is enthusiastic about the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen dramatic instances of people coming in with their helmets severely 
traumatized," Baumer said. "The helmets are markedly deformed, and the patients 
have not had head injuries. They have broken arms, and broken clavicles, but no 
major head injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bicycle-shop owners are also happy with the law and report higher sales of 
children's bicycle helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Yepez, owner of the Bicycle Clinic in Oxnard, estimates that his sales of 
bike helmets for children have increased about 20% since January. Sales of 
adult bike helmets have increased 5%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the children are reluctant to wear helmets, but their parents force 
them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't like it because of the appearance," Yepez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme Police Sgt. Ted Snyder said most of the riders who wear helmets 
tend to be children in elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the biggest problem we'll have is the teen-age group," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Jurado, 14, of Oxnard, said he has two helmets at home but conveniently 
"forgets" wearing a helmet because he doesn't think it's good for his image. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad wants me to wear it because he's a cop, but it messes up my hair," he 
said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; BENEFIT GAME A WEAK DRAW BUT STILL SCORES

 Hampered by a disappointing turnout, the Ojai Valley's Make-A-Wish softball 
tournament last weekend raised about $2,000 -- several thousand less than 
expected -- for Ventura County children with life-threatening illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Tournament executive director Lenny Roberts said only seven teams participated 
in the event, about half of those expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had four weddings and a softball tournament up here," Roberts said. "Ojai 
is a small community. When something happens that distracts people, you pay the 
price." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Roberts said he is still pleased that Ojai Valley residents were 
able to contribute to the Tri-Counties Make-A-Wish Foundation. It was the sixth 
year the community had held the softball tournament, which has raised a total 
of $15,000 in the five previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 Gail Gower, executive director of the foundation that serves Ventura, Santa 
Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties, said the money will be used to help 
fulfill the wishes of about 20 ill children. 
</P>
<P>
 Most, she said, have asked to go to Disney World in Florida. TINA DAUNT

CAMARILLO WILL CHOOSE BETWEEN 2 SMOKING LAWS; HEALTH: ONE BANS LIGHTING UP IN 
PUBLIC PLACES EXCEPT FOR BARS AND TOBACCO SHOPS, THE OTHER PERMITS PUFFING IN 
LOCATIONS WITH THE PROPER FACILITIES. 
</P>

<P>
 Pressured by small-business owners, smokers' rights advocates and staunch 
anti-smokers alike, the Camarillo City Council is set to choose between two 
versions of a smoking ordinance at its meeting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is scheduled to choose between an ordinance that would permit 
smoking in most public places -- where there are completely separate no-smoking 
sections and which have separate ventilation systems -- and an ordinance that 
would effectively ban smoking in all public places except for bars and tobacco 
shops. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-smoking movement has been shepherded by City Councilwoman Charlotte 
Craven, who said Monday that she would like to see the more stringent of the 
two versions adopted by the council but would consider voting for the more 
permissive version in order to get an anti-smoking city law on the books. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at this like I always have -- it's a matter of public health," Craven 
said. "At the same time, I know that it takes three votes to get anything 
accomplished. I'm willing to listen to a compromise solution if necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 But according to Dorothy Walden, owner of Dorothy's Chuckwagon Cafe, either 
ordinance would hurt her business. 
</P>
<P>
 "My customers have told me that if (the council) passes a no-smoking 
ordinance, they won't be back," Walden said. "I don't think this is right and 
it stands to really hurt my business." 
</P>
<P>
 Walden said that she would prefer an ordinance that would effectively let 
business owners decide for themselves what kind of place to have: smoking or 
nonsmoking. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would decide based on what our customers are saying," Walden said. "Then 
we would place large signs in the window that would alert patrons as to what 
kind of place they were entering." 
</P>
<P>
 But the only way to assure nonsmokers that they will not be affected by 
secondhand smoke is by passing the tougher of the two proposed ordinances, said 
Bernard Firestone, a spokesman for Camarillo Voters for Health Coalition, a 
group that recently formed over the heated issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone, in a written statement, claimed that a majority of Camarillo 
residents do not smoke and would support the creation of a strong anti-smoking 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a health issue, not a business or political issue," Firestone said. 
"If our elected officials will not support this no-smoking ordinance, we will 
vote for those who will." 
</P>
<P>
 On March 9, the council opted to send the proposed ordinances back to its own 
legislative committee and to staff for further review. During that meeting, 
dozens of residents and merchants spoke out against the adoption of any smoking 
ordinance in the city, saying that such a law would unfairly violate their 
rights and personal freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Other speakers lauded the council for following in the footsteps of other 
Ventura County cities that have recently adopted no-smoking ordinances out of 
concern for nonsmokers. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo City Council will consider adoption of a smoking ordinance 
during its meeting Wednesday at City Hall at 601 Carmen Drive. The regular 
meeting starts at 5 p.m. but the anti-smoking ordinance will not be considered 
by the council until its 7:30 p.m. session.

DISHONORING THE DEAD; OXNARD: ALTHOUGH HISTORIC HUENEME MASONIC CEMETERY IS THE 
RESTING PLACE OF CITY LEADERS AND PIONEERS, THE SITE IS IN RUINS, LEFT TO 
VANDALS. THERE ARE NO RESOURCES TO RESTORE OR PROTECT IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It is a proud name in Oxnard history, a family that settled vast stretches of 
farmland and helped establish a thriving port. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, the Saviers headstone lies broken in a neglected cemetery, the 
granite obelisk covered with mud and littered with fragments of a Bud Lite 
bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the finest burial ground on the Oxnard Plain, the three-acre Hueneme 
Masonic Cemetery has become a ruined graveyard: its headstones broken and its 
plots covered with spongy ice plant and trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody is stopping the deterioration. The century-old site between Etting and 
Pleasant Valley roads is not a historical landmark. And even if it were, the 
distinction would protect it chiefly from development, not vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard code enforcement officials leave the maintenance of private cemeteries 
to the owners. And the people who bought the plots at the Masonic graveyard 
have long since died. 
</P>
<P>
 The corporation set up to maintain the cemetery, the Hueneme Masonic Cemetery 
Assn., uses its dwindling bank account to pay state taxes. With recent tax 
increases, that money could run out by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what the state is going to do then," said R. Blinn Maxwell, the 
Oxnard attorney who represents the association. "They can't condemn a 
cemetery." 
</P>
<P>
 The graveyard is actually older than Oxnard: Its first plots sold in 1898, 
five years before the city incorporated. In those days, farmers and merchants 
had to travel to Camarillo to bury their dead. Tired of the long journey, 
community leaders, including banker A. Levy, started their own cemetery. For 
the most part, it was up to families to maintain the plots they bought. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a landmark out here," recalled Robert Naumann, 82, who has lived next 
to the Masonic site for decades. The original owners gave a corner of the 
cemetery to Japanese workers for their own burial ground. At the center of the 
site were burial plots of city founders, farmers and pioneers who settled in 
the region. Naumann remembers attending a military funeral when he was a child. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A dirt road once ran down the center of the graveyard and a small well sat to 
the side. Bouquets of flowers once decorated the granite headstones, engraved 
with names such as Richard Cox and Permeliah Arnold. Now the only flowers there 
are the yellow blooms on the ice plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverage bottles and broken glass lie among the graves. Robert Naumann's son 
Frank has found even stranger things: candles, dead chickens and burned debris 
suggesting rituals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids have gotten in here in the last few years and started vandalizing the 
place," said Naumann, brushing the dirt off a fallen gravestone. "It'd be nice 
if they'd just leave it alone." 
</P>
<P>
 The city can do little to stop the destruction, said Oxnard City Councilman 
Michael A. Plisky. "How can you protect them?" he asked. "It's against the law 
to destroy private property. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps the best we can do is stake that place out, catch the kids and send 
them to Singapore," where vandalism is severely punished, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the cemetery's problem is merely old age, said Plisky, "I certainly 
don't think it's the city's responsibility to pay to keep it up." 
</P>
<P>
 John Coultas, a member of the Oxnard Masonic Lodge whose great-great-uncle is 
buried at the cemetery, would like his group to take on that responsibility. 
But he added: "There's no money left to take care of it. We kind of look after 
it, but there's no money left." 
</P>
<P>
 The cemetery lost its main source of revenue -- selling plots -- when larger 
cemeteries opened, offering perpetual-care plans. These were more costly but 
convenient because the plans provide for maintenance of the plots. No one has 
been buried at the Masonic site since at least 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 The corporation running it has about $5,000 left in its account, but with 
recent tax increases, must pay $800 a year to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell said Job's Daughters, a woman's auxiliary to the Masons, are 
considering whether to take on the project. In the meantime, the Naumanns next 
door do what they can to maintain the cemetery: planting trees along the edge 
of the site and putting in ice plant when the drought killed all other 
vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know who else would undertake it," Robert Naumann said. "These lots 
were sold in the 1900s. The people who originally bought them have either moved 
away or lost interest or died."

JUDGE REFUSES TO BAR NURSES FROM STRIKING; LABOR: BUT HE AFFIRMS ORDER 
REQUIRING NOTICE OF WALKOUT. HOSPITAL POLICY FORCING STAFF TO HAVE DOCTOR'S 
EXCUSE FOR SICK DAYS IS NULLIFIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge Monday rejected Ventura County's bid to block county 
nurses from striking, but kept in place a temporary order requiring at least 72 
hours notice of a walkout. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Ken W. Riley also freed nurses at Ventura County Medical Center from a 
morale-breaking new policy that forced them to bring in a private doctor's note 
after taking sick leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel the judge has upheld the professional integrity of nurses," said 
Judith Overmyer, co-chairwoman of the local chapter of the California Nurses 
Assn. "It was beyond me that you couldn't trust a nursing staff with a decision 
on whether they were sick." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's ruling represented the first victory in a string of disappointments 
for the county's nurses -- who have faced layoffs, pay cuts and failed contract 
negotiations in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the decision raised concerns for county officials, nervous that the health 
care workers will follow through on their threat to walk out. Union leaders 
voted three weeks ago to authorize a strike, but say they will use the labor 
action only as a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly the county has been examining the steps necessary to protect public 
health," said Ed McLean, assistant personnel director for the county.  
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of a strike escalated last week after the county Board of 
Supervisors imposed a pay and benefits package on 350 health care workers at 
the county hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now perhaps, there's a greater motivation for some type of work action," said 
Assistant County Counsel Leroy Smith, arguing in court for an injunction 
against a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the nurses' union will ask the court to block the county's plans to 
impose the contract and any possible layoffs. Short of that, union leaders say 
Monday's ruling allows them to keep the option of a strike -- and the leverage 
to bring the county back into contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There are, at this time, no plans to strike or engage in any work stoppage," 
Donald Nielsen, attorney for the nurses' union, told the judge. "They want the 
county to come back to the bargaining table, so we can settle this matter once 
and for all." 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with the decision of imposing a strike ban or dismissing a temporary 
order setting the 72-hour notice requirement, Riley asked the attorney for the 
nurses' union to consider a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 The union agreed to support an extension of the temporary order until at least 
May 9, rather than risk an outright ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he took away our ability to even consider a strike, what tools do we have 
to even get the county back to the negotiating table?" Overmyer asked. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also issued a writ of mandate that effectively blocks a new 
sick-leave policy that nurses found expensive and insulting. Under the policy, 
which the hospital began enforcing in February, nurses had to show a note from 
a private physician after returning after even one day's absence. 
</P>
<P>
 The visit to a private physician cost nurses time and money, the union argued. 
The judge agreed with the union's position that such a policy should be 
discussed in negotiations, not imposed unilaterally by the hospital.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CITY SETTLES DISPUTE OVER DOG'S BARKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Agreeing that problems with a 10-pound terrier who barked too loud and too 
often had been solved, the dog's owner and the city of Oxnard on Monday settled 
a dispute over the issue out of court. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will not declare Missy a nuisance.And Missy's owner, Ann Perez, will 
not seek a hearing on a lawsuit she filed against the city and a county animal 
control officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Barbara A. Lane approved the deal after Perez told the 
judge that Missy actually likes the collar, which emits a high-frequency sound 
that discourages dogs from barking. 
</P>
<P>
 "She knows she can't go outside without the collar," Perez told the judge. "It 
has programmed her to know not to bark unless the barking is required." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez had filed a lawsuit in February to block an order that Missy be silenced 
through a surgical procedure known as "debarking." The suit had described the 
operation as cruelty to animals. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was solved in two ways. First, the neighbor who complained most 
bitterly moved out of state to accept a new job. Perez said her new neighbors 
are animal lovers who own a dog and a cat and enjoy Missy. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, a local pet shop owner provided Missy with a collar that controls a 
dog's barking. Nicholas Bonge said the collar works in about 80% of the cases 
in which it is used. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; BUILDER WON'T HAVE TO FUND SCHOOL LAB

 The Oxnard Union High School District withdrew a demand that a mall developer 
pay the district about $250,000 more than is dictated by state law to 
compensate for additional students, administrators said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The district had threatened to sue the developer over whether the district had 
the right to demand the extra fees, but announced Monday that it would not 
pursue the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have determined that the basis for our proposed (legal) challenge has not 
been tested in the courts and that pursuing it may not be in the best interest 
of the district," said Supt. Bill Studt. "We have also decided to withdraw our 
demand for (fees), other than what is required." 
</P>
<P>
 The district was pressing Camarillo Factory Outlet Stores developer Chelsea 
GCA for about $250,000 worth of computer equipment as a way of offsetting the 
costs of an estimated 30 new students that the development would bring to the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Newport Beach developer said that it thought the district's request 
was too much and that they would pay only the state-mandated $30,000. The 
developer later increased that amount to $75,000 in an attempt to end the 
conflict. But shortly after the offer was made, the district demanded nearly 
$250,000, in addition to the required $30,000, from Chelsea to pay for a 
student computer lab. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter request effectively ended negotiations and began an impasse that 
lasted until Monday's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very pleased that the district has reached the conclusion that we 
drew," said Steven L. Craig, president and chief executive of Chelsea GCA. "We 
harbor no ill will toward the district and look forward to working with them, 
as we do with all members of the communities where we do business." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the state School Facilities Act, developers are required to 
pay school districts $2.65 per square foot of the homes they build and 27 cents 
per square foot of commercial and industrial projects to compensate for extra 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will break ground June 22, officials said. J.E. MITCHELL

 A judge Monday set bail at $250,000 for Jose Santos Castaneda, charged with 
murder and unlawful possession of a firearm in connection with the shooting 
death of his 25-year-old wife in Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Municipal Judge B. Barry Klopfer set the bail at a hearing in 
which Castaneda's arraignment was continued until Monday at the request of 
Deputy Public Defender Steven P. Lipson. 
</P>
<P>
 Mina Castaneda of Oxnard died after being shot in the head during an argument 
with her husband last Saturday, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula police were called about 9 p.m. Saturday to the 200 block of 
Wakeford Avenue on the city's west side with a report that a woman had been 
shot, police said. They found Mina Castaneda on the sidewalk outside a corner 
house near Wakeford Avenue and Bradley Street. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 friends and relatives of the Oxnard College student attended her 
funeral services Friday. They said she had dreams of being a teacher. DWAYNE

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: FOUNDATION AWARDS 6 GRANTS FOR QUAKE RELIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Six nonprofit organizations won grants from the Ventura County Community 
Foundation to defray costs of emergency relief programs following the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Red Cross of Ventura County and FOOD Share each received $2,500 
to pay for relief work in Simi Valley, Fillmore and Piru after the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those grants, however, covered only a fraction of the agencies' expenses. 
FOOD Share spent $7,000 just on gas to transport food into the hardest-hit 
areas of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were overwhelmed with demands on services," said Kate McLean, president 
of the Ventura County Community Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very difficult for organizations already struggling with tight 
operating budgets to put so many resources and personnel out to respond to the 
earthquake," McLean said.  
</P>
<P>
 Other grants awarded included: $2,000 to the Centro de Salud Familiar de 
Fillmore to subsidize medical and psychological care for residents who suffered 
in the earthquake; $1,500 each to Interface Children Family Services and 
Rainbow Recovery Centers' Simi Valley shelter, and $1,000 to Catholic Charities 
of Ventura County for an after-school program to help Fillmore children 
overcome their post-earthquake fears. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake relief money will not affect the Ventura County Community 
Foundation's regular grant cycle. The endowment fund, supported by local 
donations, will distribute about $50,000 this year. Applications will be 
available in August, McLean said. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; BODY OF HOMELESS MAN FOUND IN LOCKED 
CAR

<P>
 The body of an accountant who had been homeless for about a year was 
discovered early Monday inside the locked car where he is believed to have been 
living at a park-and-ride lot alongside the Ventura Freeway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's deputies said that Harrison David Droege, 32, had 
probably been living out of his red 1986 Toyota, which was stuffed with 
clothing, sleeping bags, resumes and suitcases. His decomposed body was found 
huddled inside a sleeping bag in the front passenger seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of death is still under investigation and an autopsy is scheduled 
for this morning. Authorities said they found no signs of foul play or suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked like he'd crawled in to go to sleep and just didn't wake up," said 
Deputy Coroner Craig Stevens. "There's no indication of any trouble, injury or 
foul play. And there's no indication of any drug or alcohol use." 
</P>
<P>
 Droege's car had been locked from the inside and the keys were found inside 
his pocket along with his wallet, which had no cash. A red, 10-speed bike 
belonging to Droege was locked to a post a short distance from the car. The key 
to the bike lock was found inside the car. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe he was probably living out of his car and biking where he wanted 
to go," said Sgt. Mike Barnes of the Ventura County sheriff's major crimes 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Droege's body was discovered in the dirt lot on Rancho Road by several morning 
commuters who noticed the car parked in the same spot several days earlier but 
thought the man inside was asleep. When they saw the car parked in the same 
spot Monday, they walked closer, saw that the body hadn't moved and called 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens said the body had already begun decomposing when it was discovered. 
Droege was last known to be alive last Wednesday when he used his bank card to 
check the balance in his account. Stevens said there was little money in the 
account. 
</P>
<P>
 Droege had lived in Ventura County for about 4 1/2 years. He apparently began 
living out of his car after losing his job last May as a certified public 
accountant for the U.S. Defense Department's Contract Audit Agency in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Stevens, Droege was well-educated and held several graduate 
degrees.  
</P>
<P>
 Droege's only known relative is a sister, Linda, in Indianapolis. She told 
Stevens that she did not know of any illnesses or health problems that might 
have led to her brother's death. JULIE FIELDS

 A Moorpark woman who was run over by her own station wagon was in critical but 
stable condition, hospital officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Amparo Solares, 46, is recovering at Westlake Medical Center after 
emergency surgery Sunday, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's alert and her heart is OK," said Kris Carraway, hospital spokeswoman. 
"Virtually every rib on both sides is broken." 
</P>
<P>
 Solares apparently was getting out of her car when it began rolling backward 
down an incline in the parking lot of a Burger King restaurant at Hampshire and 
Foothill roads, authorities said. She had tried to stop the car from moving and 
the left front wheel rolled down the length of her body, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said at least three restaurant employees and two passers-by lifted 
the station wagon off Solares as her husband pulled her from under the car.

 Efforts to increase security on the campuses of Thousand Oaks high schools may 
include the use of video cameras and golf carts, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the golf carts, which will be used to better patrol the city's four 
high school campuses, was donated by the city-owned Los Robles Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
 Another golf cart already is being used at Thousand Oaks High School, and 
school officials said they were asking other local golf courses to donate used 
carts as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an extremely big deal to us," said Fred Van Leuven, director of 
secondary school education for the Conejo Valley Unified School District. "It 
shows the community is supporting safe schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Leuven said the carts provide school officials with better access to the 
entire campus and allow them to respond more quickly to events on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools are also searching for people to donate video cameras to the 
schools so crimes that occur on campus could be caught on film, Van Leuven 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime on the city's campuses includes theft and vandalism, he said. MATTHEW

 As publicity chairwoman for the Civic Arts Plaza, Helene Ross dreams of 
hanging purple-and-teal advertising banners from every lamppost in Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 She has the design -- a joyous dancer poised mid-flight, surrounded by panels 
advertising the city's 30th anniversary and the performing arts center's 
black-tie grand opening.She also has city approval for the nonprofit project. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Ross just needs to find residents or business owners willing to pay $150 
each to get their name emblazoned on the bottom of a banner. Because city staff 
members hope to maintain some uniformity, company logos will not be printed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping to sell more than 200 banners and blanket the city with them," 
Ross said. "It's a celebration and we want everyone to participate." 
</P>
<P>
 The banners will be installed in early July, about the same time the Civic 
Arts Plaza's box office opens. They will continue to fly from lampposts until 
the inaugural performances in late October. After the grand opening, sponsors 
will be able to keep the banners bearing their names. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information about the banners -- which will measure 2 1/2 by 7 feet 
and be printed on both sides -- call Ross at 496-3787. STEPHANIE SIMON

 La Reina High School in Thousand Oaks finished fifth among 27 teams in the 
state mock trial competition this past weekend in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very proud of the young ladies in the team," said Deputy Dist. 
Atty.Donald C. Glynn, who is one of the team's coaches. "They put a lot of time 
and effort in preparing for the competition." 
</P>
<P>
 The 19 girls in the team spent an average of five hours a week from October 
through February preparing for the competition, Glynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew that we would be one of the finalists because we worked very hard," 
Glynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The team, representing the 360-student Catholic girls school, has won the 
county's high school mock trial competition three times in the past five years. 
This year's fifth place was their best finish yet. Team member Joanna 
Dransfeldt, 18, who won this year's best prosecutor award at the county level, 
also received an award as an outstanding attorney in the state competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a lot of fun," Dransfeldt said. "It was part acting, thinking on your 
feet and part just learning a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 The hypothetical case argued on the state level dealt with child abduction and 
grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn said that after he and the other coaches trained the students on how to 
conduct themselves in court and the laws involved in the case, the students put 
together their own questions, cross-examination and opening and closing 
statements. CHRISTINA LIMA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CAL LUTHERAN TO HOLD SCANDINAVIAN 
FESTIVAL

<P>
 All things Scandinavian -- from pickled vegetables to the poetry of Henrik 
Ibsen -- will be on display as the 21st annual Scandinavian Festival returns to 
Cal Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The poetry of Ibsen, who was better known as a playwright, will be featured in 
a short performance scheduled for 1 p.m. at the Preus-Brandt Forum.Members of 
the Scandinavian Theater Company will read "The Murder of Abraham Lincoln" and 
"Terje Vigen." Tickets are $2 at the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Another well-known Scandinavian author, Swedish American Carl Sandburg, will 
also be honored during the day, with a lecture on his life and works by his 
niece, Jane Matthews, a former Thousand Oaks resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews recently donated family memorabilia to Cal Lutheran's library, 
including a first edition of Sandburg's six-volume book on Abraham Lincoln, 
volumes of poetry signed by Sandburg for his sister and a blue ballpoint pen 
used by the author. The items will be displayed in the library's Scandinavian 
Foundation Room until May 13. 
</P>
<P>
 A children's puppet show will be performed at 1 and at 3 p.m. Children can 
also learn to make Viking hats, trolls and wreaths from 1 to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 But the key component of the festival is food, with demonstrations in the 
morning and a smorgasbord in the late afternoon. Cooks with expertise in making 
items like lefse -- thin potato pancakes -- and Swedish meatballs will 
demonstrate their techniques throughout the day. The smorgasbord, from 3:30 to 
6 p.m., will include pickled herring, salads, smoked ham, Swedish baked beans 
and Norwegian cabbage. 
</P>
<P>
 Festival admission is $3 for adults, $1 for children under 10. Smorgasbord 
admission is $15 for adults, $8 for children. For more information or 
reservations, call (805) 493-3151. MARY F. POLS

COUNCIL WEIGHS POLLING ATTITUDES OF RESIDENTS; THOUSAND OAKS: THE $16,000 
SURVEY WOULD PROBE OPINIONS ABOUT MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT, SERVICES AND POLICIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Does Thousand Oaks need an Olympic-sized swimming pool or an animal shelter? 
More freeway landscaping or more affordable housing? And which would you be 
willing to spend tax dollars -- your tax dollars -- to support? 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks City Council members want to know. 
</P>
<P>
 They're also curious about your income. Whether you're married. Where you 
work. And whether you'd rather see rock 'n' roll, acrobats or business 
conventions in the Civic Arts Plaza auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 To gather all that information, council members tonight will consider spending 
$16,000 to survey constituents. If approved, detailed questionnaires would be 
sent to randomly selected households next month, probing residents' attitudes 
toward the city's government, services and policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members are likely to get an earful. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Response to previous attitude surveys, which are conducted every five years, 
has been strong. Although the forms can take half an hour to fill out, 37% of 
those who received the 1989 questionnaire completed and returned it. 
</P>
<P>
 And politicians generally study the results. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get a 35% response rate, you can't slough it off," Councilwoman Judy 
Lazar said. "Some of the questions ask for really practical, hands-on 
information that we can use in the next four years." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, some answers are predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 Year after year, going back to the first survey in 1968, more than 75% of 
residents have ranked preservation of ridgelines, clean air, public open space 
and a semirural atmosphere as "very important." And year after year, residents 
have called for more low-cost housing and more recreational facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because residents' basic values have remained constant over the years, 
Councilman Alex Fiore complained that the attitude survey sometimes becomes 
little more than a political tool for slow-growth activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too often, the questions are so leading in nature," Fiore said. "For example: 
Should we preserve more oak trees? Of course, 99% of the people will say yes. 
Then when we go to zone something (for more intense development), people stand 
up and wave the attitude survey at us." 
</P>
<P>
 But while some answers may be predictable, the survey also tracks changes in 
residents' attitudes toward their local government. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1989 survey, for example, charted a dramatic drop in citizen satisfaction. 
Only 48% of respondents proclaimed themselves "very satisfied" with life in the 
Conejo Valley, down from 58% in the previous poll. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Thousand Oaks government earned high marks from only 27% of 
respondents -- down 5 percentage points from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the number of people "very satisfied" with the city's policies on 
ridgeline development, hillside grading and oak tree preservation dropped 
significantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne and Dan Birdwell understand those complaints. And this summer, they'll 
register their own, not by filling out a citizen attitude survey but by moving 
to Washington state after nearly 30 years in the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems Thousand Oaks is becoming like the (San Fernando) Valley, though 
people want it to be a small-town atmosphere," Dan Birdwell said. "It's got to 
be the city's fault -- they're the ones who are making the decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But even as the Birdwells move out, 79-year-old Howard Kettering will be 
celebrating the second anniversary of his move to Thousand Oaks, which he 
considers an ideal retirement spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a great town," Kettering said. "The city communicates with me by 
the way it's run: You look around and you see enough parks, enough schools, 
everything conveniently located. It's a well-planned town."

THERAPIST LOSES LICENSE OVER AFFAIR WITH PATIENT; VENTURA: JEROME EVANS' LAWYER 
ARGUES THAT THE REVOCATION IS UNWARRANTED BECAUSE THE PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIP 
ENDED BEFORE THE SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP STARTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura psychologist who had a 10-month affair with a woman he was treating 
for chronic depression had his license revoked Monday by the state Board of 
Psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerome R. Evans, a psychologist since 1971 who also worked in the family care 
clinic at Ventura County Medical Center, was barred from continuing his 
practice after having sex with a woman he had treated dozens of times over 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans, a frequent expert witness in court proceedings, did not return calls 
seeking comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But his attorney said the revocation is unwarranted because Evans, 53, ceased 
the professional relationship before the weekend the two spent at a San 
Francisco hotel in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a former patient. It wasn't a patient," said Oxnard attorney Richard 
A. Regnier, who represents Evans. "That's the whole difference, and it's a 
critical difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something that we'll have to take up later (in court), and the record 
will support us," said Regnier, who argued at one point that the affair was not 
improper because Evans was treating the woman for "vocational counseling" and 
not providing psychological therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Regnier said he expected to appeal the ruling to a Ventura County Superior 
Court judge within weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But the executive director of the Board of Psychology said it is improper for 
a therapist ever to have an affair with a client -- even if the professional 
relationship has ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "The psychotherapy is totally dependent on trust," said Tom O'Connor. "If that 
trust is broken, there's a lot of harm that's going to happen to that patient." 
</P>
<P>
 Revocation of a therapist's license is the appropriate penalty, in part 
because the woman required hospitalization and further psychological treatment 
as a result of the affair, O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the research shows that sexually abusing patients can result in loss of 
self-esteem, depression and there even have been some cases of suicide," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans began the affair during a three-day weekend in San Francisco in early 
September, 1987 -- days after he and the woman kissed in his office, according 
to the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 By mid-September, Evans had referred the woman to another therapist, who 
advised Evans to cease the sexual relationship. After several meetings with the 
woman's new therapist, Evans agreed to end the relationship in June, 1988, the 
medical board said. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans notified the state about his affair with the woman, who has remained 
unidentified for purposes of the hearings, after he agreed to settle a civil 
claim regarding the affair, according to documents on file with the Board of 
Psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 The therapist agreed in 1988 to pay $30,000 to settle a civil complaint lodged 
by the woman, who was divorced by her husband after he found out about the 
affair, according to medical board documents. Evans' insurance company agreed 
to pay another $25,000 under the same agreement, the documents said.  
</P>
<P>
 After a series of hearings conducted in February and March, 1993, an 
administrative law judge determined that Evans was guilty of impropriety and 
should be disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge David R. Rosenman recommended that the Board of Psychology suspend 
Evans' license for 120 days and place him on probation for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 But after further arguments held in Long Beach last month -- oral arguments 
during which Evans and his attorney were present -- the board decided 
unanimously to revoke Evans' license. 
</P>
<P>
 "The focus of these proceedings is not to punish the licensee, the focus is to 
protect the safety of the public," said Deputy Atty. Gen. Elisa B. Wolfe, who 
prosecuted Evans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board evidently found the probation's terms and conditions were not 
sufficient to protect the public," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Regnier said the consensual sex was not improper because the 
doctor-patient relationship had ended, others disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's basically a 'never' rule," said Thomas Nagy, a Palo Alto psychologist 
who spent six years on an ethics committee of the California Psychological 
Assn. "Ninety-nine percent of the time, the therapist terminates the 
relationship, and the potential for adverse results are huge."

INJURY-RIDDLED DUCKS ARE SHUT OUT BY FLAMES 
</P>

<P>
 The Mighty Ducks are among the bottom five in the NHL in scoring when they're 
healthy . So imagine the Ducks without their top three scorers. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what the Calgary Flames got Monday, and they handed the Ducks their 
ninth shutout loss of the season, 3-0, in front of 17,174 at The Pond of 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgary goalie Mike Vernon made 27 saves for his third shutout of the season 
and ninth of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at who's missing. It's incredible we won our last two games," said Duck 
Coach Ron Wilson, whose team had won six of its last eight before Monday. 
"We've got our three-best scorers out and Tony Semenov is 50%. And we lost to a 
team I feel has the best chance to win the Stanley Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 The Flames, winners of the Pacific Division, have quietly moved in on Detroit 
for the best record in the Western Conference. They trail the Red Wings by a 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a 1-0 game after two periods, but Calgary scored twice in the first six 
minutes of the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Theoren Fleury made it 2-0 at 5:28 when German Titov deftly redirected Al 
MacInnis' point shot to him on the power play. Fleury then lifted the puck over 
Mikhail Shtalenkov. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve seconds later, it was 3-0 after Wes Walz skated in on a breakaway after 
the faceoff. That span marked the quickest two goals the Ducks have allowed all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 It's probably just as well for the Ducks that the season ends this week, 
because their injury list grows daily. Left wing Garry Valk, who had become the 
team's leading healthy scorer, was scratched after leaving the ice during the 
morning skate because of a bruised left knee. Terry Yake, who shares the team 
scoring lead with injured Bob Corkum (severed tendon in his foot) was scratched 
for the second consecutive game after suffering a mild concussion, and probably 
won't play in the season finale Wednesday against Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is tough guy Todd Ewen likely to skate in the final game. He has a 
sprained left shoulder. And defenseman Mark Ferner strained his right hamstring 
during the first period and did not return. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Stephan Lebeau, however, did return after missing one game with a sore 
left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was scoreless until 9:17 of the second period, when MacInnis made it 
1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Shtalenkov, given consecutive starts as a reward for his performance Saturday 
at Vancouver, made some good saves, but he needed to be perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, USA Hockey on Monday named Ron Wilson to coach the U.S. team at 
the World Championships April 25-May 8 in Italy. Duck assistant coach Tim Army 
will be one of his assistants.

two, 6-3, 6-1, helping the Panthers to a 10 2/3-10 1/3 victory over Canyon, 
then ranked ninth in the county. Led by O'Neill, who is 27-0 this season, 
Orange is challenging the Century League's traditional tennis powers, Canyon,

DIGEST: CSUN EXPECTED TO SIGN DORSEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the state's top junior college shooters is expected to sign a letter of 
intent with the Cal State Northridge basketball team on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Dorsey, a 6-foot-5 1/2 forward from L.A. City College has given 
Northridge coaches a verbal commitment.City Coach Mike Miller said Monday that 
Dorsey chose the Matadors over Nevada, Howard, Drake, Southern Utah and 
Northern Arizona. Dorsey could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey averaged 15 points and 8.5 rebounds a game while shooting slightly 
better than 66%, making him the second-best marksman among the state's JC 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a complete player," Miller said. "He can score, he can rebound, he's 
smart and he plays hard on both ends of the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll be the most athletic player on the Northridge team. He'll give them a 
presence they don't have." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey is the third player from L.A. City to accept a Division I scholarship. 
Point guard Raheem Muhammad is committed to UC Irvine and center Marty 
Cartwright signed with New Mexico in November. Dorsey was the team's most 
valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best of the three," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey's commitment most likely completes Northridge's recruiting. The 
Matadors signed Reseda High point guard Trenton Cross and Thousand Oaks High 
center Paul Brandt during the November signing period. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge also has commitments from forward Eric Gray from Canada College in 
Redwood City, Calif., and Washington transfer Sam Allen, a forward who will 
redshirt next season. MIKE HISERMAN

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / MIKE REILLEY; VENTURA CENTER CONSIDERS UCI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If all goes as planned, UC Irvine basketball player Todd Whitehead might soon 
see a familiar face in the Anteaters' recruiting class. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Irvine is one of five finalists pursuing Michael Tate, a former teammate of 
Whitehead's at Los Angeles Fremont High and a standout center at Ventura 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 Tate, 6 feet 5 and 215 pounds, visited Irvine last weekend, said Phil Mathews, 
Ventura's coach. Tate also has visited Utah and Utah State, and is planning 
visits to San Diego State and Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews said Tate plans on making all of his recruiting visits before making a 
decision, meaning he won't be signing Wednesday, the first day of the spring 
signing period. 
</P>
<P>
 "He really doesn't have a front-runner (choice)," Mathews said. "But he did 
say that he liked Irvine a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Tate played at Ventura in 1991-92, then sat out the 1992-93 season as a 
redshirt, concentrating on academics. 
</P>
<P>
 He started 22 of Ventura's 36 games this season, averaging 11.3 points, 10.1 
rebounds and two steals. 
</P>
<P>
 He sat out 14 games because of a stress fracture in his right ankle but 
returned to average 20 points and 11.3 rebounds in three State tournament 
games. Ventura lost to Long Beach College, 63-61, in the State title game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great athlete," Mathews said. "He's only 6-4 1/2, but it doesn't 
matter. He hits the boards like Dennis Rodman. Irvine would be a nice place for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add recruiting: Women's Coach Colleen Matsuhara has only one scholarship free, 
and doesn't anticipate filling it until next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsuhara also will have to fill an assistant coach's position. She relieved 
Marcus Carroll of his one-year contract in March. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Stop the presses: Peter the Anteater will get a hip new look this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The UC Irvine Alumni Assn. has donated a $1,300 Anteater mascot costume to the 
athletic department. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be unveiled at 7:30 a.m. Saturday at the "Zot Trot" five-kilometer run 
walk. 
</P>
<P>
 The public also is invited to compete in several athletic-related contests 
with Irvine athletes throughout the day at the Student Center terrace on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The track and field teams will be split this weekend, with some athletes 
competing at the Mt. SAC relays and others at the Pomona College Invitational. 
Freshman Laura Monson remained undefeated in the 3,000-meter run, winning in a 
career-best 9 minutes 49.54 seconds last week in a triangular meet with UCLA 
and Cal State Northridge. . . . Junior Chris Tontz moved into the national 
tennis rankings (No. 86) for the first time in his career. . . . The men's 
tennis team moved from 36th to 30th in the national rankings this week. . . . 
Senior Drew Sells finished second at the Anteater Invitational golf tournament 
last week, which Irvine won. . . . The men's volleyball team gained its first 
conference victory of the season, beating UC San Diego in five games at 
Crawford Hall. Irvine broke a 17-match losing streak. . . . Irvine's sailing 
team finished third in the Frils Trophy Regatta at Tufts University in Medford, 
Mass., last weekend. The competition was split into two divisions. Peter Wells 
and Jonathan Posner won Division A for Irvine.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL: KLECKNER NOW RELAXED AT PLATE, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rich Kleckner of Saddleback College loves the role a catcher plays in 
directing a team. He always has. 
</P>
<P>
 It pains him to see the job done incorrectly. So much so that once, when he 
was playing center field, Kleckner asked for time, called the catcher out and 
explained what he was doing wrong behind the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Kleckner was 8 and playing Little League in Missoula, Mont., when the incident 
took place. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's something I'll always remember," Kleckner said. "I take catching very 
seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Kleckner's love of catching has grown and now he is the starter for 
Saddleback. Kleckner is having a strong season defensively and offensively. He 
is hitting .346 with four doubles, a home run and has driven in 13 runs. He 
also has thrown out 33 of 67 runners attempting to steal, including 14 of 22 in 
Orange Empire Conference games. 
</P>
<P>
 There never has been much question about Kleckner's defensive abilities since 
he arrived at Saddleback in the fall of 1991. At best, he figured to be the 
Gauchos' third catcher, so he and Coach Jack Hodges decided he would be a 
redshirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could tell he was very sound behind the plate and could handle pitchers," 
Hodges said. "He just needed to get a little bigger and stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the experience was rewarding considering how much he learned, 
Kleckner also found it to be a trying time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never sat before," he said. "It was really frustrating. Sometimes I 
would go home and say to myself, 'What am I doing here? I should go someplace 
where I can step right in and play.' But by the end of the season I was happy 
that I had stayed with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kleckner had figured to be a reserve last season as a freshman. But injuries 
relegated returning starter Nathan Malagon to designated hitter much of the 
time. Kleckner started 32 of 45 games. 
</P>
<P>
 He was solid defensively but struggled on offense more than at any time in his 
career. He didn't raise his average above .200 until the final two weeks and 
finished at .210. He was an all-conference selection mostly because of his 
defensive skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rich never really settled into the job," Hodges said. "He was kind of 
pressing at times. This year he is a lot more relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
 There are two basic reasons Kleckner has improved his hitting so much this 
season: hard work and confidence. Starting last summer, he began to take extra 
hitting practice and has worked long hours in the batting cage and off a tee as 
well. Kleckner also lost about 15 pounds to get down to 190, which he says 
makes him quicker. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has regained the confidence he had when he led his American Legion 
team in hitting in the summer of 1991 in Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year I really got a push from everyone," Kleckner said. "It helps when 
others have confidence in you . . . Last year I was afraid to go down in the 
count, 0-2. This year I'm not." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Basketball assistants: Bryan Humphrey and Pat O'Hern have been selected as 
assistants by Cypress Coach Paul Bottiaux, who starts his first season next 
fall. Both will work in walk-on roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphrey comes to Cypress from Sonora High School, where he has been a 
basketball assistant and a track and field coach the last 10 seasons. 
Humphrey's son, Grayle, played at Cypress (1988-90) before getting a 
scholarship to Boise State. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be the second tour as an assistant for O'Hern, who also was at Cypress 
for the 1992-93 season. O'Hern, a special education teacher at Kennedy High 
School, has worked as a boys' basketball assistant at Kennedy and Western high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Community College Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Dee Dee Miranda, the first baseman for the Fullerton softball team, is having 
an outstanding season in the field. She started the week having made only four 
errors in 251 chances for a .984 fielding percentage. . . . Cypress (24-8) and 
Riverside (23-6) are tied for the lead in the baseball race with 10-3 records. 
Saddleback (18-9-1, 9-6) is third and Rancho Santiago (24-8, 7-6) is fourth. 
The Dons, the four-time defending conference champions, have lost six of their 
last 10 conference games. Fullerton (15-13-1, 6-8) is fifth, Golden West 
(11-14, 5-8) sixth and Orange Coast (6-21, 1-14).

<TEXT>
<P>
 Legislation allowing communities to ban the sale of excessively violent video 
games to children has been introduced in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would create a Video Game Rating Administration (VGRA), similar to 
the motion picture rating system, and allow community leaders to rate and 
regulate the sale and rental of video games. 
</P>
<P>
 A tax of 25 cents per game cartridge and $100 per arcade video game would be 
imposed to cover rating administrative costs. Any surplus funds would go to 
public libraries. 
</P>
<P>

SCHOOL FACES QUESTIONS ON HANDLING OF SEX CHARGES; EDUCATION: TEACHER'S AIDE IN 
COMPTON DISTRICT ADMITS HAVING SEX WITH GIRL, 14, WHO WAS PREGNANT WHEN SHE 
ACCUSED HIM OF MOLESTATION. EARLIER CHARGES BY THREE OTHER GIRLS WERE NOT 
REPORTED TO POLICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD BLUME, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When a popular teacher's aide was accused in 1992 by three young girls at a 
Compton middle school of molesting them, school officials did not report the 
allegations to police as required by law, according to the district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, school officials called the girls liars, the teacher's aide denounced 
the girls publicly and other students kicked and taunted two of the girls for 
complaining about the aide, said an attorney who has filed a lawsuit on behalf 
of the three alleged victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The aide, Twone Torri Flowers, was well liked at Enterprise Middle School, 
said administrators and students. He was a busy community activist and a 
talented musician whose work had won public commendation from the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in January, a 14-year-old girl made similar allegations. And she was 
pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the three other students, police said she told authorities that Flowers 
had written her hall passes to get out of class. She added that Flowers had sex 
with her a number of times during school in the media room, prosecutors said.  
</P>
<P>
 Police and prosecutors said that when questioned, Flowers, 24, admitted having 
sex with the girl, and last month he pleaded no contest to one count of 
committing a lewd and lascivious act with a child under the age of 14. When he 
is sentenced today in Compton Superior Court, Flowers could receive a six-year 
prison sentence under a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 But the matter is far from concluded.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The school district's handling of the situation has raised questions about why 
officials did not notify police after the first three students accused Flowers 
of molesting them and why a teacher's aide had so much authority and so little 
oversight. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Flowers, who has been in jail since his January arrest, nor his 
attorney would comment on the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials have refused to comment, other than to say that they are 
investigating what happened and do not condone, encourage or defend any 
improper conduct by employees. The Compton Unified School District makes every 
effort to protect students, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The official duties of Flowers, a teacher's aide since 1989, were to tutor 
students and supervise the playground at Enterprise, according to the district. 
But Flowers also was given other tasks, including directing the chorus, because 
he worked well with students and was a skilled musician with a flair for gospel 
music who could play the piano and organ, said administrators and students. 
</P>
<P>
 Last July, Compton Mayor Omar Bradley appointed Flowers to the city Parks and 
Recreation Commission, a post Flowers still holds, according to the city 
clerk's office. In November, Flowers ran unsuccessfully for the school board, 
finishing 16th in a field of 20 with 2.3% of the vote.  
</P>
<P>
 The parents of the first three accusers, who made their allegations in 
November, 1992, recently filed a civil suit against Flowers and Compton 
Unified. They are seeking unspecified damages for alleged assault and battery, 
harassment and negligence, said Leon Jenkins, their attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 After being notified by the parents, the district attorney's office 
investigated the first allegations. They filed no charges against Flowers 
because of inconsistencies in the girls' accounts and a lack of corroborating 
evidence, said Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Sindee Kain-Kerker. 
Prosecutors filed charges in the later case, Kain-Kerker said, because the girl 
was pregnant and Flowers admitted having sex with her.  
</P>
<P>
 Charges could have been filed against school officials for not reporting the 
initial allegations. Failure to report allegations of molestation to police is 
a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of $1,000.  
</P>
<P>
 "The principal was required by law to report the allegation to police when it 
came to her attention that there was a complaint of misconduct," Kain-Kerker 
said. "But she decided to handle it internally."  
</P>
<P>
 School officials were not prosecuted because it would have been difficult to 
prove that they should have been suspicious of Flowers, Kain-Kerker said.  
</P>
<P>
 The pregnant girl, whose name is being withheld because of her age, has given 
birth to a girl. Police said Flowers pressured her into a relationship that 
spanned a two-year period, starting when the girl was a 12-year-old 
sixth-grader. The family complained about Flowers directly to the police, 
rather than first going to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's outrageous about this incident is that it happened during the school 
day, in the middle of the school," Kain-Kerker said. "And it's not that it 
happened just one time, either. It's outrageous that this would happen, and 
it's outrageous that no one would know about it."  
</P>
<P>
 The teacher's aide retaliated by verbally harassing the girls, according to 
the lawsuit. Flowers dropped one of his accusers from the chorus, students 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 During the police investigation of the first allegations, Flowers was briefly 
transferred to a central office desk job, but only after the parents complained 
that he was continuing to harass their daughters, said district sources who 
asked not to be named. When no charges were filed in the first case, Flowers 
returned to Enterprise, district sources said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 District records do not contain detailed information about whether Flowers was 
transferred or exactly what his work duties were, school officials said. The 
officials said the district did not rehire Flowers for the start of the current 
school year, but sources inside the district said Flowers worked at another 
middle school as late as mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
 Flowers told police that at Enterprise he ran the media department and 
directed the chorus, an account corroborated by several students and a teacher, 
who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 The students and the teacher added that Flowers sometimes taught the chorus 
class, a credit course that met during school hours. Flowers, as a teacher's 
aide, could not legally have been allowed to teach a class. 
</P>
<P>
 "Flowers was given authority that exceeded anything that a teacher's aide 
should have had," said a district administrator who asked not to be named. "He 
was covering teachers' classes by himself and meting out discipline. Students 
probably thought this guy was a teacher."  
</P>
<P>
 District officials said Flowers was not functioning as a teacher, and in fact, 
the reports cards for chorus students are signed by a credentialed teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no dispute that the chorus has performed under the direction of 
Flowers, and sang on occasion before Compton city officials as well as the 
school board. His work drew warm praise from board members, who publicly 
encouraged him to get a teaching credential. 
</P>
<P>
 When the girls and their parents first complained about Flowers, Principal 
LaVonne Johnson reportedly said she would look into the allegations. According 
to police records, Johnson never notified law enforcement authorities, the 
prosecutor said.  
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who was promoted last year to assistant superintendent, could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls' parents, dissatisfied with the school's response, contacted police. 
Flowers had persistently pursued one of the girls and had fondled two girls, 
according to the lawsuit. One of the girls, an eighth-grader, told police 
Flowers loaned her money, sent her love letters and wrote her hall passes to 
get out of class. She also told police that the two had kissed, and had spoken 
many times on the phone after school. The girl's father intercepted one of the 
calls, the parents said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls who complained about Flowers received repeated threats from 
students, the lawsuit says. Jenkins said the threats prompted the girls to 
apply for a transfer to another school. One of the girls was denied a transfer, 
according to school district paperwork supplied by Jenkins. A brief notation 
reads: "No knowledge of threats/no formal conference regarding the matter." The 
form is signed by then-Principal Johnson and another administrator, who is no 
longer with the district. Several weeks later, officials reconsidered and 
eventually granted all the transfers, Jenkins alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Flowers was popular with many students and would allegedly write hall passes 
to get some of his favorites out of class, students said. Flowers would often 
send for the girl who became pregnant, Kain-Kerker said. Ostensibly, the girl 
was helping Flowers with choir duties or other school-related tasks, she said. 
But this was also the pretext Flowers used for arranging sexual liaisons, the 
deputy district attorney said.  
</P>
<P>
 One teacher told police that the girl, who has a learning disability, was 
falling behind in her schoolwork because she was taken out of class so often. 
Earlier, the teacher had called the girl's mother to say that the girl's 
schoolwork was suffering because she was spending too much time on 
extracurricular activities. But the teacher never mentioned that the girl was 
being pulled out of class, the girl's mother said.

<P>
 In January, a doctor's exam confirmed that the girl was seven months pregnant, 
and the girl named Flowers as the father, police said. Flowers neither 
confirmed nor denied that he was the baby's father, Kain-Kerker said. He told 
police that the relationship was consensual, she said, but under the law, sex 
with an underage girl is considered statutory rape.  
</P>
<P>
 The girl's mother, while upset at Flowers, said she is at least as angry with 
the school administration and other teachers. "If someone sends for a student 
that many times, there should be an inquiry," she said. "No one should have 
access to a student at any time. It was too easy to get my daughter out of her 
class. If the school had any suspicions, it should have done a thorough 
investigation."

BETTER BUYS ON CITY SUPPLIES; FINANCES: WACHS SAYS PURCHASING AGENTS COULD SAVE 
MILLIONS JUST BY GOING TO RETAIL STORES. BUT THEY ARE HAMPERED BY AN OVERSUPPLY 
OF RED TAPE.

 Don't hold a seat on "The Price Is Right" for those Los Angeles city 
purchasing agents. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Joel Wachs, announcing a review of the way the city buys 
supplies, said his staff found better deals than the city gets just by going 
across the street from City Hall to an office supply store. 
</P>
<P>
 Some examples: Legal pads that cost taxpayers $1.80 each, went for only 20 
cents retail. A box of computer diskettes set them back $24.99, compared to 
$6.59 that the man on the street would pay. And the city paid $7.29, instead of 
$1.99, for a ream of white copier paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs said he believes the city can cut as much as 10%, or $70 million, from 
its $700 million in annual purchases. "This city has got to go on a diet and 
this is the place to start," Wachs said, amid stacks of copier paper, computer 
disks, glue sticks and file folders. 
</P>
<P>
 Other city officials agreed with Wachs that a proliferation of regulations 
designed to prevent fraud, and to promote other goals, has driven up costs and 
caused delays. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were unclear on how much savings can be achieved. A survey last year 
by the city controller's office showed much smaller price discrepancies than 
reported by Wachs. "It's probably a much smaller universe, in terms of savings, 
that we are talking about, but it's still worthwhile," said one official 
familiar with city purchasing procedures, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the controller's office, the city administrative office and the 
Department of General Services -- which oversee most purchasing -- agreed that 
a review is a good idea. Hearings are scheduled to begin April 27 before the 
Governmental Efficiency Committee, which Wachs chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman's survey focused on purchases made through several contract 
companies for special orders. The city acquires most of its supplies through 
bulk orders that are generally cheaper than special orders. But many city 
bureaucrats turn to the contractors and their higher prices because it can take 
up to three weeks to get the bulk goods that are sitting in city warehouses, 
said Greg Nelson, Wachs' chief deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs said that the city's purchasing agents are further hamstrung by a 
Byzantine set of regulations that were put in place to prevent fraud and 
favoritism. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems also arise because it can take three months or more for the 
Department of General Services to verify the delivery of goods. That, in turn, 
delays payments and disqualifies the city from receiving discounts that are 
contingent on prompt payment, said Michael J. Inouye, chief administrative 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 In other cases, the City Council has intentionally volunteered to pay higher 
prices to achieve certain policy goals. For instance, it offers a bidding 
preference in purchases of less than $25,000 to companies based in Los Angeles 
County. The incentive is designed to promote local businesses. But the city can 
pay as much as 5% more to accomplish that goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Other city laws require that companies using recycled materials be given 
preference over those that do not, and that firms that include minorities and 
women be chosen over those that are run by white men -- although the latter 
program has been at least temporarily invalidated by a state appellate court. 
</P>
<P>
 Controller Rick Tuttle's survey last year found that, on routinely purchased 
items, the city fared somewhat better -- sometimes besting retail prices but 
sometimes not, despite its ability to buy in bulk. Wachs said the city's system 
has become so complex, and payments are so slow, that many vendors no longer 
bid for the business. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that city purchasing agents and others cannot be blamed because they 
have been saddled with the regulations, many of which can only be undone by the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs said several possible solutions will be considered by his committee, 
including: reducing scrutiny of purchases under $1,000, which now take nearly 
half of city buyers' time; raising the level of permissible petty cash 
purchases from $100 to $200 or more; acquiring city credit cards that allow 
employees to make purchases when they can find a good deal; improving the 
computer system used to make and track purchases; consolidating most purchases 
in one department, instead of the five departments that now handle them. Price 
Comparisons Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs' staff conducted a survey of 
prices the city pays for an array of specially ordered office supplies. The 
survey revealed that the city often pays many times more for its supplies than 
prices offered at discount stores. 03,27,11,14 MATERIALS CITY PAID RETAIL PRICE

SCOTT HARRIS: LEARNING A LESSON ABOUT STAYING AFLOAT; IT ISN'T JUST HIS 
LIVELIHOOD THAT IS BEING THREATENED, HE SAYS, BUT THE VERY LIVES OF THE 
CHILDREN WHO MAY NOT LEARN TO SWIM IF NOT FOR SERVICES LIKE HIS.

 One of the smaller prices of living in Los Angeles is the drone of the 
freeway. Many of us live within earshot, and when visitors from out of state 
make rude comments, we say you get used to it -- that it sounds like the murmur 
of a river or surf on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Jim Herrick's place, the Ventura Freeway is just beyond the back fence, 
and there's no sound wall to muffle its roar. This, and the jetliners from 
Burbank Airport that rumble overhead, make the sign on his west wall seem a bit 
funny. "Out of consideration of my neighbors," it says, "please try to keep the 
noise to a minimum." 
</P>
<P>
 That means you, kid -- the toddler afraid of the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Herrick operates a back-yard swim school, much to the annoyance of the 
woman who lives behind the sign that says hush. Herrick has described Marty 
Mendenhall as "my neighbor from hell." The feeling is probably mutual. Herrick 
and Mendenhall have been going round and round for more than five years now, 
campaigning for the allegiance of neighbors, zoning officials and the Los 
Angeles City Council. And now they're at it again. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is a different kind of NIMBY issue. Prisons, landfills, halfway houses, 
toxic waste dumps -- these are things that make people shout, "Not In My Back 
Yard." So it isn't likely the battle over the swim school at 11846 Kling St. 
will ever make the 11 o'clock news. 
</P>
<P>
 To the combatants, however, the dispute is fraught with deep meaning. Talk to 
Marty Mendenhall or Lori Dinkin, president of the Valley Village Homeowners 
Assn., and you'll hear a tale about a man who has flouted the law and a city 
that fails to enforce its own zoning ordinances. You'll hear about the 
political clout of an "elitist" clientele who can afford Herrick's one-on-one 
service in favor of lessons at the local Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk to Jim Herrick, and you'll hear about how silly rules and regulations are 
ruining our quality of life. It isn't just his livelihood that is being 
threatened, he says, but the very lives of the children who may not learn to 
swim if not for services like his. 
</P>
<P>
 The tale begins in 1987, when Herrick first bought the home on Kling Street 
with the swimming pool and the long lot. A burly man with red hair and a beard, 
Herrick had operated the old Sherman Oaks Swim School on Ventura Boulevard for 
many years until his landlord sold the property out from under him in the early 
'80s. When he bought the house on Kling Street and opened for business, he 
says, "I never realized it was illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, he found out when Marty Mendenhall made her first complaint. 
Mendenhall does art restorations in her home. This can be painstaking work, and 
while freeway and jetliner noise is predictable, the occasional tantrum of a 
child or the encouraging shouts of a proud parent can be a headache. She 
tolerated Herrick's operation, she says, until construction began on a second 
swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 So off to City Hall they went. The Valley Village Homeowners Assn. sided with 
Mendenhall, determined to keep commercial operations out of a residential zone. 
But Herrick secured the support from most of the neighbors in the immediate 
area as well as his clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrick has stayed open by adhering to a variety of conditions, such as the 
construction of an 8-foot-high cinder-block wall to buffer the noise, and 
limitations on instructional hours. But in June, 1992, officials made it clear 
that Herrick should try to find a new location by Sept. 30, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 So now it's April, 1994. Last month, Herrick and Mendenhall squared off again 
before the Board of Zoning Appeals. Herrick's plea is that the price of 
commercial property is prohibitive and no bank would grant a loan for a swim 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel's chairman seemed inclined to pull the plug on Herrick's pools. Then 
another board member pointed out that, in a recent meeting, approval had been 
granted for a day-care center in an R-1 neighborhood that would accommodate up 
to 35 children all day long, 365 days a year. What, she asked, is so intrusive 
about a swim school? 
</P>
<P>
 Mendenhall was not pleased, not even by the board's order that Herrick replace 
the bougainvillea vines along his wall with "mature trees." A zoning official 
pointed out that trees would lower the noise by one or two decibels. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll just appeal it," Mendenhall muttered. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One person who'll be rooting for Herrick is Barbara Burwell, whose own 
back-yard swim school in Northridge fell victim to the county's officiousness 
last year after 30 years of operation. Mrs. B's Swim School, as it was known, 
had taught thousands of children without incident before a county inspector 
determined that the slope of the pool violated safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
 One parent visiting Herrick's school was dismayed by Mrs. B's fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the kind of stuff that just fries me," Lisa Goldberg said as her 
4-year-old daughter, Hannah, was receiving her first lesson of the season. The 
lessons aren't cheap -- $17 for a 20-minute session. But Goldberg, a Studio 
City resident, figures it's well worth it -- and she hopes the baby she's 
expecting will have a chance to learn to swim here as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Must be one of those elitists I'd heard about. How would she feel, I asked, if 
somebody opened a swim school next door to her? 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was this swim school," she said, "I don't think I'd have a problem." 
</P>

OCTAVIA THE OCTOPUS DIES AS TANK EMPTIES; ANIMALS: THE SEA CREATURE AT SAN 
PEDRO AQUARIUM APPARENTLY TORE OFF A DRAIN PIPE WITH HER TENTACLES OVERNIGHT. 
THE DEATH INTENSIFIES CONTROVERSY OVER HER CAPTIVITY.

<P>
 Alas, poor Octavia, she pulled the plug. 
</P>
<P>
 And therein is the sad end to the story of Octavia the Octopus, in life one of 
the great controversies -- and drawing cards -- of San Pedro's Cabrillo Marine 
Aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
 In death, she is the object of charges and countercharges of what should have 
happened but didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Octavia the Octopus was found dead Monday morning at the bottom of her 
waterless tank. Aquarium officials surmise that she used one of her powerful 
tentacles to pull off a plastic pipe that served as a water drain. With the 
pipe removed, water began to flow out faster than it was coming in. The end was 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 When a custodian arrived at 6:30 a.m., he found Octavia. On Monday afternoon, 
animal rights activist Kathy Yandell was in front of the aquarium carrying a 
sign bearing the word shame.  
</P>
<P>
 For weeks, Octavia had been the source of controversy. Caught by fishermen off 
San Clemente Island in January, she was the first giant Pacific octopus to go 
on display at the aquarium. The row began almost immediately.  
</P>
<P>
 The target of the original protest was the size of the aquarium that became 
Octavia's new home. Animal rights protesters said the orange-red giant was far 
too big for the 4-by-5-foot tank, that Octavia should be freed, or at least be 
placed in a larger tank. 
</P>
<P>
 The aquarium's exhibit director, Mike Schaadt, countered that the tank was 
just fine and that an octopus is most comfortable in snug surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters said Octavia might fall victim to octopus automutilation 
syndrome, which is exactly what the name implies, if kept in the tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaadt said that Octavia was doing fine, eating well and moving about the way 
a healthy octopus should. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters carried placards depicting a tearful octopus that said, "Please Let 
Me Go Home." The aquarium said no way. 
</P>
<P>
 "They received many signed petitions by children and adults urging them to let 
the octopus go," said Lisa Lange, international campaigns manager for People 
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an animal rights group. "Instead, they 
chose to keep her and now she's dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Lange also said there should have been more safeguards to keep the octopus 
from pulling the plug on the drain. 
</P>
<P>
 "No other octopus we know has ever pulled the plug from its own tank," she 
said. "If they had let her go, this wouldn't have happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Schaadt, in response, said that precautions were taken and that the pipe was 
glued in with a silicone sealer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely amazing to us that this happened," he said. "We are very 
saddened here at the aquarium." 
</P>
<P>
 Lange also said she had received a call early this morning, before Octavia was 
discovered, from a Los Angeles animal rights activist worried that the octopus 
had taken on a whitish tone. Lange said it was a well-known fact that such 
coloration in an octopus was a sign of stress. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schaadt said Octavia was able to turn a number of colors, depending on the 
circumstances. He said the octopus turned white when she appeared to be in her 
"quiet state." Further, he contended that releasing the octopus might not have 
been the best thing, that all manner of things could have gone wrong once 
Octavia was freed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe she was better off in our care," he said. "We believe we did the 
best we could." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps so, but on Monday afternoon, Schaadt was taking his lumps. A protester 
carried a sign that said: "Mike Schaadt, What Are the Children Learning Now?"

DDT WORRIES RACK NEIGHBORHOOD; POLLUTION: THREE FAMILIES MOVE OUT OF HOMES IN 
TORRANCE AREA WHILE THE EPA WORKS TO REMOVE CHEMICALLY CONTAMINATED SOIL FROM 
YARDS. OTHERS SAY THEY WANT TO JOIN THE EXODUS.

<P>
 Nervous neighbors watched from the sidewalk as Guillermo and Leticia Aguirre 
packed their car with suitcases Monday morning and prepared to move from their 
modest stucco bungalow near Torrance to a nearby hotel at federal expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Some neighbors said they, too, want to pack their suitcases and join the 
exodus. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, three families temporarily moved from their homes to hotels Monday so 
that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency could begin digging 
DDT-contaminated soil from their back yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Supposedly all three families will return home in 10 days to two weeks when 
the excavation is finished. 
</P>
<P>
 But Guillermo Aguirre is so disturbed and angered by news of a banned 
pesticide in the soil outside his door that he has told the EPA he never wants 
to return to the home he rents on West 204th Street in an unincorporated area 
wedged between Torrance and Carson.  
</P>
<P>
 "I asked them to close down the whole place," said Aguirre as he prepared to 
leave his house. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern has mounted in this working-class neighborhood with news of 
higher-than-expected chemical levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Although federal experts say they remain perplexed about why extremely high 
levels of DDT have been found in two back yards, many residents believe the 
pesticide migrated from the former site of Montrose Chemical Corp., once a 
major manufacturer of DDT. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aguirre house is located about a quarter-mile from the Montrose site, 
which is on the federal Superfund list of the nation's most hazardous waste 
sites. A second proposed Superfund location known as the Del Amo site -- which 
was formerly a synthetic rubber manufacturing plant -- sits directly north of 
West 204th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Many have lived for years on this quiet, tree-lined street without giving much 
thought to the two nearby sites, but the most recent test results have been 
jarring. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Aguirres drove off on Monday, some onlookers talked ominously about the 
latest turn of events: test results released Friday that showed DDT levels as 
much as 45 times higher than what is considered safe in an area near Aguirre's 
yard. The testing was conducted up to three feet beneath the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, other residents are wondering if they, too, should move away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned about my health. I want out of here," said Carmen Herrera, who 
lives across the street from the Aguirres. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary stuff here, with all they're finding. . . . I feel trapped in a 
cage, and I can't get out. And it scares me." 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera would like to see prominent signs warning of chemical problems posted 
on streets leading into her neighborhood, much like the Medfly quarantine signs 
seen elsewhere in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents have reported health complaints such as rashes, breathing 
problems, nausea and headaches. Guillermo Aguirre says he has trouble 
breathing, and his next-door neighbor complains of burning eyes and headaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials counter, however, that there is no clear evidence linking 
neighborhood health problems to DDT. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, even the news last Friday of DDT levels exceeding 4,000 parts per 
million does not signal a health hazard, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not what we would consider an emergency removal. They are only 
leaving their homes because of the nuisance factor. There is absolutely no 
health or safety factor why they're leaving their homes," said Paula Bruin, 
spokeswoman at the EPA's western regional office. 
</P>
<P>
 DDT was widely used as a pesticide before being banned in the United States in 
1972. It damages the reproduction of wildlife and is suspected of causing 
cancer in humans. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials recommend precautions when DDT levels exceed 100 p.p.m., and 
immediate cleanup is considered warranted when levels top 260 p.p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Aguirre and his next-door neighbor, Cynthia Babich, have asked to be 
permanently relocated because of the DDT, but federal officials say that is 
unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just not something that anyone is assuming or imagining at this time," 
says Bruin. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other neighboring families hope to be moved temporarily during the work. 
Robin Hatch says she does not want her 2-month-old daughter, Michelle, to be in 
the neighborhood during the daytime when the excavation is under way. Neighbor 
Marla Frame says she wants to move her daughter and infant grandson during the 
excavation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know what they're going to find while they're digging," Frame said. 
It remained unclear Monday if the EPA would agree to her request. 
</P>
<P>
 The excavation project initially was expected to remove 8,000 cubic feet of 
soil from two back yards, at a cost of $317,866. However, that was calculated 
before the most recent test results, which will mean more soil may be removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could cost more. I wouldn't say, at this point, a lot more. It really 
depends," said EPA spokeswoman Virginia Donohue. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA is planning an open house to answer questions about the Montrose and Del 
Amo sites Thursday starting at 6 p.m., followed by a public forum from 7 to 
9:30 p.m., at the Vandeene School Auditorium, 829 Javelin St.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BEVERLY HILLS; JACKSON 
FAN CHARGED IN CALLS TO FIGURE IN LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Michael Jackson fan was charged Monday with three misdemeanor counts for 
allegedly making obscene phone calls to the father of a boy who filed a civil 
lawsuit against the singer.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty.Rhonda Saunders said Denise Michelle Pfeiffer, 24, a native 
of Great Britain, was arrested Thursday after scrawling graffiti on the 
sidewalk outside the office of the teen-age boy's father March 31.  
</P>
<P>
 Police investigators said the obscene telephone calls charge stems from a 
message left on the answering machine at the father's office March 28. Two days 
later, Pfeiffer allegedly stole the keys to the restroom of his Beverly Hills 
office.  
</P>
<P>
 Pfeiffer, who has been in the United States for about a month, was arrested at 
the father's house after a family member talked to her and called police, 
investigators said.  
</P>
<P>
 Jackson has been the focus of investigations in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara 
counties since last summer, when the then 13-year-old boy claimed that he had 
been molested by the superstar.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY 
WORKERS OK 2-YEAR CONTRACT WITH NO RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The union that represents 6,500 blue-collar Los Angeles city workers has voted 
overwhelmingly for a contract that grants no pay raise, but guarantees that 
employees will not be laid off or have their pay cut because of Mayor Richard 
Riordan's plans to turn some city services over to private companies. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 80% of the voting members of the Service Employees International 
Union, Local 347, approved the contract through June 30, 1996.It offered no 
raise for the next two fiscal years and no retroactive pay hike for the nearly 
two years workers went without a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "No employees will suffer a demotion, layoff or loss of pay as a result of 
contracting," said Dave Trowbridge, leader of the union that represents 
custodians, trash haulers and security officers. "Job security was and is our 
primary issue."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTH GATE; CANDIDATE 
ATTACKED WHILE POSTING CAMPAIGN SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South Gate City Council candidate Billie Martinez was attacked by three young 
men wielding sticks early Saturday while posting campaign signs along Long 
Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack was not politically motivated, South Gate police officials said.It 
is being investigated as a gang-related incident and has been referred to the 
Metro Gang Task Force, a regional law enforcement group. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was stapling a campaign poster to a fence on Long Beach Boulevard 
near Liberty Street between 1:30 and 3 a.m. when three young men emerged from 
an older model, dark blue or black BMW, according to Martinez and police 
reports.  
</P>
<P>
 The men came up behind Martinez and struck him on the head with a stick, then 
beat and kick him. Martinez said he knocked one man to the ground during the 
scuffle. The council candidate said the attacker got up and pointed a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as I saw a gun barrel, I started running," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attackers pursued Martinez for a short distance until he encountered a 
police patrol car and reported the assault. Martinez suffered a gash in the 
head and bruises but was not hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said gang slogans were yelled during the assault and that the attackers 
appeared to belong to a group from outside of South Gate.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: ANTELOPE VALLEY; PROBE 
INTO POISONING OF TEACHER INTENSIFIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities interviewed about 70 students Monday as they stepped up the 
investigation into the poisoning of a Antelope Valley high school teacher who 
became violently ill after she took a drink from a Diet Pepsi can laced with 
toxic dry-eraser fluid. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're interviewing any and all students . . . to determine who did this," 
Littlerock High School Principal Jeffery E. Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
 No suspects were arrested Monday in connection with the Thursday incident, but 
Foster said a $200 reward offered to students last week for information leading 
to the arrest and successful prosecution of the culprit generated several solid 
leads. He declined to elaborate. "I am cautiously optimistic that we're closing 
in," Foster said. "We have several students we are centering our investigation 
around right now."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VENICE PATROLS 
INCREASED AFTER WEEKEND SHOOTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police stepped up patrols in and around Venice on Monday after a spate of 
weekend shootings left two people dead and four injured -- among them an actor 
who portrayed a gang leader in the movie "South Central." 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Byron Keith Minns, 23, was one of four people wounded in back-to-back 
drive-by shootings Sunday night in Venice. Earlier in the weekend, two people 
were fatally shot in Venice and Mar Vista in attacks that police said appeared 
gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 A police spokesman said Monday it was unclear whether the incidents Sunday 
night were related to the earlier shootings. But additional police were 
deployed amid fears that the shootings may signal the resumption of a local 
gang war that had quieted for several months. 
</P>
<P>
 Minns, of Van Nuys, was in good condition at UCLA Medical Center with bullet 
wounds to the arm, back and abdomen, a hospital spokeswoman said. Minns 
portrayed the founder of a street gang in the 1992 film produced by Oliver 
Stone. Minns also had a role in the recently released "Above the Rim," about a 
basketball player trying to escape life in the slums. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the four victims in Sunday night's drive-by incidents were affiliated 
with gangs, and police had no motive for the attacks, which occurred minutes 
apart at the edge of Marina del Rey. Both attacks were believed carried out by 
the same carload of three men. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm willing to bet that those three suspects who shot (Minns) had no idea who 
he was," said Lt. Otis Dobine of the Los Angeles Police Department's Pacific 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before 10 p.m. Sunday, the attackers pulled alongside a car at Venice 
and Abbot Kinney boulevards and shot the two occupants several times, Dobine 
said. Marquis Cooley, 20, was listed in critical condition at UCLA with a wound 
to the lung. Tonika Grant, 23, was treated and released from a Kaiser 
Permanente facility on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunmen drove a mile east to Lincoln and Washington boulevards and opened 
fire as Minns was leaving a music store, Dobine said. Another pedestrian, 
identified as Abelardo Lopez, 37, was hit several times. He was listed in 
critical condition Monday at UCLA with wounds to the face and jaw. 
</P>
<P>
 The attackers' vehicle was described as a light-colored 1970s Chevrolet Camaro 
or Pontiac Firebird. The gunmen were described as Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Sunday morning, Manuel Hernandez, 18, was shot dead outside a party at a 
Mar Vista housing project. Mario Lopez, said to be in his early 20s, was shot 
and killed early Saturday in the Oakwood section of Venice. KEN ELLINGWOOD

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: JACK-OF-ALL-TRADES 
MAYOR LEARNS CITY FROM BOTTOM UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan has been moonlighting. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last several months, the mayor has been skipping out of his City Hall 
office to collect trash in El Sereno, check out library books in Baldwin Hills, 
inspect earthquake-damaged buildings in Van Nuys and pave a road in Echo Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Conducted behind the scenes with little fanfare, Riordan's days out of the 
office are designed to teach him about the city's massive bureaucracy -- 
without any reporters around to distract him. He says he wants to observe the 
work environment as it is without a mayor around. 
</P>
<P>
 Early one morning last month, the millionaire attorney and venture capitalist 
went out with a sanitation crew and learned about mechanized garbage 
collection. With driver Stanley Hannah and loader Louis Sepulveda as his 
guides, Riordan pushed dumpsters to the back of the truck and learned to scoop 
up the trash and crush it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just showed up here one morning," said Lou Baez, superintendent of the 
sanitation yard. "No one knew. We made him sign for his gloves and safety 
glasses and away he went." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan has also made a street sign, fixed the time clock in a parking meter 
and read a story to children in an after-school program. In Echo Park, he paved 
the curb lane of Glendale Boulevard from the Union 76 gas station north through 
the Montana Street intersection. (The roadway appears fine but Riordan tracked 
asphalt on the carpet of the mayor's suite.) 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan says he has handled all the tasks that have been thrown at him, 
although with differing degrees of success. 
</P>
<P>
 He had some trouble figuring out the various levers on the garbage truck 
during his two-hour trash collecting stint and doubts that his crew would want 
him around full time. As for shelving library books at the Baldwin Hills 
branch, Riordan acknowledges that he might have made a mistake or two. MARC

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY; CAMPING TRIP IN 
EXCHANGE FOR HARD WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The National Park Service is offering a free weekend camping trip this month 
at the recently dedicated Palo Comado Canyon.  
</P>
<P>
 There's only one catch: It's free for those who volunteer to work both weekend 
days to widen, fill and repair hiking and biking trails, help remove old fences 
and put up trail signs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Park Service and the Concerned Off Road Bicyclists Assn. (CORBA) are 
asking nature lovers to help work on trails at the 2,329 acres formerly known 
as Jordan Ranch and at the abutting Cheeseboro Canyon Park, which covers 
another 2,147 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Park Service bought Palo Comado Canyon from entertainer Bob Hope 
last June for $16.7 million after a battle over a 750-home development and golf 
course planned for the site. The canyon has been open to the public since 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteer work weekend is scheduled for April 23 and 24. Trail work starts 
at 8:30 a.m. both days and volunteers should be at the site no later than 8:15 
a.m., said Jean Bray, spokeswoman for the Santa Monica Mountains National 
Recreation Area, a unit of the national parks system. 
</P>
<P>
 Bray encourages people to go out and experience the national parklands this 
time of year, and do a little hard work while they're out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is so green and lush and beautiful right now," Bray said. 
"Everybody that goes out there has a great time. There's a lot of sweating 
because it is hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 Bray hopes that between 100 and 200 volunteers help out during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more the better, so we'll be able to finish the work sooner," she said. 
"A comment I hear from a lot of the workers is they want to give back to the 
park for the ability to recreate in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers can work either day or both. Camping at the old Palo Comado 
caretaker's area is free for those who work both days. A barbecue will be held 
Saturday after trail work and a program about the canyon is set for 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers should register ahead of time and should bring gloves, sturdy 
shoes, lunch and camping equipment if they plan to stay overnight. Drinking 
water will be provided. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on trail work, call (818) 773-3555. For information on 
camping or the barbecue, which costs $8.50, send your name, telephone number 
and whether you want to camp or attend the barbecue, to: CORBA, 1 Clipper Road 
B, Rancho Palos Verdes, CA 90274, or fax the information to (818) 591-9029.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; DEPUTY 
ACCUSED OF PERJURY WITHDRAWS PLEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A suspended sheriff's deputy withdrew his no contest plea to three counts of 
perjury Monday, just as he was about to be sentenced.  
</P>
<P>
 Glen Cozart, 33, had pleaded no contest to partial charges against him March 
7, but Superior Court Judge Florence-Marie Cooper insisted that he change his 
plea to guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Although legally the two pleas are the same, Cozart refused, withdrawing his 
plea and putting the case back at "square one," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan 
Steinfeld. Cooper had indicated earlier that she would grant probation to 
Cozart, a 10-year department veteran who faced a four-year prison term.  
</P>
<P>
 The former training officer at the Temple City sheriff's station was indicted 
on 13 counts last year. The remaining charges against him were expected to be 
dismissed at Monday's sentencing hearing. Instead, Cozart will return to court 
May 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Cozart's attorney, Franklin Peters, could not be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors allege that Cozart, who has been suspended without pay since 
September, 1991, planted evidence on two suspects to support his causes for 
their arrest, then lied under oath at another suspect's preliminary hearing.

POLICE SEEK WOMAN IN DRUG INJECTION DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police on Monday were seeking a Reseda woman who they believe administered a 
fatal drug injection to an ailing man while allegedly practicing medicine 
illegally from her home. 
</P>
<P>
 Refugio Sandoval, 60, was sought in the death of Jesus Nicolas Anchondo, 22, 
of Arleta, who police say died Sunday after getting an injection from Sandoval 
about 11 a.m. After going into convulsions, he was taken to Northridge Hospital 
Medical Center, where he died at noon, a hospital spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities want to question Sandoval and said they were considering whether 
to seek an arrest warrant on charges of manslaughter and practicing medicine 
without a license. They said she apparently had a large clientele, and had been 
treating patients for a variety of ailments for at least five years. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those patients was Anchondo's mother, who told authorities she had 
taken her son to see Sandoval after he began vomiting and complained of 
flu-like symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time detectives arrived at Sandoval's Reseda home after Anchondo's 
death, she had fled, and by nightfall, her seven adult children also were gone, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 But inside the ramshackle, one-story stucco house, authorities said they found 
what looked like a pharmacy and doctor's office, complete with rows upon rows 
of medications, and a line of chairs that they believe was Sandoval's waiting 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no evidence that Sandoval had any actual medical training," Detective 
Rick Swanston said. "We don't know much about her yet. She tells people she is 
a nurse, but we have not been able to find any proof of that yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Swanston said police have information indicating that Sandoval got her 
medications in Tijuana, and that she was providing medical care to a steady 
clientele through word of mouth. "She had a lot of patients, we're sure of 
that," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of Anchondo's death, Swanston said, police seized "tons of stuff, 
thousands and thousands of pills and vials of medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 "She had everything in the world, hundreds of drugs in there," he said. "She 
had a miniature hospital in her bedroom." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the medicines were labeled in Spanish, including a vial that appeared 
to contain the fluid that was injected into Anchondo, and that authorities were 
trying to determine its contents.  
</P>
<P>
 Neither Swanston nor the Los Angeles County coroner's office would speculate 
on what was in the vial. Scott Carrier, a coroner's spokesman, said an autopsy 
on Anchondo is scheduled today. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said they had seen a steady stream of people coming and going to 
Sandoval's house. At least two neighbors said people had come to their door, 
asking for the house number where Sandoval lived, or simply asking for "the 
nurse." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities and medical experts say practicing medicine without a license is a 
common occurrence in some Latino communities in Southern California, where 
drugs and medications can be bought at swap meets and other black-market 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Valderrama, 25, lived across the street, and said he frequently wondered 
whether all the traffic was because of some kind of illicit activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every night there'd be a few different cars," he said. "But if you did think 
they were doing something illegal, you'd never think it was alternative 
medicine. That's the last thing you'd expect."

2,000 AT MEMORIAL FOR DISNEY'S WELLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 2,000 people packed into a sound stage on the lot of Walt Disney 
Studios in Burbank on Monday afternoon to pay a final tribute to company 
President Frank G. Wells, who was killed April 3 in a helicopter crash while on 
a ski trip. 
</P>
<P>
 During the three-hour memorial, a studio orchestra played some of Wells' 
favorite songs from the studio's animated features, a choir from First African 
Methodist Episcopal Church sang and several colleagues, close friends and 
family members -- sometimes choking back emotion -- eulogized Wells. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Eisner, Disney's chief executive officer, introduced the many 
speakers. "If we'd invited everyone, this tribute would have gone through the 
night and beyond," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner said that the Friday before Wells' death "Frank was in a great frame of 
mind" because he had just decided to sign another seven-year contract to stay 
with the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells and Eisner took the reins at Disney 10 years ago and are credited with 
turning the studio around, both financially and creatively. 
</P>
<P>
 The program included a slide presentation that showed Wells' many facets, from 
influential businessman and community leader to adventurous outdoorsman. He 
quit as Warner Bros. president in 1982 to scale the highest summits on each 
continent and failed only to reach the top of Mt. Everest. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor-director Clint Eastwood, a friend and business associate, remembered the 
time when he and Wells were at odds over a point in a movie deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's play tennis for it," Eastwood remembered suggesting. 
</P>
<P>
 "His eyes narrowed and his eyes squinted, even more than me," said Eastwood, 
whose trademark squint is legendary. "I knew that I was in for the tennis match 
of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Eastwood had accompanied Wells on the ski trip to Nevada's Ruby Mountains but 
had left for his Carmel home about an hour before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll go on other adventures, but it won't be quite the same. I'll miss you, 
pal," Eastwood said as he left the podium. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying skis onto the stage, Wells' son, Briant, also addressed the crowd, 
asking them to join in singing with him "Hey Jude," a Beatles song that Wells 
loved to sing. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Disney, actor Robert Redford, actress Candice Bergen and several other of 
Wells' close friends from the entertainment industry spoke at the memorial, as 
did Warren Miller, a documentary filmmaker and one of Wells' ski partners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see him standing on the summit," said Miller, choking back tears, 
"saying, 'C'mon you guys, hurry up. This powder snow won't last forever.' 
</P>
<P>
 "You're wrong, Frank. It will."

 Lawyers for the city neared the end of their defense in the Rodney G. King 
lawsuit Monday, calling a flurry of witnesses who testified that King's 
injuries are overstated and that he enjoys a certain celebrity status from his 
run-in with the law three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. David J. Paster, former head of psychiatry at St. John's Hospital in Santa 
Monica, said King did not suffer from psychological trauma as a result of his 
beating by police officers in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was raised as a child to be very strong mentally and not to give in," said 
Paster, one of several doctors called to testify for the city and the 15 
present and former police officers named as defendants in King's 
multimillion-dollar civil lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical experts who testified for King said he suffers from permanent brain 
damage, blurred vision, headaches and loss of concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Loncaric, who had seen King in public, was called by defense 
attorneys to counter claims that King suffers from fear of leaving his house. 
Loncaric said she saw King at a Lakers basketball game in March, 1993, signing 
autographs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He seemed completely relaxed and at ease," she said, adding that she observed 
him smiling and drinking beers. 
</P>
<P>
 Milton Grimes, King's attorney, said he attended the game with King and two 
bodyguards. 
</P>
<P>
 On cross-examination, Loncaric conceded that she could not see King's face 
clearly and that she was not sure he was drinking beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, defense attorneys told U.S. District Judge John G. Davies they would 
wrap up their case in the trial's first phase today with an economist as their 
final witness. King's attorneys said they plan to call at least two doctors and 
an audio expert as rebuttal witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 After the trial's first phase, the 10-member jury will decide compensatory 
damages King will be paid by the city, which has accepted responsibility for 
his injuries. King asked for $9.6 million and rejected a city offer to settle 
the case for $1.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 After compensatory damages are determined, a second phase will determine 
whether individual police officers and other defendants must pay punitive 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Four officers were tried for King's beating and acquitted in a state trial, 
sparking three days of rioting in 1992. Laurence M. Powell and Stacey C. Koon 
were later convicted of violating King's civil rights and are serving 30-month 
sentences in federal prison.

 Trade ministers from 116 nations that took part in the talks, known as the

ENVIRONMENT; WHO CAN BRITONS TRUST WITH THEIR NATIONAL TREASURES?; CRITICS SAY 
TOO MANY VISITORS SPOIL THE SITES AND FOSTER COMMERCIALISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Britain is a treasure house of historical buildings, monuments and 
archeological sites, and the National Trust, which celebrates its centenary 
next year, holds the key to many of them. 
</P>
<P>
 But the National Trust and other organizations in the "heritage industry" face 
a problem that also confronts the U.S. national park system: Where to draw the 
line between visitor access and preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Easier access means ever more tourists and the need to accommodate them with 
an infrastructure of services that often intrude on the beauty of the 
attraction. Some critics, such as architectural expert Colin Amery, grumble 
that too many of Britain's treasures have been unnecessarily "tarted up" to 
please a public that is more interested in the on-site tearooms and shops than 
in the attraction itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in danger of turning our heritage into one vast theme park," says 
Amery, who writes for the Financial Times. "But I suppose that's because the 
heritage industry is one of our few growth industries. We don't make anything 
anymore in Britain. We just show visitors our past." 
</P>
<P>
 And Peter Jackson, a member of the National Trust's ruling council, complains 
that some of the visitors' facilities "cost a fortune," which might be better 
spent buying or maintaining historic properties. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had it to do over again," Jackson adds, "I think I would oppose some of 
the more elaborate facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Other critics suggest that some of the National Trust's most popular 
properties are beginning to resemble Alton Towers, a well-known amusement park, 
in terms of their operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty -- 
National Trust, for short -- is Britain's largest charitable institution, and 
now has more than 2 million members who support it. It is the largest landowner 
in Britain with 573,000 acres -- hill, dale, lake, forest, inland waterways, 
seacoast, nature reserves, even villages -- Lacock in Wiltshire and West 
Wycombe in Buckinghamshire -- belonging to the Trust in perpetuity and open to 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trust also owns an estimated 40,000 archeological sites including 
prehistoric and Roman antiquities. Among its properties is part of Roman 
Emperor Hadrian's Wall across northern Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Most visible are its more than 200 historic buildings, open to visitors, 
including castles and abbeys, barns, mills and stately homes. To administer and 
care for the properties, the Trust employs about 3,000 salaried staff members 
and relies on 25,000 volunteers as wardens, accountants, surveyors, gamekeepers 
and guides. 
</P>
<P>
 And catering to visitors, the National Trust provides parking lots, 
information centers, more than 200 shops, restaurants, 128 tea rooms, 
lavatories and other facilities, including 200 holiday cottages. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lies the problem. Is more money devoted to the ancillary facilities 
than to the main attraction. Or as a close observer of the operations put it: 
"Some believe the Trust has become too large, too unwieldy and too commercial." 
</P>
<P>
 There is, in fact, an organization called National Trust Enterprises which is 
responsible for commercial operations. Its main activities are retailing in 
shops at the properties and in independent town shops; serving in restaurants, 
tearooms and refreshment kiosks and the letting of holiday cottages. 
</P>
<P>
 These activities provide operating capital for the fund's more traditional 
obligations, officials say. Less than half of its annual budget comes from 
subscriptions, gifts and legacies; National Trust Enterprises comes up with the 
rest, more than $10 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But local residents complain when the Trust sets up tourist centers in towns 
near historic attractions, such as the plan to build one near Snowshill Manor, 
in the heart of the Cotswolds. 
</P>
<P>
 Another criticism is that the Trust has overexpanded, acquiring more sites 
than it can afford to maintain properly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see why people would be upset about Britain being turned into a theme 
park," says Rodney Legg, a member of the Trust Council and chairman of the Open 
Spaces Society. "It will have a negative effect on Trust-giving. The Trust is 
becoming over-stretched. I wish we hadn't gone as far as we have with acquiring 
properties which need high revenue to keep them intact." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there's a compelling urge to preserve as much as possible of the 
historical symbols of this country with a passion for its past. Ten years ago, 
for instance, the Trust acquired Fountains Abbey in North Yorkshire, the site 
of the largest monastic ruin in Britain, which, together with its extensive 
gardens of Studley Royal, was subsequently designated a World Heritage Site by 
UNESCO. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of National Trust houses, many of the grand country manors, have 
associations with famous people -- for instance, Wimpole Hall, Cambridgeshire 
(Rudyard Kipling), Ayot St. Lawrence, Hertfordshire (George Bernard Shaw), 
Chartwell, Kent (Sir Winston Churchill), Washington Old Hall, Tyne and Wear 
County (the family of George Washington) and Cliveden (American-born Lady Nancy 
Astor). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In all, about 12 million people have visited National Trust properties, and 
countless more have enjoyed free access to the countryside and coastal areas 
owned by the Trust. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trust was founded in 1895 and given a mandate by Parliament in 1907 "to 
promote the permanent preservation for the benefit of the nation land and 
buildings of beauty or historic interest." Its properties can never be sold or 
mortgaged, nor acquired by public authorities, without the special consent of 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Another conservation organization, English Heritage, also acquires historic 
properties, particularly monuments, ancient and modern, as well as buildings of 
historic interest in and around London. English Heritage owns, among other 
sites, that heavily visited ancient structure of Stonehenge. 
</P>
<P>
 English Heritage is a quasi-governmental body, supported primarily by public 
funds voted annually by Parliament, whereas the National Trust is a charity 
primarily dependent on membership subscriptions and donations. In the United 
States, the National Trust maintains a branch called the Royal Oak Foundation, 
with 16,000 members who have contributed more than $1 million for the 
restoration of Trust properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics suggest that the National Trust should follow the lead of English 
Heritage, which -- under the chairmanship of the abrasive, dynamic, former 
publisher Jocelyn Stevens -- has begun to divest itself of some properties, 
turning them over to local government authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics liken English Heritage's divestiture policy to selling off the family 
silver, and the policy is also controversial because the local authorities, 
like a London borough, often do not have the resources -- or desire -- to 
supervise and protect local monuments or listed houses. Listed houses and 
buildings are those built between 1700 and 1940 that are considered of 
"exceptional" or "particular" national importance. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Trust itself often leases its lands and properties to others to 
manage, ranging from agricultural plots to the famous Cliveden house, leased to 
a hotel corporation to run as hostelry for the paying public -- with 37 double 
rooms at about $350 a night. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes leasing can run afoul of public opinion, as in the case where 
farmers permit fox or deer hunting on leased Trust lands. Peter Jackson, the 
National Trust council member, argues: "I think conducting blood sports on 
Trust land is a great mistake and is causing a lot of offense among our 
members." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As for commercialization, Colin Amery, the architectural expert, complains 
that some visitors prefer the shops to the attraction itself. "The National 
Trust is getting like Marks & Spencer (department store) with everything the 
same quality." 
</P>
<P>
 But a spokeswoman for the National Trust points out that visitors like and 
expect tearooms and restaurants. "We operate 128 tearooms and they are 
profitable, as are the souvenir shops," she says. "We are aware that there are 
ghastly souvenirs sold in this country, but we monitor what is sold under the 
National Trust logo very carefully. We think they are in good taste. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basic problem is money: Once we received funds from generous donors and 
from rental of agricultural lands. But donations, rents and government grants 
are down, and costs are up." 
</P>
<P>
 National Trust official Caroline Audemars sums up: "We are trying to protect 
the Trust land and properties. We are trying to serve the public. We are trying 
to strike a proper balance between access and conservation. It's a huge 
responsibility."

THE WEEK AHEAD: TOKYO; MUBARAK TO ASIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is scheduled to arrive Monday on a weeklong 
visit to Japan and China in an attempt to bring the two Asian powerhouses into 
the Middle East peace fold, although the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa leaves in question who will greet him in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Mubarak's last trip to China was cut short more than a year ago by the major 
earthquake that struck Cairo. This time, Mubarak will be pushing his campaign 
for an end to weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East -- China is a 
supplier of missiles to the region -- and urging Japan to join in financial 
support for Palestinian self-rule in Jericho and the Gaza Strip.

THE WEEK AHEAD: MUSCAT; MIDEAST WATER TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israeli officials make their first in-person diplomatic venture into the heart 
of Arabia on Sunday when a delegation from Jerusalem flies to Oman to join 
multilateral talks on the issue of future water cooperation in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 Yossi Beilin, Israel's deputy foreign minister, will head the Israeli 
entourage to the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Middle East analysts say it is water that could produce the next big war in 
the region, and the Oman talks are one attempt to head off such a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation's trip marks the first time Israelis have been invited to visit 
the conservative Arabian peninsula region.

 National leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States will be in Moscow 
on Friday for a meeting on a proposed agreement that would strengthen economic 
ties between the 12 CIS countries -- all the former Soviet republics except the 
Baltic states -- followed by a discussion of military cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Beefing up the economic and military skeleton of the organization serves the 
interests of Russia, whose leading role has become even more pronounced since 
President Boris N. Yeltsin was appointed to a six-month term as CIS chairman at 
its summit in Turkmenistan last December. 
</P>
<P>
 Razing economic barriers within the Commonwealth means the smaller countries 
can look to Russia as a stable source of cheap energy -- a role it is ready to 
fulfill in return for extensive control over the other members' economic 
policies and some sort of security guarantee for ethnic Russian minorities in 
the CIS states.

 It's getting to be a habit with Japanese prime ministers -- Morihiro Hosokawa 
on Friday became the fourth of Tokyo's last five leaders to step down over 
allegations of political scandal or corruption -- and cartoonists must be 
straining to come up with new angles. But once again they caught the agony and 
embarrassment of a nation with trouble at the top.

CHANGING LIFESTYLES; SPRING BRINGS LITTLE HOPE TO BLOCKADED ARMENIANS; CAUGHT

 Four-year-old Maysik Shakhbazian was lying in bed with his grandmother one 
night and looking up at the bright full moon. As usual, there was no heat or 
light in the Yerevan apartment where he lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "See how pretty the moon is," his grandmother said. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, Maysik had an inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grandmother," he asked, "isn't there some way we could lay an electricity 
line to it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Maysik was not just fantasizing. He was imitating his elders, his young head 
already at work on how to ease his family's daily grind in a heatless, dim-lit, 
penny-poor world. 
</P>
<P>
 As Armenia has come through its third winter of misery into a tentative 
spring, inhabitants of the former Soviet republic seem to have reconciled 
themselves to the depressing prospect that more privations are all that awaits 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no end in sight to the war in Nagorno-Karabakh, the small Armenian 
enclave within Azerbaijan, nor to the hostility between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
That means there will be no lifting of the Azerbaijani blockade aimed at 
bringing Armenia's economy to its knees, particularly its energy sector. 
Turkey, Azerbaijan's ally, lets virtually no supplies through and Armenia's 
other neighbor, Georgia, is so anarchic that supply routes there are chancy at 
best. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many Yerevan residents who hoped initially that life would soon return to 
normal now believe that they will spend the next several winters without heat 
and light. Instead of looking forward to the end of this tunnel, they focus on 
coping, refining the art of survival in a world caught somewhere between the 
20th Century and the Middle Ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Maysik knew about electricity lines, for example, because of the widespread 
practice in Yerevan of stringing a line "on the left" between neighboring 
apartment houses. When the power company gives one apartment block its hour or 
two of electricity per day, friends in a neighboring house can siphon off some 
of the juice for themselves through a pirate line. Government workers come 
around tearing down the illegal lines periodically, but they soon sprout again. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they live in central Yerevan, a city of about 1 million residents, 
the Shakhbazians also have a wood-burning stove that has already turned their 
creamy new wallpaper a dingy gray. And they have a gasoline-powered generator 
that allows them to keep one light and a television -- a small one, the big one 
takes too much power -- running in the evenings. 
</P>
<P>
 Their neighbor, Lilia Azatian, 52, is not so lucky. She comes by once or twice 
a week to escape reality by watching American soap operas on the Shakhbazians' 
little television because she has no generator and no illegal line at home. 
</P>
<P>
 A doctor who has done administrative work for the last two decades, Azatian 
heated her home this winter mainly by burning unneeded documents from work. She 
and her two grown children, a 22-year-old daughter and 24-year-old son, all 
slept in the same big bed for warmth. Her ailing mother also slept in the same 
room, near the stove.  
</P>
<P>
 "We don't manage, we just exist," Azatian said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Armenian government, adjusting to its chronic energy crisis, managed to 
prepare special fuel supplies this winter for hospitals, bakeries, 
communications centers and other strategic facilities. It also hopes to restart 
Armenia's nuclear power plant within the next year. It was shut down in 1989 
for safety concerns. But for now, most individuals are on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "My salary is enough for one pound of cheese," Azatian calculated. "I've 
hoarded everything from the past -- oil, soap, toilet paper, napkins -- and the 
consignment store helps. I've sold crystal glasses and some plates," as well as 
some of her clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 This winter, the Azatians chopped up and burned a desk and a chest. Last 
winter, they fed a sofa to the wood stove. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I'm gathering paper again for next year," Azatian said. "The situation 
probably won't change." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to a report by the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, Armenian households were caught even less prepared for winter this 
year than last. The median amount of food stores was 30% lower compared to the 
year before, although very little serious malnutrition has shown up. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important coping method among households during last winter was 
sharing available resources with relatives, friends and neighbors," the report 
said. But this winter, it said, resources were so tight there was far less to 
share. 
</P>
<P>
 The average stores of food, it found, were about 15 pounds of flour per 
household, less than half what they were in the winter of 1992-1993. Subsidized 
bread is rationed at about half a loaf daily per person -- although more is 
available at market price.  
</P>
<P>
 The shortages of everything have spawned a Yerevan joke that if a guest comes 
to your home uninvited, he's considered a racketeer; if you've offered an 
invitation, it's considered humanitarian aid. Humanitarian groups provide some 
fuel and food, with millions of dollars worth of kerosene funded by the U.S. 
government and the United Armenia Fund, but families like Azatian's do not 
qualify for much of it -- she is considered well-off compared to elderly people 
without families and single mothers of young children. Gift packages from 
relatives abroad help a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the Soviet period, the greatest shortage of all is money -- the 
new Armenian currency known as the dram, exchanged at about 200 to the dollar. 
Maysik's mother is still on extended maternity leave after giving birth to his 
younger sister and is expected to make ends meet on a government maternity 
payment of 100 drams -- 50 cents -- a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's a hundred drams -- that's what my mother gets for her monthly 
pension," said Samvel Hovannisian, a cousin visiting the Shakhbazians. "A pack 
of cigarettes costs more than that." 
</P>
<P>
 But his mother gets by, Hovannisian said, because he supports her with his 
business earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 And that, said Maysik's grandfather, Martin, is how it is done: "You either do 
business or sell what's at home." 
</P>
<P>
 One family of the Shakhbazians' acquaintance is doing business on just $100 -- 
they lend the money out repeatedly and live on the interest. Others try to 
import candy bars or cigarettes or whatever they can, but the market is weak -- 
the CDC said 94% of the population is considered below the international 
poverty line.  
</P>
<P>
 Still -- the Shakhbazians say, sighing -- they do have each other.  
</P>
<P>
 "We just get together and talk and that's our main happiness," Azatian said. 
No one goes to the theater anymore, or the movies or restaurants -- but they 
still have the entertainment they make for themselves, even if it is only 
sitting around discussing their misery. And an unsinkable sense of humor -- 
with jokes stemming even from the cold darkness of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Winters have become so miserable, Maysik's grandfather, Martin, said, that 
they have spawned a new saying: "You count your chicks in the fall, to see 
which have survived, and you count Armenians in the spring."

NEXT STEP; HEALING BRAZIL; INFLATION, POVERTY AND CHAOS CONFRONT THE NATION'S 
NEXT LEADER. BUT TWO MEN ARE EAGER FOR THE JOB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In giant Brazil, problems come big. 
</P>
<P>
 Latin America's largest country suffers the longest-running streak of 
super-inflation ever known, a decade of annual percentage increases in the 
hundred- and thousand-fold. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past 18 months, a president has been toppled and a congressional 
"budget mafia" has been exposed in back-to-back scandals revealing corruption 
to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Social problems are overwhelming. An estimated 32 million of Brazil's 155 
million people have incomes so small that they cannot afford proper 
nourishment. Public education and health systems are in shambles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brazil is in a state of abandon," said economist Salomao Quadros da Silva of 
the Getulio Vargas Foundation here. "The government is incapacitated." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-seven million Brazilians live in two overcrowded and violent 
metropolitan areas -- Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro -- where powerful criminal 
gangs steal and kill almost at will and rogue cops are equally dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Despair is pervasive and deep. Joao Ubaldo Ribeiro, one of Brazil's leading 
novelists, wrote recently that the country seems to have become "a Babel that 
is more and more out of control, where no one is sure of anything, where no one 
trusts anything and the norms that should regulate our lives change 
constantly." 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1994, Brazil has an opportunity to try to reverse its fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an election year, and Brazilians are looking for a president who can 
lead them out of the morass. They could also throw the rascals out of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 As the campaign gets under way, the current government is pressing forward 
with an economic stabilization plan designed to curb inflation now rocketing in 
the range of 45% a month, or more than 8,000% a year. Meanwhile, 
non-governmental groups are mobilizing to tackle social problems. 
</P>
<P>
 So, amid the gloom, there are glimmerings of hope, however tentative. This 
could turn out to be a year of potentially momentous change, Brazilian 
political and economic analysts say. "Or disaster," said one. "You never know 
which way Brazil is going to go." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Go back to the early 1970s for a glance at Brazil in its "miracle" era. The 
economy was booming; there was "order and progress," as prescribed by the motto 
on the national flag. The country's can-do optimism knew no bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brazilian economy became the 10th largest in the world. Today, despite its 
economic ills, Brazil manufactures more than 1.3 million motor vehicles a year, 
exports turboprop airliners and is well on its way to launching rockets that 
can put its own satellites in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil's big ambitions were and still are backed by a solid industrial base, 
the world's fifth-largest population and the rich resources of a territory 
bigger than the United States without Alaska. But somehow, greatness has eluded 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Go back to 1985 for a glance at Brazil as it returned to civilian government 
after 21 years of military rule. The military regime had fizzled out amid a 
debt crisis, growing inflation and political unrest. No one any longer believed 
in "miracles" of development. Democracy, however, shone with promise. Many 
Brazilians hoped it could solve the country's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In the nine years since, under three civilian presidents, that hope has 
flickered on and off, colored by progressively deeper pessimism. In different 
ways, civilian Presidents Jose Sarney, Fernando Collor de Mello and Itamar 
Franco (whose term ends at the beginning of 1995) all have delivered bitter 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Who can fix Brazil? As the country casts about for an answer, two names stand 
out: Luis Inacio Lula da Silva and Fernando Henrique Cardoso. 
</P>
<P>
 Lula is a former metalworker and union leader who has no formal education 
beyond the sixth grade. A moderate socialist, he leads the labor-based Workers' 
Party, which includes an important faction of doctrinaire Marxists. As the 
runner-up candidate in 1989 runoff elections, Lula won 31 million votes to 
Collor's 35 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, Lula has been trying to broaden his political base. He and other party 
moderates seek to reassure business people and military officers that their 
plans include nothing like the late Chilean President Salvador Allende's 
ill-fated drive toward socialism in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 And although Brazil's military leadership is conservative, many officers share 
Lula's nationalist tendencies and his fondness for state enterprises. "Lula 
already has the simpatia -- or at least the tolerance -- of important sectors 
of the armed forces," said the magazine Istoe. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoso is a former sociology professor who has found a second vocation in 
politics as a founder and leader of the Brazilian Party of Social Democracy. He 
was a popular senator until joining President Franco's Cabinet -- first as 
foreign minister, then as finance minister. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 11 months as finance minister, Cardoso failed to stop the dizzying 
flight of inflation, which rose from about 30% to nearly 45% a month on his 
watch. But he won congressional and public support for a plan that economists 
say has a chance of stabilizing prices, at least temporarily, before the first 
round of elections Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say Lula may soon be running scared. At any rate, the 30% preference 
rate that he was getting before Cardoso announced should not be interpreted as 
putting the Workers' Party on the threshold of presidential power. It could 
mean that 70% think someone other than Lula should be president. Many of those 
who see Lula as the candidate to beat may also see Cardoso as the one to do it. 
Cardoso has the potential to dominate the center and right of the political 
spectrum, leaving Lula isolated on the left. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That clearly is Cardoso's intention. He asked rhetorically the other day 
whether the Workers' Party platform was aimed at making Brazil "a big 
Nicaragua? A Cuba?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lula, fighting to expand his share of the spectrum, accused Cardoso of 
furthering conservative market policies that are turning Brazil into "an 
Ethiopia or a Somalia." 
</P>
<P>
 If the economic stabilization plan Cardoso left in place as finance minister 
succeeds in curtailing inflation before the elections, he may get a bonanza of 
credit at the polls. But the plan is not foolproof. It includes a very complex 
and difficult switch from Brazil's inflationary currency to a new one. 
Economist Paulo Robelo de Castro says the switch will be "like changing the 
turbine of a Boeing while it's flying." 
</P>
<P>
 If the plan doesn't work, whoever is elected Brazil's next president will be 
back to square one on inflation. Economist De Castro warned that if the future 
president-elect does not inspire the confidence of Brazilians, especially the 
business sector, Brazil could face hyper-inflation, a chaotic condition in 
which prices soar completely out of control and money becomes virtually 
useless. 
</P>
<P>
 Former President Sarney's term ended in March, 1990, with inflation exploding 
at a rate of 80% a month, close to hyper-inflation. Former President Collor 
temporarily controlled inflation with a radical stabilization plan, but prices 
were shooting up again when Congress impeached and suspended him on corruption 
charges in 1992. Franco, who has been criticized widely as an indecisive and 
ineffectual leader since he replaced Collor, has had no success against 
inflation so far. 
</P>
<P>
 As corruption scandals and inflation battered the country during the latter 
months of 1993, the press fluttered with rumors that Franco would resign or 
that a coup was coming. In November, Franco told the Jornal do Brasil that he 
had received about 20 letters from the public asking him to shut down the 
Congress. But he said his democratic principles barred him from a 
"Fujimorization" -- a reference to the 1992 shutdown of the Peruvian Congress 
by President Alberto Fujimori. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The armed forces are in a negative mood, not only because of corruption 
scandals and economic crisis but also because they consider their own salaries 
to be insultingly low. But political analysts say no significant segment of 
Brazil's army or body politic wants a coup. "There is no danger of 
Fujimorization in Brazil," Gen. Zenildo Lucena, Franco's army minister, 
remarked recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, military leaders have not hidden their concern over the latest 
corruption scandal in Congress. In January, a special congressional committee 
recommended that 17 members of the lower chamber and one senator be expelled 
for participating in a network that manipulated federal budget funds in 
exchange for bribes and kickbacks. Four of the accused congressmen have 
resigned, and the rest are to be tried in Congress starting this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Few Brazilians believe that the 18 on the carpet are the only corrupt members 
of Congress. And the scandal is only the latest of a series. Another focuses on 
corrupt practices in the social security system. Crooked officials and judges 
have siphoned off an estimated $1.5 billion a year in fraudulent pensions and 
other payments, according to an official investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Even soccer, the national sport, is not sacred. In this World Cup year when 
the Brazilians are expected to contend for the championship in Southern 
California, the game has been tainted. Referees have accused the president of 
Rio's soccer federation of asking them to fix results. 
</P>
<P>
 Widespread as it is, the problem of corruption is not as painful for most 
Brazilians as inflation, which saps the purchasing power of the country's 
hard-pressed masses. Last year it reached a rate of 2,567%. Every few years, 
Brazil has to knock three zeros off its currency to keep calculators from going 
haywire with all the digits. Economist De Castro asked a young colleague to 
calculate compounded inflation since 1970, and the computer yielded a figure 
with 14 digits: 27 trillion percent. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil's corruption and inflation problems have political roots, and the 
political problems go deep into the country's historical subsoil. Brazil was 
the last Western country to abolish slavery -- in 1888 -- and the legacy from 
that relatively recent scourge has strongly and negatively influenced the 
country's economic and social development during the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "We waited until the last minute and then we just freed the slaves and told 
them they were free to survive on their own with no education, no resources, no 
nothing," said political scientist Amaury de Souza. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The society remains deeply divided. The dominant elite has give little thought 
or resources to improving health, education or criminal justice for the poor. 
Said De Souza: "We still have the mentality of slave owners." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent study by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, a 
government agency, drew a tragic map of Brazil's misery. It said the average 
monthly salary is $264. Nearly one-fifth of all workers earn less than the 
mandatory monthly minimum of $64. On average, black Brazilians earn less than 
half has much as whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributing to poverty is a public education system that severely limits 
upward mobility for the uneducated poor. All but 2% of Brazil's pupils repeat 
at least a year before completing eighth grade. About 66% drop out before 
eighth grade, and 2.6 million children of school age have never enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime thrives in ignorance and poverty. Drug-trafficking gangs control most of 
Rio's famous favela slums, often engaging in deadly gun battles for turf or to 
keep police out. In the worst recent shootout, 12 people were killed in a fight 
between gangs in the Acari shantytown. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime breeds more crime, and many of the victims are children and adolescents. 
The U.S.-based group Human Rights Watch said in a report this year that 5,644 
Brazilian children between 5 and 17 years old were slain from 1988 to 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those killed were abandoned children, "street kids," and many of their 
killers were police officers working with death squads. In the past three 
years, about 200 police officers have been detained for suspected death squad 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Such killings, a brutal reaction to burglary and theft by poor youths, is 
common in many cities. In early March, an advertising periodical called Hot 
List in the southern city of Londrina published an ad urging readers to "kill a 
juvenile delinquent." The ad was signed "Victimized Merchants." 
</P>
<P>
 One saving grace in recent years of government failure is the phenomenal 
growth of non-governmental organizations that care for street children, defend 
the Amazon wilderness, fight AIDS and other diseases, teach literacy and advise 
poor mothers. At last count, there were more than 5,000 of such groups, double 
the number of just two years before. An estimated 80,000 Brazilians participate 
in the groups. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Herbert de Souza, a social activist, has received a Nobel Prize nomination for 
leading a national "Campaign Against Hunger and Misery" to collect money and 
distribute food to an estimated 32 million Brazilians who cannot afford the 
nourishment they need. About 3,500 citizens committees around the country are 
participating in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Historian Jose Murilo de Carvalho, a researcher with the Getulio Vargas 
Foundation, said Brazil's biggest hope for salvation is the gradual perfection 
of its ill-formed and dysfunctional democratic system, which first opened up to 
mass participation only in 1945. Earlier in the century, only about 5% of the 
population voted. 
</P>
<P>
 So Brazil has had very little time to learn the "ethos of democracy," a 
process that took centuries in Europe, he said. "The goal is to gain time, to 
avoid any breakdown of the institutional rules, to keep learning." Out of

CULTURE; RAIN OR SHINE, GERMANS ARE DETERMINED TO TAN; FORGET WARNINGS ABOUT

 On a wet and gray March afternoon, with summer still seemingly light-years 
away, Gabriele Hagend climbed onto a glowing, violet sun bed and rose 21 
minutes later with a summer tan and tremendous "sense of well-being." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at her pink cheeks, one could hardly tell that she had spent the 
entire day in an office, the entire winter in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to look like I'm baked, but it's quite nice to have a tan all 
the time," the 31-year-old wholesale trader said. "Especially when spring 
comes, with short pants and skirts. It looks better when your legs are not like 
cheese sticks." 
</P>
<P>
 In the land of the pale, brown is beautiful. And in a sunless land, 
sun-worshipers abound. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 10 million Germans regularly visit tanning studios, and millions 
travel south each year to places where the sun is always brighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the worst recession since World War II, Germans are spending about $38 
billion a year on foreign travel -- more than any other country -- and their 
No. 1 priority for a good vacation is good sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain, Italy, Cyprus, the Canary Islands. Most Germans get six weeks of 
vacation a year, during which they crowd Spanish and Italian beaches now called 
"the Teutonic Grill." 
</P>
<P>
 In agricultural times, when most people labored outdoors, pale was pretty. 
Only poor farmers were tanned, while the bourgeoisie covered their heads and 
hands so that they would not be blemished by the sun, an unwanted symbol of the 
working class. 
</P>
<P>
 When industrialization took work indoors, however, suddenly it was the 
laborers who were pale-faced, and suntans were for the rich. A bronzed skin 
became a sign of leisure and wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Germans say that salon tanning not only makes them look better, it makes 
them feel better. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanning is an antidote to week after week of gloomy winter. It is also a way 
to prepare for later vacations in the sun -- a kind of pre-cook. Christel 
Mampell, editor of Top Tan magazine, says there are about 5,500 tanning salons 
throughout Germany and many more sun beds at hotels and sport centers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Sonnen Garten -- one of at least 50 sun studios in the Bonn area -- 40 
to 50 customers a day take off their clothes and lie down for about 15 minutes 
on a futuristic bed of ultra-violet bulbs that looks like a cross between a 
waffle iron and a plastic coffin. They pay about $5 to $9 for the privilege and 
for a seamless 360-degree tan. No truck driver tans. No unsightly bathing suit 
marks. No white butts. 
</P>
<P>
 This possibly matters more to Germans, who find nudity inoffensive and, 
consequently, spend a good bit more time naked in public than your average 
American. In summer, it is not uncommon to see men and women sunbathing in the 
buff in city parks. Most saunas are coed and clotheless, as are some swimming 
pools and beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tan-now, pay-later health warnings don't get a big reception among the 
regulars. 
</P>
<P>
 Shopkeeper Beate Griesenbach waves a post-tanning cigarette at the Sonnen 
Garten and says, "When you smoke as much as I do, you don't have to worry about 
sun benches." 
</P>
<P>
 Office worker Ingrid Kraemer, emerging from a 20,000-watt turbo sun bed, adds, 
"With the hole in the ozone layer, the real sun is much worse." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, neither is too good. Tanned skin ages more quickly and is more prone 
to cancer, medical studies show. Sunburns are dangerous, especially in 
children. Doctors say the incidence of skin cancer is rapidly increasing in 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The national Commission of Early Detection and Prevention of Skin Cancer, a 
group of private and governmental medical leaders in Germany, plans a 
nationwide media campaign against sun bathing and sun studios beginning in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Eckhard Wilhelm Breitbart, a member of the commission, says a similar 
campaign in 1989 reduced the use of sun studios, but patronage rose again when 
the commission launched subsequent campaigns against outdoor sun bathing. 
</P>
<P>
 Breitbart said about 10 million of the 80 million Germans use ultra-violet sun 
beds. Because their danger has not been scientifically proven, Breitbart says, 
many ignore what to doctors seems obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have plenty of examples of people who use solar beds and have cancer. But 
there is no serious study that makes a clear correlation between sun beds and 
skin cancer because most people who use the sun beds also use the normal sun," 
Breitbart says. 
</P>
<P>
 One fifteen-minute sunning session every two weeks probably is not harmful, he 
says, but many people overdo it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Abusers are not hard to find. Trude Hoever, a 33-year-old housing broker, is 
thin, blonde and dark as leather. Despite her premature wrinkles and freckles, 
she says she tans three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always very pale and unhappy," Hoever says at the Ergoline Sonnencenter 
in St. Augustin. "I need the sun bank like other people need cigarettes. I 
don't need food, but I need my sun bank." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Germans need their travel. Neighborhood travel agencies are to 
Germany what fast-food restaurants are to the United States: Everywhere and 
crowded. Customers stand in line at travel agencies for help and handfuls of 
brochures showing blue skies, white beaches and tanned travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recession, "vacations are the last thing Germans would give up," says 
travel agent Marc Herberz at Reisebuero St. Augustin. "Sun means relaxing and 
getting away from what we have at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Away from the gray weather and pale skin. Or, as tanner Helmut Schramm says at 
the Ergoline Sonnencenter, away from gray moods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tanned people are better tempered," Herberz says.

CULTURE; MUSLIM SHRINE WILL SOON BE GOOD AS GOLD; A MASSIVE PROJECT TO GILD THE 
DOME OF THE ROCK HAS WEATHERED RIOTS AND POLITICAL DISPUTES, WITH HELP FROM 
KING HUSSEIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jordan's King Hussein had to sell off a London villa to do it. And a high-tech 
Northern Ireland firm had to work through more than a year of riots, curfews 
and religious clashes to complete what it calls the largest and most complex 
electroplating job of its kind ever attempted. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as 40 Palestinian and foreign workmen put the finishing golden touches on 
the ancient, 15-foot-high crescent moon that soon will grace again the top of 
the third-holiest site of Islam, one of the world's most ambitious religious 
renovation jobs is nearing completion. 
</P>
<P>
 Next Monday, in a ceremony in Amman, the capital of Jordan, far from the 5,000 
glittering new gold plates that adorn Jerusalem's ancient Dome of the Rock, 
King Hussein is scheduled to inaugurate the refurbished dome over the sacred 
shrine that Muslims believe marks the place -- the very rock -- where the 
Prophet Mohammed departed earth and ascended to Heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Jordan's Hashemite king, the official custodian of the Dome of 
the Rock and financier of its renovation, cannot travel to the site to 
commemorate or even gaze upon the product of his $8-million investment, says 
much about the tribulations and politics that have accompanied the restoration, 
problems rooted in the shrine's location. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dome and the adjacent Al Aqsa Mosque sit in the eye of a political storm 
that has raged for more than a quarter of a century around the most disputed 
piece of land in the disputed city of Jerusalem -- the place Israelis call the 
Temple Mount, and the Muslims call Haram-esh-Sherif. Jews hold holy the Western 
Wall, which delineates one side of the mount, as a remnant of the temple built 
by King Herod. 
</P>
<P>
 The Islamic shrines, which draw millions of Muslim worshipers each year, are, 
in fact, under Israeli occupation and control in the heart of the walled Old 
City that Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. It is land 
that the Israelis have vowed never to relinquish. But the land is also claimed 
by the Palestinians who lived in the area through a succession of regimes and 
administrations that ended with Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Through all the claims and counterclaims, King Hussein, who is believed by 
most Muslims to be a direct descendant of the Prophet, remains the uncontested 
custodian of the Rock, the Dome that covers it and Al Aqsa Mosque. And that is 
a role so important to the king that he sold off part of his family fortune to 
refurbish the treasures, and flatly refused a counter-bid to repair the leaking 
and sagging dome by King Fahd, ruler of oil-rich Saudi Arabia and custodian of 
Islam's two other holiest sites in Mecca and Medina. 
</P>
<P>
 Against this backdrop, Patrick O'Hare, a veteran of complex Middle East 
engineering projects, has successfully navigated through the politics of a city 
sacred to three religions. He is now nearing completion of a job he considers 
"the highlight of my career." 
</P>
<P>
 For O'Hare and his Belfast-based Mivan Overseas Ltd., replating the Dome of 
the Rock was not just another contract. It was a far greater challenge and far 
more rewarding, he said, than Mivan's last construction contract at Euro 
Disney. And far more meaningful than the construction of a full-sized replica 
of the Titanic that his company recently began. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even the three grand palaces O'Hare and his firm built for Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein came close, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The challenges of the Dome were largely technical. Never before, O'Hare said, 
has a fixed object as large as the Dome of the Rock ever been gold-plated in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 "The process has been used before -- there were a couple domes done like this 
in California -- but it had never been done on this scale before anywhere in 
the world," the engineer said with pride, as workmen in an adjacent pre-fab 
workshop at the foot of the monument touched up the golden crescent that will 
be reinstalled atop the dome on Inauguration Day. 
</P>
<P>
 To do the job, O'Hare's company imported two giant cranes, 190 pounds of gold, 
1,500 new brass sheets and 5,000 copper joints from Britain. Mivan also brought 
in timber from the West African country of Gambia to reconstruct the support 
structure under the dome. Workers imported and assembled on-site the 
sophisticated electroplating machinery that O'Hare said accomplished the task 
at the rate of 40-square-meters per day -- "I'd like to think it's a world 
record," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was in bad shape," O'Hare said of the dome, which was last restored not 
with gold plating but anodized aluminum in 1956. "The dome itself was leaking, 
and the lower structure was falling apart." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the greatest challenges was to make sure the dome wasn't too shiny. 
O'Hare said the king wanted a traditional look, a "relatively matte finish." 
Furthermore, the engineer explained, "if it were a really bright finish, it 
would be like a mirror off the sun. From a distance, it would look black." 
</P>
<P>
 As things turned out, the politics inherent in the site presented O'Hare and 
his workers with surprisingly few complications. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't caused us any major problems," he said of frequent protest strikes 
by Palestinian factions that have shut down most of East Jerusalem and the Old 
City for reasons unrelated to the work on the shrine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We normally work on the strike days, especially because of the nature of the 
project. They treat us very well. They give us special VIP treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, O'Hare added, for the first time in his life he has been stopped on 
the street and asked for his autograph, which he routinely signs as "Captain of 
the Dome Rockers." 
</P>
<P>
 The most memorable moment of the operation, O'Hare recalled, was when his team 
removed the canvas that veiled the dome during most of the restoration. "People 
started cheering," he said, "and it really was very moving." 
</P>
<P>
 Few are moved by the sight of the glowing new dome as regularly and as deeply 
as Sheikh Mohamed Hussein. He is the grand imam at the Dome of the Rock, and 
his office is just a few dozen yards from the shrine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely, it is a beautiful, positive feeling every morning I see it," he 
said. "It reminds me I am in al-Quds (the Arabic name for Jerusalem), and it 
reminds me that I am of Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very happy with this," the imam observed. "We are convinced that this 
particular plating is the very best money can buy." 
</P>
<P>
 And, he said, the work made no significant changes to a shrine that is "the 
only Islamic landmark that has remained virtually unchanged through all the 
centuries." It was completed in 691, about 60 years after the death of the 
Prophet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What has changed, though, are the political developments that have swirled 
around the shrine in the seven months since Israel and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization signed their historic declaration calling for Palestinian autonomy 
in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israelis and PLO leaders agreed to discuss the fate of the Old City, that 
ancient, walled part of Jerusalem that includes the Temple Mount and the 
Islamic shrines, over the next five years. In the meantime, the violence 
spawned by that political process have impacted on the Dome of the Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 The imam said security men have been forced to ban all non-Muslims from 
visiting the site for more than a month after a Jewish settler killed about 30 
Palestinians inside Hebron's Ibrahim Mosque, another holy site shared by both 
Muslims and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the one hand," the imam said of the restrictions, "it was to protect the 
Muslims, so they could pray without getting massacred, and also we were afraid 
that the anger of the Muslims could endanger the non-Muslims who visit here." 
</P>
<P>
 But now that the dome is nearly finished, the imam said, the Islamic board 
that oversees the shrine is reconsidering the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are hoping to lift the embargo on non-Muslims," he said, "not because the 
situation under (Israeli) occupation is getting better, but it is because the 
visitors who come here from so far away must be able to see this beautiful 
place as it is now." 
</P>
<P>
 One man who cannot come, the imam conceded, is King Hussein. Jordan has no 
diplomatic relations with Israel, and King Hussein says he will not set foot in 
Israel or the occupied territories until the two nations conclude a peace pact. 
</P>
<P>
 Imam Hussein said he has no religious objection to the inauguration ceremony 
that King Hussein plans in Amman next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "King Hussein, because he paid for this work, has a right to celebrate 
anywhere he likes," the imam said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we will celebrate only after Israel ends its occupation of our lands. We 
will not celebrate this renovation. We will celebrate liberation."

COLONEL OPENS FRONTIER FOR GIRLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The elders opposed him. Mullahs sowed doubts that he was a true Muslim. 
Parents fretted that their kids would be corrupted or depraved. 
</P>
<P>
 But Altaf Malik, a retired colonel from the Pakistani army, persisted: He 
wanted to build schools for girls. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you educate a male, you educate an individual," the 67-year-old 
artilleryman with Lincolnesque whiskers explains. "When you educate a female, 
you educate a family." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to this gentle man's determination -- along with a family trust 
commemorating his father and contributions from foreign donors -- schools for 
young girls dot some of Pakistan's harshest territory, the sparsely populated 
Chakrala Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Malik's father, a devout Muslim lawyer and social activist who ran an 
orphanage, made his home here. It was to continue his good works that the son, 
retired since 1982, hatched his plan. "I thought, female education is the need 
of the country," Malik says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the arid, sun-blasted landscape east of Mianwali, where virtually no woman 
knows how to read or write, few agreed. There women have such low status that, 
at meals, they eat last. 
</P>
<P>
 There were public schools, but few girls attended because they would have to 
walk long distances. They could be raped in the fields, it was said, or, 
virtually as bad for a family's repute, rumors could arise that they had been. 
</P>
<P>
 Since girls wouldn't or couldn't go to school, Malik hit upon the idea of 
bringing school to them: "I adopted the solution of one room, and one teacher, 
per hamlet." 
</P>
<P>
 He started in Mianwali, because he thought resistance among townspeople would 
be lower. The real challenge began when Malik arrived in the farm village of 
Chhoi, home to 40 families. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents there objected that once their daughters knew how to write, they would 
start penning love letters and having affairs. Many families said they couldn't 
afford books, paper and clothes so their daughters could go to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Village leaders were hostile. "The parents were told they were working against 
tradition, that they were spoiling their girls," Malik said. As for Muslim 
clerics, "they said: 'What is the religion of this colonel? What does he want 
to do with the girls?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such a marked lack of enthusiasm, the first rural girls school opened 
2 1/2 years ago in a rude 10-by-15-foot building of adobe, brick and wood. Many 
in Chhoi were sure that since it was not financed by the government, it would 
fail. 
</P>
<P>
 It might have, had it not been for a local woman who had received enough 
education at the Pakistani navy's school in Karachi that she could serve as 
schoolmistress. More important, the woman, Hamida Noor, was known by villagers, 
who would not have entrusted their daughters to a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was because of her that the school succeeded," Malik says. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, the rolls started to swell. The mood swing in the rocky countryside 
around Chhoi was gradual but clear. Suspicion of the new gave way to another 
emotion: jealousy. Why should Chhoi have something they didn't? people in other 
hamlets demanded. "So they came to me and asked me to open schools in their 
settlements," Altaf said. 
</P>
<P>
 His conditions were stiff: "We have no money to spend on buildings. We ask the 
community to provide the room for the school, and the teacher. The teacher must 
be one of them, since no one will come to this valley from outside. Then the 
trust provides the furniture, the learning materials and the teacher's salary." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Malik's rules, a settlement must have 30 girls before it merits a 
school. In April, 1992, one eager villager filled up his truck with girls and 
drove to Mianwali to show Malik that his hamlet had met the quota. 
</P>
<P>
 Malik couldn't find enough properly trained teachers, so he decided to train 
them. The trust enlisted village women who had received even a five-year 
primary education. In a year, Malik maintains, they can be brought up to the 
same level as teachers in state schools. They earn $17 per month, a fine salary 
in the Chakrala Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 By this April, 40 girls schools should be in operation in the valley thanks to 
Malik's persistence. "Every child costs me a rupee a day," he adds proudly. 
"This is one-tenth of what it costs the government." 
</P>
<P>
 Education Secretary M. M. Usmani and other officials, astounded by Malik's 
ability to mobilize the rural poor, have offered to help him open 60 more 
schools. UNICEF paid for a learning resource center and a van. In Mianwali, 
with help from the Canadian and Dutch embassies, Malik is building a library 
for women and children. "Our women don't go to general libraries because there 
are men there," he notes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The career soldier is brimming with ideas for what has become his second 
profession. He has begun charging families about 15 cents a month for their 
daughters' education, in a view toward making the schools self-supporting. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of Malik's experiments with what is known as "integrated rural 
development," each school has been endowed with a tree nursery. The trust has 
opened its first rural "center," a walled compound boasting a girls school, 
medical clinic and workroom for adult women to sew and embroider garments they 
can sell for a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 But it all begins with education. The schools, which cost the trust $33,000 
annually to operate, are branching out to teach reading and writing to older 
girls and a trade to married women. After a difficult start, Malik's joy is to 
have made learning a commodity in demand among the peasantry of the Chakrala 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've taken off," he says. "Our greatest accomplishment is to have taken the 
people with us."

FAIR WEATHER AND FANS; SUNNY SKIES HELP ENTICE BIG OPENING-DAY CROWD BUT FAIL 
TO BRIGHTEN OUTCOME FOR ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A spectacular spring day brought thousands of Angels fans to Monday's opening 
home game to bask in balmy, 82-degree weather in swim trunks, bikini tops and 
T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good day to play hooky and a beautiful day to take my son to an Angels 
ballgame," said Debbie Bosecker, 30, of Costa Mesa, who had dressed her 
2-year-old son in Angels blue and red. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosecker joined 37,285 fans who watched the Angels begin the 1994 home season 
with a 9-6 loss to the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Cole, 29, of Brea summed it up: "Beautiful day. (Bad) game." 
</P>
<P>
 Warm weather -- and the Angels' 2-for-1 admission -- may have resulted in the 
larger-than-anticipated crowd that led to lengthy waits at concession stands. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bad thing is that we went to get lemonade and it took two innings because 
of the long line," Bosecker said. The compensation? They "ate everything." 
</P>
<P>
 John Trosper, concession manager, said that 38 of the stadium's 47 stands were 
kept extremely busy well into the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The anticipated figure for (fans who buy tickets the day of the game) was 
4,000 to 7,000, and we exceeded that figure," Trosper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once fans bought their hot dogs, cold beers and peanuts, the only thing left 
was to settle into a stadium seat and listen to the sounds of spring: the crack 
of the bat and the roar of the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been an Angel fan since 1970," said Roger Tawara, 32, a mail clerk from 
Sherman Oaks who took a day off work to watch his favorite team. "We lived in 
L.A., but my father gave up on the Dodgers a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland Indians fan Roger Galka, 30, whose boss gave him three days off 
entirely for baseball-watching, had driven from his home in San Diego wearing a 
Cleveland batting jersey and a Cleveland baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in Aurora, Ohio, and I've been a Cleveland fan ever since," said 
Galka, a grocery produce clerk.  
</P>
<P>
 After two Cleveland players smacked home runs in the fifth inning, Galka's 
friends began yelling, "Sweep! Sweep!" 
</P>
<P>
 Noticeable this year was a gaping hole in the upper decks exposing naked 
girders where the stadium's huge Sony Jumbotron scoreboard fell during the Jan. 
17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve and Mary Brace, who had driven more than 65 miles from Arleta for the 
home opener, said they wondered about that space. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was like a stadium sunroof," Brace said.

CALIFORNIA PANEL SEEKS CENSURE OF OPTOMETRIST; EYE CARE: VIRGINIA BOARD FAILED 
TO NOTIFY STATE OFFICIALS OF RESULTS OF DISCIPLINARY HEARING AGAINST SAN JUAN 
SPECIALIST. HE PRACTICED WITHOUT A LICENSE AND WAS FOUND TO HAVE ENGAGED IN 
INAPPROPRIATE PHYSICAL CONTACT.

<P>
 To his patients, Dr. Rick Abelson is a San Juan Capistrano optometrist with an 
eye-wear shop that advertises $38 eye exams, "walk-ins welcome." 
</P>
<P>
 In a Yellow Pages ad, the 30-year-old Abelson boasts of being "one of the 
youngest doctors ever to graduate from the prestigious Pennsylvania College of 
Optometry" and has "solved some of the most difficult vision problems for the 
young and the not-so-young. . ." 
</P>
<P>
 What Abelson does not say is that he once went by the name Riad A. Aboulhosn, 
was caught practicing optometry in 1988 in Virginia without a license, and 
accused that same year of fondling a patient's breasts during an eye exam. 
Three years ago, Aboulhosn legally changed his name in California to Abelson, 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Abelson said the woman, Sharon Kay McDaniel, asked for a breast examination 
and said she believed her eye problems were related to a lump in her right 
breast. McDaniel, he said, was seeking a referral from him to see a physician 
at a local medical college. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a mistake and I paid for it and that's the sad story," he said. "I 
have not had a single complaint against me before then or since." 
</P>
<P>
 McDaniel, 30, of Richmond, who has been married 14 years and has two children, 
tells a different story. She said she visited Abelson in June, 1988, 
complaining of severe headaches, and said she had a history of diabetes, heart 
trouble and high blood pressure. Aboulhosn, she said, began fondling her 
breasts. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1989, McDaniel filed a civil lawsuit against Abelson and the 
optometrist he worked for, seeking $100,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The matter was settled out of court. Without admitting any wrongdoing, Abelson 
paid $10,000 and the insurance company that covered the optometry practice paid 
$6,000, according to Gary R. Hershner, the Richmond attorney who represented 
McDaniel. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Abelson was acquitted of sexual assault charges stemming from the 
same incident, it cost him any chance he might have had of regularizing his 
situation by taking the Virginia licensing exam, and he was told in 1990 not to 
bother reapplying for five years, according to the Virginia board's final 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 After a disciplinary hearing over McDaniel's allegations, the optometry board 
concluded that Abelson "engaged in inappropriate physical contact" with 
McDaniel, which included "touching and fondling of a sexual nature under the 
guise of a legitimate optometric examination." 
</P>
<P>
 At his Virginia disciplinary hearing, Abelson told Virginia's optometry board 
that he already had a license in California and couldn't understand why they 
would not grant him the chance to take the exam, according to Frank Pedrotty, 
assistant attorney general for the Commonwealth of Virginia. Pedrotty 
represented the optometry board against Abelson. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia's optometry board never notified California's Board of Optometry 
about their ruling, as required. If they had, California optometry officials 
say they would have pursued a case against Abelson sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 "This looks like it slipped through the cracks," Pedrotty said. 
</P>
<P>
 California medical authorities were finally tipped off to Abelson's 
whereabouts last year by Richmond television station WRIC-TV, which had aired a 
story about McDaniel. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Board of Optometry filed a complaint against Abelson in 
February in which they have sought to suspend or revoke his license, based on 
the Virginia incident. A hearing date has not been set. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pursuing this because of the seriousness and nature of what happened," 
said Rex Farmer, assistant to the optometry board's executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmer said Abelson got his California license while criminal charges were 
still pending in Virginia. At the time he took the examination for his 
California license, he had not yet been convicted of practicing optometry 
without a license, Farmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Virginia records indicate otherwise. In September, 1988, three months 
before he obtained the California license, Abelson was fined $200, given a 
60-day suspended jail sentence, and placed on probation for three years for 
practicing optometry without a license. 
</P>
<P>
 Following California's complaint, Abelson must now go before an administrative 
law judge, who will conduct a hearing and render a proposed decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's decision then goes to California's nine-member optometry board, a 
combination of professionals and public members, most of whom are appointed by 
the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The board votes on whether or not to uphold the administrative law judge's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the executive officer of the board has asked that the Abelson's 
license be suspended or revoked, the judge could rule otherwise. Punishment 
could range from a type of supervised probation -- with someone else present 
for all eye examinations involving women -- to license revocation. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmer said the board rarely decides not to discipline an optometrist after 
consulting with the state Attorney General's office and filing an accusation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done our homework beforehand, so we pretty much know what we've got," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To this day, McDaniel said she is haunted by her visit to Abelson's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "He touched me in the way only my husband had touched me," McDaniel said. "He 
wasn't the least bit interested in any kind of eye exam." 
</P>
<P>
 Abelson said he has a thriving practice in San Juan Capistrano, which he 
opened two years ago. Before that, he worked at various optometry stores 
throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In a biography that he provides to prospective patients, Abelson says he is a 
1983 graduate of Virginia Commonwealth University with a bachelor of science in 
biology and a 1987 graduate of the Pennsylvania College of Optometry. Records 
indicate he was born in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Registrar's office at Virginia Commonwealth University says Abelson never 
graduated. But records indicate he did obtain his optometry degree from 
Pennsylvania. In an interview, Abelson acknowledged not graduating from 
Virginia Commonwealth but said he spent an extra year at Pennsylvania College 
of Optometry that allowed him to obtain an undergraduate degree.

RENEWED DEMAND FOR RITE OF PASSAGE; TRADITION: CATHOLIC CHURCHES ARE 
CELEBRATING GROUP MASSES TO ACCOMMODATE LATINO PARENTS WANTING THE QUINCEANERA 
FOR THEIR 15-YEAR-OLD GIRLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Teresa Hernandez searched Orange County for weeks before finding a church that 
would honor her daughter with a private quinceanera Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 She was lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez's daughter, Janneth, was one of a few to receive the special Mass, a 
traditional Latino celebration in which a girl makes the transition into 
womanhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have a quinceanera, but I watched my seven sisters have their 
quinceaneras and I couldn't let Janneth go without one , " Teresa Hernandez, 
37, said in Spanish. "It's too special, and she deserved to be honored with a 
Mass of her own." 
</P>
<P>
 But growing demand for the special religious service has made such private 
Masses rare. Most girls seeking the Mass are being doubled and tripled up 
because of increased demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Church officials attribute the increase to the growing Latino population, 
coupled with the resurgence of interest in the religious aspect of the 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just a party," said Juanamaria Amezquita, an administrator of the 
Diocese of Orange's Hispanic Ministry. "It's the 15th anniversary of a girl's 
birth, when she is presented to society as a woman with a Mass. That's what our 
ancestors did." 
</P>
<P>
 To accommodate the increase, diocese officials said large churches throughout 
the county are beginning to celebrate monthly group Masses. 
</P>
<P>
 A quinceanera, or 15th birthday, "is very important," said Father Joe Knerr of 
St. Boniface Catholic Church in Anaheim, which last year began celebrating 
group Masses. "To them, being Catholic is what they are, and to have this 
celebration at all, of course they want the Mass." 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a floor-length, white, beaded gown with red trim and tiara, Janneth 
celebrated her private Mass on Saturday at Sagrado Corazon Mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission is one of a dwindling number of Catholic churches in the county to 
celebrate the Mass for just one girl. Others include small neighborhood 
parishes such as Our Lady of Loudres Church in Santa Ana and St. Polycarp 
Church in Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've dreamed about my quinceanera since I was 5 years old," said Janneth, a 
freshman at Western High School in Anaheim. "Because the Mass was just for me, 
it was more meaningful." 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Enrique Hernandez, 37, said: "We did everything possible to have 
this celebration." 
</P>
<P>
 And the event was a grand affair that cost about $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of 28 godparents, Janneth's party came complete with an 
abundance of flowers for the church, souvenirs for her 500 guests, mariachi and 
Banda bands, a dance hall for the reception after the Mass, and birria, 
marinated goat meat for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 During the church ceremony, Janneth vowed to help the poor and promised to try 
to be a spiritual guide to other youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, it's an action of thanks," said Father Antonio Zapata, of Sagrado 
Corazon Mission. "The young ladies thank God for their lives and renew their 
faith." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to performing group celebrations, churches increasingly are 
expanding classes that prepare the teen-agers to emphasize the religious 
significance of the tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Zapata said he is planning to offer one-day retreats for the girls so they 
will more fully understand their new responsibilities as they enter adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to place an emphasis on values and morals," the priest said in 
Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he hopes his church will be able to continue offering the 
private Masses. But because weddings and baptisms take precedence , it's 
possible Sagrado Corazon also will begin blessing the girls in groups. The move 
also would help reduce the cost of the celebration, which often reaches into 
the thousands, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve-year-old Jazmin Rodriguez of Stanton said she is looking forward to a 
group Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will be better because I won't be that nervous," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another girl, who is planning to have her Mass by herself in May, said she 
looks forward to being in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the priest to tell me I'm special on my big day because that's when 
you stop being a little girl," said Adriana Carillo, 14, of Stanton. "When you 
become a quinceanera, you take on more responsibility. It's a milestone in your 
life that shows you are maturing. A quinceanera is a tradition that will never 
die and, God willing, I will pass it on to my daughters someday."

STUDY OF OPTIONS FOR FULLERTON-IRVINE RAIL CORRIDOR OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Orange County Transportation Authority officials took the first step Monday 
toward possibly connecting Fullerton and Irvine with a mass transit system when 
they authorized a study of the proposed six-mile-wide transit corridor between 
the two cities. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to beginning the process of picking out what type of system -- 
rail or bus or nothing at all -- would best serve the corridor, the study is 
also the first step to receive federal funding for the project, which OCTA 
officials estimate could cost up to $2 billion. Currently, OCTA has $340 
million from Measure M funds set aside for the project, OCTA analyst Nancy 
Michali said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, board chairman Gaddi H. Vasquez warned at Monday's OCTA meeting that 
approval for the study did not mean the agency was also endorsing a rail line 
for the corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not competing to build a rail system. . . . We should move ahead 
cautiously before we commit to a multimillion-dollar rail transit system," 
Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michali said that Federal Transit Administration regulations require OCTA to 
look at other alternatives for the corridor, including a bus system and a 
no-build alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the study is done, we will have a well-defined bus alternative," Michali 
said. "We'll have to tell them how we propose to get in infrastructure changes 
to allow buses to run faster than they do now in congested traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent OCTA poll showed that by more than a 3-1 margin Orange County voters 
preferred an urban rail line for the corridor, which would include stops at 
Disneyland in Anaheim and South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez said the study would also help local transportation officials decide 
whether OCTA can afford to operate the proposed transit corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to know the price tag, and we need to know if we can afford to 
operate it if we buy it," Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The study is expected to begin in August and take about two years, Michali 
said. Local officials will not know if the federal government will endorse the 
project "until sometime in 1996," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the route within the corridor has not been mapped out, Michali said 
it will wind through city streets, not on the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's taken us two years just to identify the starting and ending points of 
the corridor. We will begin identifying (potential routes) in public meetings 
planned for September and October," Michali said.

SUIT OVER POWER LINES COMES TO TRIAL; LAW: THREE SAN CLEMENTE COUPLES CITE 
CANCER FEARS AND ALLEGE THAT UTILITY'S WIRES HAVE DRIVEN THEIR PROPERTY VALUES 
DOWN. 
</P>

 Mark and Cheryl McCartin's search for their dream home ended in 1989 when the 
couple paid $730,000 for a five-bedroom house on a bluff-top overlooking the 
Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in this tony Mariner's Point neighborhood where they planned to raise 
their four children, ranging in age from 2 to 6. 
</P>
<P>
 But mere months after they moved in, workers with the San Diego Gas & Electric 
Co. added four more high-voltage power lines to the seven already running 
alongside their back yard. The McCartins and a few neighbors sued, claiming 
that electromagnetic fields emitted from the power lines caused their property 
values to plummet. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, a trial of the McCartins' civil lawsuit began in Orange County 
Superior Court in Fullerton, with both sides proclaiming that a decision in 
favor of the homeowners could have significant effects on the electric utility 
industry nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark McCartin, an emergency room physician with Kaiser Permanente, said he and 
the five other homeowners are not interested in large financial settlements. 
They simply want the utility company to move the lines, because they fear that 
the electromagnetic fields generated by the power lines can cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials with San Diego Gas & Electric say the homeowners' concerns are 
unfounded. "People like the McCartins are probably sincere, but misinformed," 
said Greg Barnes, a staff lawyer for the utility company. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes and officials with the utility company say the electric current that 
runs through the lines in the San Clemente neighborhood carries the same 
voltage "that runs down every neighborhood street." They also say that dozens 
of scientific organizations across the globe -- including the Geneva-based 
World Health Organization and the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency -- have 
found no link between cancer and electromagnetic fields, known as EMFs. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, it was reported that a new study by Yale physicist Robert Adair 
concluded that the EMFs generated by electric power lines are far too weak to 
affect human cells and pose no health risk. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, to be published in the April issue of the Proceedings of the 
National Academy of Sciences, takes issue with the theory that power lines were 
responsible for slightly higher occurrences of cancer and leukemia among some 
people living near them. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes and utility company officials have suggested that the McCartins' 
lawsuit has been effectively instigated by a "well-organized consortium of 
lawyers" headed by Seattle lawyer Michael Withey "who are trying to organize a 
mass litigation campaign using the scare of EMFs." 
</P>
<P>
 But Withey, who represents the McCartins, hotly denies this, and has even 
asked Judge James R. Ross, who is presiding over the jury trial, to order the 
utility company's lawyers not to repeat such suggestions before the jury. "It's 
easy to blame attorneys. It's the mothers and fathers of America, people like 
Dr. McCartin, who are doing this to protect their children." 
</P>
<P>
 In his motion to the court, Withey said "such derogatory statements are 
improper and are not relevant to the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Withey was responsible almost four years ago for getting the Boeing Co. to pay 
$500,000 to a former employee who claimed that his leukemia was caused by 
exposure to EMFs at a company facility. Since then, Withey has filed several 
EMF lawsuits across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a San Diego case that attracted national publicity last May, Withey 
unsuccessfully argued that a 5-year-old San Diego girl had contracted a rare 
form of cancer from EMFs generated by power lines that ran over her home. That 
case was also against the San Diego Gas & Electric Co.  
</P>
<P>
 Referring to plaintiffs' attorneys involved in similar litigation across the 
country, Barnes said "these lawyers are hoping to make this (McCartin lawsuit) 
their flagship case. They are going all out to win it, so the floodgates of 
'property value cases' against utility companies will open." 
</P>
<P>
 McCartin and his neighbors dispute the utility's view of how the lawsuit came 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 McCartin said they sought out Withey after finding that the EMF levels in his 
children's rooms were more than 10 times higher than the level deemed safe by 
some people.  
</P>
<P>
 The McCartins crammed their four children in a bedroom farthest from the power 
lines and later asked other homeowners to join a neighborhood campaign to 
remove the lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of his neighbors were equally jittery, McCartin said. 
</P>
<P>
 One couple, Jean and Martin Covalt, have since abandoned their $1.5-million 
estate overlooking a canyon above north Camp Pendleton. The Covalts were unable 
to sell their home -- which includes a tennis court, swimming pool, and citrus 
and avocado orchards -- even after slashing the price by $750,000. They have 
hired Withey to handle a separate lawsuit against the San Diego Gas & Electric 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Another couple, David and Sandra Lammert, who agreed to join the McCartin 
lawsuit, said they are consumed daily by fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have young grandchildren who visit me often," said David Lammert, who paid 
$383,000 for his house in 1988. "I worry when they come over. I don't want them 
to get sick." 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners said they asked the utility company to relocate the lines in 
nearby Camp Pendleton. They were told they would have to pay for the 
relocation, which would have cost an estimated $2.5 million, McCartin said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCartin said that if the homeowners do not prevail in their legal action, 
they, too, would abandon their houses -- if they cannot find buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're scared the kids would come down with cancer," McCartin said. "We 
couldn't live with ourselves if we worried about our property values and one of 
our kids came down with cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 Withey said he was confident that the homeowners would win. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to wait and count all the grave sites before we take measures 
to protect children," Withey said. "That is the key issue in this case.

HOLOCAUST MEMORIES STILL VIVID; SCHOOLS: A SURVIVOR AND A WORLD WAR II VETERAN 
SHARE PAINFUL EXPERIENCES WITH 350 STUDENTS AT JOHN MUIR, MARKING YOM HASHOAH. 
</P>

 Holocaust survivor Sidonia Lax lifted a red apple high enough for a 
standing-room-only audience of eighth-graders to see. Lax, 66, said in a voice 
that cracked with emotion that apples always remind her of her father's death.  
</P>
<P>
 "To my father it was very important that I get a few vitamins," Lax said, 
explaining how her father would steal food for his Jewish family in Nazi 
Germany. "All my life I remember my daddy died when he went to get an apple for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Lax was speaking Monday to 350 students at John Muir Middle School to mark Yom 
Hashoah, a monthlong memorial held annually to commemorate the Holocaust. Her 
appearance -- and that of World War II veteran Chez Cheslow, who was part of an 
Allied troop that liberated German death camps at the end of the war -- was 
sponsored by the Burbank Human Relations Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Students wiped away tears as Lax described how her father, who had hid the 
family in an underground bunker, was captured by a German guard when he 
attempted to get food for her, his only child. He later died in a concentration 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Lax lost 60 relatives in the Holocaust, she told the students. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Payne waited in line with several other students after the talk to 
speak to Lax. He said he wanted to ask her for her address. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to write to her and tell her I'm sorry it happened and I don't want 
it to happen again," Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheslow, 69, explained to the students that his army unit didn't know about 
Nazi death camps until a tank he was in crashed through a chain-link fence 
surrounding Dachau in 1945. Inside the camp they found hundreds of emaciated 
Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can imagine what we thought when we saw that these peoples' knees were 
bigger than their thigh bone, and their elbow joint was bigger than their upper 
arm," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheslow, who said he still cannot bring himself to reminisce about the 
emotionally charged liberation with other veterans, urged students to seek 
racial harmony and to challenge those who say the Holocaust never occurred.  
</P>
<P>
 His message had meaning for Brienne Tucker, 14, who said she believed similar 
events could take place today. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of racist people at my school, everyone talks about everyone 
else," she said. "I don't think I have the power to stop it, but I would try to 
defend my friends no matter what their race is."  
</P>
<P>
 Presentations by other Holocaust survivors will be given in Burbank to 
eighth-graders at Luther Burbank Middle School on Wednesday and to 11th-grade 
classes at John Burroughs High School on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The program focuses on eighth- and 11th-grade students in the Burbank Unified 
School District because eighth-graders are reading Anne Frank's diary and 
11th-graders are studying World War II, said Sylvia Sutton, Yom Hashoah 
committee coordinator for the council.

 Chester David Tollakson, who had scaled six of the seven highest mountain 
peaks in the world, died over the weekend before he could fulfill his dream of 
climbing the seventh peak, Mt. Everest. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tollakson's wife, Lynn, said she will fulfill his dream by having his 
ashes scattered over Mt. Everest, the world's highest peak, when the other 
members of his mountain-climbing group make the expedition next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "He died doing what he loves," Lynn Tollakson said Monday. "I'm going to make 
sure that he reaches that peak." 
</P>
<P>
 Tollakson, 58, of Studio City, and two friends were climbing Mt. San Jacinto 
in Riverside County on Saturday in training for next year's expedition to Mt. 
Everest. The three were about 100 feet from the top of the 10,800-foot-high 
mountain, in poor weather that limited visibility to 5 to 10 feet, when 
Tollakson apparently lost his footing and fell several hundred feet down an ice 
chute to his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Reneker, 38, of Riverside, who was climbing with Tollakson, said the 
three men had started climbing the vertical north side of the mountain at 5:30 
that morning. The climbers were not roped at that time, Reneker said, because 
they felt that portion of the climb was not particularly dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was normal; the weather looked pretty good that morning," Reneker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But as they climbed higher, Reneker said visibility dropped and the winds 
began gusting. About 7 p.m. -- 15 minutes before they would reach the top -- he 
heard the third man in the group, Benjamin Chapman, 36, of Long Beach, yell 
that Tollakson had fallen. 
</P>
<P>
 Reneker said he followed a trail left by Tollakson's tumbling body on the 
snow-covered mountainside. In the middle of a bowl, several hundred feet below, 
Reneker found Tollakson's body. Reneker, a trained emergency medical 
technician, said Tollakson had suffered head injuries in the spill and was dead 
by the time he arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the poor visibility, neither man could seek help immediately. 
Reneker stayed with Tollakson's body overnight until Chapman could seek help at 
daybreak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riverside Mountain Rescue unit, along with a helicopter team from the San 
Bernardino Sheriff's Department, transported Reneker and Tollakson's body from 
the mountainside. Neither Reneker nor Chapman were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "Climbing all seven summits would have been the highlight of his life," 
Reneker said on Monday. "It was a fluke. He was the best damn teacher around. 
He was always concerned about safety first." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Pfau, who in 1986 climbed Antarctica's tallest peak -- Vinson Massif -- 
with Tollakson, said Tollakson's death was a great shock to him because of 
Tollakson's experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has taught generations of climbers with the National Ski Patrol," Pfau 
said. "He was one tough, rugged mountaineer. But climbing is like walking 
across the street in that it carries its own set of risks. Dave was as good as 
they got in minimizing them." 
</P>
<P>
 Although mountain-climbing can be dangerous, Lynn Tollakson said she never 
thought her husband -- a retired Burbank junior high school teacher -- was in 
any real danger because he was so safety-conscious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never tried to discourage him because he loved it too much," she said. "You 
can't ask someone not to do something that might be dangerous just because it 
bothers you, because you deny them living life to the fullest."

STRANGE CASE OF MARY ELLEN SAMUELS UNFOLDS; COURTS: AS THE DOUBLE-MURDER TRIAL 
ENTERS ITS THIRD WEEK, WITNESSES GIVE ACCOUNTS OF A DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY WITH 
EVEN WEIRDER FRIENDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As David Navarro tells it, he was a young man with big dreams and a puny 
wallet in November, 1988. So, when he needed someone to bankroll his fledgling 
house-hunting business, he turned to Mary Ellen Samuels, the mother of one of 
his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels said money was tight, but she did have a job for him. She asked 
Navarro to kill her estranged husband, according to Navarro's testimony last 
week in Van Nuys Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just blew it off. It was like, yeah, whatever . . . I didn't know how to 
exactly respond," Navarro told the jury. So he said he would think about it, 
"to bide time." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Nov. 11, Navarro was in a car accident and received a ticket. "I 
took it as a warning," he said, adding that he turned down the murder contract 
that night, emphatically saying "no, no, no." Samuels, Navarro said, told him 
he was being "silly." 
</P>
<P>
 So went another fairly typical day in court as Mary Ellen Samuels' 
double-murder trial chugged into a third week. A strange tale is unfolding of a 
dysfunctional family with even weirder friends, and the best drama is yet to 
come. If two people were not dead and countless lives ruined, it could even be 
funny. 
</P>
<P>
 The testimony has included talk of killing a man by dropping a 400-pound can 
opener on him at the family's Sherman Oaks sandwich shop, and of cutting 
another man into pieces to be shipped around the world. Even the investigating 
detective wasn't spared from the nastiness. As the murder investigations heated 
up, a witness said under oath that Mary Ellen Samuels taught her pet bird to 
say profane things about him. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the unflattering portrayal of Samuels and her daughter, Nicole, has 
come from prosecution witnesses who once were their closest friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "You won't like most of the prosecution witnesses," Deputy Dist. Atty. Jan 
Maurizi had warned the jury as the trial began. But, she reminded jurors, 
"There is a great difference between liking a person and believing a person." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Phil Nameth has urged jurors to keep open minds until his 
client can take the witness stand and explain matters. Nicole Samuels-Moroianu 
also hopes to testify for her mother, but because prosecutors consider her an 
un-indicted co-conspirator, her status as a witness is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels, 45, is accused of murder, soliciting murder, attempted murder and 
conspiracy in the two deaths. Her estranged husband, Robert Samuels, a 
40-year-old motion picture camera operator who worked on the films "Lethal 
Weapon" and "Heaven Can Wait," was shot to death in his Northridge home Dec. 8. 
1988. James Bernstein, 27, a small-time Sherman Oaks cocaine dealer and the hit 
man Mary Ellen Samuels allegedly hired, was strangled and dumped in remote 
Lockwood Canyon in Ventura County in June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the witnesses -- including Navarro, his former fiance, Celina Krall, 
and another friend, Heidi Dougall -- became teary-eyed on the stand when asked 
why they didn't warn Robert Samuels and Bernstein, or go to the police. They 
said they were scared and didn't know what to do. They said they thought their 
names might appear next on the hit list. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the time they were discussed, no one seemed to question the alleged 
schemes. 
</P>
<P>
 Navarro's involvement with the Samuels' family problems did not end when he 
turned down a murder contract. A month later, Navarro testified, Nicole 
Samuels-Moroianu called him and said, " 'It's done. My Dad, he's dead. I saw 
him.' I said, 'What are you calling me for? I don't want to know anything.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Six months later, in May, 1989, Navarro finally pointed the finger at Mary 
Ellen Samuels, tipping police in an anonymous call and giving detectives a poem 
-- a code so they would know him when he called again: 
</P>
<P>
 "A rose is a rose, but the nose always knows." 
</P>
<P>
 By this time, Navarro testified, he had become Bernstein's partner in a 
Sherman Oaks cocaine-dealing business. Bernstein, meanwhile, was one of 
Nicole's two fiances. 
</P>
<P>
 And so Navarro continued to socialize with Nicole Samuels-Moroianu, even 
helping Bernstein finance nearly $2,000 worth of jewelry to give her, he 
testified. When Bernstein, 27, disappeared in June, 1989, Navarro said he got 
stuck with the payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Other odd tidbits have emerged during testimony: 
</P>
<P>
 * Two months before he died, Robert Samuels purchased the book, "How to Save 
Your Marriage," hoping to reconcile with the woman he had a crush on since 
childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nicole Samuels-Moroianu asked friends to help her find a gun to kill her 
father, on at least two occasions -- in May or June, 1988, in the cafeteria of 
Alemany High School, and later in August during an outing at Zuma Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * Samuels-Moroianu, then 18, wore engagement rings on each hand, switching 
them to coincide with which of the two fiances she was with at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 * During police questioning hours after she found her husband's body, Mary 
Ellen Samuels wore a low-cut, scoop-necked top and deliberately bent over, 
displaying ample cleavage while making suggestive remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Robert Samuels' blood still stained the carpets of his Bahama Street home 
long after Mary Ellen Samuels moved back into the house. She threw a towel over 
the stain to cover it. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other characters introduced at the trial has been music promoter 
Dean Groover, who met the recently widowed Mary Ellen Samuels at a nightclub 
and soon moved in with her. The couple spent lavishly, traveling often to Las 
Vegas and Cancun. During one of those trips, Groover snapped the now infamous 
photograph of Mary Ellen Samuels lying on a bed, covered with money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in love, whatever that is," Groover testified. But the love affair 
ended, he said, when police took her away. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Groover sold home videos of Mary Ellen Samuels cavorting on a Cancun 
beach to a tabloid television show, which promptly dubbed her "the merry 
widow." The show paid him $1,100, Groover testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Groover's promotion efforts did not end there. During a court recess, Groover 
asked Judge Michael Hoff for a court order giving him exclusive rights to the 
snapshot. The request was denied. 
</P>
<P>
 Still to testify this week are Anne Hambly, the friend who housed one of 
Samuels' alleged hit men and dated another. Next, the two surviving hit men who 
admitted killing Bernstein will testify for the prosecution under deals in 
which they pleaded guilty to second-degree murder charges in exchange for their 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
 As the prosecution witnesses have recounted their tales, barrooms and clubs 
have provided a common backdrop. Celina Krall told how she and her friends used 
to dress up together at Mary Ellen Samuels' Reseda condominium before hitting 
the bars. She was 16 at the time, but had no problem getting served because 
"everybody knew Mary Ellen." 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole case needs a 12-step program. Several, in fact," defense attorney 
Nameth observed recently outside the courtroom.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; ANTI-SEMITIC FLYERS FOUND AT 2 SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 150 anti-Semitic flyers were found stuffed inside student lockers at 
two Mission Viejo schools Monday, less than three months after similar 
incidents in San Juan Capistrano and Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at Los Alisos Intermediate School and Mission Viejo High School found 
the flyers Monday morning after returning from a weeklong spring break, said 
Elaine Carter, a spokeswoman for the Saddleback Valley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alisos, which has students from Mission Viejo, Lake Forest and Laguna 
Hills, was the hardest hit with 150 of the flyers found on campus, Carter said. 
A much smaller number of the same flyers were found at the high school, Carter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators from both schools responded immediately by discussing the 
incidents with students on a public intercom, and a letter will be sent home to 
all parents indicating that the school is "not responsible for this deplorable 
type of literature," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to reassure parents that we are on top of this," Carter said. "The 
community needs to know we will act in a timely fashion. We will not tolerate 
this type of thing on our campuses." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies, representatives of the Orange County Human Relations 
Commission and the Anti-Defamation League, and three rabbis from local temples 
were notified of the incidents, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Bernstein, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, said the 
group's legal affairs division is looking into this "vile stuff." He added that 
the group is looking into some "counter programming" and will send a letter to 
all county principals alerting them to the flyer incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, racist flyers aimed at Latinos were distributed in lockers at 
Marco Forster Middle School and Laguna Beach High School.LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; VIGIL, FAST PROTEST SCHOOL OF AMERICAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 20 members of Veterans for Peace Inc. and other Orange County groups 
began a two-day vigil and fast on the steps of the Santa Ana Federal Building 
on Monday in opposition to the U.S. Army's School of the Americas, which 
activists describe as a "school for assassins." 
</P>
<P>
 The local protest coincides with the start of a 40-day fast by an American 
priest on the steps of the U.S. Capitol in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is, people hunger for peace and justice," said Jim Gibson, 
president of the Orange County chapter of Veterans for Peace. 
</P>
<P>
 He described the school, used for the training of military personnel from more 
than 20 Central and South American countries, as a "Cold War device we feel 
doesn't have any purpose anymore." Among the graduates of the school are former 
Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the school, which has come under increasing pressure from 
political and religious leaders in recent years, have said the training now 
places more emphasis on human rights and helps professionalize Latin American 
military forces. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to handing out flyers to those passing in and out of the Federal 
Building, the activists staged an "Awards of Infamy" play in which they 
presented mock awards to costumed actors playing the roles of what they 
described as the school's "most murderous alumni." 
</P>
<P>
 The school was established in Panama in 1946 and moved to Ft. Benning, Ga., in 
1984 to comply with terms of the Panama Canal Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Roy Bourgeois, the Roman Catholic Maryknoll priest who is staging the 
Washington fast, started his campaign to close the school in 1990 and has twice 
been sent to prison for his protests. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the school's estimated 54,000 graduates, the largest number are from 
Colombia, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Panama, according to activists. ANNA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; WEED-ABATEMENT EFFORT UNDERWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Property owners who have received weed-removal notices have until May 19 to 
clear their land, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing will be held on that date for property owners who want to appeal the 
notice. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, city work crews will begin clearing the properties of those not 
complying and not exempted. The city will charge for the work on property tax 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say the work must be done before the start of the fire season. 
</P>
<P>
 The weed-abatement program targets overgrown vegetation such as sagebrush, 
shrubs, poison oak or dry grass. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to being a fire hazard, weeds also pose health problems for 
allergy sufferers and are a visual blight, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The abatement program extends to trash as well as weeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owners were notified in January of the impending weed-abatement 
drive. Official notices were sent earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The May 19 public hearing will be at 5 p.m. May 19 at City Hall, 32400 Paseo 
Adelanto.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: STANTON; COUNCIL MAY LEGALIZE 'SAFE, SANE' FIREWORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council tonight will consider legalizing "safe and sane" fireworks, 
and three council members have said they are ready to vote for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 All fireworks have been banned in Stanton since residents voted in 1988 not to 
allow even so-called "safe and sane" fireworks.The state fire marshal regulates 
the amounts of gunpowder and range of flames from such fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Fire Department officials, who provide fire protection services 
to the city, have condemned "safe and sane" fireworks, saying they can still 
cause injury to people and property. 
</P>
<P>
 But now a majority of the council appears ready to allow the fireworks so that 
nonprofit organizations can sell them to raise money. Councilmen Harry Dotson 
and Sal Sapien voted their approval in 1993 and said last month that they plan 
to do so again. 
</P>
<P>
 And Councilman William C. Estrada, who last year said "safe and sane" 
fireworks might injure children, now says he believes most accidents are caused 
by illegal fireworks. WILLSON CUMMER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; 19 WILL SHARE LOTTERY PRIZE OF $20.3 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For six years, Dann F. Petel went around bugging his co-workers at the 
Downtown office of the state Department of Insurance to join him in a pool to 
play the state Lottery's twice-a-week Super Lotto. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's your $5?" Petel said he would ask people. He said some balked, 
insisting they would never win. 
</P>
<P>
 Those naysayers are probably kicking themselves now that Petel and 18 of his 
co-workers won Saturday's jackpot of $20.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a lot of long faces this morning at the office," said Petel, who spoke 
for the group Monday at a news conference at the Lottery's district office in 
Van Nuys. "Several people came up to me and said 'Why didn't you ask me to 
play?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew Andreeff of Sun Valley has been part of the pool for nearly three 
years. Andreeff said that at times he had thought of dropping out of the group 
because it had failed to win any big jackpots. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I always played," said Andreeff, who will use part of his winnings to pay 
off debt. "Some people quit at the wrong time. Luckily, I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 19 winners -- six of whom live in the San Fernando Valley -- 15 will 
receive full shares of $1.07 million, or about $53,000 annually for the next 20 
years before federal taxes. Four people will split two full shares. The first 
checks will arrive in four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Petel said, none of the winners is expected to quit his or her job. 
</P>
<P>
 Petel said he has been trying to get his co-workers to pool their money to buy 
lottery tickets since 1988. He said the pool has been as small as two people 
for some games, and as large as 25 people for others. 
</P>
<P>
 The minimum entry is $5, although entries were allowed to be split by two 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Petel, 67, of Pasadena, said the group had never matched more than four 
numbers, and never won more than $112. Those winnings were always replayed at 
the next game. 
</P>
<P>
 While some specific numbers were played, there were always Quick Picks among 
the group's numbers. Saturday's winning numbers of 2, 4, 8, 14, 24 and 41, were 
picked by the computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past six years, Petel has bought his tickets at Gus's Chevron Station 
in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Gus Khazaal, the owner of the gas station, said that Petel called him Saturday 
to find out the winning numbers because a Dodgers baseball game preempted the 
Lottery's Big Spin television show. 
</P>
<P>
 "He called me back 10 minutes later and said he had the six winning numbers," 
said Khazaal, who will receive about $100,000 for selling the winning ticket. 
"I thought he was joking. But he wasn't. I feel great." JULIO MORAN

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; CITY CONSIDERS CABLE CONTRACT EXTENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Burbank City Council today is scheduled to consider a three-month 
extension on its franchise agreement with cable TV company Sammons 
Communications, whose service agreement with the city expires April 28. 
</P>
<P>
 In the action last week, the City Council approved the basic cable service 
rate at $10.16 as well as the installation charge of $30.But the city rejected 
Sammons' posted hourly rate for service calls of $71.25 and cut that rate to 
$22.35 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Sammons Communications, based in Dallas, has 30 days to appeal the council 
action to the Federal Communications Commission, but has not yet responded, 
Assistant City Manager Steve Helvey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiations may still not be completed with the three-month extension, 
Helvey said. "It would not surprise me if we had to come back and request 
another extension," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it is not likely that Sammons would lose its franchise with Burbank 
because of restrictions set by federal law and the impracticalities of changing 
a cable operator, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other business Tuesday, the council will also consider a plan to reseal 
several Burbank streets. If the plan passes as expected, roadways west of Buena 
Vista Street and north of Burbank Boulevard will be resealed beginning in July, 
said Chuck Gustafson, the Public Works Department supervising city engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire project is expected to take 80 days. ED BOND

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; ROAD RALLY PLUGS LOW-POLLUTING AUTOS

 Sleek sports cars and boxy buses powered by electricity and natural gas glided 
down Disneyland's Main Street U.S.A. on Monday in the finale of a three-day 
road rally designed to increase awareness of cleaner-burning car engines. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Leslie Nielsen of "Naked Gun" fame led the parade through Disneyland in 
a bright red electric-powered sports car, and Bill Nye, host of a children's 
science television show, plugged wiser energy use. 
</P>
<P>
 "The future of the United States and of the world can't have the same energy 
use per person as it does now," Nye said. He pointed to an ultrasleek auto 
covered with hand-sized solar panels on display in the Disney parking lot and 
more than two dozen experimental cars parked nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you see here is not the answer, but it's the kind of pattern that is 
going to lead to the answer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 vehicles participated in the 120-mile rally, which began 
Saturday at the Los Angeles Convention Center, where U.S. Energy Secretary 
Hazel O'Leary waved the green starting flag. 
</P>
<P>
 The cars took three days to wend their way through Santa Monica, Long Beach 
and Newport Beach to the final stop at Disneyland in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the third World Clean Air Road Rally organized by a nonprofit Seal 
Beach group called International Electric Grand Prix Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is dedicated to promoting cleaner air through research, development 
and marketing of electric and alternative energy vehicles, executive director 
Peter Hackes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you ever tried to breathe in Southern California, you know we need 
alternative energy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires that by 1998, 2% of all cars sold in California be "zero 
emission" or electric vehicles, Hackes said. Cars that use compressed natural 
gas and propane have extremely low emissions levels and can travel longer 
distances than the electric cars and will help reduce pollution, Hackes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cars are hybrids, like a model designed by students at Western Washington 
University that uses solar-generated electricity for city travel and natural 
gas for longer hauls on the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 While many of the cars on display seemed futuristic, electric cars are used 
today by cities and companies for jobs requiring local travel, said a spokesman 
for U.S. Electricar. 
</P>
<P>
 The company manufactures a car that looks like any other, except for an 
electric cord that is plugged into a socket overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 The disadvantages of electric cars right now are that they cannot go long 
distances without recharging, which takes eight hours, and they are too 
expensive for most individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Onlookers seemed intrigued by the display of newfangled autos. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is neat," said David Hughes, 38, of La Mirada, who stopped to admire 
the red sports car. "If we could get away from using gasoline it would be 
great."MARY LOU PICKEL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; YOUNGSTERS REACT TO ANTI-SMOKING ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AILEEN CHO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anti-smoking ads showing cigarettes as "uncool" and a "turn-off" reinforce the 
lessons taught in school that smoking is unhealthy, according to a study by 
professors from UC Irvine and the University of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-year study of 304 seventh-graders in Orange County and Los Angeles 
concluded that exposure to anti-smoking ads helped the students think of 
smoking as immature and unglamorous. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found that with the seventh-graders, they universally held negative 
beliefs about smoking and health," said Connie Pechmann, assistant professor at 
UCI's Graduate School of Management. "They knew it was unhealthy, unwise, 
unsafe. . . . Health education has been very effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "But what the ads did," she said, is "help create the impression that smoking 
is immature, uncool and not sexy." 
</P>
<P>
 Pechmann's partner in the study was Srinivasan Ratneshwar, assistant professor 
of business administration at the University of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main issue is, are the anti-smoking ads needed, given health education 
classes?" Pechmann said. "The idea was that kids who smoke have a positive 
perception of smokers, and kids prone to resist smoking have negative 
perceptions. We did the study to find out how advertisements affect those 
perceptions." 
</P>
<P>
 In the test, students were first shown a magazine with either cigarette ads, 
anti-smoking ads or neither. Then they were asked to evaluate a teen-ager based 
on a written description. Half were told the teen-ager smoked. 
</P>
<P>
 Results showed that the youths who had seen the anti-smoking ads, which 
included a girl turning away from her boyfriend's bad breath, judged the 
"smoker" lower on common sense, appeal, maturity and glamour than those who had 
seen no ads at all, Pechmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who had seen cigarette ads tended to have more positive attitudes toward 
the "smoker," but did judge the smoker lower on maturity, just as the 
anti-smoking ad group did. 
</P>
<P>
 The professors have received additional funding from the UC Tobacco-Related 
Disease Research Program to do more research on youngsters who are more 
vulnerable to peer pressure to smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Youngsters in the current study were already resistant to smoking, Pechmann 
said: "When you take kids that are pro-smoking, will anti-smoking ads work for 
them?" 
</P>
<P>
 She said the new study would make a stronger attempt to specifically choose 
youths who are vulnerable to smoking. AILEEN CHO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO SEX ASSAULT CHARGES 
</P>

<P>
 A man who is charged with raping four girls last fall while he was on parole 
for another rape pleaded not guilty Monday to 20 felony counts of sexual 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Lee Donaldson, 34, was ordered to stand trial in Superior Court two 
weeks ago on charges of attacking two girls in Pacoima on Sept. 21 and 22 and 
two more in Inglewood on Oct. 11 and 18. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, prosecutors expect to charge Donaldson with two counts of rape 
and single counts of sodomy and kidnaping in an Oct. 12 abduction of a 
13-year-old girl who was walking to Inglewood's Morningside High School, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jacquelyn Lacey. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the other four girls, the 13-year-old victim was walking to school about 
7:30 a.m. when she was grabbed from behind and taken to an abandoned apartment 
building, Lacey said. Even though the victim identified another man as her 
attacker, blood tests exonerated him. Altogether, Donaldson will face about 200 
years in prison if he is convicted, Lacey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacoima attacks occurred near the intersection of Van Nuys Boulevard and 
Borden Avenue. Donaldson was convicted of raping a 15-year-old boy in the same 
area in 1982. He was paroled about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Donaldson is being held in lieu of $2-million bail. THOM MROZEK

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUNLAND-TUJUNGA; OFFICER WORKING OUT OF SERVICE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Often, the first reaction Los Angeles Police Officer Ernst Cabriales gets when 
he visits a business for the first time is, "What's wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
 Cabriales started working out of a new LAPD community service center at the 
Sunland-Tujunga Chamber of Commerce last month.  
</P>
<P>
 He said that it's so unusual to have a regular police presence in the area 
that merchants and residents often don't realize that he's not there on a case. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabriales said he hopes his continued presence in the neighborhood will turn 
that response around. The arrival of a police officer, he said, does not always 
mean bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabriales' arrival was greeted favorably by local merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the feeling the Police Department wasn't doing anything for anyone," 
said one local business owner who complained about how a few years ago it took 
four hours for police to respond when his business was broken into. Now he 
takes comfort in the police car parked nearby for two hours a day while 
Cabriales is in his new office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed him up here," said Lorraine Desmond, a vice president at the 
Chamber of Commerce and a local realtor. She said the number of transients in 
the area has dropped dramatically since the new service center was started. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal grant money is now paying the salary for Cabriales, who had been a 
patrol officer in Sunland-Tujunga for two years before starting this latest 
assignment a week and a half ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He uses the chamber office for two hours Tuesday through Saturday in the 
afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabriales said residents have come into the office to let him know about 
everything from drug activity to barking dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the local service center, the LAPD Foothill Division has been 
increasing patrol cars in the community since December. New foot patrols began 
in February and the chamber is also organizing a Business Watch program. 
</P>
<P>
 The new community service center is being paid for out of a $4-million federal 
grant to Los Angeles as part of an effort to put more police officers on the 
street, said Sgt. Brad Young, grant coordinator for the LAPD Foothill Division.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: RESTRUCTURING HELPS NONPROFIT FOUNDATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly a year ago, Ray Castellani was ready to call it quits. 
</P>
<P>
 The former actor's nonprofit mobile soup kitchen, called the Frontline 
Foundation, had nearly run out of money and Castellani was forced to cut paid 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 But help from celebrities such as Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, producer of the 
television show "Designing Women," contributions from schools and businesses 
and a $1,400 anonymous gift kept the organization alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Frontline was born six years ago when Castellani, who had lived on the 
streets, handed out 11 peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches on impulse. 
</P>
<P>
 At its peak, the Van Nuys organization delivered 6,000 meals each month. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, about $3,000 in the red, Castellani restructured his nonprofit 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 He switched to an all-volunteer staff and sought donations for food and 
utensils. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided we would not pay for one single, solitary thing," Castellani said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the organization serves 5,000 people each month. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last December, Castellani has been holding a monthly fund-raiser dinner 
at a small Chinese restaurant in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Castellani, a cowboy actor in the '50s and '60s, said his guests include 
actors and actresses, people already involved with Frontline and area business 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're back at full swing and on the brink of really being able to make a 
dent on Skid Row," said Castellani. TERESA ANN WILLIS

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; RED CROSS MAY JOIN L.A. CHAPTER BY JULY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Burbank chapter of the American Red Cross could merge with the Los Angeles 
chapter as soon as July, Red Cross officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the board of directors of the Burbank chapter voted to join the Los 
Angeles group, saying that financial troubles made it difficult for the chapter 
to continue operating on its own.The merger would leave Burbank without its own 
Red Cross organization, but services in the city would continue at present 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything will be the same," said Gay Weston, Burbank chapter executive 
director. "But someone else will be paying the bills." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles chapter's board of directors will vote on the merger April 20, 
said Ann Sobel, associate manager for the Los Angeles chapter. "We're not 
anticipating opposition," Sobel said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Los Angeles chapter accepts the merger, it would then be finalized by 
the Red Cross' National Board of Governors when they meet in May, and the 
merger could go into effect with the new fiscal year in July, "pending those 
approvals," Sobel said. 
</P>
<P>
 A small group of the Burbank board had made a last-ditch effort to save the 
chapter, but had failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Burbank likes to retain its autonomy," Weston said. "I can understand that, 
but you have to look at the costs." 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank chapter is projecting a $7,500 deficit for the 1993-94 fiscal 
year, the third year in a row that the agency has fallen short financially. 
</P>
<P>
 The current recession has cut the amount the Burbank chapter receives in 
donations from both the general public and the United Way, Weston said. ED BOND

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: MTA TO HOLD MEETING ON POSSIBLE FARE HIKE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will hold a community 
meeting in Burbank next week to inform residents of a possible hike in bus 
fares and reduction in service beginning this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The informal meeting, scheduled for Monday, is part of an ongoing effort to 
gauge public opinion concerning the fare and service changes that MTA officials 
believe will be necessary to close a $126-million operating shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Possible actions include increasing the basic fare by more than a third -- 
from $1.10 to $1.50 -- and eliminating underused bus lines. Any changes would 
probably go into effect July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting is scheduled for 5:30 p.m. in the auditorium of Burbank Central 
Library, 110 N. Glenoaks Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 A formal public hearing on fare and service adjustments will be held April 23 
at the county Hall of Administration in downtown Los Angeles. HENRY CHU

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; OCC CLUB FOCUSES ON MANY USES OF HEMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange Coast College club that wants to legalize marijuana has become 
popular with students, attracting more than 150 members, according to its 
founder. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Wilson, a 21-year-old business major, founded the college-sanctioned Hemp 
Club in January. He and other club members now sell T-shirts and hats made from 
hemp fibers and have meetings to educate people about the beneficial uses of 
hemp. 
</P>
<P>
 The hemp plant is best known as the source of the drug marijuana, but club 
members argue it can be processed into methanol fuel and oil as well as used in 
the manufacture of paint, varnish and other oil-based products. Hemp plant 
fibers would produce enough paper to eliminate the use of timber, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Club members are circulating petitions in favor of a ballot initiative to let 
people grow marijuana and use the drug, Wilson said. The group is focused 
around building support for the hemp initiative, not personal use of the drug, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the time I've had this hemp club, there has never been a discussion about 
smoking marijuana," Wilson said. "Our goal is not to get high. This is about 
saving Earth while we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson denounced the "sensationalism" that he said surrounds the movement to 
legalize hemp. But he agreed that he would enjoy the freedom to use marijuana. 
"If the hemp initiative were passed, yeah, I believe I'd smoke some marijuana," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said OCC's Earth Day celebration on April 19 will feature speakers who 
will proclaim the virtues of the banned plant. Jack Herer, who wrote "The 
Emperor Wears No Clothes," a book that argues the benefits of hemp, will be 
there, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a woman with glaucoma, who is one of the few people in the 
country legally allowed to use marijuana, will talk about the drug's use in 
treatment of her eye disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hemp Club meets on Tuesdays at noon at the Technology Building, Room 118, 
on the OCC campus.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; SANTA ANA MAN DIES IN FREEWAY CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Ana man was killed Monday morning when his van skidded out of control 
on the Santa Ana Freeway, sliding across three lanes of traffic and crashing 
into a tree, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvador Barajas, 51, died in the 6:30 a.m. crash just north of Lincoln Avenue 
on the northbound freeway, CHP spokeswoman Joan Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said it was not known why Barajas lost control of his van. 
</P>
<P>
 No one else was injured, Rivas said. Barajas had no passengers, and his van 
did not hit any other cars as it slid from the far left lane onto the shoulder, 
where it slammed into a tree on the embankment, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
 One lane of the freeway was closed for about two hours while the CHP 
investigated the accident, Rivas said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; JANITOR ARRESTED IN COURTHOUSE THEFTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 17-year county employee was arrested on suspicion of stealing more than 
$20,000 worth of property from the Orange County Courthouse and other county 
facilities, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen McGrauth, 37, a janitor, was arrested April 6 when he returned to 
retrieve stolen power tools in a courthouse stairwell, according to Lt. Dan 
Martini of the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marshal's Department, which is responsible for courthouse security, 
received information that the power tools, reported stolen April 5, had been 
seen in the stairwell. After several hours of surveillance, McGrauth was seen 
collecting the tools and arrested, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 A search warrant issued for McGrauth's Corona home turned up computer 
equipment worth more than $20,000, which authorities suspect was stolen from 
county buildings. The equipment, mostly in the form of disassembled computer 
parts, included monitors, keyboards, printers, software and microprocessors. 
Most of the property was listed as missing in two previous thefts reported at 
the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrauth was arrested without incident and booked at the Orange County Jail, 
but later released on his own recognizance, Martini said. He is scheduled to be 
arraigned May 4. 
</P>
<P>
 The county General Services Administration has placed McGrauth on paid 
administrative leave during the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Martini called the thefts "bizarre," saying investigators are still trying to 
identify some of the computer components.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: UNIFORMS GAIN POPULARITY AT PUBLIC SCHOOL 
</P>

<P>
 It looks like recess at a private school: Children running around the 
playground with matching navy blue cardigans buttoned up or tied around their 
waists. Red ties hanging neatly on white shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Melveny Elementary is a public school, one of a growing number in the 
San Fernando Valley to adopt an optional uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 A council of parents and teachers voted for the uniform policy in the fall and 
students began wearing the red, white and blue uniforms in January.  
</P>
<P>
 About six in 10 O'Melveny students wear a uniform to school and more are 
joining the ranks every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel great with this uniform," said 9-year-old Adrian Sandoval, sporting 
navy blue shorts with a white shirt. "It makes me feel more happy and clean." 
</P>
<P>
 For about $85, parents can outfit a student with three pairs of pants, three 
shirts, a sweater and a tie.  
</P>
<P>
 Parents cite many practical reasons for uniforms, including saving money and 
keeping children out of gang-affiliated clothing.  
</P>
<P>
 But many say the heightened self-esteem in their children is the most 
compelling reason in support of the uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter feels more important and more proud of herself," said Maria 
Aguilar of her 6-year-old.  
</P>
<P>
 "She takes off her uniform after school and hangs it up. She doesn't let 
anybody touch it." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the state Education Code, public schools cannot require that students 
wear uniforms, but several schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District 
have adopted policies encouraging students to wear them. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 80% of the students at San Fernando Elementary School wear some form of 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Vaughn Next Century Learning Center -- the first school in the Valley 
to adopt a uniform policy about three years ago -- about 70% of the students 
wear them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was tired of seeing my daughter cry after school because she didn't have 
Guess jeans or Levi's. I couldn't afford it," said Elsa Rojas, who has two 
daughters at Vaughn. "With a uniform, the hassles are gone." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Melveny has already answered several calls from other elementary schools 
looking for advice on how to get a uniform policy initiated.  
</P>
<P>
 Dress codes and uniforms sometimes generate objections from parents who 
believe they inhibit freedom of expression. But at O'Melveny, after more than a 
year of parent education and involvement, the uniforms have unified rather than 
divided parents and students. 
</P>
<P>
 "It puts everybody on one level," said Jabir Amaya, a parent who headed the 
uniform committee. "There is no difference in people who have money and those 
who don't." SUSAN BYRNES

<P>
 Spurred by student tales of fighting, bullying and general mischief on the 
Lindero Canyon Middle School campus, a group of about two dozen parents is 
trying to organize a parent patrol to watch over hallways, bathrooms and lunch 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lack of enforcement of any discipline," said Nancy Arkin, one of 
the group's organizers whose 12-year-old daughter attends the 1,100-student 
school. "We are talking about the safety of our children." 
</P>
<P>
 Arkin said parents have met twice in the past week to address allegations that 
administrators do not effectively oversee the campus and do not take decisive 
action against students who misbehave. Parents say they have heard that 
students set fires in lockers, bully others in the locker room and pull down 
the pants of other youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 If administrators approve, the parents say they hope to oversee a variety of 
sites on campus in an effort to discourage such pranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindero Principal Ronald Kaiser acknowledged some of the pranks, but defended 
the school's discipline procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lindero is a safe place for students," he said. "These are issues that have 
been universal to middle schools ever since their existence. . . These are 
pranks. This is what middle school kids do." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the same students usually instigate the foul play. So far this year, 
he said, students have been suspended 113 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser said that the 13-acre campus is overcrowded, which makes supervision 
difficult. In the wake of a fatal stabbing at Valley View Junior High School in 
Simi Valley, the school is considering hiring one or two more supervisory 
aides. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Kaiser said, he welcomes parent involvement, provided the parent 
volunteers are trained and fingerprinted. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Bara, whose 11-year-old son attends Lindero and was hit in the face with a 
book in an altercation with another student, said having parents on campus 
would do more than relieve parent concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students feel unsafe," said Bara. "The presence (of the parents) will make 
them feel better." SUSAN BYRNES

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; CITY TO DISCUSS AUDIT OF FIRE DEPARTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council tonight will discuss an independent financial audit of the 
embattled Fire Department, which reportedly has allowed some firefighters to 
regularly collect $20,000 to $40,000 a year in overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit, expected to be released today and discussed at the 7:30 p.m. 
council meeting, was prepared by the accounting firm of KMPG Peat Marwick, the 
same firm that completed an initial audit several months ago that revealed 
large amounts of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit is expected to play a major role in an already strained relationship 
between city leaders and the firefighters association, which supports a recall 
of the four council members who voted to overhaul the fire service. 
</P>
<P>
 The association has filed a federal civil rights lawsuit charging that 
officials punished top labor leaders for campaigning for the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Between July 1 and Sept. 15, firefighters charged up to $283,000 in overtime, 
exhausting the $75,000 reserved for such wages in the 1993-94 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Although firefighters have denied any wrongdoing, Paul Gilbrook, president of 
the firefighters association, was placed on administrative leave. He was 
subsequently fired for driving a firetruck with a suspended license and using 
sick leave improperly. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for the association have blamed the overtime situation on the City 
Council for failing to hire more firefighters.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; WOMAN RUNNING ON FREEWAY IS KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 35-year-old Anaheim woman was killed Monday while she was running in and out 
of traffic on the Garden Grove Freeway, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just after 4 p.m., Gail Roysdon of Buena Park was reported running in the 
westbound lanes of the freeway at Hoover Street, CHP Officer Joan Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHP ran a traffic break on the westbound lanes to allow her to get to the 
shoulder from the center divider, where she was standing. 
</P>
<P>
 Roysdon, shouting incoherently, ran toward a parked CHP patrol car, Rivas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She then ran back to the center divider, climbed over and dashed into the 
eastbound lanes, near the intersection with Beach Boulevard, and was struck by 
a pickup truck, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics treated her, but she died at the scene.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; LENONIS ADOBE REPAIRS TO COST ABOUT $250,000 
</P>

<P>
 Earthquake repairs to the Leonis Adobe will cost about $250,000 and keep the 
historic home closed for at least six months, the museum's president said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I've learned from running this place for 30 years is patience," 
said Ray Phillips, president of the Leonis Adobe Assn."In the meantime, we are 
not closed. The Plummer House is still open, the barn is open, all the animals 
are there and you can see the house from the outside." 
</P>
<P>
 The adobe, also known as Los Angeles' Cultural Historical Monument No. 1, 
suffered severe cracks in the walls on the southeast corner of the house, 
including the restored living room and, upstairs, the bedroom where settler 
Miguel Leonis and his wife, Espiritu Chijulla, slept more than 100 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The longhorn cattle and other animals and the restored Plummer House, moved in 
1983 from Plummer Park in Hollywood, still attract tour groups from schools and 
elsewhere, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cracks will be filled with the same mixture of mud and water used in the 
construction of the house in 1845, but will be injected with a motorized pump, 
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the work, 90% of which is covered by earthquake insurance, involves 
placing wood supports along the top of each wall in the attic to strengthen the 
whole building. Before work can begin, architectural plans must be drawn and 
approved by the city of Los Angeles. "We're hoping it will look exactly the 
same," Phillips said. "If you look closely, though, you'll be able to see where 
the earthquake damage was. It's part of the history of the house." KURT PITZER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; CITY TO RENAME PARK TO HONOR LIONS CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members have decided to rename El Centro Park after the La Habra 
Host Lions Club in recognition of its work there. 
</P>
<P>
 The new name, El Centro Lions Park, honors the club for building basketball 
courts, fences, walkways and patio canopies in the park.They continue to do 
landscaping and fix lights, and are planning to add about 30 benches. The park 
has also been home to the club's annual Corn Festival since 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the Lions had requested that the park be renamed in memory of club 
member Ramon T. Hornbuckle, who died last year. Hornbuckle was known in the 
community for his work in providing eyeglasses for needy children. 
</P>
<P>
 The council rejected that request because no other park in the city is named 
after an individual, and the city had no guidelines to follow for such 
requests.  
</P>
<P>
 Subsequently, a policy was adopted giving the city authority to consider 
renaming a park after a deceased person only after the person has been dead for 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Lions Club could have requested again that the city consider renaming 
the park after Hornbuckle. The club, however, chose to request that the city 
name the park after the club, because many members, including Hornbuckle, have 
contributed to beautifying and adding buildings to the park over the past 50 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 While city officials commended the club's efforts, a resident, Don Wright, 
said he fears that other organizations will now want parks named in their honor 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman William D. Mahoney said, "It's going to take a lot of work on 
the part of other service clubs to be considered." 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, the council voted to name a new park in La Habra Hills Vista 
del Valle Park.MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; HOPES RAISED FOR BRIDGE AT TRACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There may be light at the end of the tunnel for motorists who have put up with 
long, slow freight trains blocking Imperial Highway, the primary route to the 
Riverside Freeway for residents living on Yorba Linda's east side. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have been frustrated in efforts to obtain a remedy from the 
Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe railroad, but now, with passenger trains planned 
for the tracks, relief may be in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are hoping that use of the tracks by Metrorail trains will qualify 
the crossing for a bridge or an underpass, which would elevate either the 
tracks or the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Although only a few passenger trains pulling a few cars are expected to run on 
the tracks, which parallel Esperanza Road, that may make the crossing eligible 
for grade-improvement funds from the Orange County Transit Authority, the 
county and the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will certainly put Yorba Linda in a better spot to win funding for an 
undercrossing," OCTA Director Stan Oftelie said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Oftelie said, OCTA was more concerned with tracks used by Amtrak, 
such as the line that runs from Oceanside to Fullerton. Compounding the problem 
is that even though Yorba Linda residents are most affected by the long delays, 
the railroad crossing actually lies in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, with commuter service planned for the spur bordering Yorba Linda, 
there is new interest in dealing with traffic problems created by trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding is dependent on a complex formula that considers the number of cars 
and the number of trains using the crossing, he said. With the additional use 
of the line by commuter trains, the crossing should become eligible, he said.

<P>
 Residents who live in the nearby Westpark village have long suggested that 
vacant land on Harvard Avenue be converted into a recreation area. 
</P>
<P>
 A plan calling for the development of athletics fields, green spaces and 
walkways will be unveiled at tonight's meeting. The plan was drawn up after 
architects held a community meeting to hear residents' ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, the park would be connected by walk paths to the Civic Center 
and nearby child-care center.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SPLASHY CELEBRATION TO MARK BUDDHIST HOLIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thais will celebrate their new year with a splash during this weekend's 
Songkran festival, as devotees toss water on each other in celebration of the 
2,537th year since the enlightenment of Buddha. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a holiday for fun," said Phra Sumanatissa Barua, a monk at the Wat Thai 
Buddhist temple in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Thailand, this is the time of very hot weather. So this is how we say, 
'Happy New Year.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The holiday is traditionally a combination of a springtime celebration and a 
religious event. 
</P>
<P>
 It marks the beginning of the Thai calendar, which is counted from the year 
that an Indian prince named Siddhartha achieved enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
 April's cruel heat prompted Siamese villagers even before the time of Buddha 
to celebrate the last days before the rainy season with water splashing, food 
and gifts to the spirits of the land. 
</P>
<P>
 During Songkran, the rigid social hierarchy in Thailand melts somewhat, and 
just about anyone becomes a fair target for a cupful of water. 
</P>
<P>
 Respect is still paid to monks in saffron robes and older people,who accept 
scented water poured over their hands as an homage to their wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's mostly the younger people who do the splashing," said Nancy 
Poopongpaibul, a teacher at Wat Thai.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's done to wish good luck and happiness to the people who receive the 
water." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the statues of Buddha get a bath with scented water, along with donations 
of fruit, incense and flowers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everything gets clean," Phra Sumana said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year's Songkran event draws many of the more than 100,000 Southern 
Californians who come from the Southeast Asian country and form the world's 
largest community of expatriate Thais. 
</P>
<P>
 The festivities will take place at Wat Thai, 8225 Coldwater Canyon Ave., from 
9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and is free to the public.  
</P>
<P>
 Non-Thais are encouraged to come sample the food and Thai culture, including 
beauty pageants, Thai classical dance and music, parades and games. KURT PITZER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; VISITORS CENTER PLAN FOR LITTLE SAIGON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By BERT ELJERA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to open a visitors and cultural center in Little Saigon will go 
before the Redevelopment Agency today. 
</P>
<P>
 The city agency would provide about $152,000 to operate the center for at 
least one year, according to members of an advisory group of merchant and 
business leaders who are drafting a plan to promote Little Saigon, a 
two-square-mile area, as a tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the money would be used to print promotional materials that will be 
distributed in Los Angeles and Orange counties, said Randy Russell, co-chairman 
of the Bolsa Corridor Advisory Committee, which is planning the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell said that money to install decorative signs, lighting, sidewalks, bus 
shelters and landscaping would likely come from city business assessments in 
the future. In the meantime, however, officials would need the Redevelopment 
Agency funds to get the project started. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say that each year an estimated 200,000 people visit Little 
Saigon's hundreds of shops, restaurants and other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The center would offer a place to present cultural shows and provide 
information about the area, helping to attract even more visitors, officials 
predict. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they hope that Little Saigon would be a part of a "Golden 
Triangle" that would include Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm, attracting 
tourists from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee recommends building a hotel, a convention center, and installing 
a shuttle bus service carrying tourists from Anaheim and other places to the 
shops and restaurants in Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 With the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo in Vietnam, Russell said he thinks 
Little Saigon could be a center for trade and contacts with foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westminster Chamber of Commerce and the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce are 
both represented on the advisory committee. City officials said that the 
management of Little Saigon's marketing and promotion would later be passed on 
to an association of local merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Redevelopment Agency approves the proposal today, the money will be 
allocated from its 1994-95 budget in coming months, officials said. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; 3 ARRESTED AFTER SHOTS FIRED FROM CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three women believed to be involved in a gunfight that injured one of them 
were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder early Monday after they 
allegedly opened fire on a news photographer who followed their car from the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested were Tho Minh Luu, 20, of Yorba Linda; Hong Thanh Le, 21, of Santa 
Ana; and Mindy Nguyen Dao, 23, of Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Dao was taken to Western Medical Center in Anaheim, where she was being 
treated for a gunshot wound in the back. Police said the injury did not appear 
life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began shortly after midnight when Glenn Zachman, a 32-year-old 
independent news photographer from Garden Grove, noticed the occupants of two 
cars shooting at each other as they drove near the intersection of Harbor and 
Garden Grove boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 As Zachman began following one of the cars, police said, its occupants started 
firing at him as they drove down Garden Grove Boulevard. The other car 
disappeared, fleeing in a different direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, according to Lt. John Woods, a spokesman for the Garden Grove 
Police Department, the car Zachman was following hit a retaining wall near 
Memory Lane and Flower Street in Santa Ana, where its three occupants were 
arrested by Santa Ana police. 
</P>
<P>
 The photographer was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are searching for the occupants of the other car involved in the 
gunfight. They believe that the incident was gang-related.

OCTA APPROVES FUNDS FOR DISNEY GARAGE; TRANSPORTATION: THE AGENCY, WHICH WILL 
COLLECT PARKING REVENUE FROM THE LOT, PLEDGES $32 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The giant parking structure designed to accommodate the Walt Disney Co.'s 
planned Westcot expansion moved closer to reality Monday when local 
transportation officials approved $32 million toward construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds were approved by the Orange County Transportation Authority and are 
contingent on the agency receiving about $131 million in federal money for 
construction. The total cost of the seven-story parking garage on Clementine 
Street between Freedman Way and Katella Avenue is estimated at $223 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is known as the Orange County Intermodal Transportation Center, 
and officials said it will be at least two years before OCTA receives 
additional federal funds and construction can begin. U.S. authorities also have 
to approve an environmental impact report for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, two years is pretty optimistic. Disney can't begin construction of 
Westcot until the (transportation) center is built, because Westcot is going to 
be built on what is now a Disneyland parking lot," said Lisa Mills, chief 
deputy at OCTA. 
</P>
<P>
 The state approved $30 million in funding last month, bringing to $62 million 
the total earmarked to date for construction. Anaheim has promised to provide 
$10 million for the project, while Walt Disney Co. said it will contribute $20 
million for construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills said that federal authorities have already approved $15.5 million to be 
used for the garage and for other projects on the San Diego and Costa Mesa 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we haven't decided how that money is going to be split," Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim city officials, who see both the Disney expansion and transportation 
project as a boon to the city's economy, voiced support for the OCTA board's 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very pleased with the intergovernmental effort of the project. When 
completed, it will have significant regional benefits and help alleviate 
transportation problems throughout Orange County," said Tom Wood, Anaheim 
deputy city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of the garage have brushed aside criticism that the project is using 
federal funds to benefit Disney, which is privately owned. OCTA officials argue 
that there is also a benefit to the public because the transportation agency 
will keep all parking revenue and commuters will also be getting a transit 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 Project supporters point out the first floor of the garage is designed for 
exclusive use by commuters. The first floor will include an elevated urban rail 
lane that is part of another project, pickup and drop off points for express 
buses and shuttles, and park-and-ride spaces for car-poolers. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the proposed Disney expansion is estimated at $3 billion. OCTA 
officials believe that the expansion will eventually take place and in February 
authorized the construction of freeway ramps on the Santa Ana Freeway leading 
to Disneyland. Like the garage, construction of the ramps is not expected to 
begin for at least two years.

CHARGES THROWN OUT AGAINST 1 IN GEM CASE; COURTS: THREE DOWNTOWN MERCHANTS 
STILL FACE CHARGES IN COMPLICATED TRIAL OVER ALLEGED THEFT OF RARE RUBY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge dismissed a charge Monday against one of four men standing trial in 
the alleged theft of a rare Burmese ruby from a downtown jewelry merchant. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Kathryne Ann Stoltz ruled that there was not 
enough evidence to show that Antranik Harbouian, a 46-year-old Montebello 
resident, had anything to do with an alleged plot to ransom a 6.76-carat 
gemstone worth as much as $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoltz also denied defense motions to throw out charges against the remaining 
three defendants -- all jewelry dealers. While acknowledging that evidence 
against one of the three "is somewhat conflicting," the judge said a jury 
should decide if he is guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 The rulings came after prosecutors wrapped up their case, one that began with 
some fanfare last summer when nearly two dozen law enforcement officials, 
backed up by a police helicopter, arrested five men during a sting operation in 
Encino. (Charges against another of the five arrested were previously 
dismissed.) 
</P>
<P>
 The complicated tale of the ruby began when German gem trader Peter Morlock 
gave the ruby on consignment to Ron Levi in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement called for Levi to either return the stone within two days or 
pay Morlock $527,000. But Levi gave the gem to another broker, Ali Reza 
Paravar, in what defense attorneys contend is a common practice among jewel 
wholesalers. 
</P>
<P>
 When Morlock went to claim the ruby, Paravar refused to turn it over because 
Levi owed him about $300,000, according to Paravar's testimony Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense contends the deal between Paravar and Levi was a separate and 
unique transaction, and Morlock should have taken the matter up with Levi. Levi 
cannot be found and did not testify. 
</P>
<P>
 Paravar, a 42-year-old Woodland Hills man, is on trial for grand theft. The 
two other defendants -- Rasekh Uddin Siddiqui, 46, of Chatsworth, and Behzad 
Saba, 33, of Irvine -- face charges of receiving stolen property for allegedly 
trying to extort $360,000 from Morlock in exchange for the ruby. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbouian, also a Downtown jewelry dealer, introduced Morlock to Saba, which 
set up the chain of events leading to the alleged extortion attempt. Harbouian 
maintained he was only trying to help Morlock, a longtime business associate, 
regain his stone. 
</P>
<P>
 With Deputy Dist. Atty. Eduards Abele trying to a convince a jury that the 
three now on trial conspired to profit from the ruby, defense attorneys 
maintain the real issue is that Morlock got burned in a business deal gone bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is Mr. Morlock acknowledges this is a bad business deal, and 
he would do anything to get his stone back," said defense attorney Michael 
Gottlieb in asking Stoltz to dismiss charges against Saba. 
</P>
<P>
 Morlock initially went to police after Paravar refused to hand over the gem in 
October, 1990, but investigators refused to pursue the case, telling Morlock it 
was a matter best handled with a civil lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Morlock, whose company has possession of the ruby, co-owns the stone with 
Lloyd's of London, the insurance firm that paid him $250,000 when he reported 
that it was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 Before concluding his case Monday, Abele presented evidence indicating that 
Paravar gave conflicting statements concerning the ruby to an FBI agent who was 
investigating Levi in 1990. A Los Angeles police detective also testified that 
Siddiqui, speaking to investigators after he was arrested in July, 1993, said, 
"I had a feeling it was stolen . . . but I wanted to make some money." 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony in the trial is expected to conclude today.

SLAIN RESCUER WAS NORTH HILLS MAN, POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who stopped and rescued a woman from being beaten -- and then was 
allegedly run over by her attacker and killed -- was identified Monday by 
police as Jose Felix Garcia Mercado of North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was kind and generous and would help anyone who needed help," said Raeann 
Mercado, his sister-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Jose Mercado, 37, a construction worker, was driving on Parthenia 
Street near Columbus Avenue about 2 a.m. Sunday in North Hills when he spotted 
a friend, Sylvia Gamez, being beaten by another man. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercado stopped to help her, police said, and she got into his car. The 
attacker, whom police decline to identify, then allegedly followed them in a 
pickup truck. When Mercado stopped and got out of his car to confront him, the 
man ran him over, police said, and then fled the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members said Mercado's body will be flown to Mexico, where he will be 
buried in his hometown of Sombrerete. He leaves two daughters, Trininad, 16, 
and Consuelo, 8. He was not married at the time he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 His sister-in-law described him as being particularly close to his brothers. 
"He loves baseball," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He and his brothers played every Sunday. The team won't be complete anymore."

L.A. BATTLES TO REGAIN CONTROL OVER SECURITY ALARMS; SAFETY: STATE HAS SOLE 
AUTHORITY TO REGULATE THE INDUSTRY, BUT COUNCIL PANEL WANTS AN ORDINANCE TO 
GIVE CITY POWER TO CRACK DOWN ON FALSE REPORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Concerned over the thousands of false alarms that police must answer annually, 
a Los Angeles City Council panel took action Monday to challenge a state law 
that stripped the city of its power to regulate the security alarm industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's Public Safety Committee instructed the city attorney's office to 
draft an ordinance to regulate and fine security alarm companies and crack down 
on the owners of alarm systems that generate too many false alarms. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Marvin Braude, who heads the panel, said the proposed ordinance 
would conflict with state law and would most likely spark a legal battle with 
the state over who should regulate security companies. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said a clash with the state may be the only way to get the attention of 
state lawmakers and force them to change a 1978 law that gives the state the 
sole authority to regulate the security alarm industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Braude said he expects criticism from his council colleagues and others for 
intentionally bringing the city into a legal battle with the state. But he said 
he will move ahead anyway. "I'm not fearful," Braude said. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of how to deal with false alarms was first raised last month by 
Councilwoman Laura Chick, a San Fernando Valley representative, and Police 
Commissioner Art Mattox. The two proposed laws to crack down on the owners of 
security systems that repeatedly issue false alarms to police. Many of the 
systems are not registered with police, as required by city law. 
</P>
<P>
 About 95% of the security alarms answered by the Los Angeles Police Department 
last year were false, triggered either by human error, faulty equipment or bad 
weather, according to police and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Police responded to 153,000 false alarm calls last year, at a cost of $6 
million to $8 million, Mattox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal by Chick and Mattox, owners of alarm systems are fined $80 
for every false alarm after the third call within a 12-month period. The $80 
fine now starts after the fourth false alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance would also crack down on alarm systems not registered with 
police by establishing an $80 fine for each false alarm by non-registered 
systems. The annual registration fee is $30. 
</P>
<P>
 The Public Safety Committee voted Monday to move ahead with the fines proposed 
by Chick and Mattox and at the same time challenge the state law that takes 
away the city's power to regulate the security industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are working together on this," Chick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and city officials say it has been difficult to get owners of alarm 
systems to take responsibility for false alarms because the state also requires 
police to respond to alarms from all security systems, regardless of whether 
they are registered with police or whether they have a history of false alarm 
calls.

TAY CASE PROSECUTION WITNESS ADMITS TO LYING; TRIAL: REVERSING EARLIER 
TESTIMONY, THE FULLERTON MAN SAYS HIS FRIEND DID STRIKE THE HONORS STUDENT WITH 
A BAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A key prosecution witness testified Monday that he initially lied to 
authorities about the 1992 slaying of honors student Stuart A. Tay. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after his arrest, Charles Bae Choe, 18, of Fullerton, told police that 
teen-ager Mun Bong Kang did not participate in the New Year's Eve beating. On 
Monday, Choe told an Orange County Superior Court jury that while Kang was not 
the main assailant, he struck Tay with a bat near the end of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Choe told jurors Monday he lied to protect Kang, his friend of more than two 
years, but changed his story because it was wrong to lie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Truth is the best policy, that's what I was brought up with, that's my 
nature," Choe told the jury. "I thought it was my obligation, my 
responsibility" to tell the truth, he later added. 
</P>
<P>
 Choe has pleaded guilty to first-degree murder for his role in the slaying and 
is the first witness to testify against his boyhood friend, Robert Chan, 19, of 
Fullerton, who faces life in prison if convicted of masterminding the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Marshall M. Schulman, who is representing Chan, spent most of 
the day hammering Choe's credibility. Choe has admitted cheating on his SAT 
test, has admitted pulling a knife during a dispute with a student, and said he 
could not recall -- but did not deny -- reports that he once bragged to a 
female student about using the same knife to kill someone. 
</P>
<P>
 Choe said he has never killed anyone and was probably trying to impress the 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulman then led Choe through some of the details of the killing, peppering 
him with the question: "And is that part of your nature, to do something like 
that?" Choe repeatedly answered "No." 
</P>
<P>
 Three others charged in the case, Abraham Acosta, 17, of Buena Park, Kang, 19, 
of Fullerton, and Kirn Young Kim, 18, also of Fullerton, will go on trial after 
Chan's case concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 The young men are accused of luring Tay to his death because they believed he 
was going to double-cross them in a planned robbery. Tay, 17, of Orange, had 
lied to the youths about his name, age and hometown, and when Chan discovered 
the deceptions, he decided to kill him, prosecutors allege. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay was beaten with bats and a sledgehammer before rubbing alcohol was poured 
down his throat. Duct tape was used to shut his nose and mouth and he later 
died from choking on his vomit, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the plea agreement with prosecutors, Choe was treated as a juvenile 
and sentenced to 25 years to life in the California Youth Authority. He is 
expected to be released in about eight years, when he turns 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Choe contends he played no role in the fatal beating but helped the others, 
including laying out the sheets that Tay's lifeless body was rolled up in. He 
also admitted helping to carry the body to its shallow gave in Acosta's back 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The grave was too small, however, and Tay's legs had to be folded to make the 
body fit, Choe said, adding that he then helped toss dirt on top of the grave.

VALLEY INTERVIEW: NO DUMB BLONDES: DOG FAN SAYS AFGHANS STUNNING, NOT STUPID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Psychology professor and pet trainer Stanley Coren created a few growls of 
disapproval with an excerpt from his forthcoming book, "The Intelligence of 
Dogs," that ranks dog breeds by their intelligence, based on obedience and 
working smarts. 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of the list was the border collie, poodle and German shepherd -- 
ranked first, second and third, respectively. Dead last on the 133-dog list was 
the Afghan hound, which Coren called "a perfect fashion accessory." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Weinraub of Canoga Park, an American Kennel Club-licensed Afghan judge 
and a dog breeder, defended her favorite kind of pet for Times staff writer 
Abigail Goldman. Her Afghans, Julia and Mandy, listened. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are Afghans the dumbest dogs?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Are cats dumb? Cats are independent, cats are mysterious, cats are 
arrogant, but nobody ever refers to them as being stupid. An Afghan is all of 
those same adjectives. He'll mind you if he feels like it; if he doesn't, he'll 
tell you to go to hell. They are very, very bright, but they are independent 
creatures. They don't particularly want to obey you just because you want them 
to. How do they measure a dog's intelligence? What, do they give them books to 
read? There is no way. Dogs instinctively will do things that they were bred to 
do. A golden retriever instinctively is a dog that will run into the water and 
bring back the game to the hunter. He knows how to do this; it's instinct. Each 
group of dogs has a purpose. A terrier is a feisty little thing that was bred 
to flush rodents from holes and burrows and that's what they do. A working dog 
or a herding dog herds the flocks, a hunting dog brings back the game. Afghans 
were bred to hunt wild game on their own with no one telling them what to do. 
The hunter followed them on foot or on horseback, but the dog had to make all 
the decisions about catching the pursued animal on its own. There's no way of 
saying one is more intelligent than another because they do what is in their 
genes for centuries.  
</P>
<P>
 If you wanted a dog to go and fetch your slippers, this would not be a dog for 
you. But if you wanted a dog that was independent and arrogant and exotic, 
you'd want an Afghan. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So how do you know they're smart?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Because they're very clever. By whose scale of points do they measure a 
dog's intelligence? Is a dog intelligent because you say roll over and play 
dead and it does? Or is it intelligent because it figures things out for 
itself. My son had a golden retriever and if I threw a ball into the pool 250 
times, that dog would jump into the pool, get the ball and bring it back to me 
if it were 110 degrees in the shade. The Afghan would look at you like, "What 
are you, nuts? It's too hot I'll go sit in the shade and be comfortable. Why 
should I do that?" The gentleman who wrote the article on dogs' intelligence 
obviously prefers animals who are blindly obedient at any cost and equated this 
with intelligence. He probably also prefers his women in the kitchen cooking 
and cleaning and not questioning any of his decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Afghans were called a perfect fashion accessory. What do you think of that? 
 
</P>
<P>
 A: That's partially true. They are the perfect fashion accessory. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Give me an example of an Afghan's intelligence.  
</P>
<P>
 A: I had a male Afghan years ago that was quite a big winning dog in the show 
ring. He was used for breeding by people from all over the country. When we 
breed females, we use a muzzle on them because I don't want them biting the 
males. It's just a leather muzzle. Well my male was a house dog. I had him in 
my family room one day and I happened to have the muzzle sitting in a cupboard. 
All of the sudden, I felt this paw coming up behind me and batting at me and I 
turned around and there he was sitting with this muzzle in his mouth. Like, 
"OK, bring on the girls, I'm ready." Now, I don't think that's a stupid animal. 
The same animal would want to wake us up in the morning. He had this routine. 
First, he'd gnash his teeth at us, and we'd ignore him. And then he'd take his 
paw -- Afghans are very much like cats, they love to use their paws -- and he'd 
bat at us to wake us up. The third thing he would do was take our blankets in 
his mouth and pull them off of us. He figured that's going to get them up, and 
it got us up every time. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How would you measure smartness?  
</P>
<P>
 A: How clever they are on their own without having to be trained repeatedly. 
And Afghans are very independently intelligent. They have their own keen, wiley 
ways. I don't train Julia to come here, but you call her and she comes to you. 
You call Mandy, she knows she's Mandy, she'll come right to you. My neighbor 
takes care of our dogs when we go out of town and we snood them -- we put hats 
on their ears, the ones we're showing so they don't get dirty -- when we feed 
them. She was taking care of the dogs one weekend and she forgot to snood one, 
and he grabbed the hat and stood there with it in his mouth like, "Hey, you 
forgot to do this. I'm not supposed to eat until I have this hat on."  
</P>
<P>
 One of my dogs, when my kids were little, before we would go to bed at night 
(she slept in our room), she would go into each of the children's bedrooms and 
check them before she'd go to bed. This was every night. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have you ever seen a dumb Afghan?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Have you ever seen a dumb person? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did you know it was dumb?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well it's not something I would necessarily look for, but I'm sure there 
are dumb anything, including humans. I think the man who wrote this book is an 
idiot.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: How would you know if an Afghan were dumb, then, because there's no real 
way to tell?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't know. I haven't had any. If I had an Afghan that was constantly at 
my feet panting and trying to be so eager to please that I could tell it to do 
anything and it would do it, unrelentingly, I would say this is a pretty stupid 
dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So you think golden retrievers are pretty dumb? Because you basically just 
described one.  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think they are the most wonderful, loving, obedient dogs. But I don't 
think they're necessarily innately intelligent. I think they are eager to 
please; there's a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can Afghans be trained?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Of course they can be trained. My son took one of my Afghans through 
obedience. The dog picked things up faster than any of the golden retrievers, 
any of the German shepherds, any of the dogs in the class. He learned it 
immediately. My son never worked with him from one week to the next like you're 
supposed to. But the dog never forgot one thing that he'd learned the week 
before. However, I would never have let them take him off lead because if he'd 
have seen a cat running across the park, he'd have gone to chase it because 
that's what he likes to do. 
</P>
<P>
 I offered my son an Afghan puppy and he said, "Why would I want a dog that 
thinks it's better than I am?" That really sums up the breed. They are very 
independent, they are very arrogant, they are very eager to please themselves 
before they're eager to please you. They like their creature comforts. Their 
favorite thing to do would be to sit at the end of the couch, looking very 
glamorous and looking down their nose at you.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will they chase a toy if you throw it?  
</P>
<P>
 A: They'll chase it, but they may not bring it back. That's no fun. You might 
do it again and it wouldn't want to do it again. 
</P>
<P>
 (Weinraub throws a pink toy for Julia to chase. Julia looks the other way and 
Weinraub retrieves the toy.) 
</P>
<P>
 She's smart enough to get out of a lot of work. All the movie stars are 
geniuses? They only have to be beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 When this man's book comes out, I'll be sure the dogs have an opportunity to 
read it.

LA HABRA MOLESTATION SUSPECT RETURNED TO U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man sought for more than 12 years on suspicion of molesting children in his 
La Habra home has been returned in custody from South Africa and is scheduled 
to be arraigned today, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley H. Jenson is being held in La Habra City Jail on a no-bail warrant, 
after arriving in the custody of U.S. marshals Sunday at Los Angeles 
International Airport, Lt. Wayne Lowry said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an arrest warrant, Jenson is charged with 21 counts of sexual misconduct on 
a minor, and two marijuana violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowry said that La Habra investigators recently learned that Jenson was living 
in Australia under an assumed name and that he planned to travel to Germany, 
via South Africa and England. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of a cooperative effort among the U.S. State Department, the FBI, 
U.S. marshal's office and the Orange County district attorney's office, local 
authorities arrested Jenson when he arrived in South Africa and held him until 
U.S. marshals could return him to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenson is scheduled to be arraigned in Municipal Court in Fullerton today, 
police said.

ILLEGALLY IMPORTED FIREARMS SEIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal agents and Huntington Beach police have seized 410 illegally imported 
Chinese machine guns, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The importer, who is federally licensed to import legal weapons, was neither 
arrested nor identified by federal officials, but police sources said the 
seizure took place at a commercial building in an industrial area. 
</P>
<P>
 Worth an estimated $143,000, the imported guns are incomplete Chinese copies 
of the former Soviet Union's AK-47 assault rifle, which can be easily converted 
to fully automatic capability, said U.S. Customs Agent Joseph Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 Such weapons have been illegal in the United States since 1989. Converted 
rifles with machine-gun fittings are subject to seizure and forfeiture and the 
owner may face a maximum $250,000 fine and 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 John D'Angelo, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms, explained that the seizure was part of "an ongoing investigation, 
which may result in an arrest or arrests in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the Treasury Department announced a crackdown on such weapons, 
telling importers their import licenses were being suspended and private owners 
to contact their suppliers to dispose of the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Customs officials and their counterparts from Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms learned of the arms shipment to Huntington Beach from a confidential 
source, Charles said, after they reached the Port of Los Angeles. When the 
search was conducted in Huntington Beach on Feb. 11, agents found 404 of the 
rifles, three conversion units and two folding blade daggers designed to fire 
.22-caliber bullets from the handle, Charles said. As a result of the search, 
six more rifles were seized at another location, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Importing convertible weapons from China was the subject of an NBC-TV 
newsmagazine "Dateline" segment.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; U. S. INQUIRY OF TRANSIENT'S KILLING CLOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Justice Department's civil rights division announced Monday that an 
investigation of a 1989 case in which a transient died after being shot 18 
times by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies has been closed without any 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 The inquiry, which involved a federal grand jury, examined whether the 
shooting death of Betty Jean Aborn, a black woman, by three sheriff's deputies 
violated federal civil rights law. The incident prompted calls by civil rights 
groups for a probe into alleged police brutality. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department did not provide additional details. Spokeswomen for the 
Sheriff's Department and the U. S. attorney's office in Los Angeles said they 
did not have further information. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aborn case aroused considerable outrage five years ago. It was one of 
three shootings in Lancaster within an eight-month period that prompted 
accusations by the NAACP and others that sheriff's deputies deployed excessive 
force against minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 11, 1989, six deputies confronted the 50-year-old Aborn at a Carl's 
Jr. in a suburban strip of fast-food restaurants and strip malls near the 
Avenue K exit of the Antelope Valley Freeway. Authorities were responding to an 
armed robbery call at a nearby business when they confronted Aborn, who was 
wielding a butcher knife. 
</P>
<P>
 When Aborn lunged at them, three deputies opened fire, authorities said. A 
subsequent investigation by the Los Angeles County district attorney's office 
found that Deputies William Phelton, James Vetrovec and Tony Ortiz acted 
"within the bounds of reasonable self-defense." 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence indicates that the deputies showed considerable restraint" until 
Aborn, who was a suspect in the nearby robbery, lunged at the deputies with the 
knife, the district attorney's special investigations division report said. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer working with relatives of the Antelope Valley shooting victims said 
the ruling showed that the district attorney's office was unwilling to 
prosecute police officers accused of misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could have used nightsticks to knock the knife out of her hands," said 
David Lynn of the Coalition for Police Accountability. "We're talking about an 
indigent, frail, elderly black woman."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 70 STUDENTS QUESTIONED ABOUT TEACHER 
POISONING; CRIME: A LITTLEROCK HIGH SCHOOL OFFICIAL SAYS A CASH REWARD HELPS 
NARROW THE POSSIBLE SUSPECTS TO A FEW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities interviewed about 70 students Monday as they stepped up the 
investigation into the poisoning of a Littlerock High School teacher who became 
violently ill after she took a gulp from a Diet Pepsi can laced with toxic 
dry-eraser fluid. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're interviewing any and all students . . . to determine who did this," 
Littlerock Principal Jeffery E. Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
 No suspects were arrested Monday in connection with the Thursday incident, but 
Foster said that a $200 cash reward offered to students last week for 
information leading to the successful arrest and prosecution of the culprit 
generated several solid leads. He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am cautiously optimistic that we're closing in," Foster said. "We have 
several students we are centering our investigation around right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Ennis, 32, an English teacher, was rushed to the hospital Thursday after 
she took a gulp from a can of soda laced with dry-eraser fluid. She was listed 
in stable condition Monday at Palmdale Hospital Medical Center, where she has 
undergone tests to determine whether her kidneys or stomach have suffered any 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Jerry Wolf said the Diet Pepsi can and the 
dry-eraser container were both submitted to a lab for fingerprint testing. 
Results from the test are expected today. 
</P>
<P>
 Ennis was taking the last sip of a can of Diet Pepsi that she had left 
unattended when she immediately felt a burning sensation in her throat and 
began to vomit. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf said sheriff's deputies planned to interview about 70 students Monday 
from Ennis' first- and second-period English classes. If arrested in connection 
with the poisoning, a student could face charges ranging from attempted murder 
to assault with a caustic chemical, Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster also confirmed that the day after the poisoning, a substitute teacher 
assigned to replace Ennis was shoved by a student in the same classroom. The 
student involved in the incident has been suspended from the school and may 
face expulsion, Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction to the poisoning at the Littlerock campus, located about 70 miles 
northeast of Los Angeles, was mixed in the sense that students were shocked 
that a popular teacher such as Ennis had fallen victim. However, they appeared 
unsurprised that violence had once again struck their campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Students told of numerous food fights breaking out in the school's cafeteria 
and stink bombs exploding throughout the campus in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students have really just been out of control here lately. I mean they have 
been acting really stupid," said one student sitting outside on campus, who 
declined to give her name. 
</P>
<P>
 She and other students, such as sophomore Lafayette Bailey and freshman 
Frankie Culver, said a Friday pep rally ended abruptly after somebody let off a 
stink bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody ran out and the pep rally wasn't even over," Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster said he could not confirm the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Other students said that an escalation in food fights in the cafeteria 
prompted school officials Monday to ban students from eating inside the 
cafeteria and instead had them eat outdoors on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent string of events has prompted parent John Parsons to rethink where 
he wants his daughter Yvette to go to school. Parsons said he is going to look 
into having her transferred to Highland High School in Palmdale next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came out here to get away from the problems," said Parsons, as he sat 
parked outside the school waiting to pick up his daughter. "But they're 
cropping up here too." 
</P>

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; TEEN-AGE INTRUDER UNDER INFLUENCE OF LSD SHOT 
TO DEATH BY HOMEOWNER; CRIME: DESPITE HIS WOUNDS, THE NAKED 17-YEAR-OLD STILL 
LEAPS THROUGH A WINDOW, NEARLY SEVERING HIS LEG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A teen-ager who became crazed after taking LSD died early Monday after being 
shot twice in the upper body by a man whose Lancaster house he was trying to 
enter, sheriff's investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said that not even two bullet wounds stopped 17-year-old Josue 
Oswald Morales from trying to gain access to the house in the 700 block of East 
Avenue J-9. After being shot by homeowner Keith Wood, authorities said Morales 
crashed through a double-paned glass window, nearly severing his leg. They said 
Wood had to wrestle Morales to the ground to contain him while awaiting police. 
Morales died about an hour later, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales, a high school dropout, told his mother a few weeks ago that he was 
unhappy with the direction that his life was taking and expressed an interest 
in turning it around. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew he had some problems, he knew he had some weaknesses," said Morales' 
mother, Margarita Dalessandro, who clutched a baseball cap that her oldest son 
frequently wore. "He was going to take care of them. I guess he won't have the 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want people to think he was some kind of a jerk. He wasn't a jerk," 
she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours before the 1:34 a.m. shooting, Morales "dropped some acid" at a 
Lancaster park where he was hanging out with friends, said his 16-year-old 
brother Joel, who was with Morales Sunday night and up until just minutes 
before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, Morales behaved normally. But when the teen-agers left the park, 
Joel said, Morales began to act strange. Joel said his brother acted just as he 
had at other times while on LSD. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in the wrong state of mind," Joel said. "Things happen with that drug, 
you can't control it." 
</P>
<P>
 Morales' girlfriend dropped the two brothers and a third youth off at a 
friend'a house. "All of a sudden he (Morales) started getting too loud," Joel 
said. "We had to get him out of the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Joel said the trio ended up in a large vacant lot next to Wood's residence, 
just blocks from their own homes. He said they stayed in the tumbleweed-covered 
lot for a couple hours and then Morales became violent and tried to hit his 
friend, who ran away. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel said the two brothers were left alone in the lot. He said Morales 
apologized for what he had done, but then suddenly hit Joel on the side of the 
head. Joel said he then began walking to a nearby store to call 911. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked into his eyes," Joel said. "That wasn't my brother." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood said he knew someone was behind his tract house when his two dogs started 
barking at his back wall about 1:30 a.m. Wood, who lives in the house with his 
wife and 6-month-old daughter, said his first thought was that teen-agers were 
partying behind the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood said he went downstairs and turned his porch light off and on as a 
warning that someone was awake in the house. With the light on, Wood said he 
went upstairs to see if he could spot anyone from the window. He said there was 
suddenly a pounding on Wood's back door that was loud enough that neighbors 
down the block could hear it. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood said he ran downstairs and in hopes of scaring Morales off told the 
intruder that he had called police and that he had a gun. But Wood said Morales 
kept pounding at the rear door, partly breaking the double-pane glass window. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing for his and his family's lives, Wood said he returned upstairs to 
locate a handgun. Wood found the gun, which he said he had never used until 
Monday. But he said he could not remember where he had stored the bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he wanted to kill us," Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Wood was upstairs, Morales stripped off his clothing and shouted 
something about going swimming, an investigator said. The Woods don't have a 
pool. The investigator said Morales left blood from his head and hand on the 
cement patio, which authorities said he apparently had tried to dive into. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood said he found the ammunition and returned downstairs, warning Morales to 
leave or be shot. Wood said Morales broke partly through another window. and it 
was then that Wood said he fired three bullets, hitting Morales twice. Morales 
fell briefly to the ground and Wood called 911. 
</P>
<P>
 When Wood pulled up his window blinds, he said, he saw that Morales was naked 
and figured that he must be on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Wood said Morales ran away. Wood, whose wife and daughter were 
upstairs screaming, said he thought the ordeal was over. But moments later 
Morales came crashing through another window on the side of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy would not go away. He was relentless," Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales nearly severed one of his legs as he came through the window. But 
despite the two bullet wounds to his upper torso, and glass shards embedded all 
over his naked body and blood running from countless cuts, he still tried to 
fight Wood, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The violence was incredible," Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Ray Peavy of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department homicide bureau 
said it is not likely that Wood will be charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales' family said they are not angry with Wood. "He was trying to protect 
his family," said Cesar Morales, the slain teen-ager's father. "If it happened 
the way they say it happened, I would have done the same thing."

 RON CEY 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Cey filled a traditional trouble spot when he became the Dodgers' regular 
third baseman in 1973, a job he kept for 10 years before being traded to the 
Chicago Cubs. Nicknamed "Penguin" for his stout build and his waddling gait, 
Cey helped the club to four National League championships and the 1981 World 
Series victory over the Yankees.He hit 228 home runs as a Dodger, a record for 
the Los Angeles franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Cey is now a sports agent and part owner of Beverly Hills-based Total Sports 
International, which represents about 30 professional athletes. He also makes 
TV commercials. At 46, he still lives in the San Fernando Valley home he bought 
when he was brought up to the Dodgers. BO BELINSKY 
</P>
<P>
 Few athletes have captured the fascination of Southland baseball fans as 
quickly as Bo Belinsky. The brash left-hander pitched the first major league 
no-hitter on the West Coast as a rookie for the expansion Los Angeles Angels in 
1962 and started the season with five consecutive victories. But Belinsky's 
carousing with Hollywood starlets soon caught up with him. He finished the year 
with a 10-11 record and never regained his early form. The Angels traded him to 
Philadelphia in 1965, and Belinsky retired in 1970 with only 28 victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Belinsky, 57, got sober 18 years ago and is the quality-control supervisor at 
an auto dealership in Las Vegas. DAVID W. MYERS

BATTLING BACK; PHILADELPHIA FIRST BASEMAN JOHN KRUK CELEBRATES AN UNUSUAL 
OPENING DAY IN STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER SCHMUCK, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Philadelphia Phillie first baseman John Kruk had to make a stop on his way to 
Veterans Stadium Monday morning, to undergo another in the long series of 
radiation treatments intended to speed his recovery from testicular cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not your typical opening day ritual, but it didn't seem to cramp his 
style. 
</P>
<P>
 Kruk arrived at the ballpark a few hours later and made his 1994 debut with a 
three-hit performance that turned the sellout crowd of 58,627 into his personal 
booster club. The Phillies would lose their home opener, 8-7, to the Colorado 
Rockies, but Kruk put it all in perspective by celebrating life right there in 
front of everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to the starting lineup after playing in three minor league games 
and delivered a run-scoring double in his first at-bat. It was only baseball, 
of course, but it was one of those defining moments in which sport becomes the 
medium for a greater message. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake. Phillie fans are not normally a sentimental bunch. They 
cheered Kruk wildly through a surprisingly productive afternoon that included 
the double, two singles, an RBI and two runs scored, but they booed when 
Pennsylvania Gov. Bob Casey threw out the ceremonial first pitch -- even though 
Casey is recovering from a multiple transplant operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd erupted in a particularly deafening ovation after the first-inning 
double, leaving the rough-hewn Kruk a little embarrassed at all the attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was nice," he said. "I didn't know what to do -- tip my cap or just stand 
there and look stupid. I just stood there." 
</P>
<P>
 If Kruk's ordeal of the past few weeks figured to give him a new perspective 
on the importance of baseball, however, he didn't get philosophical about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not thinking about things like that on the field," he said. "I got it 
(cancer). The doctors are trying to get rid of it. Now it's time to think about 
playing baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Kruk has been given the go-ahead to play regularly, but the team's medical 
staff will be watching him closely for any sign that he is doing too much. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, John is aware of what we don't want to happen as far as having a 
chronic fatigue problem," team physician Phillip Marone said Monday. "He's 
going to have to be honest with us, and I know he will be honest with us." 
</P>
<P>
 It is in Kruk's best interest to be cautious, but it is his nature to be 
reckless. The Phillies have gotten a lot of mileage out of a too-tough-to-care 
attitude, so the club will have to make sure that Kruk does not let his 
reputation as a gamer get in the way of his full recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basic concern is fatigue setting in," Manager Jim Fregosi said. "I will 
monitor him very closely -- if I can get him to tell me the truth. As of right 
now, until we see how much stamina he has, I won't play him in a day game after 
a night game, and I'll probably only play him four or five games a week." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the equivalent of early spring training for Kruk, who played in a 
couple of exhibitions before the cancer was detected. He came back to play in 
three games for the Phillies' double-A farm club in Reading, Pa., before 
proclaiming himself ready to rejoin the major league lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great to have John back," catcher Darren Daulton said. "He's a great 
hitter, a great first baseman and a great leader on this team. He's glad to be 
back. He is a very big part of our team. If you take that off your team, you're 
going to notice the difference." 
</P>
<P>
 The 33-year-old first baseman puts on a gruff persona but has not lost his 
sense of humor. He was asked what he missed most when he was away from the team 
for the past few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys in Reading were great," he said, "but they aren't Dykstra, Daulton 
or Hollins. I just missed the male bonding." 
</P>
<P>
 Kruk has come back about three weeks ahead of schedule, but Marone explained 
that the original timetable for his return was based largely on guesswork. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we talked about in Clearwater was all conjecture," Marone said. "We 
didn't know how many rads (the intensity of the radiation) he would require. 
Beyond the first couple of days, he didn't experience any nausea, and he has 
been able to remain relatively active." 
</P>
<P>
 Kruk was not certain to start Monday's game. He had to do a selling job on 
Fregosi and General Manager Lee Thomas to get them to remove him from the 
disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had discussions," Kruk said. "Their concern was, if I play one game and 
can't play the next two or three, why take me off? I had to do some convincing 
that that wouldn't be a problem . . . and they bit." 
</P>
<P>
 The radiation therapy is nearly complete. Kruk has undergone 16 of the 18 
treatments and is scheduled to finish the regimen this week. But he knows that 
there is the possibility of a recurrence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy," he said, "but just because the radiation is almost over, that 
doesn't mean I'm in the clear. I'll have to get checked periodically for the 
rest of my life."

COMMENTARY; THIS MIGHT BE START OF FALL OF ROME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The black eye Jim Everett had targeted for Jim Rome's face during a talk-show 
confrontation last week missed, regrettably, landing instead on the already 
swollen face of journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 The proliferation of tabloid talk has so blurred the lines of the legitimate 
and the fringe as to raise rightful concerns about the meandering boundaries of 
the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of Rome's sophomoric goading of Everett, which prompted the 
former Ram quarterback to turn the tables on Rome and charge the TV host, it is 
no small wonder many of today's athletes are reluctant to cooperate with media 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Rome, the hip host of ESPN2 and a daily talk radio show on XTRA in San Diego, 
has generally been a refreshing no-nonsense voice in the manic jock-talk 
medium. Rome has created his own cult following with a glossary of sports 
jargon that includes what he calls smack, a synonym for trash talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Rome, in fact, is known as "Van Smack" and prides himself on being on the 
cutting edge. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the Everett incident, Van Smack deserved to get smacked.  
</P>
<P>
 The stunt he pulled was irresponsible and regrettable to those who think 
journalism is something more than a free-speech free-for-all. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps unbeknown to Rome, there are actually guidelines to journalism. Rome 
trampled all over these well-established tenets in the taping of his segment 
with Everett, who recently was traded by the Rams to the New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett is no doubt deserving of examination and criticism. It comes with the 
territory and his $2-million salary. 
</P>
<P>
 And what has happened to Everett since 1989 is indeed bewildering. Maybe it 
was a dream, but wasn't it Everett who led the NFL in touchdown passes in 1988 
and '89? 
</P>
<P>
 And didn't some dare mention his name in the same breath as Joe Montana? 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out Everett wasn't another Montana. So what? 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, Everett deserves to be held accountable for his shortcomings since. But 
no man, woman, child, or quarterback deserves to be humiliated in a public 
forum. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than two years, Rome has caustically referred to Everett on his radio 
show as "Chris," an obvious affront to Everett's manhood. Chris Evert, of 
course, is a former female tennis star. Rome's tag on Everett stemmed from the 
"phantom sack" Everett took in the 1989 NFC championship game, when he 
collapsed in the pocket without having been touched. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett has taken his media lumps ever since. Considering Rome's insults, I'm 
surprised Everett agreed to go on Rome's cable show. 
</P>
<P>
 He did, though, and appeared willing to tackle what should have been tough, 
but fair, questions -- questions that begged to be asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Rome resorted to grade-school taunting, immediately referring to 
Everett as "Chris." 
</P>
<P>
 During his rebuttal on radio the next day, Rome justified that as being up 
front with his guest, given that he had long been calling Everett by that name 
behind his back.  
</P>
<P>
 "Although I regret (the incident), I've called him Chris on radio, on TV, and 
when he came in live studio, I was not not going to call him that," Rome said 
on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward R. Murrow would have been proud. 
</P>
<P>
 Rome, clearly, was out to pick a fight. Calmly, at first, Everett said he did 
not appreciate the disparaging nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 Rome was unrelenting. Everett, starting to seethe, suggested that Rome take a 
station break to settle the matter off the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Rome refused. Everett, now incensed, said he'd bet the host would not use the 
name again. 
</P>
<P>
 Rome, of course, did, at which point Everett turned a table over and pushed 
the host to the floor. Everett then pursued Rome and hovered over him before a 
studio worker separated the two. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a pretty good bet that while cowering on the floor, Rome was no longer 
questioning Everett's manhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the situation, Everett had every right to react. Thankfully, no punches 
were thrown and there were no injuries, other than the gaping wound suffered by 
Rome's credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Rome was knee-deep in damage control the next day, maintaining that Everett 
had known in advance that he was going to be called "Chris" and had agreed to 
come on anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were not lying in wait," Rome said. "We did not ambush him. It was not a 
ploy for publicity. You know the show. He knows the show. He just snapped. 
That's the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
 The closest Rome got to an apology was the admission that he had teased 
"Chris" too hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the third time I said it I was overboard," Rome said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of Rome's Morton Downey Jr. routine, we were denied answers to 
legitimate questions Everett apparently was ready to answer. He had told Rome's 
producers beforehand that he was ready to clear the air on his tumultuous 
eight-year career with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Might that have been more interesting, journalistically, than a pipsqueak 
talk-show host's quest for self-glorification? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, sure.  
</P>
<P>
 But, boy, didn't that fight make a great sound bite? 
</P>
<P>
 In his glossary of terms, Rome refers to his audience as "the jungle." 
</P>
<P>
 In that context, Rome the interviewer must have been "Cheetah."

COMMENTARY; THEY HAD A BIG CHANCE WITH BO AT BAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The home team was down, 9-0, in the middle of the sixth inning, which, on the 
11th of April, could only mean one thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel baseball had returned to Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Long ago, Angel fans grew accustomed to home openers such as this. A rookie 
right fielder from Cleveland named Manny Ramirez hits home runs in back-to-back 
at-bats. A generic brand of starting pitcher, Mark Clark, one-hits the Angels 
through six innings. The Angel shortstop drops a pop fly. The Angel leadoff 
spot produces no runs, no hits, no walks and five strikeouts. Meet Your Angel 
Long Relief Staff becomes the unofficial theme of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Bored with this sort of behavior, Angel fans apparently have decided to change 
theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Booing is out. 
</P>
<P>
 Bo-ing is in. 
</P>
<P>
 It began with a low-level rumble through the field seats in the middle of the 
seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 WE WANT BO!  
</P>
<P>
 WE WANT BO!  
</P>
<P>
 To do what was not immediately clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrap a headlock on the scoreboard operator and persuade him to -- how shall we 
say -- make this problem go away? 
</P>
<P>
 Break out some old Nike commercials to while away the time? 
</P>
<P>
 Step up to the plate and hit his patented 10-run home run? 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels needed nine Bo Jacksons, and maybe another on the mound, to make 
any difference in this one. And yet, the fans persisted. 
</P>
<P>
 BO! . . . BO! . . . BO!  
</P>
<P>
 Buck Rodgers, the Angels manager, gave them Spike Owen. He gave them Jim 
Edmonds. But through 8 1/2 innings, still no Bo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game plan," Rodgers said, "was to get the tying run on before sending Bo 
up there." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the Angels trailed, 9-1, which meant Bo might not be going up 
there until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Bo scoffed when he heard the chants. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're eight runs back," Bo said, "you need two runners on every base." 
</P>
<P>
 The first two Angels up in the ninth went as quietly as can be. Strikeout by 
Edmonds. Strikeout by Dwight Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, a funny thing happened. Tim Salmon walked. And another. Chili Davis 
singled. And another. Owen singled. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 9-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Eduardo Perez walked and Chris Turner struck out, but strike three 
bounded past Indian catcher Tony Pena all the way to the screen. Turner was 
safe at first, Davis was safe at home, the score was 9-3. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Angels' dugout, Mark Langston nudged Bo, most likely with his good 
elbow. "We get two more men on," Langston said, "and you're getting an at-bat." 
</P>
<P>
 Bo refused to believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man, you're (teasing) me," he replied, using a more colorful phrase. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, two more men got on. A bad-hop single down the first base line by 
Harold Reynolds brought in one run. A line-drive single by Gary DiSarcina 
brought home two more.  
</P>
<P>
 The score was 9-6, with Angel runners on first and third. 
</P>
<P>
 Bo Time. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans rose to their feet and roared when their man swaggered out of the 
dugout. A standing Bo-vation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bo knocked the weighted do-nut off his bat and dug in, fully prepared to give 
his people what they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went up there for one reason -- to the tie the game," Bo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't looking for a basehit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking to hit the . . . out of the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone in the ballpark knew it, too, which is why Cleveland Manager Mike 
Hargrove promptly changed pitchers and summoned Steve Farr, a breaking ball 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Bo would be waiting on a fastball. 
</P>
<P>
 Farr would be throwing sliders. Nothing but. Six of them, all told, five 
fading outside and away from the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Bo swung at two, did not swing at three and watched the count go full. 
</P>
<P>
 That meant one more slider. 
</P>
<P>
 That meant one more swing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to swing at anything close," Bo declared. 
</P>
<P>
 The pitch was close. 
</P>
<P>
 The swing was not. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Bo Moment of the 1994 baseball season had come and gone, the Angels 
losing their first million-dollar coin flip of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Heads, Bo homers. Tails, Bo whiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Heads, you tie. Tails, you lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a chance to win or tie in the bottom of the ninth with Bo up at the 
plate," Rodgers said. "Everybody should have walked out of the stadium today 
saying, 'We had Bo Jackson up there, we had a shot.' 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all we want. A shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Bo might have an added request, in case anybody was asking. One fastball in 
the strike zone would have been nice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I knew Steve Farr," Bo said, disgust in his voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he'd challenge me. But he threw me all sliders. 
</P>
<P>
 "This time, it worked out good for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Someone asked Rodgers if he considered calling Bo back after Hargrove brought 
in Farr, realizing full well that Farr was not about to throw Bo anything 
straight or fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers did a double-take. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked my . . . off to get him out there," Rodgers chortled. "Why would I 
take him out?" 
</P>
<P>
 And risk the unyielding wrath of the Anaheim Stadium Bo-birds? 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers, who knows why he's here and why Bo's here and why the fans are here, 
knows better than that.

STRUGGLING DODGERS WERE HITTING IN THE RAIN ON THEIR DAY OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The rain started falling here on Saturday and didn't let up until late Monday 
afternoon, causing the St. Louis Cardinals to postpone their home opener 
against the Dodgers until tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Busch Stadium, which has artificial turf, might have been ready after some 
serious squeegee work in the outfield, but who could see the ball? The weather 
remained foggy, cold and windy, and the skies threatened another downpour 
later. So the day off that was scheduled for today somehow found a purpose, and 
the three-game series will begin tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "An off day will do us good," Dodger third baseman Tim Wallach said. "It could 
be a huge break." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Dodgers, any time away from baseball after last week should be a 
pleasure. First, they misplaced Darryl Strawberry, an event that turned the 
clubhouse into a circus. Then, after finding him and helping him off to 
drug-alcohol rehabilitation, they won their first two games, only to go into a 
tailspin, losing their next four and boarding the plane for an eight-game trip 
with a collective batting average of .158.  
</P>
<P>
 "They are all trying too hard," Coach Bill Russell said. "You hate to see it 
happen all together this way, but they will break out of it. The only guys 
getting on base have been Delino (DeShields) and Brett (Butler). But the other 
guys are just pressing too much. They are all here today, they are just in the 
batting cages." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the players spent time working with hitting instructor Reggie Smith. 
Mike Piazza, Eric Karros and Wallach, who make up the middle of the order, each 
is batting less than .150, with Piazza at .080. 
</P>
<P>
 Not having Strawberry's bat in the lineup between Piazza and Karros is being 
felt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just him not being in the lineup with that imposing presence hurts us," 
Piazza said. "But we can't use that as a crutch. This team has to be strong 1 
through 9 to win." 
</P>
<P>
 With Strawberry gone indefinitely, Piazza is the team's only intimidating 
hitter, a situation he says isn't causing him pressure. "You can say that it 
puts pressure on me, but I'm not feeling it," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 After a phenomenal spring, during which he hit nine home runs, Piazza showed 
his first sign of regular-season power Sunday, when he hit a 460-foot home run. 
He has two hits in 25 at-bats. In that kind of situation last season, he 
probably would have been throwing batting helmets. But this seasonPiazza 
appears calm. He's not happy about his slump, but he is confident it will end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm keeping my patience like a saint, and it's scary," Piazza said, smiling. 
"Of course I get mad, and I'm coming to the park and working hard, but you have 
to roll with the punches. "Last year, there were a couple of times when I was 
two for 30, but when you have a good year like I did (he was National League 
rookie of the year) and then you are cold coming out of the blocks, people want 
to panic. 
</P>
<P>
 "But in baseball, there are so many peaks and valleys and, as a player, you 
have to work yourself out of the valleys. That will happen, and God forbid if 
it doesn't, but it's like I told Eric (Karros), 'There are so many games, so 
many years left.' Going through something like this will help me down the line, 
I need to learn from this, and it will change. I will come out of it."

RAMS GET CHARGER SAFETY POPE, COULD LOSE ELLARD TO REDSKINS

 The Rams, who traded for Charger safety Marquez Pope Monday, appear on the 
verge of losing all-time leading wide receiver Henry Ellard to the Redskins and 
have opened contract discussions with Houston wide receiver Haywood Jeffires. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellard, who has been all but ignored by the Rams this off-season after leading 
the team with 61 catches for 945 yards, rejected an offer from Washington over 
the weekend, but now is considering a new proposal from the team that is 
expected to pay him around $1.8 million for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams paid Ellard $850,000 last season, but are now looking at Jeffires, 
New England's Greg McMurtry, Washington's Ricky Sanders and the NFL draft to 
bolster the wide receiver position. 
</P>
<P>
 To acquire Pope, a second-round pick of the Chargers in 1992, the Rams gave 
the Chargers a sixth-round pick in the 1995 draft on the condition that Pope 
participates in more than 50% of the team's defensive plays this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are also expected to sign former Jets' cornerback Clifford Hicks this 
week, and today they will announce the hiring of Warren Simmons, former 
Washington assistant, to coach the Ram tight ends. T.J. SIMERS

KNOWING WHAT PROBLEM IS HELPS LANGSTON PREPARE FOR CURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For more than four years, Angel team orthopedist Dr. Lewis Yocum has kept a 
loose watch on the "loose bodies" in Mark Langston's left elbow. Monday 
morning, he decided they would have to be removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston, who has been on the disabled list only once during his 10-plus major 
league seasons, will have surgery for the first time in his life at about noon 
today at Centinela Hospital in Inglewood. Yocum is hoping he'll only have to 
remove a couple of those loose bodies -- bone chips -- in an arthroscopic 
procedure that could allow Langston to resume his spot in the rotation by the 
last week in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've known about the bone chips since he came here," Yocum said, "but there 
are a lot of pitchers out there with bone chips and they're not a problem until 
they become symptomatic. For the first time, Mark's chips are now floating 
around and causing trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Yocum said a preventive procedure in the off-season -- or before Langston 
signed a three-year, $14-million contract in February -- was never considered. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew it was something that could occur, but it wasn't like we were waiting 
around to jump into surgery," Yocum said. "He hadn't missed a start in five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We periodically checked it (with X-rays), but there were no previous 
indications or warnings. It's the 'If it ain't broken don't fix it theory.' If 
the chips aren't bothering him, it's pretty hard to talk a guy into a surgery." 
</P>
<P>
 Langston, who saw his bone chips on the X-rays taken after he was first 
examined in Minnesota, said he was "pretty much geared up" for Monday's news 
that surgery would be required. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm actually relieved because now that I know they're there, now that I've 
seen them, I would just as soon have them taken out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston felt no discomfort last Tuesday during or after his victory opening 
day, when he pitched 7 2/3 innings. He thought maybe bumping the elbow on a 
chair in his hotel was a factor, but it wasn't until the next day that the 
elbow "locked up" in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Banging it on the chair may have been a minor factor," Yocum said. "Pitching 
baseballs is probably the major factor." 
</P>
<P>
 Yocum, who performed similar procedures on former Angel pitchers John 
Candelaria and Kirk McCaskill, said if everything goes as expected and there is 
no ligament or nerve damage, there is every reason to believe that in six weeks 
Langston will be the same pitcher he was before the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll know more when we get in there and see how many pieces and how many 
changes there are in the elbow," Yocum said. "But if there is no other damage, 
then the percentage of pitchers who come back throwing as hard as ever is 
relatively high. 
</P>
<P>
 "Later this week, we'll begin working on his range of motion and then start 
him on exercises next week. And Mark has an advantage in that he's both 
well-conditioned and physically strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "He asked me how soon he could get on the bike and I told him he could start 
on Wednesday." 
</P>
<P>
 Langston said he is neither afraid nor worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been very fortunate to go as long as I have without a major injury," he 
said, "and the chips are in the back of the elbow, in an easy place to get to. 
And the way it happened, the way they just sort of fell into place while I was 
walking, isn't as scary as if I'd thrown a pitch."

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: CHANGING OF TRANSFER POLICY WILL CONFOUND CIF 
OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The CIF, deeply involved in strategic planning and marketing endeavors, is 
putting things on hold as it tackles yet another potential problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in July, public school students in California will be allowed to 
transfer to schools within their districts, space permitting. Beyond that, an 
open-enrollment policy might also be allowed between some districts as early as 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 Those policies are creating havoc for CIF officials, who have strict transfer 
rules. Eligibility is generally granted only when there is a legal change of 
residence or when a student receives a special permit. The new "choice" law 
threatens to change that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The CIF doesn't want to be out of compliance with the new law, but we're also 
concerned with the school shopping of athletes," said Margaret Davis, CIF 
associate commissioner. "There are a lot of unanswered questions, and there has 
been much internal debate over this subject. It's all very complex." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Fleming, superintendent of the Placentia Unified School District and a 
member of the CIF Federated Council, said he expects the CIF to amend the 
eligibility rule by adding that a transfer student will be denied immediate 
eligibility if the move is solely for athletic purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we can legally completely deny eligibility, but we can try to 
ensure students don't transfer just for athletics," Fleming said. "It won't be 
easy to enforce, but it isn't easy now." 
</P>
<P>
 The rule amendment is being reviewed and will be presented to the CIF 
Federated Council on May 6 in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating the issue is that the CIF's 10 sections can further amend any 
state rule. Fleming also said districts might have different policies regarding 
open enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials fear open enrollment could result in the building of all-star teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our section would likely require that all (open-enrollment) transfers be made 
before the start of the school year," said Dean Crowley, Southern Section 
commissioner. "This avoids athletes transferring during their season of sport." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Tom Salter, 32, the new football coach at La Puente Bishop Amat, has a strong 
family background in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Richard, was a longtime football coach at Arcadia High, retiring 
in 1990. The school's stadium is named in his honor. His brother, Tim, has been 
the football coach at Montebello Schurr the last six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been helping my sons since I retired and I will continue to do so," 
Richard said. "I break down game film, scout the opponent and whatever else 
needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Salter replaces Mark Paredes, who resigned two weeks ago after eight 
successful seasons. Paredes, 84-14 at Bishop Amat, is taking over the football 
program at Riverside North. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Amat, which competes in the Catholic Del Rey League, has one of the 
area's most successful programs. The Lancers set a state record for victories 
in 1992, going 15-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Salter is the guy I wanted to take over," said Daylon McCutcheon, a 
returning receiver-defensive back and a top recruit. "He really cares about his 
players on and off the field." 
</P>

 Ken Haslip of Pasadena Muir, coming off an impressive performance in the 
Arcadia Invitational on Saturday night, will compete in the Mt. San Antonio 
College Relays this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior, voted Arcadia's male athlete of the meet, will run the 110-meter 
high hurdles, 300 hurdles and on the 400 and 1,600 relays on Saturday. Haslip 
leads the nation this season in both hurdles events with times of 13.94 in the 
110 and 36.98 in the 300. This is his first year running the high hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 Also scheduled to compete are national leaders Scott Slover of San Jose Leland 
in the pole vault, Michael Granville of Bell Gardens in the 800, Pat Johnson of 
Redlands in the 100 and 200, and Jeremy Fischer of Camarillo in the high jump, 
among others. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the high school events are scheduled Saturday, beginning at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Coach Mike Ryan gave his South Gate baseball team last Friday off as a way of 
apologizing for his recent scheduling blunders. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan unwittingly entered his team in the Babe Herman tournament in Glendale 
during the same week it had a busy conference schedule. The result was five 
games in four days and a lot of headaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Things got especially complicated last Tuesday when South Gate had a home 
conference game against Fremont at 3 p.m. and a semifinal tournament game 
against Van Nuys Montclair Prep at Glendale at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to split my squad in two," said Ryan, in his seventh season. "After the 
Fremont game, we hustled the rest of our team over to Glendale. It got a little 
hectic." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan's Rams won both games, though, to improve to 9-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next year, I'll plan things out a little better," he said. "My kids were a 
little drained." 
</P>

 Leodes Van Buren, an all-state receiver from Newbury Park, was arrested Friday 
for allegedly shooting a gun into his girlfriend's home. He was released on 
$5,000 bail later that day. Van Buren, who has signed with Colorado, told The 
Times he was at the scene but denied pulling the trigger. The bullet lodged in 
a wall near the back door. No one was injured. . . . Jocelyn Chase of Agoura 
cleared 10-6 in the pole vault at the Arcadia Invitational, establishing a meet 
record for girls. Chase narrowly missed an attempt at 11-2. The event has only 
been contested for two years and is still an exhibition sport . . . Shawn 
Adams, a 5-foot-5 senior, hit a two-run homer in the top of the eighth inning 
to lift Newbury Park to an 8-6 upset of Simi Valley last Wednesday.

<P>
 Ricky Price of Gardena Serra scored 12 points and Jelani Gardner of Bellflower 
St. John Bosco added 10 in Magic Johnson's Roundball Classic on Sunday before 
10,100 at Auburn Hills, Mich. Price and Gardner were members of the West team 
that lost to the East, 141-135. . . . The spring signing period for prospective 
college athletes begins Wednesday and continues for one month. Several top area

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; LOSS OF LANGSTON LEAVES TEAM QUESTIONING ITS PROSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The earthquake-damaged scoreboard is not scheduled to be replaced at Anaheim 
Stadium until late summer. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Angels opened their home season amid the usual panoply Monday, the 
gaping cavity in the stadium's left field upper deck seemed symbolic. 
</P>
<P>
 With Mark Langston scheduled for elbow surgery today, followed by six weeks of 
rehabilitation, there is a comparable cavity in an Angel rotation that wasn't 
the deepest or most stable even before the sobering Langston situation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of Brian Anderson's unexpected and uplifting performance in 
Milwaukee on Sunday and the promise of a 4-2 trip against the Brewers and 
Minnesota Twins, the American League Central's two weakest teams, there was a 
hint of the cold reality that faces the Angels and their Langston-less rotation 
in the home opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-hander John Dopson, who pitched seven shutout innings in a 4-1 victory 
over the Twins on Wednesday, lasted only 5 1/3 innings in this one, gave up 
eight hits and six runs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cleveland Indians, a regenerated power in the realigned Central, built a 
9-1 lead, then survived a five-run Angel ninth to win, 9-6. 
</P>
<P>
 It came down to Bo Jackson, who struck out on a Steve Farr slider for the 
final out while representing the tying run. 
</P>
<P>
 The concern, of course, is that the Angels could be looking at budget-type 
deficits on a consistent basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Their rotation, Manager Buck Rodgers acknowledged, was in something of an 
experimental and trial phase, Langston or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Angel starters, Dopson and Mark Leiter, are coming off arm surgery and 
were released by their previous teams. Phil Leftwich was 7-7 in triple A last 
year and 4-6 with the Angels. Anderson, the No. 1 draft choice of last June, 
was pitching for Wright State a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Southpaw Joe Magrane might be ready to rejoin the rotation in early May, but 
he is recovering from elbow surgery for the second time in four years and has a 
Major League record of 22-31 since the start of the 1990 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to fool anyone," Rodgers said. "We're not blessed with 
Atlanta's pitching, but we think we can get by for six weeks. It's not going to 
be easy, but we'll have to work through it. We need Langston in the second 
half, and I think it's thrown a challenge at the rest of them. I think that's 
the way they look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 The manager has to paint it the best way he can. He has to hope the mental 
impact of Langston's loss doesn't beat the Angels even before Anderson and the 
others deliver a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was worried about that in Milwaukee and still am some, but the thing Brian 
Anderson did was to come in and say, 'Hey, it's not as bad as you think,' " 
Rodgers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, it's not a good feeling to have one of your horses go down, but it 
helps to have the guy replacing him make an immediate contribution." 
</P>
<P>
 The questions go beyond Anderson, of course, but if the 21-year-old southpaw 
pitches as he did against Milwaukee, he can help Chuck Finley ease the pressure 
on Dopson, Leiter and Leftwich. 
</P>
<P>
 Special assignment scout Bob Harrison, who saw Anderson pitch three times for 
Wright State last year, said Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason I think he can pitch up here so soon is that he throws strikes 
whenever he wants to. He makes it look easy. I don't think I've ever seen a 
young pitcher with better command, and he has more confidence than five guys 
should have." 
</P>
<P>
 Said General Manager Bill Bavasi: "I don't want to bank everything on the way 
he pitched in Milwaukee, but it's also a fact that he almost made the club out 
of spring training. We're not afraid to send him out there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, of course, have no choice. Not only do they lose Langston, they 
have to hope their top prospect, their only prospect close to being ready, can 
digest this force feeding. Bavasi said he is following the market, but there 
are virtually no pitchers available. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the mental impact of the Langston loss, he said: "That's a 
legitimate question. I've thought about it, but don't know what to do about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mark has stepped up so often that I'm sure the others hope they can step up 
for him, and the first guy (Anderson) did a great job." 
</P>
<P>
 Dopson wasn't as successful. He stood at his locker later and said Langston 
represented a significant loss, "but you try not to think about it. There's 
enough pressure without thinking you have to fill his shoes. I mean, you hope 
to be able to pick up the slack, but you can only do the best you can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Will this group's best be good enough? That, too, is a legitimate question.

THESE GUYS CAUSE TWICE THE TROUBLE; BASEBALL: CLARK AND RAMIREZ, TWO NEW 
INDIANS, GIVE ANGELS FITS DURING HOME OPENER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Clark and Manny Ramirez, the fresh-scrubbed faces of the Cleveland 
Indians, seized opening day at Anaheim Stadium and made it their own, 
terrorizing the Angels at every turn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels couldn't stop either. They couldn't hit Clark, couldn't get Ramirez 
out in a 9-6 loss Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, Cleveland's starter, gave up one run and two hits with five strikeouts 
and two walks in seven innings. It was 9-1 when Manager Mike Hargrove replaced 
Clark to start the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, playing right field, singled in the third, hit a two-run home run to 
left in the fifth and hit a three-run homer to right in the sixth. It was the 
second time in his brief career that he homered twice in a game and his five 
runs batted in is a personal best. 
</P>
<P>
 So just who are these guys? 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Manager Buck Rodgers, wondering that Monday morning, got his answer 
sometime around 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know who the masked man in right field was," Rodgers said, "but 
we'll sure remember his name after this." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels knew Clark, but only because they defeated him twice last season. 
</P>
<P>
 So, for the record, here's the book on Clark and Ramirez: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Clark, 25, is a former member of the St. Louis Cardinals' organization, who 
appeared in 26 games for the Indians last season. He was 7-5 with a 4.28 
earned-run average, remarkable statistics only because they're so unremarkable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just feel when I go out there I have it in my mind that I'm going to get 
some runs," said Clark, making his first start this year. "And I know with my 
stuff I can hold down other teams." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ramirez, 21, was the New York City Public High Schools' player of the year 
in 1991. Last season, he batted .340 at double-A Canton-Akron, .317 at triple-A 
Charlotte and .170 in 22 games with the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was one of my best games," said Ramirez, hitting .429 with three homers 
and eight RBIs in 14 at-bats. "I'm a line drive hitter. I'm feeling more 
comfortable without putting any pressure on myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Together they buried the Angels and made a fan of Cleveland catcher Sandy 
Alomar. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy throws a lot of strikes," Alomar said of Clark. "He's going to be an 
outstanding pitcher. He's very smart for a guy that young. He throws so many 
pitches." 
</P>
<P>
 When Clark's slider went south at times on Monday, he turned to his 
split-finger fastball. When the split-finger fastball wasn't working, he 
returned to the slider. 
</P>
<P>
 All the Angels managed against him were Dwight Smith's first-inning double and 
Chili Davis' seventh-inning homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Things got ugly as the Angels rallied with five runs in the ninth off 
relievers Eric Plunk and Jose Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez was gone by then, too, replaced by Wayne Kirby in the seventh. If 
there's a knock on Ramirez, it's his fielding. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez's hitting ability, however, is not being questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 "To hit the ball to all fields like that . . ." Alomar said. "All he has to do 
is build confidence. You saw what kind of power he had to the opposite field. 
That's what I like to see is that opposite-field power."

CARLSON BROTHERS COMMIT TO SCC TO PLAY BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kevin Carlson and his younger brother, Brian, made oral commitments to play 
basketball at Southern California College, Vanguard Coach Bill Reynolds said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin, a 6-foot-5 forward, was a two-time All-Orange Empire Conference 
selection for Fullerton College.He averaged 14 points as a sophomore and 17 
points as a freshman, finishing with 1,044 points, ninth best in Fullerton 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian, who will finish his freshman year at Cal State Fullerton this spring, 
was a walk-on but did not play. He averaged 19 points and 10 rebounds as a 
senior at Katella High in 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel both can come in and play immediately," Reynolds said.

REAGAN CENTER PLANS CONFERENCE; POLITICS: GEORGE SCHULTZ WILL SPEAK AT FIRST 
MAJOR EVENT, FOCUSING ON TRANSFORMATION IN FORMER EAST BLOC STATES. 
</P>

<P>
 After several fitful starts, the Ronald Reagan Center for Public Affairs will 
hold its first major conference at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library next 
Monday, featuring former Secretary of State George Schultz as the keynote 
speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference, entitled "Perils of Democracy," will focus on the economic and 
political changes taking place in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, 
said Lynda Schuler, deputy director of the Center for Public Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Other participants include Andrej Olechowski, foreign minister of Poland, and 
Eileen O'Conner, chief of Cable News Network's Moscow bureau. Reagan himself 
will not attend because of scheduling problems, Schuler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuler said the conference, which is open to the public, is designed to give 
participants an up-close look at the democratic efforts mounted behind the 
former Iron Curtain. Each panelist will participate in a question-and-answer 
session with the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference is the first to be held at the center under new Director 
Richard Norton Smith, who was unavailable for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A renowned historian, Smith replaced former Director John Midgley in November 
after the center's board decided to drop its plans to develop a public policy 
think tank in favor of sponsoring more popular and event-oriented programs. As 
a result, several conferences planned by Midgley were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea was to take the center out of the realm of academia and to the 
general public, which is more in keeping with Ronald Reagan's philosophy," 
Schuler said of the center's change in direction. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, political commentator George Will launched the center's new 
speakers' series known as the Reagan Forum. Will's speech on the Reagan 
Administration drew more than 200 people and was broadcast on C-SPAN. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hope that future conferences will also be run on cable television, 
although there are no arrangements currently to do so, Schuler said. However, 
she said, each conference will be taped and made available to local schools and 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's next conference, entitled "Do Conservatives Have a Sense of 
Humor?" is scheduled for May 17 and will focus on how humor is used in 
campaigning, Schuler said. Those scheduled to speak are former Reagan Press 
Secretary Lyn Nofziger, author P.J. O'Rourke, and former Vice President Dan 
Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
 Also participating will be the "Capitol Steps," a group of congressional aides 
who perform musical satire about life in the nation's capital. Tickets for the 
humor conference are $40. 
</P>
<P>
 If his schedule permits, Reagan is expected to attend the conference, Schuler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information or reservations for the "Perils of Democracy" conference, 
call (805) 522-2977. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The conference, to be held in the auditorium of the Ronald Reagan Library near 
Simi Valley, is scheduled for 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday and is open to the 
public. Admission is $20 and includes a buffet lunch. About 200 seats are 
available, and reservations are recommended.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: ENTER HOUSE OF BLUES, NEXT BIG SHRINE TO MUSIC, 
MERCHANDISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some chief executives take their counsel from boards of directors. Others rely 
on brain trusts, or their spouses. Isaac Tigrett has an Indian swami named Sai 
Baba. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hard Rock Cafe co-founder credits Baba, his spiritual adviser, with 
persuading him to take a second run at the restaurant business after he flirted 
with retirement. "He said Hard Rock was high school," Tigrett recalled, "and 
now it's time to go on to the university." 
</P>
<P>
 Tigrett's higher education has come in the form of the House of Blues, which 
hopes to do for the blues what Hard Rock did for rock 'n' roll memorabilia. 
After successful launches in Cambridge, Mass., and New Orleans, the third House 
opens May 3 on West Hollywood's Sunset Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 House of Blues is a departure from Hard Rock -- it celebrates a historic 
musical culture instead of pop culture and is largely based around live 
entertainment. But Tigrett, who grew up listening to the blues in Tennessee, 
has the same global aspirations for the restaurant-nightclub and has already 
ventured into merchandising, publishing, radio and TV production and a 
soon-to-be announced record deal, in addition to supporting a blues foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of the endeavor range from comedian Dan Aykroyd (who calls Tigrett a 
visionary) to the investment arm of Harvard University. House of Blues Inc., 
the corporate entity, raised $32 million through a private placement handled by 
Montgomery Securities last year, and it plans to go out with another 
$10-million private placement later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 While the blues has never enjoyed the same level of popularity as rock or rap, 
especially in a trendy city like Los Angeles, Tigrett says that's reversible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in the Northern Delta region, and I felt deeply the influences of 
that world," said Tigrett, who has had to fight off accusations that he is 
ripping off African American culture. "I also saw that culture dying. These 
locations will become beacons for that cultural expression." 
</P>
<P>
 Tigrett hopes to bring about his blues renaissance partly by showcasing in 
live performances the historic links between pioneers of the form such as 
Robert Johnson and modern-day groups such as Aerosmith (an investor) and Z.Z. 
Top. 
</P>
<P>
 House of Blues doesn't release sales figures, but sources say the venture is 
going well so far. If the company continues to meet expectations, Tigrett plans 
to go public by the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those who believes in his vision is Jheryl Busby, president of Motown 
Records. Busby ended up as a House of Blues board member after initially 
approaching Tigrett for advice on a themed restaurant chain Motown is 
considering. 
</P>
<P>
 He says House of Blues' rigid devotion to cultural authenticity -- including 
its "juke joint" design and plaster cast ceilings featuring the images of blues 
legends -- separates it from chains that capitalize on current trends. "It's 
far beyond anything I've ever seen," Busby said. "It really does entertain, 
educate and serve as a shrine." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever the iconoclast, the 45-year-old Tigrett conducts much of his business on 
a private railroad car done up in a classic Indian motif. Sitting on a plush 
embroidered couch during a recent interview inside the car at Union Station, he 
is dressed totally in black in homage to his guru and is buffeted by the twin 
sensations of burning incense and blaring blues music. A picture of Baba rests 
alongside artifacts rescued from a maharajah's palace. On his left wrist are 
two watches. One, which works, is for telling the time. The other, which 
doesn't, is a gift from Baba. 
</P>
<P>
 After living the rock 'n' roll lifestyle for years, Tigrett is now a settled 
father of four, married to Ringo Starr's ex-wife, Maureen. He has a home in Los 
Angeles, but still considers London his primary residence, at least when he's 
not traveling in his private railroad car. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends say Tigrett's natural shrewdness is tempered by serenity since he got 
religion. He casually refers to Baba as "my master," and says that "it's pretty 
fantastic to have a saint as a business adviser." 
</P>
<P>
 Tigrett's devotion to Baba is such that he does business in multiples of nine, 
the guru's chosen number. Thus, the $9-million investment in the West Hollywood 
House of Blues branch, and the New Orleans branch's address: 225 Decatur St. 
</P>
<P>
 His exotic nature might scare off investors if Tigrett hadn't already 
demonstrated such a flair for merchandising with Hard Rock Cafe, which he and 
Peter Morton founded in 1971. The restaurants became a global phenomenon before 
Tigrett sold his interest in the business for a reported $30 million in 
personal gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Tigrett's returns from the sale angered some public investors, who claimed 
they were shortchanged. But Tigrett said the price was set by the market. 
Whatever the controversy, he had no trouble lining up new investors for House 
of Blues two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest outside stake is held by Aeneas Group, the private investment wing 
of Harvard University's deep-pocketed Harvard Management Co. A partner, John 
Sallay, said the group was "very excited" when Montgomery Securities brought 
them together with Tigrett. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did our due diligence, financial modeling and talked to more people than 
Isaac knows he knows," Sallay said. "We concluded that while it was certainly 
not a sure thing, it was an exciting investment opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 While "a few of the people at stodgy old Harvard were concerned" about 
Tigrett's unconventional style, Sallay added, "we could tell pretty quickly 
that Isaac had a creativity, a spark, an entrepreneurial flair that you really 
don't see that often." 
</P>
<P>
 One concern for any investor is a saturation of themed restaurants, which 
include Hard Rock, Planet Hollywood, Harley Davidson and others. But Laurie 
Lively Smith, a restaurant analyst with Seidler Cos. in Los Angeles, said such 
chains historically have done well. 
</P>
<P>
 "These restaurants tend to not have the same earnings as typical restaurants, 
because they do an inordinate amount of merchandise sales," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for opening the next House of Blues in New York in February. Then 
it will spread to Paris, London, Las Vegas and Chicago. That rapid expansion 
brings inevitable comparisons to Hard Rock Cafe, but Tigrett says there's one 
big difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not interested in being the McDonald's of blues -- or the Hard Rock of 
blues, for that matter," he said. "It's much more diverse than that. We want to 
be the greatest live music hall in America."

PILOTS UNION, CITING SAFETY CONCERNS, URGES S.D. AIRPORT RELOCATION; AVIATION: 
RENEWED PROPOSALS THAT LINDBERGH FIELD OPERATIONS BE SHIFTED TO NAVAL AIR 
STATION HAVE DRAWN CRITICISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Air Line Pilots Assn. called Monday for the closure of Lindbergh Field, 
saying San Diego's downtown airport is unsafe, overcrowded and fraught with 
"inadequacies (that) are insurmountable." 
</P>
<P>
 The statement comes at a time when the future of the airport has again become 
a hot local issue, dividing local residents and the business community. Some 
groups advocate that the airport be moved to the site of Miramar Naval Air 
Station. Others, including two U.S. congressmen, say the airport should stay 
put. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement from the pilots union may be designed to influence a June 7 
advisory vote set by the San Diego County Board of Supervisors on whether to 
relocate the airport to Miramar if the military vacates the site 10 miles 
northeast of downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballot measure was opposed by San Diego's mayor and City Council, who 
feared the vote would send the wrong message to the Navy, long a valued 
economic presence in San Diego and the surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy spokesman Doug Sayers said Monday that the ballot measure is academic 
because the military has no intention of leaving the 24,000-acre Miramar site. 
Only a presidential order could force the military to move, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 42,000-member pilots association has previously expressed its 
dissatisfaction with Lindbergh Field to the Federal Aviation Administration, 
spokesman Bob Flocke said. The union issued the strong statement Monday because 
the airport "can no longer be upgraded to meet current or future air traffic 
demands." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have realized for some time that Lindbergh has been developed all that it 
can be developed," Flocke said, adding that although the length of its runway 
is adequate, there is little "margin for error." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have problems with the terrain, the mountains around it. If any airport is 
ever (likely to be) fogged in, it's Lindbergh," Flocke said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilots believe that "the concept of using Miramar Naval Air Station as a 
civil or joint-use facility, as San Diego organizations have advocated, has 
much merit and should be explored fully." 
</P>
<P>
 But San Diego's business leaders are ambivalent about moving the airport to 
Miramar, especially if it means irritating the military. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Ruggles, the military affairs director for the Greater San Diego 
Chamber of Commerce, said it should be left to the Navy to decide Miramar's 
fate. San Diego Economic Development Corp. Vice President Ron Phillips said 
that "long-term, many people feel that Lindbergh won't be the ultimate solution 
for this community." And Reps. Duncan Hunter (R-El Cajon) and Randy (Duke) 
Cunningham (R-San Diego) oppose the use of the air station as a commercial 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Miramar, currently home of the Navy's Top Gun fighter pilot training school, 
will become a Marine air station later this year and absorb many of the planes 
and personnel from the Tustin and El Toro Marine Corps air bases, which are 
being closed.

MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: DINERS' CLUBS; FAST-FOOD CHAINS TEST REWARDS FOR 
REGULAR CUSTOMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 There's one thing that keeps Diana Bullen returning to the McDonald's 
restaurant inside the shopping mall where she works. 
</P>
<P>
 Free McFood. 
</P>
<P>
 Every fifth time she buys something -- even a cup of coffee -- at the 
McDonald's inside the Paramus Park Mall in northern New Jersey, she receives a 
coupon for a free menu item of comparable cost. Since Bullen is a cashier at a 
clothing store near the McDonald's, she stops there several times a week -- 
usually for a McChicken sandwich. Said Bullen: "I wish all McDonald's had the 
same deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Fast-food industry consultants say her wish may soon become reality -- not 
just at McDonald's, but across the fast-food industry. Much like the free plane 
tickets that major airlines flaunt to lure frequent fliers and establish 
customer loyalty, the fast-food industry giants may also use free food to coax 
value-hungry customers into eating at their restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "No customer is going to eat three meals a day at McDonald's," said Raj 
Chaudhry, consulting editor at Restaurants & Institutions magazine. "But the 
concept of giving free food to frequent customers is a good one. The question 
is, will people buy into it?" 
</P>
<P>
 That's what all the fast-food chains are trying to find out. After two years 
of industry test-marketing at both the franchise and company store levels, 
several fast-food companies are gearing up to expand the programs at local and 
national levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardee's is setting up a special division to test the program at some 
company-owned stores. Arby's, which has been experimenting with a 
frequent-customer program for two years, plans to expand it this year.  
</P>
<P>
 The McDonald's franchisee in northern New Jersey is so pleased with the 
program that it plans to expand it to five more outlets this year. 
</P>
<P>
 And while McDonald's spokespersons declined to comment about the chain's 
national plans, industry analysts say the company is closely monitoring its New 
Jersey franchisee because the king of fast food is considering testing the 
program on a larger scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, officials at Burger King and KFC are also closed-mouthed about 
their plans for frequent-diner programs, but a Burger King franchisee is 
testing a program in New York state, as is a KFC franchisee in western Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once one of the major players gets into it in a big way -- and shows some 
success -- everyone else will jump on board," said Robert Sandelman, founder of 
Sandelman & Associates, a fast-food consulting firm based in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 These high-tech frequent-customer programs are a far cry from familiar pizza 
parlor punch cards, where customers get free pizzas for every 10 visits. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the fast-food chains are testing plastic cards with magnetic strips -- 
much like credit cards -- that with one swipe help the chains learn more about 
their best customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer databases track where customers live, what items they prefer, even 
how much they spend each time they go to the outlet. The chains then use the 
information to target their most frequent customers with coupon mailings at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are many potential pitfalls. Chief among them: Unlike the airline 
frequent-flier programs, where the rewards are substantial, there is some 
question whether occasional free burgers or french fries are enough to turn 
fickle consumers into frequent customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is little loyalty in the fast-food industry," Sandelman said. When 
people get hungry, they usually prefer to eat at the closest place, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also some question whether the financial lure is big enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not going to get many people to change their dining habits for rewards 
that are only worth pennies," said Ron Paul, president of Technomic Inc., a 
Chicago research firm. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fast-food analysts note that the programs are costly to administer and could 
force chains to raise food prices. But fast-food executives say that has not 
been the case in test markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, it may be very difficult to coax people to carry more plastic in their 
wallets. And if the process of running the cards through the high-tech 
equipment adds to the waiting time, it might irritate customers more interested 
in saving time than a few pennies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing like this has ever been done in the fast-food business," said Nick 
Karousatos, director of business analysis at Arby's, which is the clear leader 
in testing frequent-diner programs. "There are still a lot of issues to be 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Since late 1992, Arby's has signed on 64,000 "Club Arby's" members in four 
cities. Customers not only receive coupons for free food, but also accumulate 
points for prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to get free food, customers with the cards are returning to the 
participating Arby's nearly 30% more often than before the program was tested, 
Karousatos said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the McDonald's in Paramus Park, customers see their names flash in lights 
on the cash register's computer screen after their frequent-diner card is 
entered. Some 28,000 frequent-customer cards have been passed out since the 
program began two years ago, said Mike Leoce, manager of the franchise unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost everyone who works in the mall has one of these cards." Leoce said. 
"If you give customers something for free, they are bound to come back."  
</P>
<P>
 Besides the free food, frequent diners at the unit can also receive free 
McDonald's-related merchandise, such as Ronald McDonald watches. And frequent 
diners are automatically entered into drawings for even bigger prizes, such as 
$100 McDonald's food certificates. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardee's will begin testing the concept later this year. It hopes to establish 
a program that doesn't require frequent customers to carry plastic membership 
cards, said Neil Cafasso, director of marketing research at Rocky Mount, 
N.C.-based Hardee's. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, Hardee's has a nifty name for its program: Frequent Fryer 
Club. Briefly . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-based Fotouhi Alonso Advertising has been named agency of record 
for Air L.A., the Los Angeles airline that flies to smaller markets in 
California and Mexico. The account is less than $1 million. . . . Los 
Angeles-based La Agencia de Orci has been selected by MCI to help develop 
Spanish-language broadcast and print ads targeting Latino businesses. . . . 
Electronic Retailing, a new publication about the electronic marketing 
industry, is being published by Van Nuys-based Creative Age Publications.

 Ever wonder who eats the most fast-food? Here's a demographic profile of adult 
fast-food customers in Southern California. The telephone survey of 600 
customers was taken in the last quarter of 1993. Percentages refer to the 
number of respondents who said they eat fast food at least once a month.

 Cracking down on what they consider a rapidly growing area of investment 
fraud, state authorities said Monday that they have raided and shut down 
several operations in Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties selling 
allegedly illegal investments in wireless cable television ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 The investment promoters at the core of the case have taken as much as $30 
million from more than 3,000 investors starting as far back as August, 1992, 
according to State Corporations Commissioner Gary S. Mendoza, whose agency 
conducted the raids last week in conjunction with officials of four other 
states. Many of the investors, he said, were elderly people and others not 
sufficiently sophisticated to put their money in such risky ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 The selling of interests in wireless cable ventures around the country has 
become fertile ground for fraud in recent years, industry observers say. In 
November, Robert L. Schmidt, president of the Wireless Cable Assn., the 
industry trade group, called the scams "nefarious" and a "cancer on the 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
 The field has attracted unscrupulous promoters in part because it is 
relatively easy to enter and largely unregulated. Wireless cable differs from 
conventional cable television in that subscribers receive TV signals via an 
antenna-like device installed at their homes, rather than through physical 
cables. 
</P>
<P>
 Wireless cable has also become a fraud-ridden area because unscrupulous 
promoters have largely exhausted the possibilities of other types of 
investments, observers say. Furthermore, Southern California is traditionally 
known as the telemarketing fraud capital of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the cases involved in last week's raids, promoters promised financial 
returns of more than 600% over five years at low risk, Mendoza said, calling 
that an implausible return given they were taking sales commissions of 38% to 
50% of the money invested. 
</P>
<P>
 They also used television infomercials, cold-calling of prospective investors 
and other high-pressure sales techniques to entice people to invest, he said. 
Mendoza cautioned that a full determination of the legitimacy of the ventures 
-- and any possible criminal charges -- must await further examination of the 
materials seized from the offices. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement issued from its Newport Beach headquarters, however, the 
chairman of one of the firms insisted his company is legitimate and will be 
"exonerated of any wrongdoing whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
 Jon E. Marple, chairman of Newport Beach-based Micro-Lite Television and a 
principal of two other firms involved in the crackdown, called the raids 
"heavy-handed" and said his firm is "a leader in the wireless cable industry." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been active in the overall development and success of this dynamic 
new technological advance," Marple said, adding that Micro-Lite has been the 
general partner of two wireless ventures in Boston and Baton Rouge, La., that 
were later sold to third parties.  
</P>
<P>
 Micro-Lite on Monday became a publicly traded company on the Nasdaq market, 
spokesman Mario (Ike) Iacoviello said. He said the company acquired a shell 
corporation in a deal that allowed it to go public without an initial stock 
offering. 
</P>
<P>
 Marple was otherwise unavailable for comment Monday, as was Richard A. 
Weintraub, a San Diego lawyer whose law offices and affiliated companies were 
also raided last week. Agency officials said a firm associated with Weintraub 
received a "desist and refrain" order last June to cease selling virtually 
identical investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The raids were conducted by officials of the corporations department and 
regulatory bodies from Arizona, Kansas, Missouri and Illinois at 10 Orange and 
San Diego county locations associated with Marple's Marrco Communications of 
Newport Beach and with Weintraub.  
</P>
<P>
 Marple and Weintraub were not charged with a crime, although two telephone 
salespeople at Emerging Technologies Group, an Irvine firm associated with 
Weintraub, were arrested and charged with a misdemeanor count of making 
telephone sales without having been registered with the state. They were 
identified by a Corporations Department spokeswoman as Charles A. Murphy and 
Collin J. Procton. They could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza said his agency believes the raided enterprises may have been 
violating state law by selling unlicensed securities -- the cable system 
interests -- and may also have misrepresented the nature of the investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The disposition of much of the $30 million is unknown, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The main advantage of wireless cable television is that it can serve customers 
unable or unwilling to hook up via cable. For the system operator, the 
technology has the virtue of being exempt from regulation by local 
municipalities, unlike cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire industry is an outgrowth of 1983 and 1985 decisions by the Federal 
Communications Commission to reallocate for commercial use 11 television 
channels previously reserved for video conferencing and educational television. 
The FCC distributed licenses for these and other reallocated channels on a 
first-come, first-served basis, meaning the applicants needed to put up no 
money or show any qualifications to use them. 
</P>
<P>
 Once up and running, wireless cable systems can be legitimate competitors of 
conventional cable systems. Experts say, however, that wireless cable operators 
face the obstacle of accumulating rights to enough channels in any given 
locality to compete effectively.  
</P>
<P>
 "You can tell a lot about the legitimacy of a wireless venture by how many 
channels it has," said Paul Sinderbrand, legislative counsel to the Wireless 
Cable Assn.  
</P>
<P>
 "In any market, a wireless operator has to accumulate more than 20 channels" 
to be competitive, he said, noting that the licenses must be bought from the 
holders or leased. "A lot of the bucket shops don't have 20 channels; they may 
have four, and you can't make a cable service out of four channels of 
television." 
</P>
<P>
 This complexity also makes it hard to assign a value to any given wireless 
venture, meaning that unscrupulous promoters can freely overstate their 
systems' financial potential.

CALIFORNIA VIES AS SITE FOR PROPOSED NASA COMPLEX; AEROSPACE: THE STATE IS 
BIDDING AGAINST AT LEAST TWO OTHERS FOR $2-BILLION PAIR OF WIND TUNNELS THAT 
WOULD TEST AIRCRAFT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A cross-country economic competition is shaping up between California and at 
least two other states over the site of a proposed $2-billion wind tunnel 
complex for testing commercial aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 The financially pressed National Aeronautics and Space Administration has not 
even won White House or congressional approval for the project, but NASA 
administrator Daniel Goldin got an early sales pitch Monday from California 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair of futuristic wind tunnels, designed to replace part of the nation's 
antiquated network of 35 such facilities, would be high on technology but low 
on permanent jobs. About 200 full-time positions would result, Goldin said. The 
project would also generate up to 2,000 construction jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the facility is intended to bolster the nation's big plane builders, 
Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp., in what has become a heated global 
competition in the commercial aircraft market. 
</P>
<P>
 Wind tunnels use enormous fans to push air over the surface of plane models, 
simulating flight conditions and testing aircraft designs that are created on 
computer screens. If built in California rather than one of the competing 
states -- which include Virginia and Vice President Al Gore's home state of 
Tennessee -- the wind tunnels would be erected at NASA's Ames Research Center 
at Moffett Field in Mountain View, where nine older tunnels already operate. 
</P>
<P>
 California's congressional delegation, the office of Gov. Pete Wilson, key 
legislators such as Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, and Bay Area companies -- 
notably Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which would supply power to the tunnels -- 
have been lobbying NASA to build the facility at Moffett. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the modest number of direct jobs involved, the new tunnels would 
presumably strengthen long-term competitive prospects for the U.S. aerospace 
industry, heavily concentrated in California, where defense cutbacks have 
caused severe damage to the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an important step in converting California's economy from one which 
relies on defense spending to one which thrives on high-technology," said 
Assemblywoman Barbara Lee (D-Oakland), chairwoman of the state's Defense 
Conversion Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 California has been roundly criticized for tardiness in competing with other 
states for jobs in high-technology and other fields, and more than 700 firms of 
all kinds have moved facilities out of the state in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the state has jumped in before there is even a project to compete 
for, Brown said. Incentives to lure the tunnels here are under study. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't even decided to build the wind tunnels," Goldin said, "but I'm 
happy to see some signs of life here in California. A number of years ago, 
California wouldn't engage in anything like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Companies such as McDonnell Douglas, Boeing, Lockheed, Pratt & Whitney and 
General Electric have lobbied for years for new wind tunnels. Though NASA has 
historically footed the bill for such aeronautic infrastructure, the agency's 
budget was slashed 30% last year, and it is leaning on private industry to help 
pay for the new tunnels.

THRIFT IS TARGET OF $100-MILLION LAWSUIT BY PAIR OF DEVELOPERS; REAL ESTATE: 
ACTION AGAINST FIRST NATIONWIDE FINANCIAL COMES AS ITS OWNER, FORD MOTOR CO., 
ATTEMPTS TO SELL THE S&L.

 Two Los Angeles-area home builders have sued First Nationwide Financial Corp., 
alleging that the San Francisco-based savings and loan is attempting to 
sabotage their operations by seizing control of thousands of single-family home 
lots in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court last week and made public 
Monday by Santa Monica-based Paragon Homes and American Beauty Homes of Los 
Angeles, seeks more than $100 million in damages from First Nationwide, a Ford 
Motor Co. subsidiary that is up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 First Nationwide declined to comment on the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford is expected to announce shortly the winning bidder for First Nationwide, 
which has fallen on hard times in recent years. The deadline for final bids was 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the lawsuit could complicate or delay the bidding process, it stands 
little chance of scuttling a sale, analysts said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if a lawsuit turns out to be pretty serious, a buyer can always factor 
its potential liability into the price that it offers, or it can insist that 
the seller assumes any future liability for damages," said Jonathan Gray, an 
S&L analyst for Sanford Bernstein & Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas-based Madison Financial, Oakland-based Golden West Financial Corp. and 
a partnership of Chatsworth-based Great Western Financial Corp. and investment 
giant Lehman Bros. are among those that are believed to have submitted bids for 
First Nationwide. All declined to comment on the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Paragon and American Beauty allege that First Nationwide failed to provide 
promised funding for several housing developments in Los Angeles, Orange, 
Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Bardellini, an attorney for the developers, said Monday that First 
Nationwide has used "similar heavy-handed tactics" to take control of projects 
involving as many as 30 other joint-venture partners around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see a pattern of (First Nationwide) forcing developers out of business," 
Bardellini said. "First Nationwide is taking the prime properties and building 
them out themselves" to make more money. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that First Nationwide wrongfully terminated joint ventures 
with the builders and transferred control of the projects to FN Development 
Co., its home building subsidiary in Irvine.  
</P>
<P>
 The developers maintain that First Nationwide's failure to provide funding for 
their projects will have a "detrimental if not disastrous" effect on their 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the suit, joint ventures involving First Nationwide and the two 
developers generated more than $700 million in sales during the past 20 years. 
American Beauty reported $21 million in sales during 1993 and Paragon reported 
$25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Paragon has eight projects under development in conjunction with First 
Nationwide, including the 1,636-unit Seco II project in Santa Clarita and two 
others with a combined 3,300 homes in Victorville, a Paragon spokesman said. A 
spokesman at American Beauty declined to comment.

 Short-Term T-Bill Rates Mixed: Rates declined for three-month bills and inched 
up for six-month bills at auction.The Treasury Department sold $12.4 billion in 
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 3.63%, down from 3.71% last 
week. Another $12.2 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount 
rate of 4.03%, up from 4.02%. The three-month rate was the lowest since it 
averaged 3.5% on March 28. The six-month rate was the highest since it averaged 
4.19% on March 30, 1992. The new discount rates understate the actual return to 
investors: 3.72% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for 
$9,908.20, and 4.17% for a six-month bill selling for $9,796.30.

TRUCKING FIRM SHUTS DOWN, LAYS OFF 2,000; STRIKE: CHURCHILL LINES SAYS TEAMSTER 
DEMANDS WOULD BE TOO COSTLY. BUT PRESTON BREAKS RANKS AND AGREES TO NEGOTIATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Missouri trucking firm on Monday closed its doors and laid off more than 
2,000 workers on the sixth day of a nationwide trucking strike while the 
Teamsters called off the walkout against another company that agreed to resume 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Trucking industry officials blamed the strike involving about 75,000 Teamsters 
for leading Churchill Truck Lines to permanently shut down after nearly 70 
years in operation. More companies and jobs could be lost if the strike 
continues, industry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been predicting for months that lost revenues from a strike would 
lead to lost jobs," said Arthur H. Bunte Jr., president of Truck Management 
Inc., which represents 22 trucking firms struck by the Teamsters. "Because the 
Teamster leadership would rather walk than talk, this prediction, sadly, has 
become true." 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Churchill, president of the family-owned company, told Dow Jones news 
service the firm decided to close Monday because it would not be able to 
operate profitably under wage and work rules sought by the Teamsters. Churchill 
officials were not available Monday for further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Teamsters said Churchill was a victim of longstanding financial and 
operating problems unrelated to the strike. Spokeswoman Nancy Stella said the 
approximately 1,500 Teamsters at the Chillicothe, Mo.-based firm agreed to a 
10% wage cut last August to help the financially troubled firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a company that has been headed down the tubes for a long time," 
Stella said. "The problems that led Churchill to this spot lay clearly at 
management's doorstep." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, another trucking firm -- Preston Trucking -- broke ranks with Truck 
Management Inc. and agreed to separate negotiations. As a result, the 3,400 
Teamsters members at Preston will return to work, effectively leaving 20 firms 
involved in the strike. Preston and Yellow Freight Systems are owned by the 
same company, but Yellow Freight said it has no plans to resume negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts said that many of the smaller firms involved in the strike 
are vulnerable. However, the four largest and by far biggest employers -- 
Yellow Freight, CF Motorfreight, ABF and Roadway -- are capable of withstanding 
a strike lasting several months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roadway can outlast the Teamsters. CF has other sources of other revenues and 
Yellow has better financial resources," said trucking industry analyst Paul R. 
Schelsinger at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette. 
</P>
<P>
 No formal talks are scheduled between the Teamsters and Trucking Management 
Inc. Negotiations broke down March 31 over management's proposal to expand 
part-time positions in their terminals and to make greater use of railroads. 
Management also wants to use binding arbitration to settle grievances.

SOUTHWEST IS FIRST IN AIRLINE QUALITY SURVEY; CONSUMERS: THE DALLAS-BASED 
CARRIER PASSES AMERICAN IN PERFORMANCE RANKINGS. TWA SHOWS THE GREATEST 
IMPROVEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Southwest Airlines surpassed American Airlines to become the No. 1 major 
carrier in overall quality during 1993, according to a study released Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not so much that American performed worse," said Brent Bowen, director 
of the Aviation Institute at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. "It's just 
that Southwest performed better." 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth annual study, a joint effort between the Nebraska researchers and 
the National Institute for Aviation Research at Wichita State University in 
Kansas, found that total airline quality dropped slightly in 1993 from the year 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though (quality) scores continued a downward trend, they do reflect a 
more stable industry over the past 12 months," said Dean Headley, faculty 
research associate at the Wichita State institute. 
</P>
<P>
 The research ranked nine airlines with annual operating revenue of $1 billion 
or more on 19 factors, including on-time performance, baggage handling, how 
often people are "bumped" from flights, fares and frequent-flier programs. The 
factors are weighted based on customers' comments on what is most important to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 TWA continued its recovery from bankruptcy by showing the greatest 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest came out on top in baggage handling, on-time performance and 
frequency of low fares, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Southwest is noted by many airline observers as the nation's model air 
carrier," Bowen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas-based Southwest, the nation's seventh-largest carrier in terms of 
passengers, praised its 13,500 employees for the top ranking. The airline 
emphasizes direct flights from smaller airports instead of huge connecting 
hubs, as well as fewer in-flight services and lower fares. 
</P>
<P>
 "It validates what our employees strive for on the job," spokeswoman Ginger 
Hardage said. "We're hitting on all cylinders." 
</P>
<P>
 American, based in nearby Ft. Worth, had been No. 1 for the first three years 
of the study. Spokesman Tim Smith said the airline's mission is different than 
Southwest's. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a significant difference," Smith said. "Our service tends to be 
full-service, long-haul flights that are a little more traditional. I think 
both airlines do a good job." 
</P>
<P>
 United Airlines drew the worst score for mishandled luggage, with an average 
in 1993 of almost 65 mishandled pieces per 10,000 passengers. The researchers 
attributed that in part to United's hub system, which includes busy O'Hare 
International Airport in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 American was tops in having the fewest passengers bumped, while Southwest had 
the worst figure. Headley said that was partly by design and is compensated for 
by the high frequency of available Southwest flights for bumped passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are denied boarding, you've got another plane in half an hour," 
Headley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst on-time performance belonged to Delta Air Lines, at 77%. The 
industrywide average is 82%. 
</P>
<P>
 TWA, whose main hub is St. Louis, showed the greatest overall improvement, 
rising to No. 7 from last place in 1992. The airline, which recently emerged 
from bankruptcy, is doing better across the board, Bowen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone flying TWA recently can see a renewed commitment to quality service," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 TWA has been heavily advertising an increase in legroom for coach seats, a 
move accomplished by simply removing some seats that often went unsold. How 
They Rank 
</P>
<P>
 Here is how the nation's nine largest airlines compared during 1993 in on-time 
performance, bags mishandled and average number of passengers bumped from 
flights. The figures are part of the annual airline quality study by 
researchers at Wichita State University in Kansas and the University of 
Nebraska at Omaha. The airlines are listed in order of overall quality ranking. 
The mishandled-bags and denied-boarding categories are per 10,000 passengers.

 Survey Puts Insured Quake Damage at $5.3 Billion: A.M. Best Co., the Oldwick, 
N.J.-based insurance ratings agency, estimated that insured damage from the 
Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake will reach at least $5.3 billion and could climb 
as high as $6.4 billion. The figure substantially exceeds the insurance 
industry's official $4.5-billion estimate released last week by the American 
Insurance Services Group. Best based its projection on a survey reflecting data 
from 145 insurers representing 96% of the California property insurance market.

 Regulator Seeks Undercover Mutual Fund Checks: Comptroller of the Currency 
Eugene Ludwig proposed having the federal government use "testers" to check 
whether banks, brokerages and mutual fund firms are adequately warning 
customers of the risks of mutual funds. He called on the heads of the other 
three bank and thrift agencies and the head of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission to form a task force to develop uniform procedures for looking into 
sales practices by all institutions that peddle funds.

 Semiconductor Book-to-Bill Ratio Unchanged: The Semiconductor Industry Assn.'s 
closely watched ratio was 1.13 for March, unchanged from the revised number for 
February.The February book-to-bill was revised downward from 1.15. A ratio of 
1.13 indicates that for every $100 in semiconductor shipments to the U.S. 
market, chip makers received $113 in new orders. A ratio above 1 indicates that 
the market is expanding. Analysts had expected the number to be between 1.16 
and 1.20 in March. Bookings, based on a three-month moving average, were 
$2.7215 billion, up 2.8% from $2.6482 billion in February.

 20th Century Rethinks Strategy: Facing $325 million in earthquake claims and 
the loss of one-fourth of its capital and surplus, 20th Century Insurance Co. 
is likely to try to expand outside of Los Angeles to lessen the financial risk 
of another big earthquake, analysts say. The Woodland Hills-based insurer 
declined to comment on its plans but announced that it has doubled its 
catastrophe reinsurance coverage to $200 million.

EASING OF ANTITRUST BARRIERS TO DEFENSE MERGERS URGED; PENTAGON: BUT TASK 
FORCE, IN REJECTING AN OUTRIGHT EXEMPTION FROM THE LAW, ASSERTS RIGHT TO INVOKE 
NATIONAL SECURITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Pentagon task force has recommended that antitrust barriers to defense 
industry mergers should be relaxed, but rejected industry calls for an outright 
exemption from antitrust laws, according to officials familiar with a report 
that will be released today. 
</P>
<P>
 The report asserts that the Pentagon should invoke the issue of national 
security to protect defense industry mergers, even if those mergers might be 
blocked under conventional antitrust regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 As Pentagon spending continues to fall, the pace and size of defense mergers 
and acquisitions will continue to grow, creating serious new policy issues for 
the Pentagon, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon report, written by a Defense Science Board task force, is already 
attracting harsh criticism both from those who assert it goes too far in 
advocating an accommodating posture toward mergers and from industry officials 
who had sought an outright exemption from antitrust rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really need an exemption if you are going to get rid of excess capacity 
in the defense industry," said Donald Hicks, a Washington defense consultant 
and former under secretary of defense. "It is ridiculous to worry about 
antitrust now." 
</P>
<P>
 When the government blocked a proposed merger between Olin Industries and 
Alliant Techsystems several years ago, advocates of a rapid industry downsizing 
said the action would only hurt both of the companies and set a bad precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Department of Justice is trying to apply conventional antitrust standards 
to an industry in which nothing fits the conventional economic mold," said 
Loren Thompson, a defense expert at Georgetown University. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thompson's view, the government holds significant power over the defense 
industry as the sole customer for its products, and enormous financial barriers 
exist to other companies entering the defense market. As a result, the industry 
should not be treated in the same way as soft drink manufacturers or retailers, 
he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 But Daniel Brian, director of the Project on Government Oversight, said the 
defense industry already has enormous political power over the Pentagon and 
consolidation will only enhance that clout. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Pentagon has not been taking seriously the danger of downsizing in such a 
way that allows a monopoly to develop in every market sector," Brian said. "We 
are going to end up with a mega corporation in every market." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian's group, which submitted written statements to the task force, also 
harshly criticized the make up the task force, which included defense industry 
attorneys and Loral Chairman Bernard Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is inappropriate that Schwartz should be on the study at all," she said, 
noting that Loral is one of the most active companies acquiring other 
contractors.

FIRMS TO UNVEIL COMMERCENET, MARKET IT AS COMPUTER WORLD'S HOME SHOPPING 
NETWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of leading Silicon Valley companies are to announce today that they 
are bringing their version of the home shopping network to millions of users on 
the worldwide computer network known as the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 In what is seen as a major attempt to commercialize the ad-hoc network, the 
companies are launching CommerceNet, allowing users to buy computers, scan 
catalogues and bid on contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be an electronic marketplace emanating from Silicon Valley," 
said Steve Harari, president of Enterprise Integration Technologies Corp. who 
is acting as the network's project manager. 
</P>
<P>
 CommerceNet is backed by $12 million in seed money, including half from the 
federal government, and has attracted such companies as Apple Computer Inc., 
Sun Microsystems Inc., Lockheed Corp. and Bank of America, all of which are 
based in or near the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Internet is a 20-year-old collection of computer networks from around the 
world that was once the preserve of advanced computer users. 
</P>
<P>
 It now attracts a variety of personal computer users -- about 20 million of 
them. The network is increasingly cited as either a forerunner, or the future 
backbone, of the so-called information highway. 
</P>
<P>
 It is envisioned that consumers will shop for thousands of products at home or 
the office by scanning huge databases with a computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery Securities analyst Betty Lyter predicted on-line shopping will be a 
major draw for consumers and companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Opening an outlet on an electronic shopping service would be analogous to 
setting up shop at the local mall," she wrote in a report. 
</P>
<P>
 While a number of the networks are still very much in the planning stages, the 
Internet is up and running and has a rapidly growing and relatively affluent 
clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 Harari said the potential for the commercial network is enormous. "We're not 
sure how it's going to evolve. It could include everything from pizza parlors 
to real estate." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he expects the service to be backed by 50 to 100 companies by the end 
of 1994. Companies offering services on CommerceNet will pay $25,000 a year for 
a high-level membership, but lower-priced memberships will also be available. 
</P>
<P>
 Internet users, after tiring of roaming cyberspace for more serious work, will 
be able to sign on to a special address to access CommerceNet. Once logged on, 
a computer user can scroll through various company directories. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, a user will also be able to employ special computer "agents" to 
help scan the database for the best computer chip or the latest sound board. 
</P>
<P>
 CommerceNet will make available a special computer program called Mosaic to 
help the average user navigate the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 The system will also employ technology to scramble messages and other methods 
to ensure orders and protect credit card numbers.

 Technology: Time Inc. said Monday that Cable News Network will be part of the 
news-on-demand service it plans to make available later this year to its cable 
subscribers in Orlando, Fla. The service will offer news, sports, weather, 
personal finance, health and feature material over TV screens.The deal greatly 
increases the amount of material that will be available to subscribers to the 
so-called Full Service Network of information, entertainment and 
telecommunications being developed by Time's parent, Time Warner Inc. Time is 
setting up a test of the network this year in 4,000 homes in Orlando. The 
network is also expected to include movies on demand, games, home shopping and 
other interactive, or two-way, TV services. The company hopes to expand the 
network nationwide. CNN, the all-news cable network owned by Turner 
Broadcasting System Inc., is the first outside news organization to be signed 
for the new service. The deal runs through mid-1996 and is non-exclusive, 
meaning CNN will be free to make its programs available on other systems.  
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Time Warner said it will restructure three of its game and 
multimedia units -- Time Warner Interactive Group, Atari Games Corp. and Tengen 
Inc. -- to operate under the common name Time Warner Interactive. The New 
York-based conglomerate currently owns 79% of Atari Games, whose wholly owned 
subsidiary, Tengen, develops cartridge-based video games for Sega of America. 
Burbank-based Twig develops and publishes CD-ROM software. Under the new 
arrangement, Time Warner plans to develop and publish interactive consumer 
entertainment software for a variety of platforms.

FCC REVIEWING HOW MURDOCH BOUGHT STATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Communications Commission, in an unusual move, is revisiting a 
controversial 1986 decision that allowed media baron Rupert Murdoch to take 
control of seven TV stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Murdoch acquired the stations from Metromedia Co. eight years ago and used 
them as the cornerstone to build Fox Television Stations Inc.'s fourth network. 
In order to comply with limitations on foreign ownership of broadcast licenses, 
the Australian-born Murdoch became a U.S. citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, prompted by a complaint from the New York branch of the NAACP, the FCC 
has reopened the case and asked interested parties to submit comments. The 
group contends that Australian-based News Corp., Fox's parent, is the ultimate 
owner, which would be a violation of FCC restrictions on foreign ownership.  
</P>
<P>
 The issue is one Murdoch cannot afford to treat lightly. The seven stations -- 
since grown to eight, with an option for a ninth -- broadcast to 19.3% of the 
country's TV homes and are a crucial source of cash flow for the company. 
</P>
<P>
 News Corp. executives say the issue raised by the NAACP is bogus because 
Murdoch, whose family owns 32.7% of News Corp. shares, exerts de facto control 
of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ownership structure of Fox TV Stations Inc. and all of the issues 
relating to it were fully resolved by the FCC in 1986," said Preston Padden, 
senior vice president of News Corp. "There is absolutely no substance to the 
arguments advanced by the NAACP." 
</P>
<P>
 News Corp. structured the acquisition by vesting in Murdoch 51% of the TV 
station subsidiary's preferred stock and in Fox Chairman Barry Diller 25% of 
the preferred stock. Murdoch acquired Diller's preferred shares when Diller 
left the company about two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue may be how preferred stock in this case is treated -- whether, as the 
NAACP argues, it is more like debt or whether, as News Corp. claims, it is 
equity. Also in question is how Murdoch can distinguish between his role as 
chief executive of News Corp. and the controlling shareholder of Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 One communications attorney predicted it would be "difficult to rule against 
Murdoch at this point." However, in a potentially troublesome clause, the FCC's 
rules specifically allow for the revocation of licenses if they are found to 
violate foreign ownership limitations.

RELATIONSHIPS: HOW TO APOLOGIZE -- WITHOUT REGRETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE BAWDEN DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To effectively give and receive apologies, experts suggest keeping the 
following tips in mind: 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't be afraid to apologize. You aren't endangering yourself or your 
relationship by saying you're sorry.What will harm your relationship is a 
failure to apologize. 
</P>
<P>
 * Create a non-threatening atmosphere in which to give and receive apologies. 
</P>
<P>
 Use "I" statements when apologizing so that the other person doesn't feel 
threatened or have the urge to attack back. 
</P>
<P>
 When people apologize to you, simply accept it and move on. If you harp on 
them about what they did and rehash what happened, they will be hesitant to 
give you an apology in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 * Empathize with the person you hurt. Part of being able to effectively say 
you're sorry is the ability to realize how the other person is feeling. Putting 
yourself in his or her shoes really helps. 
</P>
<P>
 * Realize that while you are responsible for apologizing for your actions, you 
are not responsible for how people feel about what you've done. You cannot be 
held accountable for creating another person's feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't make empty promises. If you apologize for something, it is important 
that your behavior coincides with the apology. If, for instance, you say you're 
sorry for being late and continue to be tardy, your apology becomes 
meaningless. JULIE BAWDEN DAVIS

 I'll never forget when I was in grade school and a friend and I decided to do 
some artwork on the side of a randomly chosen mailbox. Although the event 
seemed almost insignificant as we scribbled on the side of the metal box with 
permanent markers, giggled and rode off on our bikes, it wasn't so 
insignificant later that night when my friend opened her big mouth and told her 
parents what we'd done. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an especially significant event when my father came running into my 
room after getting a call from her parents with his 
you've-really-done-it-this-time look. In addition to being placed on 
restriction for the rest of my life, I had a far worse fate bestowed upon me. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to those poor people's house right now and apologize," he 
yelled. "Put on your coat and get in the car!" 
</P>
<P>
 He drove me to the victim's house, marched me up to the door and made me ring 
the bell. When a woman answered, I blurted out, "I'm sorry I wrote on the side 
of your mailbox. I don't know why I did it, but I'll pay for a new one." 
</P>
<P>
 My heart sank at what she might say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I appreciate the apology, young lady," she said, "and thank you for 
offering to pay for the mailbox, but we were already planning on getting a new 
one, so you don't have to worry about it."  
</P>
<P>
 As relief washed over me, I thanked her and left. 
</P>
<P>
 To this day, apologizing has not been as hard for me as it was that night, 
perhaps because I know that not saying you're sorry is much worse. All I have 
to do is recall the dread I felt as my father, with an unmoving frown, drove me 
to my victim's house.  
</P>
<P>
 There are probably no two words that hold more power than "I'm sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 "If an apology is sincere, it can be very powerful, because it validates the 
feelings of the hurt person," says Kimberlee Hancock, a marriage-family-child 
counselor with KAH & Associates in Tustin. "Being sorry indicates that the 
apologizer realizes that he or she made a mistake and created emotional harm 
and is willing to take responsibility for doing so." 
</P>
<P>
 While the words I'm sorry can be potent, more often than not people hesitate 
to say them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people fight saying they're sorry because they have a hard time 
admitting they are wrong," Hancock says. "Other people get hooked into the idea 
that they didn't mean to do whatever it is they did, so they don't have to 
apologize." 
</P>
<P>
 Many people can't say they are sorry because they perceive a real or imagined 
loss of respect. They fear no longer being seen as perfect and losing power and 
control, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Men often avoid saying they are sorry because they think that if they admit 
they are wrong, their significant other will see them as vulnerable and less of 
a man, Hancock says. Women, on the other hand, worry that what they admit will 
somehow be held against them in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is saying you're sorry is actually a sign of strength, Hancock says. 
When you admit you made a mistake, people will often view you with respect. 
Saying you're sorry can also strengthen a relationship and increase trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Apologies are also healing. 
</P>
<P>
 "People look for an apology; they want to know that you realize you hurt them 
and had an impact on their lives," Hancock says. "Without an apology, you 
really can't solve problems and move on. The person who was harmed will 
continue to wait for an apology." 
</P>
<P>
 When the hurt is deep, an apology doesn't automatically make everything 
better, but it's a giant step in the right direction and does enable people to 
begin the healing process. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Runner of Laguna Hills knows about the power of an apology. She 
recently received one from her ex-husband, who took their son, Brian, away from 
her when the boy was 18 months old and returned him more than 15 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although it didn't erase all those years of torment over wondering where 
Brian was, my ex-husband's apology helped me deal with what happened," she 
says. "It did my heart good to know that he was sincerely sorry, and I really 
think apologizing helped him too. It seemed to wash away some of his guilty 
feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 Runner, 43, says that if she didn't get an apology from her ex-husband, she 
would be more restless and angry about what happened. "His apology enabled me 
to forgive him for those years of being separated from my son," she says, 
noting that the forgiveness gave her a long-awaited inner peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when the hurt is of less magnitude, apologies help everyone lay bad 
feelings to rest and can teach very important lessons, as Carrol, 46, of Tustin 
found out. The self-employed graphic designer, who asked that her last name not 
be published, was working for a company several years ago when she heard from a 
secretary that another employee had been bad-mouthing her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without thinking much about what I was doing, I confronted the woman who had 
been talking about me," Carrol says. "When she denied ever having said anything 
about me, I told her that the secretary had told me what she said. As soon as I 
said it, I knew it was the wrong thing to say. The woman went running to the 
secretary to confront her." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrol apologized to the secretary as soon as she could get her alone, and she 
says learned a very valuable lesson from the experience. "That incident taught 
me to always think before I talk and never betray anyone's confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 For Clint and Donna, who married 12 years ago, the old line that "love means 
never having to say you're sorry" is wrong. The couple, who asked that their 
last names not be used, always apologize when they've done something to hurt 
the other person. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you hurt another person without intending to do it, if you don't say 
you're sorry, then what does the other person think?" asks Donna, 52. "The 
person can't read your mind and tell that you're sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 Donna and Clint, who own a small business together in Tustin, have both been 
married before and learned from their previous relationships not apologizing 
can harm a marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saying you're sorry keeps the lines of communication open," says Clint, 61.

PERSONAL HEALTH; BREAKTHROUGH IN BODY-SPECIFIC MRI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scans using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be a boon for detecting tiny 
tumors and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But they're also expensive.And traditional MRI machines require a patient to 
lie still inside a tube, which can be especially anxiety-producing for 
claustrophobic patients. 
</P>
<P>
 But new "dedicated" MRI scanners, which image specific body parts while the 
patient sits outside, promise to reduce costs and anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Artoscan, which received marketing approval late last year from the Food 
and Drug Administration, is in operation at one site, says Michael Silver of 
the Lunar Corp. in Madison, Wis., U.S. distributor of the Italian machine. But 
he expects it to start showing up in Southern California by summer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Magna-SL is still awaiting FDA approval, says Joel Stutman of Magna-Lab Inc. 
in New York. Once OKd, it will be marketed to imaging centers and doctors' 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional MRI units cost $850,000 to $2 million and must be housed in 
shielded rooms. The new units cost about $375,000 to $500,000 and don't need 
special rooms. Scans with the new units should cost a third to a half as much 
as traditional scans. KATHLEEN DOHENY

IT'S BAD NEWS FOR AMERICA'S KIDS; CHILDREN: A CARNEGIE CORP. STUDY ASSERTS THAT 
YOUNGSTERS ARE SUFFERING -- AND THAT NOT MANY PEOPLE SEEM TO CARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "A staggering number" of this country's youngest citizens are part of a "quiet 
crisis" that gets scant attention from policy-makers, the media and the public, 
the Carnegie Corp. of New York charges in a new report. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the troubling findings for many of the 12 million children under age 3 
in the United States: 
</P>
<P>
 * More than 25% are born to unmarried women. About every minute, an American 
adolescent has a baby. 
</P>
<P>
 * One-quarter of women get little or no prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
 * Infants are the fastest-growing category of children entering foster care. 
</P>
<P>
 * One in three victims of physical abuse is a baby. 
</P>
<P>
 "Starting Points: Meeting the Needs of Our Youngest Children" contends that 
"the earliest years of a child's life are society's most neglected age group" 
-- and that the seeds for many of society's future problems take deep and 
lasting root when the concerns of this age group are overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our nation's children under the age of 3 and their families are in trouble, 
and their plight worsens every day. To be sure, the children themselves are not 
quiet, they are crying out for help," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 "But these sounds rarely become sound bites. Babies seldom make the news. They 
do not commit crimes, do drugs or drop out of school." 
</P>
<P>
 The study, to be released here this morning, is the culmination of three years 
of research by a Carnegie Corp. task force that sought to examine the 
developmental requirements of young children and to recommend a strategy to 
meet those needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The life situation for many of the youngest children has deteriorated badly 
in the past 30 years," task force co-chairs Dr. Eleanor Maccoby and Dr. Julius 
B. Richmond said in a joint statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Infant mortality rates are too high, child immunizations are too low, more 
are born into poverty, more are in substandard child care while their parents 
work, more are being raised by single parents. When taken together, these and 
other risk factors can lead to educational and health problems that are much 
harder and more costly to reverse." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Maccoby is an expert on family functioning and children's social behavior from 
Stanford University. Richmond, a former surgeon general, is a professor of 
health policy at Harvard University. Other members of the task force include 
former Secretary of Education Shirley Hufstedler, former New Jersey Gov. Thomas 
Kean, former Labor Secretary Ray Marshall and Dr. Jonas Salk. 
</P>
<P>
 They are among 350 specialists in the field of early childhood development who 
will attend a three-day national conference here this week to discuss the 
report and its implications. First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will address the 
group's opening session, followed by talks by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, Secretary 
of Education Richard W. Riley, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Henry 
G. Cisneros and Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the major conclusions in the report is its assertion that "parents do 
not function in a vacuum." Along with parents, business, communities, 
educational institutions and government have a shared responsibility for the 
well-being of children, the report argues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carnegie Corp. task force found also found "no clearly defined 
institutions such as schools that serve children under age 3 and that services 
and supports are not designed in an integrated fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 Community-based services and supports for families with young children are 
among the recommendations the report makes in its call for a "systematic 
approach to combatting this 'quiet crisis' of America's children."

THE NO. 1 NUMBER: 911; CPR BUYS TIME FOR VICTIMS OF CARDIAC ARREST, BUT BY 
ITSELF MAY NOT SAVE THEM, EXPERTS SAY. DIALING FOR HELP -- QUICKLY -- CAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAMELA WARRICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Seahawks were about to kick off at the Kingdome in Seattle when a fan 
clutched his chest and fell to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 As the football tumbled through the air, a group of fans turned their backs on 
the play and rushed to the stricken man. As one rescuer began pumping his 
chest, others lined up to take over.  
</P>
<P>
 "They were standing around, saying, 'It's my turn now, it's my turn,' " 
recalls Dr. Michael Copass, medical director of paramedic service for Seattle, 
where one out of every three citizens -- including all cab drivers and Kingdome 
beer vendors -- is trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation.  
</P>
<P>
 But that wasn't what saved the fallen fan's life. It was the call someone made 
to 911. 
</P>
<P>
 According to new guidelines from the American Heart Assn. and the American Red 
Cross, if you want to save a life, the first step is to pick up the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Although chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth breathing may prevent immediate 
brain damage, medical experts now agree that CPR alone does not save the lives 
of most adults whose hearts have stopped. What they need is defibrillation -- 
the application of 8,000 volts of electricity to jump-start quivering heart 
muscle -- and for that, only an equipped ambulance or fire truck will do. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Los Angeles County, that means knowing 9-1-1 and it means dialing 
those numbers first -- even if it requires leaving the victim unattended to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless this is an infant or a child, the first thing you should do if you 
come across an unconscious person is to pick up the phone," says Dr. Samuel 
Stratton, medical director of Los Angeles County's emergency programs. "CPR 
buys time. But by itself, it is not going to save the lives of most adults who 
go down." 
</P>
<P>
 If the victim is a child, the first step should always be to clear the airway 
and start CPR, including the Heimlich maneuver of repeated abdominal thrusts. 
"Children don't stop breathing because they've had a heart attack. They stop 
breathing because they are in respiratory failure from pneumonia or trauma or 
drowning or something stuck in the throat," Stratton says.  
</P>
<P>
 But for adults who collapse, summoning professional medical help is more 
urgent than beginning CPR, say Stratton and others who helped prepare the new 
guidelines, which resulted from research that showed CPR alone was not saving 
many adult lives. 
</P>
<P>
 For a cardiac arrest victim to survive, CPR has to be started within four 
minutes and medical rescuers must jolt the heart with a defibrillator within 
eight minutes, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 When basketball star Hank Gathers collapsed in 1990 on a Loyola Marymount 
University court, two physicians rushed to his aid. But it was not until a 
trainer arrived with a defibrillator -- a disputed number of minutes later -- 
that an effort was made to shock his heart back into normal rhythm. Gathers' 
family charged that the athlete might have been saved had he been defibrillated 
sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 When CPR is combined with timely use of a defibrillator, Stratton says, the 
results can be near-miraculous. "A few years ago, a man in his 40s -- a surfer 
and a businessman in the San Pedro area -- walked out of the bank and just 
collapsed. A friend immediately started CPR in the parking lot while another 
witness rushed to call 911. By the time he got to the hospital, (his friend) 
had trouble convincing him he'd nearly died," Stratton says. "In fact, he'd 
been dead for nearly a minute." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The key to survival for cardiac arrest victims is how quickly a defibrillator 
reaches their sides. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, the survival rate is 4.9% -- about half the national 
average, but well above that for other major U.S. cities. In New York City, 
only 30 out of 2,329 of cardiac arrest victims who were resuscitated survived 
and left the hospital, researchers reported last month in the Journal of the 
American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 That study found that it took an average of 11.4 minutes for the city's 
emergency medical personnel to arrive and that the first electric shock from a 
defibrillator was administered on average in 12.4 minutes -- generally too late 
to do any good. In Los Angeles County, it generally takes eight minutes or less 
-- "a very respectable time for a huge urban system like ours," Stratton says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here in the city . . . our average response time is about 5 1/2 minutes," 
says Chief Alan Cowen of the fire department's bureau of emergency medical 
services. "But we can't help anybody until they let us know they need help, 
until they call 911." 
</P>
<P>
 And, sometimes there are personal, even cultural roadblocks to emergency care. 
"Some people are afraid of catching a disease if they help a stranger who is 
down," Stratton says. "For them, we suggest first calling 911 and then if they 
don't want to do mouth to mouth, just do the chest compressions. Or use a sock 
or a shirt between your mouth and theirs." 
</P>
<P>
 Milton Urquilla, community relations officer for the Los Angeles Fire 
Department, says some immigrants may be reluctant to call authorities for fear 
they will be questioned about whether they are in this country legally. "This 
is not something we do here. If you call us at 911 for help, we only want to 
help. We are not there looking for anything or anyone else, only to provide 
emergency care." 
</P>
<P>
 But the overriding reason many witnesses to cardiac arrests or accidents don't 
help is their fear of doing something wrong or of hurting the victim. "I can 
tell you from personal experience that fear strikes us all," says Stratton, who 
rescued his 5-year-old son from the family swimming pool.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am an emergency physician who uses CPR almost every shift, but when I had 
to use it on my own child, I couldn't remember how to begin. . . . So I just 
started pumping and blowing, pumping and blowing in no particular order at 
first and it worked. That boy is a healthy 19-year-old today. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message is, just do something ," Stratton says. "The victim is 
essentially dead as it is. Pretty much anything you do will help. It's great if 
you can learn CPR and use it. But you can still save a life. The first and best 
thing to do is call 911. And do it fast." 6 Steps to Saving a Life 
</P>
<P>
 Although CPR alone is not enough to save lives in most cardiac arrest cases, 
it can buy time until emergency medical help arrives. According to the 
"American Heart Assn. Basic Life Support Heartsaver Guide," you should take the 
following six steps. 
</P>
<P>
 Shake and shout: Shake victim and shout "Are you OK?" Call victim's name if 
you know it. If no response, call 911 or local emergency number. 
</P>
<P>
 Head tilt, chin lift: To clear victim's airway, tilt head back and lift chin 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 Two slow breaths: If victim is not breathing, blow two long (two-second) 
breaths into mouth. If chest does not rise, do Heimlich anti-choke maneuver to 
clear airway. 
</P>
<P>
 Check pulse: If there is carotid (neck) pulse but no breathing, continue 
giving mouth-to-mouth, one breath every five seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Pump chest: If no pulse, pump chest 80 to 100 compressions per minute, 
followed by two slow breaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't stop: Repeat until emergency rescue squad arrives or victim regains 
consciousness.

THE GREATEST JOB ON EARTH; FROM THE AGE OF 3, TIM TEGGE HAS BEEN FOLLOWING IN 
THE BIG FLOPPY FOOTSTEPS OF HIS FATHER, A CIRCUS PERFORMER. NOW HE CLOWNS 
AROUND WITH WIFE GIGI AS THEY TRAVEL THE WORLD IN THE ONE-RING PROF. TEGGE'S 
CIRCUS CLOWN REVUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unlike many kids growing up in this century, Tim Tegge never dreamed of 
running away from home and joining the circus. He was already there. That's the 
problem when your dad's a clown. 
</P>
<P>
 From the age of 3, Tegge, 36, has been following in his father's big, floppy 
footsteps. With his family's tiny troupe, then on his own, and most recently 
with his wife, the circus has been his life. On their honeymoon, he and Gigi 
went out clowning with a circus in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 They sometimes work 100 nights in a row, living in a van and slogging through 
devastating weather. Yet on a night off, they will travel miles to see another 
circus. In crisscrossing the nation they have amassed a 10,000-piece collection 
of circus memorabilia and lore. It resides in several Orange County storage 
units, but the Tegges dream of making it the core of a museum and research 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 "People now might just go, 'Eh, so what?' But years ago the circus coming to 
town was the big thing," Tegge said. "Even in the '30s and '40s, they would 
close down schools and let businesses out at noon so people could go to the 
circus. People saved all year long to go to it. It was a big deal . . . as big 
as Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't such a big deal when Tegge was growing up in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "While all the kids in school were out organizing their baseball games and all 
that, I was playing with my circus toys. That was pretty much a 
geek-of-the-world kind of thing at the time. They couldn't comprehend anybody 
doing that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tegge's father worked for a company that made automotive diagnostic equipment, 
but he loved to clown on the side, calling in sick when he had a conflicting 
gig at a party, picnic or store opening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally, one day when he had a booking, my mom called the office and said: 
'He's not coming in today or tomorrow. In fact, he's not coming in at all. He 
quits.' She hung up and my dad goes, 'Uh-oh, what did you do?' She said, 'You 
want to do this, you've got three years to try to make it. If it doesn't work, 
back to the office.' He never went back." 
</P>
<P>
 Tegge's maiden stint behind the big red nose came when his father put him in 
makeup and had him pedal his trike behind a clown float. By the end of that 
Fourth of July parade, the 3-year-old was bushed -- and hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 He performed whenever he could with his father, whose fledgling TNT Circus was 
a far cry from Barnum and Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy, some of those early shows were pretty bad," Tegge recalled. "(My dad 
would) have one or two professional acts and he'd do balloon animals and stuff. 
To fill time, he'd get a bunch of kids from some dance school doing baton 
twirling or something. He'd hire an organist from church and instead of having 
'Ta-dah!' you'd get 'Amen.' It was just awful." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Tegge was 14, TNT had become a real, albeit small, circus, touring 
the Midwest with about 20 members and animals. He was kept at home by his mom 
during the school months in the hope he'd have a normal childhood. Not that it 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hated school and just went along with what I had to do, waiting for summer. 
I was just crazy for that. I loved being out there. I wanted to always be in 
clown makeup."  
</P>
<P>
 His father moved the family to Orange County in 1976, and TNT continued to 
perform into its 25th year. "By 1984, (my father) was slowing down pretty bad 
and was diagnosed with cancer -- he smoked like a chimney. . . . He died in 
April, 1985," Tegge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tegge wanted to keep the family circus going, but an insurance crunch made it 
nearly impossible for small shows to get liability coverage. And animal rights 
activists were protesting the treatment of circus animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, circuses are in an upswing, Tegge said, buoyed in part by the innovative 
Cirque du Soleil, which features only human acts. Along with the huge 
three-ring circuses, 60 or so small outfits work the circuit, including the 
one-ring Prof. Tegge's Circus Clown Revue. Entertaining the new audience is a 
new generation of performer -- young artists with no tradition or bloodlines in 
the craft, such as Gigi, 24, who met Tim six years ago in the Garden Grove 
comic book store where she worked.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was always into clowns, but I never thought of them as real people," Gigi 
said. "When he told me he did a circus, I thought, 'That's a real profession?' 
Except for Ringling Bros., you don't see circuses out here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The couple dated for a year. When Tim was offered a clowning gig in the 
Midwest, Gigi insisted that he take it, with the proviso that she be his 
partner. "So that was it. The day after we got married, we headed in the car 
for Illinois, he put me in makeup, we did it, and that was our honeymoon," she 
said. The couple lives with Gigi's mother in Santa Ana between gigs. 
</P>
<P>
 Gigi is learning Western rope-spinning from an 80-year-old veteran of a Wild 
West show, and the couple is working on an illusion act involving swords. But 
that's as risky as it gets. "Thank God you're a clown," Gigi has said to Tim. 
"There's no way you would've gotten me in the air on a trapeze or in a lion's 
cage."

 The circus world is a small one. On one of their two tours in Japan, the 
Tegges traveled by bullet train and cab on their night off to see a small 
Japanese circus. "We got there just in time to see the parade of performers, 
and right in the middle were these German people that worked for my dad 20 
years ago that I hadn't seen since," Tim said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japan trips were high points in a profession that has a lot of low ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, we were up to our knees in mud for 27 days straight. Sometimes you 
can't get enough electricity, can't get hay for the animals, and your wardrobe 
gets ruined in the mud," Gigi said. "And the longer it goes on, the worse it 
makes you feel." 
</P>
<P>
 The payoff, of course, is the audience reaction. "I enjoy bringing the house 
down if I can," Gigi said. "In Japan, kids would come to the show and would 
bring presents for the clowns. That drives me nuts. That's one of the best 
things ever for me." 
</P>

 Tim loves being part of a living tradition and devotes much of his free time 
to documenting circus history. He takes detours to tiny towns to scour 
newspaper microfilm for stories on old traveling shows. And he seeks out circus 
old-timers, who share memories and often pass on treasures they could easily 
sell at high prices. The Tegge collection includes stunning stone lithographs 
dating to the turn of the century, thousands of photos and slides, and letters 
from P.T. Barnum and other luminaries.  
</P>
<P>
 "People now can't imagine a time when a circus train with 100 boxcars would 
pull into a city and unload 400 horses, 20 or 30 elephants, camels, zebras, 
lions, tigers, marching bands, 2,000 people, a tent you could barely see to the 
other end of," Tim said. 
</P>
<P>
 With most of his 36 years spent in the circus, Tim sometimes gets a special 
thrill from his research, such as the trip to a bookstore that turned up more 
than old circus books. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The shop owner) pulled out some old programs, and sandwiched in with all 
this stuff was something from the TNT Circus. As we get around the country, I 
sometimes see scrapbooks and things that I turn up in. It's weird to think I'll 
be historical someday."

CHOOSING THEIR WEAPONS; CANCER SURVIVORS TELL CIRCLE 1000 MEMBERS HOW THEY'VE 
FOUGHT THE BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Diana Golden and Susan Nessim are both young women who have survived cancer, 
but they offered two very different accounts of their battle with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden and Nessim recently spoke at the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach to 
350 members of Circle 1000, the Hoag Hospital Foundation's support group for 
the Hoag Cancer Center.  
</P>
<P>
 Circle 1000 members contribute a minimum of $100 to the foundation annually, 
and in exchange they receive an invitation to the brunch. Many members give 
much more than the minimum donation (a dozen gave more than $5,000), so actual 
proceeds from the brunch exceeded $220,000. Downhill Racer 
</P>
<P>
 Golden, 31, and Nessim, 36, were first stricken with cancer in their youths, 
and both found different but effective ways of coping with their illness and 
its aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden lost her right leg to bone cancer at age 12, yet became an 
award-winning skier. She received an Olympic gold medal in the women's disabled 
giant slalom at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary and won 19 U.S. Disabled 
National Championship gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing an emerald green dress and accompanied by Midnight Sun, her giant 
Alaskan malamute that carries her bags, Golden talked about overcoming fear -- 
using her skiing experiences as a metaphor for facing life's challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine you're getting ready to ski," she said, and before anyone knew it she 
had climbed atop a table with crutches in hand. Standing on her one leg high 
above the audience, she imitated her movements as she recalled tackling a 
particularly "vicious" downhill course. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a graceful ski ride, this is hang on for your life, baby," she 
said, twisting, turning and suddenly jumping off the table toward an imaginary 
finish line, causing many in the audience to gasp. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's laying it on the line for what you love," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago Golden underwent a bilateral mastectomy for breast cancer. She has 
given up ski racing full time but she still skis, hikes and tours as a 
motivational speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "People's understanding of cancer always needs to be broadened," she said. 
Tale of Rejection 
</P>
<P>
 Nessim was 17 when she developed a rare form of childhood cancer that attacked 
one section of her thigh. After leaving the dark and painful "kingdom of the 
ill," she found she still had another battle to wage: getting people to accept 
her. As a cancer survivor Nessim has encountered rejection, isolation and 
discrimination in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 She recalled how, as a college student, she got engaged and went to visit her 
fiance's parents on spring break. At one point her fiance's mother turned to 
her and asked, "What's it like living with a time bomb inside of you?" Her 
worst fears were confirmed at dinner when the father said, "I love my son, but 
I don't want him to be a widower." 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt part of me died at that table," Nessim said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985 she founded a support group for cancer survivors called Cancervive 
that helps people deal with the aftermath of their illness. She has written a 
book called "Cancervive: The Challenge of Life After Cancer" and is working on 
several children's books dealing with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Brunch chairwoman Arden Flamson said the speakers were chosen in part because 
of their age. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cancer can strike young people, too," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoag Hospital Foundation is the fund-raising arm of Hoag Memorial Hospital 
Presbyterian, a nonprofit community hospital in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the guests: Sandy Sewell, Circle 1000 founding chairwoman; Al Auer, 
chairman of the Hoag Hospital board; Robert Dillman, medical director of the 
Hoag Cancer Center; Patti Jamieson, executive director of the Hoag Cancer 
Center; Frances Applegate, Hyla Bertea, Sherry Cagle, Patricia Cox, Jacquelyn 
Dillman, Louise Ewing, Lillian Fluor, Betty Grazer, Jodi Greenbaum, Michael and 
Kellina Hayde, Charles and Nora Hester, Nora Jorgensen Johnson, Don and Dorothy 
Koll, Anabel Konwiser, Susan Phillips, Judy Steele, Dottie Stillwell, Judith 
Swedlund, Rita Teller, Catherine Thyen, Ginny Ueberroth and Janet Curci Walsh.

YOUR BODY / KATHLEEN DOHENY: NEW DRUGS EXPAND THE OPTIONS FOR RELIEVING MONTHLY 
CRAMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They're a monthly pain for half the women of childbearing age and an 
occasional bugaboo for the other half. Although there's no magic wand to make 
menstrual cramps disappear, their causes are now better understood. As a 
result, there are more treatment options than ever. And if one doesn't work, 
chances are another will. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Research: Menstrual cramps, described as a feeling of dull achiness or 
pressure in the lower abdomen, are associated with prostaglandins, natural 
substances made in many parts of the body. Although researchers began 
discussing prostaglandins decades ago, there is still much to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to menstrual cramps, however, prostaglandins in the endometrium 
-- the membrane lining the uterus -- are believed to be the culprit. As 
menstruation approaches, production and release of these prostaglandins 
increase. This leads to uterine contractions and the resulting pain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Sorority: "Half of women who menstruate have some menstrual pain one or 
two days a month," says Alice Kirkman, spokeswoman for the American College of 
Obstetricians and Gynecologists. For one in 10 women, the pain is so severe 
that daily activities would have to be curtailed if not for medication. 
</P>
<P>
 Cramps are likely to be most severe in teen-agers and to lessen with age. But 
not always. Women who have given birth tend to have fewer problems with cramps, 
at least temporarily. It might be due to uterine changes associated with 
childbirth, says Dr. Penny Wise Budoff, an assistant professor of 
obstetrics-gynecology (family practice) at Cornell University who has 
researched cramps. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've had few problems with cramps but suddenly develop them in your 20s, 
30s or 40s, consult a doctor, says Budoff, who also directs a Long Island 
women's health center affiliated with Northshore University Hospital. Later 
onset of cramps could be a tip-off to such abnormalities as fibroid tumors or 
endometriosis (in which uterine-like tissue is found outside the uterus, often 
in the ovaries and other pelvic areas). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The "Two Birds" Approach: Women who need contraception and have cramps often 
get a twofer by using oral contraceptives, which have been shown to reduce 
cramps in 90% of women. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other Routes to Relief: Many women reach first for aspirin, acetaminophen or 
special "menstrual relief" medicines, many of which contain acetaminophen. 
</P>
<P>
 For more painful cramps, most doctors and pharmacists now recommend a 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as Advil or Motrin. "Any 
nonsteroidal that will work for arthritis will work for cramps," says Sylvia 
Curry, director of pharmacy at Century City Hospital. Like aspirin, NSAIDs work 
by inhibiting prostaglandin production. 
</P>
<P>
 "If one (over-the-counter medicine) doesn't work, try another," Budoff 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a nonsteroidal upsets the stomach, take it with food," Curry adds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stronger Stuff: When over-the-counter drugs aren't enough, some doctors 
recommend prescription drugs. Among those frequently prescribed are Ponstel 
(mefenamic acid) and Anaprox (naproxen sodium), both NSAIDs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the Horizon: This spring, an over-the-counter version of Anaprox, called 
Aleve, will be on the market, says Linda Thomas of Syntex Corp. in Palo Alto. 
Each Aleve tablet contains 220 milligrams of naproxen sodium, the same active 
ingredients as in Anaprox. By prescription, the tablets come in 275 or 550 
milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Natural Routes: Herbal remedies for cramp relief are available at health food 
stores. Although some women swear by the formulas, Budoff recommends caution, 
noting that growing and harvesting methods may vary. "You really don't know 
what you're getting," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Regular exercise and a nutritious diet seem to minimize problems with cramps, 
she adds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Timetable: Whatever pain medication you choose, take it when the pain starts 
or a bit before you expect it, experts suggest, so you can nip it in early 
stages. 
</P>
<P>
 Cramps usually begin several hours before or just after the onset of the 
period, with the first one to two days normally the most uncomfortable.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fortune Petroleum Corp., an Agoura Hills energy concern, said four natural gas 
wells and one oil well at a Texas field in which it owns a 50% interest have 
been successfully "recompleted." 
</P>
<P>
 A recompletion is when a production company explores previously untapped areas 
of old wells. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortune spent half of the $80,000 total cost of recompleting the wells at the 
La Rosa Field in Refugio County, Tex. The company said the revenues from the 
wells would show up in its second quarter financial results.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: REMOTE IMAGING SYSTEMS EXPECTS EARNINGS DECLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 International Remote Imaging Systems, a Chatsworth maker of laboratory 
equipment, said it expects to report an earnings decline the first quarter 
ended March 31 compared to the same period last year. First quarter revenues 
are also expected to be down 20% from the same quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company blamed the slump on the Northridge earthquake and on curtailed 
sales due to severe winter weather across much of the country. The 
first-quarter projections contrast to record profits and sales reported for the 
fourth quarter and the year ended Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also said it has won clearance from the federal Food and Drug 
Administration for two new uses for its urine-testing instrument. The company 
said the FDA clearance could increase Yellow IRIS's utilization by about 20% 
and make it easier for hospitals to justify spending up to $125,000 to buy one.

POST-QUAKE 20TH CENTURY RETHINKS STRATEGY; INSURANCE: IN THE FACE OF $325 
MILLION IN EARTHQUAKE CLAIMS, ANALYSTS SAY THE COMPANY MUST EXPAND OUTSIDE OF 
LOS ANGELES TO REDUCE ITS RISK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Facing $325 million in earthquake claims and the loss of one-quarter of its 
capital and surplus, 20th Century Industries Inc. is likely to change its 
strategy on homeowners insurance and try to get more business outside of Los 
Angeles to lessen the financial risk of another big earthquake, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Although analysts expect 20th Century to keep selling homeowners insurance, 
they expect the company to speed up its expansion into Northern California and 
San Diego as a way to spread its risk over a wider geographic region. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills company, parent of 20th Century Insurance Co., declined to 
comment about its post-earthquake strategy. "Some of these issues are tough," 
Senior Vice President Rick Dinon said. "That's why we're not prepared to talk 
about them yet." 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century, best known as an auto insurer, a decade ago broadened into home 
insurance to help the company grow. But even now, its auto business generates 
more than 10 times the revenue of its homeowners policies, and yet the majority 
of those $325 million in quake damage claims are from 20th Century's homeowners 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 To try to protect itself financially against more big earthquakes, 20th 
Century said Monday that it has doubled its catastrophe reinsurance coverage to 
$200 million. Both reinsurance policies will be in effect through the end of 
June, after which the company will "carefully consider its coverage for the 
upcoming 12 months," it said in a release. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinsurance is expensive for insurance companies and often limited in its 
coverage. The earthquake reinsurance policy 20th Century had through Lloyd's of 
London for the Northridge earthquake will cover only $75 million of the $325 
million in earthquake claims 20th Century faces, and the annual premium for 
that policy was $13 million, plus a $10-million deductible. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the Northridge earthquake, analysts considered 20th Century's 
diversification into homeowners insurance a good move, because the company kept 
its costs low by selling homeowners policies directly to its auto customers and 
by concentrating in the Los Angeles area -- particularly in the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the earthquake, that advantage suddenly turned into a liability. 
Under California law, insurers must offer earthquake coverage with homeowners 
policies. In the areas hardest hit by the temblor, about 45% of 20th Century's 
policyholders had earthquake coverage -- a high proportion relative to the 
industry, said analyst John A. Hall at Northington Partners, an Avon, Conn., 
insurance industry research firm. 
</P>
<P>
 For 20th Century, the earthquake couldn't have hit in a worse place. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue of concentration has been a big strength for them," said analyst 
Vincent J. Dowling Jr. at Paulsen, Dowling Securities, an insurance industry 
research firm in Boston. "They've had critical mass and they get referrals, and 
this has allowed them to have the lowest expense ratio in the industry. There's 
a flip side to that concentration when you're exposed to earthquakes." 
</P>
<P>
 On the day after the Northridge earthquake, 20th Century Chief Executive Neil 
H. Ashley said he expected total quake damage claims to come in under $100 
million. But as policyholders kept filing claims and damage to homes was found 
to be more severe than previously thought, the company kept raising its 
projected quake claims to the current estimate of $325 million. As a result, 
the company expects a charge of about $161.7 million in the first quarter, and 
another $8.5 million charge from reinstating its reinsurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges will wipe out 26% of the company's capital and surplus, or cushion 
against claims, which totaled $655 million at the end of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century's stock has also taken a hit, losing 40% of its value since 
hitting $30.88 a share in the fourth quarter. The company's stock closed at 
$18.50 a share on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts now expect the company to suffer an operating loss for all of 1994 of 
$50 million to $80 million -- not including any profits or losses on its 
outside investments. By contrast, in 1993 20th Century had net income of $112.6 
million on $1.1 billion in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, insurance rating agencies A.M. Best and S&P CreditWire are both 
reviewing 20th Century to possibly downgrade the insurer's stellar rating of 
its ability to pay claims. Both say that even if they downgrade 20th Century, 
the company will still have a high rating. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the earthquake, 20th Century was trying to lessen its exposure to 
catastrophes in the Los Angeles area. In 1993, the company recorded an 
underwriting loss of $11.6 million on its $81 million in homeowners premiums 
earned. (It is common for insurers to lose money, or just break even, on their 
insurance business, but then make a net profit by investing the premiums paid 
by its customers.) The company's homeowners business was hurt in 1993, 20th 
Century said, by $4.6 million in claims from heavy rains early in the year, and 
additional losses from the Southern California fires last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, 20th Century last year had a $25.1-million underwriting profit 
from its auto insurance business on $908 million in premiums earned. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say that another big question for 20th Century is whether it will get 
approval to raise its insurance rates. That depends on the outcome of 20th 
Century's requests to the California Department of Insurance to raise its auto 
insurance rates by 9.2%, and to raise its homeowners insurance policies by 
21.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 Analyst Ira L. Zuckerman at SBS Financial Group, a Westport, Conn., investment 
firm, doesn't expect a decision on the rate-increase requests before the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Though analysts contend that 20th Century is due for rate increases, the 
company already has a contentious relationship with the insurance department 
and Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi over Proposition 103, the 
voter-approved 1988 initiative to roll back auto insurance rates. The company 
has become the point man in the industry's battle to avoid paying insurance 
rebates, and so far in court 20th Century has avoided having to pay any 
rebates. Garamendi had ordered 20th Century to refund $78 million in premiums, 
plus interest, but the case is currently before the California Supreme Court, 
and oral arguments in the case have not been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, 20th Century, which has been hunting for a larger headquarters 
than its site in Warner Center, said it is "seriously considering" moving to 
Warner Plaza III, a vacant Warner Center tower developed by Voit Cos. However, 
20th Century, which in January backed out of a plan to move into the proposed 
Warner Ridge development nearby, said it is still considering other options.

REUSABLE ROCKET IS PROPOSED AS POSSIBLE SHUTTLE REPLACEMENT; AEROSPACE: 
LOCKHEED AND ROCKETDYNE HAVE TEAMED UP TO COMPETE WITH OTHER AEROSPACE 
COMPANIES FOR $167 MILLION IN NASA GRANTS TO STUDY THE FEASIBILITY OF A 
'SINGLE-STAGE-TO-ORBIT' ROCKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lockheed Corp. and Rocketdyne have proposed a radical, reusable wedged-shaped 
spacecraft with rocket engines to lift it into orbit and return in one piece, 
and which could by next decade replace the current space shuttle and the 
country's fleet of expendable rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed, based in Calabasas, and Rocketdyne, the Canoga Park division of 
Rockwell International, have teamed up, and are among several aerospace 
companies competing for $167 million in grants from the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration (NASA) over the next five years to explore the 
feasibility of a so-called "single-stage-to-orbit" rocket, or SSTO. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason behind all this is to save money. Lockheed could develop the new 
single-stage rocket vehicle at a cost of about $6 billion by the end of this 
century, said Bob Baumgartner, chief engineer of Lockheed's AeroBallistic 
Rocket SSTO program in Palmdale. After that, the cost per launch would be about 
$20 million, he said. By contrast, the current space shuttle costs about $322 
million per launch, NASA official Ivan Bekey said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some consider the single-stage-to-orbit rocket to be a pie-in-the-sky 
idea. "I suppose it can be made to work. The question is at what price," 
Caltech aeronautics professor Wolfgang Knauss said. The potential pratfalls are 
numerous, Knauss said, adding that the idea of a single-stage rocket is still 
viewed as "a little far out." 
</P>
<P>
 Materials that work well in the lab might surprise once they're in space, 
Knauss said. Newer, lightweight materials proposed for SSTO rockets "have all 
this promise, but they haven't really been explored for engineering purposes," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Congress would support such a plan is far from clear. Also uncertain 
is whether the Pentagon and the White House will back the SSTO concept. Both 
are now completing separate studies on revamping U. S. rocket launch systems, 
and are expected to release their recommendations in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the idea of a single-stage reusable rocket is being taken seriously by 
NASA. The agency's own study estimates that it would cost NASA $18 billion for 
development, and $19 billion for production of a fleet of seven SSTO rockets to 
begin replacing current launching systems by around 2008. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA, though, is hoping the government will never have to pay for this new 
generation of launching vehicles. The agency wants an SSTO program to mark a 
new era of privatization of rocket systems in which American companies develop 
and own spacecraft, while NASA would simply be a customer among many. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea behind an SSTO is to reach orbit with a single-stage rocket, without 
jettisoning engines or fuel tanks. Such a vehicle would make repeated trips to 
space with a minimum of tinkering. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a radical departure from current methods. All of the country's 
existing fleet of expendable rockets drop bits of themselves in stages, 
lightening the load as they climb. 
</P>
<P>
 The current space shuttle fleet is closer to being truly reusable. The 
shuttles drop two solid fuel boosters and a fuel tank in flight. Once they are 
fished from the ocean, the boosters can be used a few more times, but 
refurbishing the shuttle for repeat flights is a mammoth project that keeps 
thousands of government workers in constant employment. 
</P>
<P>
 The current multiple-stage rockets are wasteful and costly, Baumgartner said. 
But a single-stage rocket must also overcome considerable technical hurdles. It 
must be both light enough, and powerful enough, to reach orbit intact, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed's new concept is similar to several other proposals for SSTOs. 
McDonnell Douglas has proposed a craft that would return to earth by landing 
vertically and descending slowly onto a landing pad, with its nose pointed 
skyward. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed's SSTO rocket would be more like the shuttle. It would shoot up 
vertically from the launching pad like current rockets, and descend by landing 
horizontally on a runway like an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials say it's no coincidence the design comes not from its 
missile division, but from Lockheed Advanced Development Co. in Palmdale, also 
known as the Skunk Works, the group which has produced various spy planes and 
fighter jets. "This is a radical change, a leapfrog," Baumgartner said. "We see 
it as aircraft that goes into orbit rather than a rocket that lands." 
</P>
<P>
 Rocketdyne has the contract to make engines for the current space shuttle, and 
wants to remain in the vanguard as NASA plans what could be the shuttle's 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
 If they do get funding to build an SSTO, Lockheed and Rocketdyne's engineers 
have plenty of technical hurdles to overcome because the very features that 
make a craft reusable tend to add weight: For instance, reusable rockets must 
be swaddled in heat-resistant material to avoid charring when they re-enter the 
atmosphere. And more powerful engines usually weigh more. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed, however, believes it can master these trade-offs. Its proposed 
design for an SSTO rocket craft is a wingless, 110-foot-long, 110-foot-wide, 
triangular-shaped wedge. Technology advances make such an SSTO rocket possible 
today, Baumgartner contends. The most important of these is improved materials, 
particularly light and durable graphite composites. 
</P>
<P>
 Graphite composites have been used for the bodies of military aircraft for 
years, Baumgartner said. They would be used to form the internal body and the 
hydrogen fuel tanks in Lockheed's SSTO design. A new, super-light aluminum 
would be used to build the liquid oxygen fuel tanks while heat-resistant 
ceramics and other high-temperature metals would shield the rocket from the 
heat of re-entry, Baumgartner said. 
</P>
<P>
 These materials are not only light, they are more durable than the tiles now 
used to protect the space shuttle, and they would not require time-consuming 
inspection and waterproofing after each flight, he said. The craft would carry 
a payload of about 40,000 pounds, compared with the space shuttle's 50,000 
pounds, and run on liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen fuel, Baumgartner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven engines manufactured by Rocketdyne are to be mounted in the rear of the 
craft. The engines are flatter than ordinary, bell-shaped rocket engines, and 
while they are heavy, they would in theory make up for it by conforming to the 
body's weight-saving design. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocketdyne's "linear aerospike" engine was studied initially for space shuttle 
use in the early 1970s, but was never tested because NASA instead decided to 
use more traditional bell-shaped rocket engines, said Don Fulton, program 
director of advanced launch system engines at Rocketdyne. 
</P>
<P>
 In traditional rockets, the engine nozzle is an enclosed series of tubes. In 
the linear aerospike it is just a curved plate of metal. The gases expand 
against the plate and are contained by the friction of the surrounding 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed projects the cost of launching its proposed SSTO would be about $500 
per pound of payload, as contrasted with about $7,000 per pound average for the 
current U. S. rocket fleet and for the cheapest available commercial launch 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Lockheed and Rocketdyne concede, the SSTO project hinges on a slew of 
unknowns. Much of the technology needed to make an SSTO has yet to be tested. 
For instance, it's unknown whether graphite composite fuel tanks can be 
designed to survive repeated launches without leaking, Baumgartner said. And 
the effects of the atmosphere against the body of the craft is another unknown, 
as is the performance of the engine once mounted in the rocket. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA, however, favors development of an SSTO over other cost-saving 
alternatives, such as updating current rockets, in part because it believes an 
SSTO would restore American dominance of the world market for launching 
systems. Since the mid-1970s, the American share of the private rocket market 
has slipped from 100% to about 30% of launchings worldwide, while French, 
Chinese and Russian shares have steadily grown. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics question whether the commercial market for SSTOs would justify the 
cost of developing one. "The idea is that . . . if you lower the cost of 
access, it will make people want to do things in space. I think that remains to 
be seen," said John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George 
Washington University.

HOUSING SALES JUMP WHILE PRICES DECLINE; REAL ESTATE: LAST MONTH'S SALES OF 
SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSES INCREASED 10% FROM MARCH, 1993, BUT THE AVERAGE PRICE 
DROPPED 8% FROM LAST YEAR. 
</P>

<P>
 As they have for the past 12 months, sales of existing houses and condominiums 
posted a year-to-year increase last month, rising 5% from March, 1993. But, as 
has also been the case for the past year, prices continued to fall. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 776 single-family houses and condominiums changed hands in March, 
compared with 736 units sold a year before, according to the San Fernando 
Valley Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month's sales climbed 30% from the 596 houses and condominiums that sold 
in February. 
</P>
<P>
 A jump in single-family house sales accounted for the overall gain. In March, 
house sales jumped 10% to 684 from 622 a year earlier, and surged 33% from 
February's 513 house sales. 
</P>
<P>
 But the average price of a single-family house sold last month was $240,100, 
down 8% from the $262,300 average price in March, 1993. But the average price 
of houses sold last month was 4% higher than February's average price of 
$231,600. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the median price of single-family houses sold declined 10% to 
$182,000, from $203,000 in March, 1993. A median price is the point at which 
half the houses sold for more than $182,000 and half sold for less. In 
February, the median sales price for a house was $180,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The realty association said the increased sales were triggered by an improving 
economy and a slight increase in mortgage interest rates, which caused 
potential buyers to hurry up and close deals before interest rates rose 
further. The realty group also said that properties in escrow -- which it uses 
as an indicator of future sales activity -- were at the highest level last 
month since August, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not even the Northridge earthquake and its flurry of aftershocks could stifle 
the demand for housing," said Alice McCain, president of the realty 
association. 
</P>
<P>
 However, sales of condominiums remained on shaky ground in March, plunging 19% 
from a year earlier, from 114 to 92, although it marked an 11% increase from 
the 83 units sold in February. 
</P>
<P>
 The average price of a condominium sold in March was $133,100, down 12% from a 
$151,500 average price a year earlier, but 9% above the $121,700 average price 
in February. 
</P>
<P>
 The median price of condominiums fell 13% last month, to $125,000 from 
$144,000 in March, 1993, but rose 5% from February's $119,000 median price. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 8,410 properties were actively listed for sale in March, 31% lower 
than a year ago, and 44% fewer than the record high of 14,954 active listings 
in June, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley realty group, the largest in California, has 7,800 members from 
North Hollywood to Calabasas. Its figures generally do not include sales of new 
homes. March Valley Home Sales 03,15,12,07 Avg. Price Sales NORTH WEST $236,500 
31 SOUTH WEST $286,000 230 NORTH CENTRAL $218,600 88 SOUTH CENTRAL $248,000 108 
NORTH EAST $141,300 80 SOUTH EAST $230,000 147

PROPERTY VALUES: FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY WON'T ALWAYS SAVE YOUR HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ron Galperin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Stop Foreclosures," "Protect Your Home" and "Get the Fresh Start You 
Deserve." 
</P>
<P>
 These are but a sampling of the ads for bankruptcy attorneys and paralegal 
services that have run recently in The Times, other newspapers, and on radio 
and TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Personal bankruptcy is a painful process and rarely turns out to be a way for 
people to save their homes. Filing for bankruptcy protection can buy some 
homeowners enough time to sell their homes before a lender completes 
foreclosure. And, in some cases, a bankruptcy can help homeowners keep their 
property. Most of the time, however, staying in a home after a bankruptcy turns 
out to be untenable. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners in the San Fernando Valley and Ventura County who are contemplating 
a bankruptcy filing -- especially after damage from the January earthquake -- 
should do their homework before entering bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are being misled by many of the bankruptcy ads," said Marjorie 
Erickson, assistant U. S. trustee in Los Angeles with the Justice Department's 
Office of the U. S. Trustee, which administers the bankruptcy system and serves 
as a watchdog over bankruptcy court proceedings. Bankruptcy won't necessarily 
stop foreclosure, she said. Often, it just delays the inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is no equity in the home, debtors in a Chapter 7 (liquidation) 
bankruptcy may buy themselves one or two more months in the home," Erickson 
said. If there is equity, she added, the owner may have time to sell the home 
and avoid foreclosure, or perhaps the financial situation will improve and the 
debtor can get current on the loan and start paying on time again. The latter, 
Erickson acknowledged, is relatively rare. 
</P>
<P>
 If you do file for bankruptcy, it can remain on your credit report for seven 
to 10 years. This makes getting new credit cards and other credit more 
difficult -- but not impossible. Some credit card companies offer cards to 
people who have recently filed for bankruptcy protection, and many loan brokers 
report that a would-be borrower can get a mortgage about two years after a 
bankruptcy if the borrower has two good tax returns to show a lender. 
</P>
<P>
 Filing for bankruptcy also costs money. There are lawyers or paralegal 
services charging as little as $150 for filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, plus 
some minor court costs. Expect to pay about twice this much in most cases, 
though. A simple Chapter 13 bankruptcy usually ranges from $500 to $800. More 
complicated estates will cost $1,000 and up. All fees to the lawyers are paid 
upfront, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 The U. S. Bankruptcy Code is the basis for bankruptcy law administered by 
federal bankruptcy courts and the U. S. trustee. Common to all forms of 
bankruptcy protection is the so-called automatic stay, which freezes 
enforcement proceedings, service of legal process, enforcement of liens and 
even attempts over the phone to collect debts. Some things aren't stayed, 
including criminal proceedings, alimony, child support and enforcement of a 
governmental, police or regulatory power. Also, a secured creditor can request 
what's known as relief from stay, whereby that creditor may be able to still 
reach the debtor's assets in bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapter 7 is the most frequently employed form of personal bankruptcy. Also 
known as "straight" or "liquidation bankruptcy," Chapter 7 is a way for debtors 
to wipe out most of their unsecured debts. In this process, most homeowners 
will end up having to either quickly sell their homes, or the lender will be 
allowed to proceed with a foreclosure if the homeowner has no equity left in 
the property. 
</P>
<P>
 It is very hard for most homeowners to keep their house for any length of time 
after filing for bankruptcy protection, said Kenneth B. Rodman, an attorney in 
Westlake Village. In Chapter 7 cases, a homeowner may be able to hold on if 
there is equity in the home. "But in today's market, most owners don't have any 
equity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Debtors who choose to liquidate their assets through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy 
can hold on to certain assets. This includes household furnishings, $1,200 for 
a motor vehicle for personal use, up to $2,500 in jewelry and artwork, up to 
$2,500 and a motor vehicle used for business, and disability and retirement 
benefits, plus some of the equity in a home. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapter 13 is a form of personal financial reorganization in which a debtor 
has three to five years to implement a debt repayment plan. This protection is 
available to debtors with less than $100,000 in unsecured debts and $350,000 in 
secured debts. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapter 13, most attorneys say, is the best bet for homeowners who want to 
keep their homes. But only about 15% of Chapter 13 filers are able to complete 
their debt reorganization plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Making it though Chapter 13 is a very tough road," said David R. Hagen, a 
partner in the bankruptcy law firm Merritt & Hagen in Woodland Hills. A Chapter 
13 filer also needs to keep paying his or her mortgage on time and make 
additional monthly payments to make up past debts. That's a heavy burden, Hagen 
conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagen recently worked with one client in West Hills to develop a Chapter 13 
reorganization plan aimed at helping the client keep his home. The residence is 
worth about $200,000 today, and the owner owes $189,000 on two mortgages. His 
two other assets are a small pension plan and two older cars. As part of the 
deal with the bankruptcy court and with his creditors, Hagen's client has to 
keep paying his two mortgages and an additional $700 a month for the next 36 
months to make up for a whopping $21,000 in back payments owed on one of the 
mortgages. "He thinks he can do it," Hagen said, "but it won't be easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Chapter 11 is a form of reorganization used by businesses or individuals with 
large debts. This chapter is very complex and requires extensive accounting 
records that must be submitted to a trustee. These reports generally require 
the services of an accountant. 
</P>
<P>
 A homestead declaration protects the equity in your primary residence from 
being tapped by an unsecured creditor who either wants to force the sale of 
your home or wants to collect the profits made on the sale of your home. 
Although some homestead protection is automatic under a state law passed in 
1983, many lawyers still advise that it's best to file a "Declaration of 
Homestead" with a county recorder's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Homestead protection for singles is $50,000. For the member of a family, the 
protection is $75,000. And, for homeowners who are 65 years old or older, 
disabled or low-income earners 55 years old or older, the protection totals 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners should know that a homestead declaration won't always stop the 
forced sale of a home. A homestead only protects an owner's equity up to 
certain dollar amounts, and a homestead declaration will not protect you from a 
secured creditor. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapter 13 has no exemptions of any sort because the point of this bankruptcy 
approach is that the debtor gets to keep all of his or her assets as long as 
the bills continue to be paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers who are contemplating a bankruptcy filing can save money on attorney 
fees by doing their own paperwork or perhaps hiring a paralegal service instead 
of a law firm to handle simple cases, said Robin Leonard, a Berkeley attorney 
who authored "Money Troubles: Legal Strategies to Cope With Your Debts" and 
"How to File for Bankruptcy." 
</P>
<P>
 There are a lot of forms, and people have to gather all sorts of information 
to complete a bankruptcy petition, Leonard said, "but Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 
instructions are fairly self-explanatory." 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard's books can be ordered by calling Nolo Press in Berkeley at (800) 
992-6656.

AT A CROSSROADS OVER CHINA POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ostrich mentality of American businesses is all too predictable when it 
comes to placing profits over morality in the international marketplace. In Don 
Lee's article entitled "Local Firms Say if China Loses, They Do Too" (March 
29), the question should be, "Will the American consumer be willing to pay from 
10% to 40% more for products manufactured in China, if it could mean a possible 
improvement in that country's internal police system?" 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody, not even the Chinese themselves, have denied the human rights 
dichotomy that exists between the politically correct American republic and the 
Chinese proletarian dictatorship. What is at issue is the inherent right of one 
nation's political leadership to pass moral judgment on another's internal 
legal and penal practices and, if so, does that condemnation require some form 
of retaliation on the part of the offended party? 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the People's Republic of China's first 20 years, no love was lost 
between the United States and China as both sides reciprocally engaged in 
vituperative and hostile practices highlighted by the mutually contradictory 
interpretations of the Korean conflict that best characterized that 
polarization. 
</P>
<P>
 Did this mutual animosity indirectly help kill thousands, maybe millions, of 
China's peasants during the now-discredited agrarian reforms of the 1950s and 
'60s due to the total lack of dialogue between Mao's starving China and the 
world's most charitable and giving nation? China's political leadership was 
willing to pay the price of its policies in holding out for an American 
recognition based on mutual respect for each other's internal affairs, no 
matter how mutually distasteful they may have been. 
</P>
<P>
 But surely, withdrawing China's most-favored-nation status is not tantamount 
to the total disengagement that characterized our first 20 years. Although none 
of the local firms in Mr. Lee's article indicated that withdrawing MFN status 
would put them out of business, it seems certain that their relocation would 
cause cost increases, which they surely would pass along to you and me. (They 
might want to consider moving to one of our NAFTA partners who are every bit as 
needy of American investment as China.) 
</P>
<P>
 What we need to ask ourselves is what price are we willing to pay for our 
disapproval of China's internal human rights abuses, and how effective will our 
actions be in bringing about desired changes?

PREMIERE RADIO POSTS $220,795 4TH-QUARTER LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Premiere Radio Networks Inc., a Sherman Oaks radio station owner and producer 
of radio programming, reported a $220,795 net loss for the fourth quarter. A 
year earlier, the company earned $190,174. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue in the three months that ended Dec. 31 totaled $3.27 million, a 35% 
increase from the $2.43 million in revenue one year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In all of 1993, Premiere lost $521,389, while its revenue grew 7%, to $10.8 
million. In 1992, the company had net income of $1.16 million on $10.1 million 
in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Premiere had earlier said it expected the loss in 1993 because of investments 
that it made last year, including its purchase of a radio station in Denver and 
the acquisition of Olympia Radio Networks. It also started its first nationally 
syndicated morning radio show, "Gerry House and the House Foundation."

PRESCRIPTION FOR SURVIVAL; PHYSICIANS FORM GROUPS, ALIGN WITH HMOS IN NEW 
ENVIRONMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the fast-changing health-care business, many worried physicians in the 
region are banding together and forming medical groups in the hope that being 
bigger will help them attract more patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The mergers reflect an effort by physicians to tap into the surging number of 
patients who have signed up with health-maintenance organizations, which 
contract with a select list of hospitals and doctors. HMOs typically don't 
contract with sole practitioners or physicians in small practices. So by 
combining practices, doctors believe size and geographical reach will give them 
clout to win more HMO contracts and get better rates from health insurers and 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many physicians don't want to join big groups, health-care reform is 
expected to keep pushing managed-care plans like HMOs. That will continue to 
erode the number of traditional patients who can choose any doctor, which will 
make it extremely tough for small physician practices to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart Brooks, 49, a Simi Valley pediatrician, figures he lost about 20% of 
his patients in recent years because employers pushed many of them to join 
HMOs. After 18 years of working with only one partner, Brooks last May lumped 
his practice with four small physician groups in Simi Valley and formed Family 
Health Care Medical Group Inc. That group is now a corporation with 25 salaried 
doctors, annual revenue of about $14 million and 120 employees, including a 
chief executive who negotiates contracts with HMOs and oversees the financial 
management of the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 "To practice in the 1990s, you have to be willing to adapt," said Brooks, who 
is now seeing many of his former patients because they have signed up with 
Family Health Care through an HMO. Overall, Family Health Care now has 
contracts with a dozen HMOs to see patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Since joining the medical group, Brooks is working harder, seeing more 
patients and his income is about 10% higher than a year ago. "I'm happy with 
the group," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most medical groups in the San Fernando Valley area and Ventura County are 
still relatively small, with fewer than 50 doctors each. The biggest medical 
group in the area is one related to Kaiser Permanente, the state's biggest HMO. 
Kaiser has more than 300,000 members, or patients, in the San Fernando, Santa 
Clarita and Antelope valleys, and they are seen almost exclusively by 535 
doctors through the Southern California Permanente Medical Group. 
</P>
<P>
 The other HMOs in the area do business with various medical groups, including 
several larger ones: Greater Valley Medical Group in Northridge with 30 
doctors; Community Medical Group of the West Valley with 36 doctors, and Facey 
Medical Group in the Valley with about 65 doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Size is critical because under managed care, HMOs in the area typically pay a 
medical group between $35 and $40 a month per patient no matter how often that 
patient comes in for treatment. Because no one knows exactly how many HMO 
members will make office visits, the larger the patient base, the more 
effectively a medical group can spread its risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Greater Valley Medical Group in Northridge will get bigger this month when it 
merges with Simi Hills Family Medicine Group, a five-doctor practice in Simi 
Valley. Greater Valley approached Simi Hills last fall, wanting to expand in 
that area and drawn by Simi Hills' 10,000 HMO patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Alberto Odio, a family physician with Simi Hills, said his group was doing 
fine financially but decided to join Greater Valley Medical because Simi Hills 
didn't want to be forced into a merger later with a big group it didn't like. 
Odio said that the Simi Hills group will still maintain some independence, 
including being able to refer patients to specialists without having to go 
through Greater Valley Medical's review procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger will also give Greater Valley Medical more than 55,000 patients, 
most of them HMO members. Still, the group says it needs to get bigger and so 
is considering forging other alliances. "There hasn't been anybody who hasn't 
knocked on someone else's door," said Gail DellaVedova, Greater Valley 
Medical's administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're going through right now is a lot of churning," said John Edelston, 
a health-care analyst in Woodland Hills. Edelston predicted that in a few years 
there would be just a few major medical groups, with those that provide 
high-quality care to a large number of people in the most cost-effective manner 
having the best chance of surviving. 
</P>
<P>
 John McDonald, chief executive of the huge Mullikin Medical Group based in 
Artesia, which also operates in the Valley, says a doctors' group needs to have 
at least 75,000 HMO patients to be viable. And the bigger the medical group, he 
said, the more potential for savings by combining back-office work such as 
record-keeping and billing. 
</P>
<P>
 Mullikin, with annual revenue of $340 million, entered the Valley in 1992, 
when it merged with Burbank Medical Clinic and Hawthorne Community Medical 
Group. Today, Mullikin has a half-dozen offices and 40,000 patients in the 
Valley. "We certainly hope to expand and add other members," McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
 Big medical groups such as Mullikin worry hospitals and health insurers, which 
have also been consolidating to battle in the new managed-care arena. As the 
number of medical groups shrinks while those that remain keep getting bigger, 
HMOs see themselves having less clout when it comes to dividing up the HMO 
premium dollar, which roughly is split between HMOs, hospitals and doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 CaliforniaCare, an HMO owned by Blue Cross of California and based in Woodland 
Hills, recently said it would no longer automatically accept a newly merged or 
acquired medical group into an existing contract. "These mergers have resulted 
in giving a lot of leverage to these (physician) organizations," said Ferial 
Bahremand, CaliforniaCare's director of provider services. 
</P>
<P>
 Bahremand said it's not clear if these mergers have reduced costs because of 
the extra layer of administrators that medical groups create. And in some 
cases, she said, there have been longer waits and more complaints about billing 
errors from HMO patients whose doctors belong to bigger medical groups. 
</P>
<P>
 CaliforniaCare currently contracts with about 30 medical groups in the Valley 
area and has no exclusive contracts. But health insurers are expected to seek 
leverage by contracting with a much smaller number of hospitals and medical 
groups in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, insurance companies such as Unihealth America of Burbank and some 
hospitals, including Glendale Adventist, through related foundations, have 
recently acquired medical groups to have better control of doctors' practices. 
Other HMOs are contemplating purchases of medical groups. "I wouldn't rule that 
out," said Sam Ho, medical director of Woodland Hills-based Health Net, the 
state's second-largest HMO. 
</P>
<P>
 Though tensions between HMOs and medical groups are rising, some have very 
close relationships. Community Medical Group of the West Valley was founded in 
1979 at the urging of Blue Cross of California, which wanted to enlist doctors 
to see its new Health Net patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Medical started with nine doctors who saw only 500 HMO members, or 
1% of the group's practice. "It was just an experiment in a new paying method," 
said pediatrician Marvin Kanter, one of Community Medical's founders and the 
group's chairman and chief executive. But over the years, Community Medical's 
HMO clients outgrew its conventional patients as the group signed contracts 
with FHP, CareAmerica, PacifiCare and many other health plans. Today, Community 
Medical has 36 salaried doctors in a dozen offices in the Valley. Their HMO 
patients number 43,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanter, 56, says he sees more physicians signing up with medical groups, 
especially younger doctors such as Robert Hanson, an internist who joined 
Community Medical in 1990 soon after getting out of medical school. Hanson, 36, 
works about 40 hours a week and is on call only one night a week plus every 
fifth weekend, allowing him ample time to spend with his wife and 4-year-old 
son. "It was an easy decision," Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But many doctors are wary of medical groups and managed care, and past mergers 
suggest that future combinations of physician practices will be anything but 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the five physician groups in Simi Valley could merge and form Family 
Health Care Medical Group, the 25 doctors met for four hours a week for a year 
with Jim Agronick, a health-care administrator they hired to merge the various 
groups together. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, they had to wrestle with legal matters and set up both a corporation 
and a partnership. They had to negotiate how much ownership each doctor would 
get -- in the end 20 physicians became equal owners. And they had to decide on 
salaries for each doctor, which varied depending on their group's valuation of 
a doctor's existing practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a certain amount of tension in some of the meetings," said Agronick, 
34, who had previously worked for five years as a vice president at 
CareAmerica, the Chatsworth-based HMO. "At any point, the whole thing could 
have unraveled." 
</P>
<P>
 Agronick, who is now the group's chief executive, said the medical group had a 
small loss last year and is still working out the problems of combining 
multiple record systems and staffs. But since the merger, Agronick said, the 
group has picked up 12,000 new HMO customers. Still, "we're not secure at all," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the next step for his Family Health Care Medical Group is to think 
even bigger. "Ultimately, we're going to be part of a larger network."

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: SURGE IN COMMERCIAL BUILDING EXPECTED IN COMING YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Within a year, Ventura County could well be enjoying its first upsurge of 
industrial and office building construction since the 1980s, according to two 
close observers of the county's real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
 The expected comeback promises to create hundreds of construction jobs and, 
even more importantly, to provide the factories and offices needed by an 
expanding economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The predictions are based in part on the recent relocation to the county of 
companies whose plants were damaged in the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 These moves, by units of such firms as Packard Bell Electronics and NMB 
Technology, absorbed more than 500,000 square feet of vacant industrial space. 
</P>
<P>
 But, noted Bram White, executive vice president and manager of Daum Commercial 
Real Estate Services in Camarillo, that represents less than half the 
industrial property that's been leased or rented in Ventura County since 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the interest being expressed in the county's industrial and office 
property is from firms wanting to escape such urban problems as crime, traffic 
and pollution, White noted. Such companies account for the bulk of the more 
than 1.4 million square feet of space occupied in the past five months, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, some concerns, such as GTE California and Weyerhaeuser, are 
longtime Ventura County employers who are expanding their presence in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 "Large industrial space, particularly in the east county, has become extremely 
scarce," White said. "This not only is causing upward pressure on rents, it 
also should lead to build-to-suit deals, in which developers get financing by 
signing up a building's purchaser or tenants in advance." 
</P>
<P>
 There's even talk in Ventura County's commercial real estate industry that 
speculative building may be on its way back, White added. "I've heard that at 
least two banks are considering making loans on such projects for the first 
time in three years." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Principe, senior vice president of Westcord/Westoak, a Westlake Village 
brokerage, said the same pressures -- increased demand and reduced supply -- 
are being felt in the county's office market. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next big market in Ventura County will be land for office buildings," he 
said. "I think a speculative project would definitely work today, provided a 
developer is able to secure financing." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Conejo Valley communities of Thousand Oaks, Westlake Village and 
Newbury Park, Principe added, "an office tenant looking for 25,000 square feet 
of space has only two or three choices today." Demand for retail space in the 
east county also is strengthening, he reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The market for industrial and commercial property is heating up so rapidly, in 
fact, that some developers would probably like to break ground on new projects 
within a few months, White said. "With a large project, though, it would 
practically be a miracle if you could get all your permits processed in less 
than nine months."

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: HAMBURGER HAMLET BEING SUED BY SHAREHOLDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hamburger Hamlet Restaurants Inc. in Sherman Oaks said that the company and 
some of its present and former executives and directors have been sued by a 
shareholder who alleges the defendants violated certain securities laws by 
concealing adverse information about the company and making false and 
misleading statements. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed on March 29 in U. S. District Court in Los Angeles by Mark 
Pfeifer, seeks class action status.It asks for an unspecified amount of 
compensatory and punitive damages, attorneys fees and "equitable relief to 
preserve assets," Hamburger Hamlet said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company and the other defendants deny the allegations, Hamburger Hamlet 
said in a statement, and "intend to aggressively oppose the suit." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamburger Hamlet, whose earnings have fallen because of the weak local 
economy, owns and operates 35 restaurants, most in Southern California.

KURT COBAIN, 1967-1994; IN SEATTLE, A MOOD OF TEEN DISPIRIT; LEGACY: 'THE HARD 
PART IS THAT MY FOLKS JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HE MEANT TO ME,' SAYS ONE FAN 
AT SINGER'S MEMORIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mood of broken teen spirit hangs over this citadel of '90s rock in the 
aftermath of the suicide of rock star Kurt Cobain. 
</P>
<P>
 The words most often heard as you passed through the crowd of 5,000 who 
gathered in the chill on Sunday evening for a public memorial at the Seattle 
Center were "why" and "sad." 
</P>
<P>
 Courtney Love, Cobain's widow and a rock singer herself, tried to explain the 
"why" in a message taped for the memorial. It contained excerpts from the 
suicide note found next to Cobain's body Friday at the couple's lakefront house 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't felt the excitement for so many years," Love read from the note, 
her voice trembling on the tape. "I feel guilty beyond words about these 
things. . . . When we are backstage and the lights go out and the manic roar of 
the crowd begins, it doesn't affect me. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 To many of the young people listening to his words, Cobain's lyrics of 
alienation and anguish were reflections of their own lives. They found comfort 
in songs such as "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and "All Apologies" that made them 
turn to Cobain's music with the band Nirvana the way earlier generations turned 
to John Lennon or Bob Dylan. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Cobain, who often spoke about his own difficult childhood, felt inadequate 
when people looked to him as a spokesman for his generation. He hated the 
corruption he saw in mainstream rock and worried that he might be adding to 
that corruption by assuming the role of a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is," Love continued reading Cobain's note, "I can't fool you, any of 
you. It simply isn't fair to you or to me. . . . The worst crime I can think of 
would be to (trick) people by faking it and pretending as if I were having 100% 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 He ended the note by quoting Neil Young's lyric: "It's better to burn out than 
to fade away." 
</P>
<P>
 An emotional Love followed the line with a bittersweet aside, calling that 
philosophy "a (expletive) lie." 
</P>
<P>
 Tearfully, she added a personal note. "I'm really sorry and I miss him the way 
you do. . . . I don't know what else I could have done." 
</P>
<P>
 But neither Cobain's nor Love's words of explanation eased the sadness in the 
crowd, most of which was dressed in the loose-fitting flannel shirt and pants 
identified with the city's grunge rock movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the hard part for me is that he really was the voice for most of us," 
said Rusty Reichert, 18, sitting beside six candles friends had placed on the 
ground. "He was the one who let the world know that we were here . . . that we 
were alive and how we felt." 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing the degree of disillusionment, memorial organizers invited 
representatives of the city's Crisis Clinic help group to attend the memorial 
to counsel youngsters. The first speaker on the program opened with the words, 
"We're going to get through this. It's OK." 
</P>
<P>
 "The hard part is that my folks just don't understand what he meant to me," 
said another teen-ager, who asked that his name not be used. "The night he 
died, my dad yelled at me for moping around the house. That just makes it all 
hurt all the more." 
</P>

 Indeed, the mood around Seattle was far different from similar memorials to 
earlier, more established rock heroes. At tributes in Memphis following the 
death of Elvis Presley in 1977 and in New York City after the murder of John 
Lennon in 1980, you could sense the entire cities in mourning. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd hear people of all ages talking tenderly about the singers wherever you 
went, and see messages on business marquees saying, "We miss you, John" or 
"R.I.P., Elvis." 
</P>
<P>
 Here on Sunday, however, only the young people mourned. For most of the city, 
it was business as usual on a weekend -- shopping, relaxing in the parks or 
riding bicycles in the exclusive Madrona area where Cobain lived. There were no 
messages spotted in the downtown area or along the route to Cobain's house. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the publicity about the suicide, people living as close to the 
house as three blocks didn't recognize the name Cobain when asked for 
directions to the house. The only signal of recognition was when Cobain was 
identified as the rock star who had committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, him. Three blocks down and turn to your left," a man said before resuming 
his walk. 
</P>
<P>
 The generation gap was only natural. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobain didn't live long enough for his fans to grow up and be able to look 
upon him with affection, the way Lennon's and Presley's did. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though his band sold an estimated 15 million records around the world, he 
was still, in terms of the mass pop market, an underground force. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the local newscasts underscored the point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before this weekend, you may not have known much about Kurt Cobain . . . ," 
said the Channel 4 newscaster in the star's hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans at the Seattle Center, however, spoke of Cobain with much the same 
intensity and passion as fans spoke in 1977 about Presley or in 1980 about 
Lennon. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Ballard, a disc jockey on one of the rock radio stations sponsoring the 
memorial, said that the station was flooded by calls from despondent Nirvana 
fans after news of Cobain's death was learned. He equated the reaction to "what 
it must have been like when Kennedy died." 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the public memorial, some fans turned unruly and ignored police 
instructions as they crowded into a giant fountain on the grounds of the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 While the media attention was directed at the public memorial, about 200 of 
Cobain's family and friends gathered privately a few blocks away at Unity 
Church of Seattle for their own, unannounced funeral services. (Cobain's body 
was to be cremated and Love, his mother Wendy O'Conner and Nirvana bassist 
Krist Novoselic were to decide where the ashes would be spread.) 
</P>
<P>
 At the funeral, soft chamber music was played over the sound system as 
mourners, including R.E.M.'s Peter Buck, who now lives here, took their place 
in pews, which were lined with childhood photos of Cobain. 
</P>
<P>
 Novoselic led off a series of spoken tributes. Dressed all in black, Love read 
from the Bible and then read again from the suicide note. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end, mourners listened to a tape of some of Cobain's favorite music. 
One selection offered a clue to what the man who brought comfort to a 
generation of young people turned to himself in times of need. 
</P>
<P>
 The song on the tape was John Lennon's Beatles song "In My Life," a comforting 
celebration of life that opens "There are places I'll remember all my life, 
though some have changed. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Before returning home, Love stopped by the Seattle Center with a few friends, 
but the area was largely deserted by then. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, however, some fans stood around a car listening to Nirvana music 
blaring from the tape player. The song from the "In Utero" album seemed to 
offer a final benediction to the long, draining weekend: 
</P>
<P>
 Hate, hate your enemies Save, save your friends Find, find your place Speak, 
speak the truth.

SHE'S GOT STARLET ALLURE, '40S-STYLE; ACTING: KELLY RUTHERFORD LOOKS TO OLD 
MOVIES FOR INSPIRATION. AND MANY COMPARE THE 'BRISCO COUNTY JR.' STAR TO A 
COMBINATION OF DIETRICH, BACALL AND MAE WEST. 
</P>

<P>
 Kelly Rutherford loves old movies.  
</P>
<P>
 "Every once in a while, I need to have my fix," says the 25-year-old former 
model. "I think it's mainly when I need inspiration I look at the old pictures. 
I don't find it as much in the new stuff. I love Carole Lombard. I think she's 
wonderful. Gloria Grahame was really great. Garbo. Dietrich. People knew how to 
create an illusion. Now everything is very realistic and straightforward. 
Everyone's grunge." 
</P>
<P>
 But not the blond Rutherford. In fact, there's something very retro about the 
actress. And Hollywood has picked up on that style. For two seasons, she was 
all Lauren Bacall allure as bartender Judy Owen on ABC's "Homefront." This 
season, she's a sassy combination of Marlene Dietrich and Mae West as saloon 
singer Dixie Cousins on Fox's Western-comedy "The Adventures of Brisco County 
Jr." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's definitely a cross between Marlene Dietrich and Lauren Bacall," offers 
Bruce Campbell, who plays Dixie's flame, Brisco County. "I saw a head shot of 
her that was done in the 1940s' style and she easily could have been a studio 
starlet under contract for Warner Bros. And she kind of is." 
</P>
<P>
 The series' executive producer and creator Carlton Cuse agrees with Campbell. 
" 'Homefront,' in a way, was an ideal showcase for that, because she really 
does seem like a movie star out of another era," he says. "She has that grace 
and old-fashioned kind of dignity about herself that very much reminds me of 
Bette Davis, with a certain kind of spiciness of Mae West." 
</P>
<P>
 When she landed the recurring role of Dixie, Rutherford watched numerous 
Dietrich and West flicks. "You know who I really loved was Madeline Kahn in 
'Blazing Saddles,' " says Rutherford over breakfast at the Kings Road Cafe in 
West Hollywood.  
</P>
<P>
 "She was a huge inspiration. She really helped me get this off-the-cuff thing 
which I think is part of Dixie. I think there are so few characters like that 
written now, who you can just play up. 'Homefront' was the same thing for me. 
It was set in the '40s and you can get away with being Lauren Bacall."  
</P>
<P>
 Rutherford made seven episodes of "Brisco" this season -- her last one airs 
April 22 -- while simultaneously filming the Touchstone Pictures summer release 
"I Love Trouble." This time around, Rutherford plays a contemporary woman -- a 
lab technician whom Chicago newspaper reporters Nick Nolte and Julia Roberts 
befriend to obtain information. 
</P>
<P>
 "One week I'm a modern woman seducing Nick Nolte and the next moment, I'm in 
the late 1800s seducing Bruce Campbell," sighs Rutherford, who will also appear 
in "Cyclops, Baby . . .," a short film for Buena Vista Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Rutherford says she wasn't nervous reading for her part with Nolte. "I always 
look at those things as fun," Rutherford says. "Here's an actor whom I admire, 
who is obviously one of the sexiest men alive, and the history you have going 
in reading with someone like that. My audition wasn't difficult. I was just 
reacting to him." She erupts into laughter. "It's a tough job."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rutherford, who grew up in New York and Los Angeles, left home at 17 to study 
acting in New York. "I don't know what quite got me into acting," she says. "I 
always loved movies. My mom brought me to movies as a kid." 
</P>
<P>
 To make ends meet in New York, she did commercials and modeled. "I preferred 
doing commercials," Rutherford says. "I loved modeling, but it wasn't my 
personality." 
</P>
<P>
 She got her big break doing a small scene on the ABC daytime drama "Loving," 
opposite a pre-"Beverly Hills, 90210" Luke Perry. Eventually, Rutherford left 
New York and moved back to Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 After making the rounds for a year, Rutherford got a regular gig on the 
short-lived NBC daytime drama "Generations." Guest shots on such sitcoms as 
"Teech" and "Davis Rules" followed before she landed "Homefront." 
</P>
<P>
 If "Brisco," whose ratings have been low, returns for a second season, Cuse 
would love Rutherford to be a regular on the series. Dixie, Cuse says, has 
changed dramatically since the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 "The original idea was to make Brisco more of a womanizer, where the guy has a 
different girl every episode. Maybe it was a pull of the times, in combination 
with Kelly's extraordinary talent, which led us to kind of change that. We 
decided to keep Brisco a one-woman man." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Dietrich, Garbo and Bacall are Rutherford's role models, the actress 
has discovered she's become an idol in her own right. "I get letters from 
little girls saying they want to be just like Dixie," Rutherford says, 
laughing. "They send me pictures of themselves dressing up like Dixie. I'm so 
worried what future generations will be like!"

KURT COBAIN, 1967-1994; THE LAST DAYS OF A LOST SOUL; SUICIDE: COURTNEY LOVE, 
FRIENDS HAD BEEN TRYING TO GET NIRVANA'S LEADER INTO A DRUG RECOVERY PROGRAM 
SINCE HIS MARCH OVERDOSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kurt Cobain's suicide at his house here last week was simply the final step in 
a sad and lonely death march that began weeks before in a hotel room in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite attempts by aides to publicly portray as accidental the rock singer's 
drug-induced coma March 4 in Rome, the overdose was in fact another suicide 
attempt -- complete with a note, according to sources close to the situation 
who asked not to be identified. One source said the leader of the rock group 
Nirvana swallowed 60 pills. Details of the note were not available. 
</P>
<P>
 That incident -- which left the singer in a coma for nearly 24 hours -- led 
Cobain's wife, singer Courtney Love, his band mates and others who work with 
the band into an intensive campaign to persuade the most acclaimed rock star of 
his generation into again getting treatment for drugs and depression. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cobain resisted their efforts, sources close to Cobain's family said here 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a classic case of denial," said one of the sources. "Classic and 
terribly, terribly sad." 
</P>
<P>
 In the portrait painted by the sources, Cobain -- a quiet, sensitive young man 
who was left scarred by an unhappy childhood and was uncomfortable with his 
rock stardom -- didn't take drugs in the stereotypical, party-minded "sex, 
drugs and rock 'n' roll" style. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, he took the drugs -- low-level opiates or tranquilizers, and at times 
heroin -- to block out the depression and to calm stomach pains that plagued 
him for years and were aggravated by the strain of touring. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to understand, I need relief every once in a while," a source 
quoted Cobain as saying frequently in reference to the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days of returning from Rome to the couple's home overlooking Lake 
Washington near Seattle, Cobain was reportedly turning again to heroin. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on March 18, at the couple's two-story, $1.1-million house, Cobain 
locked himself in a room, and Love told police she feared a suicide. Police 
found three pistols, a rifle and 25 boxes of ammunition.  
</P>
<P>
 Police officers said Cobain told them he had locked himself in the room after 
an argument with Love, and denied that he was suicidal. Police confiscated the 
weapons, but no arrest was made. 
</P>
<P>
 During that weekend, several people close to Cobain -- including his wife and 
bassist Krist Novoselic from Nirvana -- confronted the singer about his drug 
use in hope of persuading him of the urgency of getting professional help. 
</P>
<P>
 The intervention didn't work -- and it was this flare-up that apparently led 
to reports that the group had broken up. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is in so much denial about a drug problem that it's unbelievable," a 
friend said following the intervention attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Love went to Los Angeles on March 25 to go over final details connected 
with the release of the new album by her band, Hole, she urged Cobain to come 
with her and to check into a recovery program. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobain remained here, but Love pleaded with him daily to join her in Los 
Angeles and to seek help. 
</P>
<P>
 She warned that child welfare agencies might take away their 19-month-old 
daughter, Frances Bean, if they learned about the severity of his condition. 
The couple was threatened with such action in 1992 after Love was quoted in a 
Vanity Fair article about taking heroin while pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobain finally gave in to Love's urgings and on March 28 went to Marina del 
Rey, where he enrolled in Exodus, a recovery program affiliated with Daniel 
Freeman Memorial Hospital. It was the first sign of hope in weeks, those close 
to the couple say. 
</P>
<P>
 Love was elated. "I was so proud of him," she told a friend last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But the optimism was short-lived. Three days later, he suddenly left the 
facility without warning. 
</P>
<P>
 In a panic, Love hired private investigators to find him. The trail stretched 
to Seattle, but the investigators apparently weren't able to locate him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just really afraid for him right now," Love told a friend early last 
week, adding that Cobain suffered from "suicidal depression." 
</P>
<P>
 She told friends about a history of suicide and manic depression in his 
family. Two of his uncles committed suicide, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Cobain's disappearance stretched from four to five to six days, she became 
increasingly frightened. Reports of his behavior were sketchy, but alarming. 
</P>
<P>
 One report had him buying a shotgun and calling a friend to ask the best way 
to shoot yourself in the head. Other reports had him searching for drug dealers 
in the Seattle area. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, however, he was a shadow. He wasn't visible around town or at the 
house. A sleeping bag found at a second house the couple owns in the area led 
to speculation he might have spent a night there. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the case was solved not by the investigators but by an 
electrician who found Cobain's body when he went to do some repair work on the 
couple's house Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to widely published reports that she had left Los Angeles for London 
where Hole had a concert scheduled (but earlier canceled), Love was in Los 
Angeles when she learned about the death. 
</P>
<P>
 She left immediately for Seattle and went directly to the house, where she was 
joined by relatives, friends and fellow musicians, including Kim Deal of the 
Breeders and members of her own band. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at the home on Sunday morning that Love taped the message that was 
played to fans at the public memorial that evening -- the message that 
contained excerpts from the suicide note left by her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 The message spoke of Cobain's loss of enthusiasm for life and for music. But 
it will still be hard for Nirvana fans to understand the severity of the 
depression that pushed Cobain to take his life -- just as it is hard now for 
his family and friends to understand why all their efforts weren't enough to 
save him. 
</P>
<P>
 But the degree of Cobain's pain is evident in something he said in "Come as 
You Are: The Story of Nirvana," a recent biography of the band by Michael 
Azerrad. 
</P>
<P>
 While he said he kept the guns for protection, he called them evil things. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shot a gun with (a friend) about a year ago," he recalled. "We went down to 
Aberdeen and went out in the woods and shot this gun and it was just such a 
reminder of how brutal they are, how much damage they can do to a person." 
</P>
<P>
 To have put a shotgun to his head while having the visual picture of such 
damage suggests a pain far greater than any anger and alienation even his 
family grasped.

NIX TICKET-FEE SETTLEMENT, CONSUMER GROUP URGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK PHILIPS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A California consumer action group is urging concert-goers to reject a 
proposed settlement to a 1992 antitrust class-action lawsuit against 
Ticketmaster, claiming the pact does nothing to address the escalating cost of 
ticket service fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the settlement, Ticketmaster and Bay Area Seating Service 
Inc. (BASS) acknowledge no fault, liability or wrongdoing, but are required to 
give away an estimated $1.5 million in tickets to charitable organizations. 
Although no rebates will be issued to consumers, the law firms representing the 
plaintiffs stand to make as much as $750,000 in legal fees -- subject to court 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers opposing the agreement -- which was announced March 21 in San 
Francisco Superior Court -- must file petitions of protest before Friday to 
lawyers affiliated with the case. Individuals who serve written notice will be 
allowed to challenge the pact at a May 6 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consumers are getting burned big-time by this settlement," said Anna Alvarez 
Boyd, director of Consumer Action, a San Francisco-based group founded in 1972 
that lobbied unsuccessfully in the California Senate two years ago for 
legislation to limit ticket fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "As it stands, this settlement does nothing to lower convenience fees or to 
address the issue of competition in the ticket service market. When it comes to 
buying tickets, there's really nowhere else to take your business." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Rosen, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Ticketmaster, 
declined to comment. Ticketmaster attorney Ned Goldstein in Los Angeles 
characterized monopoly allegations against the firm as ludicrous and labeled 
efforts to derail the settlement as misguided. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that Consumer Action is being duped by individuals who have a 
separate agenda," he said. Goldstein criticized the organization for basing its 
view on "erroneous" information provided by individuals who have either been 
dismissed from the case or who are "intent on bashing" Ticketmaster for 
"political gain." 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement stems from a 1992 lawsuit alleging that the Los Angeles-based 
ticket agency and its Concord-based affiliate, BASS, conspired with prominent 
California promoters and venue operators to bilk consumers by arbitrarily 
fixing the price of ticket "convenience" fees, the service charge that adds 20% 
to 44% to the price of tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticketmaster -- which processes more than $1 billion worth of tickets each 
year to concert and sporting events in 42 states -- has dominated the ticket 
sales market since 1991 when it bought certain assets from Ticketron, thus 
putting its primary competitor out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over ticket prices and service fees has been intense for years as 
fans continue to be charged increasing prices by artist managers, promoters and 
service companies as well as by private brokers and scalpers. Ticketmaster 
phone service fees for many rock concerts now range from $6 to $8. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle rock group Pearl Jam jumped into the fray last week when it issued 
letters to promoters vowing to perform only at venues that charge no more than 
$1.80 for service or handling charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The move is seen as an attempt to combat recent actions taken by artists, 
promoters, venue operators and Ticketmaster to bury escalating service fees and 
parking costs in the price of tickets, a practice tested two weeks ago in 
Southern California when Eagles tickets went on sale for as much $115 per seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph M. Alioto, a San Francisco attorney who represented some early 
plaintiffs in the case and who opposes the settlement, is offering to represent 
plaintiffs in the original suit who want to opt out of the pact and proceed on 
their own against Ticketmaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've got a penny in your pocket right now, you've got more than you're 
going to get from this settlement," said Alioto, who has criticized 
Ticketmaster since his unsuccessful Senate run in 1992.

PUTTING THE WRONG TAGS ON GRAFFITI, RAP?; CULTURE: THEIR ROLES WILL BE 
DISCUSSED IN A PRESENTATION THAT IS PART OF A FOUR-DAY SMITHSONIAN PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN , TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Graffiti and rap music: Art or annoyance? That's the question to be probed 
Saturday in a lecture-demonstration at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1 p.m. event is part of "Many Cultures -- One Nation," a four-day series 
of talks, poetry and story readings and a dance concert addressing cultural 
diversity. It begins Thursday at the Irvine Civic Center, with ensuing events 
there and at the Bowers, courtesy of Washington's Smithsonian Institution. 
</P>
<P>
 It will feature a demonstration by Los Angeles artist Chaz Bojorquez, recorded 
rap music and a discussion by Bojorquez and Andrew Connors, a curatorial 
associate at the Smithsonian. The institution frequently organizes and tours 
such multifaceted programs around the country to bring its cultural and 
historic resources to those outside the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Connors strongly maintains that certain forms of graffiti and rap music are 
not only art, but that their appreciation is crucial to fostering understanding 
and unity in today's ethnically kaleidoscopic society. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the United States," he said in a recent phone interview from Washington, 
"often we equate good art only with pretty landscapes (by Western painters) and 
good music only with (Eurocentric) classical music. But our country doesn't 
work that way. Different people have different ways of expressing their 
message, and we need to be willing to understand those artists' backgrounds so 
we begin to appreciate their contributions to the artistic scene." 
</P>
<P>
 Bojorquez's roots are the streets of L.A.'s Highland Park, where he grew up 
practicing illegal tagging, the artist said, using a "Latino-based" style that 
favored German Gothic typeface lettering. 
</P>
<P>
 "It delineated your territory," Bojorquez explained in a phone interview, and 
contained a roll call -- or the names of members in nonviolent Latino gangs, 
the "people you hung with. It was about pride in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Bojorquez uses paintbrushes, not aerosol cans, to express himself. Some 
of his work is in the permanent collections of the Smithsonian and Laguna Art 
Museum. But he draws heavily on what he learned as a youth (the graphic skills 
and cultural mores), and his art is an investigation of forms of "calligraphy 
and how markings identify people." 
</P>
<P>
 One Smithsonian-owned piece, which fills a large canvas with Bojorquez's 
signature graffiti-like lettering and dark tones, is titled "Placa/Rollcall" 
(1980). It spells out the names of friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we assume that the city is a body," he said, "graffiti tells us where it 
hurts, and the thing is not to cut out the bad part, but to make the body 
healthy through dialogue and art. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can find out from the dialogue of graffiti that there's abandonment of 
the youth, a youth rebellion is going on that's expressed in their violence and 
how they're trying to identify themselves. I'm a bridge between that graffiti 
and the galleries. In my work, I try to clarify those problems, and show how 
that graffiti can be beautiful and be strong and can identify who we are." 
</P>
<P>
 On the art versus annoyance question, Connors is quick to stress that he is 
not condoning illegal graffiti but wants to show how artists such as Bojorquez 
are able to take such modes of expression and use them positively. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of saying, 'You're a failure unless you paint like Leonardo da 
Vinci,' " Connors said, "we're trying to say we don't feel the only way people 
can succeed is to step out of their background and deny their culture, even if 
someone's culture is something that seems as antisocial as gangs. It's never 
effective to pretend to be something you're not." 
</P>
<P>
 Connors argues that many rap musicians have likewise parlayed skills they've 
learned informally into legitimate artistic expression and that they send 
positive messages with their songs, "instead of going in the direction of 
gangsta rap," or writing lyrics full of misogyny or racism. 
</P>
<P>
 Kid Frost, also of Los Angeles, is one such rapper, Connors said, citing 
Frost's song "Ain't No Sunshine." 
</P>

WEEKEND BOX OFFICE; A GOOD TURNOUT FOR 'FOUR WEDDINGS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The witty British comedy "Four Weddings and a Funeral," from "Enchanted April" 
director Mike Newell, is making its mark on the box office in a period that is 
slow going for most movie ticket sales. Totals for the weekend were among the 
lowest of the year and are off 10% from the comparable weekend last year. But 
"Four Weddings," starring Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell, has the highest 
per-screen average of any film on the Top 10 Chart. Distributor Gramercy 
Pictures said the success warrants an increase from 552 screens to 750 this 
weekend, and will probably climb to 1,000 the following week. That would mean 
one of the biggest releases for the relatively new small distributor, which is 
a joint venture company of Universal Pictures and Polygram. 
</P>
<P>
 The new TriStar Pictures release of "Threesome," about a love triangle among 
college roommates, opened to so-so business, while the two sports sequels, "D2 
The Mighty Ducks" and "Major League II," battled for the top spot. At this 
point, ice hockey seems to be beating baseball. But the season is still young.

O.C. BOILER ROOMS SHUT DOWN IN RAIDS BY STATE; FRAUD: ACTION TARGETS SOUTHLAND 
OPERATIONS PITCHING ALLEGEDLY ILLEGAL WIRELESS CABLE TELEVISION VENTURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 State authorities, trying to stem a fast-growing area of investment fraud, 
said Monday that they raided and shut down several telephone boiler-room 
operations in Orange, Los Angeles and San Diego counties selling allegedly 
illegal investments in wireless cable television ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 The raids were aimed primarily at Marrco Communications Inc. in Newport Beach, 
which now does business as Micro-Lite Television, and the offices of San Diego 
lawyer Richard A. Weintraub. 
</P>
<P>
 Those two operations, believed to be working separately, took as much as $30 
million from more than 3,000 investors since August, 1992, said state 
Corporations Commissioner Gary S. Mendoza, whose agency conducted the raids in 
conjunction with officials of four other states. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the investors, Mendoza said, were elderly people and others not 
sufficiently sophisticated to put their money in such risky ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement issued from its Newport Beach headquarters, however, 
Micro-Lite's chairman, Jon E. Marple, insisted that his company is legitimate 
and predicted it will be "exonerated of any wrongdoing whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
 Marple, a principal of two other firms targeted by the state agency, called 
the raids "heavy-handed" and labeled his firm "a leader in the wireless cable 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
 The selling of interests in wireless cable ventures around the country has 
become fertile ground for fraud in recent years, industry observers say. In 
November, Robert L. Schmidt, president of the Wireless Cable Assn., the 
industry trade group, called the scams "nefarious" and a "cancer on the 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
 The field has attracted unscrupulous promoters in part because it is is 
relatively easy to enter and largely unregulated. Wireless cable differs from 
conventional cable television in that subscribers receive TV signals via an 
antenna-like device installed at their homes, rather than through physical 
cables. 
</P>
<P>
 Wireless cable has also become a fraud-ridden area because unscrupulous 
promoters have largely exhausted the possibilities of other types of 
investments. Furthermore, Southern California is traditionally known as the 
telemarketing fraud capital of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Orange and San Diego cases, promoters promised financial returns of 
more than 600% over five years at low risk, Mendoza said, an implausible return 
given that they were taking sales commissions of 38% to 50% of the money 
invested. 
</P>
<P>
 They also used television "infomercials," cold-calling of prospective 
investors and other high-pressure sales techniques to entice people to invest, 
he said. Mendoza cautioned that a full determination of the legitimacy of the 
ventures -- and any possible criminal charges -- would have to await further 
examination of the materials seized from their offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been active in the overall development and success of this dynamic 
new technological advance," the Marple statement said, adding that Micro-Lite 
has been the general partner of two wireless ventures in Boston and Baton 
Rouge, La., which were later sold to third parties.  
</P>
<P>
 As it happens, Micro-Lite on Monday became a publicly traded company on the 
over-the-counter market, said spokesman Mario (Ike) Iacoviello. He said the 
company had acquired a shell corporation in a deal that allowed it to go public 
without an initial stock offering. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were funding through investors, but we have discontinued that operation," 
he said. "We're a clean company doing a clean business, as far as I know. We're 
a legitimate telecommunications company." 
</P>
<P>
 Marple was otherwise unavailable for comment Monday, as was Weintraub, the San 
Diego lawyer. Agency officials said that a firm associated with Weintraub 
received a "desist and refrain" order last June to cease selling virtually 
identical investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The raids were conducted by officials of the corporations department and 
regulatory bodies from Arizona, Kansas, Missouri and Illinois at 10 Orange and 
San Diego locations associated with Marple's Marrco Communications of Newport 
Beach and with Weintraub.  
</P>
<P>
 Authorities raided Marple's Newport Beach offices and two separate offices of 
a wholly owned subsidiary, MCC Ventures Group in Irvine. They also raided 
Weintraub's law office and two other San Diego offices, as well as two Orange 
County firms associated with Weintraub: Emerging Technologies Group Inc. in 
Irvine and Microtech Communications Inc. in Costa Mesa. The remaining raids 
were on firms in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills that were connected to 
Weintraub. 
</P>
<P>
 Marple and Weintraub were not charged with a crime, though two telephone 
salespeople at Emerging Technologies were arrested and charged with a 
misdemeanor count of making telephone sales without having been registered with 
the state. They were identified by a Corporations Department spokeswoman as 
Charles A. Murphy and Collin J. Procton. They could not be reached for comment 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza said his agency believes that the raided enterprises may have been 
violating state law by selling unlicensed securities -- the cable system 
interests -- and may also have misrepresented the nature of the investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The disposition of much of the $30 million is unknown, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Iacoviello said that Marple has a "strong background" in communications and 
once worked for the Federal Communications Commission. "We're real 
telecommunications people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Micro-Lite sold its interest in a Boston wireless license to CAI Wireless 
Systems last fall for an undisclosed amount of CAI stock, he said. The company 
also owned a license for a wireless operation in Baton Rouge, La., but sold 
that a year ago. Weintraub eventually ended up with the license, said a 
corporations department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Micro-Lite, Iacoviello said, now is "building up" Des Moines, Iowa, Erie, Pa., 
Colubbia, Ky., Augusta, Me., and Logan, Utah. But he acknowledged that the 
furthest the company has got in actually delivering wireless television signals 
is to "have equipment on order" for Des Moines. No subscriptions have been sold 
to anyone yet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The main advantage of wireless cable television is that it can serve customers 
unable or unwilling to hook up via cable. For the system operator, the 
technology has the virtue of being exempt from regulation by local 
municipalities, unlike cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire industry is an outgrowth of 1983 and 1985 decisions by the Federal 
Communications Commission to reallocate for commercial use 11 television 
channels previously reserved for video conferencing and educational television. 
The FCC distributed licenses for these and other reallocated channels on a 
first-come-first-served basis, meaning that the applicants needed to put up no 
money or show any qualifications to use them. 
</P>
<P>
 Once up and running, wireless cable systems can be legitimate competitors of 
conventional cable systems. Experts say, however, that wireless cable operators 
face the obstacle of accumulating rights to enough channels in any given 
locality to compete effectively.  
</P>
<P>
 "You can tell a lot about the legitimacy of a wireless venture by how many 
channels it has," said Paul Sinderbrand, legislative counsel to the Wireless 
Cable Assn.  
</P>
<P>
 "In any market a wireless operator has to accumulate more than 20 channels" to 
be competitive, he said, noting that the licenses have to be bought from the 
holders or leased. "A lot of the bucket shops don't have 20 channels; they may 
have four, and you can't make a cable service out of four channnels of 
television." 
</P>
<P>
 This complexity also makes it hard to assign a value to any given wireless 
venture, meaning that unscrupulous promoters can freely overstate their 
systems' financial potential.

JAPAN COALITION PULLS BACK FROM BRINK OF COLLAPSE; POLITICS: CONSERVATIVE 
LEADERS BOYCOTT TALKS TO PICK A SUCCESSOR TO HOSOKAWA. BUT THEY AGREE TO TRY 
AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan's ruling coalition inched back from the brink of collapse today as both 
of its warring camps indicated they will try again to select a candidate for 
prime minister from within their ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 But hostilities remained high between the forces led by Japan Renewal Party 
official Ichiro Ozawa and those of New Party Harbinger leader Masayoshi 
Takemura. In the clearest sign yet of a break between the two camps, 
conservative coalition leaders had boycotted a meeting Monday and another today 
with their more liberal partners on selecting a successor to Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa stunned Japan's political world last week by abruptly announcing his 
resignation amid mounting questions over questionable stock deals, loans and 
his personal finances. 
</P>
<P>
 The lines between the two camps were sharply drawn when Takemura called a 
meeting of party heads to discuss Hosokawa's successor and three of the 
coalition members -- the Renewal Party, the Buddhist-backed Clean Government 
Party and Hosokawa's Japan New Party -- refused to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 The three groups said the appropriate forum to discuss the issue is a meeting 
not of party heads but of secretaries general, which would include Ozawa. They 
said they suspected that Takemura called the meeting of party heads 
deliberately to exclude his rival Ozawa. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the Japanese media pronounced the boycott the de facto end of the 
coalition, an eclectic group spanning the political spectrum. Last July, its 
members cobbled together a ruling majority to end 38 years of iron rule by the 
Liberal Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the liberal side had warned that the coalition would shatter if the 
conservatives boycotted the meeting again today, Takemura, in a change of 
tactics, called on the two sides to make a fresh start. Yuichi Ichikawa, leader 
of the Clean Government Party, immediately accepted the olive branch and vowed 
to try to repair the split. 
</P>
<P>
 As chaos mounted and the power vacuum deepened, operatives in each party 
maneuvered to try to fashion a majority, meeting secretly with former political 
enemies and reaching across party lines. A majority of the lower house of 
Parliament is necessary to elect a prime minister in the case of two 
candidates; a runoff is held between the top two vote-getters in the case of 
more than two. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many observers had initially focused on Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata 
as Hosokawa's successor, former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe assumed center 
stage Monday. He gave his strongest indication yet that he and his followers 
are ready to bolt the Liberal Democratic Party and join the Ozawa side in 
exchange for the prime minister's post. Asked Monday about his will to do so, 
Watanabe declared, "I have the will, the spirit and the physical strength." 
</P>
<P>
 Watanabe began collecting signatures from party members to support his 
candidacy. But it looked increasingly unlikely today that Watanabe, a blunt and 
witty politician whose political gaffes are legendary (he once said black 
Americans blithely declare bankruptcy to skip out on debts), could persuade 
enough followers to leave the party. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, some members of the Clean Government Party and the Renewal Party 
were reported having second thoughts about splitting the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, LDP President Yohei Kono -- a relatively young and 
fresh-faced politician elevated for his reformist image -- announced today that 
he will run for prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Should Watanabe decide not to bolt the LDP, another scenario being discussed 
is an alliance of longtime political opponents -- the Socialists and the LDP, 
along with the New Party Harbinger. 
</P>
<P>
 Although such a scenario may seem improbable on its face, there are few real 
policy differences between conservative Socialists and liberal LDP members, 
said political commentator Yoshimi Ishikawa. He noted that in recent months, 
the Socialists have changed policies on opening Japan's rice market, accepted 
the necessity of nuclear power and recognized South Korea rather than only its 
Communist neighbor to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 But the single largest factor driving the different alliances, he said, is 
Ichiro Ozawa. "Eight months ago, it was LDP versus anti-LDP," he said. "From 
today, it is Ozawa versus anti-Ozawa." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Takemura's New Party Harbinger issued a new policy platform Monday 
that further sharpens its differences with Ozawa and calls for reshaping the 
political landscape from scratch. In the most conspicuous slap at Ozawa's 
ideas, the platform calls for respecting Japan's war-renouncing constitution 
and rejecting a role for Japan as a major political or military power. It urges 
a more democratic, open policy-making process -- an indirect criticism of 
Ozawa's penchant for wielding power behind the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 But New Party Harbinger official Yukio Hatoyama said the platform is not 
necessarily an anti-Ozawa treatise.

U.S. HOPEFUL AIR STRIKES WILL SPUR NEW PEACE TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER and CAREY GOLDBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials were hopeful Monday that the combination of 
air strikes near Gorazde and a Russian diplomatic mission to the Serbian 
capital would provide the stick and carrot needed to get Bosnian Serbs to 
resume negotiating an end to the bloody civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 But they acknowledged the danger that their efforts could backfire, causing 
the Bosnian Serbs to try to grab more territory or leading the Bosnian 
government to wrongly believe that North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
involvement provides cover to try to recapture territory lost to Serbs earlier 
in the war. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ugly," one senior White House official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that risk, Clinton aides said that American officials think they had 
no choice but to carry out the air strikes, given that NATO has promised to 
offer protection to U.N. forces and there is now a U.N. commander on the scene, 
Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, in whom Washington has confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials issued clear warnings to the Serbs that further attacks could be 
launched if Serbian aggression continues to endanger U.N. peacekeepers in 
Gorazde or in other Bosnian "safe havens." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry, in a televised interview, said the Bosnian 
Serbs should not misread the limited nature of the NATO attack as a signal that 
future air strikes would also involve just a few craft. Speaking on the 
"MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour," Perry said, "NATO has well over 100 planes in this 
air fleet, so we have a formidable air armada there. 
</P>
<P>
 "So it would be a very big miscalculation for the Serbs to believe that this 
was a force which was limited to conducting an occasional close air support 
mission," he said. "We can conduct much more than that if necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's carrot-and-stick strategy depends on a successful effort 
by Russian envoy Vitaly S. Churkin, who has been meeting with Serbian leaders 
in Belgrade. Despite that, the Administration did not inform Moscow before 
launching the air strikes, leading to complaints from the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the complaints, President Clinton told reporters, "When these 
things occur, there's often not a lot of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to work very closely with the Russians," he insisted. "They 
have a critical role to play if we are going to get these peace talks going 
again, and I hope we can." 
</P>
<P>
 American officials took pains to insist the air strikes had taken place 
pursuant to U.N. procedures to which Russia had agreed -- procedures designed 
to protect the lives of U.N. peacekeepers in Bosnia -- and were executed under 
tight deadlines that prevented full consultation with other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The NATO response to a U.N. request for air support in Gorazde operated under 
"very great time urgency," Secretary of State Warren Christopher said at a news 
conference. "This system is set up so that NATO can respond promptly. Lives are 
at risk." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin, who spoke with Clinton on 
Sunday, offered a tepid response to the NATO air strikes. En route to Spain for 
an official visit, Yeltsin said, "I insisted and continue to insist that 
questions like air strikes on Serbian positions must not be decided without 
preliminary consultation between the United States and Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 But Yeltsin stopped short of condemning the NATO attack on Serbian artillery 
despite mounting pressure from Russian nationalists, including ultranationalist 
leader Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, who see the Serbs as ethnic and religious 
brethren. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian Foreign Ministry officials were more critical of the NATO action. "A 
couple more strikes like this and we can kiss the peace process goodby," an 
anonymous Russian diplomat told the Interfax news agency. In Madrid, Foreign 
Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev warned that "air strikes could bring not an end to 
war but its escalation." 
</P>
<P>
 But aside from those remarks, the Foreign Ministry issued an official 
statement that set out a policy toward Gorazde that was almost identical to 
that put forth by Clinton and Christopher, including deployment of more U.N. 
peacekeepers in and around Gorazde and a withdrawal of Serbian forces from 
territory captured in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
 "A contingent of U.N. forces should be deployed, Serbian units should be 
withdrawn from their present positions, and this secure region should be 
demilitarized, including the disarmament of Muslim units operating there," the 
ministry said in its statement. 
</P>
<P>
 At the State Department, Christopher said much the same thing, urging the 
Serbs to cease hostilities and withdraw to "their positions of March 30, the 
date on which this latest offensive against Gorazde began." 
</P>
<P>
 For the last two months, Moscow and Washington have pursued a loosely 
coordinated effort in which Churkin tries persuasion with Serbian leaders -- 
both in Bosnia and the neighboring republic of Serbia -- while NATO provides 
the threat of force. Officials here believe that approach is their best hope 
for restarting peace talks, which they thought were close to reaching an 
agreement last weekend before the Serbian offensive in Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 At least some officials believe the offensive was staged precisely as a 
sabotage attempt by Bosnian Serb factions opposed to the talks. Asked about 
that, Christopher said he would "hope that they get in good communication" with 
the Serbian leadership in Belgrade "and they understand the determination of 
the United Nations and NATO in this situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the NATO action received largely favorable responses on Capitol 
Hill, indicating that Clinton will have a relatively free hand politically, at 
least so long as no American lives are lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), second-ranking Democrat on the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee and a longtime advocate of a more forceful American 
policy toward Bosnia, called the air strikes "fully justified" and said the 
"successful demonstration of force . . . should lay to rest the tired arguments 
that 'air power alone' is ineffective in the Bosnian crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 His comments were echoed by senior lawmakers in both parties, including Senate 
Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.).

COLUMN ONE; HONG KONG'S NEW BUSINESS DYNASTIES; THE GREAT BRITISH TRADING 
HOUSES RUSH TO HIRE MORE CHINESE EXECUTIVES, SHED THEIR COLONIAL VENEER BEFORE 
BEIJING TAKES OVER IN '97.

 The ceremonial changing of the guard took place high above Hong Kong Harbor, 
in one of the glass-enclosed aeries reserved for the colony's business elite. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon Murray, a feisty Scotsman in the long tradition of British colonial 
traders here, reluctantly handed over his job last fall as managing director of 
Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., the venerable British merchant trading house, to 
Canning Fok, a low-profile Chinese accountant from Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 The switch on the 22nd floor of Hutchison House ended a boardroom debate about 
the company's direction and signaled a scramble among Hutchison and powerful 
companies like it to shed their British veneer before China takes over in three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1979, Hutchison, founded by a colonial class that once banned Chinese 
from its country clubs, had been controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Li 
Ka-shing. Li, known for his solid business ties with the Communist leadership 
in Beijing, wanted Hutchison to concentrate on its trade with mainland China. 
Murray, although bullish on China, pushed to maintain the company's business 
connections with the West through investments in Britain and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray also presented another problem: He supported the democratic reforms 
proposed for Hong Kong by British colonial Gov. Chris Patten, the bane of the 
Beijing regime. 
</P>
<P>
 When the dust settled, Murray was out. For the first time in its history, 
Hutchison was to be managed by a Chinese executive. Unequivocally, the main 
business of Hutchison would be China. There would be no more question of 
supporting Patten's reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of Hong Kong history, it was a moment almost as significant as the 
day more than 150 years earlier when Capt. Charles Elliot of the Royal Navy 
convinced the British Empire that the rocky island might be a good place to set 
up business. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Hong Kong newspapers noted with varying degrees of celebration and 
alarm, usually depending on the language in which the article was written, 
Simon Murray was one of the last British "taipans." 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a century, the Hong Kong financial world has been dominated by a 
handful of British trading houses. These are the "hongs" made famous in recent 
years through the best-selling James Clavell novels "Taipan" and "Noble House." 
</P>
<P>
 But with Hong Kong set to revert to mainland China in 1997, the days of the 
British taipan and the colonial-style hong are coming to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time the business of the hongs -- the name comes from yang hong, 
meaning "foreign company" -- was tea and opium. Today it is telecommunications 
and fleets of jetliners. One of the hongs manages the Coca-Cola franchises on 
the mainland. Another is planning a huge new container port on China's Yangtze 
River that it claims will create a Chicago-style hub on the Communist mainland. 
Another operates a chain of luxury hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the four largest hongs -- Jardine Matheson, the Swire Group, 
Hutchison Whampoa and Wheelock-Marden -- have assets of more than $17.5 
billion. All are busy buying and selling real estate on both sides of the 
Bamboo Curtain. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, the boardrooms and executive offices of the biggest hongs were 
the exclusive domain of the British taipans who commanded enormous power and 
staggering wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 The world of the taipan was one of turbaned Sikh doormen, chauffeur-driven 
Bentleys and luxurious, mahogany-paneled cabins on company-owned cargo ships 
plying the South China Sea. As an unquestioned right befitting his position, 
the taipan enjoyed the best boxes at the Happy Valley racecourse and the best 
tables at the once whites-only Hong Kong Club, described by a government 
officer in the mid-19th Century as "the paradise of the select and temple of 
colonial gentility." 
</P>
<P>
 Making the hongs, the very symbol of Victorian colonial expansionism, 
acceptable to the Communist landlords of this jewel in the South China Sea is 
one of the most compelling business stories of this decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have someone who is your boss today and someone who is going to be 
your boss tomorrow and they tell you to do two different things, which one do 
you obey?" Clive Weedon, head of research at the Nomura Research Institute of 
Hong Kong, asked rhetorically in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the question that looms over all of Hong Kong, from the political 
corridors of the Legislative Council to the locker rooms of the Hong Kong 
Police Department, as the 1997 deadline approaches. The name of the game is 
positioning, with companies and institutions scrambling for strategic redoubts 
to prepare for the changeover. 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time that the Murray-Fok switch was taking place at Hutchison, 
for example, the Swire Group announced the promotion of two Hong Kong Chinese 
executives to top positions at its Cathay Pacific Airways and Dragonair 
subsidiaries, replacing two British executives. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the new management's first acts was ordering British flags removed from 
the tails of Cathay Pacific airliners. 
</P>
<P>
 Other hongs, such as the die-hard Jardine Matheson, are busy severing their 
ties with the colony. Jardine, once the most powerful of the "princely hongs" 
and widely considered to have been the model for Clavell's "Noble House," took 
another important step in its decade-long retreat from Hong Kong last month 
when it withdrew its stock from trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Jardine had moved its corporate registration from Hong Kong to Bermuda in 
1984, after the British government and Chinese Communists agreed on the 1997 
takeover. After the Bermuda switch, the company then began shifting many of its 
investments to Singapore and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Jardine's upper management remains resolutely and unapologetically 
British. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the other hongs, Jardine made little attempt to make peace with the 
Chinese government. Its British executives, for example, were alone among hong 
officials in condemning the violent government crackdown on the 1989 democracy 
movement demonstrators in Tian An Men Square. They strongly support democratic 
reform proposals pushed by the British government in its waning days as the 
political sovereign here. 
</P>
<P>
 Jardine's pullout from the stock exchange was a chilling reminder that the old 
ways of doing business in Hong Kong are over. The announcement drew the instant 
wrath of the Chinese government. Zheng Guoxiong, deputy director of China's 
official New China News Agency in Hong Kong, described the Jardine action as 
"very irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Without saying so directly, the Chinese official accused Jardine, which 
amassed a fortune under British rule, of jumping ship as the takeover 
approached. 
</P>
<P>
 "Between now and 1997 and beyond," Zheng said, "it will take our concerted 
efforts to maintain Hong Kong's status as an international financial center. We 
don't want to see companies failing to take into account Hong Kong economic 
development and Hong Kong people's interests by taking irresponsible action." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the South China Morning Post newspaper in Hong Kong reported late 
last month, Jardine executives were secretly worried that the mainland Chinese 
antipathy toward their company would result in a stock buyout attempt by 
Chinese-backed companies on the Hong Kong exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for Jardine, the other hongs have all tried to make peace with their 
new masters by converting their British businesses to Chinese standards. Many 
argue that this is long overdue. After all, 98% of the population here is 
ethnic Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time the hongs were announcing their historic changes, Patten, 
probably the last colonial governor, named for the first time a Chinese civil 
servant, Anson Chan, as chief secretary, the highest bureaucratic post in the 
Hong Kong government. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon Murray was philosophical about the changes in an interview with Newsweek 
just after he was removed from the leadership of Hutchison. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hong Kong is moving rapidly toward China," he said, "and you've got to have 
Chinese guys on the block if you want to play that game." 
</P>
<P>
 John Hung, the portly, chain-smoking executive director of Wheelock, is a 
child of the old British hongs who is supervising the conversion of one of them 
into a Chinese institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Hung's great-uncle and his father were both "compradors," the Portuguese term 
adapted by the hongs to describe the senior Chinese officials who acted as 
middlemen between the British colonialists and their Chinese staffs and 
business contacts. The two essential positions in the hong were the taipan, or 
boss, and the comprador. 
</P>
<P>
 "These compradors -- and I know firsthand -- were in fact chief procurement 
officer of personnel," Hung recalled in an interview at Wheelock House in 
central Hong Kong. "They paid them direct. They got a big sum of money from the 
company, and they paid these fellas. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were the guarantors of the receivables, they were the underwriters 
against loss claims -- they didn't have insurance companies. They were the 
chief interpreters. They were the chief marketing and sales people. They did 
everything. They were the conduit between East and West. And without them, 
there would have been no success." 
</P>
<P>
 To Mao Tse-tung and other Communist revolutionaries, the compradors were the 
personification of imperial evil, fellow Chinese willing to sell out their race 
to the hated foreign powers. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the hongs, the comprador class began to disappear in the 1970s as the 
conversion to Chinese ownership began. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, surprisingly, Hung and Wheelock Chairman Peter Woo have revived the 
term to describe their own company -- now a "Chinese hong" -- and the role it 
will play when the People's Republic of China assumes control of Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 Hung continued: "We look at ourselves at Wheelock as an entrepreneurial 
merchant house acting as a comprador with China. There are thousands, hundreds 
of great Western companies with tremendous products that would die to get into 
China. But they don't know how. Even if they did know how, it would take them 
10 years. The perfect situation is for them to join hands with a company that 
understands East and West." 
</P>
<P>
 As Jardine withdraws from its Hong Kong base, Wheelock and Hutchison are 
considered the two "Chinese hongs." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the taipans, they are seen as useless appendages in an Asia for Asians. 
"The British families may well want to see China succeed," said one business 
analyst here, a former journalist with 25 years' experience working in Hong 
Kong, "but they probably don't have a lot of confidence that China wants to see 
them succeed. History is not really on their side." 
</P>
<P>
 With Jardine in retreat, the last of the British-owned hongs with a 
significant stake still in Hong Kong is likely to be the London-based Swire 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Jardine, Swire is naming Chinese executives for many senior positions 
while entering into ventures with powerful Communist state enterprises on the 
mainland. 
</P>
<P>
 Linus Cheung, 46, a Hong Kong Chinese named to head the commercial division of 
Swire-owned Cathay Pacific Airways, dismissed in an interview the significance 
of the rush to appoint Chinese to senior positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "But for sure, with 1997 and with the changes that are occurring," Cheung 
said, "I think Chinese who have the right experience and competence would have 
improved career opportunities compared to before. . . . It is this East meeting 
the West." 
</P>
<P>
 Clive Weedon, the Nomura Research Institute head, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time," he recalled without any nostalgia, "when it was probably 
very important to have a white face and to speak the Queen's English to get on 
in Hong Kong. Those days have now departed, and it has become increasingly 
important that one is able to speak Cantonese and Mandarin (dialects of 
Chinese) if one wants to function at a senior level in this town."

INTENSE ATTACK BY SERBS TRIGGERS 2ND NATO RAID; BOSNIA: ASSAULT ON ENCLAVE OF 
GORAZDE CONTINUES AFTER BOMBING RUN, THEN STOPS. REBELS BLOCK U.N. TROOPS IN 
SARAJEVO AND BREAK OFF CONTACTS WITH MEDIATORS. 
</P>

<P>
 Serbian rebels, angered by a NATO air attack, provoked a second bombing raid 
Monday by defiantly intensifying an artillery assault on the city of Gorazde, 
barricading U.N. troops in Sarajevo and severing contacts with mediators trying 
to broker peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian tank and artillery fire on the densely populated eastern city that is 
a U.N.-designated "safe haven" continued even after two U.S. jets bombed rebel 
artillery positions for a second day. 
</P>
<P>
 The air strikes destroyed one Serbian tank and damaged two others, Maj. Dacre 
Holloway, a U.N. spokesman, said after the American F/A-18s dropped three bombs 
on the rebel position at 2:19 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Serbs continued to bombard the mostly Muslim enclave of 65,000, 
inflicting the heaviest casualties on the civilian population since the 
offensive began two weeks ago, according to U.N. officials and Western relief 
workers in Gorazde. Later in the day, however, the Serbian attacks stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 A French physician from the international relief group Doctors Without Borders 
told reporters here in a ham radio exchange that 62 had been killed in the 
previous 24 hours, bringing the two-week death toll to more than 150. 
</P>
<P>
 The unrelenting attack prompted British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, the U.N. 
commander for Bosnia, to threaten further reprisals unless the belligerence 
stopped speedily. "You've got 10 minutes or you get it again," Holloway quoted 
Rose as telling Serbs in his final warning. 
</P>
<P>
 The last heavy-artillery shell reported by U.N. monitors in the besieged 
pocket landed at 4:09 p.m., said Maj. Rob Annink, chief spokesman for the 
13,000-strong U.N. mission in Bosnia. That was about 25 minutes after Rose's 
ultimatum, and shells continued to fall farther south for an hour longer, other 
U.N. sources reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The defiant posture of the rebels, who massively outgun the Bosnian government 
forces but present a pitiful match for NATO, suggested a deadly showdown may be 
in the offing between the Serbian nationalists, who have conquered 70% of 
Bosnia, and the Western powers that have long relied on diplomacy in their 
frustrated effort to stop the war. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbian actions were a coordinated effort at belligerence after the first 
deadly air strike Sunday and demonstrated that the rebels were not yet prepared 
to back down. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunmen loyal to Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and Gen. Ratko Mladic, 
his fiercely nationalist military commander, erected barricades across the sole 
access road to Sarajevo airport and barred U.N. personnel, diplomats and 
foreign journalists from entering or leaving the city. 
</P>
<P>
 All humanitarian relief flights and aid convoys were suspended as a security 
precaution, but an official of the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees in Sarajevo reported what appeared to be deliberate targeting of the 
relief agency's staff and facilities in Gorazde. One shell landed so close to 
the U.N. refugee agency office that it blew the windows out and sent the staff 
running for cover in basement shelters, said agency spokesman Kris Janowski. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13 U.N. military personnel in Gorazde also came under sniper fire from 
Serbian positions and were forced to take cover in their bunkers, U.N. sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A statement issued from Karadzic's mountain stronghold in Pale, about 10 miles 
east of Sarajevo, said the Bosnian Serbs were breaking all contacts with the 
U.N. Protection Force. 
</P>
<P>
 The only remaining channel of communication with the rebels appears to be 
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly S. Churkin, who met with Serbian leaders 
in Belgrade and then headed for consultations with Karadzic and Mladic. 
</P>
<P>
 Churkin expressed confidence after his talks with Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic that he can rescue the negotiations aimed at an overall peace 
settlement in Bosnia. He offered an implied criticism of the Bosnian Serb 
hard-liners for escalating the Gorazde offensive to crisis proportions. 
</P>
<P>
 Churkin, Russia's special envoy for the troubled Balkans, echoed Russian 
President Boris N. Yeltsin's criticism of the NATO air actions, saying they 
were conducted without appropriate consultation with Moscow. But he conceded 
that the Western alliance had been provoked into embarking on the "slippery 
slope" of intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 Milosevic, seen as the mastermind of the Greater Serbia campaign that has kept 
the Balkans in conflict for the past three years, publicly lambasted the U.N. 
resort to air strikes as "shattering the illusion of international impartiality 
over Bosnia." He accused the U.N. Protection Force of intervening on behalf of 
the Bosnian Muslims, who have suffered the brunt of the war's casualties and 
displacement at the hands of Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Momcilo Krajisnik, head of the rogue Bosnian Serb Parliament, denounced the 
air strikes as "a great blow to peace." Another rebel hard-liner, Biljana 
Plavsic, described the United Nations as an aggressor against the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The peace process is in danger and full responsibility lies with the U.N.," 
said a Serbian statement carried by the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug. "The Serbs 
will not be intimidated and will retain the right to self-defense using all 
available means." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Redman, special U.S. envoy for the former Yugoslav republics, conceded 
that the negotiations he, Churkin and U.N. officials have been mediating will 
be on hold until the crisis in Gorazde is calmed. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. spokesman Annink defended the U.N. actions. "We have shown restraint and 
also shown the Serbs what we could and would do" if they persist with the 
offensive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarajevans praised the air strikes as a warning to Serbs that their deadly 
rebellion must stop, but they complained bitterly that the intervention, two 
years after the insurgence began, has arrived too late for the 200,000 killed 
in the war. "It has come very late, but in any case it is worth it," said Ahmed 
Novo, a young Sarajevo doctor enjoying a rare day off at a cafe with his 
girlfriend. "It is important that the international community show that this 
aggression has to be stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 In a ham radio communication between Gorazde and the Bosnian presidency 
building here, Gorazde city official Esad Ohranovic described Monday's shelling 
as "the worst day" of the war. Serbian gunmen, having advanced in tanks and 
armored personnel carriers, were fighting with troops of the Muslim-led 
government hand to hand in the southern suburbs of the city, Ohranovic said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he described the population as relieved after the first air strikes and 
uplifted by the second demonstration that the United Nations is serious about 
forcing the Serbs to stand down. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a kind of celebration; everyone was very happy but worried about 
the day after," Ohranovic said of the atmosphere in Gorazde after Sunday's 
attack. "What happened this morning proved nothing was solved. After the second 
air strike, all the people were very happy." 
</P>
<P>
 The bombardment remained unrelenting, with shells falling as rapidly as one 
every few seconds, until rain and low clouds deprived the Serbs of the 
advantage of artillery cover from afar. NATO planes buzzed the Serbian 
artillery positions repeatedly throughout the day and fired illuminating flares 
at the rebel armor as part of an escalated series of warnings before the air 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials said after nightfall that Mladic had conveyed to Rose his 
assurances that the Serbian offensive was over. Similar promises that the 
shelling had stopped were also issued before and after the first air strikes 
Sunday, in which as many as 15 Serbian fighters were reported to have been 
killed or wounded. Drawing The Line 
</P>
<P>
 Considered the chief aggressors in the 2-year-old war, the Serbs are 
determined to carve out large sections of Bosnia, particularly in eastern 
Bosnia, which borders Serbia proper, to create a "Greater Serbia." The air 
strikes reflect the international community's resolve not to let this happen. 
</P>
<P>
 SUNDAY 
</P>
<P>
 1) F-16s attacked command post and artillery sites. 
</P>
<P>
 MONDAY 
</P>
<P>
 2) F-18s used 20mm cannon and MK-82 bombs to strike Bosnian Serb positions, 
southwest of town. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs control all but these 3 areas in eastern Bosnia. Gorazde would 
help bid to create "Greates Serbia."

CLINTONS PAY $14,615 FOR TAX ERRORS IN '79-80 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on Monday paid $14,615 
in back taxes and interest on newly discovered profits from Mrs. Clinton's 
commodity trading in 1979-80. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Clintons do not know how the error occurred but accept responsibility for 
it," said the Clintons' personal attorney, David E. Kendall. "They view it as 
their duty to come forward, disclose the mistake and pay what is owed." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior White House aide said that previous statements about Mrs. Clinton's 
trading are now "inoperative." 
</P>
<P>
 Documents detailing the trading gains were found among the Clintons' personal 
records within the last week, but aides could not explain why they were not 
available at the time the couple prepared their income tax forms 14 years ago. 
The newly found $6,498 in profits from commodities trading in 1979-80 was 
simply "overlooked" at the time, a senior Administration aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new profits are in addition to the nearly $100,000 in gains that Mrs. 
Clinton made trading in cattle futures with powerful friend James B. Blair at 
the Springdale, Ark., office of a major Chicago commodities brokerage. 
Officials said Monday that the Internal Revenue Service audited the 1979 return 
on which most of those gains were reported and found it to be in order. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton later made trades in a separate account at Stephens Inc. in 
Little Rock, Ark., which the White House described less than two weeks ago as a 
money loser. Officials at that time provided documents which showed that the 
second account was opened with a $5,000 deposit and closed after Mrs. Clinton 
lost $1,009. 
</P>
<P>
 But a review of the couple's records revealed that the account in fact yielded 
a $6,498 profit on a variety of trades in sugar, copper, wheat and lumber 
futures, some of them in substantial amounts. The Clintons are now paying 
$3,315 in back taxes and $10,134 in interest to the federal government and $514 
in back taxes and $652 in interest to the state of Arkansas on that unreported 
gain. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers described the $6,498 profit as "a 
small amount of income that was previously undetected." 
</P>
<P>
 Kendall noted that the statute of limitations on tax evasion has long since 
passed and that the Clintons were making the back payments voluntarily. He said 
that the interest charges were calculated from IRS and Arkansas revenue 
department tables. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first acknowledgment of money due the government by the Clintons 
since extensive scrutiny of their finances began in connection with the 
controversy surrounding their investment in Whitewater Development Corp. while 
Clinton was governor of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Records on that land deal are expected to be released in Little Rock today by 
the Clintons' partner in the failed land development, James B. McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the back-tax payment, the White House also acknowledged that in 
the main trading account, Blair directed virtually all of the trades, contrary 
to earlier assertions that Mrs. Clinton placed her own trades. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's become clear that he (Blair) placed most of the trades," Myers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the trades first came to light last month, the White House had said that 
Blair was one among several advisers. Aides said initially that Mrs. Clinton 
decided when to enter the volatile cattle futures market and directed her 
broker, Robert L. (Red) Bone, on when and what to trade for her account. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials said Monday that Blair in fact ordered the majority of trades in 
Mrs. Clinton's account, while insisting that the fortuitous decision to bail 
out of cattle futures in July, 1979, just before a major crash in the market, 
was Mrs. Clinton's alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we were as clear as we should have been on how exactly the 
trades were executed," Myers acknowledged Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House also moved to clear up misstatements last week by the 
President, who said that Mrs. Clinton's decision to get out of the risky 
commodities market came shortly before their daughter, Chelsea, was born and 
because Mrs. Clinton had received a margin call. A brokerage house demands a 
higher margin account balance when the potential losses exceed the amount of 
money available in a customer's account to cover them. 
</P>
<P>
 But a senior White House aide who briefed reporters on the newly found trading 
records said that he had found no evidence Mrs. Clinton was ever subjected to a 
margin call. 
</P>
<P>
 The new documents also reveal that Mrs. Clinton was actively placing large 
commodities orders in January, February and March of 1980 -- at one point 
purchasing $61,250 in copper futures. 
</P>
<P>
 The President said that his wife got "cold feet" and bailed out of the market 
before Chelsea was born on Feb. 27, 1980. But the very week of Chelsea's birth, 
Mrs. Clinton bought $29,164.80 worth of sugar futures, $41,340 worth of lumber 
futures and $51,450 worth of copper futures. The three trades netted her more 
than $10,700 in profit. 
</P>
<P>
 She liquidated most of her commodities positions in March and closed out the 
account in May with the $6,498 profit that White House aides just discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House also provided more complete records of her successful foray 
into the cattle futures market in 1978 and 1979. There were 31 individual 
trades executed in Mrs. Clinton's account between October, 1978, and July, 
1979, yielding a net profit of $98,537 on an initial investment of $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 31 trades, 26 were winners and only five were losers, a batting average 
that astounds commodities market experts. More than three quarters of futures 
players lose money, and Mrs. Clinton's success as a neophyte was remarkable, 
traders have said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to answer critics who claim that Mrs. Clinton was the recipient 
of a sweetheart deal or the beneficiary of money-making trades allocated to her 
account after the fact, the White House engaged Leo Melamed, former chairman of 
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, to review her trading records. 
</P>
<P>
 Melamed, in a statement released by the White House, said: "What these records 
show is that Mrs. Clinton was, during 1978 and 1979, a relatively modest trader 
who traded in a variety of commodities, including cattle, soybeans and hogs. 
She paid normal, full commissions. She made money on a lot of trades, lost 
money on some -- sometimes these losses were substantial -- and, on balance, 
she did extremely well. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Clinton was clearly receiving very good and well-educated advice, as she 
had every right to do and as she has herself acknowledged," Melamed said. In 
his opinion, he said, she "violated no rules in the course of these 
transactions." 
</P>
<P>
 Melamed said it appeared that Mrs. Clinton's broker or someone else was 
executing successful trades on her behalf but described her profits as 
"minuscule when measured against the background" of a booming market in cattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Melamed also noted that Mrs. Clinton at times traded on insufficient margin 
and would not be allowed to trade today with such a small initial investment 
and low net worth. He said these were violations by her broker, Ray E. Friedman 
& Co., and not by Mrs. Clinton.

BELGIANS FLEEING RWANDA AS ETHNIC KILLINGS MOUNT; CENTRAL AFRICA: MANY 
FOREIGNERS STILL AWAIT RESCUE IN BELEAGUERED CAPITAL. CEASE-FIRE ACCORD FAILS 
TO TAKE HOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Amid continued fighting and tales of horrific carnage, the emergency 
evacuation of Westerners from Rwanda gathered pace Monday as more than 100 
Belgian nationals were flown out of the country and others awaited rescue in 
the beleaguered capital, Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 The Belgian Defense Ministry here said that about 250 of the 3,000 Belgians 
working in Rwanda had been flown to Nairobi, Kenya, by late Monday and that 
others were expected to leave the war-torn country soon, despite the dangers of 
the rescue operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Frederic Francois, a Belgian television reporter in the capital, reported that 
a Belgian military convoy moving from Kigali's airport into the city had been 
caught briefly in fighting Monday between the mainly Hutu government forces and 
units of the dissident Rwandan Patriotic Front, a rebel army made up mainly of 
ethnic Tutsi. "Like every night, we've heard bullets whistling through the 
Kigali night," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other reports of convoys of Westerners -- seeking to avoid some of 
the heaviest fighting on the main approach road to the airport -- making their 
way through muddy side streets littered with bodies and echoing with the moans 
of wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 But the worst reports of atrocities seemed to come Monday from hospitals, 
where troops were said to have slaughtered patients, some in their beds as they 
awaited treatment. In one incident, soldiers repeatedly bayoneted two 
civilians, who had sought medical care, in full of view of doctors, nurses and 
patients in a crowded emergency room of Kigali's central hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Francois reported that about 150 or 160 Westerners of various nationalities 
had taken shelter at a French school in Kigali as they awaited evacuation, 
while another 40 Belgians had arrived in the capital from outlying areas. There 
were also reports that bands of mainly young Rwandan men armed with machetes, 
spears and bows and arrows were roaming the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lack of security here is total," Francois said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 400 Belgian troops are now in Rwanda as part of the rescue operation, 
and Belgian Defense Minister Leo Delcroix indicated Sunday that it could be 
days before all remaining aid and development workers from his country are 
airlifted to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 A Defense Ministry spokesman here said an agreed-upon cease-fire between the 
two warring groups had still failed to take hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Kigali, the cease-fire has not held," Col. Freddy van der Weghe told 
reporters. "The (Rwandan) army has been firing sporadically using heavy 
weapons. The situation is still unstable, (and) there is still shooting between 
the RPF and the army." 
</P>
<P>
 He said there were unconfirmed reports that a Rwandan Patriotic Front 
battalion had entered the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of French, Americans and other Westerners trapped by the 
convulsion of violence and ethnic warfare that erupted in the Central African 
nation after last Wednesday's apparent presidential assassination have 
reportedly already fled the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest frenzy of violence between Rwanda's majority Hutus and minority 
Tutsi may have left as many as 20,000 dead, according to an estimate by the 
International Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 Belgian national television, which put the death toll in Kigali alone at 
10,000, aired footage that showed streets littered with bodies. Victims in the 
slaughter have included priests, nuns and local employees of international 
assistance agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 In one incident, members of the French-based medical assistance organization 
Doctors Without Borders arrived Sunday morning at a tent hospital where they 
had been treating the wounded, only to find that more than 100 of their 
patients had been murdered by soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 A Swiss radio reporter told Belgian television Sunday that he entered a 
church, apparently in the Kigali area, and found the bodies of an estimated 70 
Tutsi, many of them women and small children. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-simmering suspicions of Belgium, the former colonial power in Rwanda, 
along with rumors that Belgians were somehow involved in the death of President 
Juvenal Habyarimana, have severely complicated the rescue of Belgian nationals. 
Habyarimana was killed Wednesday when the plane carrying him and Burundian 
President Cyprian Ntayamira crashed as it prepared to land in Kigali. Rwandan 
officials said it was shot down by unidentified attackers. 
</P>
<P>
 Forces believed to be part of the Rwandan army or the elite Presidential Guard 
initially prevented Belgian air force C-130 transport planes from landing at 
Kigali, and there have been several reports of Belgian nationals being harassed 
by Rwandan troops as they tried to flee the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 The government here confirmed Monday that six Belgian civilians had been 
killed in the unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the capital Monday, the Belgian Defense Ministry reported conditions 
were quiet in the country's second- and third-largest cities, Butare in the 
south and Gisenye in the north, but heavy fighting was said to have occurred in 
the northern town of Ruhengeri.

UKRAINIAN RAID HEIGHTENS FLEET DISPUTE WITH RUSSIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAREY GOLDBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russian-Ukrainian relations rose to the boiling point Monday after 120 
Ukrainian navy commandos seized a maintenance base of the Black Sea Fleet near 
Odessa in a late night raid that reportedly injured some Russian sailors and 
their family members. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ukrainian Defense Ministry denied that anyone was hurt when commandos took 
over the fleet's 318th Division of reserve ships Sunday night. But it 
acknowledged that it had moved in to arrest three Black Sea Fleet officers for 
their role in an incident Saturday that brought Russian and Ukrainian sailors 
almost to the point of shooting at each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Versions of the Odessa events varied, but all sides agreed that the last three 
days have seen the worst escalation yet of the Russian-Ukrainian tension over 
control of the Black Sea Fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Odessa incident is the most large-scale and daring anti-Russian action 
ever carried out by Ukraine," a Russian diplomat in charge of relations with 
Ukraine told the Interfax news agency. The Russian government demanded the 
immediate release of the three officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukraine's Defense Ministry, for its part, called Russian reports of the 
arrests "an outrageous and provocative lie." It said the Russians had been 
arrested for participating in "piracy" and reported by Monday evening that 
Ukrainian troops had left the maintenance base, although the three officers 
remained under arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking up the Black Sea Fleet, which numbers some 300 ships and was once the 
pride of the Soviet navy, has been fraught with conflict since the Soviet 
Union's collapse in late 1991. The Russian and Ukrainian presidents agreed to 
share control of the fleet for a transitional period, but friction has 
continued unabated. 
</P>
<P>
 The political situation in Crimea, where the fleet is based, adds yet another 
volatile element. Crimea belongs to Ukraine, but more than half its residents 
are Russian and separatist sentiment is growing under a new Crimean leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Economics also enters the picture. Russia accuses Ukraine of reneging on its 
obligation to pay for half the upkeep of the Black Sea Fleet, including the 
basic navigational equipment that regulates sea traffic in Crimean ports. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the financial squabbling turned physical. When some high-ranking 
Russian officers of the fleet tried to sail the Cheleken, a ship carrying 
navigational equipment, from Odessa to the fleet's home base in Sevastopol, 
they were stopped by Ukrainian navy officers, who claimed the equipment as 
Ukrainian property. 
</P>
<P>
 The confrontation grew so tense that at one point the Russian officers 
reportedly ordered their men to shoot at the Ukrainians if provoked. The 
Cheleken ended up sailing to Sevastopol. 
</P>
<P>
 The sequel followed late Sunday night, when Ukrainian commandos moved on the 
maintenance base for reserve ships where the Russian officers from the Cheleken 
incident were housed. 
</P>
<P>
 Accounts differ. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said that "there was no 
storming (of the division headquarters) and could not have been." It said the 
division was simply blocked off and the officers -- one the division commander 
-- were arrested, in part to "prevent further provocations." 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian spokesmen for the Black Sea Fleet said that Ukrainian commandos 
staged an assault that left glass broken and civilians injured, including 
children. It said the three Russian officers were led away in handcuffs and 
that Ukrainians took control of the base's coastal facilities, communications 
and weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukrainian commandos are also said to have blockaded another Black Sea Fleet 
division housing navigational equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian navy issued a strident protest, saying the arrests flagrantly 
violated agreements and "create an explosive situation in the Black Sea Fleet." 
The Russian government also protested and demanded that the Russian officers be 
immediately released. 
</P>
<P>
 Tension grew so much that Russian Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin and 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk reportedly discussed the incident in a 
telephone conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 Black Sea Fleet commander Eduard Baltin called the attack "the action of 
uncontrollable gangs." 
</P>
<P>
 The commando raid on the Black Sea base comes at a particularly nervous time 
in the Crimea, when the growing division between pro-Russians and 
pro-Ukrainians has some predicting civil war.

RESEDA WOMAN SOUGHT AFTER PATIENT'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police on Monday were seeking a Reseda woman who they believe administered a 
fatal drug injection to an ailing man while illegally practicing medicine from 
her home. 
</P>
<P>
 Refugio Sandoval, 60, was being sought in the death of Jesus Nicolas Anchondo, 
22, of Arleta, who police say died Sunday after getting an injection from 
Sandoval about 11 a.m. After going into convulsions, he was taken by paramedics 
to Northridge Hospital Medical Center, where he died about noon, a hospital 
spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should be a warning to other people that you have to go see a doctor," 
Anchondo's distraught 22-year-old wife, Maria Almarez, said Monday. Almarez 
said that her husband had gone to see Sandoval because he had no insurance and 
didn't have enough money to see a doctor, and that she didn't even have the 
funds for a proper burial for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities want to question Sandoval and said they were considering seeking 
an arrest warrant on charges of manslaughter and practicing medicine without a 
license. They said she apparently had a large clientele and had been treating 
patients for a variety of ailments for at least five years. One of those 
patients was Anchondo's mother, who told authorities that she had taken her son 
to see Sandoval after he began complaining of strep throat or flu-like 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time authorities arrived at Sandoval's Reseda home after Anchondo's 
death, she had fled, and by nightfall, her seven grown children also were gone, 
police said. She was still at large late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the ramshackle one-story stucco house across from a schoolyard, 
authorities said they found what looked like a pharmacy and doctor's office, 
complete with rows upon rows of medications, and a line of chairs that they 
believe was Sandoval's "waiting room." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no evidence that Sandoval had any actual medical training," said 
homicide Detective Rick Swanston. "We don't know much about her yet. She tells 
people she is a nurse, but we have not been able to find any proof of that 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Swanston said police have information to believe that Sandoval got at least 
some of her medications in Tijuana, and that she was providing significant 
medical care to a steady clientele through word of mouth. "She had a lot of 
patients, we're sure of that," he said. There were no markings on her house to 
indicate that she was running a clinic or business of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of Anchondo's death, Swanston said, police seized "tons of stuff, 
thousands and thousands of pills and vials of medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 "She had everything in the world, hundreds of drugs in there," he said. "She 
had a miniature hospital in her bedroom." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the medicines were labeled in Spanish, including a vial that 
appeared to contain the fluid injected into Anchondo, and that authorities were 
trying to determine their contents. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Swanston nor the Los Angeles County coroner's office would speculate 
on what the vial contained, or even whether it contributed to Anchondo's death. 
Scott Carrier, a coroner's spokesman, said an autopsy is scheduled today for 
Anchondo. "We have to await the results of the autopsy to see what killed him," 
said Swanston. "He didn't appear to have anything that serious before he was 
given the injection." 
</P>
<P>
 One woman who said she was a client of Sandoval's told The Times that the 
woman was known as Dona Cuca , a respectful term for a woman, and that she had 
treated her -- and her mother's injured foot -- with oils but never with 
injections. 
</P>
<P>
 The client, who asked not to be identified, said she had an appointment with 
Sandoval on Sunday, but that when she arrived at the house in the 8100 block of 
Hesperia Avenue, no one was there. She said mutual acquaintances and Sandoval's 
neighbors said she had possibly gone to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchondo's family and colleagues said Sandoval was known as a curandera , or a 
Latino who practices his or her own brand of medicine mixing herbal remedies, 
scientific practices and folklore. 
</P>
<P>
 Some said they had heard about her practice, which authorities and medical 
experts say is common in some Latino communities in Southern California, where 
drugs and medications can be bought at swap meets and black-market locations 
and then used on those who lack the money to see a legitimate doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Unauthorized sales of prescription drugs and other items have soared in some 
immigrant communities in recent years, as newcomers bring with them informal 
practices of their homelands, where such drugs are more easily obtained over 
the counter, health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're only beginning to understand the extent of the problem," said Prosy 
Abarquez-Delacruz, regional administrator of the state Department of Health 
Services' food and drug branch in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have cited at least one case in recent years where a woman was 
prosecuted for selling an injectable medication at a Sun Valley swap meet after 
the patient died under mysterious circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Anchondo's colleagues at the Olga underwear warehouse in Commerce said 
Anchondo was working on his blue 1978 Cutlass Sunday morning when he began 
feeling ill, complaining of a sore throat and other problems, and saying he 
needed some penicillin. Anchondo's wife -- who accompanied him to Sandoval's 
house along with Anchondo's mother -- said he was given an injection and fell 
down almost immediately, according to the colleague, Alex Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchondo, who has a 3-year-old son, Nicholas, was a very friendly and 
hard-working man, who grew up in the Pacoima-Arleta area and was attending 
night school to get his high school equivalency degree, Lee said. He was among 
half a dozen of Anchondo's colleagues who visited his house Monday to pay their 
respects. 
</P>
<P>
 "He talked a lot about giving his kid a better life," said Lee. "He was a 
hard-working family man." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said they had seen a steady stream of people coming and going at 
Sandoval's house, but that it was hard to separate potential clients from those 
visiting her many children. At least two neighbors said people had come to 
their door, asking for the house number where Sandoval lived, or simply asking 
for "the nurse." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of visitors," said neighbor Martin Carvajal, 29. "I thought 
they were selling drugs or something." 
</P>
<P>
 Another neighbor, Alberto Corral, 13, said: "Every time I'd walk by, you'd see 
people coming in and out." 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Valderrama, 25, who lived across the street, said he frequently wondered 
whether all the traffic was due to some kind of illicit activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every night there'd be a few different cars," he said. "But if you did think 
they were doing something illegal, you'd never think it was alternative 
medicine. That's the last thing you'd expect."

THE PR PUSH IN SACRAMENTO; POLITICS: PUBLIC RELATIONS ENTREPRENEURS SHAPE 
OPINION ON LEGISLATION IN WAYS LOBBYISTS CANNOT. TERM LIMITS HAVE MADE THEM A 
KEY PART OF THE CAPITOL EQUATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the day that Gov. Pete Wilson called the Legislature into special session 
to reform the state's workers' compensation system, Los Angeles businessman 
Michael Stennis was on "NBC Nightly News" making the case for reform.  
</P>
<P>
 "I can survive riots, I can survive crime," said Stennis, who runs a 
family-owned chain of fast-food restaurants. "I can survive a lot of things, 
but I cannot survive workers' compensation insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 Stennis' appearance on the network was no lucky coincidence. It was the work 
of a Sacramento public relations firm, RF Communications, run by a onetime 
legislative staffer and former television news producer, Don Fields, whose 
client was a group calling itself Californians for Compensation Reform. (Months 
later, the workers' comp system was revamped.) 
</P>
<P>
 Fields is among a growing number of public relations entrepreneurs hired to 
shape the course of events here. There are about a dozen such firms at work 
today and their job is to sell their client's view of pending legislation -- 
the way other public relations agencies market laundry detergent or political 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry is likely to be in greater demand as term limits take hold. As 
lobbyists rely less on long-term relationships for access to lawmakers, they 
will use other ways to get their clients' views across to the decision-makers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What people are realizing is that you can't just hire a lobbyist and get the 
job done," said veteran lobbyist George Steffes. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the public relations companies, employing old-fashioned media skills and 
new technology to win support or build opposition to legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, these firms have been deployed in battles over the way beer 
is stored and distributed, which prescription drugs are available to Medi-Cal 
patients, investment tax breaks for business, spending on education, and smog 
checks for automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though they are openly in business to influence legislators, few of these 
public relations firms or their employees register as lobbyists. The rules do 
not require them to register because many never have direct contact with a 
lawmaker on behalf of clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they do their work indirectly, planting stories and editorials, 
taking out ads, organizing letter-writing and phone-in campaigns, and putting 
together coalitions of special interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Some employ the latest in computer technology, allowing them to identify 
sympathetic constituents in a key legislator's district and then connecting 
them through a toll-free call to the lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Practitioners of this technique describe it as "prospecting" -- finding those 
with strongly held views identical to a client's. With this technique, they can 
quickly generate thousands of postcards or mobilize a demonstration on the 
Capitol steps. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Critics complain that it can be difficult to distinguish between a genuine 
outpouring of public interest and a display fabricated to meet the needs of 
wealthy clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not everybody can afford these sophisticated efforts," said Robert Stern, 
co-director of the Center for Governmental Studies in Los Angeles. "The 
consequence is you get . . . skewed information and, perhaps, skewed support 
that does not really reflect how the public feels about things." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood) has introduced a bill that would 
require more detailed disclosure of the payments made for this indirect form of 
lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
 "My quarrel is not the right of anyone or any interest group to advance their 
point of view, but they ought not to be able to do it under cover of darkness," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At its first committee hearing this month, the measure mustered only two of 
the four votes needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, Sacramento lobbyists lagged behind Washington in employing 
public relations techniques to influence legislation. In the nation's capital, 
PR agencies have perfected the art of drowning congressional offices in a 
torrent of letters and phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Public relations firms and legislators in Sacramento say that such a brute 
force approach would not work so well in the state capital -- where tying up a 
lawmaker's phone lines can have the opposite of the intended effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Being successful requires an understanding of what makes California officials 
tick. So it is not surprising that many of those in the business have 
backgrounds in government or strong ties to politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Bobbie Metzger, who runs the Sacramento office of Stoorza, Ziegaus, 
Metzger & Hunt, now one of the largest independent public relations firms in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Metzger was a press secretary for former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown and 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). Her husband, Michael Galizio, 
is the Speaker's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Her political connections have made her an object of criticism as well as envy 
among her peers. 
</P>
<P>
 Metzger said she makes it clear to her clients that she will not lobby the 
Speaker, other lawmakers or anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always say it in black and white: 'If you are hiring me because you think I 
can help you with the Speaker, don't. I can't and I won't,' and I say it every 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 But Metzger acknowledges that the Assembly leader is one of her closest 
friends and that her knowledge of the way he and other legislators operate can 
be helpful to her clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of her Democratic connections, a visitor to her office is struck by a 
personal letter from Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, thanking her for her firm's 
help in planning his 1991 inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not as surprising as it seems. Partner Alan Ziegaus is a longtime 
friend of Wilson and a senior counsel to the Republican governor's reelection 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 As at other firms, a big part of Metzger's job is preparing information 
packets for distribution to the media as well as lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hired to fight a proposed tax on snack food, the company began sending out 
collections of food for nibbling to make the point that "a granola bar wasn't a 
snack, but a candy bar with the same ingredients was. . . . It was so visual, 
so quantifiable," she said 
</P>
<P>
 The snack tax passed, only to be repealed by voter initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the PR professionals learned their craft by working on political 
campaigns and regard it as a new application of campaign techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a campaign attitude about winning and losing, versus the traditional 
PR attitude, which is getting attention," said David Townsend, whose firm, 
Townsend, Hermocillo, Raimundo & Usher, continues to run initiative campaigns 
but not partisan races.  
</P>
<P>
 Among his clients are the state's grocers, who opposed a series of bills to 
change the way beer is distributed. The legislation backed by beer and wine 
wholesalers would have required all beer to be stored in licensed warehouses 
before delivery -- making it more difficult for the big supermarkets to offer 
discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Townsend company put out lengthy position papers referring to the 
wholesalers as "the beer barons" and arguing that the measures would raise the 
price of a six-pack. News reporters were given lists of campaign contributions 
to lawmakers from the bills' backers. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm helped generate 37,000 postcards to the governor and key legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, the beer wholesalers hired Nelson & Lucas Communications, another 
well-connected PR firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The president of the company, Donna Lucas, was an aide to Republican Gov. 
George Deukmejian and state Treasurer Thomas Hayes. Lucas' partner is Robert 
Nelson -- a Republican who headed Republicans for Clinton/Gore and served on 
the President-elect's transition team. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas' firm quickly developed a counter-strategy on the beer bills, labeling 
the grocers as the "chain gang" and arguing that the purpose of the bills was 
to give mom-and-pop grocers and liquor stores a chance to compete with the 
supermarket chains. The agency compiled a list of more than 7,400 small 
retailers who supported the bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one of the seven bills in the package was enacted -- requiring 
out-of-state beer manufacturers to post their prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other firms, Lucas' team knows the value of putting together broad 
coalitions so that her client's position will not be seen as narrow or 
self-serving. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Assn. of Ophthalmology hired Lucas to fight a bill allowing 
optometrists to treat patients they are measuring for lenses with prescription 
medications for eye diseases. The bill became a classic turf battle between the 
state's ophthalmologists, who are medical doctors, and optometrists, who 
proposed it. 
</P>
<P>
 To help make the case against the bill, Lucas' firm brought in other groups 
"so when you go to testify in committee, you don't just have the 
ophthalmologists, who clearly have a financial stake, you have the diversity of 
a coalition." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those contacted was the California Council of the Blind. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's lobbyist, Ysidro (Cid) Urena, who is blind, testified against the 
measure before a key Senate committee, arguing that allowing optometrists to 
treat eye disease would result in more blindness. (The study he cited was done 
on behalf of the ophthalmologists, and is hotly disputed by the optometrists.) 
</P>
<P>
 The bill was defeated.

'ONE-STRIKE' BILL FOR SEX CRIMES STIRS DEBATE; LEGISLATION: PROPONENTS SAY 
MEASURE IS NEEDED TO KEEP RAPISTS AND CHILD MOLESTERS FROM BECOMING REPEAT 
OFFENDERS. OPPONENTS SAY IT IS TOO BROAD AND WOULD SEND PRISON COSTS 
SKYROCKETING. 
</P>

<P>
 The awful facts are straightforward, simple. She was the victim of a brutal 
rape. The assailant was caught and convicted on 28 counts involving 11 women. 
He got 153 years in prison. But it is Catherine C. who feels like the one 
serving a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the Orange County woman continues to salve the emotional wounds she 
suffered in the 1988 attack, her anger has grown over society's attitude toward 
rape. Although her attacker will probably never leave prison, she learned that 
such stiff sentences are the exception rather than the rule in California, 
where rapists average less than five years behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like others, I will live with the effects of this rape for the rest of my 
life," she said. "It only seems fair that perpetrators should face the same 
consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 She might soon get her wish. Buffeted by gusts of anti-crime sentiment 
sweeping the state in this election year, the Legislature is considering a 
"one-strike" measure that would put rapists and child molesters behind bars for 
life after a first conviction. It would be the strictest such penalty in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, sponsored by Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) at the behest of 
Gov. Pete Wilson, has been championed forcefully by victims of rape and 
molestation such as Catherine, who came forward with several others last week 
to provide compelling personal testimony at a televised Capitol public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 While she and other boosters suggest that a "one-strike" law would mete out an 
appropriate penalty and could help begin to curb rape and molestation, 
opponents contend that the proposal goes too far, setting a dangerous precedent 
as the state and nation grapple with how best to get tough on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics argue that Bergeson's bill would send incarceration costs skyrocketing 
and, in cases of date rape or incest, have a chilling effect on victims, 
witnesses, jurors and prosecutors, potentially making it more difficult to put 
sex offenders behind bars. They also say the measure loses sight of 
rationality, blindly boosting penalties to the limit instead of carefully 
ratcheting up sentences for varying degrees of sex crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't the drafting of penal law; this is the crayoning in of punishments 
on an apparently arbitrary basis," said Franklin Zimring, a professor of law at 
UC Berkeley. "Penal law reform has become a branch of the theater of the 
absurd." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents tried to water down the Bergeson bill during last week's Senate 
Judiciary hearing, as Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) threatened to add language 
making only the most heinous rapists or molesters subject to a "one-strike" 
penalty. An uneasy Bergeson pulled the bill back and asked for more time to 
work with opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are legitimately concerned about public safety and tired of repeat 
offenders who seem to be inadequately punished," Lockyer said later. "But I 
want the Legislature to produce a statute that's appropriate and not overreact 
because it's fashionable (to pass harsh crime laws) in an election year." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson and officials in the governor's office remain resolute, saying they 
will not compromise on the legislation. "The bottom line is we release 250 
convicted sex offenders from prison in California each month," Bergeson said. 
"To me, that is unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 She contends that a tough "one-strike" measure is needed because most 
perpetrators of sex crimes are repeat offenders. "I don't want to give them a 
chance at that second victim." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say some evidence demonstrates otherwise. A 15-year study concluded in 
1988 by the state Department of Justice found that about 20% of all sex 
offenders were arrested again for a similar crime. Lockyer and others suggest 
that the statistics paint an ominous scenario: The "one-strike" bill might 
unnecessarily incarcerate for life the four of five offenders who would not 
likely commit another sex crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But experts in mental health suggest that rehabilitation of sex offenders 
remains an elusive goal. "The research right now indicates we have not 
discovered the cure," said Stephen Mayberg, director of the state Department of 
Mental Health. "We aren't able to provide treatments that make a substantial 
difference, particularly for rapists and pedophiles." 
</P>
<P>
 Few of the bill's opponents dispute that repeat violent rapists and molesters 
deserve to be put away for life. But they express concerns about handing out 
such extreme punishment in every sex crime case, suggesting a blanket life 
sentence for all might actually boost the number that get away. 
</P>
<P>
 In less sensational cases, juries might acquit if they believed that the 
penalty did not match the crime. Prosecutors could become reluctant to press 
charges. People assaulted by friends or family might refuse to cooperate with 
authorities once they learned of the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics suggest that the proposed law amounts to cruel and unusual 
punishment. They note that a life sentence would apply if two people were 
intoxicated during sexual intercourse and one reported a rape after sobering 
up. The bill also would impose a life term for spousal rape, which may now be 
charged as a misdemeanor. Molesters who forcefully fondled a child under age 14 
through clothing also could be hit with life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should marital rape be considered more serious than unaggravated 
first-degree murder, attempted murder, mayhem?" Zimring asked. "Having 
relations with someone under 14 is a serious crime, but is it worse than 
murder?" 
</P>
<P>
 Under current law, rape and many other violent sex crimes are punishable by 
sentences ranging from three to eight years for a single count on a first 
offense. Francisco Lobaco, the American Civil Liberties Union's state 
legislative director, contends that those terms are tough enough. Rapists often 
serve consecutive prison sentences, with additional counts adding to their time 
behind bars. The most violent perpetrators of sex crimes, he said, "get very, 
very long sentences" as the law now stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Others worry because rape and molestation have among the highest rates of 
false arrests, increasing the odds that innocent people could be incarcerated 
for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimring finds it troubling. "All around us, we're having this enormous debate 
about recovered-memory cases and in the middle of it up walks the governor with 
a proposal to make incest a crime punishable by life in prison without the 
possibility of parole," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boosters of the Bergeson "one-strike" bill contend that such arguments should 
not eclipse the most pressing reality they see: Sentences for rape and 
molestation are not tough enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had a peashooter to deal with my massive problem," said Donna F., whose 
father was convicted of incest. "We've got to have a change. Maybe this bill 
goes too deep and we need to fix it, but we've got to have a change."

WELFARE PLAN GOUGES STATE, LAWMAKERS SAY; LEGISLATION: CALIFORNIA WOULD LIKELY 
RECEIVE FAR LESS FEDERAL FUNDS FOR IMMIGRANT PROGRAMS UNDER REFORM PROPOSAL BY 
CLINTON, POLITICIANS AND LOCAL OFFICIALS WARN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 California would pay a disproportionate share of welfare reform costs if the 
Clinton Administration proceeds with plans to fund new programs by reducing 
benefits to legal immigrants, California members of Congress and local 
officials warned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The still-to-be-released Administration proposal, along with competing welfare 
reform measures awaiting action in Congress, would divert money from benefits 
for low-income legal immigrants to job-training and child-care programs for all 
welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 California, with its large immigrant population, receives more than 40% of 
federal dollars spent on immigrant programs; the state is likely to receive 
less than 20% of the job-training and child-care dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 While California has a large share of the country's non-citizen immigrants -- 
36% -- and a large percentage of them are poor, the number of citizens on 
welfare are not disproportionate compared to other states. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money taken out of the state would be far greater than the money that 
would come in for increased services," said Robert Greenstein, executive 
director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "California would be 
financing welfare reform for much of the rest of the country." 
</P>
<P>
 "This could have a substantial impact on the state of California and local 
governments," said Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento). "It's unbelievable 
what may happen to L.A. County, where there are a lot of recent immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
 Presidential adviser Bruce Reed, a key architect of the Administration's 
welfare reform plan, said "it's not clear that California would be a net loser" 
under the plan because the state would be freed from some of its obligations to 
support legal immigrants. The immigrants' sponsors would be forced to make up 
the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 But California officials said they fear that the state would be overwhelmed by 
the numbers of indigent immigrants applying for general assistance and medical 
benefits if they lost federal and state aid under the Supplemental Security 
Income program. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people still have to find ways to survive," Matsui said. "The taxpayers 
in California will end up paying for it." 
</P>
<P>
 The SSI program provides monthly benefits of up to $446 for indigent 
individuals and $669 for couples who are blind, disabled or elderly and 
ineligible for Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of legal non-citizen immigrants receiving SSI assistance nationally 
has surged from about 128,000 in 1982 to 601,000 today. The Administration -- 
in an effort to fulfill the President's pledge to "end welfare as we know it" 
without increasing costs -- is designing a plan that would limit welfare 
payments (primarily Aid to Families With Dependent Children) to two years and 
provide more job training, child care and subsidized employment to help people 
leave the welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it remains unclear how the program would be paid for, the most 
commonly discussed funding sources are a gambling tax and a reduction in SSI 
benefits for immigrants who have sponsors in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsui, an influential member of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on 
human resources, which will consider welfare reform legislation, said support 
is strong in Congress for offsetting the cost of new welfare programs by 
reducing or eliminating immigrants' benefits. Although he said he opposes that 
option, bills introduced by House and Senate Republicans, as well as a 
bipartisan Senate bill introduced Monday, all would divert SSI funds to help 
pay their costs.  
</P>
<P>
 California lawmakers and officials argue that the funding mechanism unfairly 
punishes California for a phenomenon over which it has no control: the large 
number of needy immigrants who choose to live in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "The federal government is abdicating its responsibility to legal immigrants," 
Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles) said. "One of the reasons it has support in 
Congress is that it (the funding plan) only hurts a few states." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration proposes lengthening the period of time before elderly and 
disabled immigrants are eligible for SSI. One option is to make permanent a 
temporary provision passed by Congress last year that makes immigrants eligible 
after five years of residence instead of three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The change would provide from $2.7 billion to $6.8 billion for welfare reform 
during the first year, according to an Administration official, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. The entire welfare reform package, which is likely to 
be introduced in Congress this month or next, is expected to cost between $10 
billion and $13 billion for the first five years. 
</P>
<P>
 A bipartisan welfare reform bill introduced Monday by Sens. Tom Harkin 
(D-Iowa) and Christopher S. Bond (R-Mo.) would rely even more heavily than the 
Administration plan on cuts in immigrant benefits, likely raising the cost to 
California even more. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This measure proposes considering the income of an immigrant's sponsor when 
determining eligibility for Supplemental Security Income, food stamps, Aid For 
Families With Dependent Children and Medicaid, until that immigrant becomes a 
citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan favored by most House Republicans and endorsed by a group of centrist 
Democrats goes much further, cutting the costs of services for legal immigrants 
by $5 billion annually, according to a draft estimate by the Congressional 
Budget Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Although presidential adviser Reed argued that the Administration's proposal 
would not necessarily punish California disproportionately, he said that the 
financing plans in the competing packages would result in a significant "cost 
shift to the states." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the House Republican plan, 520,000 legal immigrants nationwide would 
lose SSI benefits, 950,000 would lose Medicaid benefits, 900,000 would lose 
food stamps and 420,000 would be taken off AFDC rolls, according to an estimate 
by the Congressional Budget Office. Almost 44% of those receiving SSI benefits 
are in California. 
</P>
<P>
 California officials said the proposed funding package would be particularly 
unfair considering that the state's coffers are overburdened by the heavy 
influx of immigrants and that its economic recovery lags far behind the rest of 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of supporting 85,000 non-citizen immigrants in Los Angeles County who 
now receive AFDC would be $146 million, said Bill McFadden, chief of government 
relations at the Department of Public Social Services in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We end up at the very bottom bearing the burden but we have no control over 
the entry of immigrants," said Angelo Doti, director of financial assistance 
for the Orange County Social Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Doti said general relief rolls and county medical costs could rise 
exponentially if plans proceed for funding welfare reform through cuts in legal 
immigrants' benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's really nice that the federal government is trying to protect itself by 
turning off these funding spigots," Doti added sarcastically. "But these people 
don't just go away and their needs don't just go away."

MEDICINE / CANCER RESEARCH; MELANOMA VACCINE REDUCES RECURRENCE, SCIENTISTS 
CLAIM

 Researchers using the diseased cells of melanoma patients have developed a 
vaccine that they say dramatically reduces the recurrence of the deadliest form 
of skin cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers used the vaccine on high-risk patients with advanced 
melanoma.Even after surgery, most patients develop additional tumors and die. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. David Berd of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia said his team 
treated the patients with a vaccine made from their own cancer cells and 
another chemical to stimulate the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
 After three years, 70% of those vaccinated remained cancer-free, compared to 
20% in patients treated with surgery alone, Berd told the American Assn. of 
Cancer Research on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-year study at Jefferson involved 47 patients who had malignant 
melanoma that had spread to regional lymph nodes. They underwent surgery to 
remove the tumors, but such treatments usually fail because cancer cells remain 
in the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the surgery, the researchers gave the patients a vaccine formed 
from their own cancer cells, which were inactivated and coupled with the 
chemical dinitrophenyl, or DNP. The patients also were given cyclophosphamide, 
a commonly used treatment that boosts the immune response. 
</P>
<P>
 After three years, 60% of the vaccinated patients were tumor-free. Ten percent 
suffered a recurrence of tumors, but have remained disease-free since the 
additional tumors were removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Berd said anti-melanoma immunizations for high-risk patients could be 
available within five years if scientists can synthesize the vaccine. "There is 
no reason why it's not applicable to other cancers," Berd said. "A great deal 
of this work has been concentrated in melanoma merely for tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 Cases of the advanced form of melanoma represent a small fraction of the 
disease, which is diagnosed in 32,000 Americans annually.

WOMAN'S BODY HELD WHILE FUME PROBE CONTINUES; INVESTIGATION: RIVERSIDE COUNTY 
OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THEY WILL RELEASE GLORIA RAMIREZ FOR BURIAL IF HER FAMILY 
AGREES NOT TO UNSEAL THE COFFIN. HER RELATIVES HAVE REFUSED TO AGREE TO THE 
CONDITION. 
</P>

<P>
 County health officials hope to decide this week whether to loosen 
restrictions on the release of the body of Gloria Ramirez, whose death in 
February is central to the investigation of the still unexplained fumes that 
felled attendants of a hospital emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have said they would release the body for burial if the woman's 
family agreed not to open the sealed coffin. They said there are still 
unanswered questions about whether her body was the source of the fumes that 
sickened a half dozen people at Riverside General Hospital's emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 But Riverside County spokesman Tom DeSantis said Monday that medical and 
scientific experts this week will analyze what has been learned so far in the 
investigation. "We're hopeful the analysis will shed enough light on this case 
where our public health officer can make a final review on the conditions (for 
the body's release) and determine whether they should remain in place," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the Ramirez family asked for the release of her body last month, 
but refused to accept the county's condition that the coffin remain unopened -- 
prohibiting the family even from confirming that the woman's body was inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the family's protest, the county last week filed a lawsuit, seeking 
a court order to back its position. A hearing was set for Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday -- with Ramirez family attorneys ready to take depositions from 
Riverside County coroner's office staff about what had been learned in the 
investigation -- the county dropped the lawsuit, effectively stopping the 
depositions before they began. 
</P>
<P>
 "We absolutely think the county is trying to protect itself, hide something, 
or is manipulating data," said Ron Schwartz, attorney for the Ramirez family. 
"The family was hoping to learn something (Monday) about the investigation 
through the depositions, and now we've lost that opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 DeSantis said the county dropped the lawsuit seeking the court's support of 
the burial conditions because "we hope by Thursday to know a lot more about 
this case than we know today," making the need for a lawsuit moot.

FOREIGN MEDIATORS TO TRY SOLVING S. AFRICAN IMPASSE; DIPLOMACY: KISSINGER AND

 With only two weeks until this country's first all-race elections, a private 
business group announced Monday that seven foreign jurists, academics and 
diplomats will arrive today to try to mediate a last-minute solution to a 
constitutional impasse over battle-racked Natal province. 
</P>
<P>
 The group will begin meeting Wednesday with leaders of Nelson Mandela's 
African National Congress, which is expected to win the elections, and Zulu 
Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party, which is seeking to 
delay the elections as part of its militant campaign for greater provincial 
autonomy and an independent Zulu state in Natal. 
</P>
<P>
 The mediation group includes former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and 
A. Leon Higginbotham Jr., a chief judge emeritus of the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court 
of Appeals. A U.S. Embassy spokesman said both men are coming as private 
citizens and not as Clinton Administration envoys. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi first proposed using international mediation in March to bridge his 
dispute with the ANC. But the announcement Monday by the Consultative Business 
Movement, a private group of South African business leaders who have sought 
since the 1980s to foster political change, appeared to catch both the ANC and 
the government by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We received information this afternoon that the mediators would be arriving 
tomorrow," said ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa. He said the mediation will not 
affect the April 26-28 balloting. "Those dates are sacrosanct. They will not 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The government of President Frederik W. de Klerk was also notified Monday, 
said spokesman Richard Carter. He said government officials will meet with the 
group but had not been involved with setting up its mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government's feeling has always been that we were never convinced that 
international involvement could bear much fruit," Carter said. "We have 
consistently believed South Africa's problems should be solved by South 
Africans." 
</P>
<P>
 The call to outside mediators came after an unsuccessful summit last Friday 
attended by Mandela, De Klerk, Buthelezi and the Zulu king, Goodwill 
Zwelithini. The meeting failed to draw the defiant Zulu leaders back into the 
democratic process. 
</P>
<P>
 But foreign diplomats and analysts were skeptical that a sudden attempt at 
international mediation by a group with limited or no experience here will 
succeed where intensive negotiations by South Africans over more than two years 
have failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hocus baloney," said Robert Schrire, a political scientist at the 
University of Cape Town. "I don't think it amounts to much. The issues here are 
not those that lend themselves to mediation." 
</P>
<P>
 Schrire said Buthelezi is using the high-profile mediation to keep himself in 
the world spotlight as South Africa anxiously prepares to elect its first 
post-apartheid government under black majority rule. "The ANC is humoring him," 
Schrire said. "Once they get their landslide victory, they won't have to worry 
about silly things like this. In two weeks, this will all be superseded by 
events." 
</P>
<P>
 A Western diplomat, who has followed the dispute closely, agreed. "I don't 
know what they're going to do when they get here," he said. "I can't see what 
rabbit they're going to pull out of the hat in the next two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 But a South African official said the group might provide a "face-saving 
mechanism" for Buthelezi and the king to accept ANC offers -- under 
international auspices and language. "There may be a positive spinoff," he 
said. "It may be helpful if the king hears that the deal he's being offered is 
a bloody good one." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanne Pfaff, a spokeswoman for the Consultative Business Movement, said the 
group will make recommendations to the ANC and Inkatha in about 10 days. "This 
is mediation, not binding arbitration," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi insists that the five-year interim constitution adopted last 
December is "fatally flawed" because it does not offer enough autonomy, 
especially on issues of taxation and police, to the nine provinces that will be 
created under the new government. 
</P>
<P>
 But Buthelezi walked out of the multi-party constitutional negotiations last 
summer and has refused to participate in the elections. More important, 
national election officials say Buthelezi has obstructed their efforts to 
organize polling in Inkatha-dominated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence between pro-election and anti-election Zulus in Natal has surged to 
record levels since Buthelezi announced his boycott in February. A state of 
emergency that took effect April 1 has had little apparent effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi is chief minister of KwaZulu, a one-party tribal homeland for Zulus 
created under apartheid. His many critics argue that he is using his calls for 
federalism as a front to maintain control that polls show he would lose if he 
joined the race.

PROFILE; REP. SCHUMER PUSHES, PULLS TO MOLD CRIME BILL; BROOKLYN LAWMAKER GAVE 
A LITTLE TO THE LEFT AND A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT IN FORMING THE MEASURE. TO HIM, 
THE MAIN POINT IS THAT IT LIKELY WILL PASS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Although heavy partisan warfare lies ahead, it appears likely Congress will 
give President Clinton a crime bill that will redeem his campaign promises to 
put 100,000 more police officers on the streets and lock up repeat violent 
offenders for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the credit would belong to a pushy pragmatist from Brooklyn who has 
established his credentials as a master in crafting consensus legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 He is Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who holds a crucial post on the House 
Judiciary Committee. Schumer, 43, combines a quick mind with a capacity for 
compromise that has served him well during his seven terms. 
</P>
<P>
 But during consideration of the crime bill, he faced opposition from the left 
and the right for the middle-road approach he advocated. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The public is anguished about crime," Schumer said in an interview. "They are 
telling legislators: 'Do something!' " 
</P>
<P>
 The answer to Schumer seemed obvious -- a combination of punitive measures to 
give hard-core violent criminals life terms and effective measures to deal with 
first-time offenders and drug addicts without putting them behind bars for 
lengthy terms. 
</P>
<P>
 House Democratic leaders wanted a crime bill, too, but one more moderate than 
the Senate bill passed in November with its far-reaching federalization of all 
crimes committed with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 One obstacle was Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Tex.), chairman of the full Judiciary 
Committee, who in the past has expressed skepticism about the need for 
additional crime legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, much of the burden fell on Schumer, chairman of the Judiciary 
subcommittee on crime and criminal justice, where he formed coalitions to get 
the results he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Many liberal Democrats grumbled about provisions of the bill, now pending in 
the House, that expand the federal death penalty to dozens of crimes. Many 
conservative Republicans complained that its sentencing guidelines are too 
lenient and that it shortchanges funds to build prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Schumer, however, had a different goal. As he put it: "We have crafted a bill 
that can pass on the (House) floor." 
</P>
<P>
 With the President's backing, the House seems prepared this week to approve 
almost all the major provisions of a bill that could allow the Democrats to 
nullify traditional GOP attempts to paint them as soft on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to lay the groundwork for adoption of GOP amendments to toughen major 
parts of the bill, Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) has assailed the measure as a 
combination of "tough talk, weak substance and misdirected spending." 
</P>
<P>
 Schumer has made his mark on bills affecting agriculture, banking and foreign 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Schumer who led the uphill fight in the House for the Brady law, which 
restricts handgun purchases, and he has advocated even more far-reaching 
regulation of firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime has formed an angry center, which tells ideologues on left and right: 
Do more with punishment and prevention," Schumer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike its hands-off posture during Senate consideration of the crime bill, 
the Clinton Administration played a greater role as the legislation took shape 
in the House. Prodded by Schumer, the President assigned Ron Klain, a top 
Justice Department official, to be the point man for the crime bill as it moved 
through the Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The House measure includes the popular "three strikes and you're out" 
provision, endorsed by Clinton and previously passed by the Senate, that would 
impose mandatory life terms in federal prison on those convicted of three 
violent crimes, or two violent crimes and one serious drug offense. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans favor that provision. On the other hand, they are grumbling about 
elements that would channel billions of dollars to crime-prone communities for 
unspecified prevention agendas, including midnight basketball programs and the 
opening of schools during the evenings to provide activities for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 For liberal Democrats, however, these provisions worked out with Schumer's aid 
are a sweetener that may allow many of them to swallow some bitter medicine, 
such as the extension of the death penalty to 64 additional crimes -- including 
drive-by shootings and carjackings -- that now come under state and local 
jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those on the left are wringing their hands, but they're going to wind up 
voting for the bill," Schumer predicted. "Those on the right are wringing their 
hands, but I suspect a lot of Republicans will vote for it too."

HEALTH; WHAT STUDENTS DO NOT KNOW IS WHAT COUNTS IN THIS COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEO W. BANKS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marlys Witte is the founder of a unique program in medical education that 
summons future doctors to embrace what they fear most -- ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
 She wants medical students to understand that what is unknown about diseases 
far exceeds what is known, that doctors and medical textbooks are often wrong 
and that the inability of many in the profession to admit these things creates 
an environment in which discovery is stifled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to break down the finality and arrogance that exist in medicine 
in part from a fear of admitting ignorance," says Witte, professor of surgery 
at the University of Arizona Medical School here. "What we don't know is an 
important part of medical education." 
</P>
<P>
 Witte's exploration of ignorance began in 1984. She and philosopher Ann Kerwin 
developed what they call the Curriculum of Medical Ignorance, a series of 
courses, lectures, clinics and research projects that combine a dose of whimsy 
with serious probing into the gaps in medical knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Questions form the core of the curriculum. Students are judged not on finding 
answers, but on the quality of their questions, which they studiously jot down 
in what are called ignorance logs. 
</P>
<P>
 After meetings with patients, students must develop more questions, then 
return to ask patients if they have any questions. Groups of future doctors 
also gather once a month for sessions called Pondering Rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the questions raised at a recent session: Can we ever cure one thing 
without having side effects? Since skin keeps germs out of the body, shouldn't 
it be considered part of the immune system? 
</P>
<P>
 Visiting speakers are brought in to lecture about what they don't know in 
their field of expertise. They're called distinguished ignoramuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The atmosphere is intellectual but loose. Witte and Kerwin sprinkle their 
conversation with references to great poets, philosophers and mathematicians, 
from Socrates to Pascal. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the two professors wear silver pendants and earrings in the form of 
question marks. "We even accessorize ignorance," Kerwin says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ignorance is a paradigm for the 21st Century," Witte says. "The 20th Century 
has been the information and knowledge century. But as our sphere of knowledge 
enlarges, so does our contact with the unknown." 
</P>
<P>
 Kerwin says that questions are more important than answers because knowledge 
is transitory. "Even the dean of the Harvard Medical School tells entering 
freshmen that in 10 years, 50% of what they learn will be proven false," Kerwin 
says. "The problem is we don't know which 50%." 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing that there are no pat answers, the professors say, can lead to hard 
questions -- and breakthroughs. "If we don't know the basic problem in AIDS, 
then maybe AZT isn't the best treatment," Witte says. "If we can ask that 
question, the research and the answers we get will be very different than if we 
can't." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Smart students in a competitive environment are sometimes reluctant to delve 
into what they don't understand. But they come around, often with a sigh of 
relief, upon realizing that the process of learning is always rife with 
mistakes and stumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 Most students say they find the course a welcome respite from the relentless 
memorization and regurgitation of facts, which Witte call academic bulimia. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Joyner, one of Witte's former students who now teaches anesthesiology 
at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, said the program made medical school "more 
than an intellectual death march," consisting of soaking up facts and passing 
tests. "She liberated us from that," Joyner says. 
</P>
<P>
 Witte's formula is that 5% of every medical school class should be devoted to 
questioning what is known and confronting what is unknown, just enough time to 
head off over-confidence and arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
 What's one sign of those dread afflictions? Witte grins and says: "When you 
don't know what's wrong with a patient, give it a Latin name." 
</P>
<P>
 Witte believes the word ignorance scares some in the medical Establishment. 
"But if you can't face the word, you can't face the concept," she says.

CLOUDS HAMPER U.S. PLANES IN ATTACK ON SERB TANKS AT GORAZDE; BALKANS: SOME 
AIRCRAFT FORCED TO HIT ALTERNATIVE TARGETS. ACTION SHOWS DIFFICULTY FACING 
NATO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was in the cloud-enveloped, sunless mountains around Gorazde, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, this past weekend that one of the reasons for the Western 
allies' long reluctance to launch air strikes in the Balkans became crystal 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilots of the two U.S. Marine Corps F/A-18s came in low Monday, according 
to the after-action reports -- but they still could not pinpoint all the 
Bosnian Serb tanks that they had been directed to silence. Instead, they 
destroyed just one tank. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, in similar weather conditions, made worse by the rugged terrain, 
two U.S. Air Force F-16s had been forced to pass up a cluster of tanks and pick 
an alternative target. Their "kill" that day: one Bosnian Serb command tent and 
a few trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Clinton Administration is not emphasizing the point, military 
analysts said the air action in Bosnia already is demonstrating the difficulty 
that North Atlantic Treaty Organization aircraft will have in effectively 
halting a Serbian advance on the town if the Serbs prove intent on continuing 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the cloudless nights and open lines of sight that allowed U.S. 
pilots a field day in the Persian Gulf War, the Balkans are a treacherous 
combination of mountainous terrain and frequent poor weather. And the Serbs are 
scattered, not massed as the Iraqi troops were. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorazde itself is in a valley, almost buried by steep mountains on every side. 
The Drina River runs to the south and east, with the city, like an elongated 
pear, pushing north from the water. There is high ground on the river's 
southern bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the shooting, neither side has tremendous numbers of ground troops 
in the area. The Muslims have about 6,500 soldiers inside Gorazde, supported by 
a handful of tanks. The Serbs have 4,500 men in the area, with larger numbers 
of tanks and artillery. 
</P>
<P>
 It was from high ground that the Bosnian Serb tanks began their shelling 
Sunday. Two of them lobbed shells into the city, guided by fire-control 
observers in a command post on a mountainside about 500 feet above. The air was 
misty, the cloud cover low. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations had sent an 11-man contingent to Gorazde to serve as 
military observers in the area, and the Serbian tank fire was getting too 
close. By midafternoon, the U.N. mission had radioed for close-air support and 
the request had been approved by the chain of command. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At 3 p.m., the two U.S. F/A-18s responded but were unable to pinpoint the 
target, despite two high-speed warning flights. They lost communication with 
their ground controllers. Low on fuel, and with the weather deteriorating by 
the minute, they turned back. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO then sent in two U.S. Air Force F-16s, but they too ran into trouble -- 
partly because of the weather and partly because the British unit that had been 
dispatched to direct the bombing from the ground did not have the necessary 
laser equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Unwilling to let them return to base empty-handed, NATO ordered the F-16 
pilots to attack the command post instead. With a few notable exceptions, the 
Serbs were quiet through the night. 
</P>
<P>
 But Monday, the Serbian barrage resumed, and two more F/A-18s responded to the 
call for help, trying to strike back against tanks and armored personnel 
carriers. But the pilots had difficulty finding targets under the cloud cover. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was unsatisfying. "It's a law of physics," Marine Corps Lt. Gen. 
John Sheehan, operations officer for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters 
later. "Flying in bad weather, regardless of the technology of the machine, is 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Military analysts said that the strategy is a high-risk gamble. If the West 
can persuade the Serbs to press for peace by expending a few bombs to make a 
point, then this past weekend's operations, largely symbolic, will prove 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the Serbs hold firm, the West could be in for a messy, protracted 
affair. "What this tells us is that we're in the deep end of the pool," said a 
former Air Force officer who has been keeping tabs on the operation. "I think 
we're going to lose some airplanes soon."

U.S. WILL IMPOSE TRADE SANCTIONS AGAINST TAIWAN TO PROTECT WILDLIFE; ASIA: BAN 
IS PROMPTED BY THE NATION'S FAILURE TO HALT THE USE OF TIGER AND RHINOCEROS 
PRODUCTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first American trade sanctions aimed at protecting endangered species, 
the Clinton Administration said Monday that it will impose penalties against 
Taiwan for its failure to halt the use of tiger and rhinoceros products. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanctions, the first against Taiwan for any reason, will bar American 
imports of wildlife products from the Asian nation. Their use reflects the 
growing attention being paid to environmental issues in world trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world's tiger and rhinoceros populations remain gravely endangered and 
will likely be extinct in the next two to five years if the trade in their 
parts and products, fueled by market demand in consuming countries, is not 
eliminated," President Clinton said in a letter to Congress on Monday 
announcing the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The import ban affects not just products that use tiger and rhinoceros parts 
but all Taiwanese products made from wild species, including lizard, crocodile 
and snakeskin shoes and coral and mollusk jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 The tiger and rhinoceros parts are believed in Asia to have medicinal and 
aphrodisiac properties and are found in pharmacies there. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the trade sanctions will be prepared by the office of the U.S. 
trade representative. Administration officials said they will cut off about $20 
million in trade with Taiwan, the estimated value of the tiger and rhino parts. 
</P>
<P>
 While the sanctions imposed to protect wildlife are unprecedented, they will 
affect less than 0.1% of Taiwan's exports to the United States, which are 
valued at $25 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing legislation approved in 1978 but never invoked, the Administration 
first warned Taiwan and China a year ago that unless they came up with plans to 
reduce trade in parts cut out of endangered species, the United States would 
invoke sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 While finding that China had made progress, although stronger actions were 
needed, an international committee on endangered species determined that Taiwan 
had failed to meet even minimum requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said China had "consolidated much of its stocks of rhinoceros and 
tiger parts and products," and had "used radio, television, newspaper and 
poster announcements -- as well as burnings of rhino horn and tiger bone -- to 
educate its population on new laws and the need to protect wildlife." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of such progress, import prohibitions on China were not warranted, 
the President said, avoiding exacerbation of the Administration's deep disputes 
with Beijing over human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton had been under pressure from several members of the House and Senate 
to take action against both Taiwan and China. In a March 18 letter to the 
President, 39 lawmakers said China "has been unable to account for over three 
tons of registered rhinoceros horn and apparently allowed the export of over 
one ton of tiger bone to Korea" after a ban on such exports went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. James M. Jeffords (R-Vt.), who led the effort, expressed approval Monday, 
and an aide said the senator agreed that China's progress had been sufficient 
to remove the immediate threat of sanctions. Clinton's decision, Jeffords said, 
"may be the one step necessary to halt the rapid decline in rhinoceros and 
tiger populations and protect them from inevitable extinction." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the measures taken by Clinton will be sufficient remains uncertain, 
because there is considerable economic pressure to keep up the harvest of the 
dwindling supplies. Tiger parts can bring up to $25,000 and crushed rhino horn 
brings varying prices, said Ken Connolly, Jefford's aide specializing in 
environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Connolly said no more than 5,000 tigers remain in Asia -- a decline of 95% in 
the 20th Century -- and three of eight known tiger species are extinct. The 
White House said the rhinoceros population has declined 90% over the past 23 
years, to a present level of 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's action drew praise from environmentalists, who also said 
more pressure is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The African Wildlife Foundation encouraged Clinton to move against others 
trading in rhino and tiger parts, including Hong Kong, North and South Korea 
and Yemen. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel LaBudde of the San Francisco-based Earth Island Institute said the 
sanctions will be "perhaps the most significant event for species protection to 
occur in 20 years." He said that unless China moves effectively, the remaining 
150 to 200 Siberian tigers could be extinct after next winter.

REFORMERS, COMMUNISTS BOTH CLAIM VICTORY IN UKRAINE VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MYCIO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Both reformers and Communists claimed victory Monday in Ukraine's 
parliamentary elections as unofficial returns from weekend runoffs trickled 
into the capital. But with 330 of the legislature's 450 seats filled by two 
weeks of voting, neither the right nor the left had won a clear majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Les Taniuk, a leader of the nationalist, reform-oriented Rukh party, predicted 
that reformers had captured enough seats to make the new Parliament more 
constructive than the last one, which made little progress in shifting the 
country from its Soviet-era ways to modern capitalism. "We see a bloc of up to 
170 lawmakers who will support market reforms," Taniuk said. 
</P>
<P>
 That bloc would include nearly 80 winners from national democratic parties of 
various hues, including 38 from Rukh, as well as a good portion of independent 
candidates. Many other reformers, including market-minded economists such as 
Volodymyr Lanovoy and Victor Pinzenyk, ran and won as independents. 
</P>
<P>
 Reforms here have been largely stymied by resistance from the old Communist 
bureaucracy. That resistance remains among lawmakers from the Communist Party 
of Ukraine, which, together with its socialist and agrarian allies, claimed the 
largest partisan bloc: 114 seats. 
</P>
<P>
 But Taniuk dismissed their importance. "Most of these are old people," he 
said. "I don't think they will have much influence." 
</P>
<P>
 A Western diplomat agreed with Taniuk. "The Communists are more of a regional 
party, and they realize that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Communist victories came mostly from the industrialized eastern region of the 
country, hardest-hit by Ukraine's economic crisis. They are likely to deepen 
the polarization between Ukraine's pro-Russian east and Europe-leaning west. 
"These elections are an accurate reflection of Ukraine's political map at this 
time," the diplomat said.

 Rukh's leader, Vyacheslav Chornovil, predicted that a more basic battle 
confronting the new Parliament will be "the fight over the party of power" -- 
control of the allegiances of the administration officials, industry directors, 
military officers and others who hold real sway. In Soviet times, they were all 
Communist Party members. But their current political party affiliations won't 
become clear until they are tested. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some things in common with these people," Chornovil said. "Especially 
when it comes to preserving our statehood." 
</P>
<P>
 But when it comes to economic reform, other observers predict that at least 
some portions of the ruling cadre may ally with Communist conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 In the elections, the far-right end of the political spectrum did poorly. Only 
three candidates from the paramilitary, super-nationalist Ukrainian National 
Assembly won in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Running at an average of 60%, Sunday's turnout for the 350 races was lower 
than in the first round of elections March 27. But even Crimeans confounded 
their own separatist president, Yuri Meshkov, who called for a boycott of the 
elections, by turning out and filling all 10 seats.

GADFLY IS QUESTIONED IN COLOSIO KILLING; MEXICO: SOCIAL CRITIC DENIES ALLEGED 
TIES TO THE CHIEF SUSPECT. THEY ARE SAID TO BE DISTANTLY RELATED.

 Rodolfo Macias, a gadfly who calls himself this nation's provisional 
president, has finally gotten the government's attention: The special 
prosecutor's office summoned him to appear Monday evening to explain any 
relationship he may have had with Mario Aburto Martinez, the chief suspect in 
the assassination of ruling party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Mexican newspaper reports, Macias and Aburto are distant 
relatives by marriage and Aburto once worked for Macias' brother in Tijuana, 
where Colosio was fatally shot as he left a campaign rally March 23. 
</P>
<P>
 But Macias and Aburto's brother deny any connection between their families. 
Macias said he believes he is being questioned "because (the government) wants 
to confuse public opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 The purported links between Aburto and Macias -- who was last seen in the news 
in 1992 being arrested as he swam across the San Antonio River toward 
then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton -- are one of several seemingly 
far-fetched leads the special prosecutor's office is following up as it 
attempts to solve the murder of Colosio, the man who was widely expected to be 
Mexico's next president. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors persist that drug traffickers planned the killing to destabilize the 
government, even though there is no evidence to back such claims. Further, a 
shadowy group calling itself the Mexican Front Against Government Corruption 
claimed responsibility for Colosio's murder in a call last week to a 
Spanish-language weekly newspaper in Phoenix, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 "Luis Donaldo Colosio was the first target of many that are planned," 
according to a statement from the group. It claims to have 7,000 members, 
including Mexicans working illegally in the United States, Mexican government 
officials, Mexican soldiers and Aburto. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying last week at his own trial, Aburto, who authorities say has 
confessed to killing Colosio, said he acted alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican-American activists in the Phoenix area and Southern California said 
they have never heard of the front. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation about who masterminded the murder has been fed by a seeming 
setback Sunday in the government investigation, when a judge released a key 
figure in the alleged plot to assassinate Colosio. Judge Alejandro Sosa ruled 
there was insufficient evidence to try Rodolfo Rivapalacio, one of the 
organizers of crowd control for the Colosio rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivapalacio was under suspicion because he hired three of the private security 
guards believed to have helped Aburto get close to Colosio and who are now 
being tried as accessories to murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, his alleged connection with Aburto has gained Macias the attention 
that eluded him through six years of protests against the administration of 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Macias founded the Mexicans for Democracy 
Party in December, 1988, when Salinas took office amid charges of election 
fraud. In July, 1989, the group created a "provisional government" and named 
Macias its president. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, in long letters to U.S. and Mexican newspapers and through public 
protests, Macias has tried to draw attention to his claims that the Salinas 
government lacks legitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the brother of the jailed suspect said he has no knowledge of 
a family link between the Aburtos and Rodolfo Macias. And the brother said that 
Marcelino Ortiz, who is married to Aburto's aunt and with whom the murder 
suspect lived in Tijuana, had never said he was related to Macias or otherwise 
mentioned the political gadfly. "I don't know him," Rafael Aburto said when 
asked about Macias. "This is a lie. This guy is an opportunist who wants to be 
famous."

 The Clinton Administration intends to sell Israel up to 25 new F-15I 
fighter-bombers, the first transfer to another country of such a sophisticated 
plane, the Pentagon announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress has the authority to stop the $2.4-billion sale, but backers of the 
arrangement say it will not be blocked.The aircraft will be built by McDonnell 
Douglas Corp., which is based in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel has 51 older-model F-15s, but the newest plane will be capable of 
long-range attack missions and will allow Israel to reach such distant 
potential adversaries as Iran, Iraq and Libya. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has sold F-15s to Saudi Arabia, but they are models that 
lack the sophisticated radar and other systems that will be included in the 
Israeli package.

AS OBSERVER TEAM EXITS HEBRON, CLASH FLARES OVER MARCH; MIDEAST: ISRAELI TROOPS 
FIRE RUBBER BULLETS AT ISLAMIC LEADERS TRYING TO PRAY AT CLOSED SHRINE. 
INTERNATIONAL CONTINGENT WAS 'FACT-FINDING.' 
</P>

<P>
 An advance team from the international force assigned to protect this 
embattled city and its more than 100,000 Palestinians ended its first visit 
Monday moments before Israeli troops clashed with Palestinian Islamic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The troops fired tear gas and rubber bullets to stop the Palestinians, who 
tried to pray in the Cave of the Patriarchs where a Jewish settler massacred 
about 30 Palestinian worshipers Feb. 25. The violence erupted downtown as the 
international observers were on the outskirts of Hebron, wrapping up a 
"fact-finding mission." 
</P>
<P>
 That mission coincided with the first day in seven weeks that Israeli 
authorities had lifted a strict military curfew in the city's center -- a move 
Hebron's new Palestinian mayor called "the gift of the new guests." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the advance team from Norway, Denmark and Italy had expressed 
optimism to a busload of journalists that the unarmed, 160-member international 
force will be able, in about a week, to tackle its "difficult task" of 
restoring normalcy to Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
 Then three Palestinians were injured by rubber bullets Monday and a curfew 
again was clamped on the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't feel secure even with this international force here, because, as you 
can see, Israel won't listen to anybody," shopkeeper Mohammed Rifayieh, 75, 
concluded as tear gas canisters exploded all around his house. It is a few 
hundred yards from the Cave of the Patriarchs, the shrine sacred to Jews and 
Muslims that has been closed to both religions since the February massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of the Palestinian protest march was as deliberate as the visit by 
the observer team. Monday's tour marked the first time that Israel has 
permitted an international observer force into the occupied territories since 
it conquered the areas 27 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 An Israeli government spokesman said the army deliberately scheduled the 
team's visit to end just before the Islamic clerics had scheduled their march 
to begin "so the two wouldn't get mixed up." 
</P>
<P>
 The Islamic leadership that staged Monday's march -- which included protesters 
chanting praise for the armed fundamentalist group that has claimed 
responsibility for a suicide car-bombing that killed seven Israelis last week 
-- declared their effort a victory, even though they never got close to the 
Cave of the Patriarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have shown the world how savage the Israelis are because they prohibited 
us from entering the mosque to pray," declared Sheik Mohammed Saeed Jamal, the 
head of the Higher Islamic Council, after more than a dozen cameras recorded 
him and several hundred marchers worshiping instead in a downtown street. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In Jerusalem, Israeli authorities took a step Monday related to the Feb. 25 
Hebron massacre by Baruch Goldstein, a Brooklyn-born physician from a Jewish 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 A district court imposed a three-month prison sentence on Baruch Marzel, the 
head of the armed Jewish extremist movement Kach, of which Goldstein was a 
member. The judge noted that Marzel had been convicted on charges of "violent 
behavior" 10 times in 14 years and ordered him to serve the term for an old 
offense after his current indefinite period of detention. 
</P>
<P>
 Marzel's arrest -- under an unlimited-detention law in the past applied almost 
exclusively to Palestinian extremists -- was ordered along with six others 
after the massacre. The arrest orders were Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's 
attempt to neutralize threats by Jewish extremists, who oppose Israel's effort 
to forge peace with the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, the Israeli Parliament's finance committee approved the allocation 
of $4.6 million to compensate massacre survivors and families of those killed 
in the mosque; the panel also agreed to provide $1.6 million more to finance 
the commission that has been investigating the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, the commission has heard from, among others, Rabin, who agreed 
to testify only in secret, and Goldstein's widow, Miriam, who told the 
five-member panel headed by the president of the Supreme Court that she had no 
idea her husband was planning the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is still a puzzle; that's the truth. I am continually trying to figure it 
out, but I still haven't found any answer," Miriam Goldstein said, according to 
a transcript released over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 In its sixth week of hearings, the commission also heard from a Muslim guard 
at the mosque who testified that he called out to Israeli soldiers for help at 
the shrine after Goldstein shoved him away and opened fire as he entered. None 
of the Israelis responded, he said. "They heard me but refused," said the 
guard, Mohammed abu Salah.

NEGOTIATORS LOSE HOPE OF MEETING TARGET DATE FOR PALESTINIAN SELF-RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Negotiators here have lost hope of concluding an agreement on Palestinian 
self-rule before a self-imposed Wednesday target date. But they edged on Monday 
toward an accord on civil administration and releasing thousands of Palestinian 
prisoners from Israeli jails. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath said most of the roadblocks that 
emerged in last week's difficult talks have been overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the two sides will probably have to accept that there will be no 
withdrawal this week of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank 
town of Jericho, as was foreseen in the historic Declaration of Principles 
signed last September in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is impossible now to sign the day after tomorrow. There are still many 
things that require finishing," Shaath said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, negotiators said Monday night that they were nearing an accord on 
release of Palestinian prisoners and had reached final agreement on handing 
over 37 of 38 civil administration departments to Palestinian self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 On the issue of water, however, Palestinians still insist on controlling the 
amounts drawn from Jewish settlers' wells. "We have to control all water 
sources in Gaza and Jericho, even if it's inside the settlements," said Jamil 
Tarifi, the Palestinians' chief negotiator on civil affairs. He said a final 
accord on water transfer could be reached as early as today.  
</P>
<P>
 With little or no hope of signing an agreement to begin Israeli troop 
withdrawal by Wednesday's target date, the Palestine Liberation Organization 
has pressed Israel to set a new target date for pulling out. 
</P>
<P>
 PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat was tentatively scheduled to meet Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shimon Peres on Friday in Bucharest, Romania, to try to work out 
remaining problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The schedule for withdrawal has been fully agreed to. The only difficulty 
with it, and it is a very difficult issue, is setting what is called the zero 
day -- the day of signature -- and that day of signature has not yet been 
agreed," Shaath said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to the talks said the two sides will try to agree on a symbolic 
gesture for Wednesday. This could include some symbolic Israeli pullout from a 
point in Gaza or Jericho; the arrival of a small group of Palestinian police 
officers on an organizational trip, or announcement of points upon which the 
two sides have agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres, speaking to reporters in Turkey, said he believes a comprehensive 
accord can still be signed by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 But Peres cautioned that Israel is making no commitment for a new target date, 
saying negotiators "always . . . can encounter some uninvited difficulties, but 
our intention is to conclude it before the end of the month." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaath said an Israeli commitment to begin withdrawing at month's end would be 
acceptable. He estimated the remaining issues will take seven to 10 days to 
conclude. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Early deployment of a small force of Palestinian police has been held up 
because Palestinian military leaders do not want to send a contingent into Gaza 
and Jericho without knowing when the Israelis will begin their withdrawal. They 
fear the suggestion that the new Palestinian officers, rather than being 
symbols of change, will be viewed as cooperating with the Israeli occupation 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides have also disputed how large the early deployment force will be 
after the initial team of eight officers arrives.

BROCCOLI HELPS FIGHT CANCER, RESEARCHERS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Broccoli contains substances that can block or retard formation of breast 
tumors in rats by promoting anti-cancer enzymes, medical researchers at Johns 
Hopkins University report. 
</P>
<P>
 In a study to be published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of 
Sciences today, the scientists said doses of compounds that are found in 
broccoli and in some other vegetables provided cancer protection for a group of 
rats that had been exposed to powerful cancer-causing chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Paul Talalay, a Hopkins researcher who is co-author of the study, said 
Monday that sulforaphane and some related compounds are apparently able to 
amplify the body's own defenses against chemicals that can lead to cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most cancer-causing chemicals are themselves innocuous until they enter cells 
where they are converted to enzymes which are highly reactive and are capable 
of initiating tumor formation," said Talalay. 
</P>
<P>
 Sulforaphane and its chemical cousins, he said, cause the body to produce 
another type of enzyme that blocks the cancer-causing action of the first 
enzyme. 
</P>
<P>
 In the study, Talalay and his colleagues exposed 145 rats to DMBA, a powerful 
cancer-causing chemical. Twenty-five of the rats were used as controls and 
received no drug treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of 50 days, 68% of the control rats had developed mammary tumors, 
but only about 26% of those receiving high doses of sulforaphane developed 
cancer. Similar results were found for a related substance, called compound 2. 
Other related compounds were effective to a lesser degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Talalay emphasized that the vegetable compound seems to work only as a cancer 
preventer and has no effect on tumors that have already started.

RESEARCHERS MAY HAVE KEY TO CANCER CELLS' IMMORTALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Researchers may have discovered why cancer cells are able to reproduce 
endlessly, a finding that could lead to drugs that would attack disease cells 
directly, without harming healthy tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Calvin B. Harley, who directed the research at McMaster University in 
Ontario, Canada, said his group has found in cancer cells an enzyme that 
permits the unlimited replication of new cells. The enzyme is absent in normal 
body cells. 
</P>
<P>
 This suggests, said Harley, that the enzyme, called telomerase, is what allows 
cancer to become "immortal," a laboratory term for the ability of a cell line 
to grow new cells endlessly through the division of old cells. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference Monday, Harley said that normal cells are able to 
reproduce only a finite number of times, limited by the condition of the tip 
end of the chromosomes in a cell. This tip, called the telomere, contains a cap 
of identical genes that protect the rest of the gene structure. It works rather 
like the plastic tip on a shoelace that prevents fraying. 
</P>
<P>
 When cells divide, some of the telomere genes are lost. Since each cell line 
started with only about a thousand of the telomere genes, the number of 
daughter cells that can be produced is limited. When the cell line runs out of 
telomere genes, the cell line dies, a phenomenon called cell senescence. This 
is a strong contributing factor to aging and death. 
</P>
<P>
 Cancer cell lines, however, seem to be able to replicate endlessly and without 
control. The researchers, who are publishing their findings in today's issue of 
the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, said Monday they might be 
just two years away from starting tests of a drug that they hope will block the 
enzyme in human cancer patients. If the hypothetical treatment worked, cancer 
cells would, theoretically, age quickly and die. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the findings are just emerging from the realm of basic science -- no 
animals have been tested -- researchers hailed them as major advances. Dr. 
Huber Warner of the National Institutes of Aging said Harley's study "gives us 
a better understanding of the control of cell doubling and its relevance to 
aging."

RADIATION PROJECT HEAD DEFENDS EXPERIMENTS ON CANCER PATIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pentagon funding of an experimental radiation project had no bearing on the 
quality of treatment given cancer patients, the head of the Cold War project 
told a House subcommittee Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 And its purpose was not solely to provide the Defense Department with 
information on how nuclear warfare could affect soldiers in battle, Dr. Eugene 
Saenger testified in his first public comments since the documents were 
released earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The program involved 88 cancer patients, most of them poor or black, who 
received radiation at Cincinnati General Hospital between 1960 and 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Saenger, a retired University of Cincinnati radiology professor, rebutted 
allegations that his use of whole-body radiation served no medical purpose, as 
families of some patients have alleged. 
</P>
<P>
 "One purpose of the study was the treatment of patients with advanced cancer 
for whom the goal was the relief of pain, shrinkage of cancer and improvement 
of well-being," Saenger told the administrative law subcommittee of the House 
Judiciary Committee, which recommends reparations for people wrongly injured by 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
 "A second purpose was to study the systemic effect of radiation on the 
patient," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics contend tests were conducted to give the Pentagon a simple method to 
determine the extent of radiation exposure received by soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 He said not all patients were told that the Pentagon provided funding but he 
said most clinical studies do not cite a funding source. 
</P>
<P>
 Saenger is among defendants in three class-action lawsuits filed by patients' 
families. They contend that the patients suffered needlessly and that they were 
picked because they were poor, uneducated or black. 
</P>
<P>
 Some family members contend that the radiation shortened the life of patients. 
But Saenger said that the maximum dose given any patient was 200 rads, while 
similar treatment today can be more than 1,000 rads. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, D.C., documents among Energy Department records recently made 
public suggested that human plutonium experiments may have been more widespread 
in the 1940s than previously thought, with more than two dozen patients 
possibly involved. Among other things, the papers showed that six people drank 
plutonium as part of medical tests in 1946.

CLINTON GETS SHORT LIST OF POSSIBLE JUSTICES; JUDICIARY: SEN. MITCHELL STILL

 President Clinton's top advisers presented him with a short list of potential 
Supreme Court candidates Monday as aides continued sounding out reactions to 
the possible appointment of the leading candidate, Senate Majority Leader 
George J. Mitchell (D-Me.). 
</P>
<P>
 Aides said that White House discussions continue to focus on Mitchell. But 
they warned that, as often has happened, the sense of being pushed into making 
a decision before he is ready could prompt the President to push back and look 
harder at other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials said that no decision is likely for at least a couple of 
weeks as aides continue to pore through the records of potential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other possible candidates that White House Chief of Staff Thomas 
(Mack) McLarty, Counsel Lloyd N. Cutler and other top aides discussed with 
Clinton were U.S. District Judge Jose A. Cabranes of Connecticut; U.S. 
Solicitor General Drew S. Days III, a former professor at Yale Law School; and 
federal appeals court judges Amalya Kearse of New York and Richard S. Arnold of 
Arkansas, according to officials familiar with the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Judith Kaye, the chief judge of New York state's highest court 
and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt were also discussed, although Babbitt's 
professed desire to remain at his current job would probably rule him out. 
Federal appeals court judge Stephen Breyer of Boston also is a possibility, 
although his chances appear slight given that he was scratched from 
consideration after being interviewed by Clinton for the previous opening on 
the court. 
</P>
<P>
 As described, the list would appear to meet Clinton's stated objectives of 
racial and gender diversity, with its two women and three minority candidates. 
Cabranes, if named, would be the first Latino nominated for the high court. 
Days and Kearse are black. 
</P>
<P>
 But several officials said that, at least for now, the selection still appears 
likely to develop as Mitchell vs. everybody else. Indeed, one Administration 
official insisted that Mitchell is really the only candidate actively under 
consideration at this point. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's natural they would come back and say there are definitely others," said 
the official, insisting that, in fact, the other names are largely protective 
cover to avoid embarrassment if Clinton decides not to go ahead with Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior White House officials disagreed with that assessment somewhat, calling 
it premature. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "You're about a half-step ahead of where the President is," said one top 
adviser. He said that Clinton is "looking at it a bit in a qualitative way, 
rather than a candidate way" -- thinking about the type of candidate he would 
like and "the import of the decision," rather than focusing on specific names. 
"But those two will likely merge in his mind soon," the adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Clinton does begin to concentrate on the candidates, the adviser added, 
it will be clear that Mitchell's "standing is different than the other 
potential nominees," partly because of his experience outside the judiciary, 
which Clinton prizes, but also because of the particular questions raised by 
considering him for the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Foremost among those questions is whether naming Mitchell would cause too many 
problems politically, given Mitchell's role in handling Clinton Administration 
legislation, a subject on which White House aides continued to take soundings. 
One possibility might be to delay Mitchell's confirmation to allow him to 
complete his work in the Senate on Clinton's health care plan. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, opposition to Mitchell has developed only slowly. Monday, Republican 
Party National Chairman Haley Barbour told reporters at a lunch that Clinton 
should not appoint Mitchell because "to appoint somebody who is a partisan 
politician . . . would be a real setback for the U.S. Supreme Court." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 However, only one Republican senator, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, has voiced 
opposition to Mitchell. Others, most notably Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.), have expressed support for him. White House Press Secretary Dee Dee 
Myers dismissed Barbour's argument, noting that past presidents frequently have 
appointed senators, governors and other political figures to the court. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials are also awaiting an opinion from the Justice 
Department's office of legal counsel on whether appointing Mitchell can be 
squared with the constitutional clause barring appointment of a member of 
Congress to a job for which the salary has been increased during the member's 
term in office. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Ronald Reagan Administration, the legal counsel's office issued an 
opinion saying that such an appointment could not be made, but the department 
took the opposite stand during the Jimmy Carter and Richard Nixon 
administrations. An opinion from Justice Department counsel Walter Dellinger is 
expected later this week.

FLORIDA SUES U.S. FOR COST OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Florida sued the federal government Monday seeking to collect $1.5 billion it 
says the state has spent to provide schooling, health care and prison beds to 
hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people of Florida are saying, "Enough!" to paying an unfair share of the 
cost of providing services to illegal immigrants," said Gov. Lawton Chiles, a 
Democrat running for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 "The federal government should bear the financial responsibility for its 
actions and should pay for the cost of refusing to protect Florida's borders." 
</P>
<P>
 Miami is one of the leading destinations for immigrants from Cuba, Haiti and 
other Latin American and Caribbean nations. 
</P>
<P>
 A report released by Chiles' office last month concluded that Florida paid 
about $2.5 billion in 1993 to meet the basic needs of all immigrants. It 
estimated the state and local governments paid $884 million for services to 
345,000 illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor ticked off a list of costs to Florida taxpayers for services 
provided in 1993 to undocumented immigrants: $180 million for intensive English 
classes; $13 million for health care and $28 million for law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Local governments, as Dade County can attest, spent at least $622 million," 
Chiles said. The state's lawsuit seeks about $1.5 billion because Florida has 
been providing services to illegal aliens for more than a decade, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Named as defendants are the U.S. government; Doris Meissner, commissioner of 
the Immigration and Naturalization Service; Atty. Gen. Janet Reno; Walter 
Cadman, Miami district INS director, and Donna Shalala, secretary of health and 
human services. 
</P>
<P>
 An INS spokesman in Washington declined to comment. "Our response will be 
filed in court," Rick Kenney said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Joining the state of Florida in filing the lawsuit were the Dade County School 
Board, which runs the nation's fourth-largest public school system, and the 
Dade Public Health Trust, which operates Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital, a 
popular destination for sick immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the lawsuit, Chiles said he has been "encouraged by the level of 
cooperation that we've received recently from Washington." He noted last week's 
agreement with the INS to release and deport nonviolent illegal immigrants held 
in Florida prisons. That will free up about 500 prison beds. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates for immigrants in south Florida said they supported the state's 
effort to force the U.S. government to pay a fairer share of the costs of 
illegal immigration. But they warned that immigrants shouldn't be made 
scapegoats for Florida's social ills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a mistake to blame all our problems on immigrants, when, in fact, many 
immigrants here are taxpayers who greatly contribute to our society," said 
Cheryl Little, an attorney for Florida Rural Legal Services.

AIR LOCK MALFUNCTION INJURES 11 AT A-PLANT

<P>
 A gust from an air lock knocked down a group of workers at the Seabrook 
nuclear plant, slightly injuring 11, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident Sunday afternoon occurred when hydraulically operated doors were 
being opened after the plant was shut down for refueling. An air lock is an 
airtight compartment between places that do not have the same air pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Two workers were treated at a hospital for minor injuries, and nine others 
received cuts and bruises, a spokesman said.

 Two Coast Guard cutters Monday were pursuing a 180-foot vessel suspected of 
carrying an undetermined number of illegal Chinese immigrants in waters 240 
miles west-southwest of the international border, federal officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the Coast Guard and the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service were unable to identify the origin or flag of the vessel, named Jin 
Yinn 1, which was spotted Saturday by a C-130 aircraft on routine patrol, Coast 
Guard spokesman Trent Jones said.By Monday, the vessel had turned west and was 
not stopping or answering radio communications, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, an increasing number of Chinese smuggling boats landed along the 
California coast and in Baja California, where illegal immigrants disembarked 
and crossed the border by land. The surge culminated in July, when the Coast 
Guard intercepted three crowded smuggling vessels off the Baja coast, after a 
10-day impasse, turned them over to the Mexican Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 In what Mexican officials described as a humanitarian gesture, Mexico agreed 
to accept and repatriate the 658 Chinese immigrants after the Clinton 
Administration requested help as part of a tough new policy against seagoing 
illegal immigration.

MOST VALLEY FREEWAY QUAKE REPAIRS ON SCHEDULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL BETTNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As all of Los Angeles celebrates the reopening of the Santa Monica Freeway, a 
question arises: Why isn't work progressing as fast on earthquake-damaged roads 
and bridges in the San Fernando Valley? 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't set priorities on (finishing) any of these reconstruction projects 
ahead of others," said Jerry Baxter, Caltrans district director for Los Angeles 
and Ventura counties. "We're just trying to do everything as fast as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Some projects are far more difficult than others and therefore require more 
time, added Jay Steele, a Caltrans project engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparing the Santa Monica Freeway repairs with, say, rebuilding several 
bridges near the interchange of the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways 
"is comparing apples and oranges," said Steele. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, he noted, the Antelope Valley Freeway bridge projects "are 85 
feet in the air and you're also working with detour traffic underneath you all 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had a day off since Sunday, Jan. 30," he said. "We've had an 
average of 160 to 175 people on the site on a daily basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the four bridges at that interchange are to be completed by July 28. 
The remaining bridges at the site -- the southbound Antelope Valley Freeway to 
the northbound Golden State, and the southbound Golden State to the northbound 
Antelope Valley -- are expected to be finished by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Only four of the nine Caltrans contracts awarded for major repairs to local 
roadways after the Jan. 17 Northridge quake have been completed so far: 
</P>
<P>
 * Reopening two lanes of the southbound Antelope Valley Freeway connecting to 
the southbound Golden State Freeway; 
</P>
<P>
 * The Old Road detour around the damaged bridges of the Golden State Freeway 
at Gavin Canyon; 
</P>
<P>
 * The Simi Valley Freeway detour using the former westbound lanes; and 
</P>
<P>
 * The demolition of three main bridges that are part of the Golden 
State-Antelope Valley freeway interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The five remaining projects in the Valley area "are all close to being on 
schedule," said Baxter. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Caltrans may approve an extra week or so of work on two projects 
because engineers at those job sites have run into unforeseen problems, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the projects that may be affected is the rebuilding of Butte Canyon 
Bridge over the Golden State Freeway, north of Calgrove Boulevard and south of 
Valencia Boulevard. Completion of the project is now set for May 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The other is the reconstruction of the Mission-Gothic undercrossing and the 
Bull Creek overcrossing on the Simi Valley Freeway. The scheduled completion 
date for that work is now May 22. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the contracts by Caltrans after the Northridge quake include financial 
bonuses for contractors who finish ahead of schedule and penalties for not 
finishing on time. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the Santa Monica Freeway, that bonus or penalty was $200,000 a 
day. The bonus or penalty for repairs to the Golden State Freeway is $150,000 a 
day, Steele said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bonuses and penalties were determined by the relative "public benefit" of 
completing the repair projects quickly, said Steele. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Freeway, thought to be the world's busiest freeway, "carries 
over 300,000 cars a day," he noted. "On the (Interstate) 5, it's about 135,000 
cars a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter added that the contractor on the Santa Monica Freeway repairs, C. C. 
Myers Inc. of Rancho Cordova, went after the job with unusual vigor. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that Myers hired five times the usual number of carpenters and 
ironworkers used on such a project -- and worked them around the clock, seven 
days a week.

WHITE OFFICER GUILTY IN BLACK CHILD'S SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A suspended white policeman was convicted Monday of a misdemeanor for shooting 
a 6-year-old black child in the knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams Beals Jr., 48, pleaded no contest to negligent assault, and the judge 
then found him guilty.Beals claimed that his gun discharged accidentally as he 
scolded two boys who were throwing rocks into his pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting July 17 stirred racial tensions, and two weeks later someone 
burned down Beals' home. Police have made no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Beals faces up to 60 days in jail and a $500 fine when he is sentenced May 9. 
He had been charged with felonious assault, which carried a maximum sentence of 
18 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Beals, a 25-year police veteran with the suburban community of Oregon, was off 
duty during the shooting. He was suspended from the force with pay, and Police 
Chief Mark Venia recommended that he be fired. An arbitrator will decide the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the boy's family is suing Beals, Oregon and Venia, seeking $4 
million in damages.

2 DEVELOPERS NAME THRIFT IN $100-MILLION SUIT; REAL ESTATE: THE ACTION AGAINST 
FIRST NATIONWIDE FINANCIAL COMES AS ITS OWNER, FORD MOTOR CO., ATTEMPTS TO SELL 
THE SAVINGS AND LOAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two Los Angeles-area home builders have sued First Nationwide Financial Corp., 
alleging that the San Francisco-based savings and loan is attempting to 
sabotage their operations by seizing control of thousands of single-family home 
lots in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court last week and made public 
Monday by Santa Monica-based Paragon Homes and American Beauty Homes of Los 
Angeles, seeks more than $100 million in damages from First Nationwide, a Ford 
Motor Co. subsidiary that is up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 First Nationwide declined to comment on the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford is expected to announce shortly the winning bidder for First Nationwide, 
which has fallen on hard times in recent years. The deadline for final bids was 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the lawsuit could complicate or delay the bidding process, it stands 
little chance of scuttling a sale, analysts said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if a lawsuit turns out to be pretty serious, a buyer can always factor 
its potential liability into the price that it offers, or it can insist that 
the seller assumes any future liability for damages," said Jonathan Gray, an 
S&L analyst for Sanford Bernstein & Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas-based Madison Financial, Oakland-based Golden West Financial Corp. and 
a partnership of Chatsworth-based Great Western Financial Corp. and investment 
giant Lehman Bros. are among those that are believed to have submitted bids for 
First Nationwide. All declined to comment on the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Paragon and American Beauty allege that First Nationwide failed to provide 
promised funding for several housing developments in Los Angeles, Orange, 
Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Bardellini, an attorney for the developers, said Monday that First 
Nationwide has used "similar heavy-handed tactics" to take control of projects 
involving as many as 30 other joint-venture partners around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see a pattern of (First Nationwide) forcing developers out of business," 
Bardellini said. "First Nationwide is taking the prime properties and building 
them out themselves" to make more money. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that First Nationwide wrongfully terminated joint ventures 
with the builders and transferred control of the projects to FN Development 
Co., its home building subsidiary in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The developers maintain that First Nationwide's failure to provide funding for 
their projects will have a "detrimental if not disastrous" effect on their 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the suit, joint ventures involving First Nationwide and the two 
developers generated more than $700 million in sales during the past 20 years. 
American Beauty reported $21 million in sales during 1993 and Paragon reported 
$25 million. Funding Dispute 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica-based Paragon Homes Inc. and Encino-based American Beauty Homes 
allege that First Nationwide, a troubled thrift owned by Ford Motor Co., broke 
its contractual obligation to fund housing developments in Orange, Los Angeles, 
Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties. Paragon's current real estate 
development projects with First Nationwide include:

SOUTHWEST IS FIRST IN AIRLINE QUALITY SURVEY; CONSUMERS: THE DALLAS-BASED 
CARRIER PASSES AMERICAN IN PERFORMANCE RANKINGS. TWA SHOWS THE GREATEST 
IMPROVEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Southwest Airlines surpassed American Airlines to become the No. 1 major 
carrier in overall quality during 1993, according to a study released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not so much that American performed worse," said Brent Bowen, director 
of the Aviation Institute at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. "It's just 
that Southwest performed better." 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest's ranking bodes well for its entrance into Orange County's John 
Wayne Airport, where it will begin operating 17 flights a day starting May 26. 
The arrival has been long awaited because of the carrier's reputation for low 
fares. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest will fly to Oakland and San Jose, with connecting flights to the 
Pacific Northwest. American Airlines already has announced it will match 
Southwest's $69 every-day and $49 discount fares to San Jose, and Alaska 
Airlines is weighing whether to match the same fares to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth annual study, a joint effort between the Nebraska researchers and 
the National Institute for Aviation Research at Wichita State University in 
Kansas, found that total airline quality dropped slightly in 1993 from the year 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though (quality) scores continued a downward trend, they do reflect a 
more stable industry over the past 12 months," said Dean Headley, faculty 
research associate at the Wichita State institute. 
</P>
<P>
 The research ranked nine airlines with annual operating revenue of $1 billion 
or more on 19 factors, including on-time performance, baggage handling, how 
often people are "bumped" from flights, fares and frequent-flier programs. The 
factors are weighted based on customers' comments on what is most important to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest came out on top in baggage handling, on-time performance and 
frequency of low fares, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Southwest is noted by many airline observers as the nation's model air 
carrier," Bowen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas-based Southwest, the nation's seventh-largest carrier in terms of 
passengers, praised its 13,500 employees for the top ranking. The airline 
emphasizes direct flights from smaller airports instead of huge connecting 
hubs, as well as fewer in-flight services and lower fares. 
</P>
<P>
 American, based in nearby Ft. Worth, had been No. 1 for the first three years 
of the study. Spokesman Tim Smith said the airline's mission is different than 
Southwest's. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a significant difference," Smith said. "Our service tends to be 
full-service, long-haul flights that are a little more traditional. I think 
both airlines do a good job." 
</P>
<P>
 United Airlines drew the worst score for mishandled luggage, with an average 
in 1993 of almost 65 mishandled pieces per 10,000 passengers. The researchers 
attributed that in part to United's hub system, which includes busy O'Hare 
International Airport in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 American was tops in having the fewest passengers bumped, while Southwest had 
the worst figure. Headley said that was partly by design and is compensated for 
by the high frequency of available Southwest flights for bumped passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst on-time performance belonged to Delta Air Lines, at 77%. The 
industrywide average is 82%. 
</P>
<P>
 TWA, whose main hub is St. Louis, showed the greatest overall improvement, 
rising to No. 7 from last place in 1992.

CATCHING A PLANE? YOU CAN CATCH A NAP TOO; TRAVEL: FIRM IS TEST-MARKETING SMALL 
ROOMS FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO REST WHILE PASSING THROUGH MINNEAPOLIS. RESPONSE 
HAS BEEN GOOD, OFFICIALS SAY, AND THE IDEA MAY SPREAD. 
</P>

 The business traveler in search of a catnap or a corner for catch-up work may 
soon be able to rent privacy and quiet by the hour at busy airports. 
</P>
<P>
 A Florida company, which since August, 1992, has been testing free-standing 
private rooms at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, says the idea 
has proven a winner and is on the verge of expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are talking to a number of other airports," said Sheryl Andrews, vice 
president for operations at Ziosk Inc., St. Petersburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very happy with the results. The customer response has been excellent. 
We're very excited about it and we have quite a bit of repeat usage," she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Ziosks" being tested in the Minneapolis airport -- eight of them 
scattered throughout the terminals -- are free-standing private rooms, each 
equipped with a sofa, work table, credit card-swipe telephone, fax machine, 
television and clock radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven of the rooms are 7-by-9 feet in size. The eighth is smaller and has a 
recliner chair but no sofa. 
</P>
<P>
 To gain access, the traveler picks up a phone outside the unit. An 800 number 
is automatically dialed, putting the customer in touch with an operator who 
takes down the name, address and credit card number as well as the length of 
time for which the unit is to be reserved. 
</P>
<P>
 The user then gets a four-digit code that allows entry and re-entry through 
the rental period. The cost: $12.95 for the first hour, $6.98 for additional 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, about 2,900 people have used the units at the test site, Andrews said, 
with an average stay of about 90 minutes. Thursday seems to be the busiest day 
of the week, she said, though usage patterns vary by month and location. 
</P>
<P>
 She said one customer in Minneapolis uses a unit there "almost weekly," 
apparently arriving in the early morning on a "red-eye" flight from the West 
Coast and getting in a nap before heading out on business. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who thought up the concept is Jeff Fortune, who, along with his wife, 
operates three resorts in the St. Petersburg area. They formed Ziosk Inc. to 
market the rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews said Fortune devised the concept several years ago, but technology 
made it feasible only recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are all operated remotely," she said. "The only on-site personnel are 
cleaning contractors whom we beep when the renter enters the room, telling them 
the room number and the time when they're due to leave so they can enter and 
clean it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Comments from users have been favorable, she said, with many asking what other 
airports will have the rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 While none of the test locations has running water, the company has a design 
for a room that will have a shower and toilet. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews said the company is the only one testing such a system in the United 
States. A similar concept has been in use at Charles de Gaulle Airport near 
Paris, but that involves a number of units consolidated in one walled-off 
location, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have basically is a private space which can be used either as an 
office away from the office or a private place to take a nap, for both business 
and leisure travelers," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews said the company has not decided yet whether to expand to other 
locations by franchise or by operating the rooms on its own.

INGRAM MICRO CEO INMAN EXITS ABRUPTLY; RESIGNATION: FORMER IBM EXECUTIVE'S 
DEPARTURE WAS PROMPTED BY DIFFERENCES WITH COMPUTER DISTRIBUTION FIRM'S 
CO-CHAIRMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Wanted: One aggressive chief executive to take a $4-billion-a-year computer 
distribution company to $10 billion in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram Micro Inc. is looking for a new CEO after Sam Inman III abruptly 
resigned after nine months on the job as president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 David Dukes, co-chairman of the Santa Ana-based computer distributor, said 
Monday that Inman resigned Thursday evening because of "differences in 
management philosophy" between Inman and Linwood A. (Chip) Lacy, the company's 
co-chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman, a 21-year veteran of IBM, joined Ingram in August, 1993, as president 
and chief operating officer. He was promoted to chief executive in the fall and 
Lacy was scheduled to become president of Ingram's parent company in Nashville, 
Tenn., Ingram Industries Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Lacy will resume day-to-day management of Ingram Micro and will once again 
split Inman's duties with Dukes, who will manage the company's contacts with 
suppliers and customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll continue to live on an airplane," said Dukes, who lives in Orange County 
but was on the road most of last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacy has a reputation as an intense executive who knows the ins and outs of 
computer distribution, a high-stress, ever-changing industry that requires 
constant attention. He is often described in the same breath as both talented 
and intimidating. 
</P>
<P>
 No replacement for Inman is imminent, Dukes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a really big gun we're looking for," he said. "Sam is a bright, 
high-quality individual. But there was a difference in philosophy. It's hard to 
find the kind of person we're looking for." 
</P>
<P>
 Lacy and Inman weren't available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In a given day, Ingram Micro will receive $15 million in orders from computer 
dealers in transactions that average $1,200 each. The company distributes 
everything from $20 video games to $25,000 computer workstations -- souped up 
computers for engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other executives left Ingram Micro in the past week, but Dukes said the 
departures were unrelated. Andy Rich left his post as vice president of human 
resources, and Bruce Martin, senior vice president of purchasing, left to take 
a job at computer reseller Intelligent Electronics.

SBA'S 8 (A) PROGRAM DRAWS FIRE; COMPETITION: A HIGH FAILURE RATE IS CITED FOR 
MINORITY ENTREPRENEUR GRADUATES. BUT SANTA ANA SOFTWARE DESIGNER INFOTECH 
DEVELOPMENT IS A LOCAL SUCCESS STORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Florence Alexander started her management consultant firm in the basement of 
her home, equipped with a typewriter and a dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Success came quickly after she joined the Small Business Administration's 8(a) 
program, the government's flagship effort to develop minority entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Her company's first federal contract, for $1,000 in 1988, set it on a path 
that led to a $233-million contract to work on the Justice Department's asset 
forfeiture program. 
</P>
<P>
 At its peak, Ebon Research employed 1,450 people at 350 sites nationwide, 
nearly all in minority neighborhoods. Alexander's workers processed data, 
analyzed information, cared for laboratory animals and monitored safety at 
government work sites. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fall came swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
 The company graduated from the SBA program in 1990 and, without the edge given 
to minority contractors, lost the Justice Department business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was such a devastating loss to me," Alexander said. "I'm struggling to 
stay alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Ebon Research has laid off two-thirds of its workers and 90% of its 
management. Alexander is suing the Justice Department to get the contract back. 
</P>
<P>
 Her story is common, according to the SBA. 
</P>
<P>
 An agency study shows 46% of the companies that graduated from the 8(a) 
program from October, 1989, to September, 1992, went out of business or cut 
back their operations substantially. 
</P>
<P>
 Parren Mitchell, a former Maryland congressman who chaired the House Small 
Business Committee in the mid-1980s, said the program's record reflects the 
high failure rate of small businesses generally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once they were out of the 8(a) program and tried to compete in the private 
sector, they ran into difficulties -- the old-boy network and all of that 
stuff," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 70 Orange County businesses currently are involved in the SBA program. 
One of the program's most successful local graduates is Infotech Development 
Inc., a software designer in Santa Ana. During its 10 years in the program, 
from 1980 through 1990, the company racked up more than $344 million in 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Alexander's firm, Infotech continued to thrive after leaving the 
program. Last year it brought in $136 million in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program helps you get projects under your belt so that when you go to a 
potential client who isn't restricted (to program participants), you have 
something to show them," said Jim Cradduck, senior vice president for corporate 
development at Infotech. "It allows you to hone your competitive skills." 
</P>
<P>
 As graduation day neared, Infotech began focusing on diversifying its client 
base. "We looked into different federal agencies and started doing commercial 
work," Cradduck said. "Every program has its problems, and not every company 
that graduates (from the 8(a) program) succeeds. But it really helped us." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander, on the other hand, feels that the SBA program failed to prepare her 
company for real-world business competition, "all of the things you're 
sheltered from in the 8(a) program." 
</P>
<P>
 Graduates who survive warn that relying solely on SBA business can harm a 
company's prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't wait for SBA to knock on the door," said Bob Tucker, owner of a 
Louisiana high-tech counseling firm that left the program last year and 
continues to prosper. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gone through little doorways, big doorways and no doorways at all to 
effectively market ourselves. We have been able to effectively compete," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with mounting criticism, the SBA is working to make changes, said 
Cassandra Pulley, the deputy administrator who is drafting the reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program has over time become almost exclusively focused on government 
contracting," Pulley said. "And we're trying to provide additional assistance 
to program participants in terms of the technical and managerial skills that 
the company develops." 
</P>
<P>
 The SBA is set to announce a joint effort with NationsBank this week to expand 
information centers that provide small businesses with specialized education 
and technical assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8(a) program has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional investigators concluded recently that the SBA is failing to meet 
some program requirements set by law. The General Accounting Office reported 
last year that the SBA: 
</P>
<P>
 * On average takes 117 days to process an application to join the 8(a) 
program, nearly a month longer than the maximum set by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 * Needs to do a better job reviewing each participant's business plan to 
ensure it remains realistic, another legal requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 * Was five years behind in installing a new management information system that 
would allow the agency and Congress to better assess the program's 
effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 The Associated Press reported Monday that its computerized study of six years 
worth of 8(a) contracts found the lion's share of business from the minority 
set-aside program went to companies in white, well-to-do areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The AP also found that companies in the program that remain in minority 
neighborhoods get fewer contracts and dollars on average than those in white 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Commission on Minority Business Development, in a 1992 report, 
concluded nothing could be done to fix the current system and urged that the 
program be transferred to a new agency within the Commerce Department.

BRIEFCASE: TECHNOLOGY; GATEWAY TERMINATES STOCK MAJORITY SALE PLANS WITH CONRAC 
</P>

<P>
 Gateway Communications Inc., an Irvine computer network company, has 
terminated a deal to sell a majority interest to Conrac Technology Corp. in 
Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies gave no explanation for why the deal fell apart, though Gateway 
noted that Conrac reduced its offer from 95 cents a share to 88 cents a share 
after final negotiations began. 
</P>
<P>
 Gateway announced three weeks ago that Conrac, a maker of high-resolution 
computer monitors and other electronics equipment, would invest $5.9 million 
for a 55% stake in Gateway. 
</P>
<P>
 Ali Hussain, chief executive of Conrac, and Patrick F. Cadigan, chairman of 
Gateway, declined comment. At the time of the deal, Cadigan said in a statement 
that the Conrac investment would revitalize Gateway, which reported a loss last 
year of $2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Gateway's revenue fell to $10.4 million from $20.8 million last year as the 
company shifted its product line from making network adapter equipment -- a 
market that was flooded -- to creating remote access equipment for computers 
throughout a company. 
</P>
<P>
 Remote access equipment sales have been growing because of a trend toward home 
offices and mobile computing, in which people often connect to company 
computers over the phone lines.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: WORKERS' SUIT SAYS HUGHES HID TOXIC EXPOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six current and former employees of Hughes Aircraft Co. have filed a lawsuit 
against the aerospace company, claiming it concealed the presence of airborne 
toxic substances at the company's Fullerton facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs allege that exposure to the substances caused headaches, 
pneumonia and chronic laryngitis. According to the suit, they worked together 
as buyers for Hughes in an office that shared a building with a department that 
manufactured circuit boards. They first complained of respiratory problems in 
January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Hughes declined comment on the lawsuit.

 New AST Outlet: AST Research Inc., the nation's fourth-largest computer maker, 
said its computers will be sold in CompUSA outlets, the nation's largest 
computer superstore chain with 72 stores and nearly $2 billion in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal could give a significant boost to Irvine-based AST's revenues since 
computer superstores like Dallas-based CompUSA are expected to capture as much 
as 22% of the computer product sales market by 1996, based on estimates by 
market researcher Merrin Information Services in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 "The superstore category for us is one of the fastest growing sales channels," 
said Jim Schraith, AST's senior vice president of worldwide sales and service. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer superstores, which sell high volumes of computer products at discount 
prices in warehouse-like stores, have grown dramatically in the past five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 AST also said it will open an office in Moscow as part of a push to sell 
personal computers to the newly opened markets of the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 AST said Robert N. McFarland, AST's director of international business 
development, will head the AST sales and support team.

 Big O Tires: Investor Kenneth W. Pavia has protested the way the company plans 
to include his proposal in its upcoming proxy statement.As previously reported, 
Big O, based in Englewood, Colo., agreed last month to include a proposal from 
Pavia recommending that the board hire an investment banker to explore all 
alternatives to enhance the value of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavia, who owns 9.6% of Big O's stock through Balboa Investment Group, said 
that Big O informed him it would treat abstentions and other non-votes as votes 
against the proposal. Pavia wants non-votes ignored in tabulating the results. 
Big O officials could not be reached Monday for comment.

WORLD CUP MAY COMPLICATE LIVES OF VACATIONERS

 A warning for business travelers: If you need a hotel room in Boston, New 
York, Washington or San Francisco in the next four months, book it now. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup -- soccer's quadrennial global extravaganza -- is coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Diener, president of Dallas-based Hotel Reservations Network, said the Cup 
games on top of the usual spring and early summer travel activity threaten to 
make hotel rooms in those four cities particularly scarce and expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Diener's company is the nation's largest booker of discount hotel rooms, last 
year handling 300,000 room nights in 20 major U.S. cities as well as London and 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Cup will be played out in nine U.S. cities over the course of a 
month beginning June 17, with the opening match in Chicago, the four cities 
Diener mentioned are particularly tight, in part because they are already 
popular tourist venues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boston is very tight," he said. "It's about half sold out for the month of 
April and it will be totally sold out much of May, June, July and August." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cup crunch will be big in New York, Washington and San Francisco as well 
as Boston, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other Cup cities -- Orlando, Detroit, Dallas, Chicago and Los Angeles -- 
will not be as much affected, Diener said. The hotel business in Los Angeles, 
for example, is still suffering the economic aftershocks of the deadly 
Northridge earthquake in January.
