THE GREAT ESCAPER; WHAT'S THE FASCINATION WITH MAGICIANS LIKE HOUDINI? IF THEY 
CHEAT DEATH, MAYBE WE CAN, TOO; THE LIFE AND MANY DEATHS OF HARRY HOUDINI, BY

<TEXT>
<P>
 When I was a child I developed a brief but passionate interest in two shamanic 
figures, Houdini and Rasputin. In my mind they seemed two sides of the same 
coin, the Mad Monk a dark, primeval figure shambling out of the great Siberian 
wastes, Houdini the mysteriously cheerful prankster, more daemon than demon, 
first cousin to Chaplin's malignly chirpy tramp. I can date this interest from 
the Tony Curtis movie based on Houdini's life, which was made in 1952. That 
means I was 7, and had probably just come to a realization of the reality of 
death. And death, of course, minatory and ineluctable, was at the core of the 
fascination of both Harry Houdini and Gregory Rasputin, not only for me but for 
many millions of people -- including, incidentally, Alexandra, Empress of All 
the Russias, who was a fan of both performers. 
</P>
<P>
 The mage who subjects himself to ritual death only to rise again from the 
grave is a figure as old as humankind. He is the sacrificial victim we push 
ahead of us into the maw of approaching annihilation. Somebody, we say, 
somebody has got to be able to defeat death on our behalf, if only by trickery. 
Rasputin had to be poisoned, shot in the skull and back, kicked in the head and 
then shoved under the ice of the frozen river Neva, before he gave up the 
ghost; and, seeing that he could survive so much, who would say for certain he 
was really dead? Houdini too, late in his career, went under a frozen river, 
but discovered he could save himself by breathing the shallow air-gap between 
the ice and the surface of the water. 
</P>
<P>
 The Empress Alexandra, were she still living, would have been impressed. When 
she met Houdini, during his tour of Russia in 1903, she refused to believe that 
his tricks were worked by sleight-of-hand and not magic. She was not alone in 
this refusal; Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, that exemplary Victorian, would have none 
of Houdini's sensible denials: "It is said, 'How absurd for Doyle to attribute 
possible psychic powers to a man who himself denies them!' Is it not perfectly 
evident that if he did not deny them his occupation would have been gone 
forever? What would his brother magicians have to say to a man who admitted 
that half his tricks were done by what they would regard as illicit powers? It 
would be exit Houdini." Dear me, how Holmes' lip would have curled! 
</P>
<P>
 What the Empress and the writer were expressing was the need that millions 
felt, and will always feel, for evidence that there is something beyond this 
world with its pains and paltry effects, some occult region where dwell the 
peaceful dead, and where certain charmed beings may go to learn the arcana of 
the departed and return with something of their power. As Ruth Brandon has it, 
in her splendid and immensely intelligent biography, "The Life and Many Deaths 
of Harry Houdini," shamans derive from the extremity of their experience a 
knowledge denied to most other people. They have journeyed from horror and 
madness through countless dangers to rebirth and joy. They are healers, 
psychologists, repositories of ancient wisdom; they are feared and honored; 
they are outside society. They operate through performance -- elaborate 
dramatic ceremonies during which they not only speak with spirits in their own 
languages, but become them. A shaman performs miraculous feats. In his own 
body, he descends to the underworld and returns unharmed. Siberian shamans 
enact this by diving through a hole in the ice and then resurfacing through it: 
a scene with which Houdini enthusiasts will be familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 Houdini, it must be said, was a most unlikely figure to fill the role of 
shaman. He was born Ehrich Weiss in 1874, probably in Budapest, though he 
claimed his place of birth was Appleton, Wis., to which unlikely spot the 
family had moved to escape the rabid and highly dangerous anti-Semitism of 
Hungary. He was one of five boys, the son of Samuel Weiss, a self-styled rabbi, 
and the formidable Cecilia Steiner, the woman who was probably the one real 
love of Houdini's life. The family's history is lost in a fog of legend, much 
of it generated by Houdini and his younger brother Theodore, also a magician. 
As Ruth Brandon says, Houdini's life, "which he never ceased to invent, was a 
gothic fiction, and the beginning of the story had to fit its continuation." 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon is a shrewd and incisive biographer (probably a better one than 
Houdini merits), and the early chapters of her book are superb. She points out 
the "parallel between the unpredictable and (to the audience) mysterious world 
of magic and that of the poor immigrant, set down in a strange country." Where 
the immigrant came from he understood how things worked, even if they usually 
worked against him; in the new world there is "a more or less total 
disorientation: a state in which the immigrant is at the mercy of every shark 
or petty official who chooses to impose upon him. Luck is the only logic." The 
Weiss family, living a hand-to-mouth existence, moved to Milwaukee, where, when 
Houdini was 12, his father died, having first made young Ehrich promise to take 
care of his mother for as long as she lived. The death-bed injunction would be 
carried out with an enthusiasm, and a success, that would have astonished the 
father. 
</P>
<P>
 The other woman (I choose the term deliberately) in Houdini's life was his 
wife Bess, whom he met when he was 20 and she, 16. Here is Houdini's account of 
the wooing: "One day I was hired to give an exhibition at a children's party in 
Brooklyn. At the close a little girl, about 16, said to me very bashfully, 'I 
think you are awfully clever,' and then, with a blush, 'I like you.' 'How much 
do you like me?' I said, 'Enough to marry me?' We had never seen each other 
before. She nodded. And so, after talking the matter over, we were married." 
Theirs was an extremely odd marriage (Brandon speculates that it was 
unconsummated). At the very start Houdini hoisted Bess on to a pedestal from 
which she was not allowed to step down until Houdini's death 32 years later. 
For all the oddity, however, they were devoted to each other, and Houdini, who 
found it hard to conceive of the reality of anyone's existence other than his 
own, does seem genuinely to have loved his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Houdini began his stage career in medicine shows and vaudeville, at the start 
in partnership with Bess; he worked later, and more naturally, as a soloist. 
His first specialty was escaping from handcuffs, a trick for which audiences 
had a surprising appetite. Later he developed more and more elaborate escape 
tricks. The world was mesmerized. Soon he was traveling all over America and 
Europe, earning thousands of dollars a week. His energy was boundless, his will 
seemingly unbreakable. He was a man obsessed. 
</P>
<P>
 His main obsession was death. As Ruth Brandon puts it, "what Houdini was 
pursuing was proof of his own immortality." Again and again he put himself in 
mortal peril, whether strapped into strait-jackets and thrown into frozen 
rivers, or locked in a coffin and submerged in a tank of water. More than once 
he came close to perishing. "Not that he did not fear death. The opposite was 
true. He was so haunted by it, the consciousness of it filled his thoughts so 
entirely, that his life was tolerable only if he could assure himself, time 
after time, that he could defeat it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, however, exhausted perhaps by the lifelong struggle to escape what 
in his heart he most desired, he embraced death, continuing his stage 
performance for days while suffering from a ruptured appendix. He died of 
peritonitis at the age of 52. Bess, bereft and helpless without him, sought for 
years to summon up his spirit, with the help of numerous and mostly fraudulent 
mediums. The grave, however, remained silent. 
</P>
<P>
 As I read Ruth Brandon's account of this singular life I kept having a sense 
of almost-recognition. What was it that was missing from Houdini's life and 
work? At last it came to me: art. He had all the characteristics of an artist 
of genius -- obsession, perfectionism, fierce will-power, a highly developed 
self-consciousness, patience, attention of detail, a longing for immortality -- 
yet his mind and deeds were irredeemably banal. But then, banality of spirit is 
the chief characteristic of the shaman. Art is dangerous; magic is not.

TRUST ME ON THIS; DEAD, AND YET MELANCHOLY; THIS DECEASED WRITER DID NOT WRITE,

 "I am astonished that a writer of such greatness does not yet occupy the place 
he deserves."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Susan Sontag 
</P>
<P>
 It is now autumn, and the images of Brazil's World Cup team have almost faded. 
Before they evaporate completely, I would like to propose a modest celebration 
for another of Brazil's glories, the novel "Epitaph of a Small Winner" by 
Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, I have pressed this disarming novel on friends for years, ever since 
I found a copy at a used-book sale in San Francisco two decades ago. The books 
were already pre-packed in four-pound lots (25 a pound). For $2 I received a 
copy of "Epitaph" as well as another of Machado's masterpieces, "Dom Casmurro," 
along with several books I thought I wanted at the time but cannot remember at 
all now. So much for literary "discoveries." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then the readers I have known who are passionate about Machado are 
Brazilian friends (well, of course), academics, various publishers (yes, some 
of them actually do read), and a few writers, such as Susan Sontag (whose 
statement quoted above first appeared in an article in "The New Yorker" and 
then, in a slightly different form, in a new edition of the book issued in 
1992). But the general reader, if there is such a thing any more, seems to need 
a little encouragement, not to say indoctrination, to pick up a book first 
published in 1880 that has been compared to Laurence Sterne's "Tristram 
Shandy," to the works of Flaubert, Hardy and Henry James, of Italo Svevo, 
Beckett and Swift. All of this is very fine, but it leaves too heavy an 
impression of the lecture hall or Cliff Notes, whereas it is essential to 
emphasize how original, how engaging this 209-page novel, divided into 160 
chapters, really is. 
</P>
<P>
 So, finally, what is all the excitement about? Well, not a performance by 
Romario, Barbeto, Dunga & Co., you understand. But something equally 
fleet-footed, dazzling. First there is the unexpected, darkly funny premise. As 
the narrator, one Braz Cubas, explains in Chapter 1, this is a book written by 
a dead man, "a writer for whom the grave was really a new cradle." A "Tristram 
Shandy" in reverse. And who is this Braz Cubas and why should he concern us? 
First, he was born in colonial Brazil early in the 19th Century into a 
prominent family and an environment characterized by "vulgarity of character, 
love of loudness and ostentation, weakness of will, domination by whim and 
caprice and the like." He grew, he tells us, into a handsome, wealthy, stylish, 
harebrained playboy, whose life did not, despite early promise, opportunities 
and one great love, come to anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Easy to call this irony. Even pessimism. (This is probably why his translator, 
William Grossman, suggested that Machado is "perhaps the most completely 
disenchanted writer in occidental literature.") Certainly Braz speaks of the 
yellow flower of melancholy and the voluptuousness of misery. And his friend 
Quincas Borba conceives of a crackpot Philosophy of Misery. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is pessimism with a smile, the aura of gloom dispelled by Braz's 
story and the manner in which he tells it. Looking backward from the grave, 
proceeding from his birth by digression, by incessant, self-deprecating asides 
to the reader, by finding connections and general principles where no one else 
might, Braz charms, captivates, pulls us along by the persistence of his 
various obsessions. What will the fellow think of next? one wonders. 
</P>
<P>
 If, for example, Tristram Shandy has his hobbyhorse, which he eagerly rides, 
Braz has a "trapeze that I used to carry about in my head." There ideas take 
hold, after "flexing their arms and legs," and perform "the most daring 
acrobatic feats one can possibly imagine." One of these ideas concerns the 
invention of "a great cure, an anti-melancholy plaster, designed to relieve the 
despondency of mankind." 
</P>
<P>
 Braz will eagerly point out, in Chapter 71, the great defect of this book he 
is writing: the reader. "You want to live fast, to get to the end, and the book 
ambles along slowly; you like straight, solid narrative and a smooth style, but 
this book and my style are like a pair of drunks: They stagger to the right and 
to the left, they start and they stop, they mutter, they roar, they guffaw, 
they threaten the sky, they slip and fall." At one point he discovers he's just 
written an unnecessary chapter. At another, he is so impressed with one of his 
own pseudo-profound thoughts that he exclaims "Blessed be the Lord, what an 
impressive closing for a chapter!" 
</P>
<P>
 So, a self-absorbed eccentric, a quirky, fallible narrator, who does, in his 
final chapter, get the last laugh, thus revealing the meaning of the title of 
his posthumous memoirs and providing us with an elixir of a very special kind. 
After all is said and done, the hindsight of the grave is good for something. 
</P>
<P>
 And who was the creator of the melancholic Braz? Joaquim Maria Machado de 
Assis (1839-1908) was born in Rio de Janeiro, the son of a freed slave and a 
Portuguese washerwoman. He was a rickety, epileptic child who, after the death 
of his mother and later his father was raised by his stepmother. He decided 
early on to be a writer, and despite a lack of formal education, did so, 
working first as a typesetter, proofreader and a journalist. He published his 
first book of stories in 1869; this was followed over the next decade by 
several very successful novels of manners set in the upper rungs of Brazilian 
society. Then in 1879, dissatisfied with the limits of his own work and with 
what he saw elsewhere and suffering a variety of ailments, he retreated to a 
health resort for three months. When he returned, he began "Epitaph of a Small 
Winner," which began to appear in newspapers in 1880 and confirmed his 
reputation as Brazil's leading man of letters. Other works followed, including 
"Philosopher or Dog?," which recounts the eccentric legacy of Braz Cubas' 
friend, Quincas Borba, and "Dom Casmurro," the fictional memoirs of a 
self-styled morose, tight-lipped man and the tragic jealousy that ruined his 
life. Thomas Colchie, the translator and biographer of Jorge Amado, has written 
that with these works Machado "mined (and undermined) the realistic novel in as 
ambiguous, complex, and enduring a fashion as that of his North American 
contemporary, Henry James." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Brazilian Academy of Letters was founded in 1897, Machado was elected 
president and was perpetually re-elected. When he died in 1908, the Brazilian 
Chamber of Deputies, in a special session, voted a state funeral with civil and 
military honors, an unprecedented tribute. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, you may ask, did such a masterpiece and such an author go unknown for so 
long? In English, anyway, since that is what we are really talking about here. 
One has to assume that Machado's being Brazilian was a major handicap. (Not 
even the Spanish-speaking and -reading part of South America seems to be much 
acquainted with his works.) But, fortunately, in the early 1950s an American 
economist living in Brazil undertook the translation of Machado. This is the 
aforementioned William Grossman, who deserves full credit for a sprightly and 
splendid translation that has been in print for over 40 years now. Credit 
should go as well to the Noonday Press, a division of Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 
which had the wisdom or, something just as important, the luck, to publish the 
book and keep it in print all these years. 
</P>
<P>
 Goal!, as they were heard to say in Pasadena (and elsewhere) recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Epitaph of a Small Winner," translated by William L. Grossman with a foreword 
by Susan Sontag, is available in paperback from Noonday Press. Other books by 
Machado de Assis (published in paperback by Noonday): "Dom Casmurro," 
translated by Helen Caldwell with a foreword by Elizabeth Hardwick, and 
"Philosopher or Dog?" translated by Clotilde Wilson.  
</P>
<P>
 "Trust Me on This" is an occasional feature in which writers make a case for 
that forgotten, obscure or unsung book that they put in everyone's hands with 
the words: "Read this. You'll love it. Trust me on this."

PLUCK, LUCK AND DESTINY; ALICE MUNRO'S SHORT STORY CHARACTERS LIVE ON IN THE 
MIND LONG AFTER THE TALE HAS BEEN TOLD; OPEN SECRETS, BY ALICE MUNRO (ALFRED A. 
KNOPF: $23; 294 PP.)

<TEXT>
<P>
 Long after her books end, Alice Munro's characters live on in the mind like 
cranky, cheek-pinching relatives from childhood. Once you've read her, you 
can't forget Flo from the 1977 story collection, "The Beggar Maid" -- stubborn, 
fiercely proud, with her work-scuffed knees, flowered aprons and penchant for 
warning people to "get out of my road"? Then there's Addie Jordan, a.k.a. 
Princess Ida, from "Lives of Girls and Women" (1971), dashing around the 
Canadian hinterlands trying to sell encyclopedias to poor farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 In Munro's stunning new collection, "Open Secrets," one woman describes 
another as "not the easiest in the world, but you can't help admiring her." She 
might be talking about the book's entire cast. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent, impulsive, longing for comfort and ritual but drawn to danger, 
they dump husbands, boyfriends and small-time lives on whims. Whatever regrets 
they have, they're proud of their own gumption. However low they feel, they 
heed their own preposterous visions (as when Jesus visits one scrappy polio 
victim in her iron lung and scolds, "You've got to get back up to bat, Mary"). 
</P>
<P>
 What they share is a particularly well-developed sense of how pluck and luck 
join forces to shape destiny. Lucky accidents are a recurrent theme in Munro's 
stories, especially for penniless, provincial girls from towns like Carstairs, 
Ontario, the scene of many tales in the new book. Salvation from a life of 
drudgery may come in the form of a wealthy man or an exotic trip or simply a 
job in another town. But more important than any opportunity are the guts to 
seize it, to engage in a search for meaning instead of settling for, as one 
Munro character puts it, "flimsy choices, arbitrary days." 
</P>
<P>
 Extremely helpful to the search is imagination, another quality the 
beleaguered women of the Canadian outback have in spades. Their capacity for 
envisioning other lives comes largely from their habit of storytelling, which 
is as central to their survival as breathing. Over coffee, over drinks, in 
shops, kitchens and hospital rooms, person to person and via letter, their 
tale-telling draws them close and helps them understand their lot. As they air 
their own and their neighbors' "secrets," they diffuse the horrors of a rough 
existence and inspire each other with fresh hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Munro's narrative strategy is built on the gathering force of multiple stories 
-- tales told and retold in different voices, anecdotes offered in the context 
of others. In "The Albanian Virgin," a "movie plot" recounted to the story's 
narrator by a restless, bedridden woman turns out to be a version of the 
woman's own colorful history, which, in turn, plays against the unresolved 
drama of the narrator's life. "A Wilderness Station" tells a tale of fratricide 
that is passed through generations of a family via news accounts, letters and 
repeated tellings until it loses its sting and is remembered as an "accident." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, Munro's tale-tellers report facts: the antics of a wayward spouse; 
an overheard conversation; the last sighting of a lost girl. Often, they relate 
mysteries and merely hold them up for an audience to consider. The story 
"Carried Away," for example, asks the question: Why would a soldier already 
engaged to a girl back home start a mail-order romance with a woman he's never 
met? Why, after the war ends, would he not contact the woman again but instead 
haunt her workplace surreptitiously for the rest of his life? 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows what really happened?" a father writes to his daughter late in 
Munro's book. Does it matter? he might add. 
</P>
<P>
 Munro's stories show "truth" to be a shifting, subjective thing. But since a 
tale is always anchored by a teller's feelings and perceptions, any yarn 
contains a bit of truth. Over the course of "Open Secrets," these bits add up. 
Layers of secrecy and deception are pulled away, revealing more and more about 
people and their community -- and the conflicts between the two. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual and communal needs are often at war in Munro's fiction, where small 
towns are variously seen as prisons and shelters of the human spirit. Carstairs 
is no exception. There, doctors' wives lord it over farmers' wives, and the 
Douds, who own the factory, are second only to God. Still, those who've bolted 
return with lumps in their throats, bemoaning changes in the place they still 
regard as home. 
</P>
<P>
 As always, Munro captures the exact pitch of this tiny world -- its solidity 
and its oppressiveness, its local heroes and its characters. Opening one of her 
stories is like dropping in on a country kitchen jammed with people who know 
each other. The reminiscences fly thick and fast, leaping decades, switching 
speakers; it takes a while to get your bearings. When the tale ends, it's hard 
to let it go, and return to a world where stories matter so much less.

A DYSFUNCTIONAL DRAC; LATEST REINCARNATION OF THE COUNT IS NOT OUT OF THIS

RODERICK ANSCOMBE (HYPERION: $22.95; 409 PP.)

By Patrick McGrath, Patrick McGrath's new novel Asylum will be published next 
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The vampire is a fascinating creature. For hundreds of years it has haunted 
the human imagination, bringing plague and a hideous sort of living death to 
its victims. It is both terrifying and seductive, speaking to fantasies of 
sexual surrender, to unconscious desires to offer one's body to a strong 
predatory figure that can melt all resistance with the sheer passion of its 
need. 
</P>
<P>
 For a creature capable of inspiring such universal dread, the vampire's 
origins are surprisingly humble. For in its first appearance, in Central 
European folklore, the vampire is not a suave gent in a flowing cloak but a 
plump Slavic peasant in a dirty linen shroud, with long fingernails, stubbly 
beard, ruddy, swollen face and its left eye wide open. Its appearance is 
thought to be rooted in medieval burial practices and certain peculiarities of 
human decomposition. Corpses that bloat, and bleed from the mouth, and poke 
their fingers up through the earth, tend to give the impression of being alive. 
From such phenomena powerful myths arise, especially when they're associated 
with outbreaks of disease in the community and depredations of livestock. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest version of the life and times of a Transylvanian vampire comes in 
Roderick Anscombe's novel, "The Secret Life of Laszlo, Count Dracula." What's 
unusual about this book is that no supernatural effects are used. This Dracula 
is all too human, and it's to his psychology we must look to explain why he 
attacks lovely young women and opens their throats and drinks their blood while 
raping them. This Dracula is a sex offender, an extremely disturbed individual 
who requires not a stake through the heart but psychiatric treatment in a 
secure custodial setting. This Dracula is not so much wicked as sick. 
</P>
<P>
 It's appropriate then that we should first meet him in the Salpetriere, the 
Parisian asylum where the great Charcot, teacher of Freud, did his pioneering 
worked on hysteria. Laszlo is an impoverished medical student at this stage of 
the story, and has yet to inherit the title from his older brother. From the 
very start of his medical training the young Hungarian is fascinated by the 
sight of blood. He begins furtively to taste it. He is greatly excited when a 
female patient called Stacia savagely slashes her wrists with a scalpel and 
requires 54 stitches. His excitement is intensified by the fact that he is 
already conducting a torrid affair with Stacia, who by night works in a 
fashionable brothel. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot thickens when we learn that Stacia has syphilis, and that Laszlo must 
therefore also be infected. He decides not to care. He abandons himself to 
passion. The affair doesn't run into trouble until he learns she's seeing other 
men. He stabs her in the throat and kills her, and then drinks her blood. The 
next day comes news of the death of his older brother, and Laszlo returns to 
Hungary to be invested as the new count. 
</P>
<P>
 The murder of Stacia is the first major symptom of a psychiatric condition 
that in time develops into a ravening, full-blown blood-lust. In the meantime 
20 years will pass, years in which Laszlo lives quietly in his Transylvanian 
castle in a state of celibacy despite being married to his brother's widow. 
Curiously it is by reading the diary he kept during his Paris days, and the 
account it contains of Stacia's murder, that he reawakens appetites 
successfully suppressed for two decades. Again it is a powerful sexual 
attraction aggravated by jealousy that will be the stimulus to murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim this time is Estelle, daughter of the local baker, a beautiful 
young woman Laszlo installs as his mistress in a flat in Budapest. Their affair 
is steamy, and in the course of it he once more tastes blood. But when he finds 
out Estelle is deceiving him, he follows her to a lonely spot in woods near the 
castle and stabs her in the throat with a dagger. He is disappointed afterward 
that the killing is over so quickly. Later he realizes that there's a part of 
himself he cannot control, a stranger within him, a beast. 
</P>
<P>
 Where did it come from, this beast within? This question is never properly 
answered, which creates a serious problem right at the heart of the novel. It's 
connected to the author's decision not to write the standard vampire, to 
deviate so sharply from the prototype, the bloodthirsty count created by Bram 
Stoker in his Dracula of 1897. That Dracula was a wonderfully ghastly ghoul who 
turned nice English girls into creatures of voracious passion who then required 
the best efforts of Victorian manhood and Dutch science to be put back to 
sleep. Bram Stoker's Dracula is a fascinating figure because he is as rapacious 
as a savage animal and at the same time possessed of extraordinary supernatural 
powers. He isn't one of us, he is Other, magnificently and diabolically Other. 
</P>
<P>
 Roderick Anscombe's vampire by contrast is not a ghoul but a human being. For 
we are intended to see him as a man struggling with impulses over which he 
gradually loses control, and thus as someone who at root shares our human 
nature. But though we see the guilt and confusion, the fatal susceptibility to 
temptation and the gradual escalation of the sickness from the first tentative 
taste of blood to the final horrible rapes, there is no explanation as to why 
this particular Hungarian landowner should experience these wildly unusual 
urges. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the convulsions of his tormented conscience Laszlo never properly asks 
himself why his sexual relationships with women predictably culminate in 
violence. In other words there's no psychopathology, and without it Laszlo 
never quite becomes a credible, three-dimensional figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Other elements of the novel are more successful. A powerful sense of place is 
consistently evoked, particularly Charcot's Salpetriere and Dracula's 
Transylvania, which is a gloomy, forested region under brooding, heavy skies. 
The period comes across strongly, the late 19th Century, when both railways and 
nationalist politics were finding their way into the most remote and isolated 
regions of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also some gloriously macabre touches when we glimpse the weirder 
reaches of Roderick Anscombe's vivid imagination and the impressive descriptive 
power of his writing. Laszlo is sitting next to a young girl at dinner. "Her 
hand was pale and perhaps a little cold, but the white damask tablecloth 
brought out the hint of pink at the knuckles and the fingertips, and there was 
such a soft succulence about the limb that I was seized with the notion of 
biting into the fleshy bulge of the thenar eminence, of sucking at it, biting 
deeper until my teeth encountered the grit of fascia and tendons and could go 
no farther." 
</P>
<P>
 This whimsical reflection on "the magnitude of pleasure that may flow from 
devouring a maiden's hand" shows us the monster in the man as he idly refines 
in imagination his hideous appetites. We could do with more of this. But 
Roderick Anscombe has attempted also to show us the man in the monster, in fact 
he devotes the bulk of his book to that man's tortured recoil from the beast he 
shares his flesh with. 
</P>
<P>
 To understand criminal insanity is a perfectly good project for fiction, but 
it requires a scrupulous attention to the skewed machinery of the dysfunctional 
psyche. This Dracula vacillates between appetite and remorse, indulgence and 
self-denial, but little more. He displays neither the rich, complex psychology 
of the Dostoyevskyan killer, nor the awful glorious majesty of the Bram Stoker 
vampire, which is why, in the end, it's hard to care about him one way or the 
other.

RICHARD EDER: 'TO APPRECIATE HIM ALIVE'; A BIOGRAPHY THAT AIMS TO GIVE THE FEEL 
OF A SLAP ON THE BACK; CONOR: A BIOGRAPHY OF CONOR CRUISE O'BRIEN, BY DONALD 
HARMAN AKENSON (CORNELL UNIVERSITY PRESS: $35; 573 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You won't find many biographies, particularly from university presses, that 
make their title a first name: not "James" for Joyce nor "Leo" for Tolstoy nor 
"Immanuel" for Kant. Not only does Donald Harman Akenson use "Conor" as title 
for his account of the Irish writer, editor, diplomat, politician, polemicist, 
professor and peace- and trouble-maker Conor Cruise O'Brien; but he invariably 
refers to him that way in the text. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true that the Irish first-name their public figures to death -- they get 
a last name when they die -- but that's only partly the point that Akenson (a 
Canadian professor of Swedish descent) is after. His model, he tells us in the 
preface, would be two or three old men ruminating over pints in a pub: 
</P>
<P>
 "One old fellow taps another on the knee and starts to talk about 'your man,' 
whoever he might be. That's how one wants to talk about Conor, with the sense 
that he might be coming through the door any moment, and, by God, things around 
here will pick up when he does." There will be time to analyze O'Brien after he 
is dead, Akenson writes; what he is after is "to appreciate him alive." 
</P>
<P>
 "Conor" contains no lack of appreciation, not to mention coziness and author's 
jokes; not infrequently, they flood the book and dampen the reader. Yet Akenson 
conveys the temper and the performances of a remarkable man on a remarkable 
assortment of the world's front-line stages. (Given the frequency and 
storminess of his exits, perhaps one should speak of a remarkable assortment of 
first acts.) Paul Johnson, a writer of largely different political views, 
called O'Brien's biography of Edmund Burke a book "by the greatest living 
Irishman on the greatest Irishman who ever lived." 
</P>
<P>
 Akenson has labored in privileged access -- hundreds of hours with O'Brien and 
his poet wife, Maire MacEntee, interviews with friends, allies and antagonists, 
and mounds of unsorted papers in the University College library in Dublin and 
in his subject's garden shed -- but there is no reason to doubt his assertion 
that he neither showed his manuscript to O'Brien nor was asked to. He can be 
shrewdly critical, though not, I suspect, in any way that O'Brien would be 
devastated to read. What is harder and more valuable, he can be shrewdly 
admiring. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien is the scion of a comfortably prominent Irish nationalist family that 
was superseded when the 1916 Easter uprising raised the stakes. An outstanding 
student and talented literary essayist, he joined the Irish diplomatic service 
and rose rapidly, gaining a reputation for brilliance, wit and unmanageability. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in the early 1960s that these qualities made world headlines. Dag 
Hammarskjold sent him to run the United Nations effort to end the insurgency in 
Katanga, where Moise Tshombe had set up a mercenary-armed state against the 
newly independent Congo. After success and setbacks, O'Brien quit spectacularly 
with the public charge that Belgium and Great Britain were backing a puppet 
against the U.N. 
</P>
<P>
 He became a Third World hero. (Years later, O'Brien's support of Israel would 
cool the admiration, as well as illustrate a constitutional tendency to take an 
interest in his friends' enemies, and a dislike to his friends' friends.) Kwame 
Nkrumah named him to run the University of Ghana, and he stayed for three years 
struggling to keep it academically independent of his increasingly irritated 
patron. When he went to take ceremonial leave, he found Nkrumah busily writing 
and only able to look up for a moment. "Dr. O'Brien, I would like to thank you 
for what you did for the University of Ghana," Nkrumah said and paused. After a 
meditative few moments, he added: "Whatever it was." 
</P>
<P>
 At New York University, then in a flush of funds and expansion, O'Brien was 
appointed to set up a program called "Literature and Society." It combined his 
interests as a public man and a literary intellectual; and plunged him into a 
sometimes embattled relationship with the New York intelligentsia. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal battle was political. He favored resistance to military 
expansion by the Soviet Bloc but fiercely opposed U.S. interference with 
Marxist movements and insurrections in the Third World. He was among the first 
to accuse the magazine Encounter, supported by many American and English 
intellectuals, of having something other than intellectual grounds for its 
anti-Communist stance. When it came out that Encounter's parent organization 
was funded by the CIA, the resulting embarrassment seemed to justify O'Brien's 
pugnacity, but those embarrassed didn't thank him for it. He remained a star, 
though, at the New York Review of Books, even after he returned to Ireland to 
go into politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Brilliant and original performances followed by prickly departures or 
sometimes -- as when O'Brien left New York academia for the Dail -- a need for 
something new. During the eight years he spent as a Labor Party member of the 
Irish parliament, including four as a cabinet minister, O'Brien found something 
that not only was new but was to become the most deep-rooted, sustained and 
perhaps successful -- though it ended ostensibly in failure -- mission of his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only became a serious person in 1971," O'Brien told Akenson. It was the 
Northern Ireland question that provided the seriousness; a ground where the 
different facets of his heritage and life as writer, political thinker and 
political actor could come together with a prophetic consistency. 
</P>
<P>
 In brief, O'Brien, who in his younger days had been a government propagandist 
for Irish unification, found that he was seeing differently. Along with Garrett 
Fitzgerald, though much more rudely, he was one of the few southern politicians 
to insist that the Protestant majority in the north must agree before the 
island could be united. Any effort to force the British out, or even to 
negotiate them out, would, without such agreement, lead to a horrendous civil 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 This made him a bitter foe of the IRA's supporters, and an embarrassment to 
moderates in the north and south who viewed things in less apocalyptic terms. 
O'Brien's stand provoked much strife even within his Labor Party; eventually it 
ended his political career. And yet his formulation in 1970 is roughly the one 
now being used by the Irish and British governments to bring about a cease-fire 
and the prospect of negotiations. Naturally, while time has turned O'Brien's 
prophetic intransigence into today's consensus, O'Brien has characteristically 
taken up arms against consensus -- never mind that it was his -- and denounced 
the agreement. Another first-act exit. Or a sense of history's tragedy too 
profound to permit O'Brien to be a political success, but which has perhaps 
permitted him something more precious. 
</P>
<P>
 Akenson portrays a man whose talents and convictions battled each other as 
well as his own serenity of life, of which there was little. He writes of 
O'Brien's alcoholism, the breakup of his first marriage and his stormy but 
enduring marriage to Maire MacEntee, a remarkable Irish poet. (A poem to their 
adopted black son appears here with the ravishing first line: "Little clustered 
head, sweet as the blackberry.") He writes persuasively and fairly about 
O'Brien's books, particularly the profound and engrossing study of Edmund 
Burke, an Irishman and a universal thinker in whose tormented contradictions 
O'Brien has seemed to find his own, and perhaps for the first time a kind of 
peace.

COVER STORY: APOCALYPSE NOT ; CBS MOVIE ATTEMPTS TO CREATE A BELIEVABLE 
CATACLYSMIC EVENT THAT NO ONE ACTUALLY WILL BELIEVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Oct. 30, 1938, much of America panicked as Orson Welles' "Mercury Theater 
on the Air" presented H.G. Wells' "The War of the Worlds" as an apparent live 
radio-news broadcast of a Martian invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 56 years later, CBS hopes to scare the living daylights out of viewers 
Sunday evening with "Without Warning," a science-fiction drama that simulates a 
live television news broadcast. While we've had warning this time around, 
reality and fiction continue to collide. 
</P>
<P>
 The premise: Three pieces of a huge asteroid suddenly plunge to Earth and land 
in China, France and the United States. The regularly scheduled 
movie-of-the-week is preempted by the "Evening World News" anchored by veteran 
newscaster Sander Vanocur. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Vanocur, "Without Warning" features scientist and science-fiction 
writer Arthur C. Clarke ("2001: A Space Odyssey") and TV journalists Bree 
Walker-Lampley, Warren Olney and Sandy Hill. Actress Jane Kaczmarek plays 
Vanocur's co-anchor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without Warning" isn't the first time a network has presented a TV movie 
masquerading as a newscast. In 1983, NBC aired the acclaimed "Special Bulletin" 
about the threatened nuclear destruction of Charleston, S.C., written by Ed 
Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz, who later created "thirtysomething." However, in 
"Special Bulletin" actors, not actual television journalists, played 
newscasters. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS plans to air disclaimers throughout "Without Warning" explaining that the 
film is a fictionalized newscast. The disclaimers will begin before the program 
starts and continue at frequent intervals throughout, says Kenneth Martin, 
director of program practices. "It will be at least every 15 minutes," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The first disclaimer will say: " 'Without Warning' is a realistic depiction of 
fictional events. None of what you are about to see is actually happening." 
During the program the disclaimer will change to, "None of what you are seeing 
is actually happening." 
</P>
<P>
 As far as responding to audiences' fears, Martin says, "Our audience services 
area in New York will be responding to inquiries," he says. "We are interested 
in having a very compelling and dramatically intense program that is highly 
believable, but which no one believes." 
</P>
<P>
 "Without Warning" was inspired by the events that occurred last July when 
fragments from the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 struck the planet Jupiter in numerous 
places. At the time, executive producer Mark Wolper ("Queen"), son of executive 
producer David Wolper, happened to be perusing old scripts from Wolper 
Organization files to see if any might still be viable as network fare. 
</P>
<P>
 "I happened to be doing one of my searches and came across this script called 
'July 13th,' written in 1969," Wolper says during a break in the filming at a 
Burbank sound stage. "I read the script and said, 'This is perfect. This is 
asteroids coming and hitting the Earth.' So the next day, which was a Friday, I 
gave the script to CBS and on Monday they called and ordered it." 
</P>
<P>
 The original script by David Seltzer ("Punchline") was revised by former 
Emmy-winning ABC News correspondent Peter Lance. The first thing Lance did was 
take an intensive course in astronomy from the film's technical adviser, Donald 
Yeomans, senior research scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "I basically treated the script like a piece of journalism," Lance says. "I 
took the weekend to understand the science. I wanted to do something that would 
be really believable. I wanted the science to be bulletproof. If you are going 
to do something that comes out of the headlines and appears to be a news 
broadcast, it has to make sense. It has to have logic to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeomans is impressed with the technical details of the film. "It's not a 
documentary, so within the limits of the story itself, we tried to keep it 
quite realistic," he says. "There is always a chance of getting hit with an 
asteroid. We make the point in the script that it is very unlikely, but very 
unlikely is not the same thing as impossible. These comets smacking into 
Jupiter this summer show this kind of thing on a cosmic time scale happens all 
the time. In a human lifetime it's quite a rare event. The Earth is not immune 
to these impacts." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Yeomans, 250 large asteroids relatively near Earth are being 
tracked by scientists. Still, he adds, "that's only 10% of the believed 
(asteroid) population. The large ones we can track for hundreds of years into 
the future and see if they get close to the Earth. We do that at JPL." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, Yeomans says, are the smaller ones. "The 200-meter-sized objects 
have to get very close to the Earth before they're bright enough to be seen. 
What's worse is that if they are heading straight for you on a collision 
course, it's almost impossible to see until the very last minute." 
</P>
<P>
 To further heighten the realism in the film, Wolper sought out real 
newscasters. "We thought nobody could be better news reporters than news 
reporters, so whenever possible we tried to hire news reporters. They were very 
excited and they loved it. We had to audition them for the parts, so we only 
selected people we thought could carry it." 
</P>
<P>
 Actors are interspersed among the real news people. "We are trying to convince 
people this is news and fool people, but at the same time, this is drama," 
Wolper explains. "I needed actors to play the more dramatic roles -- the 
breaking down, the crying. Those kinds of scenes I have given to actors, 
because it's very difficult for news reporters to do that because they don't 
have acting experience." 
</P>
<P>
 "Acting" as himself in movies is fun for the genial Vanocur, a renowned 
correspondent for NBC, ABC and PBS. He recently appeared as himself in "Dave" 
and "TimeCop." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is being filmed over a period of four days," Vanocur explains during his 
lunch break. "I started out (in the film) low key and now I'm trying, though 
I'm not a trained actor, to convey a sense that I'm still dispassionate. But 
something is going on and I'm not quite sure what it is. But I can't go beyond 
what the information is, so unless I start to eat the furniture and the drapes 
at the end, I will remain rather dispassionate." 
</P>
<P>
 Vanocur doesn't know if "Without Warning" will scare media-sophisticated 
audiences. "Even though there are disclaimers, there's an awful lot of channel 
surfing," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 And, he adds, "I think the line between reality and fiction gets increasingly 
blurred. For example, I was in Nashville watching the NBA playoffs and suddenly 
there's O.J. Simpson (in the white Ford Bronco). I still don't know what that 
was. Was it news? Was it fiction? Was it theater?" 
</P>
<P>
 The newscast depicted in "Without Warning," Vanocur says, is neither tabloid 
nor sensationalized. "I think there's a great attention to detail, accuracy and 
no attempts as far as I can see to make it more hyped up then it needs to be. 
The tension arises from the story itself. Some of the scenes are realistic and, 
I think, because of the Shoemaker-Levy earlier this year, a lot of people think 
that may be the way the world will end." 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had still been a correspondent at ABC News, I'd have done this as a 
piece on '20/20,' " Lance says. "I'd have done this as a piece of journalism. 
It has to be done in a really responsible way. So, throughout the two hours, 
it's done in 'real time.' At the beginning, it clearly looks like an asteroid 
problem. And then, little by little, all of this evidence starts surfacing and 
sort of semi-responsible members of the search-for-intelligent-life community 
begin to make charges that there may be something more. (The newscasters) keep 
coming back and saying this is speculation. I think (in the movie) you get what 
the best TV network would do today, what the most responsible TV network would 
do if something like this ever happened in real time." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolper says "Without Warning" is meant to skewer the "tabloidy kind of people. 
Hopefully, what will happen with this show is that it will spark a lot of 
controversy after it airs. People will be scared. Is this responsible for a 
network to put on a show like this that could potentially scare people? When 
you get that controversy going, then it sparks conversations on what shows 
should be and the line between news and drama." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Wolper adds, the movie also pokes fun at the "TV movie-of-the-week makers 
because we have a little fake movie-of-the week at the beginning of this with 
Loni Anderson. That's kind of humorous in itself. That is what we break into 
it. So we are making fun of ourselves, which is interesting because our 
company, the Wolper Organization, is known for documenting reality with 
'Roots,' 'North and South' and all the Wolper documentaries. Now we are 
creating reality and fictionalizing the documentation of it. We are making our 
own reality and covering it." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Wolper and director Robert Iscove have no news experience, Wolper knew 
he needed the expertise of news veterans who understood the business. So he 
hired Lance and producer Nancy Platt Jacoby, a former CBS News producer and 
KCBS-TV executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed someone who understood how (news) is done, understood how 
(newscasters) talk, so it will be as real as possible," Wolper says. "The 
audience is smart. They will know if you are faking them or not." 
</P>
<P>
 "Without Warning" was taped in just 17 days. Besides shooting at the Burbank 
studio, crews were dispatched to Washington, D.C., New York City, Los Angeles, 
Moscow's Red Square, China's Tian An Men Square, Paris and Sri Lanka. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are shooting simultaneously," Wolper says. "It has been very difficult. 
Everything happens at night and with our time schedule and time frame, we had 
to get permission to shoot in all of these areas." 
</P>
<P>
 But the hasty schedule, he says, actually served the picture "because in the 
frantic nature of trying to get the work done, it's giving the feel of news, 
which is always very frantic. I think it has helped out the process that we had 
to rush because news people would have to do that too." 
</P>
<P>
 Putting the production together was a learning experience. "How do we get all 
of this material together? How do we shoot it?" were some of the questions he 
had to ask. "Do I hire a film crew on the outside to shoot or do I hire a real 
news crew because they know how news is shot?" 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Wolper hired a combination of crews and brought in a supervising 
director of photography who is responsible for the look of the whole movie. 
Still, Wolper says, "I didn't want too much continuity." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolper hopes "Without Warning" terrifies audiences. "What I suspect will 
happen is that if you sit down and start watching this, about five minutes into 
it, you'll say, 'My God. Is this really happening?' The first thing audiences 
are going to do is pick up their channel changer and switch it to CNN or 
another network to see if the other network is covering it. And then they will 
go back to our channel because they won't want to miss anything." 
</P>
<P>
 "Without Warning" premieres Sunday at 9 p.m. on CBS.

 The (Nielsen) ratings show that "Home Improvement" (ABC) is the No. 1 comedy 
show. After watching Sid Caesar on "Larry King Weekend" (CNN) and seeing some 
scenes from the old "Your Show of Shows," "Home Improvement" should be 
classified as a drama.

ROCKS AND A HARD PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two thoughts on the "Seismometers of the Gods" (by Michael R. Forrest, Palm 
Latitudes, Sept. 25): 
</P>
<P>
 Were Jim Brune's precariously balanced rocks formed in that position, or did 
they shift there, perhaps because of an earthquake? 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge temblor showed rather conclusively that earthquake forces can 
hopscotch over large territories, leaving one neighborhood unscathed while 
demolishing buildings a block away. Do Brune's rocks prove that the Yucca 
Mountain site is stable, or only that the ground directly below the rocks is? 
Do they even prove that much, given the diagonal slicing effects noted Jan. 17? 
</P>
<P>
 I, for one, don't feel at all reassured. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Schmidt 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City  
</P>
<P>
 Forrest replies: Precarious rocks are indeed formed in place, but even if they 
were not, the desert varnish that's found on the rocks can tell you how long 
they have been standing still.  
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake's hopscotching was due to localized site effects 
including soil amplification and topography. As Tom Henyey of the Southern 
California Earthquake Center described hopscotching, "There was shaking 
everywhere in the L.A. Basin, but with pockets of anomalously strong shaking. 
And you don't need unusually strong shaking to bring down rocks."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brune may refer to the precariously piled rocks he found in the desert near 
Victorville as "seismometers of the gods," but they are probably calendars of 
the Indians. They appear to be piled so that people standing in a certain place 
would see the sun through the window and know what time of year it was -- a 
small version of Stonehenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Brune's stability theory is baseless and offers false encouragement to those 
worried about the proposed Ward Valley radioactive waste dump near Victorville. 
</P>
<P>
 He also ignores the new fault forming at a tangent to the San Andreas, heading 
across the Mojave Desert toward Victorville. 
</P>
<P>
 Radioactive waste could be put into glass containers and stored and monitored 
for leaks in warehouses. Or even better, it could be changed into inert 
components. The worst solution would be to bury it in the desert 20 miles from 
the Colorado River, cross our fingers and hope we don't wind up polluting the 
drinking water of more than 20 million people in the Southwest.

 Stronger on production design than substance, the 1991 Addams Family (NBC 
Sunday at 9 p.m.), starring Raul Julia as Gomez and Anjelica Huston as 
Morticia, turns on the most modest of plots. The beloved ghouls of Charles 
Addams' amusingly sinister New Yorker cartoons areinvolved with hidden 
treasure, a crooked lawyer (Dan Hedaya) and a mother-obsessed yegg (Christopher 
Lloyd) who may or may not be Gomez's long-lost brother. 
</P>
<P>
 In An American Werewolf in London (KCAL Sunday at 9 p.m.), director John 
Landis juxtaposes humor and gore so outrageously that you don't know whether to 
laugh or cringe. The 1981 film is not for the squeamish or the vey young. But 
many will consider it a poignant, delirious treat. David Naughton and Griffin 
Dunne are a couple of nice guys from New York hiking through northern England 
when they meet the unexpected on the moors. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1991 Warlock (KTLA Monday at 8 p.m.), a supernatural shocker about 
"Satan's son" (Julian Sands) running amok, begins in Boston during the witch 
hunts. It time-warps over to modern Los Angeles and back to Beantown, but 
without a trace of originality interfering with the demonic doings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seventh Sign (KTLA Tuesday at 8 p.m.), a heavy-breathing 1988 supernatural 
thriller, envisions a chic apocalypse that culminates in the pregnancy of a 
Venice Beach woman (Demi Moore), a race to prevent an execution and, finally, 
no less than the second coming of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1991 Class Action (KTLA Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is good, chewy entertainment, 
part courtroom pyrotechnics, part Machiavellian legal maneuvers. 
Father-and-daughter attorneys -- defender of the underdog Gene Hackman and 
sharp corporate lawyer Mary Elizabeth Mastroantonio -- find themselves on 
opposite sides of a class-action suit involving defective automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Twins (KTLA Thursday at 8 p.m.), an overblown, self-destructing 1988 
comedy-thriller, wastes Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny De Vito as fraternal -- 
well, you weren't expecting identical -- twins. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the appeal of the 1991 Bugsy (NBC Friday at 8 p.m.) lies in the fact 
that both gangster extraordinaire Benjamin (Bugsy) Siegel and Warren Beatty, 
who plays him, seem to be charmers for whom the ordinary rules of life don't 
seem to apply. Beatty, writer James Toback and director Barry Levinson each 
brought markedly different sensibilities to the project. The result -- though 
not without flaws -- is a satisfying film that delivers a full measure of 
stylish entertainment. Key developments are Siegel's growing infatuation with 
good-time girl Virginia Hill (Annette Bening) and his dream of turning Las 
Vegas into a gambling mecca. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest Scared Stupid (ABC Saturday at 8 p.m.) is a silly Halloween horror 
comedy -- the fourth in the goofy "Ernest" series starring Jim Varney -- but at 
least it has the stylish, witty presence of Eartha Kitt as a kind of backwoods 
Louise Nevelson with an interest in the occult.

 Nina J. Easton's "Insult and Injury" (Oct. 2) was a thorough and insightful 
look at a difficult and troubling issue. As a parent deeply involved in a 
sexual harassment issue at my daughter's school, I came up against the conflict 
between punishment and education. The school's nasty and harsh punishment of 
one student and the total educational neglect of all involved made a bad 
situation worse. Perpetrators of sexual harassment must be held responsible, 
but they also must be educated if we are to have any hopes for long-term change 
in the way men and women treat each other. 
</P>
<P>
 My daughter's questions early in the course of the problem were: "Why are you 
calling this sexual harassment? Isn't it just mean?" Young people need to know 
when normal, harmless teasing crosses the line into sexual harassment.

 I was in the seventh grade in the early '70s, living in a white-bread 
community much like Petaluma, when a rumor that I was pregnant circulated. The 
heckling was brutal and constant. One time, while I sat on a bench at 
lunchtime, about 40 kids gathered around me, jeering, shouting, laughing and 
throwing french fries that caught in my hair. 
</P>
<P>
 The dean of boys thought a fight was in progress and pushed through the crowd. 
I recall his blank, puzzled expression when he found at the center of the melee 
a lone, pimply, frightened 11-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 After finding lunch sanctuary in the school library, I started my long descent 
into depression, and no one intervened. My effortless high grades dropped, I 
refused to participate in class, I gained substantial weight and wore the same 
clothes day after day in an attempt to become invisible. I was already a 
bookworm and a loner, and this situation forced me to turn inward, to become my 
own person and stay solid, no matter what happened in the outside world. I got 
a good look at an ugly but undeniable fact of human nature, and it made me 
strong. It made me who I am.

 That's life. File it away and move on.

 No, no -- Easton has it all wrong when she writes that what school districts 
need at this time is "widespread teacher training and a curriculum designed to 
teach children how to treat one another with respect." What we need are parents 
who teach their children the parameters of acceptable behavior in all aspects 
of daily life. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is it that teachers "need to educate those children, and they're not doing 
it." The parents of those children should have trained them from day one. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers should be trained to teach academics while the students' home 
training is being reinforced. We must stop expecting teachers to be surrogate 
parents.

 Just what kind of wimps are we raising in this country? 
</P>
<P>
 As a heavy kid who spent 12 years in the New York City public schools, I was 
tormented daily in ways that Jane Doe probably cannot comprehend. Most of it 
was at the hands of some very aggressive pupils, badgering me for my lunch 
money, or just for the hell of it. They were hassling me simply because I I was 
an easy, too-sensitive target. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember getting laughed at because I referred to a "pussycat" once during 
story time, not understanding the sexual implications, and how one of the girls 
in the back of the room hiked up her skirt in order to to underline the 
allusion. 
</P>
<P>
 My reaction to these incidents and others like them was not to cry, whine to 
the authorities or complain to my mother. Instead, I reached the conclusions 
that (1) most people are idiots, (2) multiculturalism is a license that allows 
certain individuals to do as they wish with no fear of reprisal from cowed 
authorities and (3) naivete is for the birds. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, I grew up. Peer pressure became irrelevant, so drug use and 
sexual promiscuity passed me by. As for Jane Doe and her so-called abuse, I've 
got three words of advice: Deal with it.

 NOA NOA: The Tahiti Journal of Paul Gauguin translated by O.F. Theis. 
(Chronicle: $17.95; 147 pp.) Just when you thought you might escape to France 
to resurrect your sensual self, here is the journal Gaugin kept when he ran 
away from France to Tahiti. Unable to find a publisher after his return to 
France, Gaugin published the journal himself, but Chronicle has now published a 
version that includes the drawings the artist made in the margins. "I am 
leaving," he wrote upon his departure after only two years (1894-1896), "older 
by two years, but twenty years younger; more barbarian than when I arrived, and 
yet much wiser." He admired the Maoris in his own way, but was oddly successful 
in finding exactly what he seemed to be looking for. "I question," he wrote, 
lying in bed with his 13-year-old wife Tehura, plucked in a trip to a 
neighboring village to cure Gaugin's "restlessness," "and not all of my 
questions remain unanswered." Gauguin went to Tahiti, as we know, to shake off 
"the absurdities of civilization." And really, this is a journal about a 
culture seen through its women. "With the beautiful instinct of her race," he 
says of the queen, Marau, "she dispersed grace everywhere about her, and made 
everything she touched a work of art." "All indeed," Gaugin observes of these 
women, "wish to be 'taken,' literally, brutally 'taken,' without a single 
word." Of his first Maori courtesan, Titi, he writes, "There is a fire in her 
blood, which calls forth love as its essential nourishment; which exhales it 
like a fatal perfume.These eyes and this mouth cannot lie." And of his wife: 
"Tehura never disturbs me when I work or when I dream. . . . She knows 
perfectly when she can speak without disturbing me." "I am learning to know the 
silence of a Tahitian night," Gauguin wrote, but one still wonders what 
happened to that young Tahitian bride when her French husband of two years left 
her on the beach.

AIR RAID, BY STEPHEN SPENDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In this room like a bowl of flowers filled with light 
</P>
<P>
 Family eyes look down on the white ceiling 
</P>
<P>
 Pages of a book, and the white ceiling 
</P>
<P>
 Like starch of a nurse, reflects a calm feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter, with hands outstretched to the fire, 
</P>
<P>
 Transmits through her veins the peaceful desire 
</P>
<P>
 Of the family tree, from which she was born, 
</P>
<P>
 To push tendrils through dark to a happier dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ancient house or the glass-and-steel flat 
</P>
<P>
 The vertical descendants of the genes that 
</P>
<P>
 Go back far in the past, are supported by floors 
</P>
<P>
 And protected by walls from the weather outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the complex stage settings they act out the parts 
</P>
<P>
 Of their bodies enclosing their human hearts 
</P>
<P>
 With limbs utilizing chairs, tables, cups, 
</P>
<P>
 All the necessities and props. 
</P>
<P>
 They wear the right clothes and go the right ways, 
</P>
<P>
 Read the news, and play golf, and fill out their days 
</P>
<P>
 With hobbies, meals brought from the kitchen range. 
</P>
<P>
 And no one sees anything eerie or strange 
</P>
<P>
 In all this. And perhaps they are right. Nothing is 
</P>
<P>
 Until an unreasoning fury impinges 
</P>
<P>
 From an enemy's vision of life, on their hearth. 
</P>
<P>
 And explodes. And tears their loved home down to earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the inside-turned-outside faces the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubble decently buries the dead human meat. 
</P>
<P>
 Piled above it, a bath, a wardrobe, books, telephone 
</P>
<P>
 Though all who could answer its ringing have gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing unscathed in one solitary wall, 
</P>
<P>
 Half a floor attached, forgotten to fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Convolvulus patterns of pink and blue line 
</P>
<P>
 That rectangle high up where they once used to dine. 
</P>
<P>
 Bemused passers-by are bound to observe 
</P>
<P>
 That inside-shown-outside like the deep curve 
</P>
<P>
 Of mother-o'-pearl exposed in a shell 
</P>
<P>
 Where a mollusc, long-smashed, at one time did dwell. 
</P>
<P>
 But the house has been cracked in an enemy's claws, 
</P>
<P>
 Years of love ground down to rubble in jaws, 
</P>
<P>
 And the tender sensitive life thrown away 
</P>
<P>
 By the high-flying will of the enemy's day. 
</P>

 MUTANT MESSAGE DOWN UNDER by Marlo Morgan. (HarperCollins: $18; 187 pp.) This 
wild adventure comes with an odd disclaimer as a preface: It is "sold as a 
novel," the author tells us, "to protect the small tribe of Aborigines from 
legal involvement."This is somewhat similar to the confusion over another book 
with a message, carried by its author back to Western civilization: "The 
Celestine Prophesy." Is it fiction or nonfiction? Readers don't seem to care. 
They buy these books by the thousands. Morgan, an American doctor from the 
midwest, with a lifelong fascination for the Australian Outback, is summoned 
there some time in her 50s to work with the Aborigines. Expecting to be thanked 
for her work with a traditional awards luncheon, she is instead taken, 
completely unprepared, on a walkabout across the desert for three months. 
During that time, her bare feet harden into hoofs, she learns to eat various 
insects, she learns how to find water, she learns how to speak without 
language, and she is set on the path to fulfill some destiny established long 
before her birth: to bring a message about these people, the Wild Ones, the 
Real People, back to her own tribe. The message is about listening to the 
earth, leaving people who are different alone and being compassionate while 
making others strong. It is not beautifully written, it is straightforward. 
There is almost no context in which to place this adventure in Morgan's life, 
before or after the journey. There is something of a context in the life of the 
tribe, which has collectively decided that they will no longer have children 
(the youngest is 13 years old), that they will die out. It is not really about 
what happens to Morgan, which is refreshingly un-self-centered.

 WHY PEOPLE PHOTOGRAPH by Robert Adams. (Aperture: $16.95; 186 pp.) "If I like 
many photographers," writes Adams, chronicler of the American West, "and I do, 
I account for this by noting a quality they share -- animation.They may or may 
not make a living by photography, but they are alive by it." It seems that this 
springiness we all recognize as a quality many photographers possess comes from 
the element of surprise associated with their craft: "They do not know where in 
the world they will find pictures. Nobody does. Each photograph that works is a 
revelation to its supposed creator." The book is a long celebratory essay of 
this art form, for whose artists the very need to use words signifies failure. 
It is a dance through the photographs of Gary Winogrand, Paul Strand, Laura 
Gilpin, Ansel Adams, Dorothea Lange, Eugene Atget, Edward Weston and many 
others. It outlines what is noble and necessary in the life of a photographer 
(for example, the importance of dogs, because "Art depends on there being 
affection in its creator's life, and an artist must find ways, like everyone 
else, to nourish it"). Adams writes about photographing one plateau northwest 
of Denver over two decades, a place he has chosen because it is near his home 
and because it is emblematic of the destruction of the West. "Art does not deny 
that evil is real," he writes of this destruction, "but it places evil in a 
context that implies an affirmation," suggesting "that evil is not final."

 WATCH WITH ME: And Six Other Stories of the Yet-Remembered Ptolemy Proudfoot 
and His Wife, Miss Minnie, Nee Quinch by Wendell Berry. (Pantheon: $21; 210 
pp.) Wendell Berry is a native Kentuckian who farms on 125 acres in Henry 
County. After that he is a poet, an essayist (good, hard work and taking care 
of things are his favorite subjects), and a storyteller. His fiction is by far 
the gentlest of the three genres, as his poetry and essays don't really waste 
any time telling us we're doing things all wrong. But these stories (about a 
different tribe from the Aborigines, but with some of the same values; see 
"Mutant Message," above) quietly tell about a way of life that Berry clearly 
admires. "Miss Minnie had the gift of neatness." A schoolteacher by training, 
she marries Tol (Ptolemy), who is "overabundant in both size and strength," who 
embodies "very powerful tender feelings," especially for Miss Minnie. He is "as 
neat as a pin in all his work," but "about the same degree careless of his own 
appearance." There world together, outside of their 98-acre farm, has a "radius 
of about four miles." Between the First World War and the young ones moving 
away, Tol is the last of the Proudfoots in the Katy's Branch Valley. And Tol 
and Minnie do not have children. The story called "The Solemn Boy," is about a 
poor proud man and his son, wandering away from the city, who are given a meal 
and a warm coat by the Proudfoots. Tol watches his wife fluttering around the 
boy, sees "how her hand hovered above the boy's shoulder, wanting to touch 
him," and in this tiny observation all the sadness of their not having children 
is contained. That's the way Berry writes fiction.

 HOLLYWOOD HAUNTED: A Ghostly Tour of Filmland by Laurie Jacobson and Marc 
Wanamaker (Angel City Press : $16.95 ; 128 pp.) Sometimes it seems that the 
most frightening thing about Hollywood is the movies the studios think are 
suitable for public consumption.But this tidy book provides a thorough look at 
more traditionally scary material: the movie-related ghosts who haunt Southern 
California. Helped by a psychic and a parapsychologist (and a fine graphic look 
by the Fibonacci Design Group), the authors track down ghosts in restaurants, 
ghosts in studios, even ghosts in the Comedy Store, which used to be a 
nightclub and gangster haunt called Ciro's. While some phantoms cited wouldn't 
frighten Shirley Temple, a description of the Headless Ghost of Beverly Glen 
gets the blood flowing. And "Hollywood Haunted" is not without a sense of 
humor. Talking about once-prevalent sightings of a horror star at a now removed 
Hollywood and Vine bus stop, the authors admit: "The ghost of Lon Chaney has 
not been seen there since, but you can still wait an eternity for a bus in 
Hollywood." Kenneth Turan

 The charming ink-and-watercolor paintings on envelopes ("Special Delivery," 
Style, by Dr. James Brust, Sept. 25) reminded me of my own penchant for 
sketching on homeward-bound envelopes during World War II. Those 
ink-and-colored-pencil cartoons reflected the trials and tribulations of life 
as a P-47 fighter pilot. I was told by one of the recipients that she couldn't 
pick up her letters until they had circulated to the staff of the local post 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Guess where this idea of decorating the U.S. mail came from. It was in a class 
with Fred (Pop) Lueders in the late 1930s that I saw his unique way of 
personalizing correspondence, and I learned the joys of sketching. In Lueders' 
long career, he reached many students. 
</P>
<P>
 I married the young lady I tried to impress with my sketches, and both of us 
have had enjoyable careers in teaching.

 It was startling to discover that these charming watercolors had been directed 
at the remarkable young woman who occupied the iron lung alongside my own when 
the 1953 polio epidemic struck. Luckily, I escaped all ventilators after eight 
months at Rancho Los Amigos Hospital, but Myra Johnston had to be maintained in 
one 24 hours a day until her death 12 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Lueders clearly had heard about Johnston, how she used a mouth stick to paint 
watercolors of her own, how her quiet light beamed on everyone in her limited 
world. This mystery search by Dr. James Brust has rekindled memories of a 
beautiful person.

 The artistry and charm of Lueders' work is remarkable, but even more 
impressive is Brust's relentless search for an unknown artist he chanced upon 
at a swap meet. I imagine that at the onset of his detective work, Brust had no 
idea that his story would include Pete Rozelle, Bill Hanna and even the 
California Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 The article was timely, since I received a special delivery of my own that 
week. Out of the blue, a childhood pen pal sent me a stack of envelopes and 
letters I had illustrated with renderings of my pets. She'd kept them for 
almost 20 years.

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; MONSTER WANNA-BES MAKE THEIR DEBUT 
ON CABLE'S NICKELODEON ... 'AAAHH!!!' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They're not as gross as the Brothers Grunt over on MTV, but the adolescent 
beasts of Nickelodeon's Aaahh!!! Real Monsters are still in training. 
</P>
<P>
 Nickelodeon's new series comes to the cable channel courtesy of Klasky Csupo 
Inc., which brought the animated "Duckman" and "Edith Ann" to the small screen. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the monster madness are Ickis, Krumm and Oblina. Stories take 
place in the monster underworld, where the creepy trio live and attend school 
at the monster academy, and in the human world, where they venture to gain 
hands-on experience in scaring the daylights out of people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Designwise, the characters have more in common with the Beatles' 'Yellow 
Submarine' animated film than with anything you see on Saturday morning 
television," says Nick programming executive Herb Scannell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aaahh!!! Monsters" also shares something with films of the '40s, according to 
creator Gabor Csupo. "The show has a very film noirish look," he says from his 
Hollywood production office. "They live in a city dump which is reminiscent of 
both the look of 'Blade Runner' and 'Brazil.' " 
</P>
<P>
 One show that the creators of "Aaahh!!! Monsters" prefer not to be compared to 
is its sister channel's "Brothers Grunt," despite the similarity in concepts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't really a comparison," Csupo says. "This is a lot more story 
driven. I think the 'Brothers Grunt' is more idea driven. The look is totally 
different too. There is a real friendship going on in our show. The three 
monsters are realizing they can only get ahead if they help out each other and 
use (their) own strengths and weaknesses together. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message ultimately is, if you stay together you can achieve things." 
</P>
<P>
 The show's pilot won first prize for film animation produced for television at 
both the Houston Film Festival and the Ottowa Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aaahh!!! Monsters" premieres Monday at 11 a.m. on Nickelodeon. For ages 2 to 
11. More Family Shows 
</P>
<P>
 Launching "The ABC Kids Movie Matinee" is an animated musical version of The 
Secret Garden (Saturday 10:30 a.m. ABC), Frances Hodgson Burnett's tale of a 
tart-tongued orphan sent to live with her mysterious uncle in his mansion on 
the coast of England. For ages 2 to 10.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Enough kids tuned into "American Gladiators" that the producers created 
Gladiators 2000 (Saturday noon KTLA; 8 a.m. KUSI; 3 p.m. KMIR) just for them. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth-oriented version features high-tech special effects and events 
inspired by its parent show, with participants ages 10 to 13 competing against 
each other. Also included are question-and-answer sessions that test 
participants' knowledge of subjects such as health, nutrition and physical 
fitness. 
</P>
<P>
 Highlighting Saturday's show are "Step By Step's" Christopher Castile and 
"Home Improvement's" Zachery Ty Bryan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gladiators 2000" is kid-hosted as well, by Maria Sansone, 13, former host of 
ABC's "Wide World of Sports for Kids," and Ryan Seacrest, 19, former host of 
ESPN's "Radical Outdoor Challenge." For ages 4 to 13.

COMMENTARY; A 'MIGHTY' QUANDARY ABOUT VIOLENCE AND CHILDREN'S PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID ZURAWIK, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is it a reactionary move to self-censorship or an enlightened decision by 
Scandinavian broadcasters from which their American counterparts could learn? 
Is there a message in it for American parents who worry about the effects 
television shows, such as "The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" and "Mutant Ninja 
Turtles," might be having on their children? 
</P>
<P>
 Those were key questions that educators, researchers, child-care specialists 
and parents were asking in reaction to news that "The Mighty Morphin Power 
Rangers" -- the highest-rated kids' TV show in America -- had been pulled from 
the airwaves in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 The show was taken off the air -- and later scheduled to be reinstated this 
year on Scandinavian broadcaster TV3 -- because Norwegians believe it might be 
linked to the shocking death recently of a 5-year-old girl, Silje Marie 
Redergaard. The girl's body was found beaten and partly undressed. She had been 
kicked, punched and hit with a rock, then left to freeze to death in the snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Who would do such a horrible thing? Three of her male playmates, police say. 
Two of the boys are 6; one is 5. 
</P>
<P>
 At press time, the only reported link between the killing and children's 
television comes from an early version of the incident one of the boys gave 
police. He initially said teen-age boys attacked and killed the girl, and that 
he chased them away when he "kicked one of them until he bled -- just like the 
Mutant Ninja Turtles do." 
</P>
<P>
 "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" is an animated show that features likable 
heroes kung-fu kicking and karate-chopping evil opponents. "Power Rangers" is a 
live-action show featuring kung-fu teen-age heroes. Both shows are targeted at 
4- to 12-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 While pulling "Power Rangers" based on the reported link in Norway might seem 
premature to some, several experts say there is more than enough evidence in 40 
years of research on kids and television to support this ounce of prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Sheri Parks, who teaches a course in "Children and Television" at the 
University of Maryland, College Park, believes there is an indisputable link 
between children watching violence on television and aggressive behavior, 
especially in younger children. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the information available at this time, no direct or indirect linkage 
between this event and any children's telecast in Scandinavia has been 
established," says Barry Stagg, vice president of Saban Entertainment, the 
producer of the "Power Rangers." "Although our show has no direct linkage in 
this grievous occurrence, we remain deeply saddened by this tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox Broadcasting, the network that carries the series in America, declined 
comment. Earlier this year, however, Margaret Loesch, president of the Fox 
Children's Network, was asked about violence in the show and whether she feared 
kids might imitate it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not worried about 'Power Rangers' because frankly we have gotten very 
little criticism. We've gotten almost no letters of complaints from parents, 
for example, because it's such a silly show," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if watching "Power Rangers" could contribute to 6-year-olds attacking a 
playmate, Parks said yes, "especially if they see the aggressive behavior as 
valued the way it is in these shows. And research shows that it's more likely 
to be boys acting aggressively." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Jerome Singer, of the Yale University Family Television Research Center, 
agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a risk to kids from shows like these," said Singer, a psychologist. 
"The research data consistently points to the fact that children who watch 
violent or aggressive material -- material that's relatively realistic and 
imitable -- on television or video are more likely to be aggressive afterward." 
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing 3,000 studies on the effects of TV violence, the American 
Psychological Assn. in 1992 issued a report titled "Big World, Small Screen: 
The Role of Television in American Society." Among other things, the report 
said: "The accumulated research clearly demonstrates a correlation between 
viewing violence and aggressive behavior. ... Children and adults who watch a 
large number of aggressive programs also tend to hold attitudes and values that 
favor the use of aggression to resolve conflicts."

FOR YOUNG ADULTS: LAUGHTER AS ANTIDOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE CURLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bulimia -- also known as "binge/purge syndrome" -- the subject of a comic 
novel? Fat chance, as the 13-year-old heroine of Leslea Newman's new novel is 
fond of saying. But in Fat Chance (Putnam: $14.95), eighth-grader Judi Beth 
Liebowitz is genuinely funny when she writes -- obsessively, daily -- in her 
diary about the painful struggle between her love of food and her desire to be 
thin. 
</P>
<P>
 Judi's role model is the gorgeous and popular Nancy Pratt, possessed of both a 
boyfriend and a fabulous wardrobe of fashionably skimpy clothes, into which she 
squeezes each day only by dint of vomiting up nearly everything she eats. This 
simple -- and possibly deadly -- skill she gladly teaches Judi, in exchange for 
Judi standing lookout at the school restroom door after lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Judi, luckily, eventually opens her heart to a teacher (herself a fat woman 
who is happy with her size), then lets her mother and a counselor in on her 
secret, but not before a whole suspenseful novel's worth of plot twists and 
turns. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman, the author of a collection of short stories called "A Letter to Harvey 
Milk" and "Eating Our Hearts Out," a book of women's writings on food, says 
that her own life has been fraught with "body issues." It's clear from her 
clever, compassionate writing here that she has learned a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fat Chance" is a fabulous book which I recommend without reservation to 
people of any age who have ever asked themselves, "Why did I eat that?" The 
novel serves both as a good read and an educational tool for those who would 
like to understand more about the eating disorders that have become epidemic in 
our society, especially among young women. 
</P>
<P>
 Just in passing I mention how odd it is that Newman's publisher, in listing 
the author's previous books on the jacket copy, neglects to mention that she 
also wrote one of the most famous (not to say notorious) children's books of 
modern times. Newman's picture book "Heather Has Two Mommies," about the child 
of a lesbian couple, last year touched off a nationally newsworthy educational 
controversy leading to the resignation of New York City's Chancellor of Schools 
Joseph Fernandez. Strange oversight! 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Dorris, author of "Yellow Raft on Blue Water" and other adult novels, 
follows the success of his first book for children ("Morning Girl") with Guests 
(Hyperion: $13.95; ages 8-12). "Morning Girl" centered around a young Taino 
girl and her encounter with the European explorers who "discovered" America. 
"Guests" describes an early meeting between white settlers and a young Native 
American called Moss living in what came to be known as New England and a young 
Native American called Moss. Dorris sketches his characters and their world so 
well that we long not to leave them behind after the story ends.

ON THE TOWN: FRANK APPRAISALS; A PUDDLE OF BEER, THE AFTERTASTE OF GARLIC AND 
PLENTY OF MACHO RANTS AND RAVES: MAL APPETIT! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The oddest diner in the Southland might be a place -- let's call it Frank's -- 
in one of L.A.'s older suburbs. It's a small lunch counter with 10 stools, a 
wall full of yellowing reviews and a proprietor, Frank, famous for his abusive 
wit. The hamburgers there can be slightly bizarre, garnished with almost 
punitive amounts of zucchini and buried underneath dusty drifts of garlic 
powder large enough to remind you of that scene in "Scarface" where Al Pacino 
buries his face in powder of another kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunch at Frank's has been a ritual for generations of abuse-hungry Angelenos. 
Though I am actually fond of the food, I hadn't been to Frank's in about 10 
years. The last time I was in, Frank stuck his schnoz in the face of the woman 
I had brought and asked her if she was some kind of lesbian. In fact, she was, 
but she didn't particularly feel like discussing her romantic life with hostile 
strangers just then. We got up and left without eating more than a bite or two, 
and Frank's curses followed us all the way to the car. The aftertaste of garlic 
powder was as bitter as gall. 
</P>
<P>
 But last Friday, I wandered into Frank's again, and the place was really quite 
amazing; it was a fiesta of code violations, a vision from a hamburger Hogarth. 
Swaths of paint hung from the peeling ceiling, and a wizened chop on the grill 
looked as though it had been cooking since last Tuesday. Half a dozen guys 
puffing big cigars filled the room with smoke thick enough to obscure the sign 
that read "This Is a No-Smoking Establishment." Most of the cigar smokers were 
playing blackjack for money with the restaurant's owner, and a fight almost 
broke out when one of them did a quick count and discovered that he had lost 
$80 playing with a 49-card deck. A customer drank from a 40-ounce bottle of 
malt liquor that he'd probably imported from the local 7-Eleven; another fondly 
thanked the owner for slipping his underage son a glass of beer half a dozen 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank did not look happy to see me. "We're out of meat," he scowled, turning 
back to the cards. I figured he was kidding (he wasn't, but I settled for the 
shrimp), so I sat down, picked up a filthy bar rag and proceeded on my own to 
blot up a pool of stale beer on the counter. For the next 40 minutes, until the 
game broke up, I might as well have gone to Jack in the Box down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The card players razzed Frank about his ancestry, and he in turn speculated 
about the habits of their grandmothers. He waved a knife, and he cheated so 
blatantly that the other players laughed. Every couple of minutes he picked up 
the telephone, dialed a number and shouted: "Goddamn you!" at the top of his 
lungs into the receiver. When he was momentarily without a target, he snarled 
insults at his dishwasher, and there didn't seem to be a tic, a spasm of 
nastiness that his customers didn't lap up with their fries. 
</P>
<P>
 But worst of all was the running political monologue that Frank had going -- 
sub-Limbaughian macho ranting that, unfortunately, seemed contagious. When a 
customer cheered the three-strikes rule for felons, Frank proposed that a 
one-strike rule would be better. When someone else brought up the death 
penalty, Frank upped the ante to executions in a public square. He complained 
about the "immigrant problem" -- I think his beef had mostly to do with what he 
perceived as illegals taking up all the good parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally he went too far. "Say what you will about the guy," Frank said. 
"Hitler would have California cleaned up in about three days." 
</P>
<P>
 The diner grew quiet. Suddenly, most of the men remembered work they had to go 
back to, long commutes home that had to be made before rush hour. Frank was 
bored. "I'll flip you for the check," he said, tossing me a quarter. "Heads, 
your meal is free; tails, you pay me double." I shook my head no, slapped down 
a 10 and hurried out into the smog.

VANTAGE POINT; A PAINTER AND STORYTELLER RELATES HER FATHER'S CHILDHOOD IN 
CHINA; BABA: A RETURN TO CHINA UPON MY FATHER'S SHOULDERS, BY BELLE YANG 
(HARCOURT BRACE: $27.95; 240 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Howard Goldblatt, Howard Goldblatt is a Chinese scholar and translator. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cover of "Baba" fills your eye with splashes of vibrant color and an 
explosion of Chinese folk figures and symbols, above which rests the book's 
evocative image of the author perched upon her father's shoulders to revisit 
the events of his childhood. Before you have even opened Belle Yang's 
captivating memoir of a China that now seems so remote, you are hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Yang, who emigrated from Taiwan to America as a child in the 1960s, grew up to 
become an artist, following in the footsteps of her father; over the 
intervening years he entertained her with tales of life in Northeast China of 
the 1930s and 1940s, a place and time tantalizingly beyond her reach. Wanting 
to share those memories more intimately and draw closer to her father, she knew 
she would have "to tap into the original language in which his ideas were given 
form." So she went to China and spent three years studying art at Beijing's 
Academy of Traditional Chinese Painting, learning spoken and written Chinese, 
and traveling around the vast landscape. Upon her return to America in 1989, in 
the wake of the horrors of Tian An Men Square, she was finally able to "ask the 
questions that would stir (her father) enough to carry (her) into the past." 
Baba is the glorious result of these two interwoven journeys, taken half a 
century apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Born the fourth of seven children in a prominent, sprawling family 
transplanted generations earlier from south of the Great Wall to the Manchurian 
steppes, Joseph Yang -- Baba -- was submerged in the rituals of traditional 
Chinese life, with its rigid hierarchies, weighty Confucian morality and 
collective ethos. In 1931, when he was 3 years old, the more familiar predators 
-- bandits, warlords, and a host of fanciful charlatans -- were replaced by the 
most voracious plunderers of all, the Japanese Imperial forces; they occupied 
Manchuria and set up the puppet state of Manchukuo. 
</P>
<P>
 Yang's text is rich in humanity, with healers, wastrels, beggars, goblins, 
family members as perplexing as they are endearing, even a living Buddha 
(slightly tarnished). The people in these tales occupy themselves with births 
and deaths and weddings and errant train rides; with posturing and saving face 
and making stupid life decisions. These are folk tales grounded securely in 
reality, ghost stories with human twists and recaptured moments that are often 
painful to narrator and reader alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Lavishy illustrated and lovingly narrated, Baba wonderfully evokes the sights, 
sounds and emotions of a lost childhood. The influence of folk art on Yang is 
strikingly obvious in the two dozen sparkling watercolors that illuminate the 
text; yet it is to her credit as a writer that while readers may well come for 
the wonderful paintings, they will stay for the prose. There are wonderful 
descriptions, where all share in the rewards of Yang's wordsmithing, even the 
ugly daughter of a medicine man with miraculous curative powers: 
</P>
<P>
 "Daye being rather a progressive thinker (and having no other choice), his 
hope came to rest upon his other child -- a daughter. Now, this daughter -- a 
short, squat, swarthy woman with bulbous eyes and yellow, rat-like teeth that 
sprouted between her normal adult ones, leaning every which way like disrupted 
roof tiles -- was so homely, she aroused pity and brought silent condolences to 
people's lips." 
</P>
<P>
 Or the depiction of the mysterious, soup-slurping hanger-on who sees the past 
and the future with equal clarity: 
</P>
<P>
 "Idiot Yuan wore a silk skullcap atop a spray of long hair that was cut 
bluntly at the shoulders -- hair so black it absorbed all light. He sniffled 
and snuffled, fluid always threatening to slide out of his nose and down his 
stringy beard. His big, bloodshot eyes were shaded by protrusive brow ridges, 
above which vertical veins, like two purple cords, throbbed. The man was poor 
in expressions, hanging only one upon his swarthy face: that of a foolish 
half-smile." 
</P>
<P>
 Yang routinely brings such images to life with her ability to choose words as 
colors and create sentences that flow like brush strokes. The filtering process 
of the tales -- from father to daughter to reader -- produces a remarkable 
clarity of vision and insistent narrative continuity; then each event or theme 
is captured in crystalline permanence by Yang's artwork. Whenever I searched 
the paintings for something I might have missed (which was often), I was led 
back to the text from which it emerged: to bottles in the sky (those curious, 
and deadly, Japanese bombs), or table scraps (gathered by an aging peasant 
couple), or the "firewagon" (on which village women take an unanticipated joy 
ride), or a set of four quite different weddings and a funeral.). 
</P>
<P>
 Yang moves effortlessly from the role of mediator of her father's memory voice 
to that of interpreter of contexts and consequences. And she holds out the 
promise of a continuation of her father's passage through China, for the book 
ends as he prepares for a journey south to escape the ruthless search for 
"enemies of the people" by the newly arrived Communist forces. While waiting to 
see where Baba goes next, his daughter "riding high upon his shoulders to dream 
the landscape of China," the reader can return to the words and pictures of 
this remarkable book. I know I will.

PALM LATITUDES: BOTTOM LINE; DRIVING MISS BABY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sharon Tetrault 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's 11:15 a.m. and we're parked curbside at an elementary school in San Juan 
Capistrano. From among the throngs of children, a perky 5-year-old pops out and 
runs toward our van. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi, Madison, how was school?" asks the driver, Victoria Digby, as she helps 
the little girl into the front seat. Once Madison is buckled up and her 
favorite cassette, "The Lion King," is turned on, the van heads out. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither nanny nor babysitter, Digby is perhaps best described as chauffeur to 
the children. Her company, Kiddy Kab, shuttles kids around South Orange County 
in an minivan. Whether it's kindergarten, day care, gymnastic classes or soccer 
practice, the company promises to get your munchkin there on time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of all the working baby boomers and divorces these days, kids are 
suffering from a lack of transportation," explains Digby, who co-founded the 
company with her sister-in-law, Patricia Djokovich, last March after reading 
about a similar service back East. With start-up capital of $10,000, they made 
down payments on two vans, got a state transportation license and hit the road. 
(Another kid shuttle service, Wee Wheels, operates in Westminster and 
Huntington Beach.) 
</P>
<P>
 Having your kid tooled around town doesn't come cheaply: It costs $1.80 a mile 
with a three-mile minimum and $35 to enroll. After the first five miles, the 
rate drops to .90 cents a mile. 
</P>
<P>
 But for those whose nanny doesn't drive or who just can't bear to see their 
ex, Kiddy Kab seems like a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 Madison likes it: "It's fun," she says, "because I don't need my daddy." But 
older kids are another story: One insists on being dropped off around the 
corner from his school so his friends won't see his uncool transport. Just like 
when mom drives. Sharon Tetrault

PALM LATITUDES: CLIQUES; WAVEWATCHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael R. Forrest 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Earthquakes aren't predictable, but local TV's earthquake coverage sure is. 
Whenever a fault twitches enough to rattle plates, tectonic or otherwise, local 
newscasters go after seismologists Lucy Jones and Kate Hutton, of the USGS and 
Caltech, respectively, who tell us about epicenters and aftershocks and 
seismological waves. The reporters, with most of Southern California, hang on 
every word. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones and Hutton have become seismostars. But much of what we know about 
earthquakes comes from work done by seismogrunts. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California has more than 10,000 earthquakes a year, most no more 
disruptive than a stomach rumble, each a clue to quake probabilities, each 
dutifully logged by seven former and current geoscience majors in Caltech's 
seismological lab. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as the Timers, they sit in a neat row in front of their computer 
monitors, mice in hand, munching munchies, Walkman headphones shredding their 
eardrums, watching hour after tedious hour of seismogram squiggles. They're on 
the lookout for seismological waves that indicate how far away and how strong a 
quake is. When they spot them, they log their arrival time in the computer, 
which comes up with precise calculations of distance and magnitude. Wave 
watching is a chore best done by humans, says Hutton, because it's hard for a 
computer to discern a real quake signature from background noise and other 
"ghosts." 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like a nice, quiet job for nice, quiet people. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Robby Robb, 28. "To get through eight hours of this," she says, "I listen 
to really violent music, like punk and stuff, just to keep myself amped up. 
Nine Inch Nails, Dead Kennedys, that kind of stuff." She keeps a picture of 
Francisco Goya beside her screen, "glaring at me, to keep me concentrating." 
</P>
<P>
 And Eric Riggs, 26, relies on Led Zeppelin, Sonic youth, Sound Garden, Big 
Black and Metallica -- and has "celebratory visions, to be bluntly honest," 
about L.A. coming down in a quake. "I came here from Minnesota, so I actually 
enjoy earthquakes. I'm one of those few people who actually kind of like 
surfing around bedrooms." Then, clearly remembering that he's speaking for 
publication, he adds that "watching out for flying glass and making sure your 
kids are covered is always more important." 
</P>
<P>
 The other Timers -- Robb, Riggs, Debbie Wells, 24, Nick Scheckel, 26, Paul 
Roberts, 45, Helen Quan, 27, and Riley Geary ("just call me an Old Timer") -- 
have similar tricks to get them through boring shifts, and each bursts with 
stories about exciting ones -- shifts when they log more than earth burps. 
</P>
<P>
 But Geary, a 10-year veteran, has the best: His saga began the day before the 
Northridge quake, when took a long bike ride that included a bloody crash and 
ended at 2 a.m. "I got all of about two hours of sleep when Northridge hit," he 
says. Riley rode into work and "plopped myself down on one of these chairs 
here, still oozing blood. I ended up staying here 27 hours. At the end of the 
day, I stuck to the chair." Michael R. Forrest

LADY DEATH AND ALIENS FROM THE PLANET ZAROS; AN AGING AUTHOR AND HIS AGING 
DETECTIVE KEEP A DATE WITH DEMISE; PULP, BY CHARLES BUKOWSKI (BLACK SPARROW 
PRESS: $25, CLOTH; $13, PAPER; 202 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dick Lochte, Dick Lochte's latest mystery novel, Blue Bayou, is available in 
Ivy paperback. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Private eye Nick Belane sits in his sleazy downtown L.A. office, alone and 
lonely. It's hot outside and his air conditioner is on the fritz. His rent is 
overdue. He looks at a fly crawling across the top of his desk. Ever since the 
prime of Raymond Chandler, and probably long before that, fictional private 
eyes have been sitting at their desks, sweating and studying flies. But 
"Pulp's" Belane is a little different. A woozily parodic creation of the 
swirling mind of the late writer-poet Charles Bukowski, he is both earthier and 
more fanciful than his predecessors. And his pursuits are certainly more 
literary. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Chandler's Philip Marlowe (in the novel "The Little Sister") uses 
a swatter on his fly, then picks the insect up daintily by one wing and 
deposits it into a wastebasket. Belane smashes his with his bare hand and, 
barely pausing to wipe the result onto his pants leg, he fields a call from a 
client. It's Lady Death. Not some television horror movie hostess, but the 
genuine article. She hires Belane to find Louis-Ferdinand Celine, who has been 
seen at a used book store searching for Faulkner first editions. The problem is 
that the French novelist died back in the '60s. And if that isn't enough to 
make a shamus swill all the sake in his bottom desk drawer, Lady Death is just 
the first of a series of clients with odd requests. 
</P>
<P>
 There's John Barton, who hires him to get a line on the elusive Red Sparrow, 
whatever it may be. And entrepreneur Jack Bass, who asks him to follow Mrs. 
Bass, the former Miss Chili Cookoff of 1990, who he thinks may be deceiving him 
with another man. And, strangest of all, there 4-foot-8 Hal Grovers, who wants 
him to get rid of the woman who's making his life a living hell, Jeannie Nitro, 
who just happens to be one of six space aliens from the planet Zaros here to 
settle down on our browning earth. 
</P>
<P>
 In true detective novel tradition, the cases are related. And in his own 
blunt, heavy-handed manner, Belane works his way through to their solutions. 
This makes for a whimsical and oddly charming (a word not often used in 
describing Bukowski's work) spoof. The literary allusions are amusing. John 
Barton is a stand-in for John Martin, the owner of Black Sparrow Press, his 
publisher of record. Celine was a novelist whose world view and use of argot 
probably made him a Bukowski favorite. Two dim leg-breakers are named Dante and 
Fante, the former probably a reference to the poet of "Divine Comedy" fame, the 
latter to John Fante who pioneered fictional studies of Hollywood's demimonde a 
bit before Bukowski. The explanation of the author's reason for depicting them 
as thugs I leave to better informed students of his work, along with any 
subtext to the rest of the cast of characters, including bookstore owner Red 
Kowldowsky, McKelvy the landlord and the treacherous beauty Deja Fountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Bukowski obviously wasn't out to bury the private detective genre with this 
playful pastiche. But he was toying with its conventions, with the smart talk 
and tough guy attitude. Probably of deeper import is the realization that, with 
all the boozy goofiness and slapstick whimsy of Belane's caper, this is very 
much an autobiographical work, a portrait of the aging author as an aging 
private eye, always on the case whether he is following up serious lines of 
inquiry or tossing away all his loot at Hollywood Park or in some dim bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pulp" was printed only months after his death last March at the age of 73. 
Though a few decades younger, Belane's sense of his own mortality is acute. 
Everywhere he looks he sees people and places he knew leaving the scene. And 
after he delivers Celine to Lady Death and she reclaims him, Belane and his 
client have this conversation: 
</P>
<P>
 "You haven't seen the last of me," the Lady said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, baby, can't we cut a deal?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's never been done, Belane." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, O.K., but how about giving me a date, you know, a D.O.D.?" 
</P>
<P>
 "What's that?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Date of Demise." 
</P>
<P>
 "What good would that do?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Lady, I could prepare myself." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every human should anyhow, Belane." 
</P>
<P>
 "Lady, they don't, they forget it, they ignore it or they're just too stupid 
to think it." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, he arrives at his moment of truth. "This can't be happening, I 
thought. This isn't the way it's supposed to happen." But it does, at a time 
when Belane has solved all of his cases. One hopes that Bukowski solved all of 
his, too.

STIRRING THE ASHES; MASTERS OF ILLUSION, BY MARY-ANN TIRONE SMITH (WARNER 
BOOKS: $21.95; 224 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Shepard, Jim Shepard is the author, most recently, of The Kiss of the 
Wolf. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Connecticut Circus Fire of 1944 is legendary in the history of that state, 
and with good reason. As a catastrophe it had the elements necessary for an 
unforgettable narrative: a sufficient magnitude of horror, an array of 
appalling attendant ironies and a tantalizing mystery at its heart. 
</P>
<P>
 On a hot July day of that year for reasons still debated a Barnum & Bailey's 
circus tent in Hartford caught fire, killing 169 people and injuring more than 
a thousand more, almost all women and children, since most of the men were 
overseas in the war. What was perhaps most horrifying about the story, as the 
details emerged, was how avoidable the disaster had been: Most of the victims 
had died, for example, because a steel animal chute parallel to the main 
entrance had not been disassembled; because it never occurred to people to 
simply go under the walls of the tent, instead of crowding toward the exit; and 
because, as makeshift waterproofing (at a time when the war effort had gobbled 
up all the waterproof canvas), the regular canvas had been painted with a 
solution of paraffin and gasoline. The result was a fire that consumed the 
biggest circus tent in the world (three city blocks long) in less than six 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 That historical fire is the central organizing event of Mary-Ann Tirone 
Smith's new novel, "Masters of Illusion." Smith, the author of three previous 
novels (including "The Book of Phoebe") here presents us with another story of 
investigation, in which the attempt to get at the truth of what happened that 
day is paralleled, first metaphorically and then literally, by the attempt to 
get to the bottom of a particular family's dysfunction. 
</P>
<P>
 The protagonist of "Masters of Illusion" is Margie Potter, the youngest child 
to survive the fire, who 18 years later marries Charlie O'Neill, a Hartford 
fireman obsessed with the disaster since his childhood. Charlie believes, 
almost alone, that the fire was deliberately set, and Margie becomes -- half 
helpmate, half bystander -- a party to his obsession with finding out the 
truth. As Charlie proceeds with his 25-year search, Margie, prodded by her 
annoyingly wise daughter Martha, comes to understand that she's proceeding with 
her own investigation into the sources of another disaster: the gradual 
collapse of her relationship with her husband. As the novel trundles along 
pretending to be principally about the circus fire, we come to understand that 
it's really more about a stifling marriage, the covert suffocating power of 
familial relationships, and the ways in which we ourselves can become, in terms 
of what we tell ourselves about the inner workings of our families, masters of 
illusion: self-hypnotists who repress one fact and invent another as a means of 
keeping our quotidian lives on an even keel. 
</P>
<P>
 The author portrays the circus fire as an event so traumatic it becomes for 
everyone connected with it an immense generator of repressive energies, and 
therefore of secrets. It's a psyche-wrecker of massive proportions, and 
Charlie, like a lunch-pail Freudian analyst, interviews survivor after survivor 
and allows them to unlock dark secrets that have been compelling their behavior 
in unsuspected ways all these years. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Alfred Hitchcock's "Spellbound" replayed again and again, the novel is 
then in the position of continually rehashing the events of the fire, an 
aesthetic problem it handles with dexterity, turning some details into terrible 
refrains and slowly releasing others as additional revelations, so that we see 
various aspects of the horror: the terrible panic; the pieces of burning 
canvas, falling everywhere as the paraffin and gasoline mixture created what 
was essentially napalm; the unspeakable smell; the band playing Sousa's "Stars 
and Stripes Forever" as both a coded alarm and an attempt to control panic. And 
some of the novel's images have the resiliency in memory of Holocaust photos: 
choking mothers, trapped by the steel chute, holding their children up to be 
saved; a mother and son at the bottom of the crush of bodies, afterward found 
alive but fused together by their burned flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 But the gradual turning away from Charlie's quest in favor of Margie's 
represents a net loss for the novel in terms of dramatic power, because 
Charlie's quest is truly obsessive, and therefore focused and driven, while 
Margie's seems more desultory, something that comes and goes over the years. 
Part of that has to do with Margie as a character. The book does an effective 
job of rendering the nagging sense she has of being outside of her own story 
(both in terms of her marriage and her infant's experience of the circus fire), 
but that affects the narrative, as well; especially in the book's middle 
section, there's an odd, emotionally disconnected feel to things that makes a 
short novel seem baggy. For long stretches Margie relates her story with less 
intensity and penetration than one would hope for, as though her unwillingness 
to push too far into disturbing implications is shared by the novel itself. The 
book at such points feels trapped by the daily-ness of her life; she mostly 
sits and thinks things through, while we sit helplessly beside her and follow 
along. 
</P>
<P>
 While all that thinking often displays a certain wry wisdom ("She'd gone back 
to her room to think. Twelve-year-olds do a lot of thinking, because no one 
ever tells them anything"), it also makes the book seem more and more static. 
As everyone spells out to themselves and each other what their problems are 
("Margie felt as if she were just like the wife of any alcoholic, putting up 
with abnormal behavior out of some sort of screwed-up version of love that 
looked like, and felt like, and smelled like loyalty, but was something else"), 
the book begins to sound like a self-help primer, with everyone suddenly adept 
at articulating the hidden wellsprings of their feelings: 
</P>
<P>
 "His face became full of the need to speak. He didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Charlie, tell me what you're feeling right now.' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'I don't know what I'm feeling.' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Yes, you do. Say it.' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Panic.' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'You're feeling panic right now?' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Yes.' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Tell me what panic is. I've never felt it.' 
</P>
<P>
 "His face changed. To his astonishment. Charlie was astonished that panic 
wasn't a common, everyday feeling. He said, 'It's the feeling you get when 
you're a small kid, and an adult is going to hurt you and there's no escaping.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 All of which, then, leaves the reader unsurprised when, in keeping with the 
therapeutic model, the principals are finally released by the novel's truth 
when the cause of the fire emerges. Their release is our disappointment. We 
feel the opportunity lost: a gifted writer, a compelling subject and a 
dauntingly complicated tangle of conflicts, all resolved into a too-neat 
bundle.

PALM LATITUDES: BEING THERE; MEA GOOFA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Keanu, 
</P>
<P>
 When I saw you promoting "Speed" on Letterman, bouncing in and out of your 
chair, hands drawing abstract figures in the air, I wondered if you had taken 
the title of your film a mite too literally. 
</P>
<P>
 I now know better. A TV interview turned me, too, into a squirming, babbling 
goof -- and I wasn't even on a network show. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth is, I'd always thought I would be able to handle an interview with 
aplomb. After all, I've done hundreds of interviews -- all, however, from the 
safe side of the reporter's note pad. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the producer of "Movie Madness," a weekly talk show on public access TV, 
saw me moderating a Learning Annex symposium on how movies get made and asked 
me to be a guest. (Screenwriting's my day job between journalism gigs. My 
projects include "Hobo Jungle" on HBO and "But Not A Drop to Drink" on CBS. I 
also pen a screenwriting column for the Writer's Journal.) 
</P>
<P>
 As the interview date neared, I found myself worrying about inane things -- 
like what color shirt to wear. I also prayed that my major assets (my knowledge 
of screenwriting) would shine through and that my liabilities (my lack of 
knowledge of screenwriting) would be finessed by my host, Don Abernathy.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, frankly, I prayed that I would not squirm like you did.  
</P>
<P>
 My prayers were in vain. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Abernathy wanted to take the show on location, I invited him to my 
sunny, un-air conditioned study. Big mistake. It was a hot afternoon, but we 
had to shut the windows to eliminate street noise while the TV lights made the 
study even hotter, brighter and more airless. I was quickly drowning in sweat. 
The director stockpiled an entire shelf with towels, ready to hand them to me 
between takes. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the camera rolled, Abernathy revealed hitherto unsuspected Mike 
Wallace-like characteristics, asking hardball questions, grilling me about 
contradictory opinions by screenwriting experts and tossing in an occasional 
goofy curveball to keep it all exciting. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the kind of interview I'd have love to have conducted -- but this time, I 
was at the receiving end. As I tried to answer questions in the complete 
sentences least likely to get mangled during the edits, my hands crashed into 
the mike, knocking it out. I bounced in and out of my chair. I tried to follow 
the director's instructions to look "sincerely" at the camera. When I saw the 
tape later, I looked like a speed freak trying desperately to come back to 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
 After the show, I thought about getting some professional coaching, even 
though producers aren't exactly knocking down my door to get me on TV. You 
might think about it, though. After all, you're a star. You need to look cool 
on TV. I'm a writer. I don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Sincerely, Joseph Hanania

 It was 24 years ago that L.A.'s center for all things metaphysical, the Bodhi 
Tree Bookstore, opened for business on Melrose Avenue. The brainchild of Stan 
Madson and Phil Thompson, engineers for Douglas Aircraft who were swept up in 
the social revolution of the '60s and were itching to get out of the aerospace 
industry, the store was launched (with a third partner, Dan Morris) with a 
modest nest egg of $18,000 and an inventory of 2,000 books. "Our clientele then 
was mostly made up of people from the hippie street community, but the audience 
for the material we carry has changed dramatically since then," says Stan 
Madson. "Everyone seems to have some interest in metaphysics now, and people 
from all walks of life come into the store." 
</P>
<P>
 The growing audience for metaphysics has led the Bodhi Tree to grow as well. 
Their original stock of 2,000 has expanded to 29,000 titles, they distribute a 
quarterly mail-order catalogue to 43,000 people around the world, and they've 
taken over the buildings on both sides of their original location. The building 
to the north houses their used-book branch, while the recently acquired 
building to the east is used for author events, musical recitals and workshops. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd been growing steadily since we opened," says Madson, "but when Shirley 
MacLaine published her book 'Out On a Limb' in 1983, our business doubled in a 
matter of days. In her book she talked about finding certain materials in our 
store, and when she did a TV series based on the book in 1987 parts of it were 
shot here. She struck a root with that book -- what she did basically was move 
metaphysics into the mainstream -- and publishers started putting out 10 times 
as many books on metaphysical subjects as they had before. Almost every city in 
America has a metaphysical bookstore today, and there are 15 of them in L.A. 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 With an inventory that encompasses everything from Buddhism and Eastern 
thought, Theosophy, homeopathy and the healing arts, literature and poetry, to 
the Tarot, astrology, witchcraft and ritual magic, the Bodhi Tree's area of 
interest is "anything that can act as a means of transforming the mind," says 
Madson. This is an endeavor that's subject to trend, and at the moment the 
trendiest metaphysical book is James Redfield's "The Celestine Prophesy" (which 
is stocked as fiction here). "That's been our bestseller for several months," 
says Madson. "Another big seller right now is 'The Artist's Way' by Julia 
Cameron." 
</P>
<P>
 Metaphysical fads come and go, but a handful of titles sell steadily year 
after year. "Books like 'Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind' by Suzuki Roshi, and 'The 
Secret Teachings of All Ages' by Manly Palmer Hall have sold well since our 
first day of business," says Madson. "We publish a booklet called 'A Basic 
Booklist for Metaphysical Inquiry' that lists about 600 titles and those books 
never go out of print." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to books, which are acquired at a rate of 1,000 new titles per 
year by head buyer Marc Labinger, the store also carries crystals, jewelery, 
500 types of incense, I Ching coins, oils, elixirs and other grooming products, 
Tibetan backpacks and aroma therapy items. It doesn't stock hard-core head-shop 
items such as hash pipes and bongs; the Bodhi Tree isn't about blowing your 
mind, rather, it sees itself as part of a venerated L.A. tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the diverse racial mix of Southern California, metaphysical 
movements have flourished here since the beginning of the century," says 
Madson. "Krishnamurti hung out here, Aimee Semple MacPherson was here, the 
Theosophical people had a lodge in the Larchmont area -- there've been various 
types of splinter groups here for a long time. This is no longer just an L.A. 
thing, though," he adds. "In the years since we opened the Bodhi Tree, the 
metaphysical community has exploded, and things that were once dismissed as 
'crackpot L.A. stuff' are taken seriously by people around the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bodhi Tree, at 8585 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood, is open seven days a 
week from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.

 LIFE WITH AN ELECTRIC CAR by Noel Perrin (Sierra Club Books: $12; 217 pp.) . 
When a student asked ecology professor Noel Perrin why he a drove gas-guzzling 
truck, he began to look for an electric car. He finally found one in 
California, but its limited cruising range and inability to climb steep hills 
complicated the trip home to Vermont. Perrin blends serious discussions of 
pollution with a personal account of his travels. His endearing, avuncular 
approach to questions of energy use will probably win more converts to the 
environmental cause than the confrontational stance of many authors who 
champion the movement.

 MEN ON MEN 5: Best New Gay Fiction edited by David Bergman (Plume/Penguin: 
$11.95; 347 pp., paperback original) . David Bergman has taken over editing 
this annual collection begun by the late George Stambolian.Not all the stories 
in this uneven anthology support his contention that gay fiction is "the most 
vital movement in American literature right now." On the plus side, Peter 
Cashorali's graceful "The Cemetery" depicts a young man confronting HIV and the 
shifting cultural mix of Los Angeles; Jameson Currier focuses on the "worried 
well" at the sidelines of the AIDS pandemic in the well-crafted "Fearless." The 
weaker stories all seem to revolve around impossibly fabulous people, including 
"Tricked," Robert Rodi's cliche tale of star-worship, and Raphael Kadushin's 
"Boys on Fire."

 EXIT INTO HISTORY: A Journey Through the New Eastern Europe by Eva Hoffman 
(Penguin: $11.95; 410 pp.) . Eva Hoffman, who was born in Cracow, roamed the 
countries of the former Eastern Bloc, observing the results of the recent 
governmental upheavals.Although she notes the political shifts in the capitals, 
Hoffman focuses on how the new regimes are affecting the daily lives of average 
citizens who have to find something for dinner and pay the rent. Rapid economic 
changes have produced resentment, ominous inter-ethnic friction, despair and 
anger, but also hope and joy. The often chaotic conditions offer opportunities 
that would have been unthinkable a few years ago: "Glossy and tacky at the same 
time. There's a Klondike sleaziness aspect to the new Eastern Europe, and the 
unregulated opportunism of a Wild East. . . . The woebegone trading posts of 
last year have burgeoned into this anarchic energy."

 ALIAS OLYMPIA: A Woman's Search for Manet's Notorious Model and Her Own Desire 
by Eunice Lipton (Meridian: $9.95; 181 pp.) . Art historian Eunice Lipton 
recounts her fascination with the elusive Victorine Meurent, the model who 
posed for "Olympia," "Le Dejeuner sur l'herbe" and other celebrated paintings 
by Manet. In an intriguing example of historical detective work, Lipton 
reconstructs Meurent's life from a scant array of documents and references. But 
the author seems to identify a little too strongly with her subject and builds 
a portrait of her as a painter without having seen a single canvas.

 SEX, ECONOMY, FREEDOM & COMMUNITY by Wendell Berry (Pantheon: $11; 177 pp.) 
Berry writes with his customary eloquence about the need to adopt an 
ecologically sane way of life; unfortunately, his reasoning seems less sound 
than his syntax.After damning multinational corporations for exploiting one 
region to benefit another, he defends American tobacco farmers who have caused 
thousands of deaths in Asia, Europe and South America. Berry grows so enchanted 
with his idyllic vision of self-sufficient rural communities that he forgets 
that small villages have frequently been centers of intolerance and ignorance. 
The notion that art should spur viewers to reassess ideas has no place in this 
Arcadia. Berry asserts: "The public, so far as I can see, has no right to 
require a community to submit to or support statements that offend it," 
ignoring how often this philosophy has caused anyone perceived as different to 
be subjected to ostracism, imprisonment and even death.

 MISSISSIPPI HISTORY by Steve Yarbrough (University of Missouri Press: $14.95; 
156 pp., paperback original). Blighted hopes hang in the humid air of 
Yarbrough's fictional Delta town of Indianola: In these stories men and women 
who hoped to make something of themselves watch their dreams fade into 
mediocrity. The narrators of "Hoe Hands" and "Hazel Baker" attain some insight 
into their lives, but they lack the resolution to act on it. The tantalizing 
memories of the potential they once had dogs the characters' steps, making it 
harder to trudge to work each morning.

<P>
 The smell of a brand-new sports car, the taste of a good tequila -- these are 
just two of life's little indulgences.But the feel of suede against the skin is 
something else. Suede is sumptuous, sensuous and, yes, sexy. The message it 
sends is subtle: I'm a touchable tough guy. Far from fragile, it's meant to be 
worn often and with abandon. So relax. Let your suede take a few hard knocks. 
It only gets better with age.

STYLE: GARDENS; BORDER CONTROL

<TEXT>
<P>
 The parkway, that miserable little strip of baked soil next to the street, is 
a gardening no man's land. It's the property of the city, the responsibility of 
the homeowner and a joy to neither.Often trampled and frequently mined with dog 
droppings and litter, the parkway is a tough place to grow anything other than 
gazanias or grass (the only thing some cities allow), and sometimes even those 
two stalwarts fail. 
</P>
<P>
 Not about to give up on their curbside garden, Phillip and Shirley Levine of 
Bel-Air hired designer Jack Wheeler of Woodland Hills for one last try. "They 
said I could do anything, but only once. They were tired of schemes that didn't 
work," he says. So after installing extra sprinklers to compensate for the 
greedy roots of gnarled old peppermint trees ( Agonis flexuosa ), he chose a 
luxuriant but low-maintenance mix of flowering shrubs and perennials, and 
treated the parkway like an English perennial border. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the shade, Wheeler used plants that need only a half-day or less of sun: 
white abutilons, sasanqua camellias and, surprisingly, cape mallow ( 
Anisodontea ). In front grow red coral bells, gray-green helichrysum and a pale 
pink-flowered true geranium named 'Biokovo', punctuated by clumps of grasslike 
Liriope 'Silver Dragon'. 
</P>
<P>
 A saucer magnolia, princess flower, kangaroo paws, lavatera, violet Lavandula 
multifida and purple Mexican sage thrive were there is considerably more sun. 
The trick, Wheeler says, was creating a seamless blend of the sun-loving and 
the shade-tolerant. Now about 3 years old, this lush and satisfying garden 
suggests that there are imaginative new ways to plant -- even on a parkway.

THE EFFECTS OF A BREAST CANCER STORY LINE ON LESLIE CHARLESON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY M. REICHARDT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "When I first started doing soaps -- ages ago -- we were restricted," says 
Leslie Charleson, who plays Monica Quartermaine on "General Hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't say words like abortion. You couldn't be political. You couldn't 
be topical. You couldn't cause any kind of controversy. I always felt that was 
a mistake. We're seen in people's living rooms, kitchens and bedrooms five days 
a week. We have a responsibility (to tackle) real issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps that's why Charleson, who has seen daytime "come a long way" since her 
debut in 1966, suggested her current "General Hospital" story: Monica's battle 
with breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pitched the story when Claire Labine first came on the show," says 
Charleson. "I thought it would be interesting to have a doctor go through 
something like this. To see how a doctor handled it or rather didn't handle it 
in Monica's case." 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we could get more information out about breast cancer, because -- 
being a doctor -- Monica would know more," she continues. "That's how it all 
started. Little did I know what I was getting into." 
</P>
<P>
 Charleson is referring to the toll the ongoing story has taken on her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very draining," she says, noting that by the end of a workday she feels 
as if she has "been run over by a truck. It starts as soon as I go into makeup. 
They put this pasty, white makeup on me. The hair is not done up. You're not 
all fluffed and folded. Then, I put on the rig that was made for not having one 
breast. It's like getting into a period costume. It changes your persona. 
Gradually, without doing much of anything, you get dragged down." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet she's more than willing to go through it all because it "raises people's 
awareness. That's what I hope to convey first and foremost. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been amazing to me and a bit overwhelming to have people come up to me 
and say they are very moved by something I've done and that they have lost 
someone to breast cancer," she says. "I think that's when the impact started; 
the idea that I'm being scrutinized by anyone who has known someone who has 
gone through something like this. In that respect the whole story has taken on 
a bit more depth." 
</P>
<P>
 Charleson prepared for the story by reading material on the subject. She 
visited the Wellness Community with Labine and "General Hospital" executive 
producer Wendy Riche. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was founded by Harold Benjamin in 1984," says Charleson. "His wife 
contracted cancer; she is a survivor. As a result, he started a support center 
for survivors. We talked to five women about their experiences and gained quite 
a bit of insight." 
</P>
<P>
 Charleson is proud of this story, which heats up this month -- National Breast 
Cancer Month. She believes it has been handled to perfection by the "General 
Hospital" writers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monica is going through all the stages of cancer," she notes about how the 
story is unfolding. "You can't rush something like this. Otherwise it isn't 
real. It can't be that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Does Charleson anticipate her performance in this story line to be considered 
for a 1995 Daytime Emmy nomination? 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be lying through my socks, if I say, 'Gosh, I hope not,' " says 
Charleson. "I certainly hope so. I hope on the merit of Claire and Wendy we're 
right in there." 
</P>
<P>
 "General Hospital" airs weekdays at 2 p.m. on ABC.

OVER THE TOP; A MISHMASH OF INGREDIENTS AND TECHNIQUES MAKE FOR WILD AND CRAZY 
FOOD AT PARKWAY GRILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. Irene Virbila 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pasadena's foremost practitioner of California cuisine is Parkway Grill, where 
anything and everything goes, with ingredients and techniques thrown together 
in one exuberant jumble: sesame chicken salad on baby greens with sake, poached 
plums, snow peas and miso vinaigrette; tenderloin of pork with 
honey-lavender-port reduction served with smoked Maui onion and goat cheese 
dumplings. I read on, fascinated, trying to imagine how these dishes would 
taste.  
</P>
<P>
 When this brash newcomer opened in 1984, it took some persuading to get 
Pasadena's old guard to try the trendy Spago clone. Ten years later, Parkway 
Grill is a fixture on the scene, its big, brick-walled dining room filled even 
on weeknights with businessmen, young couples, local hipsters and the 
well-heeled. 
</P>
<P>
 At night, lights twinkle in the trees out front. Inside, the barn-like space, 
defined with Corinthian pillars, is decked out in polished brass, earth tones 
and forest green. The requisite open kitchen is placed stage center, so that 
the wood-burning pizza oven is the first thing you see when you enter.  
</P>
<P>
 Seated in a quiet corner one night, we study the long menu and have just about 
decided what to order when our waitress begins to recite the specials. As she 
reels off ingredient after ingredient, I struggle to hold each wacky dish in my 
mind. "Herb fettuccine tossed in wild mushroom-ginger-chile-garlic-miso sauce, 
garnished with yellow bell peppers and green beans and topped off with lightly 
breaded, Japanese spiced, whole deep-fried soft-shelled crab!" Yikes! It sounds 
so weird, I have to order it. And when it comes, it sort of works -- for a 
once-in-a-lifetime taste sensation. Though it's impossible to detect any of the 
khaki pasta's touted herbs through the complex, heat-laden sauce, the 
soft-shell crab is beautifully fried.  
</P>
<P>
 Another night, another waiter with a prodigious memory. Here comes herb 
fettuccine again, this time in a tomato sauce, "sauteed in butter with some 
Cabernet and topped with Kona crab meat, zucchini and wild mushrooms, garnished 
with two shiitake mushrooms stuffed with goat cheese. . . ." My friend Maria, 
in from New York, listens to all this, eyes rolling. She asks him to repeat the 
pasta. He's letter perfect. "It sounds a little . . . weird," she comments.  
</P>
<P>
 "You're more of a basic person then," he says sympathetically. Undaunted, he 
proceeds to ask a couple of nearby customers what they thought of the special. 
One nay. One aye. Maria orders the dish -- and regrets it. The tomato-Cabernet 
sauce is too soupy to cling to the pasta; the garnish of shiitake stuffed with 
gooey goat cheese is truly awful. Another pasta is a horrible, sodden mass of 
noodles weighed down with brownish Cabernet-chile sauce garnished with a row of 
overcooked, sweetish shrimp. Inedible. 
</P>
<P>
 So many of Parkway Grill's dishes are overwrought, with wildly disparate 
ingredients in excess, the menu begins to sound like a parody of California 
cuisine. Do the cooks ever read these descriptions aloud? The irony is that 
with all that's going on in these dishes, the result is mostly dull. Every so 
often, though, a dish balances all the competing elements, like the 
straightforward and good Dungeness crab tostadas topped with rough-cut salsa 
and guacamole or the more baroque cocoa crepe folded around a nicely cooked 
lobster filling and served with a rich, well-modulated lobster sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Pizzas are by far the best things on the menu -- when not overladen with 
topping. I like the oval three-section pizza, divided into zones, each with its 
own discrete topping of just three or four ingredients, such as artichokes, 
sweet red peppers and mushrooms. The pizza loaded with house-made Italian 
sausage, red onions and sweet peppers is a good bet, too. But the calzone goes 
overboard with too many ingredients, all of them overwhelmed by sharp, 
raspberry-vinegared onions.  
</P>
<P>
 Better stick with the simpler-sounding entrees like grilled swordfish with 
saffron risotto and a relish of olive, roasted pepper and mint or the Sonoma 
baby lamb with morel mushrooms and -- uh-oh -- foie gras Pinot Noir sauce. The 
chef just can't seem to leave well enough alone, adding one last element that 
takes a dish well over the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts are big, bold and oh-so-sweet. Cobbler isn't cobbler at all, but more 
of a crisp, excruciatingly overdosed with sugar. I wrestled one night with a 
gigantic caramel and chocolate tart, really a grown-up candy bar. The tart won. 
</P>
<P>
 After dinner at Parkway Grill, another friend, an American who grew up in 
Paris, shakes his head in bemusement. "This is really wild and crazy California 
cuisine. My palate doesn't know what to do." Neither does mine. 
</P>
<P>
 Parkway Grill, 510 S. Arroyo Parkway, Pasadena; (818) 795-1001. Smoking in 
bar. Dinner for two, food only, $34-$81. Corkage, $5.

ON THE RECORD: WHAT? THE SAME OLD SONG AGAIN?

<P>
 Not for today's column the usual evaluations of new recordings. Rather, dark 
thoughts on how much of the same thing is issued each month. "Commentary," if 
you will. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently I picked up another Times, New York's, and found a page dense with 
reproductions of the covers of five almost simultaneously released CDs of 
Rachmaninoff's Second Symphony. The accompanying article would surely deal with 
the horrors of recorded multiplication, nyet ?; wry commentary on how certain 
compositions are breeding like rabbits, with others, that were once relative 
rarities -- Rocky Two among them -- headed in the same direction. 
</P>
<P>
 But no, it wasn't a call for the industry to start practicing birth control. 
It was a "comparative review," as we used to call the process when publications 
for record mavens proliferated in the land. I'm incapable of that -- i.e., 
exhaustive listening to five recordings of the same hour-long thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor do I possess the requisite passion for and skill at determining the 
expressivity inherent in that timpani thwack in measure 67 as filtered through 
the sensibility of Maestro A vs. that of Maestro B (and, in this instance, D, E 
and F). Call me a big-picture person. Or lazy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of classical CDs are issued every month. Within this presumed bounty 
inevitably lurks worthwhile, underexposed repertory as well as necessary 
interpretive updating to suit certain current stylistic trends. More arcanely, 
there will be the occasional valid performance based on a new edition, with 
actual differences in the notes being played. 
</P>
<P>
 My inspiration, so to speak, for tackling this subject -- before I'd seen that 
page in the New York Times -- was the arrival of a mere four new recordings of 
Berlioz's "Symphonie Fantastique" within a two-week span, four added to the 
50-plus of that presumed pillar of the repertory already listed in the Opus 
catalogue. (One has to wonder what they put into the feed of the A&R people.) 
All that money being spent to stuff the catalogue, as if it were a Strasbourg 
goose. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when the poor bird gets overstuffed, it produces a valuable, edible 
product. Please, no protests yet: This is not intended as endorsement of the 
barbaric pate-making process -- and I don't eat liver, anyway. End of poultry 
metaphor. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhetorical question: Where are the customers for all those recordings of the 
"Symphonie Fantastique"? To state the matter in the most hyperbolic terms: What 
we have here is oversupply for nonexistent demand. 
</P>
<P>
 You might think my commentary is intended as a blast at the industry majors 
for ignoring non-standard repertory. Not quite. 
</P>
<P>
 For, although there remains worthy material that's unrecorded, or awaits 
recorded justice, there have been innumerable pleasant surprises in recent 
years -- being specific would require more space than I'm accorded in several 
months -- hardly less frequently from the industry giants than from the 
presumably enterprising little people. No, my larger worry concerns what this 
multiplication is doing to the majors' finite (reason dictates) classical 
budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 The recording companies state that they have to keep refreshing the old 
favorites by redoing them with putatively hot artists and/or up-to-date 
technology -- today, 20-bit Supermapping (Overbiting?), or whatever the latest 
unfathomable and who gives-a-damn wrinkle may be. 
</P>
<P>
 A better argument (which they use, but somewhat shamefacedly, when they'll 
talk to a journalist at all about figures) is that they owe it to a certain 
artist, who has labored long for them and brought in the bucks, to have another 
go at it -- because he or she has new thoughts on the subject. Fair enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet this isn't just about stars. Much of what is already over-recorded 
continues to come at us from musicians with little to offer either artistically 
or commercially. And, anyway and finally (for now), how many meaningful 
variants can you wrench from or impose on the same set of notes? At a certain 
point -- long before we've reached the number 50 -- we stop caring. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, the head of one of the major labels predicted a "great 
shakeout" in the industry, predicated on just such overkill. He and his company 
thereupon proceeded to give us music with which the market was super-saturated 
long before: the six Tchaikovsky symphonies twice , from the same conductor 
(OK, two different orchestras, but still). 
</P>
<P>
 And I could cite similar, if not as egregiously unnecessary, outpourings from 
the competition. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Duck! 
</P>
<P>
 It's the UPS man with another Mendelssohn Violin Concerto! The third in as 
many weeks -- I swear -- to slake consumer cravings unsatisfied by the 55 
(excluding arrangements for flute) already in the catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 In other businesses, putting out too much product results in wrist slaps and, 
eventually, the spigot's being turned off. Somebody up there eventually notices 
when big money is involved. 
</P>
<P>
 So what worries me is the specter of the money supply being more drastically 
curtailed than even this headily out-of-control situation warrants, with the 
worthwhile losing out along with the superfluous. 
</P>
<P>
 C'mon, big guys, practice a little abstinence.

POP EYE: IS THE WORLD STILL LISTENING?; A 10TH-ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION OF THE 
RECORDING OF 'WE ARE THE WORLD' IS SCHEDULED FOR JANUARY.

<P>
 We're barely done with Woodstock '94 and already there are plans for another 
anniversary reunion: USA for Africa '95. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones, Lionel Richie and Tina Turner are among those 
expected to be on hand Jan. 30 at the A&M Records lot in Hollywood for a 
10th-anniversary celebration of the recording of "We Are the World," the song 
written by Jackson and Richie to benefit African famine relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Recorded Jan. 28, 1985 by an all-star cast (including Bruce Springsteen, Diana 
Ross, Stevie Wonder and Bob Dylan) in an all-night session following the 
American Music Awards telecast from the Shrine Auditorium, the song helped 
raise more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Kragen, one of the project's original organizers, hopes that the reunion 
will rekindle that spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The legacy we want to leave was that what we did worked, it wasn't enough (to 
end hunger), but it did work," says Kragen, who managed Kenny Rogers and 
Richie, among others, at the time. "We want to say to people that you can do 
something to save lives." 
</P>
<P>
 The reunion will again follow the American Music Awards telecast, and that 
show will itself feature a tribute to USA for Africa, likely including 
appearances by some of the original performers. Kragen says that other events 
planned to mark the occasion include a worldwide simultaneous radio broadcast 
of "We Are the World" and a one-hour television special recapping the recording 
session and showing how the funds have been spent.  
</P>
<P>
 Kragen says that the last of those funds will be distributed to a variety of 
charities that night. 
</P>
<P>
 But with all those stars at a recording facility, won't someone get them to do 
a new song? 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no plans at the moment, but you never can tell," says Kragen. "But 
that's not the objective of this. The objective is to use the anniversary to do 
some positive good. This was a success . . . and we want to draw attention to 
what else is going on out there and let people know the process will work."

 MORE AID: "We Are the World" was part of a triumvirate of landmark, 
high-profile pop charity events a decade ago. It followed a like-minded English 
session, "Do They Know It's Christmas," recorded by Band Aid, an all-star 
session spearheaded by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, and was in turn followed in 
the summer of '85 by the twin Live Aid concerts in London and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 So what about plans for the 10-year anniversaries of Band Aid and Live Aid? 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, it seems that there are none. A London spokeswoman for Geldof 
says that the musician considers Band Aid and Live Aid part of the past and is 
frustrated that it has overshadowed all else in his career. London-based 
concert promoter Harvey Goldsmith, who organized the Live Aid concert there, 
was unavailable, but apparently is not planning any anniversary events. 
</P>
<P>
 Stateside, promoters and artist representatives say that there's been no talk 
of a Live Aid anniversary event, with several stating that it would be 
impossible to undertake such a project without Bill Graham, the concert 
promoter who marshaled the U.S. Live Aid event. Graham died in a helicopter 
crash three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Perloff, now president of Bill Graham Presents, says that the music 
industry's charitable side is still strong, but that circumstances are not such 
that a massive event like Live Aid could happen at this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done more benefit shows this year than I can ever remember," Perloff 
says. "But to bring everyone together like that you need something going on at 
such an emergency level that people get involved."

 OFF THE AIR: Santa Monica public radio station KCRW-FM (89.9) has canceled 
"The Reggae Beat" and "The African Beat," shows that for years were 
cornerstones of the station's eclectic music schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 C.C. Smith, who hosted "The African Beat" for its 11 years, says that she was 
notified of the termination by mail Oct. 19 in a letter from station manager 
Ruth Seymour, citing fallen ratings and stating that the action was "effective 
immediately."Listeners were not even given that notice -- no mention was made 
on the air or in the station's monthly newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 KCRW music director Chris Douridas says that the changes are part of an 
ongoing move away from specialized "block" programming and that reggae and 
African music will continue to be a large presence in other shows, including 
his own weekday "Morning Becomes Eclectic" and Liza Richardson's new 
alternative-music slot, replacing the reggae and African shows on weekend 
afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who also edits the world music magazine the Beat, fears that those 
music styles will get lost in the mix. "Our shows had penetrated deeply (in the 
reggae and African communities) and shutting us down now doesn't make sense," 
she says. Steve Hochman

 * * Brandy, "Brandy," Atlantic. A teen-age newcomer with surprisingly mature 
chops, Brandy imbues the hit single "I Wanna Be Down" with self-assured 
authority.Elsewhere on this debut effort, she's saddled with drab, subpar songs 
that don't do her justice. Forget maturity -- Brandy's too young to be mired in 
this mellow a mode.

 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three

RECORD RACK: NIRVANA LAID BARE, WITH NO APOLOGIES

 "MTV Unplugged in New York" 
</P>
<P>
 Geffen  
</P>
<P>
 * * * 
</P>
<P>
 Because this is an acoustic album, thirtysomething-and-older rock fans may 
assume that it's their best introduction to the late Kurt Cobain and the best 
chance to decide whether there is any truth to the talk of his being a 
Lennon-like spokesman for the restless '90s generation. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection, however, isn't such an easy bridge between rock generations. 
</P>
<P>
 In moving away from the aggressive assault that made the band's studio albums 
sometimes impenetrable to unsympathetic ears, Cobain wasn't trying to make his 
songs more accessible in this late '93 broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 He wanted chiefly to explore other sides of his music in this softer, 
stripped-down setting and, crucially, to introduce his audience to music by 
other songwriters who had given him inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 Figuring that everyone had heard enough of such hits as "Smells Like Teen 
Spirit" and even "Heart-Shaped Box," Cobain devoted almost half his time on the 
show to songs by other writers. There is something to be learned from the six 
tunes, including three by the Arizona trio the Meat Puppets. 
</P>
<P>
 First, you are touched by the generosity of spirit of someone who chooses to 
use the national platform to salute others rather than plug his own product. 
And it's hard for anyone who knows of Cobain's own troubled background not to 
be moved by the way so many of his favorite songs speak about the search for 
self-identity and comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Unplugged's" most revealing moment is in the version of "All Apologies," 
a song from 1993's "In Utero" album and perhaps Cobain's most naked expression 
of alienation and doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 What's striking is the absence of self-pity in his voice, whose tone suggests 
simply an artist conveying his feelings, free of either a shield that hides the 
emotional scars or a false bravado that tries to exploit them. 
</P>
<P>
 "MTV Unplugged" (which includes two songs that weren't in the telecast) offers 
a valuable glimpse into the soul of an artist, but it is Nirvana's studio 
collections, notably "Nevermind" and "In Utero," that remain the essential 
expressions of Cobain's art and the beginning points in connecting with it. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 TOM PETTY 
</P>
<P>
 "Wildflowers" 
</P>
<P>
 Warner Bros.  
</P>
<P>
 * * * 
</P>
<P>
 A bit of a wildflower himself, Petty has rerooted himself away from the 
12-string roots-rock he staked his career on.This marks his third straight 
album in a more stark and somber -- yet occasionally more mirthful -- mode 
(although Rick Rubin replaces Jeff Lynne as co-producer). Petty's adventuresome 
recent feel is less Byrds, more whippoorwill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wildflowers" is inconsistent, and doesn't offer any new songs that rank with 
Petty's greatest. Yet the mixture he's going for here has such an interesting, 
subtle kind of resonance you may not bemoan the lack of instant anthems. His 
trademark lately seems an odd combo of cool whimsy and sadness -- so that while 
the kids sing along with the "Let's roll another joint" chorus of "You Don't 
Know How It Feels," it's the "I've got a little space to fill" throwaway line 
that seems more the point. And while "It's Good to Be King" may have been 
suggested by Mel Brooks, those doleful Michael Kamen strings that end it tell 
us it's tough to be king or just a regal wanna-be. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15 tracks are heavy on soothingly lamentful ballads, though enough of 
Petty's usual band turns up on this "solo" album to make "You Wreck Me" a 
typically propulsive Heartbreakers rocker and "Honey Bee" buzz like Beatlesque 
metal. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 The Black Crowes speak the language of '70s rock, but they're more than an 
echo of the past. The Atlanta band has taken a load of lumps for its spirit of 
retro-decadence, but here they are -- still standing proud in their 
flare-bottoms and with a third album that masterfully mixes up slinky guitar 
riffs and soulful vibes. 
</P>
<P>
 The songs are solid and lively, ranging from the stepping-out strut of "High 
Head Blues" to the confessional mega-ballad "Cursed Diamond," and on through to 
the back-porch twang of "Downtown Money Waster." Even better are the sounds -- 
the music often becomes a playfully intense tangle of guitars, keyboards and 
percussion in support of singer Chris Robinson's fervent self-examinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's themes range from the somewhat spiritual to the decidedly carnal, 
and the band's ever-shifting sprawls of sound give each tune a powerfully 
distinct feel. Though the Crowes can still annoy just as much as they gratify, 
"Amorica" is an undeniably accomplished work. Dated fashions and snotty poses 
aside, the album's an engaging and exhilarating celebration of the rock 'n' 
roll groove. The attitude remains the same, but the music's gotten better. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

mostly rap tracks either on or inspired by the soundtrack for an unreleased, 
20-minute movie directed by Dr. Dre.Though the three cuts featuring Snoop Doggy 
Dogg are the reason the album debuted at No. 1, they're just so-so. The 
hard-driving Dre-Ice Cube collaboration "Natural Born Killaz" is the best cut. 
Other strong ones: Young Soldierz' "Eastside Westside" and Jodeci's "Come Up to

horde of demons to wrestle.Fueled by a fiery intellect and fierce instrumental 
support, his musical exorcisms are as enticing as they are grim. "Youthanasia" 
seethes with the usual pungent guitar, strafing riffage and relentless rhythms 
infused with a covert melodiousness. Mustaine's vocals seem earthier, which 
enhances his forbidding commentaries about society's (and his own) fatal flaws.

 * 1/2 Various artists, "The Glory of Gershwin," Mercury. If you always wanted 
to hear Jon Bon Jovi jam on George Gershwin, then: a) this is the album for 
you; and b) you are one sick puppy.A few guests -- Elvis Costello, Kate Bush, 
Peter Gabriel, Robert Palmer -- do some justice to the great composer on this 
17-track tribute, which is also a collaboration with 80-year-old harmonica 
player Larry Adler. But producer George Martin has little imagination about how 
to merge his guests' gifts with Gershwin's. New albums are rated on a scale of 
one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars (good) and four stars 
(excellent).

 LUCAS, "Lucacentric" ( Big Beat/Atlantic )*** 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing else on this album quite reaches the level of giddy inventiveness 
showcased on the exuberant first single, "Lucas With the Lid Off," an ode to 
mental freestyling that blends hip-hop and swing for an infectious twist on the 
hip-hop/jazz union. 
</P>
<P>
 Its lyrical theme of smashing through self-constructed barriers is echoed in 
the production's gleeful crashing of musical genres, making it one of the 
year's best singles.Elsewhere, familiar hip-hop themes (forging an identity, 
striving for cross-cultural unity, etc.) are dealt with in grooves that coolly 
juggle ragged rhythms, hip-hop beats, thumping bass, jazzy piano and R&B 
flourishes. 
</P>
<P>
 On his 1991 debut, "To Rap My World Around You," Lucas was marketed as a 
pretty boy doing pop-rap. In reality, he's an inventive talent capable of 
stunning flows of imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to four stars (excellent).

knight errantry and errant knights is the creme de la creme of Danny Kaye 
(pictured). Even Errol Flynn might have envied Kaye: jousts and jests are 
juggled jauntily, swashes are buckled and unbuckled swashingly, and Kaye's toes 
and tongue were never livelier.All together now: "The pellet with the poison's

 THE NEW GEORGE SHEARING QUINTET 
</P>
<P>
 "That Shearing Sound" 
</P>
<P>
 Telarc  
</P>
<P>
 * * * 
</P>
<P>
 It's been 20 years since Shearing first recorded his patentable "sound," an 
urbane front-line blend of vibes, guitar and piano that, it's interesting to 
note, was suggested to the pianist in 1947 by the late Leonard Feather. This 
elegant amalgam inspires thoughts of Polynesian sunsets, perfect dry martinis 
and whispered intimacies, and it is quite refreshing to hear once again. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Shearing employed everyone from vibists Margie Hyams and Charlie 
Shoemake to guitarists Joe Pass and Toots Thielemans, but here he uses mostly 
new (for him, at least) faces: guitarist Louis Stewart, vibist Steve Nelson, 
drummer Dennis Mackrell and his current bassist, Neil Swainson. To its credit, 
this crack crew plays like a band, not a pickup group. 
</P>
<P>
 The material is typical of Shearing -- light and easy on the ears yet still 
classy and extremely musical. "East of the Sun" and "Lullaby of Birdland" are 
two of the old favorites, while Horace Silver's subtly grooving "Strollin' " 
and Bill Evans' quietly opulent "Very Early" add modern flair. Among the 
standards are "Autumn Serenade," done almost as a rumba, and "Girl Talk," taken 
at a relaxed crawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Shearing is first-rate, his notes like chains of luminescent globes, his 
chordal clusters graceful and effervescent. Stewart adds deftly turned blues 
ideas to otherwise seamless statements; Nelson delivers fat-toned, flowing 
lines, and Swainson and Mackrell are the epitome of understated accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars 
(good, recommended), four stars (excellent).

 COVER UP: Glenn Danzig had the best of intentions in designing a plastic-free, 
environment-friendly cover for "4," the new CD by his band Danzig. It cost him 
and American Recordings a reported $250,000 each to manufacture the cover. 
</P>
<P>
 But he should have checked with record stores first. The special cover doesn't 
fit the plastic security "keepers" many stores use to prevent theft, and some 
have elected not to carry the album at all or to keep it behind the counter, 
out of view of potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Danzig, who plays the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre on Monday, has now abandoned 
the plan for the next pressing of the album, which will be housed in a more 
conventional Digipak, which uses less plastic than the common jewel box case, 
but still much more than Danzig wanted. Steve Hochman

requiring them to answer trivia questions about Hole before she'll sign. If you 
don't give the right answer, all she writes is "(Expletive) you" -- which some

 This Emmy-winning, comical, bulbous 1993 cable production offers new evidence 
of TV's crime gluttony, and HBO's intent to redefine some docudrama as farce. 
It's a dark-comedy version of a case in which the mom, Wanda Holloway (Holly 
Hunter, left), hopes to get a spot for her daughter on the high school 
cheerleading team.And she hopes to do it by allegedly having the mother of a 
rival killed. The film is tailor-made (by writer Jane Anderson) for Michael 
Ritchie, a director noted for movies that depict the dark side of competition: 
"Downhill Racer," "The Candidate" and "Smile." Beau Bridges (right), as the 
shady Terry Harper, and Swoosie Kurtz, as his disturbed wife, steal the show 
(HBO Monday at 5:15 a.m.). Howard Rosenberg

 Centered on an imaginary friendship between two 17th-Century composers, Marin 
Marais and M. de Sainte Colombe, this French film is a beautiful, sensual 
period piece. It's full of fine music, and it's a big, juicy star vehicle for 
Gerard Depardieu (who shares the role of Marais with his son Guillaume, left), 
Jean-Pierre Marielle (as Colombe) and Anne Brochet (right, as Colombe's 
daughter Madeleine). Director Alain Corneau and writer Pascal Quignard turn the 
lives of these people (of which little is actually known) into a fable about 
artistic integrity and compromise as the ascetic St. Colombe and his 
opportunistic, amoral protege Marais inevitably come to a parting of the ways

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; THE LIFE AND TIMES OF DARYL MITCHELL HELP MAKE 
'LARROQUETTE' GO 'ROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Daryl (Chill) Mitchell of NBC's "The John Larroquette Show" has found that his 
own life translates well on screen. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, when Mitchell was working as a musician and deejay, he met Reginald 
and Warren Hudlin, brothers in search of a movie concept for rappers Kid N' 
Play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to them about how a group of us got together, played music and 
rapped at parties," Mitchell recalls, on a break from "Larroquette." "And they 
decided that's what their movie should be about." The Hudlins' movie evolved 
into 1990's successful "House Party" (Reginald directed and Warren produced). 
</P>
<P>
 On the set of "Larroquette," where he plays angry lunch-counter vendor Dexter, 
more of Mitchell's stories about his past have found their way into the series' 
scripts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can say, 'This stuff happened to me, but it was like this . . . ' and 
they'll put it in," he says. "You can write it, but if you can't feel it or 
relate to it, you won't really know it. But when I can talk about my life and 
it gets in, it works good." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite what he calls a "rough" childhood growing up in Long Island, Mitchell 
says he's never as angry as Dexter. "For me, when things got negative, I fought 
back in a positive way. Dexter's anger is a cop-out, a way to pass the buck, 
blame someone else. No one's forcing him to stay there. He controls his 
destiny. But I think he's gonna start maturing and growing." 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up, Mitchell was grateful to rest on the laurels of his three older 
brothers' tough reputations. "It was a rough time. I have five siblings, but my 
father had a total of 14 kids, and at one time we all lived together." 
</P>
<P>
 He searched for activities outside the home: "Where I grew up, we didn't have 
Little League or football, or anything like that. Rap is the Little League of 
the ghetto." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's interest in hip-hop grew when his friends got together to rap. "We 
had the hip-hop thing," he explains. Acknowledging it sounds like the old '40s 
"Let's put on a show" movie mentality, he explains: "We got a crew together of 
20 kids who pitch in and buy equipment, form a crew, do parties and rap in 
people's back yards." 
</P>
<P>
 That crew evolved into the three-man rap groove group Groove B. Chill, which 
eventually put out two records. While the group no longer performs as an act, 
they produce music together. Currently, Mitchell is producing three other acts: 
a solo R&B artist, a "girl group" and a rap artist. 
</P>
<P>
 His own music remains constant and he'll soon return to it as a solo 
performer. "I've been reluctant," he says. "First, my acting career took off, 
and second, rap music took a turn into a gangster profile and that's not me. I 
listen to it, there's something to be said there, but it's not me. It would be 
like me trying to do ... salsa!" 
</P>
<P>
 He likes to listen to what he doesn't perform: "I even listen to opera. I 
don't know a word they're saying, but I like the way it sounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell says he'll patiently wait until his own melodic rap style comes back: 
"Everything has its time. Once it goes back to my flavor, then it's my time 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 It's certainly his time on television, says "Larroquette" creator and 
executive producer Don Reo. "He's a natural and one of my favorite actors in 
the whole world. He has this ability to take what we write and make it real and 
believable and honest. And he's a really nice person to work with," Reo says. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, Mitchell appears in the Hudlins' "Cosmic Slop" on HBO. "It's 
crazy," he says of the show, "like 'Twilight Zone,' but really out there." 
</P>
<P>
 And next month he begins shooting the feature "Quiet Time in Hollywood," about 
a youth's tough time growing up on the streets of Hollywood. Alluding to his 
own youth, he says, "Ah, it's all the same, what's happening in Hollywood is 
happening everywhere. It happens in New York, South Carolina, all over." 
</P>
<P>
 "The John Larroquette Show" airs Tuesdays at 9:30 p.m. on NBC. "Cosmic Slop" 
airs Nov. 8 at 10 p.m. on HBO.

RETRO; RETURN OF THE SHORT TIMERS; SERIES THAT DIDN'T LAST MORE THAN A SEASON 
GET A SECOND SHOWING ON TNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A television series can fail for many reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be the time slot. Or sometimes networks don't give a series a chance 
to find an audience. Often it's simply bad scripts, directing or acting. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't count the already canceled completely out: This month TNT it 
devoting its 11 a.m. weekday movie slot to several TV series that lasted one 
season or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Kicking off this festival of sorts Monday is "Hawkins," starring the venerable 
James Stewart. "Hawkins" originally aired on CBS from October, 1973, to 
September, 1974; it rotated with "Shaft" and "The New CBS Tuesday Night 
Movies." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its limited run, "Hawkins" is fun to watch, thanks to Stewart's 
enjoyable turn as Billy Jim Hawkins, a former deputy district attorney now in 
private legal practice in West Virginia. Despite living in a small town, 
Hawkins attracted fancy clients and specialized in murder cases. Strother 
Martin co-starred as his cousin and investigative assistant, R.J. Hawkins. 
</P>
<P>
 On tap for the week of Nov. 7 are Gavilan and McClain's Law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gavilan," which aired for three months beginning in October, 1982, starred 
Robert Urich, Patrick Macnee and Kate Reid. Urich played Robert Gavilan, a 
former CIA agent who, though, a tad cynical, was eager to right wrongs. Now an 
inventor and consultant to the California's DeWitt Institute of Oceanography, 
Gavilan helped people in need, worked on underwater projects and managed to 
find time get involved in spy activities. He shared his Malibu house with Milo 
Bentley (Macnee), a charming travel agent who helped out Gavilan. Reid played 
Marion Jaworski, Gavilan's boss at the institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "McClain's Law" starred "Gunsmoke's" James Arness in his only contemporary 
series. The police drama aired on NBC from Nov. 20, 1981, to Aug. 24, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Arness played Jim McClain, a former police officer who had retired 13 years 
earlier after a leg injury. Off the force, McClain worked as a fisherman and 
lived in a houseboat in San Pedro. After his fishing partner was robbed and 
murdered, McClain got himself reinstated so he could nab the killer. George 
DiCenzo played his new boss, Lt. DeNisco, and Marshall Colt was McClain's young 
partner, Harry Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven years before he joined "NYPD Blue," Dennis Franz was a regular on NBC's 
Chicago Story, which aired March to August, 1982. TNT will air five episodes 
the week of Nov. 14. The drama series focused on the lives of three groups of 
Windy City professionals -- doctors, lawyers and police officers. Maud Adams 
and Kristoffer Tabori were surgeons in a hospital's trauma unit. Vincent 
Bagetta played a public defender and Craig T. Nelson was a young assistant D.A. 
And Franz played -- what else? -- a cop. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before Jack Palance received his Oscar for "City Slickers," he starred in 
the 1975-76 CBS detective drama "Bronk." TNT will dust off the series the week 
of Nov. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bronk" found Palace playing a not-so-tough cop who was asked by an old friend 
(Joseph Mascolo), now a mayor of a Southern California town, to rid the town of 
corruption. Tony King played Bronk's assistant, Sgt. John Webber. 
</P>
<P>
 TNT rounds out the month with a week of "Shaft," beginning Nov. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1971 movie Shaft, starring Richard Roundtree and directed by Gordon Parks, 
was a huge hit that spawned two sequels, "Shaft's Big Score" and "Shaft in 
Africa," and the 1973-74 CBS series. 
</P>
<P>
 Roundtree reprised his movie role as the sexy, street-smart private eye in New 
York. In the series, though, his cases often took him away from the Big Apple. 
Ed Barth co-starred as Lt. Al Rossi, who would often supply Shaft with 
information. The series also used Isaac Hayes' Oscar-winning "Theme from 
'Shaft.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Hawkins" airs Monday-Friday at 11 a.m. on TNT; "Gavilan" airs Nov. 7-11 at 11 
a.m.; "McClain's Law" follows at noon; "Chicago Story" airs Nov. 14-18 at 11 
a.m.; "Bronk" airs Nov. 21-25 at 11 a.m. and noon; and "Shaft" airs Nov. 
28-Dec. 1 at 11 a.m.

FOCUS; CATCHING THE ACTING GENE

 Clark Gable may have been Vivien Leigh's leading man in "Gone With the Wind," 
but his son doesn't get anywhere with Shannen Doherty in "Burning Passion: The 
Margaret Mitchell Story," the bio of the author airing Nov. 7 on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 John Clark Gable, 33, plays a soldier who flirts with Doherty as "GWTW" author 
Margaret Mitchell, but frankly he has only five lines and her character doesn't 
give a damn. 
</P>
<P>
 The young Gable is one of a second generation of actors trying to make their 
mark in the shadow of their luminary parents. But while their pedigree may have 
helped get their foot in the door, they're on their own, playing roles that may 
not exactly be TV's choicest parts -- yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Grant, daughter of Cary Grant and Dyan Cannon, appears in the 
upcoming USA Network sitcom "Super Dave's Vegas Extravaganza," starring 
stuntman Dave Osborne. Natasha Gregson Wagner, the daughter of Natalie Wood, 
stars in the Nov. 12 remake of "The Shaggy Dog" on ABC. Jennifer Youngs, 
daughter of actor John Savage, plays the immigrant Ingrid in a recurring role 
on CBS' "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 They can look up to a handful of stars in prime time who have established 
their own careers. TV's long-running "Murphy Brown," Candice Bergen, grew up in 
the shadow of her father, ventriloquist Edgar Bergen, and his dummy, Charlie 
McCarthy. Tyne Daly and Tim Daly, children of the late distinguished actor 
James Daly, best known to TV audiences for "Medical Center," have both been in 
high-profile series. Tyne Daly co-starred in "Cagney & Lacey" from 1981 to '88 
and will soon be seen in the series' upcoming reunion movie on CBS; she 
currently co-stars in the midseason replacement "Christy." Tim Daly co-stars on 
"Wings," which has been on NBC since 1990. Adam Arkin, son of Alan Arkin, 
co-stars in the CBS drama "Chicago Hope" and earlier co-starred in "Big Wave 
Dave's" and "Northern Exposure" for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nepotism is a huge part of the entertainment industry," says Dom DeLuise's 
son Peter, 27, who joined the cast of "seaQuest DSV" this season along with his 
brother, Michael. "But once you get inside the casting office, if you can't 
prove yourself, you won't go anywhere. These people are spending a lot of 
money, and they are in no position to give people a free ride." 
</P>
<P>
 It was "seaQuest" executive producer Patrick Hasburgh -- who worked with both 
when they were on "21 Jump Street" on Fox -- who helped them snare spots on the 
submarine series. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter plays Dagwood, the sub's janitor, who comes from a genetically 
engineered race known as Daggers. Michael, 25, plays Tony Piccolo, a misfit who 
was physically altered in a scientific experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started making the rounds (in auditions), everyone expected me 
to be a younger version of my father," Peter DeLuise says. "They already had a 
preconceived notion. But I don't think I could come close to what he does. He's 
a master. What I do is special and different." 
</P>
<P>
 Having the DeLuise name "at one time was added pressure in an audition," says 
Michael DeLuise, 25, who also aspires to a career as a director. "It's 
something to live up to. Now I get a big kick out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 But both brothers -- who share an apartment near the Orlando, Fla., "seaQuest" 
set -- never considered any other career. As kids, their father would help them 
produce Super 8 home-movie spoofs of "Dracula" and "Robinson Crusoe," and gave 
them parts in some of his movies, including "Hot Stuff" and "Fatso." 
</P>
<P>
 "It represented fun to them," says Dom DeLuise. "They grew up seeing Burt 
Reynolds and my other friends, relaxed in front of the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Michael) was 7 years old and he said to me, 'I can't get an agent.' So he 
wrote this letter that said, 'I have talent. Give me 10%.' It was so sweet." 
</P>
<P>
 All of their careers converged last month, when the DeLuise patriarch 
guest-starred on the show as -- surprise, surprise -- Tony Piccolo's father. 
Another sibling, David, also had a part in the episode. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to smoke 12 cigars for the episode," Dom DeLuise says in a voice of 
mock indignation. "I did that for my sons." 
</P>
<P>
 "Diagnosis Murder" will soon be mixing generations as well. Carey Van Dyke, 
18, appears as an injured surfer with father Barry Van Dyke and grandfather, 
Dick Van Dyke, in a two-part episode Nov. 11 and 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty terrifying," says Van Dyke, a theatre arts major at Moorpark 
College. "(My dad) has been real encouraging. It was harder for him to grow up 
with the name than me. He just told me it goes with the territory." 
</P>
<P>
 And on an upcoming "Christy," Kathryne Brown, 23, appears with her mother, 
Tyne Daly, as a schoolteacher and romantic interest to LeVar Burton. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was nice to prove people wrong," says Brown, whose father is 
actor-director Georg Stanford Brown. "It was nice to have them say, 'Wow, she 
can do this. She's not here just because of her mom.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The stigma of getting special treatment was enough to make Miguel Ferrer hold 
off from an acting career until he was 24. The son of Jose Ferrer and singer 
Rosemary Clooney co-stars in "The Oksana Baiul Story," a Nov. 13 Hallmark 
"Sunday Afternoon Showcase" for CBS. "I was very much afraid of being made fun 
of, like, 'Here's another actor's kid, that's how he got the job.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "It finally got to the point where I said, 'Screw it; if they don't get it, so 
what?" says Ferrer, 39, who also played FBI agent Albert Rosenfield on ABC's 
cult favorite "Twin Peaks." 
</P>
<P>
 He admits to being intimidated by his father's thespian ability ("damn close" 
to a genius), but the elder Ferrer backed his decision to take acting classes. 
After several years of guest parts as heavies on such police dramas as "CHiPs" 
and "T.J. Hooker," he got his first big break in 1987's feature film "RoboCop," 
where he played a young executive who helped build the cyborg crime fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet when the movie first came out, his father seemed to ignore it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't see it until just before it left the theater," he says. "It was 
kind of a weird father-son thing. He went alone to an afternoon matinee. But I 
heard through other people that he really liked it. That's the way he was." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Joely Fisher of ABC's "Ellen" says she's proven herself. After 
studying musical theater at Emerson College in Boston, the daughter of 
actress-singer Connie Stevens and singer Eddie Fisher got stage roles and TV 
guest spots. "Stumbling around," as she calls it. She dismisses the notion that 
she has a big advantage over other actors. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that were true I probably would be a huge star by now," says Fisher, 27, 
who plays Ellen DeGeneres' wacky best friend this season. "We're under more 
pressure. They want to test you, they want to compare you." 
</P>
<P>
 But she got hooked at an early age. She remembers performing as a kid with her 
mother, touring the country in a nightclub act. Much of her childhood was spent 
on the road, ordering room service in hotels and hanging out with dancers and 
comedians. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fisher also witnessed the downside of the business. Her parents divorced 
when she was 2. Her father, still on the road, had other stormy relationships 
and a substance abuse problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could see (the pitfalls) with my own eyes," Fisher says. "You do what you 
love and you pay for it too. But I didn't know anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Another drawback: comparisons to her mother. She resembled the blond-haired 
Stevens, until she dyed her hair red to play a development executive in this 
year's "I'll Do Anything." She let it grow out and dyed it again for "Ellen." 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though I love my mom and her support, you hear, 'You look like your 
mother' enough times," she says. "There's a point where I go, 'I'm me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Fisher, Gable grew up far from the public eye. He never met his father 
-- Clark Gable died in 1960, four months before he was born. His mother, the 
former Kay Spreckels, raised him on their Encino ranch. He went to private 
schools and didn't know any other show-business kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's in the blood," Gable says of his decision to go into acting. 
</P>
<P>
 He does recall watching his father's movies, but at first took a greater 
interest in one of the elder Gable's recreational pursuits: racing motorcycles, 
cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 In his teens, the younger Gable went for a career in off-road truck racing, to 
much success. In the mid-1980s he started competing in the Baja 1000, a 
rigorous and prestigious race that, strangely enough, led him to acting. 
Producer Cy Chermak contacted him about starring in a movie centered around the 
race, and Gable took acting lessons to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
 He first real role was in the Western "Bad Jim" in 1989, which also featured 
James Brolin and Richard Roundtree. He has one scene in "Margaret," where 
Mitchcell spurns his character's advances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still learning the craft," he says. "But I'm my own person. I do my own 
thing -- I like to act and race. I use my own style. That I am (Clark Gable's) 
son really doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
 He scoffs at any suggestion he would have appeared in the upcoming "Scarlett," 
a sequel to "Gone with the Wind." He doesn't even see himself in romantic 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Action-adventure, that's my type," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all his father's famous roles, one stands out as his favorite, in the 
largely forgotten movie "To Please a Lady" (1950). His dad plays a race car 
driver.

THE LONG 'RENEGADE' ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIBBY SLATE, Libby Slate is a frequent contributor to TV Times and Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The bounty hunter Lorenzo Lamas plays on the syndicated series "Renegade" 
rides a Harley across country as a framed cop seeking to clear his name. 
</P>
<P>
 In his own life, Lamas' name is nothing if not a steady source of 
encouragement to work at his craft. His parents -- the late Fernando Lamas, an 
actor and director, and Arlene Dahl, an actress and author -- provide good rode 
models, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father gave me a great work ethic. He was very disciplined and prepared, 
as an actor and a director," Lamas says. "I saw the reverence his crews had for 
him. They respected the hell out of him. It's a constant image on my mind. I 
constantly strive to emulate that. He was a great man." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to TV fame, the "Renegade" role of Reno Raines is the second 
breakout part for Lamas, now in his third season on the action series. Lamas 
became a certified heartthrob in the 1981-1990 CBS prime-time soap "Falcon 
Crest" as playboy Lance Cumson, grandson of the Napa Valley wine matriarch 
portrayed by Jane Wyman. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamas, 36, has found syndication stardom to be "a double-edged sword." He 
explains: "The lights on the marquee are a little smaller. Executives in the 
television business look at us as the black sheep -- we don't get all the 
print, mainly because there is no network to foot the bill for all the 
publicity, and we're difficult to advertise because we're in different time 
slots on different days all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there are very positive elements. You get a chance to really work on your 
character because you get 22 shows per season right off the bat." Created by 
the prolific Stephen J. Cannell, "Renegade" airs in 94% of the United States 
and in about 60 foreign countries. Lamas fit the bill as Raines, in part 
because he was well known overseas, thanks to "Falcon Crest," and partly 
because of his own flair for action. Lamas is a motorcyclist, auto racer and 
holder of a black belt in tournament karate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This role is right up my alley," says the actor, who had been co-producing 
direct-to-video features before Cannell beckoned. "There are things about the 
character I've always wanted to play -- an upstanding kind of morally sound guy 
with a sense of fairness and integrity. It's a refreshing change from Lance, 
this 'yes' person who was a slave to money. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I wanted to do action, because I have that to offer. I think there's a 
certain viability that comes through. It helps to have something special to 
offer in this business, to create an image, which then garners work. It's 
turned out to be a real good career move." 
</P>
<P>
 Like his father before him, that career extends behind the camera. Lamas 
directed an episode of "Renegade" last season, a vote of confidence earned 
after Cannell saw a video film Lamas helmed two years ago, "CIA II: Target 
Alexa." He will direct two more episodes, and this year also receives a credit 
as producer. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of his parents, he says, taught him to be a good parent to his own three 
children: son Alvaro Joshua, 10, and daughter Shayne, 8, from his first 
marriage; and daughter Payton Lee, 6, from his relationship with "Falcon Crest" 
co-star Daphne Ashbrook. He recently divorced his third wife, "Renegade" 
co-star Kathleen Kinmont. "It wasn't a hateful divorce," he says. "We have 
respect for each other. I really enjoy working with her." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking ahead, Lamas hopes to direct and produce more, as well as do some 
acting on sitcoms. Feature films are on his mind too. "Midnight Man," an 
independent action-thriller in which he stars, is set for a spring release. 
</P>
<P>
 "Features are a definite desire. They're probably the closest thing to my 
heart right now. I want a shot." 
</P>
<P>
 "Renegade" airs Saturdays at 7 p.m. on KCBS and 11:30 p.m. on KGTV.

HAIL 'CAESAR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding " 'Caesar' Played the Game Before 'Quiz,' " by Patt Morrison (Film 
Clips, Oct. 16): 
</P>
<P>
 What a delight to read an article about one of my all-time favorite films, 
"Champagne for Caesar." I thought I may be one of a handful of people who not 
only remember this film but think it is top-notch fare. 
</P>
<P>
 I watched it numerous times when it was first on TV many moons ago and finally 
taped it to have it in my collection. It's always an enjoyable experience. 
</P>
<P>
 I had the good fortune to meet Vincent Price a few years ago. Although our 
encounter was brief, I did tell him that the role I liked the most was his 
portrayal of Burnbridge Waters. He seemed pleased, especially since I suppose 
so many people told him they found his horror roles more satisfying. Not me, 
and I guess not Patt Morrison either. 
</P>
<P>
 I agree that the most delicious moment in the film is when Price gets that 
call from Prof. Einstein. A classic! 
</P>

<P>
 Where do I sign up for your campaign for a revival, not a remake, of 
"Champagne for Caesar"? 
</P>
<P>
 I have such fond memories of this movie of the '50s, which was one of the 
first few I saw as a then-new immigrant to the United States. It surely 
prompted me to memorize my Social Security number forever more.

 It's hardly surprising that Vincent Price delivered a "splendid comic turn" in 
"Champagne for Caesar." Despite the popularity of his horror films, the actor 
had one of the best senses of humor in Hollywood and excelled in farce. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, Price himself was a quiz-show celebrity contestant. Twice in 
1956 he appeared in the capacity of art expert on "The $64,000 Challenge," both 
times tying for the championship. Aline Saarinen wrote in the New York Times: 
"At once urbane and appealing, (Price) communicated to millions an infectious 
enthusiasm and an adventuresomeness into modern art. . . . When he said, 'You 
don't need $64,000 to be a collector or enjoy art -- it doesn't even cost 
sixty-four cents to go to a museum,' he took art off its pedestal and showed it 
to be alive and pertinent." (Price was never implicated in the ensuing coaching 
scandal.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Champagne for Caesar" is not "virtually forgotten" -- in researching my book 
for Citadel Press on Vincent's film career, I've found fans aplenty. Tuesday 
marked the one-year anniversary of his death. How nice to see a classic 
Hollywood comedy that contains one of his most memorable performances basking 
in the spotlight.

 The obscurity and apparent unavailability of "Champagne for Caesar" is the 
unfortunate fate of a number of independent films. 
</P>
<P>
 It was originally released by United Artists, though all rights were retained 
by producer Harry M. Popkin. Unlike such sources of UA product as Goldwyn, 
Hughes, Korda and Selznick, whose protection of their libraries was well 
documented, many other UA releases (and those from companies like Screen Guild 
and Film Classics) were early bargain titles in the 16mm non-theatrical market 
and the earliest American films to be released to TV. There, they were run to 
death in the early '50s, then shunted aside and forgotten as the major studio 
releases became available, and their copyrights were often allowed to lapse 
into the public domain. 
</P>
<P>
 With ownership in question and storage fees not being paid, not only have the 
35mm negatives on so many of these films been lost or junked, but so have even 
the dupe negatives used to make the 16mm prints. What copies do exist are 
usually from either 35mm prints saved by collectors or cobbled together from 
what is left of those beat-up 16mm library or TV prints. 
</P>
<P>
 If a good copy of "Champagne for Caesar" is not in an archive, perhaps Patt 
Morrison's article will inspire someone who has a good copy to make it 
available for preservation.

 I would like to applaud Martin Bernheimer for helping to bring to public 
attention a problem that the community of Los Angeles cannot seem to reconcile 
("Balletic Blight Still Plagues L.A.," Oct. 16). 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of a major ballet company in a city of this size is a travesty.With 
no disrespect to Omaha, how can they support a company and we cannot? Young 
dancers such as myself are forced to leave and find employment elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernheimer only touched briefly on the possible reasons for this gap in our 
arts triumvirate. Part of the reason is a lack of suitable space. Rent within 
Los Angeles drives many companies out of the city to rehearse, and they are 
therefore not a true part of the community. Suitable performance spaces are 
also at a premium. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem is our media, which help to force-feed the movies as the 
primary art to us and starve us of information related to the talent within the 
city.

 While I am not the most learned dance devotee, I enjoy being able to see some

</P>
<P>
 Bernheimer's commentary doesn't even seem to make logical sense when in one 
paragraph he says that "Costa Mesa impresarios -- past and present -- deserve 
credit for keeping the spark alive" and in the very next paragraph he berates 
James Doolittle as a "veteran huckster-hypester sponsor" for previously 
bringing Los Angeles County some of the very same companies: American Ballet 
Theatre, the Joffrey and the Kirov, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 I think you should retire Bernheimer and let him see what he can bring to the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.

 Regarding "It's Not Easy Being Greene," Oct. 16: 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Christon's article on Shecky Greene was outstanding -- informative, 
funny, sad, compelling, a rare moving, well-written story.It should be printed 
in medical journals. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope that Greene will be free from his demons and that his genius will 
thrive and prosper. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Dr. Ronald Gershman and his expertise. Mental illness is a dreadful 
disease. Lucky that Greene found him!

<P>
 Thanks to The Times for publishing and giving proper space to a proper story.

<P>
 And thanks to Shecky for allowing his moving experiences to help others.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: ANNA AND THE BOYS OF THE N.Y. TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN, Robin Abcarian's column is published Wednesdays and Sundays. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What a relief for all the guilt-plagued, overworked mothers in the land. New 
York Times Op-Ed columnist Anna Quindlen will walk away from one of the most 
coveted jobs in American journalism at the end of the year not to spend more 
time with her three children as some have written, but because -- and only 
because -- she wants to write fiction full-time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm changing jobs," says the woman who has won a Pulitzer Prize, written two 
novels and been named one of the outstanding mothers in America. "But that 
doesn't mean I am still not going to be working really hard. . . . Hey, I can't 
spend any more time than I spend with my kids now or else I'd kill 'em." 
</P>
<P>
 Whew. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For most of her 17-year tenure at the New York Times, Quindlen, 42, has 
followed a singular and stellar career path. Her special status, she 
acknowledges, speaks to a narrow view on the part of her employer. 
</P>
<P>
 She is the only woman to currently own a place on the boys-clubbish Op-Ed 
page, and the only woman whose name has surfaced in discussions about the line 
of succession for top editor jobs there, even though she has not held a 
management position for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the way it works everyplace," says Quindlen, in town last week to 
promote her new novel, "One True Thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 'the girl.' One time, I was at an editor's conference and an editor (at 
another paper) said to me, 'I'd love to run your column, but we already run 
Ellen Goodman.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to imagine an editor saying to Dave Barry or Mike Royko or the late 
Lewis Grizzard: "Sorry, we can't use you, we already run Russell Baker." Or to 
William Safire and George Will: "Your services will not be needed because we 
already run Patrick Buchanan." 
</P>
<P>
 In practical terms, this means that if an abortion doctor gets shot the same 
week a judge hands down an appallingly light sentence to a man who has killed 
his cheatin' wife, and/or Hillary Clinton says something particularly 
unexpected, "the girl" faces a dilemma: She can be reasonably certain her male 
colleagues will not be moved to comment, and reasonably certain her readers 
will want to hear what she has to say on all three topics. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're like, 'Hey, somebody's gotta take up the slack here, boys and girls,' 
but nobody does," says Quindlen. "You look at Op-Ed pages and in general, they 
have one woman, one person of color, and eight white guys. I don't want to get 
into quotas, because I dream of a day when all the people on the Op-Ed page are 
women, but people get real comfortable with a 'one-fer' approach. So-and-so is 
black and so-and-so is our woman and there's all the rest." 
</P>
<P>
 In her case, being "the girl" has worked to her advantage tremendously. She 
was a fast-rising editor when she took a six-month maternity leave after the 
birth of her first son, now 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen months later, she had her second son, now 9, and quit the paper 
altogether. But then-Executive Editor A.M. Rosenthal asked her to write a 
free-lance column that would be about "what I was talking to my friends about 
on the telephone." That column was "Life in the 30s," about the quotidian 
concerns of a mom and wife (Quindlen's husband, Gerald Krovatin, is a defense 
attorney). It was an astonishing departure for the staid, nearly anti-first 
person New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 It is perhaps a measure of the New York Times' editorial egocentricity that 
Quindlen's "Life in the 30s," which ran from 1986 to 1988, has often been 
described as a groundbreaking journalistic exercise, but, in fact, columnists 
at newspapers all over the country had been mining their families for material 
for years, decades even. (Think, for instance, of our own Jack Smith.)  
</P>
<P>
 Quindlen abandoned that column after her daughter, now 5, was born, but was 
lured back to the paper in 1990 with the prized spot on the Op-Ed page. Her 
column, "Public & Private," gave heart to a page that was virtually all brain 
and won her the Pulitzer Prize in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because she has been the most visible woman at one of the most visible and 
prestigious newspapers in the country, there has always been a sense -- however 
exaggerated -- that what Quindlen does has repercussions across the 
journalistic landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, her latest move has, perhaps unfairly, inspired all sorts of 
gloomy commentary on What This Means for Journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 In some quarters, speculation has centered on the notion that her resignation 
represents a failure of efforts -- hers and others -- to humanize the 
cutthroat, male-dominated work environment of the New York Times. She talks 
often, for instance, about "happiness as a management principle," and indeed 
gave a speech on that topic last week to a meeting of magazine publishers in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that Quindlen would rather be writing fiction than struggling to 
change the New York Times is a potent statement about the clash of values 
ripping journalism apart," wrote New York magazine media critic Jon Katz. 
</P>
<P>
 "That piece made me really uncomfortable because it was really overreaching," 
Quindlen says. "When he talked about how they could have done something to keep 
me, and what did it mean if they couldn't hold on to me. The fact of the matter 
is the first salvo in the conversation with the publisher was, 'Is there 
anything we can do?' and my answer was, no, I have something entirely different 
that I want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she says, she gets the feeling readers think she is "letting down 'the 
side' -- that I am liberal in an increasingly conservative time, that I am 
feminist in an anti-feminist time. Abortion and gay rights activists, I think, 
are sorry to see me go." 
</P>
<P>
 So, too, are her bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be hard to imagine the Op-Ed page without her," said New York Times 
Publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. in a statement last month announcing her 
decision to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were pretty knocked out by the whole thing," says Quindlen. "I mean, 
people don't leave. But I always feel the best way you can be valuable to an 
institution is to be ready to leave at any time. It means you are willing to 
take chances that people who are really invested in staying there the rest of 
their life won't take." 
</P>
<P>
 Her most famous column, which ran in 1991, is a case in point. In it, she 
criticized the New York Times for naming the woman who had accused William 
Kennedy Smith of rape in a profile that drew heavy criticism for its portrayal 
of his accuser. (Smith was acquitted.) 
</P>
<P>
 "My publisher reads my column when it appears in print," Quindlen says. "And I 
remember thinking, 'The worst thing they can do is fire me, and I can live with 
that.' If you're always ready for that, you can take those kinds of wild 
chances. But if you become that kind of entrenched company person, you never 
will. They will say, you know, so-and-so is the perfect Timesman. Well, I was 
never going to be the perfect Timesman." 
</P>
<P>
 No, she could be virtually anything she wanted to be at that newspaper, but 
never the perfect Timesman. 
</P>
<P>
 And isn't it strange? You never hear about the perfect Timeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 After all these years and so much progress, there isn't any such thing.

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; A QUIET FORCE; DOROTHY E. LEAVEY LOVES SHARING HER MILLIONS 
WITH THE NEEDY AND THE DESERVING -- ESPECIALLY CHILDREN. BUT MUCH OF IT IS DONE 
ANONYMOUSLY. SHE DOESN'T LIKE THE FUSS.

<P>
 Dorothy E. Leavey sits, her posture quite fine, on a green floral couch under 
a painting of horses, patiently awaiting her guest. From the entry hall of her 
corner home in Beverly Hills, she appears almost regal, with a crown of thick 
snow-white hair and a three-strand pearl necklace -- a leaner, granite-jawed 
Barbara Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Is she really 98?  
</P>
<P>
 If neither her name nor that of the Thomas and Dorothy Leavey Foundation is 
familiar, it's quite deliberate. For years, this benefactor and matriarch -- 
nine grandchildren; seven, going on eight, great-grandchildren -- has declined 
to make her contributions to Los Angeles widely known. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that her name is carved into two prominent and distinctly different 
new buildings, in Hollywood and on the USC campus, there is no escaping 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's embarrassing, it's very embarrassing" seeing your name on buildings, 
Leavey says. "I just don't like to have it bannered about. I don't care for a 
lot of hoo-rah. But I get kind of a little twinge when I see Dorothy up there." 
</P>
<P>
 She smiles broadly. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last 15 years, the 42-year-old Leavey Foundation has donated $100 
million to educational, medical and Catholic institutions, primarily in 
Southern California. Leavey's late husband made the family fortune as 
co-founder of Farmers Insurance, started in a small office on Spring Street a 
year before the 1929 stock market crash, and saw it become a 
multibillion-dollar enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Leavey died in 1980, leaving his wife of 50 years to help fulfill his 
legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 What has made the Leaveys so generous? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, very simply, if you have some available help (to give)," she 
saysslowly, her voice hoarsened by age, "there's no use in you not giving to 
someone who needs it. But it's been easy for me to help somebody else. I come 
from a very generous family in the first place. Whenever they have an 
opportunity to help someone, they have done that." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, she adds: "I love to be charitable about things. But not overly so." 
</P>
<P>
 "You mean you hold back ?" quips Leavey's daughter, 1954 USC homecoming queen 
and college trustee Kathleen Leavey McCarthy, who helped persuade her mother to 
finally talk about her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Leavey laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 She speaks with an economy of words, as if to conserve energy, and there is a 
certain reserve with someone new. Her humor is still razor-sharp. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how she spends her days, Leavey's brown eyes sparkle: "Getting the best 
of my daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to cite the most important thing about Dorothy Leavey, she fairly 
shouts: "Survival!"  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Heartache came with a bang. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 29, 1979, Dorothy Leavey's younger daughter, Dorothy Therese (Terry) 
Lemons, was killed when a California Highway Patrol employee, driving 82 m.p.h. 
on the Golden State Freeway near Magic Mountain, crashed his car into the van 
she was riding in. She was 40, and the mother of five. The driver of the 
state-owned car pleaded guilty to vehicular manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 On the same day a year later, Thomas Leavey died at 82 after an extended 
illness. "Grandma told me," says Karen Lemons, "that Grandpa -- we called him 
Poppa -- died the day Mom died, and it took him a year to just physically die." 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring of 1981, Dorothy Leavey reached out to Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving. Candy Lightner, who had founded MADD in Sacramento in 1980, four days 
after her 13-year-old daughter Cari was killed, recalls verbatim the telegram 
Leavey sent: " 'I have heard of your work. I would like to know how I can 
help.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lightner phoned, and Leavey invited her to lunch at the Los Angeles Country 
Club, where Lightner was asked to shed her slacks in favor of a club-issued 
skirt. Barbara Bloomberg, a founder of the L.A. MADD chapter, joined them. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing about MADD's mission, Leavey asked what she could do to help. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'We need money, we are desperate for money,' " Lightner told her. 
</P>
<P>
 Leavey wrote a personal check, handing it to Lightner under the table. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at it and I started crying. I thought it was for a $1,000," Lightner 
recalls. "I had never seen so many zeros in my life. (I thought), 'Oh God, this 
is wonderful -- $1,000,' and tried to hand it to Barbara under the table to be 
cool and classy, and Barbara is looking at it, and her eyes are bulging, and 
(then) I realized what it was." 
</P>
<P>
 It was $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation would ultimately give MADD almost $2 million. And for years, 
the plate on Leavey's Cadillac sedan read "4 MADD." 
</P>
<P>
 "Without them," says Lightner, now president of the Arab-American 
Anti-Discrimination Committee, "there would be no MADD." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Leavey insisted on anonymity. "She would not allow us to publicize 
her gifts or her in any way," Lightner says. "She was very adamant. . . . It 
was always, 'What are you doing?' 'How can I help?' She would write letters to 
newspapers and legislators. She put her money where her heart is." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Leavey had also observed a code of near silence. In a 1963 letter to 
one of his grandsons, he wrote: "Humbleness wins and keeps loyal friends, and 
assists you in building a successful career . . . undue self-promotion and 
so-called 'strutting' in an attempt to impress (others) causes them to 
eventually turn their back upon you. . . . Do not hesitate to render a helping 
hand to others." 
</P>
<P>
 The tradition lives on. J. Thomas McCarthy, a lawyer who succeeded his 
father-in-law as chairman of the Leavey Foundation, will not say how much money 
has been given to whom: "It would embarrass them and embarrass us." 
</P>
<P>
 But the people at Aunt Bee's Laundry Service for People with AIDS and Thrift 
Shop in Hollywood are not shy. The group received $5,000 in 1992 and another 
$10,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Leavey people were the very first foundation to give us money -- $5,000 
was very big money to us," says founder Miki Jackson. "They gave it to help get 
us opened. It helped legitimize us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their bet paid off," Jackson adds. "We've got 182 clients, and we do a lot of 
wash. . . . Seventy percent of our clients are people of color who were having 
a hard time making ends meet, even before they got ill." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Leavey has long played a role in finding people to help, including the 
more than 400 disabled clients at the Lincoln Training Center in South El Monte 
and the kids who benefit from Childhelp. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly $300,000 has gone to the agency's national child abuse hot line; to buy 
new bedding and make renovations for Childhelp West, a foster care facility in 
Beaumont, Calif., and to other projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than just the money, what I love about Dorothy is her true caring," says 
Childhelp co-founder and chairman Sara O'Meara. "She came to the headquarters 
of our child abuse hot line to see the work we were doing firsthand. . . . And 
she never failed to thank us for the work we were doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Helping children has long been a special interest. 
</P>
<P>
 " Childhelp -- it spoke for itself," Leavey says. "To see a child not having 
the opportunities I have had, my children have had. . . . I was always a loved 
child," she adds, "more or less pampered." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Dorothy Risley Leavey, family always came first; charity essentially began 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
 When she was 25, single and working as a legal secretary in San Francisco, her 
mother in Missoula, Mont., died suddenly of pneumonia. Although her father was 
alive, Dorothy's 12-year-old sister soon joined her in California. The pair 
settled in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got a heart of gold," Yvonne Edwards, now living in Sherman Oaks, says 
of her sister. "She has been very good to me through the years." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy, the middle child of Dalton and Irene Burbridge Risley, was born in 
Omaha, Neb. Her brother would find success as the inventor of Rislone, an 
automobile oil. The family moved a lot, to Cleveland, to Chicago -- where 
Dorothy graduated from the Convent of the Sacred Heart school in neighboring 
Lake Forest -- and to Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 Their father had a ranch near Butte, then a flour mill in Missoula. Dorothy 
rode horses -- "Indian style without a saddle," she recalls, looking on as her 
daughter flips through a family photo album. Spotting a shot of a sleek dark 
brown horse, she cries out: "That's my Spider. " 
</P>
<P>
 She attended the University of Montana while also working as a secretary in 
the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, hard winters and perhaps a failed romance drove her out of Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 She met Tom Leavey through a mutual friend as he and John C. Tyler were 
starting up Farmers, in 1928. They married two years later when she was almost 
34. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a couple of romances that didn't pan out, or that I didn't really want 
to pan out," Leavey recalls. "But when I met him he was everything I admired, 
we got along beautifully, and that was it." Also, she says, he was "nice and 
tall." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Leavey's beginnings had been truly hardscrabble. The youngest of three 
brothers, he was born in Ferndale, Calif., to Irish immigrants. His father, who 
had been a stableboy in Ireland, worked as a butter-maker on dairy farms. His 
mother died of milk fever a few days after his birth. 
</P>
<P>
 Leavey graduated from Santa Clara University in 1920 and from Georgetown 
University Law School in 1923, both Jesuit schools, after a brief stint as a 
World War I lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom was the only one (of the brothers) who got a college education," says 
nephew Joseph James Leavey, who once was Farmers' general counsel for claims 
litigation and now serves as a foundation trustee. "The other boys didn't have 
the money, and they saved up and put (Tom) through." 
</P>
<P>
 He would pay them back with jobs in his company. 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, Tom and Dorothy had a traditional marriage. Although she had 
her children late -- at almost 39 and 42 -- the pregnancies went smoothly. 
"When Kathleen was born, I was dancing," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the children came along, she traveled with her husband. "If he went to 
Visalia, I went to Visalia. If he went to Portland, I went to Portland," she 
recalls. "When I married, that was it. I didn't care about anything else but 
that tall, 6-foot-3 1/2 man." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, finding herself at loose ends, she sought ways to fill her free time, 
landing at the Assistance League on St. Andrews Place in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it was office work, and sometimes it was assisting in the 
development of the young children," she says. She also loved going to the 
Assistance League because movie stars from 20th Century Fox, which was then 
nearby, would dine in its lunchroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Dorothy E. Leavey Family Resource Center -- home to such 
projects as Operation School Bell, which provides new children's clothing, 
books and toys -- was dedicated at the league complex. The first $1 million for 
the $8 million pastel stucco building came from her personal funds. It is the 
only Leavey building, among at least seven stretching from Georgetown 
University to Santa Clara University, to bear her name alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she never completed college, Leavey has always been eager to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has a curiosity about the world generally," says former U.N. Ambassador 
Jeane Kirkpatrick, a family friend whose teaching position at Georgetown is 
endowed by the Leavey Foundation. "She asked me about my classes, how they 
differ through the generations. About what Reagan was like to work for, and 
what it was like to represent the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 With her own alma mater so far away, Leavey has doted on her daughters'. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, dressed in a cream-colored suit and gold Ferragamos, she 
attended the dedication of the Thomas and Dorothy Leavey Library at USC. The 
foundation gave $9 million toward its construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Leavey Library, as the elegant concrete and brickwork building is known, is a 
four-story, $28-million electronic gateway to the world's library systems: 
Basement study rooms surround a soothing mauve-carpeted area with 100 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 On the ride home after a gourmet dedication lunch, Leavey announced to her 
companions that she was still hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Leavey, we'll drive closer to home," said her caregiver. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I want something right now ," Leavey insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 So she ate a burger and fries from Jack in the Box in the chauffeured gray 
Cadillac sedan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These days Dorothy Leavey likes to sit at the top of her front steps and watch 
the world go by. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see people and I try to imagine how happy they are and so forth, and if 
they're doing anything right," Leavey says. "I just muse along with my own life 
in the background." 
</P>
<P>
 She regularly goes out to lunch at the Peninsula or the Four Seasons or 
Jimmy's, and in the summer to the Bel-Air Bay Club in Malibu. And at night she 
occasionally attends fund-raising events, or watches TV. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Saturday while watching "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman," Leavey saw 
Dr. Quinn, played by Jane Seymour, get a kiss on the neck from the character 
Sully, a hunk who sleeps in the woods with his pet wolf. 
</P>
<P>
 "More, more," Leavey called out, as one of her home companions remembers it. 
</P>
<P>
 She has lived since 1950 in the house she and her husband painstakingly 
planned, down to the little cubbyhole built to muffle the phone off the dining 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 Several times a year she goes to Pala Rey, in north San Diego County, a 
600-acre ranch and family retreat surrounded by orange and avocado trees that 
Tom Leavey bought about 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 Leavey thinks about turning 100 but doesn't dwell on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after arriving at USC on dedication day, she expertly maneuvered her 
wheelchair from her designated place at a table in the shade, seeking sunlight, 
warmth, the inevitable parade of family and friends. At ceremony's end, Marilyn 
Zumberge, widow of a university president, bent over Leavey's wheelchair. "I'm 
glad you could be here," she said with obvious emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "So am I , " came the reply. Dorothy E. Leavey 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 98. 
</P>
<P>
 Native?: No; born in Omaha, Neb.; raised in Cleveland, Chicago and Montana; 
lives in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Family: Widowed. Two daughters, Kathleen and Terry, who died in 1979; nine 
grandchildren; seven great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Passions: Helping the needy, particularly children; her Catholic faith; 
horses; bright colors; hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
 On why she gave $1 million to the Assistance League: "I don't know, other than 
the fact that it was needed. There have been some marvelous people in the 
Assistance League, and I was just one of the many that joined. . . . I think 
I'm one of the oldest members." 
</P>
<P>
 On her late husband, Thomas, and their work together: "He had such high 
ideals, and anything that I did in any charitable way or any athletic way, or 
any of that, he was right there." 
</P>
<P>
 On how it feels to be 98: "The funny part is, I don't feel any different at 
all. If I was bedridden a lot, and not being able to enjoy things, maybe it 
would be different, but I feel just like I did when I was 20 years old. I am 
just as interested in everything. . . . I still have my hair, my own hair, and 
I have my teeth too."

GALLERY: OUT OF THE RUINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In one way, fires are a tragedy. In another, they are a ritual.And a ritual is 
often the acknowledgment of things that must be; changes, like birth and death, 
that will happen whether they are acknowledged or not. 
</P>
<P>
 In her four-part environmental installation, "Feast of the Fires," Deborah 
Roundtree explores the notion of change by combining objects found among the 
ruins left by last year's Malibu fires with large color photographs. The work 
is being exhibited at the Daniel Saxon Gallery in West Hollywood until Nov. 12.

SOCIAL CLIMES / THE BUZZ: TIME FOR A LITTLE HIGH-BROW HORROR

 It's one day to Halloween, and we'll bet you still don't have your costume 
picked out, do you? Don't fret, we have a book that's sure to inspire you. 
"Fallen Angels . . . And Spirits of the Dark" (Perigee) by Robert Masello is a 
fascinating history and guide to all sorts of demons, witches, ghouls, gremlins 
and other assorted nasties. 
</P>
<P>
 How about going dressed as the demon Lerajie, "a powerful marquis, who appears 
as an archer in a green tunic, armed with bow and arrows. He stirs up battles 
among men and takes a special interest in arrow wounds -- which he causes to 
putrefy." Or how about a banshee (or "fairy woman"), which in Scotland and 
Ireland was an apparition of a woman "who haunted remote streams and secret 
pools. There, she knelt by the water, endlessly beating blood-stained shrouds 
against the stones. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 OK, it's a little esoteric, but it sure beats wrapping a scarf around your 
head and calling yourself a gypsy. 
</P>

 Reel to Royal: Now that the (gold) dust has settled from Barbara and Marvin 
Davis' Carousel of Hope mega-bash Friday, what's a fun-loving Angeleno supposed 
to do for an encore? 
</P>
<P>
 Party down with the Prince of Wales. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what some 1,000 people will be doing Tuesday night when His Royal 
Highness makes an appearance at the premiere of "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein," 
directed by and starring that multitalented Brit Kenneth Branagh. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A.'s going to have to bend a bit to abide by official protocol. As everyone 
must be seated before royalty arrives, no one will be allowed to turbo-schmooze 
until the beginning credits roll. No one. We won't name names; you know who you 
are. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and remember -- one doesn't speak to princes until spoken to. That's going 
to be tough for some photographers whose natural m.o. would be to scream, 
"Prince Charles! Charles! Over here, Charles! Charles, one more, please! 
Charles, how about one with Emma Thompson!" 
</P>

<P>
 Easy Readers: When a book party promises "thunder bellowing from Harley 
Davidson motorcycles," you can bet the guests won't be eating caviar on toast 
points and talking about skiing in Gstaad. 
</P>
<P>
 No, this is not your average soiree. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the celebration of "Rebels With a Cause" a new photographic essay book by 
Gail DeMarco that features the various people who live to ride and ride to live 
including Hell's Angels and Hell's agents, celebrities and John Q. Public. 
</P>
<P>
 The book gets a send-off Nov. 10 at the Derby in Los Feliz with a live 
performance by Jimmy Intveld and the Gigolos and possible appearances by Peter 
Fonda, Mickey Rourke, Dennis Hopper and Mary Hart. Mary Hart ? Even perky, TV 
show-hosting moms need to cut loose once in a while.

SOCIAL CLIMES / TIME OUT; A BUSY BRITON, INDEED; UK / LA FESTIVAL HAS MERRICK 
BAKER-BATES HOPPING. BUT THE DIPLOMAT ISN'T COMPLAINING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES SOCIETY WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With 54 days gone and 14 more to go for the UK/LA Festival, Merrick 
Baker-Bates, British consul general for Southern California, doesn't look any 
the worse for wear. 
</P>
<P>
 At 9 o'clock on a recent morning, the tall, slender Baker-Bates is looking 
natty in a dark blue suit, an official festival pin on his lapel. He happily 
shows guests around the 1920s-era Hancock Park home that serves as consulate 
guest house, meeting place and party venue. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Chrystal, appears briefly, but only to quickly introduce herself and 
say, "He's the one you want to talk to." 
</P>
<P>
 Over coffee in the book-lined study, Baker-Bates, consul general since 1992, 
laments that he hasn't been able to attend as many events as he would have 
liked during this "celebration of British arts" festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been quite hectic," he says. "I did go to see 'Alfie,' which was 
wonderful. We've also had something going on in Arizona as well -- an 
international trade symposium -- and I've been there five times in three 
weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker-Bates says part of his role in the festival was to "persuade the 
(British) government that this was something it should support. It was a 
serious enterprise, which people here wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no getting away from it," he adds. "Los Angeles has been struggling 
in the water, and what we're trying to do through the festival and all the 
different aspects of it, is to extend a hand and try to show people that we're 
not fair-weather friends. And I hope that when the good times come back to 
L.A., as they certainly will, then people will remember that we were there, we 
were trying to do our best." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival will end up stretching out over more than two months and 
encompassing 79 events -- everything from the Academy of St. 
Martin-in-the-Fields to the women's vocal group Black Voices to a retrospective 
of artist R.B. Kitaj to a 25th-anniversary celebration of Monty Python. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to give it the widest possible scope," Baker-Bates says, "because we 
wanted to show people that there were new things happening in the arts in 
Britain besides the well-known Royal National Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a promotional aspect to this, but on top of that is the general 
projection of Britain as a creative place." 
</P>
<P>
 One huge boost for the festival is the appearance of the Prince of Wales, who 
arrives Monday for a five-day visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the consul general worried about the scrutiny Prince Charles might have to 
endure while he's here, considering the recent spate of royal scandals? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's probably pretty used to it," Baker-Bates says. "Any other 
extraneous bits and pieces won't bother him because he's got his visit, his 
program and the people he's going to meet very much in mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Before moving to Los Angeles a little more than two years ago, Baker-Bates had 
a varied diplomatic service career that took him from Tokyo to Washington, 
D.C., to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his travels, he's become a fierce defender of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I go to other cities, people say, 'You're from Los Angeles, are you? Bad 
luck.' And I say it's not bad luck at all. Los Angeles is a place with serious 
character and it's a great city. Those other places, whilst being very 
interesting, are not, in that sense, in that very rounded sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his various moves Baker-Bates doesn't come down with homesickness 
often, although he admits a penchant for reading British newspapers and 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do go to the King's Head (a Santa Monica pub and restaurant) from time to 
time because I like a pint of Guinness. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we do eat a lot of British food. I love British marmalade. Last night I 
had a total self-indulgence. It was totally disgraceful. I ate a steamed ginger 
pudding with custard, which I love." 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of the Prince's arrival, Baker-Bates is gearing up for two more 
weeks of festival events. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he's looking forward to seeing the Royal Shakespeare Co.'s "Henry VI, 
The Battle for the Throne" because "It's one of Shakespeare's lesser-known 
plays. I've been reading it and I have to confess, it gives me nightmares. I 
have to put it down because it's tremendously bloody."

DOCTORS, HOW ABOUT REDEFINING HEALTHY ? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As president-for-life of Softbodies of America -- whose membership consists of 
everyone who agrees with me, whether they've heard of me or not -- I must 
respond to "How Best to Tackle Weight Problem?" (Oct. 18). 
</P>
<P>
 The panel of 18 experts got it all wrong. Again. 
</P>
<P>
 As our millions of members (rough estimate) could tell you, setting standards 
for "healthy" or "desirable" weights is enough to send a person running for 
Betty Crocker lemon bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people older than 35 cannot achieve those weights without starving 
themselves and working out to the point of exhaustion or resorting to 
liposuction. Is this healthy? Is this normal? 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors, back to the drawing board. Give us a healthy life. Moderate exercise, 
reasonable amounts of tasty food. If we're doing everything right, and we're 
still shaped like teddy bears, surely someone will love us. But apparently it 
won't be you.

IT'S THE PARENTS' JOB TO TEACH VALUES TO KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re the letter to the editor from Jan Ferris of North Hills ("What's Happened 
to Shame? It's Vanished," Oct. 16): Ferris writes that since parents don't 
teach their children moral values, schoolteachers should do it. What bunk. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the responsibility of teachers, police officers or social workers to 
raise children. None of these people or agencies brought your child into the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents are responsible for teaching moral values and being role models to 
their children. Letters like Ferris' just encourage people with no parenting 
skills to say, "See how society failed my child." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 I agree that feeling shame is the first step in accepting responsibility for a 
bad deed, which many parents are not teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 However, before passing on one more burden to teachers, please just go to any 
school and spend one day in a classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, teachers do not have time to teach the 3 Rs because they are 
expected to do parents' jobs.

THE LOW COST OF PEP IN THE MID '40S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Price of Pep" (Oct. 6) reminded me of my days as head song leader at 
Woodrow Wilson High School in Long Beach in the mid '40s. 
</P>
<P>
 In that era, our mothers made our outfits from heavy white cotton -- with high 
necks, long sleeves, and skirts to the knee. 
</P>
<P>
 We wore a crimson and gold letterman's "W" on our chests and white shoes with 
bobby socks. Our pompons were constructed of cut-off broom handles with red and 
yellow crepe-paper twists. 
</P>
<P>
 How modest (and inexpensive) our costumes were in those days.

ADVICE THAT MAKES IT EASY TO SWALLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "A Bitter Pill to Swallow" in C.A. Wedlan's "Health Roundup" (Oct. 18): 
Because I must consume "big, chalky horse pills," (calcium), I can suggest a 
method that helps. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, people will throw their heads back, closing the throat too soon. 
Tilting the head forward and placing the pill on the tongue facilitates 
swallowing the pill with a large sip of water. It works.

THE MANY BENEFICIARIES OF THE LEAVEYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MICHAELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Leavey Foundation is housed in a no-frills, one-administrator office at 
Farmers Group Inc. on Wilshire Boulevard. But its funding decisions are made 
around Dorothy Leavey's dining room table.Of the six trustees, four are family 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Although more than 50% of the money goes to a host of Catholic institutions, 
including Loyola-Marymount University and St. John's Hospital, the list of 
beneficiaries is quite diverse: the United Negro College Fund; Para Los Ninos, 
a Skid Row agency aiding homeless families; Childrens Hospital; California 
Medical Center; the Right to Life League of Southern California; the Music 
Center, and the California 4-H Foundation, among dozens of others. An original 
focus, scholarships for children of Farmers employees, still exists.

<P>
 It was Dorothy Leavey who apparently led her husband to Freedoms Foundation, a 
nonpartisan educational institution in Valley Forge, Pa. But he came up with 
the idea of establishing awards, bearing the family name, for educators who 
excel in teaching about free enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 In tribute to the $4 million in gifts the Leaveys have made to Freedoms 
Foundation over the years, their portraits hang -- along with those of George 
and Martha Washington -- in its reception area. 
</P>
<P>
 On a smaller scale, a San Fernando Valley man who gives horseback rides to 
blind children and retired Marine officers who run a camp at Camp Pendleton for 
inner-city kids have made good with Leavey money. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Leavey Foundation has started breaking in the third generation.

TV REVIEW; 'FIRES OF AUTUMN' A MELODRAMATIC MISFIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is difficult, if not impossible, for the media to ignore the anniversary of 
major events. It is particularly difficult for television, our voracious daily 
visual medium, to skip an anniversary -- especially when it is one associated 
with dramatic footage and awesome natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it is that KCAL-TV Channel 9 delivers "The Fires of Autumn," a 
year-later look at the hellish firestorms that engulfed five Southern 
California counties last October, burned more than 1,200 homes and businesses 
and left three dead and some 200 injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, in the hands of a team of KCAL news reporters under the 
direction of producer Lisa Brown, this is one anniversary that would have been 
better off merely noted in passing on the 10 o'clock news. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, host David Jackson, a "Prime 9 News" anchor, and reporters Matt 
Stevens, Michele Gile, Toni Guinyard, Bill Gephardt, Gay Yee and Sylvia Lopez 
have mined just about every word, phrase or theatrical pause in the Book of 
Melodrama in this grating, annoying effort to cash in on an admittedly good 
stash of footage. All this is under the guise of providing an uplifting look at 
stories of "courage, tragedy and rebuilding." A heavy-handed message of hope is 
used to justify rerunning all those neat shots of folks in distress. 
</P>
<P>
 Important issues are raised -- safety, construction, insurance -- but only 
touched upon, lest they get in the way of phrases such as "the future gagged 
while the present burned" and "victims forced to suffer and heal at once." 
</P>
<P>
 Suffering viewers will find it hard not to gag in the present. Healing at once 
is easy -- just click the remote. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Fires of Autumn" airs at 9 tonight on KCAL-TV Channel 9 (and repeats 
Nov. 6 at 9 p.m.). MARTIN ZIMMERMAN

WESTSIDE WATCH: LOUIS GOSSETT JR. TAPPED TO LEAD CHRISTMAS PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This year the celebrities had better stay in formation. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand marshal for the 63rd annual Hollywood Christmas Parade will be actor 
Louis Gossett Jr., who won a best supporting actor Oscar for his portrayal of a 
tough drill instructor in the 1982 movie "An Officer and a Gentleman." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nov. 27 parade, which is expected to draw more than a million spectators 
to Hollywood Boulevard, features a procession of celebrities and an appearance 
by Santa Claus. It will be seen in more than 150 cities nationwide and aired in 
international markets by the Tribune Entertainment syndicate. 
</P>
<P>
 Past parade grand marshals include Jimmy Stewart, Sammy Davis Jr., Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, Charlton Heston, Bob Hope and Roseanne.

<P>
 COURTING CONTROVERSY: Candidates have several ways to respond to attack 
mailers: they could send out one in response, hold a news conference or file a 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Going to court seems to be a recent solution of choice. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-El Segundo) sued opponent David Barrett Cohen 
last week for 
</P>
<P>
 $1 million over a mailer stating that Dills collects a legislative pension at 
the same time he serves in Sacramento. That's prohibited by state law. 
</P>
<P>
 "That implies that I am in collusion with the retirement system," said Dills, 
who is running for reelection in the 28th State Senate District, which includes 
Marina del Rey, Venice, Westchester and Playa del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills collects Social Security and pensions from his days as a schoolteacher 
and municipal judge. The suit also names Republican Julian Sirull, who is 
running against Assemblywoman Debra Bowen in the 53rd Assembly District, 
because he was included in the mailer. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Cohen issued a statement of apology and took full responsibility 
for the statement. He said that it was placed in the mailer -- recently sent to 
absentee voters -- after a consultant mistook Dills' legislative salary for a 
pension. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, the error was a minor one," Cohen said. "It's important, 
however, to correct the record so voters can decide." 
</P>
<P>
 Dills is being represented in the lawsuit by Michael I. Sidley, the Venice 
attorney who lost to him in the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, former Palos Verdes Estates Councilman Ron Florance is suing Rancho 
Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks. Brooks beat him in the June Republican 
primary in the 36th Congressional District, which runs from San Pedro to 
Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 Florance claims he was libeled in a mailer titled "60 Lawsuits and Counting." 
The ad called Florance "the Republican who can't win in or out of court." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also names Ron Yates, the publisher of California's Republic 
Reporter, which published an article about his litigation; Republican John 
Duke, who appeared in the Reporter as part of his unsuccessful campaign against 
Rep. Steve Horn (R-Long Beach); Brooks' husband, Jim, and campaign worker Les 
Martin. Florance is seeking punitive damages of $250,000, general damages of $1 
and legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks' campaign charged that the filing of the lawsuits was "politically 
motivated." 
</P>
<P>
 "His new lawsuit is just the latest example of Mr. Florance's inability to 
solve any problems outside of the courtroom," said Jim Brooks, an adviser to 
his wife's campaign. "I guess we'll have to change the title of the mailer from 
'60 Lawsuits and Counting' to '61 Lawsuits and Counting.' "

CONGRESS 36TH DISTRICT; INCUMBENCY MAY HINDER HARMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again, Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills) had tapped one of her 
Washington friends for a visit to her district. This time it was CIA Director 
James Woolsey. 
</P>
<P>
 As the congresswoman introduced Woolsey at a recent gathering, she quipped: 
"Some of you think I know everybody. I don't know everybody. I just know 
everybody good." 
</P>
<P>
 On paper, Harman would seem to have potent weapons in her race for a second 
term -- and connections with Washington powerbrokers is just one. There is also 
her adept fund raising and personal wealth, her two powerful committee posts 
and her host of endorsements from aerospace executives and police chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this election year, Harman's arsenal doesn't pack the usual punch -- 
even with an opponent, Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks, who was 
all but unknown before the primary and has far less campaign cash. This time 
around, Harman is something that poll after poll says the electorate doesn't 
like: an incumbent, a D.C. insider and a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is what is making this race so much harder, even if (incumbents like 
Harman) make the system work," said political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, 
senior associate at the Center for Politics and Economics at Claremont Graduate 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ben Sheffner, assistant editor of the Cook Political Report in 
Washington: "Harman is one of the purest examples of a candidate who won based 
on the strength of the Democrats and Bill Clinton in 1992 but will be hurt by 
their relative weakness in 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 Seizing on the situation is Brooks, a fierce campaigner who has seen her 
insurgent bid bolstered by visits from GOP stalwarts and money from the 
National Republican Congressional Committee. Complicating matters for Harman, 
Brooks does not present an easy target on the issues. Like Harman, for example, 
she supports abortion rights, making it far harder for Harman to use that issue 
to peel away moderate GOP votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had no illusions about this race," said Harman, who also faces American 
Independent Joseph Fields and Libertarian Jack Tyler. "I've detected the anger 
(of the electorate). You go to the League of Women Voters event, and there are 
angry people. And they are unforgiving. It's, 'If you disagree with me today it 
doesn't matter what else you did.' But I think constituents are fairly 
well-informed, and I think that people want to be constructive. And I'm running 
a campaign to appeal to the positive in people." 
</P>
<P>
 Following her election two years ago, Harman moved quickly to bulid a record 
she could run on. She secured a post on the House Armed Services Committee, 
which has served her well in gaining the near-unanimous support of the 
district's aerospace executives. Harman, a one-time aide to President Jimmy 
Carter who later worked as a corporate attorney in Washington, also used the 
committee position to wade into defense issues important to the district. 
</P>
<P>
 She teamed with Rep. Steve Horn (R-Long Beach) to save the C-17 cargo plane, 
built by McDonnell Douglas in Long Beach, and lobbied then-Defense Secretary 
Les Aspin to keep the Los Angeles Air Force Base off the military's base 
closure list. Earlier this month, she was at the White House as President 
Clinton signed a bill to reform the defense procurement system. 
</P>
<P>
 Her track record, however, may not count for much -- especially since her 
Democratic base appears far less energized compared to 1992, when Clinton was 
at the top of the ticket, poised to take the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Democrat candidates are not faring so well, a fact reflected in the 
gubernatorial race between Gov. Pete Wilson and Treasurer Kathleen Brown. 
Political analysts predict that Brown, who is trailing statewide in polls, will 
be soundly beaten in the 36th Congressional District, where Democratic and 
Republican voter registration is virtually even -- 43% and 42%, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would probably give Jane Harman a slight edge, given the inroads she has 
made with the business community," said political analyst Sheffner. "I suspect 
that if people identify Jane Harman (with) saving jobs, that will help her. But 
it's not easy to get the message out. And you have to remember that this is a 
Republican district, part of which used to send Bob Dornan to Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Brooks says that Rep. Robert K. Dornan (who now represents a district 
based in Garden Grove) nicknamed Brooks "B-2 Sue," a takeoff on his nickname of 
"B-1 Bob." In her campaign, Brooks has tried to tag Harman as a carpetbagger 
who is partly to blame for a "defense meltdown." Harman voted for Clinton's 
defense budgets, which cost the district jobs, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "What people in America are screaming for is, 'We don't want these insider 
people anymore because they are screwing up the country big-time,' " said 
Brooks, a former special education teacher who grew up in Long Island, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 She says her "fire in the gut" style helped her when she and her husband, Jim, 
moved to Rancho Palos Verdes in 1985. She unsuccessfully fought the closure of 
Marineland, organized a Neighborhood Watch program and worked on a committee to 
keep local schools open. That led her to a seat on the city's Planning 
Commission and, in 1991, on the City Council. Her tenure has had its raucous 
moments, including a decision to cut the city's recreation programs to balance 
the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the campaign trail, her subject is primarily Harman-and-Clinton -- 
specifically, Harman's vote for Clinton's deficit-reduction plan, which 
included income tax increases aimed at high earners. (Harman's campaign 
responded by giving Brooks a candy bar, a reminder that she was among the City 
Council members who urged state officials not to revoke the state snack tax, 
which generated revenues for cities until it was repealed in 1992.) 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with the Brooks broadsides, Harman is using the campaign stretch run -- 
and her considerable resources -- to portray herself as above the partisan 
fray. On Wednesday, she launched a series of broadcast television 
advertisements, one of which describes her as "tough, independent and on our 
side." In the ad, Harman makes no mention of Clinton and says: "My party 
leadership isn't always happy with me." 
</P>
<P>
 And although recent polls suggest that Clinton's popularity has picked up, 
whether that puts Harman back in the driver's seat is unclear: Voters still say 
they are inclined to pick Republicans over Democrats for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Said political analyst Jeffe: "It's clear that there appears to be a 
turnaround (to) some extent, but the question is: How dramatic?"

DECISION '94; VOTERS' GUIDE; A LOOK AT AREA CONGRESSIONAL AND LEGISLATIVE RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ASSEMBLY/45th District 
</P>
<P>
 Area: Santa Monica, Brentwood, Pacific Palisades, Woodland Hills, Agoura 
Hills, Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 51% Democrat, 36% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 CANDIDATES 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat: Sheila James Kuehl, 53, attorney, law professor. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican: Michael T. Meehan, 28, reserve deputy sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
 Libertarian: Philip W. Baron, 33, real estate salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 After routing five Democratic challengers in the primary, the liberal Kuehl is 
expected to come out on top in this Westside-Valley district, which has for two 
years been the bailiwick of retiring Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman 
(D-Brentwood). Kuehl's Republican opponent, Meehan, is banking on a large 
turnout of conservative voters to score an upset. ASSEMBLY/42nd District 
</P>
<P>
 Area: West Los Angeles east of the San Diego Freeway and north of Wilshire 
Boulevard, Beverly Hills, West Hollywood, Sherman Oaks, Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 60% Democrat, 25% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 CANDIDATES 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat: Wally Knox, 47, attorney and Los Angeles Community College District 
board member. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican: Robert Davis, 49, entrepreneur. 
</P>
<P>
 Libertarian: Eric M. Fine, 31, business consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 Knox squeaked past six other Democrats in the June primary. Given the lopsided 
Democratic registration advantage in this district, he is the clear 
front-runner in the general election contest. His tough-on-crime stance has 
been softened somewhat since the primary, and he says he opposes the 
"three-strikes" and anti-illegal immigration initiatives on the ballot. 
Challenger Davis, taking traditional GOP stands against high taxes and high 
spending, is fighting an uphill battle. ASSEMBLY/47th District 
</P>
<P>
 Area: Crenshaw, Baldwin Hills, Culver City, Cheviot Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 76% Democrat, 14% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 CANDIDATES 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat: Kevin Murray, 34, lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican: Jonathan Leonard, 63, retired firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Libertarian: Kevin C. Murphy, 40, computer software designer. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace and Freedom: Tamara Taleebah, 45, teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 Given the overwhelming Democratic tilt of the 47th, the real contest in this 
district was the nine-candidate Democratic primary. Leonard, however, still 
hopes to make a race of it. And confusion between Murray and Libertarian Murphy 
could shake things up a little. But analysts say there's little to stop Murray 
and his father, Assemblyman Willard Murray, from becoming the Assembly's first 
father-son team. ASSEMBLY/53rd District 
</P>
<P>
 Area: Venice, Westchester, Marina del Rey, Hermosa Beach, Lomita, Manhattan 
Beach, Redondo Beach, Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 43% Democrat, 41% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 CANDIDATES 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat: Debra Bowen, 39, assemblywoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican: Julian Sirull, 36, businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 Libertarian: William N. Gaillard, 42, public works employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace and Freedom: J. Kevin Bishop, 47, cable installer. 
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen is running her first reelection race with a solid campaign bankroll and 
a growing reputation as an activist in the Assembly. Sirull touts his business 
experience as a commercial real estate agent, and says he would do more to keep 
businesses from leaving the state. But unless he gets a last-minute boost from 
the state Republican party, pundits say he'll have trouble making this a 
contest. STATE SENATE/28th District 
</P>
<P>
 Area: Playa del Rey, Westchester, Marina del Rey, Venice, Compton, Carson, 
Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 52% Democrat, 33% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 CANDIDATES 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat: Ralph C. Dills, state senator. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican: David Barrett Cohen, attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Libertarian: Neal Arvid Donner, teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace and Freedom: Cindy V. Henderson, customer service representative. 
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 Dills first went to Sacramento when F.D.R. was in the White House, and he's 
fighting hard to stay there for four more years. Because of reapportionment, 
the veteran lawmaker is running in partially new territory that is not nearly 
as friendly as his old district. Cohen, a Redondo Beach attorney, is urging 
voters to send new blood to the capital. The key to the race is whether 
Democrats stay loyal to their party stalwart or get on the anti-incumbent 
bandwagon. CONGRESS/24th District 
</P>
<P>
 Area: Malibu, Calabasas, Reseda, Thousand Oaks, Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 50% Democrat, 37% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 CANDIDATES 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat: Anthony C. Beilenson, 61, congressman. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican: Rich Sybert, 42, businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 Libertarian: John C. Koehler, 24, small-business developer. 
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 In possibly his toughest campaign since he first went to Washington 18 years 
ago, Beilenson faces a well-financed GOP opponent and a national anti-incumbent 
clamor. Sybert, a former top aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, has had fund-raising 
help from national Republican leaders. But Beilenson, a senior member of the 
powerful House Rules Committee, is a veteran campaigner who knows his affluent 
district well. Pundits predict a tight race. CONGRESS/29th District 
</P>
<P>
 Area: Beverly Hills, Hollywood, Santa Monica, West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 59% Democrat, 26% Republican 
</P>
<P>
 CANDIDATES 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat: Henry A. Waxman, 55, congressman. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican: Paul Stepanek, 33, businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 Libertarian: Michael J. Binkley, 48, software engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman, a powerful House player with a title role in the now-moribund 
Berman-Waxman political machine, is running for his 11th term with a political 
record and campaign bankroll that should make his seat one of the safest in the 
nation. Strategists give Stepanek, a political novice, little hope of making a 
dent in Waxman's support in the affluent, heavily Democratic district. 
CONGRESS/32nd District 
</P>
<P>
 Area: Crenshaw, Culver City, Exposition Park, Mar Vista, Palms. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 77% Democrat, 13% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 CANDIDATES 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat: Julian C. Dixon, 60, congressman. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican: Ernie A. Farhat, 53, businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace and Freedom: John Honigsfeld, 52, teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 The core of Dixon's district remains the predominantly black, upper- and 
middle-class neighborhoods that have helped send him to Washington for eight 
terms. Farhat, president of a Marina del Rey commercial real estate firm, 
decided to challenge Dixon after Republicans failed to field a candidate in 
1992. Analysts say Farhat hasn't much chance against Dixon, whose reputation is 
unblemished and will benefit by the district's overwhelming voter registration. 
CONGRESS/36th District 
</P>
<P>
 Area: Venice, Westchester, Marina del Rey, El Segundo, Hermosa Beach, Lomita, 
Manhattan Beach, Palos Verdes Peninsula, Redondo Beach, San Pedro, Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration: 43% Democrat, 42% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 CANDIDATES 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat: Jane Harman, 49, congresswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican: Susan M. Brooks, 44, Rancho Palos Verdes councilwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Libertarian: Jack Tyler, 33, engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 American Independent: Joseph G. Fields, 30. 
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 First-termer Harman is facing a serious challenge from Brooks, who lined up 
Senate GOP leader Robert Dole and other big-name Republicans to boost her 
campaign. Brooks is also counting on anti-incumbent sentiment. But Harman 
started the race with a much larger bankroll than Brooks, who barely won a 
tough primary contest. Moreover, Harman has personal wealth at hand should her 
campaign need an infusion of cash. Neither candidate has a decisive advantage 
in this swing district.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRENSHAW; PRINCE TO MAKE A PIT STOP AT AUTO TRAINING CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When James Muse learned that Prince Charles planned to visit his class at the 
Toyota Automotive Training Center, the first thought that popped into his mind 
was, "Why?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't understand why he'd come here, to the inner city," said Muse, a 
genial man dressed in the customary blue work clothes of center trainees. 
</P>
<P>
 Muse and his fellow classmates will get the rare chance to meet the Prince of 
Wales on Tuesday, when he and his royal entourage make a pit stop at the 
training center at 3833 S. Crenshaw Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The news came as something of a shock to most of the 14 students who will be 
present, who say that although the heir to the British throne is hardly part of 
their lunch break conversations, the prospect of entertaining an 
internationally known figure is indeed exciting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope he's friendly," Muse said with a laugh after learning that the prince 
plans to tour the facility and question his class of brake and suspension 
students about their work." The 2-year-old center, operated jointly by Toyota 
Motor Corp. and the Los Angeles Urban League, has trained about 150 students in 
auto repair, including tuneups, smog exams, brakes and suspensions, and exhaust 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Its high percentage of job placement -- all members of the last graduating 
class found full-time employment -- caught the attention of Prince Charles' 
delegation, Toyota spokeswoman Nancy Hubbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the British Consulate toured the center last summer and were 
impressed enough to return two months ago and settle on it as an official stop 
during the prince's Los Angeles visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prince Charles has a real interest in vocational schools and educational 
programs," Hubbell said. "The automotive training center seemed like a good 
example to (the British Consulate) of what's working here in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Center General Manager Joe Saia said that although he feels honored to be paid 
a royal visit, he is not planning on doing anything special. Prince Charles "is 
coming here to see us ," he said. "We're putting people to work. He can take 
what he sees here and duplicate it in other industries, other countries." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Parr said he is somewhat used to rubbing elbows with the 
politically famous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met Bill Clinton last year, and that was nice," the Los Angeles resident 
said. Prince Charles is "probably a regular guy who happens to live in a 
fishbowl." Muse said that central Los Angeles "isn't all shootings. The center 
is very clean and presentable, no graffiti. It's always that way. People just 
need to see how things are day-to-day here." 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Barraza, in his third week of study, said he never figured on getting an 
audience with such a famous person when he signed up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of excited," he said. "How many chances do you get to meet someone 
like this? Never. . . . I'm lucky to be in this class, at this time." ERIN J.

COVER STORY; AFTER THE BLOOM; CONCEIVED DURING '80S BUILDING BOOM, WATER GARDEN 
PROJECT REMAINS HALF-FINISHED, A SYMBOL OF RECESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By B.J. PALERMO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Jerome H. Snyder promised Santa Monica a water garden, it was during the 
mega-development boom of the 1980s, a time when a developer could begin 
erecting big buildings and worry about the financing and leases later. The 
Water Garden, three six-story office buildings and one five-story building 
surrounding a 1.4-acre artificial lake, was to house 4,900 employees and bring 
the city $1 million in taxes each year. Plans called for a 17-acre oasis where 
workers could stroll along tree-lined walkways and bridges, a place where "fish 
swim and water lilies flourish," the developer said. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly a decade of negotiations, the city in 1988 approved Snyder's 
plans for the $450-million project. 
</P>
<P>
 It was touted as Santa Monica's largest commercial development and an 
impressive addition to its new office district near Colorado and Olympic 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder also made expensive concessions to the city. He promised to install 
equipment on the site to treat sewage and recycle water. To prevent traffic 
congestion, a transportation plan for employees was to be included. And he 
agreed to pay Santa Monica millions for low-cost housing, public parks, street 
improvements, programs for the homeless and public art. 
</P>
<P>
 The sky was the limit -- and so, it turned out, were the two Water Garden 
office buildings that opened in 1992. Two years later, the lavish project 
remains only half-finished, a prime example of development projects in Los 
Angeles that burst on the scene in the 1980s only to be stunted by recession 
and a sudden end to easy credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recession killed new development of all types in this city," said Kenyon 
Webster of Santa Monica's Planning and Zoning Division. "A number of projects 
died that had gotten city approvals and had certain time limits because they 
were unable to get financing. And commercial and office development was the 
most affected. There have been virtually no new projects applied for in the 
last few years." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, J.H. Snyder Co., like some other local developers, has weathered 
the economic climate with the kinds of adjustments that have characterized 
commercial development in the 1990s. It is a landscape in which banks 
foreclose, properties change hands, partnerships are reshuffled and visions are 
revised. 
</P>
<P>
 By the summer of 1989, Snyder had started excavating the site at Olympic 
Boulevard between 26th Street and Colorado Avenue. To pay for the construction 
of Phase One -- the first two buildings and the lake -- he became partners with 
financier Marvin Davis, whose real estate development firm, Miller-Klutznick 
Davis-Gray Co., secured a $230-million loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder calls the 667,000-square-foot result his "baby." Although Snyder has 
only a minor interest -- the project is controlled by Davis -- he walks with 
pride across the marble floor of one lobby, with its pillars and vaulted glass 
ceiling and its broad veranda overlooking the expansive lake and gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one's from Italy, and that one's from Brazil," he says, touching his toe 
to the varieties of inlaid marble in the floor. "We've had sit-down dinners for 
300 people in these lobbies." 
</P>
<P>
 The directories list prominent tenants, among them RAND, software giants 
Candle Corp. and Microsoft, and the law firm of Haight, Brown & Bonesteel. 
There is an upscale child-care center and a large health club. Roving teams of 
security guards in blue blazers ensure the privacy of tenants in the two 
buildings, which are 98% leased. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the turquoise-and-peach decor of the lobbies and the buildings they 
join lies a watery scene with splashing fountains, concrete islands filled with 
flowers, and gardens beneath palm trees and weeping willows. The promised 
public improvements, including the water recycling and sewage treatment 
facilities, were completed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the lavish development abruptly ends at a field of weeds. The vacant lot 
stretches from Cloverfield Boulevard along Colorado to the edge of a ravine, 
revealing the subterranean parking structure beneath the lake, its gazebo and 
fountains, and the two completed buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The empty field is all there is of Phase Two. Construction of the remaining 
two buildings was to begin this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no financing problems in 1989 or 1990. But by 1992, the market was 
awful," Snyder said. "We had no financing commitments for Phase Two because we 
didn't have the tenants." 
</P>
<P>
 With no tenants signed up and payments on a $45-million loan overdue, 
California Federal Bank foreclosed on the undeveloped land in March, although 
the land was reacquired when Snyder found new partners, including a subsidiary 
of a Korean real estate conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
 A changed economy had lowered rents, dashing the financing prospects for major 
commercial developers. And lenders had become much more conservative, demanding 
greater equity and requiring that buildings be leased in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they started building the Water Garden, it was an 'up' market, and the 
market changed on them while they were in construction. Once you start (on a 
project phase), you keep going," said Vincent Muselli, a commercial realtor in 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 One Water Garden tenant, the upscale Opus restaurant, claims that delays in 
leasing Phase One and the suspension of Phase Two construction destroyed its 
business. The owners, L'Orfeo Partners, are suing Davis' and Snyder's firms, 
claiming they signed a 10-year lease in 1991 based on false promises. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a right to get out of the lease because they fraudulently induced us 
to get into it," said Bryan King Sheldon, a West Los Angeles attorney 
representing the restaurant. "They really didn't tell the truth about what they 
were going to build. The representation made to my clients was that Marvin 
Davis was financially backing this." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, the Opus owners claim they 
lost $1.4 million and also are seeking punitive damages, accusing the Water 
Garden's partners of fraud, negligent misrepresentation and breach of contract. 
In turn, Water Garden Associates is suing L'Orfeo for $3 million in unpaid 
rent, attributing the restaurant's closure last summer to poor management. 
"They're just trying to blame someone else for their high prices and their 
failure," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis was committed only to the Water Garden's initial phase. A spokesman for 
Davis' development firm would say only that the financier could have provided 
loans for Phase Two but decided not to exercise his option to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder, faced with the difficulty of finding financing for office buildings, 
adapted by negotiating to make Phase Two a 600,000-square-foot wholesale 
clothing outlet rather than office buildings. About 200 tenants of the 
California Mart in Downtown Los Angeles had chosen to move to the Water Garden 
to escape high rents and urban blight. But Snyder was unable to secure loans 
for the project, and the plan was abandoned last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 If the 1980s were the heyday of large-scale projects, they also evoked the 
anti-development sentiments of residents who battled increased traffic and 
pollution and the additional burden on public facilities. But the recession 
spoke louder than all the angry voices at public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Homeowners and politicians who objected to those projects are having their 
way because of the economy," Muselli said. "A lot of people think the status 
quo in Santa Monica is just fine. There are a lot of homeowners who would 
prefer not to see Water Garden Phase Two built." 
</P>
<P>
 The millions Snyder spent on public improvements to appease the 
anti-development faction was the price he paid, as a major developer, for doing 
business in the boom era. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an impediment, from the standpoint that it drives up the costs," 
Muselli said. "You can't keep piling on these costs -- development fees, 
in-lieu fees, traffic mitigation fees -- and expect things to happen. It's not 
going to work anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 For some developers elsewhere on the Westside, community opposition was either 
insurmountable or caused costly delays. The massive Playa Vista project, for 
example, endured 4 1/2 years of environmental reviews required by government 
regulations and fueled by community opposition, while the economy, and the 
chance to obtain financing, changed. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer, Maguire Thomas Partners, has had to reconsider the original 
plans for 3,247 housing units, 1.5 million square feet of office space, 35,000 
square feet of retail space and a 300-room hotel, a project that would stretch 
from Playa del Rey west to the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The project's emphasis now is on the more easily financed housing units. The 
developers say the delay might have saved the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Water Garden was being built during the tough times," said Doug Gardner, 
vice president of Maguire Thomas. "We haven't even started yet. But if we had 
started three years ago, it might have been a different story." 
</P>
<P>
 It might have resembled the story of the Arboretum, a plan for more than 1 
million square feet of offices and a hotel across Cloverfield from the 
undeveloped half of the Water Garden. Now the property contains only some 
temporary units used by small businesses and is circled by a chain-link fence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most developers got hurt by the office buildings," Muselli said. "They would 
be into them for $150 a square foot, and now they're selling for $70 to $80 a 
square foot. Very successful, major companies with a lot of cash and ability to 
get financing will be the ones to make it happen. The small guys who are trying 
to become big guys will have trouble doing that." 
</P>
<P>
 After two sales and a foreclosure, the new Arboretum owner, the Berkeley-based 
TransAction Financial Corp., has drastically changed the plans. The new 
configuration, if approved by the city, will consist of a supermarket and 
retail space instead of the hotel, and either condominiums and apartments or 
offices, depending on what the market will support. The project is scheduled to 
go before the Santa Monica City Council in November. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, developers and financiers are looking to single-tenant 
projects such as supermarkets and built-to-order offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are working on Alpha Beta food markets," said Milton Swimmer, a partner in 
J.H. Snyder Co. "We didn't specifically decide to go into the market business, 
but we can make them happen and get them financed. They have a single tenant 
who signs the lease in advance." 
</P>
<P>
 J.H. Snyder Co. recently substituted a supermarket for a 315,000-square-foot 
office building at Marina Point, on Lincoln Boulevard south of Washington 
Boulevard in Marina del Rey. And it is building another supermarket at Fountain 
and LaBrea avenues in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Although lending terms have changed the development landscape, builders and 
investors are encouraged by the first hints of an improved economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Major banking investment houses in real estate advise us on a regular basis 
that capital is returning to the office building business," said Bob Bisno, 
chief executive officer of TransAction Financial. "Vacancies in the Santa 
Monica market are single digit, and vacancies on the Westside are shrinking to 
10 digits. In the next three to four years you will actually see shortages of 
office space." 
</P>
<P>
 So optimistic are Bisno and Snyder that they have become partners in Phase Two 
of the Water Garden. In September, their two companies joined K. Young Cos., a 
subsidiary of Korean real estate giant Kunyoung, in buying the foreclosed land 
for $5 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although they still hope to add two more buildings to the Water Garden 
project, the financing terms are challenging. Gone is the era of speculative 
building, or loans based on commitments by only 30% of the future tenants. 
Instead, they must sign up 70% of the tenants in advance, or build to suit a 
company with vast space requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a request for proposal from one of the country's largest media 
companies for 500,000 square feet built to suit," said Bisno, who declined to 
say which company has made the inquiry. "If you would look for a 
200,000-square-foot block of space on the Westside, I don't think you could 
find one, and there are fewer than four 100,000-square-foot properties west of 
the 405." 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder said he and his partners have been negotiating with three major 
entertainment and news media companies, including a newspaper, for Phase Two of 
the Water Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we bought (Phase Two of) the Water Garden was we noted the 
significant improvement in both the retail and office markets," Bisno said. 
"Had we not seen so much positive activity on the Arboretum, we would not have 
bought the Water Garden." 
</P>
<P>
 It will be two or three years before their vision is realized, the partners 
said. But their development agreement with the city does not expire until 2000. 
And Snyder remains undaunted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will work out," he said. "We own it. We're stuck with it."

FOR SENIORS: NURSE EASES MISERY OF RWANDAN REFUGEES 
</P>

<P>
 Ellen Neiman was at a point in her life when other women might consider 
retirement, golf and baby-sitting. She is devoted to her six grandchildren, but 
she's also driven by an inner curiosity and a need for definition -- about 
herself and for her world. So, she started with her own heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Neiman, a nurse, had no idea that when she began exploring her faith, Judaism, 
she would also be guided by the philosophy of tikkun olam -- healing the world. 
</P>
<P>
 It led her to Ethiopia in 1992, where she ran a crafts project with the North 
American Conference on Ethiopian Jewry. She wanted to become more familiar with 
Ethiopian Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no 'us' and 'them' anymore -- it's all us," Neiman, 61, said from her 
home in Mar Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there was no opportunity to do any medical work in Ethiopia, the 
experience eventually led her to one of the hottest of the world's hot spots -- 
the Rwandan refugee camps in Zaire. During her trip to Ethiopia, she met 
Richard Hodes, a member of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, a 
worldwide rescue and relief agency. As a result, she was invited earlier this 
year to join a five-person team headed by Hodes to provide medical aid to the 
Rwandan refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been having this incredible urge to go as soon as the news carried the 
story about the civil war in Rwanda, and then the Los Angeles Times ran a story 
on Aug. 10 that put me over the edge. I saw these pictures of the children, and 
two weeks later I was on a plane bound for Goma, Zaire," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neiman spent a month in Zaire. She is back home now, with a stack of 
photographs of the Hutu people she nursed and a detailed journal of her time 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 When she arrived at a refugee camp, firefighters from San Francisco had 
cleaned up the water system, so she didn't see people stricken by cholera. But 
she did arrive in time for an epidemic of shigellosis, a devastating bacterial 
illness that causes bloody diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first sight of the camp (was) the hundreds and hundreds of huts barely 
high enough for a person to stand up in," Neiman said. "The lucky ones had (a 
hut) covered in plastic. I was shocked to see so many people walking and so 
many dead bodies left alongside the roads. So many beautiful children, so lost, 
so sick. I cried a lot. But I never thought of coming home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I cried was on the second night when I was told about the 
volcano. The government of Zaire had designated the land below an active 
volcano for the refugees. It could not be farmed, and at any moment (the 
volcano) could erupt. We either had six to 12 hours to move everyone out or no 
time. That's how tenuous it was. I did ask myself, 'What am I doing here?' 
There were 180,000 Hutus in our camp, Kibumba. The medical and sanitary team 
stayed in a house in Goma because it was not safe for us around the camp at 
night." 
</P>
<P>
 Neiman says she pushed away the danger and fear because she felt protected by 
one essential fact. "I was doing good work." 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, there were the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, when they looked at my face, they burst into tears. They were 
afraid of us. It didn't make me feel terrible. I felt wonderful the first time 
they said 'thank you' or smiled at me, and especially when they got better." 
</P>
<P>
 On the third day, the medical team pitched a tent and opened a makeshift 
clinic. Neiman treated victims of skin diseases, lice, infections, pneumonia, 
mumps, malaria and worms. The last 10 days were devoted to teaching the 
refugees to take over their own health care. "When I left, it was really the 
beginning for them," Neiman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Emboldened by her experience in Zaire, Neiman, who for the past year has been 
a part-time lecturer at the USC Department of Nursing, is now looking for a job 
in family practice medicine and wants to keep talking about the experience with 
groups who are interested. She is also continuing her work as a board member 
with Clinica Para Las Americas, an organization that provides health care to 
underserved communities in central Los Angeles. She hopes her experience there 
will help her in the event of any future emergencies abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm going to do any refugee work, I want to be able to speak directly to 
the people and not through a translator. So if there is another worldwide 
emergency, in the Spanish-speaking world, I would go," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, she will practice tikkun olam at home. "This is what we are 
supposed to be doing as a people," she said.

$25K RENT FACT FOR 'FICTION' STAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 JOHN TRAVOLTA -- who co-stars with Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman and Samuel L. 
Jackson in the black comedy "Pulp Fiction" -- and his wife, actress KELLY 
PRESTON, have leased a Beverly Hills home for nine months at about $25,000 a 
month, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The gated, Tudor-style home had been on the market at just under $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Travolta, 40, is in the Los Angeles area to make two films: "White Man's 
Burden," a low-budget independent feature being produced by "Pulp Fiction" 
director Quentin Tarantino's film company, and then "Get Shorty," about a loan 
shark who goes to Hollywood to collect money from a producer and ends up being 
partners with him on a film about his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Travolta is said to have made a career comeback in "Pulp Fiction," in which he 
plays a fast-talking, heroin-addicted hit man. Because of the role, he got the 
"Get Shorty" part and what is reported to be his highest upfront salary -- 
about $3.5 million plus a $750,000 bonus if he is an Academy Award nominee for 
"Pulp Fiction" and $750,000 if he wins the Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the hottest movie stars of the '70s, Travolta starred in "Saturday 
Night Fever" and "Grease" before "Urban Cowboy (1980) and then some 
less-than-stellar films. The popular "Look Who's Talking" movies (1989, 1990, 
1993) did not restore him to dramatic lead status. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Preston, who co-starred in the movie "Run" (1991), were married three 
years ago, and they have a young son, Jett, named for Travolta's hobby -- he 
owns and flies three jets and keeps his two smaller ones in a hangar behind his 
house in Daytona Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Travolta, who also has a home in Carmel and another one on an island off the 
coast of Maine, once had a 17-acre ranch just north of Los Angeles but sold it 
in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beverly Hills house he is leasing has four bedrooms, seven baths, an 
office and maid's quarters in slightly more than 7,500 square feet. Built in 
1926, the home was "recently remodeled, down to the studs," a source said. 
</P>
<P>
 HOWARD KEEL, one of the biggest musical stars of MGM's Golden Era who appeared 
earlier this year in the TV movie "Hart to Hart: Home Is Where the Hart Is," 
and his wife, Judy, have put their home of nearly 20 years, in Sherman Oaks off 
of Mulholland Drive, on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Keel, who played Clayton Farlow in the "Dallas" TV series, co-starred with 
Kathryn Grayson in director George Sidney's 1953 musical "Kiss Me Kate" and 
co-starred with Jane Powell in Stanley Donen's 1954 musical "Seven Brides for 
Seven Brothers." 
</P>
<P>
 The Keels are selling their home because they have a vacation home in 
Telluride, Colo., and a home they just bought in Palm Desert, which they want 
to make their permanent residence. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loves Palm Desert, and he loves golf, which he plays there," said Cissy 
Wellman-Guydus of Jon Douglas Co.'s Bel-Air office. Wellman-Guydus, whose 
father -- the late Oscar-winning William Wellman -- directed Keel in the 1951 
movie "Across the Wide Missouri," has the Sherman Oaks listing at $895,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1958, the Sherman Oaks home, which has a 180-degree view of the San 
Fernando Valley, was expanded and remodeled in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-bedroom, 4,600-square-foot house has a Cape Cod exterior and a 
contemporary interior, with an open floor plan featuring a 2,000-square-foot 
great room, which houses the kitchen, living, family and dining areas. An 
octagonally shaped bar in marble and wood can accommodate more than a dozen 
people, Wellman-Guydus said. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis Cardinals' third baseman TODD ZEILE and his wife, 1984 Olympics Gold 
Medalist gymnast JULIANNE McNAMARA, are building a home in the Santa Clarita 
Valley, where he grew up and attended school. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected to be completed in time for Christmas at a cost of $1 million, the 
three-story, 7,500-square-foot house will have tennis and basketball courts, a 
gym, game room and pool. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a chair in the shape of a big baseball glove in the game room, 
which will also have a pool table and high-tech audio visual equipment, said 
Jeanne James, who is designing the interiors with Hydee Hirschmann, her partner 
in their newly formed Creative Lifestyles of Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeile, in his late 20s, was a standout catcher at his high school and at UCLA 
before he signed with the Cardinals in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 McNamara won a gold and two silver medals in the '84 Olympics and was, next to 
Mary Lou Retton, the best-known beam and floor exercise competitor of the 
Games. She even defeated Retton in the uneven parallel bars, which is the event 
in which McNamara won her gold medal.

ON THEIR OWN; DISABLED BUY HOMES WITH HELP FROM THEIR PARENTS AS KEY TO FUTURE 
SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA HENNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Henning is a Long Beach free-lance 
writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
 In his quiet moments, Bob Goldstone is haunted by an admittedly irrational but 
visceral fear. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palos Verdes Peninsula realtor imagines that after he dies his mentally 
impaired adult son will be left to wander the streets alone. And because no one 
gives him his medications, he succumbs to epileptic seizures. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm gone, it's permanent," Goldstone said. "I can't come back for 
another day and take care of this person. I have to do what I can for him now." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of adult children with disabilities such as mental retardation, autism 
and cerebral palsy live with these kinds of concerns every day: 
</P>
<P>
 When they're gone, who will watch over their children? Will they have jobs? 
Opportunities to socialize? Food on the table? Health care? Will they be safe? 
</P>
<P>
 Some Southland parents of disabled adult children are tackling their biggest 
worry -- where will their children live -- in an innovative way. 
</P>
<P>
 They are convinced that the purchase of permanent housing for their adult 
children is the key to both their future security and self-sufficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 Group homes, one of the most popular living arrangements for the disabled, are 
too impermanent, the parents believe, and stifle their children's independence. 
</P>
<P>
 So in 1989 about two dozen parents formed a nonprofit group in Culver City 
called Home Ownership Made Easy (HOME). With federal and local grants they buy 
housing that is then rented at low rates to their children and to other persons 
with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 And a group of Torrance-area parents is going beyond buying rental homes for 
their disabled adult children. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit group Home Ownership for Personal Empowerment (HOPE) will guide 
persons who have mental disabilities through the maze of actually purchasing 
their own homes or condos themselves. No homes have been purchased, but they 
have several candidates for homeownership. 
</P>
<P>
 And other parents acting on their own, like Long Beach resident Candy Kimble, 
have bought homes for their disabled adult children and established them in 
separate households. 
</P>
<P>
 HOME, the older of the two housing groups, has purchased a Culver City duplex 
and a four-plex in the Fairfax District of Los Angeles accommodating 14 
disabled tenants. Rents range from $187 to $237 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also has received a $500,000 grant from HUD to purchase four more 
condos in Inglewood and is applying for a $1 million HUD grant for 20 more 
housing units in Culver City, Hawthorne, Santa Monica and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 HOME's purchase of the Culver City and Fairfax buildings was preceded by lots 
of legwork and struggles with red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 HOME members visited a variety of neighborhoods, said board member Rob Dodson, 
looking for safe, clean areas that are close to public transportation and 
shopping. When they did find properties in a good area, the living units 
sometimes had to be gutted and retrofitted with a ramp and extra-wide doors to 
accommodate a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 Lining up the money to buy the properties can take longer than finding them -- 
months, even years. The parents often got lost in a maze of bureaucratic red 
tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for both the Culver City and Fairfax properties originated with HUD 
and in Culver City was funneled through the city's Community Redevelopment 
Agency. The duplex was purchased outright with a grant for $425,000. 
</P>
<P>
 HOME bought the Fairfax four-plex with a $200,000 grant from the Los Angeles 
Community Redevelopment Agency. It was matched with an equal amount from HUD, 
which was administered by the state Department of Housing and Community 
Development. The grants need not be repaid, but both the CRA and HUD said they 
check periodically to make sure the facility is being used as specified in the 
grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups such as HOPE and HOME are part of a growing trend across the country, 
according to Derrick Dufresne, president of Community Resource Associates, a 
St. Louis consulting firm that deals with housing issues of the disabled and 
the disadvantaged. 
</P>
<P>
 He said federal dollars are beginning to flow once again for the development 
of low-income housing, but this time federal officials are looking at "new and 
innovative ways to solve old housing problems." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, said Dufresne, states such as Texas, South Dakota, Michigan and 
Florida are using federal funds to establish agencies that are looking into 
progressive programs such as HOME and HOPE to address the need for affordable 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ohio and New Hampshire, residents with disabilities have already purchased 
some 50 units, ranging from condos and houses to mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Dufresne predicts that such efforts are "just the first ripple in a huge wave" 
of disabled-owned housing that will sweep the country.  
</P>
<P>
 The concept was introduced in California a half-dozen years ago by Mike 
Danneker, the director of the Westside Regional Center in Culver City, one of 
21 state-supported agencies scattered across California dispensing services to 
persons with developmental disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by a seminar on independent living for the disabled, he applied for 
and received state funds to start a pilot program that would address the 
housing needs of the handicapped. The HOME project was born. 
</P>
<P>
 "The developmentally disabled are just like anybody else," Danneker said. 
"They have abilities and we're trying to give them opportunities to contribute 
to society. We're teaching them how to take care of themselves rather than our 
taking care of them." 
</P>
<P>
 However, he abhors the creation of what he calls "developmentally disabled 
ghettos" -- buildings where all the occupants are handicapped. Instead, HOME's 
future units will be scattered through large condo complexes and neighborhoods 
of single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea, however, is not to place the disabled in housing and then forget 
them. An elaborate support system coordinated by the Westside Regional Center 
makes their independent living possible. Social service agencies such as Life 
Steps, Independent Focus and Project Live offer training in housekeeping, money 
management and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to make it fun," Philip Pacheco said of Life Steps' tutoring of 
clients in the basics of cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 And, he said, preparing a meal touches many other important skills areas, such 
as the use of public transportation to the supermarket, choosing healthy foods, 
appropriate behavior in public and money handling. 
</P>
<P>
 Life Steps even provides counselor Doris Bubis to help with roommate problems. 
She was visiting the other afternoon with Robin Stevens and Kathy Salter, who 
live in HOME's Fairfax duplex. They are both 31 years old and have mental 
disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Bubis was helping Stevens, a shy young African-American woman, to handle her 
roommate's temper tantrums, which make Stevens withdraw. Bubis emphasized that 
coping on her own is part of independent living. 
</P>
<P>
 "Independence also means paying rent, paying the bills," Bubis added. "At home 
Robin's parents did everything for her. Independence is about making decisions 
about how to spend money, what type of person she wants to be, what's in her 
best interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robin can't always call her parents to take care of her. I'm trying to get 
her to be confident about her ability to live on her own." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens and Salter, who is assertive and outspoken, have been sharing their 
sunny, simply furnished, two-bedroom apartment for the past year and a half. A 
large poster of Michael Jackson adorns Stevens' bedroom wall and her walk-in 
closet bulges with clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have a chance to make my bed yet," the young woman admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day she takes a bus to UCLA where she works on a grounds crew. Salter 
works at a Friends of Animals shelter. In the evening, she enjoys Stevens' 
cooking, including spaghetti and fried chicken. Salter budgets the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their occasional spats, Salter says she and her roommate are well 
matched. "She likes the Jackson Five; I like the Jackson Five. We like the 
'Partridge Family,' 'I Love Lucy' and 'The Flintstones.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Salter said she would never return to her old board-and-care home. Now she 
says she is no longer bossed around or has to worry about a roommate taking her 
clothes. But best of all, she has her own room. "Now I'm not bothered by people 
who want to go to bed early," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that just two decades ago young women like these might have been 
relegated to an institution, their independent living is testimony to the 
extraordinary strides that have been made in the lives of the developmentally 
challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 However, HOME board member Rob Dodson said a reviving real estate market in 
Southern California may make this lifestyle increasingly difficult to attain.  
</P>
<P>
 The buildings that HOME buys require long escrow periods while the 
bureaucratic red tape snarling the money is untangled. A long escrow was fine 
in a slow market, Dodson said, when sellers were willing to wait, but now they 
may be more impatient. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the HOPE project may face the same problem, because, while the 
group intends to help disabled individuals to purchase single-family homes, not 
multifamily units, unwinding the red tape and securing financing will still 
take a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 HOPE director Lisa Shaevitz said the group plans to walk clients and their 
families through the complicated process of assembling a financing package. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to just hand them application forms to fill out and telephone 
numbers and leave them on their own," Shaevitz said. "I've been researching 
this area for two years, and I still can't understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 To help sort out the confusion, the Harbor and Westside Regional centers are 
discussing the possibility of jointly hiring a coordinator specializing in the 
financing of home purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaevitz said the funding packages will consist of low-cost bank loans and 
grants from foundations and HUD to cover a down payment. Clients' Supplemental 
Security Income, which for a single adult living on his or her own is $748, 
will go toward the monthly mortgage payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaevitz emphasized that the HOPE project "is not a giveaway." The families 
will be required to make a modest financial commitment, 3% of the purchase 
price, toward the down payment. 
</P>
<P>
 HOPE hopes to help people like Allison Rivers. The 9-year-old, who has a 
mental disability, currently lives in a group home because of medical problems. 
However, her parents, Don and Susan Rivers of Lakewood, will be working with 
HOPE to purchase a house for her. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Rivers, a business executive, explained that the house would probably at 
first be owned by HOPE until his daughter reaches 18, when her name could be 
put on the deed. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Rivers, a homemaker, said they would have more control over their 
daughter's life if she lived in her own house. While she would have a live-in 
care-giver, the parents would be able to choose her roommates and the programs 
that will benefit her. 
</P>
<P>
 They also would feel more comfortable visiting any time they wished. "There 
would just be fewer rules," Susan Rivers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Candy Kimble, whose daughter has Down's Syndrome, knows well the benefits of 
independent living that the Rivers' are looking forward to. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago -- long before HOPE or HOME were started -- the Long Beach 
resident used her own money to buy a home for her developmentally delayed 
daughter, Carrin Alba. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimble found a four-bedroom home in a pleasant, blue-collar Norwalk 
neighborhood. The property was rundown and overgrown with weeds. She saw its 
possibilities, but before she bought it she knocked on the door of every 
neighbor asking if they had objections to her daughter living on the block. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want her moving in and their saying, 'We don't want her here,' " 
said Kimble, a retired special education teacher. There were no objections. 
</P>
<P>
 Alba, 34, has fashioned an extraordinarily independent life. She is a 
teacher's aide in a nursery school and goes to Cerritos College twice a week to 
polish up her independent living skills. 
</P>
<P>
 She cooks, cleans, sweeps the porch and takes out the trash, "only at a little 
slower pace than we do," said her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Now all she needs is a roommate. Her previous one, who lived with her for 
eight years, left when her parents moved to the San Diego area. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile Alba thrives on her own. Kimble said her daughter once told her, 
"I'm like everybody else. I want to live by myself because I'm not young and I 
don't need my Mom." 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of independence is the goal of the parents of the HOPE and HOME 
projects. They have a deep feeling that their children are capable of living on 
their own, with help. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not always easy, as the father of Robin Stevens said: "It's hard to let 
go, but you know you won't always be there to help them." 
</P>
<P>
 "Independent living changes people's lives," added Mike Danneker, the director 
of the Westside Regional Center. "It makes people feel better. You see people 
taking care of themselves and living on their own and contributing to the 
community. That's what's beautiful." Where to Call 
</P>

Danneker at Home Ownership Made Easy, (310) 337-1155, Ext. 519, or Lisa 
Shaevitz at Home Ownership for Personal Empowerment, (310) 540-1711, Ext. 401.

THE INDOOR GARDENER; TIPS ON HOW TO WINTERIZE YOUR HOUSEPLANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOEL RAPP, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Rapp is a Los Angeles free-lance writer 
who, as Mr. Mother Earth, has written several best-selling books on indoor 
gardening. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Winter is a-comin' in -- and that means it's time to "winterize" your 
houseplants. 
</P>
<P>
 We in Southern California tend to scoff at the idea of "winter," but our 
houseplants take this season from November through March very seriously. 
Shorter days, little or no sunlight, colder nights and much less humidity in 
our homes make life difficult for almost all our indoor foliage and flowering 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some tips to help you get your little green companions through these 
upcoming dreary days. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring all plants indoors that have been outside on summer vacation. Because 
these plants have surely grown considerably over the past months and because 
there's no telling what types of pests may have settled on the foliage or 
invaded the soil, now's a good time to clean and repot them. This also applies 
to any plants that have remained indoors but have been situated near an open 
window. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want a plant to go back into the same pot, discard the old soil and 
scrub the pot with hot, soapy water to eliminate all pests. Cut back about 
one-quarter of the roots (no, this will not hurt or shock the plant) with sharp 
scissors and then repot it in fresh, sterilized commercial potting mix. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want a plant to get larger when it starts growing again in the spring, 
leave the roots alone and repot the plant into a container no more than 2 or 3 
inches larger than its old one. 
</P>
<P>
 For those big trees in large pots such as palms and dracaenas, scoop away the 
top couple inches of old soil, aerate the top of the remaining soil with a 
hand-rake or a fork, then add a couple of inches of fresh soil to replace the 
old. 
</P>
<P>
 Clean your plants thoroughly to get off all the dust and dirt that's bound to 
have accumulated on the leaves whether the plants have been outside or in. If 
they've been outside, bathe them with a fine spray from your garden hose and 
then, as a final safety precaution against pests, spray them with a commercial 
insecticidal soap according to package directions. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the plants that have gathered summer dust indoors, spray them with a 
solution of one part mild dishwashing soap and 10 parts water, then spray with 
clear water, then wipe the leaves with a sponge or a soft paper towel. A clean 
plant is much more likely to be a healthy plant and will have a much better 
chance to survive the rigors of winter with minimal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut back vining plants such as wandering Jew, creeping Charlie or Swedish ivy. 
It's likely that these plants have grown straggly during the summer months, and 
a good haircut will energize then for a robust re-burgeoning come spring. 
Flowering plants such as azaleas and hibiscus should be pruned back now too. 
</P>
<P>
 Lack of humidity is a big problem in winter. What with most of us having to 
use our heaters at least at night, your plants can suffer greatly. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd suggest you get a couple of inexpensive humidifiers -- one to put in the 
room where most of your plants reside, and the other in your own bedroom. This 
extra humidity is very beneficial both to the well-being of your plants and 
you. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't want to invest in humidifiers, remember that even though your 
plants are dormant and not growing, they still need a regular misting to keep 
the tips from drying up. Try to travel around your "plant-tation" with a spray 
bottle at least three or four times a week. And be sure to keep your plants 
away from any direct exposure to dry heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Lack of light can be something of a problem during the winter months, 
especially for flowering plants such as African violets and those cactus and 
succulents that need lots of sunshine to do their best. If your violets stop 
blooming for a couple of months during the winters, fear not. It's simply a 
lack of light and they'll begin blooming again as the days grow longer and 
brighter. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the cacti and succulents, the fact that the plants are dormant 
compensates greatly for the lack of light and they'll make it through the 
winter with very little wear and tear. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, one of the great rewards of growing cactus is seeing those 
fabulous cactus flowers appear in spring, and the way to ensure your cactus 
will bloom is to take advantage of the chilly winter nights. The "secret": If 
possible, put your cactus plants in a place that gets really cold at night. The 
cold helps trigger a chemical reaction that will usually result in spring 
blooms. Most cacti and succulents will withstand temperatures as low as 30 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut back on watering and cut out feeding your houseplants during the winter. 
You'll have to water once in a while, but be sure and wait until your plant's 
soil has dried out completely before you water during this period. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of certain flowering plants whose normal growing season is 
winter, such as cyclamen, don't feed your plants during their dormant months. 
Begin a normal fertilizing regimen -- every other week with a good liquid 
houseplant fertilizer -- around the first of April.

REALTOR CONVENTION SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some 15,000 realtors are expected to attend the 87th annual convention and 
trade exposition of the National Assn. of Realtors, which opens Friday at the 
Anaheim Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The convention, with the theme "It's a Whole New World," will feature more 
than 80 education sessions for realtors, and forums on topics ranging from the 
latest in computer and business technology to brokerage management, sales and 
marketing, taxation and legal issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The focus on the high-tech side of today's business will provide realtors 
with a fantastic opportunity to enter the rapidly expanding information 
'superhighway,' " said convention chairman Chuck Lamb, of Century 21 Lamb in 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The keynote speaker for the convention will be former Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
 A highlight of the gathering will be the fifth annual International Real 
Estate Symposium, which will include a panel of major U.S. and international 
realty firms that have successfully expanded their businesses globally, a live 
international property auction and a session on the increasing use of 
international relocation services.

READERS' VIEW OF FORECLOSURE CHOICE: 'DEADBEAT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The difference between writer Cathy Curtis ("Her Mortgage Check Won't Be in 
the Mail," Oct. 16) and the rest of us who are in the same "upside-down" 
mortgage situation is a difference in values and moral integrity with regard to 
obligations. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis seems to feel that since she's in a situation she's not happy with (she 
made it clear that she wasn't financially desperate), a viable option is to 
stop making mortgage payments, let the bank foreclose and walk away with the 
"saved" mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
 What's wrong with this picture goes a long way toward explaining why lending 
institutions can't make "character loans" the way they used to, and why 
borrowers of good character have to pay relatively higher interest rates on 
loans and receive lower interest rates on deposits than in the "good old days." 
</P>
<P>
 Risk management becomes an impossible guessing game when professionals with 
previously good credit ratings and payment histories suddenly decide they can 
live with seven years of bad credit on their records because it's more 
convenient than honoring debts.

 No wonder there is a moral crisis in the United States. Our society makes it 
too easy to walk away from our commitments for even the most trivial reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 A lender can help a home buyer evaluate the pros and cons of buying a home, 
but cannot guarantee future value. The assumption that lenders can easily 
absorb these types of losses ignores the fact that the lenders' increased costs 
get passed back to all of us and affect the availability of credit.

 The article by Cathy Curtis is representative of the appalling absence of 
individual responsibility that undermines today's real estate market, not to 
mention society as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a trace of shame, Curtis details her scheme to walk away from her 
mortgage because "living far from friends, night life and good bookstores is a 
drag." This is outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
 Although her biggest concern is to get away with this fraud while minimizing 
the "awful repercussions" to her credit rating, Curtis might do well to 
contemplate the larger impact of her abdication.

 Poor Cathy Curtis! Imagine the incredible hardship of maintaining a big back 
yard and the unspeakable horror of having to drive a few extra miles to find a 
"good bookstore." Instead, why not rip off the lender? 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder if Curtis realizes she's also ripping off every socially responsible 
borrower who pays higher mortgage interest rates to offset lender losses caused 
by deadbeats such as herself?

 On Cathy Curtis' decision to renege on her mortgage debt: 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate has had a constant increase in Southern California for 50 years, 
yet she considers it a "feeble hope" that it will resume its appreciation after 
the present downturn ends. 
</P>
<P>
 Will she truly enjoy a "quality life" living in her house for six months and 
banking the payments she owes to her lender? Actually, she can probably stretch 
that by at least two more months by forcing the lender to evict after the 
foreclosure sale. That is what a deadbeat would do.

 Cathy Curtis wrote that the "bottom line" to negotiate a short sale with the 
lender is an "unavoidable hardship" on the part of the homeowner. This is not 
always the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-sale contracts that are correctly submitted to the right person, yet 
have little or no hardship, still have a chance of acceptance. The key is to 
negotiate and to give the lender what the lender wants: a performing loan and a 
promise the property will not be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 This means, in the simplest terms, immediately give the lender a short-sale 
offer that is acceptable and promise to carefully baby-sit the place until the 
new borrower takes over. In the process, point out to the lender their 
alternative: the expenses of foreclosing, plus losing 6-12 months payments and 
then risking costly vandalism while a broker tries to market an empty, 
unappealing house for a commission at the same reduced price that the short 
sale would have had anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 The article also mentioned that a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure "is not a viable 
option." Yet, in reality, deeds in lieu remain a very viable alternative to 
many homeowners.

 You have no valid reason in stopping your mortgage payments simply because 
your house is not worth what it once was (or is a drag).

 Foreclosure is an option for serious hardships and not for deadbeats such as 
yourself.

 What is forgotten is that when one signs a contract or shakes a hand, they 
give their word that they will do something in exchange for something else. The

coming up with hers?

 Even though my wife and I put 20% down on our own home and have prepaid on the 
principal, we'll be fortunate to sell without owing more. It's even more 
frustrating trying to compete in a market that is made even more competitive by 
homes that people have walked away from and which are aggressively priced by 
banks for quick sales.

 Curtis' articles reinforces my belief that foreclosure laws are unfair to 
those who have a sense of commitment to their word. She made a bad personal and 
business investment and is unwilling to accept the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 She somehow feels justified in using the fact that foreclosure laws that have 
been put in place to protect people make it too costly to pursue people like 
herself who should be pursued.

 Curtis' statement, "But I figure that the quality of my life has to be more 
important than the temporary status of my credit line" would more accurately 
state her attitude if she had said, "But I figure that the quality of my life 
has to be more important than my integrity and ethics."

 What the article failed to mention was that the Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
Corp. (FHLMC) and the Federal National Mortgage Assn. (FNMA) have increased 
their mortgage insurance requirements for homeowners on fixed-rate mortgages 
having a term greater than 20 years, and all adjustable-rate mortgages having a 
term greater than 20 years, and all adjustable-rate mortgages on loans with a 
loan to value greater than 80%. 
</P>
<P>
 That translates into higher housing costs for you and me. That's how they have 
chosen to handle the risks associated with these loans.

 What's missing in this article is the additional problems Curtis will cause 
her neighbors because of this decision. When a lender forecloses on a property 
they are under pressure to dispose of the house as soon as possible. This has a 
chilling effect on the values in the neighborhood and continues the downward 
pressure on home prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, a lender may not be located close to this property and its 
physical appearance will suffer as most lenders are hard pressed to show the 
same pride of ownership in maintaining the property as a homeowner.

GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week:  
</P>
<P>
 * Get rhododendrons and azaleas ready for winter by mulching heavily around 
their base. Two to three inches of organic compost should do it. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you haven't done so, install a drip irrigation system this autumn to give 
you better water management for spring and summer heat. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take care of roses this month. Remove dead wood, twiggy growth, damaged 
leaves or stems. These should all be bagged and taken to the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 * Replant your containers with winter blooming annuals and perennials. Your 
garden can be bright even on gloomy days. 
</P>
<P>
 * Remove tulips from the refrigerator and prepare bulb beds for planting. Use 
bone meal or a bulb fertilizer when planting them.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS: FREE ONLINE SERVICE FOR MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Travelers can now take the information superhighway to Mexico, thanks to a new 
free service called Mexico Online. 
</P>
<P>
 The service, offered by the Mexican Government Tourist Office, provides 
information on transportation, hotels, restaurants, festivals and attractions. 
There is also a library of travel articles that have appeared in newspapers, 
magazines and newsletters, and a sampling of travel books. Callers can ask 
questions, post messages, search for discount air fares and download travel 
information from the tourist office. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with a modem on a computer can log on by dialing (407) 582-7801. Users 
do not need to belong to any access service. Terminal 2 Opens at Frankfurt 
Airport 
</P>
<P>
 Frankfurt International Airport, second largest in Europe after London's 
Heathrow, has opened a new terminal housing 20 international airlines, 
including four U.S. carriers. Delta, Continental and Northwest moved into the 
new Terminal 2 last week and USAir is expected to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport, which gets scores of international flights every day, is likely 
to be the gateway to Germany for many travelers. About 32.5 million passengers 
per year, or 100,000 a day at peak periods, pass through its doors. 
</P>
<P>
 However, for another million tourists, the airport itself is a destination; in 
fact, it is Germany's second largest tourist attraction, trailing only the 
Neuschwanstein Castle near Munich as Germany's most popular tourist spot, 
according to airport officials. "With over 52,000 employees, restaurants and 
shops, the airport is a city in itself, and we get tourists like any other 
city," said Robert Payne, airport spokesman. Also, the airport's shops are open 
late and on Sundays, when all German stores are closed by law. McDonald's has 
built its largest restaurant in Germany at the airport. New Museum of the 
American Indian 
</P>
<P>
 The George Gustav Heye Center, the first of three branches that will 
eventually constitute the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of the 
American Indian, opens today in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum's collection of more than 1 million objects has been described as 
one of the most comprehensive collections of the indigenous peoples of the 
Western Hemisphere. It was assembled over 54 years, beginning in 1903, by 
George Gustav Heye, a New York banker. 
</P>
<P>
 Three inaugural exhibitions are on display at the center, which is housed in 
the historic Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House, next to Battery Park in 
Lower Manhattan. A series of free public programs, including dance and music, a 
powwow, theater performances, and film and video festivals are planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The three exhibits are: 
</P>
<P>
 "All Roads Are Good: Native Voices on Life and Culture," "Creation's Journey: 
Masterworks of Native American Identity and Belief," and "This Path We Travel: 
Celebrations of Contemporary Native American Creativity." 
</P>
<P>
 The museum, 3753 Broadway, is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and 
admission is free. For information, call (212) 283-2420.

TOURS & CRUISES: THE WARM, FUZZY FEEL OF A HARP SEAL PUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KARIN DOMINELLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Each March, 250,000 harp seals enter the Gulf of St. Lawrence to bear their 
young on the ice floes. Known as whitecoats, the pups shed their snowy white 
fur and turn gray within three weeks. Four six-day tours and one five-day tour 
to see the furry newborns begin Feb. 28 on the Magdalen Islands near Halifax, 
Nova Scotia. Participants take a helicopter to the ice floes, suit up in orange 
winter suits and warm boots and walk among the seals. Some pups approach 
inquisitively and roll on their backs to have their furry bellies petted. In 
1987, Canada banned the commercial hunting of whitecoats. The International 
Fund for Animal Welfare is working to create a tourist industry to boost the 
local economy to ensure that there is never a need to reinstate hunting.  
</P>
<P>
 Cost: from $1,695 per person, double occupancy, including air fare between 
Halifax and the Magdalen Islands, hotels, breakfasts daily and two dinners, 
services of a naturalist, slide shows and lectures, snowshoeing and hiking 
trips, outdoor gear and airport transfers. Not included: air fare to Halifax.

TOURS & CRUISES: THE WARM, FUZZY FEEL OF A HARP SEAL PUP 
</P>

 Each March, 250,000 harp seals enter the Gulf of St. Lawrence to bear their 
young on the ice floes. Known as whitecoats, the pups shed their snowy white 
fur and turn gray within three weeks. Four six-day tours and one five-day tour 
to see the furry newborns begin Feb. 28 on the Magdalen Islands near Halifax, 
Nova Scotia. Participants take a helicopter to the ice floes, suit up in orange 
winter suits and warm boots and walk among the seals. Some pups approach 
inquisitively and roll on their backs to have their furry bellies petted. In 
1987, Canada banned the commercial hunting of whitecoats. The International 
Fund for Animal Welfare is working to create a tourist industry to boost the 
local economy to ensure that there is never a need to reinstate hunting.  
</P>
<P>
 Cost: from $1,695 per person, double occupancy, including air fare between 
Halifax and the Magdalen Islands, hotels, breakfasts daily and two dinners, 
services of a naturalist, slide shows and lectures, snowshoeing and hiking 
trips, outdoor gear and airport transfers. Not included: air fare to Halifax.

BACKPACK & BUDGET: FREE GHOSTS WITH CASTLE DISCOUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Haunted hostels? Several in England and Wales have reputations for unusual 
occurrences. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the 11th and 14th centuries a number of castles were built to protect 
the borders between England and Wales. St. Briavel's Castle, which is in 
England's Wye Valley on the edge of the Forest of Dean, served as a Norman 
administrative center and a hunting lodge for King John. Today, it's a youth 
hostel that provides economical lodging for up to 60 travelers, and, some say, 
several ghosts. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the other-worldly activity is focused on a deep dungeon that can only 
be reached through a trap door in the floor of one of the dormitory rooms. Not 
only have travelers reported a feeling of oppression in the room, one manager's 
dog couldn't even be dragged into it. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that most sightings occur when renovations are going on in the 
building. This fall the hostel's kitchen is being refurbished. While the work 
has been in progress staff members have reported strange noises at night. And 
two young men, after a sleepless night, told of hearing tapping noises from 
beneath them and the sound of something heavy being dragged across the floor. 
They didn't know that they had been sleeping above the dungeon. They refused to 
stay in the room a second night. 
</P>
<P>
 Another incident occurred several years back when people in other dormitory 
rooms were awakened by screams coming from this room.  
</P>
<P>
 Three French cyclists were sleeping in the dormitory. One claimed he was 
awakened by a soldier in an ancient uniform who was dragging him from his bed 
toward the trap door. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Briavel's Castle is in the center of a quiet village seven miles from 
Lydney, Gloucester; telephone 011-44-594-530-272. Dormitory beds for travelers 
over 18 cost about $12 per night.  
</P>
<P>
 Saffron Walden Youth Hostel is located in the oldest building (15th Century) 
in a large Essex village. In the 16th Century the building was used for malting 
(where hops were prepared for beer). 
</P>
<P>
 The story is that the maltster was an alcoholic who left all the work to his 
wife, who did it but nagged him. One day, when she was putting barley straw on 
the floor in what is now dormitory room No. 1, he crept up behind her and 
removed some of the floor boards. When she turned to leave she fell through the 
hole and broke her neck. It was easy for the maltster to remove the boards 
because in the 16th Century, when there was a shortage of wood, people took 
their floorboards with them when they moved. This is where the saying "up 
sticks and move" comes from. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff say that her ghost can regularly be heard walking around between 
dormitories No. 1 and 2.  
</P>
<P>
 Saffron Walden Youth Hostel is located at 1 Myddylton Place, Saffron Walden, 
Essex, tel. 011-44-799-523-117. Dormitory beds for travelers over 18 cost $11 
per night. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheringham Youth Hostel is in the Norfolk coastline area, which is known for 
its beaches, dunes, cliffs and birds. The hostel itself is a Victorian building 
that was once a home for single Catholic mothers and belonged to the church 
next door. 
</P>
<P>
 The ghost is thought to be one of the nuns who used to live in the building. 
She is said to walk down the "nuns walkway" and to slam doors on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheringham Youth Hostel is at 1 Cremer's Drift, Sheringham, Norfolk; tel. 
011-44-263-823-215. Beds for travelers over 18 cost $12.  
</P>
<P>
 These hostels close for periods during the late autumn and early winter so if 
you are visiting before spring, check before going.

SYDNEY'S HIP SPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's downright discriminatory when articles such as Ken Baron's "Sydney's Hip 
Spot" (Sept. 25), keep invisible the large gay community that exists on the 
very street he focuses on. How can anyone write about Oxford Street and its 
neighborhoods without mentioning the open and significant gay stores, 
restaurants, nightclubs and street life (the world's largest gay event, Mardi 
Gras, occurs along Oxford Street every February)? How can any editor not be 
alert to these omissions? This would be similar to a story on Santa Monica 
Boulevard that does not mention the gay section of West Hollywood, or Castro 
Street in San Francisco and Christopher Street in New York.

 Editor's note: According to the Australian Tourist Commission, Paddington is 
one of several gay-friendly neighborhoods in Sydney. Oxford Street, which runs 
through Paddington, includes many gay-owned and gay-oriented businesses. But 
those businesses are concentrated along the stretch of Oxford Street that 
passes through the nearby Darlinghurst neighborhood, notes Danny Vadasz, 
publisher of Sydney-based OutRage Magazine, a leading Australian gay 
publication.

WALKING IN KYOTO

 In March we took a 12-day walking tour of Kyoto offered by Esprit Travel Corp. 
of Santa Monica that we read about in "Tours and Cruises" (Oct. 18, 1992). 
Guide Steve Beimel's knowledge of Japanese history and his insights on the 
temples, Zen gardens, shrines and pathways greatly enhanced our appreciation of 
Kyoto. We were able to explore many places.

ANOTHER SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding pickpocket scams ("News, Tips & Bargains," Oct. 2), let me tell 
about one that was tried on me last summer in Paris. While riding up one of the 
long escalators from the Paris subway, a well-dressed man came up alongside of 
me, stopped ahead of me and then moved directly in front of me as we got to the 
top.He then pretended to drop something and bent over, impeding my progress. At 
the same instant, his accomplice from behind had his hand in my pocket. I 
luckily managed to disentangle myself without any loss or injury. Incidentally, 
the fact that I had put a couple of rubber bands around my wallet so it 
wouldn't slip out so easily probably helped.

LYING IN PUBLIC LIFE: JUST WHOM DO YOU TRUST? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sissela Bok, Sissela Bok is the author of Lying: Moral Choice in Public & 
Private Life (Random House). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Election campaigns across the country are focusing, as never before, on lying. 
As voters confront the volleys of accusations and counteraccusations about 
fraud, broken promises and outright lies, many are tempted to throw up their 
hands. With trust in politics and politicians at an all-time low, and much vile 
campaign rhetoric eroding what little trust is left, it is easy for voters to 
conclude that all candidates are equally untrustworthy, that no distinctions 
can be made with respect to lying in politics and that the best thing to do may 
well be to follow the bumper-sticker advice: "Don't vote. It only encourages 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Virginia Senate race between Charles S. Robb and Oliver L. North casts the 
voters' bewilderment into sharp relief. Most know of the congressional and 
judicial record of North's lying during the Iran-Contra scandal, and most are 
familiar with allegations that Robb lied about his relationship with a former 
Miss Virginia and about attending parties where drugs were used. 
</P>
<P>
 After being pummeled by conflicting TV ads, many voters have decided both men 
are equally untrustworthy -- and equally unsuited for public office. In one 
poll, asking voters if they could trust either North or Robb to tell the truth, 
virtually the same percentage, about 58%, said they doubted either would tell 
the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 It is natural that a campaign where lying is daily imputed to each candidate 
should end generating such levels of distrust. Distrust of politicians is no 
different from distrust of anyone else: It stems from the suspicion that their 
word cannot be trusted -- that they will lie and break their promises as long 
as they think they can get away with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspicions about lying turn out to be central to everything else that 
candidates propose. Once their word is in doubt, none of their campaign 
promises -- about taxes, health care, crime, or any other issue -- can be taken 
at face value. 
</P>
<P>
 But however dismayed voters may be, they should not rush to conclude that no 
distinctions can be drawn between candidates with respect to their capacity to 
tell the truth. Instead, voters need to take certain questions into account: Is 
there a difference between lies that have been proved and lies that are only 
suspected? Does it matter if what is at issue is a single lie or a great many? 
Should deceit about a candidate's private life be thought as serious a handicap 
as deceit about conduct in public office? And are lies told under oath to cover 
up for violations of the law especially egregious? 
</P>
<P>
 These questions should be debated for they have clear answers that matter for 
purposes of voting. 
</P>
<P>
 A moment's reflection shows the absurdity of imagining that all candidates for 
public office are equally duplicitous and thus equally untrustworthy. While it 
is not always easy to resolve all questions to do with lying, some are too 
fundamental to the democratic process to be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, voters ought to weigh differently allegations that have and have not 
been proved. It is important to be careful in a climate in which the national 
media increasingly disseminate innuendo and unfounded rumors, and in which some 
political consultants encourage candidates to make exaggerated or completely 
unfounded accusations on the grounds that the election will be over before 
voters will learn all the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 An important distinction can be drawn, too, concerning the degree to which 
deceit has been shown to be a candidate's practice rather than a temporary 
lapse. Voters need only consider their own lives to acknowledge that everyone 
can make mistakes when it comes to truthfulness. They may be unsure about what 
is and is not a lie, and doubt that minor white lies matter much. They may feel 
caught by surprise in a situation where a lie seems unavoidable or be swayed by 
poorly understood temptations and a failure to think ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is another matter altogether to make the deliberate choice to be 
someone who deals with others through deceit; even more so when doing so 
involves numerous dealings with a great many persons over a long period of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 What about the significance of the sheer amount of deceit in which a candidate 
has engaged in the past? From the point of view of voters, any deception in 
public office undermines trust. When public representatives or Administration 
officials arrogate to themselves the right to lie, they take power from the 
public that would not have been given up voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 And deceit in campaigning cuts at the roots of what we mean by democracy and 
by its being founded on the consent of the governed. But when the deceit by 
public officials reaches proportions such as those that have come to light in 
the Watergate or the Iran-Contra scandals, there is reason for special caution 
on the part of voters. The resulting damage to public trust and to democratic 
institutions is deeper still and more lasting. So is the damage to the nation's 
reputation internationally. 
</P>
<P>
 It is especially shortsighted, therefore, for officials to claim patriotic 
justification for engaging in such practices. To the extent that voters have a 
say in how their government is run, they have to insist that true patriotism 
calls for honoring their nation's reputation for integrity both abroad and at 
home; and that candidates be aware of how much harder it will be to regain the 
trust underlying that reputation, once it has been lost, than it was to 
squander it in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of whether deceit about private life should be as serious a 
handicap as deceit about conduct in public life clearly troubles many voters -- 
and is the issue at the center of the Virginia Senate race. Robb has denied 
allegations of infidelity, and they have not been substantiated -- much less 
proven in court. But if they were substantiated, what difference should that 
make to voters? How should they weigh his denials as against the lies admitted 
by North? 
</P>
<P>
 Voters find themselves, here, in a double bind. On the one hand, they may well 
agree that political candidates, like all others, deserve some privacy. Many 
would also agree that marital relations ought to remain in that realm of 
privacy. Few would prize an inquisitorial society in which a citizen's most 
intimate concerns were made public record. Even though much of the public is 
fascinated by revelations about intimate concerns of public persons, they have 
no claim to a right to know about such matters. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, voters are inevitably faced, once there is clear evidence 
of false public statements on the part of a candidate, with questions about 
that candidate's trustworthiness. And so their doubts grow. Is it really worse 
to lie in the conduct of one's job than to one's spouse? Is it not an issue of 
character in either case? 
</P>
<P>
 This question cannot be dismissed out of hand. Clearly, most voters would 
prefer to be represented by persons who have not engaged in lying about either 
their private or their public conduct. At the same time, lies by public 
officials that violate their responsibility to all citizens simply cannot be 
equated -- from the point of view of electing someone to public office -- with 
lies concerning private matters. It would be wrong, therefore, to seize on the 
public discomfort regarding this question to argue that the best thing to do is 
to declare a pox on both houses and vote for neither. 
</P>
<P>
 This is especially true when the fourth question at issue in Virginia is taken 
into account -- about lying under oath to Congress concerning violations of the 
law. If such lying has been demonstrated, it should constitute an exceptionally 
important factor in the minds of voters. Every known society has formulated 
commandments or rules prohibiting the bearing of false witness.  
</P>
<P>
 To engage in such deception for purposes of covering up violations of the law 
has to be seen as especially grave in a democracy. A government under a 
Constitution cannot function adequately if officials in one branch of 
government cannot count on the accuracy of testimony by officials from another 
branch or on their honesty in respecting the laws they have sworn to carry out. 
</P>
<P>
 Wile it is true that lies under oath in all walks of life undercut trust, it 
is especially important for voters to guard against electing to public office 
candidates who have violated this most fundamental of standards. At the very 
least, they should demand clear evidence that candidates have understood the 
seriousness of such conduct and have made the strongest possible commitment not 
to engage in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a commitment is indispensable on the part of all who ask to be entrusted 
with public office. Public officials who engage in widespread deceit in the 
course of their official duties not only violate the public trust; they also 
abdicate their responsibility to set an example to subordinates and fellow 
citizens. As Justice Louis D. Brandeis wrote, government, for good or ill, 
"teaches the whole people by its example. If government becomes a law-breaker, 
it breeds contempt of the law: it invites every man to become a law unto 
himself. It invites anarchy."  
</P>
<P>
 We should expect our elected officials to shoulder this burden of teaching by 
example: to refrain not only from breaking the law, but from acts which, though 
arguably legal, are sufficiently dubious that they strain the already fragile 
bonds of social trust our democracy depends on Failing this, we should at least 
expect them to abide by the same rules as ordinary citizens. Voters throughout 
the country are rightly angered by their elected representatives' apparent 
willingness to regard themselves as exempt from these standards: to pass laws 
to which they are not subject;to claim privileges not available to 
constituents, and to abuse power voters have given them. Above all, voters have 
reason to be on guard against electing representatives who might claim the 
right to exempt themselves from the most basic duty of a citizen: the duty to 
obey the law.*

SMART POLITICS, MEXICAN AMERICAN-STYLE: MOST WILL NOT VOTE ON ELECTION DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard Rodriguez, Richard Rodriguez, an editor at Pacific News Service, is 
author of Days of Obligation (Viking). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A friend of mine, an African American fireman in San Francisco, thinks that 
Mexican Americans are smart because most of us don't bother to vote. On the 
other hand, my Mexican mother frets. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Texas or New Mexico, which have older, more politically active Latino 
populations, California has only lately begun to see Latinos running for school 
boards or city halls. California has yet to see one of its own Mexican American 
politicians assume statewide or national stature. And, even this year, when so 
much of the political debate concerns Mexico and Mexicans, most of us will not 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother thinks that Mexican Americans have made themselves easy prey for 
ambitious politicians. My friend, the black fireman, by contrast, thinks the 
biggest mistake black Americans have made is believing in politics and 
politicians. "We have black mayors, black congressmen -- there are blacks 
everywhere among the political elites -- but what has our belief in politics 
gotten us, except for the assumption that the government would somehow solve 
our problems?" 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, in one of the largest demonstrations ever seen in Los Angeles, 
an estimated 70,000 people marched against Proposition 187 -- the measure that 
would deny government assistance, including medical and educational, to illegal 
immigrants and their children. Organizers of the demonstration were ecstatic at 
the size of the crowd. Here, surely, was the galvanic moment of Mexican 
American political consciousness in California! 
</P>
<P>
 Other Californians were not so sure. They wondered why so many of the 
demonstrators were carrying Mexican flags. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican Americans are notorious in the United States for not cutting their 
apron strings to Mexico. They violate the American habit of amnesia. We remain 
mama's boys, attached to memory, unwilling to abandon our hyphen. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Mexican Americans are quick to take offense. Since when 
does affection for Mexico mean one cannot be a loyal American? Mexican 
Americans proudly name their fathers and grandfathers who have fought in U.S. 
wars. Mexican Americans won more Purple Hearts in the Second World War than any 
other ethnic group. The fact remains: Because of proximity to memory, because 
of the 19th-Century rivalry between the two countries, Mexican Americans have 
had a complicated relationship to Mexico and to America. If today, U.S. 
politicians assume that Mexican Americans are not a threat on Election Day, our 
Mexican grandmothers never let us forget that we speak bad Spanish, they scold 
us for our gringo ways, for not being Mexican enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Latinos constitute nearly 30% of California's population, we number 
fewer than 10% of the state's eligible voters. Many within that 10% will not 
bother to vote. The politicians are counting on it. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is that, this summer, after decades of political indifference, 
Mexicans in huge numbers lined up to vote in their nation's presidential 
election. Eighty percent of Mexico's eligible voters stood for hours, many 
under the unblinking sun, to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, proponents of Proposition 187 have framed their argument in 
terms of welfare dollars. But for many Latinos, the issue of immigration is all 
about jobs. Surely, the most interesting pre-election polls indicate that large 
numbers, perhaps even the majority, of Latinos will vote in favor of 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Should that be so very surprising? For decades in California, there has been a 
competition for jobs between native-born Latinos and newly arrived immigrants. 
The newcomer was willing to work for the lowest wage, the newcomer was always 
trying to find room in the overcrowded barrio, the newcomer posed the greatest 
threat to Latinos only one rung up the ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 I know a Mexican American who works as a border patrolman along the San Ysidro 
corridor. He loathes Mexico. His father fled the corruption of Mexico, its 
politics and its cynicism. Now, the border patrolman is horrified to see Mexico 
approaching, every night approaching, on his green radar screen. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of line, what Mexican kids will tell you is that there are 
two Californias. As workers and consumers, these kids will be welcomed and used 
in Los Angeles. But as outlaws ("illegals"), they will be methodically hunted. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexicans are accustomed to the double standard. For decades, there have been 
two ways in Mexico. There has been the realm of the public, the official -- the 
listed price or written law. In fact, however, official means negotiable, 
capable of being subverted by private transaction, bartering in the 
marketplace, a bribe in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, Mexicans have come to regard official prohibitions as 
just that: official -- an inconvenience to their lives in private America. 
Mexicans thus see right through America's hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
 On the 11 o'clock news, the politician complains about illegal immigrants; in 
his private life, the politician employs an illegal immigrant as a nanny. 
Mexicans are not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 The kid in Tijuana -- tomorrow an "illegal" in California -- says he intends 
no disrespect of U.S. law. But there is a job at a dry cleaners in Glendale. If 
he gets arrested tonight, he will try tomorrow. The determination registers not 
so much defiance of the law as a patience with it, tempered with certainty that 
the law does not describe the way life actually is. 
</P>
<P>
 My African American friend, the fireman in San Francisco, says: "Everywhere 
you look now in California, you can see Mexicans working." (We are sitting in a 
cafe for yuppies where the woman at the expresso machine, the busboy, the 
dishwasher -- everyone but the cafe owner -- is Latino.) If it turns out, as 
expected, that most Latinos in California will not vote this time around, 
perhaps that is only because Latinos have anticipated what many other Americans 
are only coming to realize: Washington is irrelevant to our real lives; 
Sacramento is irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 The womanizing politician preaches to us about family values. Another 
politician who complains about welfare mothers cannot tell us why his own 
children listen to black rap; he promises us more jails as a solution to what 
ails America. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a few political observers have noted how eerie it is this year watching 
the candidates for the U.S. Senate and for the governor's office, listening to 
their debates, watching their handlers, their supporters. None of these people 
look like California is beginning to look -- the United Colors of Benneton -- 
on the streets and freeways. California's political life is in danger of 
becoming a white masque. 
</P>
<P>
 My Mexican mother is furious at the politicians. She is frustrated that many 
Mexican Americans will not bother to cast an answering ballot. And the 
politicians will take advantage of Mexican apathy. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother is right. But it is also apparent this year, as never before, that 
when politicians and politics are no longer connected to actual lives, our 
politicians and their coveted power may ultimately be in greatest jeopardy.*

CALIFORNIA MUST REINVENT ITS TIES TO WASHINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Friedman, David Friedman, who directed the New Economy Project, is an 
urban economist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Bill Clinton's visit to California last week to stump for Democratic 
candidates inadvertently highlighted one of the most important, but least 
discussed, economic challenges facing the state: restruc turing its 
dysfunctional relations with Washington. Nothing comes close to the federal 
government as the primary cause of California's recent recession. Yet, rather 
than fundamentally alter the increasingly ill-informed federal tax, regulatory 
and technology policies that are punishing the state's economy, most 
politicians are seduced by the notion that they can improve the state simply by 
getting a bigger piece of the federal pie for their constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a dangerous, if appealing, strategy. Bidding for Beltway baubles 
returns far less to California than the billions of tax dollars it contributes 
to Washington, erodes the fiscal foundations of the state's healthier 
industries and obscures the true sources of its industrial vitality. 
</P>
<P>
 The dimensions of the problem are staggering. Clinton's brief visit served to 
mark the nearly two years during which Washington's adverse effect on 
California's high-wage industries has gone from bad to immeasurably worse. 
Typical was the Administration's 1993 tax plan, which a secret government 
report, released the day after Congress approved the new levies, estimated will 
cost the state $37 billion over the next five years, by far the largest 
increase in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, with growing frequency, Clinton-appointed regulators have tried to 
impose air, water and other resource restrictions that threaten California's 
economy, while the Justice Department supports legal challenges to community 
improvement measures, such as controlling panhandling. The Administration has 
conducted, or plans, punitive tax and labor audits of such growing California 
sectors as textiles and entertainment. Its disproportionate defense cuts -- 
California was stripped of defense jobs at four times the rate of other regions 
-- account for at least 50% of the state's total recessionary job losses in the 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 With such an economic backdrop, pledges to "fight for California" and bring 
home more federal bacon as an antidote to Washington's anti-industrial policies 
seem illusory, if not foolish. Even the most spendthrift federal programs will 
cost California more than their "face" value, because for each new dollar of 
federal spending, Californians contribute an increasingly disproportionate 
share of the underlying tax base. Politicians celebrated the millions of 
dollars they "won" for the state in the recent federal crime bill, for example, 
but were strangely silent about the price. Californians, in fact, will pay $250 
million more than they will receive under the program. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the funds flowing to the state equaled the taxes going to 
Washington -- and, today, California pays billions more to the federal 
government than it receives -- the state's economy would still be shortchanged. 
Pre-tax dollars in the hands of California consumers, which can be spent in any 
way they choose, are worth more in real terms than dollars sent back, 
encumbered by federal mandates and used to buy goods and services from 
Washington bureaucracies. 
</P>
<P>
 When consumers spend their money on what they prefer to buy, workers and 
businesses in California that meet their needs learn to develop the skills and 
products required to compete in global markets. By contrast, no matter how 
well-justified by promises of technology "spin-offs" or magical new industrial 
development, spending by federal bureaucrats, in the vast majority of cases, 
diverts what would otherwise be more productive uses of labor and materials 
into esoteric, non-market areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to what many may believe, for example, sending $1 billion of taxes to 
Washington in exchange for a $1-billion defense contract is a terrible deal for 
California. In such a transaction, the state has to move resources from 
competitive, growing sectors -- engineers who might otherwise be designing 
biomedical instruments, writers who could develop the next box-office smash, or 
electronic components that could be used in novel auto sensors -- to meet 
federal contract demands. It also has to pay for the goods and services used to 
assemble the final products, expenditures that inevitably leak to and benefit 
vendors and workers in other regions. These and other offsetting expenses can 
reduce the real value of federal contracts to just pennies on each dollar the 
taxpayers send to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Such remarkably one-sided exchanges, moreover, strip resources from the 
smaller-scale, growing companies that are actively building California's 
economy, and blind the state's leadership to the needs of the industries that 
will generate their constituents' future prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
 A study of more than 18,000 firms employing 370,000 people in the software, 
environmental, entertainment, mechanical engineering, biomedical and textiles 
areas in Los Angeles County, for example, showed that 96% were privately held 
firms of fewer than 100 employees. The huge majority reported absolutely no 
reliance on federal funding, training, technology or procurement schemes so 
avidly pursued by their congressional representatives. Rather, they grew by 
using family and personal resources to start their firms, reinvested the 
proceeds, and developed new products and technologies in collaboration with 
other self-financed companies in the region. Most expanded throughout the 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Until quite recently, California's leadership had no inkling of their state's 
true vitality. Having lost faith in the private sector, they begged for help 
from federal bureaucracies. But to the embarrassment of the high-profile 
economic "forecasting" outfits and special interests who exploited preliminary, 
wildly inaccurate employment data to help justify federal bailouts, 
California's official recessionary job-loss figures are being lowered to about 
50% below the 870,000 level once repeated as gospel just a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Driven by previously unmeasured gains in non-defense sectors and by privately 
held, smaller firms, the new data show that California came out of its 
recession nearly a year earlier than previously believed, and its job growth 
during that period was five times the rate earlier reported. Major companies 
like BankAmerica are now increasing their estimates of California's job 
expansion by threefold over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 California can thus ill afford the lost opportunities and diverted development 
produced by the economic fantasies contained in pork-barrel politics. Rather 
than continue to play a game that the state can only lose, every candidate 
should be debating proposals for restructuring the federal tax, various 
regulatory regimes and other policies to strengthen California's new economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, few of California's aspiring leaders have exhibited the 
willingness to discuss, let alone accomplish, such changes. Yet, no issue is 
more crucial to the state's economic future. If Californians cannot find 
leaders to effectively represent the interests of their real economy in 
Washington, the state's newly rediscovered burgeoning sectors and growing firms 
could well become the next casualty of misguided federal policies.*

THE NATION; FOLLOWING GREENSPAN, DEMOCRATIC ECONOMISTS ABANDON KEYNESIAN MODEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert A. Levine, Robert A. Levine, an economic consultant, served as deputy 
director of the Congressional Budget Office.

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the fortunes of the Democratic Party have waxed and waned over the decades 
from Franklin D. Roosevelt's Administration to Bill Clinton's, one small but 
crucial group -- liberal Democratic economists -- has stood by the party. In 
recent years, however, while staying with their party, many of these economists 
have departed from their old doctrines. By doing so, they have gravely injured 
both the Clinton Administration and the liberal objectives they still espouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the New Deal, the Democrats have been the party of liberal economics 
aiming for the twin goals of prosperity and fairness. These goals made 
political sense and, as objectives for national policy, they were supported by 
a panoply of economists who advocated government economic stimulus at times of 
underemployment, following theories developed by John Maynard Keynes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, however, many inside-the-Beltway economists brought up in this 
tradition have abandoned it -- just as they took high posts in the first 
Democratic Administration in 12 years. The leaked memorandum from Budget 
Director Alice M. Rivlin to Clinton, suggesting spending cuts or tax increases 
to reduce the deficit is the most recent manifestation of this.  
</P>
<P>
 The desertion cut down the central pillar of the intellectual support on which 
Clinton could have built his New Democracy. The flight from liberal 
Keynesianism, hardly mentioned in current punditry about the vicissitudes of 
the Clinton Administration, is at the core of many other problems. It has made 
powerless the tenet that should be central to modern liberalism -- that 
government has a role to play; and it has helped make powerless the President 
who wanted to promote that principle. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this is a tocsin pealing out for the old faith by proclaiming that the 
President has moved too much toward the political center. Far from it. 
Prosperity and fairness are the issues of most concern to the middle class, and 
the President's problem with the middle is that he has walked away from these 
core interests. He has backed off every position -- his fatal flaw is 
indecisiveness, not leftishness or rightishness. 
</P>
<P>
 The downward spiral began with Clinton's 1993 abandonment of his original 
threefold economic program -- deficit reduction, economic stimulus and 
government investment in the nation's physical and human infrastructure. Facing 
opposition to the last two, Clinton abandoned them and focused on deficit 
reduction. This painted him into a corner that makes it near impossible to 
achieve any programmatic progress in this term -- and so makes unlikely any 
hope of a second. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 story has been cast as the victory of the "deficit hawks," sober 
economists intent on reducing the gap between federal spending and tax 
revenues, over the purely political advocates of spending on the investment 
programs. But the common perception -- that the "hawks" represented the 
responsible economic community, as against the irresponsible politicians -- is 
not true. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost every one of the economists in the Clinton Administration had earlier 
espoused economic policies where stimulus took priority over deficit control. 
Rightly frightened by the mounting deficits of the Reagan-Bush years, however, 
by the 1990s they had abandoned their roots for Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan's "responsible" economics -- where reduction of the deficit and fear 
of inflation were the operative factors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greenspan position was not implausible, but neither was it unshakable. 
Outside the Administration, many liberal economists, including some respectable 
enough to have won Nobel prizes, continued to insist there was still room for 
stimulus in 1993 -- and still need for public investment. These economic 
arguments deserved to be heard by the President -- but they were not made in 
the Administration's councils dominated by the Greenspan "liberals." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan, and the old and new Greenspanians, reason that: Cumulated high 
deficits and national debt mean deficit reduction must take priority over all 
other public objectives. They argue that, as put in Rivlin's memo, we must 
"reduce the deficit to release saving for private investment." They also say 
even moderate inflation is self-accelerating, and therefore any inflation will 
scare business and hamper growth. The goal must be zero inflation, and 
government attempts to stimulate growth by cutting taxes or cutting interest 
rates, will be inflationary and thus self-defeating. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither argument is "wrong," but both are partial. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the deficit pushes out private saving only in a fully employed economy 
-- which we have not had lately. Indeed, much of the time, 
government-stimulated growth will encourage investment by increasing demand for 
the goods to be produced by new private capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, a degree of inflation is built into every developed economy, but the 
"evidence" that mild inflation is bound to accelerate comes mostly from the 
1970s -- when soaring oil prices distorted all the world's economies. In the 
'70s, Presidents Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter had only unpalatable choices 
between combinations of high inflation and high unemployment. Both lost their 
reelection bids. In the 1990s, however, it seems we do have a choice on the 
margin between moderate rates of inflation with satisfactory economic growth 
and relatively low unemployment, and attempts to reduce inflation to zero 
resulting in higher unemployment and slower growth. 
</P>
<P>
 These arguments had been understood and espoused by Clinton's economists in 
their youth. But by 1993, Greenspan was unopposed by these economists, and the 
"hawks" won -- with two results. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the economy grew, but only slowly -- one reason for the small favorable 
political bounce from the growth that has occurred. Greenspanian economists now 
argue the current and historically high unemployment rate, around 6%, is the 
best we can do without "unacceptable" inflation, and Greenspan has made clear 
his intention to use the Fed's control of money and interest rates to keep it 
that way. But at that level, a lot of young middle-class entrants into the job 
market are in trouble and some middle-aged job losers are in even more.  
</P>
<P>
 Second, and perhaps more important, the stringent federal spending limits 
imposed because of the priority given to deficit reduction mean no real fiscal 
room exists for Clinton's programs for long-run prosperity and fairness. These 
were the investment programs intended to repair physical infrastructure, reform 
welfare, restore education, retrain unskilled workers. This lack of capacity in 
turn reinforces Clinton's tendency to talk of his goals with soaring rhetoric 
and then back down because of fiscal and political reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, the caps imposed on future budgets allow no future flexibility. This 
is a pity because the central liberal tenet about government's role has thus 
become meaningless, and the President who tried to espouse it has become 
powerless. Smart liberalism might have avoided it. But empty rhetoric, 
high-unemployment growth and a powerless presidency will do little for 
liberalism -- or Clinton's reelection chances. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rivlin memo is one more milestone on the path downward. To be sure, she 
suggests four other goals in addition to deficit reduction: increased public 
investment; universal health security and reduction of costs; retirement 
security and social security solvency, and middle-class tax cuts. But without 
stronger economic growth, we can't get there from here, and the continued 
stress on deficit reduction will preclude that growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there is no strong voice now advocating economic policies to emphasize 
growth and fairness. Where have all the liberals gone? And where will all the 
Democrats go?*

ECONOMIC CHANGE IS COMING TO CUBA -- BUT HOW RADICAL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Walter Russell Mead, Walter Russell Mead, a contributing editor to Opinion, 
is the author of Mortal Splendor: The American Empire in Transition (Houghton 
Mifflin). He is working on a book about U.S. foreign policy. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Beside the pools of Havana's new hotels, the ice cubes tinkle in exotic 
cocktails; beggars follow foreign tourists in the streets outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-five years after Fidel Cas tro came to power, Cuba is coming out of the 
deep freeze. For now, the changes are small, but like the first faint breezes 
of an approaching hurricane, they are the harbingers of a storm that will 
reshape Cuba's political and social realities and create a major foreign-policy 
crisis for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The big news isn't that the Cuban government has announced some economic 
changes -- reopening the free farmers' markets and moving toward free markets 
in certain other goods. These are baby steps on the road to reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The real news is who is behind these changes -- and why. Well-informed Cubans 
with personal ties to the highest levels of the island's leadership agree: 
Fidel's powerful brother, Raul, is behind these latest reforms and, behind him, 
stand the Cuban armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Badly shaken by the unrest last summer -- the raft exodus and the riots in 
downtown Havana -- and hurt by the economic crisis that has forced a 50% cut in 
military salaries, Raul and the top army brass want to solve the crisis and 
save the system peacefully. Cuba's armed forces are increasingly impatient with 
the blundering political bureaucracy of the civilian government and they dread 
one thing above all: a situation in which the army will be used to suppress 
civil unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The fears are not unrealistic. Cuba's gross domestic product has plunged 45% 
since 1989, and basic foods are in short supply. "Why is Castro like an onion?" 
runs a popular joke in Havana. Answer: "They both make you cry in the kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
 The army's idea is to steer Cuba toward the China model of reform -- 
perestroika without glasnost. A combination of market reforms and enhanced 
political discipline will, the Army hopes, allow the Cuban economy to recover 
its dynamism without threatening the Communist Party and the Castro brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a forlorn hope beyond a few officers and technocrats. Few informed Cubans 
think this can succeed. The U.S. embargo is only part of the reason. As most 
Cuban economists know, the Cuban market isn't big enough, and Cuban producers 
nowhere near competitive enough, for Cuba to take the Chinese road to 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the armed forces move to implement limited reforms, another group of 
Cubans is pushing more radical changes. This group -- based in think tanks, 
certain ministries and in Cuba's small but important group of independent 
non-party, non-governmental organizations -- is still loyal to what they call 
"social goals of the revolutionary process" but their vision of a reformed Cuba 
looks like a West European social democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 This group of reformers -- most too young to remember Castro's revolution -- 
recognizes that Cuba must adjust to the international capitalist economy. But 
in a series of conversations with a half-dozen leading members of this new 
breed of reformers, one message came through: These Cubans don't worry so much 
about whether Cuba has a capitalist future as they do about what kind of 
capitalism Cuba will develop. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Cuba develop a European style of capitalism -- with an extensive social 
safety net and a strong economic role for the government? Many leading Cubans, 
including well-known members of the Communist Party, would be happy to settle 
for this. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Cuba develop a Korean-style capitalism with less individual freedom, and 
fewer social benefits than in the European model, but with rapid economic 
growth? This possibility is less attractive to the more democratically minded 
of Cuban intellectuals, but is acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 What virtually nobody in Cuba wants is a return to the Latin American form of 
capitalism they experienced in the past. Cubans do not want to import the drug 
problems, violence and crime that plague so much of Latin America; nor do they 
want to recreate the immense gulf between rich and poor found in societies like 
Brazil and the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 As they try to imagine a new future for Cuba, the new generation of economists 
and intellectuals is dropping old taboos. Some make the case for a "big bang" 
market reform on the Polish model. Others are working out plans to compensate 
corporations and individuals whose property was confiscated by the Castro 
government. Public discussion of these radical ideas remains limited, but the 
continuing economic crisis forces even conservatives to study alternative 
ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this means that Cuba is about to turn into a Caribbean Sweden. The old 
revolutionaries, and especially the Castro brothers, still control political 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the democratic reformers in their way are as unrealistic as the 
authoritarian reformers in the armed forces. Cubans may not want to go back to 
Latin-style dependent capitalism, but it is hard to see how they can avoid it. 
Cuba is a tropic sugar island with few national resources or opportunities. The 
agricultural products and nickel that Cuba makes are cheap commodities in the 
world economy. The oil and technologies needs are expensive. Though Cuban 
citizens are educated far beyond levels achieved in the rest of Latin America, 
they know little about such vital subjects as business and management. Finally, 
35 years of socialist planning have saddled Cuba with an Eastern European-style 
legacy of useless factories and worthless state enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Cuba's conservatives nor its reformers seem able to admit how grim the 
situation is. Both groups clutch at straws. The conservatives hope this or that 
Band-Aid can preserve the essence of Cuban socialism; reformers look for some 
miraculous escape from the abysmal Cuban economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Every East European economy fell into crisis when it introduced reforms. 
Income fell, unemployment and inflation rose, and social services decayed 
faster during the period of reforms than under the last years of socialism. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuba may not quite go the way of Ukraine -- for one thing, it has already 
suffered the shock of losing its access to cheap Soviet oil. But radical reform 
won't be the end of the Cuban economic crisis. It will merely open a new and 
more difficult phase in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans are tempted to be smug about Cuba's problems. For 35 years, Castro 
thumbed his nose at the Colossus of the North. He openly subverted his 
neighbor, attempting to foster anti-Americanism and communism in a hemisphere 
Washington thinks it owns. It is satisfying to gloat now, and the State 
Department seems to be doing it. As the Cuban crisis deepens, the United States 
is tightening the embargo and stepping up its rhetorical war. 
</P>
<P>
 This is natural -- but unwise. Economic hardship in Cuba will send more boat 
and raft people to Florida; political turmoil will inevitably spill over into 
the inflamed politics of the Cuban exile community. With more than 1 million 
Cubans now living in the United States, America's interest in the peace and 
stability of Cuba is greater than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. policy toward Cuba must change. Instead of working to dismantle the 
existing regime, we need to build links to the post-communist Cuba starting to 
emerge. Full diplomatic relations would allow U.S. diplomats to develop ties to 
Cuban reformers. An end to the travel ban will allow more face-to-face contact 
between U.S. citizens and their Cuban counterparts. A gradual end to the 
embargo will help put a floor under the Cuban economy. 
</P>
<P>
 These measures won't cure Cuba's economic woes or stabilize its politics. 
Nothing can. But they don't cost any money and they will help prevent a descent 
into chaos in an island of 11 million people 90 miles from our shores. Both 
Cuba and the United States need changes in policy, and the longer each country 
waits, the worse things will get.*

THE WORLD; WILL THE PEACE-MINDED ARABS PULL THE PLUG ON HAMAS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Howard R. Teicher, Howard R. Teicher, author of Twin Pillars to Desert 
Storm: America's Flawed Vision in the Middle East from Nixon to Bush (Morrow), 
served on the staff of the National Security Council from 1982-87.

<P>
 It might seem ironic to many Western observers that Israel's recognition of 
the Palestine Liberation Organization, its implementation of the 
Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Principles and its new peace treaty with 
Jordan have emboldened and strengthened Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement. 
But recall that many in the West never understood the antipathy of most 
Egyptians, and much of the Arab world, toward Anwar Sadat's peace diplomacy or 
the rage and hostility, in general, of Islamic militants toward the West. 
Still, with both hope and expectations of what peace can mean growing 
throughout the Middle East, is it not possible that Hamas' influence will 
diminish as Arab governments line up to sign treaties with Israel? 
</P>
<P>
 Well aware of the rising influence of Hamas during the waning years of 
Israel's occupation, PLO Chairman Yassir Arafat tried to co-opt or neutralize 
Hamas by offering its leadership the opportunity to participate in his 
self-governing authority. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin discreetly 
attempted to strengthen Arafat's hand, but was handicapped by his own 
vulnerability to right-wing opposition to any dealings with the Palestinian 
leader. So far, Arafat has neither improved the daily lives of most 
Palestinians nor successfully tempered Hamas' violent opposition to peaceful 
reconciliation with Israel. Hamas, ever conscious of Arafat's dilemma, 
continues to promote armed struggle against Israel but its strategy is not to 
fight the Declaration of Principles; rather, it is to take maximum advantage of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat thus finds himself caught between the Israeli hammer and the Hamas 
anvil. Hamas members slay two Israelis while shooting up a cafe district in 
Jerusalem; kidnaps and murders an Israeli soldier, and orchestrates the 
terrorist bombing of a commuter bus in Tel Aviv, killing 23. In response, 
Israel pushes Arafat to crack down. Arrests are made to appease Israel's 
outrage, but Hamas activists are promptly released by the Palestinian 
Authority. The net result is the strengthening of Hamas at Arafat's expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Against this background, Arafat lamely argues that he can persuade Hamas to 
cooperate with him and eventually come to terms with Israel. Nevertheless, even 
Arafat's own political organization, Al-Fatah, acknowledges that Hamas claims 
the loyalty of at least 25% of the population in the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Of direct consequence to Israeli security and to Israeli confidence in Rabin's 
negotiating skills is the fact that Arafat has not acted to neutralize the 
armed wing of Hamas. By withdrawing from Gaza and turning security chores over 
to the Palestinian police, the Israelis have witnessed a rapid and dramatic 
increase in the amount and type of weaponry now being fielded by Hamas 
terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
 With the ever more sophisticated arming of various Palestinian factions, an 
escalation to which Arafat has acquiesced, Gaza is beginning to resemble Beirut 
before the Lebanese civil war, which began in 1975. In addition to possessing 
automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades, Hamas has reportedly acquired 
anti-tank guided missiles and other short-range high-performance weapon 
systems. Non-Palestinian veterans of the war in Afghanistan are now turning up 
in Gaza. For these zealots, the cause of Hamas may hold even greater importance 
than the liberation of Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its inception during the intifada , Hamas has been affiliated with an 
organization known as Ikhwan al-Muslimin, or the Muslim Brotherhood. Founded in 
Egypt in the 1920s, the Muslim Brotherhood has consistently called for the 
removal of secular regimes and the establishment of Islamic governments. 
Organized along national lines, its chapters have pursued this goal using 
various means and strategies, some peaceful, others violent. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the liberation of Afghanistan by the mujahedeen, Hamas assumed the 
mantle of the vanguard of the Brotherhood. At international conferences, it 
repeatedly affirmed that "the route to Islamic redemption is the liberation of 
Jerusalem and Palestine." The liberation of Jerusalem became the rallying cry 
of Muslim Brotherhood organizations. Thus, the agreement by Israel and Jordan 
to assign responsibility for the preservation of Muslim holy places in 
Jerusalem to Jordan's King Hussein has further inflamed the passions of Islamic 
fundamentalists everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most Muslim governments, with the exceptions of Iran and Sudan, have 
cut back or eliminated their support for Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood is 
increasing its backing. A virulent foe of Arab-Israeli peace, Tehran continues 
to be the boldest supporter of Hamas at the state level. Its budget last year 
included a line titled "Aid to the Palestinian Revolution -- $20 million," an 
amount comparable to 1% of the gross domestic product of the occupied 
territories. With an embassy in Tehran and close ties to the Hezbollah in 
Lebanon, Hamas can count on Iran and its numerous overseas revolutionary groups 
to continue to provide financial, weapons and political support. 
</P>
<P>
 Of even greater consequence, however, is the steady stream of money, materiel, 
human and moral support that Hamas is receiving from its affiliates around the 
world, including organizations in the United States. Muslim Brotherhood 
chapters can be found in nearly every Muslim country, as well as in Germany, 
France, England and other European states. Hamas representatives regularly meet 
with these groups to solicit financial support and volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 It will not be easy to stop the flow of money and arms, even from the United 
States, where it is now a top U.S. priority. But the wide-ranging 
implementation of such difficult measures is vital if peace is to endure and 
expand. 
</P>
<P>
 Important progress has been achieved in the Middle East. But those who desire 
to see a comprehensive peace settlement must prepare for terrorist attacks by 
Hamas and its supporters outside the Middle East as well as inside Israel. 
People of goodwill everywhere -- including Arabs and Israelis -- must cooperate 
as they have never managed to before if the violent zealotry of these militants 
is to be overcome.*

POLITICAL FORECAST; WILL SYRIA SOON MAKE PEACE WITH ISRAEL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Will Syrian President Hafez Assad sign a peace treaty with Israel? The Times 
asked five experts on the Middle East.

</P>
<P>
 The chances of peace with Syria being negotiated and carried out are better 
than they've ever been. There is logic in this piece of the puzzle falling into 
place. Now there is peace with Egypt and Jordan, it rules out the option of an 
all-Arab war, and Assad doesn't want to remain isolated. The only serious 
military threat to Israel is from Syria. If he can end that threat, the 
Arab-Israeli war is essentially over, and the state of Israel is secure.

<P>
 Judith Kipper 
</P>
<P>
 A fellow of the Brookings Institution, member of Middle East Council on 
Foreign Relations. I think President Assad will make peace. He has said he 
would, and he went further in being specific than he ever has in the past. 
(Once peace is achieved), it means normalizing and stabilizing the area so the 
real issues of economic development can be tackled.

<P>
 Richard W. Murphy 
</P>
<P>
 Senior fellow on New York-based Middle East Council on Foreign Relations. I 
think Assad wants peace, and his people want peace. But it will take a long 
time. He wants the sort of affirmation that (Yitzhak) Rabin can't give, meaning 
complete withdrawal (from Golan). The timing is important. Can they put their 
needs in conjunction with the Israeli elections? Rabin will be campaigning this 
time next year. Can they make a deal by then or do they want to risk facing a 
Likud government? The opposition could say he's endangering Israel's security 
by dealing with the PLO and Syria.

 Joseph J. Sisco 
</P>
<P>
 Partner in the Washington consulting firm, Sisco Associates, and former 
undersecretary of state, Nixon Administration. There is no immediate outlook 
that Assad is going to make peace with Israel. The gap on key issues is still 
significant. He continues to insist on total withdrawal from the Golan Heights, 
and Israel insists on a full peace that includes diplomatic relations, open 
borders, economic interaction and actual cooperation. Hard negotiations are 
ahead, and there is absolutely no breakthrough.

Camp David accords. That was the first breakthrough and it challenged the other 
Arab states to follow Egypt's example. Once the Palestine Liberation 
Organization was in, and now Jordan, Syria became the only significant player 
left. Countries on the fringes, like Iran, can afford to take radical positions 
against Israel. But I would not be surprised if it went on for several years.*

THE WORLD; WHY MORE 'NORMAL' TIMES MAY UNDO YELTSIN'S FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steven Merritt Miner, Steven Merritt Miner, a professor of Russian history 
at Ohio University, is a contributor to The Diplomats, edited by Gordon Craig 
and F.L. Loewenheim, to be published by Princeton University. He is also 
working on a book, Selling Stalin, about Soviet wartime propaganda. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Early autumn seems to be a season of discontent for Russian President Boris N. 
Yeltsin. Three years after the failed communist coup, and almost exactly a year 
since the violent confrontation between Yeltsin and the reactionary Soviet-era 
Parliament, the fate of the Russian government is once again under a cloud. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the administration of Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin's prime 
minister, narrowly survived a no-confidence vote in the state Duma. Still, the 
omens are far from favorable to the current government. A recent string of 
ecological, economic and foreign-policy messes ensures that the Duma, which in 
the best of times is hostile to the executive, will continue to subject 
Chernomyrdin and his patron to a withering attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent oil spill in northern Russia could not, therefore, have come at a 
worse time politically. The dimensions of the disaster are staggering: more 
than 2 million barrels of oil, representing both millions of dollars in lost 
revenue and vast ecological damage, have oozed into the delicate Arctic 
ecosystem. As the oil spreads, one early report holds that it has already 
covered an area equal to that of the city of St. Petersburg. Unfortunately, it 
is quite possible that the Russian government has understated the dimensions of 
the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleanup will be difficult. The Russian oil industry, never well-equipped, has 
been run down during the last decade; it simply lacks the tools and skills 
necessary to combat a disaster of such dimensions. Furthermore, the terrain and 
climate inhibit a rapid or comprehensive cleanup. Spilling from several holes 
in a pipeline, hot oil has spread over delicate Arctic permafrost; as it does 
so, it melts and permeates the frozen earth, which will then refreeze, leaving 
the oil locked deep into the ground. It's hard to imagine that containment 
efforts will be able to prevent large amounts of oil from leaking into the 
Pechora river, which flows into the Barents Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The disaster is especially damaging to the government, because it can rightly 
be blamed for reacting too slowly. The breaks in the pipeline occurred some 
months ago; yet, the still-nationalized Russian oil industry tried only 
lackadaisically to contain the spill with a makeshift, and apparently 
inadequate, dam that subsequently burst during rainstorms. Also, 
anti-government politicians will surely contend, misleadingly but perhaps 
effectively, that budget cuts are responsible for equipment failures in the oil 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Ecological disaster in the north, far away from population centers, might be 
forgiven if Russians believed that the economy was getting better; but they do 
not. Recent polls show that almost 90% of Russians feel that the economy is 
calamitous. And yet, the situation is more complex than that grim statistic 
would suggest. In the same poll, some three-quarters of Russians indicated that 
their personal economic situation is not too bad. The government's dilemma is 
that it gets none of the credit for individuals' personal feelings of 
well-being but is blamed for the pervasive sense of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the blame for this widespread alarm about the economy must rest with 
Chernomyrdin, who comes from the old Soviet managerial class and has been 
reluctant to cut subsidies to failing state firms. As a result, the state 
prints ever more worthless rubles, adding to inflation and spawning the 
precipitous drop of the ruble, which fell in value versus a none-too-healthy 
dollar by 47% between Sept. 1 and Oct. 11, falling 22% on that last day alone. 
Although the ruble quickly recovered much of its value, the political damage 
had been done. Chernomyrdin appeared weak, foreign investors were scared and 
the public wondered who was running the ship. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most of the successor states to the old Soviet Union, Russia has 
managed to avoid hyperinflation, and the drive for privatization is at last 
producing results. For the first time since the Bolsheviks created the planned 
economy, more than half of Russia's gross domestic product is now produced by 
the private sector. Military spending has shrunk more dramatically than anyone 
had a right to hope, and unemployment is officially at 6% of the work force. 
But these successes are overshadowed by the roller-coaster ruble and by the 
only partly justified, but widespread, belief that those benefiting most from 
the market economy are organized-crime bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime is the principal civic concern of most Russians, as numerous polls 
attest. The murder rate in Moscow is now not much better than in New York, 
something once almost unthinkable. Muggings are so common, and the perpetrators 
so infrequently caught, that most attacks are not even reported to the police. 
Virtually everyone one talks to believes that crime syndicates control much of 
economic activity, and, although this is not entirely true, it is true enough; 
the resultant despair further undermines the government's programs. 
</P>
<P>
 If Russians feel that the ground is slipping from beneath their feet at home, 
they get little solace from foreign affairs. Most Russians now believe that 
their country has surrendered enough and the time has come to assert Russian 
national interests. The recent withdrawal of Russian troops from Germany, 
though not seriously opposed by any responsible group, added to the general 
sense of Russian humiliation. Even the liberal Nezavisimaia gazetta ran a 
front-page photo of a ragged old Russian woman and her bags being pushed in a 
luggage cart by a smiling German porter under the headline "Russia leaves 
Germany." 
</P>
<P>
 The same paper reported widespread disaffection within the army. Junior 
officers are looking to leave the ranks at the earliest possible time, 
believing that the army has no future. Those between the ranks of major and 
major-general are too old for new careers, they distrust the market economy and 
40% of them support "radical patriotic ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin and his foreign minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, have responded to this 
changing mood by turning Russian foreign policy toward a more nationalist 
course. Thus, the recent attempt to "mediate" between the United States and 
that old Soviet client Saddam Hussein. This also explains the greater 
assertiveness shown by the Russian military in the so-called "near abroad," or 
former republics of the Soviet Union, especially Chechenya, Georgia and 
Tadjikistan. 
</P>
<P>
 Where is Yeltsin in all this? It is now becoming clear that he is a man of 
crisis; the day-to-day drudgery of governing bores him, as he disarmingly 
admits in his autobiographical work "The Struggle for Russia." "In emergency 
situations," he writes, "I'm strong. In ordinary situations, I'm sometimes too 
passive." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is, Russia politics are becoming more "normal," despite the 
current spate of problems. At several critical points in his career, Yeltsin 
has shown himself to be a man of courage, even moral vision; it would be a 
shame if his inattention to vital details should undermine the place he has 
already earned in history.*

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; MIKE HUFFINGTON; THE RACE FOR THE SENATE: A GOP 
NEOPHYTE -- AND PROUD OF IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Proffitt, Steve Proffitt, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a 
producer for Fox News and a contributor to National Public Radio's All Things 
Considered and Morning Edition. He spoke with Mike Huffington during a campaign 
swing through Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Call Mike Huffington a political paradox. The theme of his campaign has been 
"more government isn't the answer." Yet, he has spent about $20 million of his 
personal fortune attempting to win a seat in the world's most elite 
governmental club, the U.S. Senate. He's hired as advisers some of the most 
skillful political insiders in the business -- including Lyn Nofzinger, Edward 
J. Rollins and Kenneth L. Khachigian. Yet, he portrays himself as a 
non-politician and an outsider. In stump speeches, he says private charities 
should take over the government's role in providing for the poor. Yet, since he 
refuses to release his income-tax records, voters have no way of knowing how 
charitable he's been himself. 
</P>
<P>
 But paradox or not, first-term GOP Rep. Mike Huffington has succeeded in 
persuading large numbers of California voters that he's a better choice for the 
Senate than incumbent Dianne Feinstein. Huffington, 47, appears to be running 
neck-and-neck with Feinstein in what -- at $27 million and counting -- is 
already the most expensive Senate race in history. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's father is of one of the richest men in America. Texas oilman Roy 
Huffington discovered and mined rich oil reserves in Indonesia. His son, a 
Harvard Business School graduate, worked in the family business, and, in 1991, 
after moving to Santa Barbara, spent more than $5 million to defeat veteran GOP 
Rep. Bob Lagomarsino in the primary and win a seat in Congress. Just eight 
months after being sworn in, Huffington announced his bid for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Once considered a political lightweight by both Republicans and Democrats, 
Huffington's steady barrage of political ads has raised negative opinions of 
his opponent Feinstein and attracted voters who are angry at government and 
career politicians. He defends his meager record as a congressman -- three 
bills, one resolution and eight minutes speaking on the floor -- by saying the 
last thing the country needs is more legislation. And he bristles at attacks on 
his wife, Arianna, an author and cable TV talk-show host. Former Huffington 
staffers claim she is the brains behind the campaign, and her association with 
a New Age religious sect has been widely reported. While the congressman has 
been an ardent supporter of immigration control, late last week The Times 
reported that the Huffingtons had employed an illegal immigrant as a nanny. 
</P>
<P>
 Some believe it's telling that where Huffington is best known, he is least 
liked. He failed to carry his Santa Barbara district in the primary election, 
and a large group of prominent Santa Barbara Republicans have been raising 
money for his opponent. Feinstein calls him, "A Texas millionaire that can't be 
trusted." But he's betting there's enough disaffection and disgust among 
California voters to put him over the top, and into the Senate. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Question: What do you see as the limits on the role of the federal government? 
 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Government can't teach kids values. It can't be in the house, or the 
workplace, or in everyone's car to protect people from criminals. My feeling is 
that the federal government cannot teach our kids to read and write. Most of 
the social problems we have today -- drugs, alcohol abuse, teen-age pregnancy, 
welfare -- if we want to solve those problems, it gets back to the families of 
those kids spending time with the children while they're young. Reading with 
them at night, making sure they do their homework, teaching them virtues like 
hard work, courage, compassion, responsibility and faith. That part is really 
up to the family, not to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 We're just spending billions and billions of dollars that is going to waste. 
It's not helping the taxpayers, and it's not helping the recipients, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you feel the federal government has any responsibility for things like 
education or helping the poor?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I would like to see the federal welfare system dismantled, and the funding 
that has gone into it be split into two parts -- for deficit reduction and for 
block grants to the states. Those grants would allow the states to experiment 
with different programs to see what works, and have the states be responsible 
for welfare, with no strings attached from the federal government. Washington, 
D.C., puts a straitjacket on our 50 states and all of our cities and local 
communities. And, frankly, the best way you can help an individual is you, 
yourself, helping somebody in your own family, or a neighbor or someone else -- 
we're getting away from the volunteer spirit by saying, "Uncle Sam's gonna 
solve all your problems, just give us your tax money and we'll do it for you." 
It hasn't worked. We've spent $5 trillion and just haven't been able to make a 
dent in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Let's talk about immigration. What should the federal government be doing 
to control the borders?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The federal government has done a lousy job at securing our borders and it 
would be an easy thing to solve if the government would fund the money. It's 
very simple: We just need to put more border guards out there, more lights and 
stop the problem at the border -- so one doesn't have to worry about it after 
people have crossed the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But as you're no doubt aware, here in California, as well as in your native 
state of Texas, immigrant workers -- for the large part, illegal immigrant 
workers -- make up the great majority of the agricultural work force. If we 
succeed in closing off the border, who will harvest the crops?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The first thing you want to do is give the opportunity to harvest those 
crops to citizens -- or people who are here legally. If, in fact, they're 
aren't enough people to do the job, we need to return to something that was 
effective before, and that's called the bracero program, or something similar 
to it, where people can come across the border to work -- you know who they 
are, they pay their taxes and at the end of their work period, they return to 
their home country. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But doesn't history show us that these guest-worker programs contributed to 
illegal immigration -- that the workers did not go home?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm not old enough to know. But I know that the bracero program was a heck 
of a lot better than what we have today, where people just come across the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why did you decide to support Proposition 187 -- which will deny social 
services to undocumented immigrants -- and do you believe it will have a 
dramatic effect on reducing illegal immigration?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I decided to vote for it because illegal immigrants are breaking the law by 
coming across the border, and the law must be upheld. We also need to send a 
message to Washington, D.C., that the people of California are fed up with 
paying $3 billion a year in services to illegal immigrants that are mandated on 
us by Washington. If it passes, which I think it will, it will send a message 
to the Clinton Administration that the time has come for the federal government 
to pick up its responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But what would you say to someone who said that it's a cruel society that 
punishes the children of immigrants by denying them neo-natal care, or 
education or other vital services?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The obligation to provide children with education and so forth is that of 
the home country. It's clear that those countries are shirking their duty. But 
there's no reason that this country should have an open border to 5 billion 
people around the world who might want to come here. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Let's shift gears a bit. Who are your mentors, or your political heroes?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The good news is, no politician is necessarily my political hero. 
Certainly, I don't have any mentors in politics, because I went into it right 
out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are there no figures from history who have inspired you -- Jefferson 
perhaps?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, there's one -- even though I don't consider him a politician, 
although he was in politics for 16 years -- and that's Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't know Jefferson. Do I admire Thomas Jefferson? Certainly, I do. But I 
did not know him, and what I've read in newspapers about my own race -- it 
shows that you can't believe much about what you read. So I have no idea about 
what kind of man Jefferson was, but what I think I know about him, I admire 
tremendously. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: hy did you choose to base your political career in California rather than 
in your native Texas?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, I didn't. I chose to move to California because I wanted to be in the 
film business. And, secondly, I met my wife-to-be in 1985, and she was living 
in Los Angeles. This is where she wanted to live her life, so we decided to 
live here. It wasn't until afterwards that I decided to get involved in public 
office, and it was because the timing was good -- we had seven new, open 
congressional seats because of redistricting in 1991. So I decided to run. 
California is my home. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: One of the major concerns among undecided voters about your candidacy is 
your lack of a political record. What do you say to those people?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think it's a great strength not to be part of the old-boy network of the 
career politicians, who are responsible for the failure of the American 
political system. It's clear that we want people who do not have a 
political-track record, but a business-track record, or something from another 
area, so that we can get fresh blood and new ideas into the government. There 
are always risks. But after the voters of California have me in office for a 
while, they'll know whether or not they've made a good decision, and I think 
they will find that I'm very different from these career politicians like 
Feinstein and (Sen. Barbara) Boxer. So I consider it a great strength not to 
have a political-track record. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So what do you consider to be your qualifications for this office?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm a fiscal conservative. I was very tight-fisted as a businessman. We 
need some people in government who treat taxpayer's money as if it were their 
own, and don't go out and spend it on things that are inefficient and 
ineffective. So I plan to spend a fair amount of my time on the financial side 
of government trying to balance the budget, and hopefully, by the time I finish 
my political career, we'll have enough votes to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: As long as we're talking about spending -- you've been accused of trying to 
buy this Senate seat. How do you explain spending so much of your personal 
wealth on this campaign?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Remember, Mrs. Feinstein has spent $40 million, mostly of other people's 
money, and a few million of her own, over the last four years. About $6 or $7 
million comes from political-action committees. These people who give her money 
want something in return. The benefit of spending your own money is that you're 
not beholden to the special interests; you're only beholden to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 If you look at past elections in the state of California, you've had people 
run for office, like (former Democratic Rep.) Mel Levine, who outspent his 
opponent, Barbara Boxer, by 2-to-1, and he came in third. My point is, you can 
only win if you have a good message -- but you have to get that message out to 
the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So why are you willing to spend a large amount of your considerable 
fortune, and put yourself and your family on the line to win this election? Why 
does Mike Huffington want to be a senator?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I have some young children, and this country is not the country that I grew 
up with. We have major problems with drugs, crime, poor schools, a lack of 
values. There's a bleak future for many of our youth. I figure that if someone 
has been successful in life, if that person is not willing to give something 
back to the country, who's going to? 
</P>
<P>
 In the final analysis, we are all here to help others. And whether we do it 
through being doctors or teachers or through another avenue, it's a blessing to 
be alive, and I want to be able to help other people. This is the way I think I 
can help them the best. Not by staying in business, not by retiring and living 
the good life. But by being an active participant in the political process. To 
return the power that has gone to the federal government back to the people in 
the local communities. 
</P>
<P>
 I see this as a turning-point election. There will be a sea-change if people 
like myself and (Massachusetts Republican Senate candidate) Mitt Romney get 
elected to the United States Senate. We're a new breed of politicians, because 
we are citizen-politicians. We don't want to stay there forever, but to go 
there to change things, and then return home to the state from where we were 
elected.

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; DIANNE FEINSTEIN; THE RACE FOR THE SENATE: 
EXPERIENCED POLITICAN -- BUT DOES IT HELP? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Proffitt, Steve Proffitt, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a 
producer for Fox News and a contributor to National Public Radio's All Things 
Considered and Morning Edition. He spoke with Dianne Feinstein during a 
campaign swing through Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "All my life I've tried to make government work," says Senator Dianne 
Feinstein. In her first two years in the U.S. Senate she's done what many 
consider a remarkable job. She landed positions on two powerful committees -- 
judiciary and appropriations. That helped her get measures passed that brought 
the state money for earthquake assistance, education, prisons and agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a state -- and a nation -- angry at politicians and at government, such 
achievements may work against her in her battle for reelection. Feinstein, 61, 
first came to national prominence in 1977, when San Francisco Mayor George 
Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk were assassinated. Feinstein, then a city 
supervisor, announced the deaths in a dramatic press conference, and was soon 
appointed mayor. She lost a governor's race to Pete Wilson in 1990, but then 
won the right to serve out the final two years of his vacated U.S. Senate seat 
in 1992, defeating Wilson-appointee John Seymour. 
</P>
<P>
 Now she faces one-term Republican Rep. Mike Huffington in her reelection bid. 
The campaign has been expensive and nasty. In March, Feinstein seemed a sure 
bet to return to the Senate -- polls showed her leading the little-known 
Huffington by as much as 30 points. Today that lead has been whittled down to 
single digits by an extensive, expensive and negative Huffington advertising 
campaign. The challenger has painted Feinstein as a "tax-and-spend Democrat," a 
professional politician, a Clinton-clone and pawn to special interests. 
Recently his ads have charged she voted for federal programs that enriched a 
company controlled by her wealthy investor husband, Richard Blum. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein has fired back with vigor. Her ads portray Huffington as a spoiled 
rich kid with no political record who is trying to buy a Senate seat. They've 
lambasted him for refusing to make public his personal income tax records. And 
they've portrayed him as a modern-day carpetbagger, who maintained a legal 
address in Texas until just before running for Congress in order to avoid 
California state income taxes. Due to the angry nature of modern political 
campaigning and the foul mood of voters, Feinstein's ads have only rarely 
pointed out her legislative successes.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, while Huffington is attracting a good number of so-called Reagan 
Democrats, Feinstein counts among her supporters a number of prominent 
Republicans. In spite of her slim lead, Feinstein recently came out in 
opposition to the popular Proposition 187, which would deny social services to 
undocumented immigrants. She now faces an almost certain last minute blitzkrieg 
of Huffington advertising, and dwindling campaign coffers from which to 
respond. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What are your legislative priorities if you're reelected to the 
Senate?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: My legislative agenda continues to be violence, illegal immigration 
and welfare reform. In the area of violence, my job will be to see that 
California gets its fair share out of the crime bill. I've submitted a bill to 
the Senate called the Illegal Immigration Control Act. It would stop illegal 
immigration at the border by giving Border Patrol the tools they need to do the 
job. It would also remove any cash welfare benefits, like Medi-Cal, from people 
here illegally. It would double the penalties for document fraud, and for 
illegal alien smuggling. I would fund these increased efforts with a border 
crossing fee of $1.00, which would provide more than $400 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If these measures were successful, and we did severely limit the amount of 
undocumented immigrants, the largest impact would be on agriculture. What do 
you say to the growers who depend primarily on undocumented workers to harvest 
their crops?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We've got over a million people unemployed in the state, and my own 
recommendation to the growers is that they really make an effort to recruit 
people in cities who are legal and willing to do this kind of work. I think 
they may find surprising numbers of people who want to work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why did you decide to come out against Proposition 187, and was it a tough 
decision to make?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, it was, because a lot of people were encouraging me to support it. We 
spent a lot of time studying it. My conclusion is that it probably violates 
both the state and federal constitutions. It violates federal law, and as such 
would put the state at risk of losing about $15 billion in federal money. Now I 
don't believe we want to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 But more fundamentally, I don't believe we want our teachers, or doctors to be 
INS agents. As I read the initiative, every teacher, if they suspected a 
student was here illegally, would have to report that student. Now think about 
how you do this. You do it by accent, by skin color. And I do not believe that 
this is what our teachers should be doing with their time. I think whatever 
time they have should be focused on teaching. I also believe that school is a 
very good thing for kids and if you take kids out of school, they then become 
fodder for gangs, for drug activity, for other problems, because most of these 
kids are very poor. 
</P>
<P>
 I also believe strongly that everyone should be immunized and inoculated. I 
stood in a clinic in Fresno where 26 children died from the measles, a disease 
that we thought had been eradicated. Polio is making its way back, and other 
communicable diseases are returning. It serves us all to make sure that all 
children are immunized. So I think the way to stop illegal immigration is at 
the borders, not through our children. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How significant is it that your opponent, Mike Huffington, employed an 
undocumented worker as a nanny?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think it's significant on two levels. One, I think it shows what a very 
complicated problem this is. Secondly, it rather speaks for itself. He's 
endorsed Proposition 187, and clearly wants to take the most stringent of 
measures (against illegal immigration) -- but has himself employed someone who 
is here illegally for a substantial period of time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Let's talk about some charges he's made. The first is that your support of 
the Clinton economic package will mean $37 billion in new taxes for California. 
 
</P>
<P>
 A: That package has succeeded in slowing the growth of the deficit, and it's 
reduced the size of government. But let me address the tax issue. There are 13 
million personal income taxpayers in California. Only about 170,000 had their 
taxes go up -- 2.1 million had their taxes go down, and the rest had no change 
in their taxes at all. So, the bottom line is that the very highest income 
earners -- less than 1% of Californians, and mostly those who earn more than 
$250,000 a year -- were the only ones that had their income tax go up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The other charge, which is being trumpeted in full-page ads, is that your 
husband benefited from legislation which you voted in favor of. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, that's nonsense, because he's actually lost money in that company. 
What I voted for was the Health and Human Services appropriations bill, which 
includes funds for student loan programs. Almost half of all (college) students 
need loans. Now, my opponent may not know that, but that's the case in life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you find it ironic that all of your political accomplishments are being 
used against you -- that suddenly all your experience is not a plus, but a 
minus?  
</P>
<P>
 A: As a mayor and supervisor in a difficult city (San Francisco) I learned the 
skills that have enabled me to perform for the people. And I have probably done 
as much as anyone in the history of this country who's ever gone to the United 
States Senate and served just two years. And it is ironic, because I believe I 
have earned a vote for a six-year term. My opponent went to the House at the 
same time I went to the Senate, and he hasn't earned it, because he hasn't done 
anything. And not only that, what he has done, in lie after lie, is to distort 
who I am -- my record, my family. And he's done it with the view that he can 
buy a United States Senate seat, and I don't think a Senate seat should be 
bought. It ought to be earned. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What would you say then to a voter who might accuse you of being part of 
the problem, who might say, "It's professional politicians like you who've 
gotten us into this mess?"  
</P>
<P>
 A: First of all, nothing is going to stop in Washington, whomever is elected. 
There will be authorization bills, and appropriation bills, because that's the 
way the Senate works. What is important is that the Senate works for 
California. And it hasn't been working for California. No Californian had been 
on the Senate Appropriations Committee for 25 years until I got there. And I 
have been able to see that California gets its fair share. We have all these 
other smaller states, whose senators have seniority, and they protect their 
states. I went up there, I worked for California, and I succeeded -- in 
appropriations, with the crime bill, the Desert Protection Act, with economic 
programs. I've done this in two years. Now what I'm saying to people is give me 
six years, and watch me work for you. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Huffington talks a lot about the fact that we don't need more legislation 
-- that government is too big. What do you see as the limits of the federal 
government?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I agree that the government is too big. I voted to cut the federal work 
force by 272,000 people. He did not. I cut my own budget by about 38% over two 
years and saved $2.8 million. Now who's been for smaller government? It's 
rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Let me ask you about the foul mood that voters seem to be stuck in. How do 
you account for this anger toward government and politicians?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, if everything Huffington said about me were correct -- even I 
wouldn't vote for me. But it isn't. No one in the history of this country has 
ever spent what Michael Huffington is spending to buy a United States Senate 
seat. We will be outspent by $20 million. And all of that money is being used 
to call me names -- terrible names. 
</P>
<P>
 When I came out against Proposition 187 he said, "She's finally shown her real 
colors -- they're yellow." He's called me a tax dodger, because, when my 
(former) husband was dying, for two years I didn't have taxes due, so I didn't 
pay taxes. And yet he has stiffed the state, maintained a sham residence in 
Texas to avoid 1990 California taxes on the sale of his business, and he won't 
reveal his personal income taxes as I have. 
</P>
<P>
 This constant barrage fuels people's cynicism. I think there were people who 
thought good of me until they heard these things. And I can't go up against 
him, ad for ad, and match it. It's very hard to correct the record, once these 
things are said. And people don't know who he is. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But do you feel there's something inherently wrong with a person using 
their wealth to finance a campaign?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes I do. I believe there ought to be limits, and I voted for campaign 
spending reform. Interestingly enough, he did not. But the bottom line is, if 
Michael Huffington weren't willing to spend $30 million, this race wouldn't be 
a contest. He doesn't have the political base to raise money. And he's fueling 
this race with his own money, and yet he won't tell anybody where it came from, 
by making his taxes public. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you have days when you feel like this business of politics -- 
particularly the campaigning -- has become so mean and so base that it may not 
all be worth it?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Many days. When I see my family brought into this, and when I see myself 
called "the special interest candidate." I mean, that's just baloney. It's very 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think the kind of negativity that's characterized so many races, 
including your own, is going to increase -- what's going to happen?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm hopeful that once this election is over -- it's certainly the worst one 
of my life -- that I can go back to work, keep my commitments to people, and 
work to make this a better state. You know, I've spent my life in California. 
I've been in every county in this state. And I really deeply feel that I've got 
to continue to do this. I'm good at it, I'm effective, I can work on both sides 
of the aisle and get legislation passed.

 Q: If Huffington wins, along with a few other Republican Senate candidates, 
the GOP could end up controlling the Senate. What would that mean for the 
Clinton Administration -- and for California?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It means all the committee chairs change. You would have Jesse Helms as 
head of foreign relations and Bob Packwood as head of finance. The power in the 
Senate would be in very different hands, and that would mean no campaign 
spending reform, no lobby disclosure reform and probably no extension of the 
Safe Drinking Water Act. 
</P>
<P>
 But I don't believe Michael Huffington will win. I think the people of 
California have sense, and I think they know who cares about them, and their 
families, and their state. And I think they'll conclude it's not Michael 
Huffington, it's Dianne Feinstein.*

 Re "The Angry Majority," Opinion, Oct. 16: 
</P>
<P>
 I agree that it's time to have a "bloodless revolution" to change the 
Establishment in Washington (I don't believe in destroying it) by abolishing 
the electoral voting system but keeping the popular voting system. Electoral 
votes are what make the career politicians think we owe to them, instead of the 
other way around. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted that the electoral voting was feasible when our country was very 
young. But, now we've come of age and have grown more sophisticated in many, 
many ways, electoral vote now is an antiquated but serious hindrance to a 
well-balanced equality. The popular vote, though not necessarily a Band-Aid or 
a cure-all in itself, would make a good catalytic recipe of higher 
accountability for all elected officials.

 * Kevin Phillips makes the observation that many are discontent with 
Washington and want something new. As Phillips notes, people complain about 
both Washington's unresponsiveness and the "special interests." However, many, 
including Phillips, are sending Washington mixed and contradictory messages: 
Whenever President Clinton has taken what the people desired into account, he 
is accused of just following the "polls." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, while we may look back to the days when the population of Washington 
was transient, those days were caused by the use of civil service jobs as 
political bait. The current "special interest" system is far more democratic. 
Yes, Washington needs reform, but the only way we can do this is to remember 
that this is a republic, and we must send clear messages though our votes 
showing that we like true leaders and not demagogues who pander to our desire 
for a lone savior who will clean up some mess such as that in our nation's 
capital.

 * We find ourselves in another political season. The rhetoric is hot and 
furious. There is not a great deal heard regarding candidates' stands on the 
issues; rather (as per usual) a great deal of "negative campaigning." Don't get 
me wrong. I do not take such a dim view of these attack ads as many people do. 
The ads exist for a reason. They generally work. What this doesn't do is say a 
lot for the people who are targeted to consume them. You and I. If they didn't 
generally work, they wouldn't be used. 
</P>
<P>
 I prefer the issues. There are a couple of major reasons why the issues are 
not discussed and stressed more. First, a good many of us simply don't 
understand them. Understanding them takes a bit of time and reading and very 
few invest in those areas. Unfortunately, a democratic society doesn't function 
well in the absence of an informed electorate. How well is our society 
functioning at the moment? I hear a lot of people complaining. Second, the 
principle of political correctness makes frank, open discussion very difficult. 
A candidate might say something sincerely that could possibly offend someone 
and cost a bloc of votes. Can't have that. Better to take a middle road and 
keep the discussion generic and middle of the road. Who is responsible for this 
situation? The candidates are, you are and I am. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was ushered in in 1992 to give us a breath of fresh air after the Bush 
debacle. The Democrats had the answers. They haven't fixed it. The perception 
now is that the Republicans have the answers. Ask Newt Gingrich. Both of these 
groups of politicians are more interested in the power than in the answers. So 
far, we are their willing dupes.

HOWARD LAPPIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In your Oct. 23 article "Rethinking Schools: Scenes From the Front Line of 
Education Reform in L.A.," you described how Principal Howard Lappin turned the 
Foshay Middle School in South-Central into a case study on how educators can 
bring the best of public education to the worst of schools. 
</P>
<P>
 I personally experienced Lappin's influence 20 years ago when I was a student 
at Van Nuys High School.Lappin was my history teacher. He asked me, "Have you 
ever thought about college?" and pushed me to take college preparatory courses. 
When I went to the counselor's office to request a change in my classes, I was 
told that I did not need these courses to graduate. "Why make life hard on 
yourself?" 
</P>
<P>
 When I told Lappin of the response of the counselor, he became visibly angry. 
He marched down with me to the counselor's office and saw to it that I was 
registered in the appropriate courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Lappin expects and encourages each student to reach his/her fullest potential. 
As he stated in your article, "The overt form of classism and racism is when we 
say to a student, you can't learn. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 I went on to graduate from college and also from law school. I do not know if 
this would have happened without Lappin's intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 I am a Mexican immigrant from a lower-middle-class background. If Proposition 
187 had been law when I was in high school, Lappin and other teachers would 
have been legally obligated to report students such as myself to the INS.  
</P>
<P>
 If Californians would focus on improving our state in areas such as education 
reform, as Lappin is doing, instead of wasting energy on an initiative that 
would throw innocent children out of school, our society would be greatly 
improved.

GERMAN ELECTION RESULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your news analysis of the German election ("Kohl's Real Challenge Comes After 
Election Win," Oct. 18) has completely ignored the most important news of the 
event, namely that the right-wing Republican Party is now down to a mere 1.9% 
of the national popular vote. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the time and space you have spent over the years, warning and 
predicting that the danger of a repeat of 1933 should be taken seriously, 
because of the comparatively few racial incidents recently, the fact of the 
decline of the right in elections should not have been missed. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual swing has been to the center-left and more socialism.

 Re a letter from Metrolink passenger Bob Minty of Capistrano Beach, Oct. 17: 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 29 Minty showed an October monthly pass to a Metrolink conductor to 
ride the train. A citation was issued because commuters are required to have 
the correct month's pass, not, as Minty's letter stated, because he had a youth 
pass. Upon receiving proof from Minty that he did own a September pass (but 
accidentally left it at his home), I had his ticket dismissed within 48 hours.

TOM CONNOLLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Incumbent Spotlights His Spotted Past" (Oct. 16), on Assemblyman Tom Connolly 
(D-Lemon Grove), unfortunately made no reference to the dedication and 
accomplishments Connolly has shown as a legislator. 
</P>
<P>
 The lives of over 2 1/2 million veterans in California have been enhanced by 
his role as chairman of the subcommittee on veterans affairs.Of the 20 pieces 
of legislation tracked by the American Legion, Department of California, over 
half were either authored or co-authored by Connolly. His efforts were 
appreciated to the extent that at the Legion's annual convention last June, 
Connolly was bestowed with the honor of "Legislator of the Year, 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 It is truly unfortunate that world turmoil will always necessitate the 
readiness of our armed forces, requiring men and women to disrupt their lives 
for extended periods of time. We are fortunate, therefore, to have dedicated 
legislators like Connolly who will protect the rights of those who give so much 
of themselves in these necessary wars.

LAFFER AND FOX ON TAX REVOLT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To quote an ex-President, "There you go again." 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur (Voodoo Economics) Laffer is back with more sage advice for us 
("California Is Ripe for Revolt Again," with Joel Fox, Column Right, Oct. 21). 
I am sure that you will remember Laffer's economic plan for the Reagan and Bush 
administrations. It was, in a nutshell, to max out on the credit cards and let 
the kids pay the bills after we die. Now Laffer accuses us of "sloppy thinking" 
and points out that "the candidate who first calls for a serious 
across-the-board tax cut would very likely (win)." 
</P>
<P>
 We would be well advised to recall that Laffer's advice on a national level 
was a disaster. Perhaps we should pay heed to the ancient Chinese proverb, 
"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me." 
</P>
<P>
 FREDERIC W. GRANNIS JR. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcadia 
</P>
<P>
 * Laffer and Fox attribute all of California's economic success during the 
1980s to the Proposition 13 tax cuts, and all of its malaise during the 1990s 
to state tax increases in 1990 and 1991. In so doing, they have blithely 
violated the ceteris paribus (other things constant) condition cited in chapter 
one of every introductory economics text as one of the pitfalls to avoid in 
economic thinking.  
</P>
<P>
 In the interest of academic rigor, Laffer might have at least mentioned the 
possibility that our prosperity and increased tax revenue in the '90s were the 
result of booming employment resulting from the large Reagan increases in 
defense spending, and their subsequent decline the result of high unemployment 
caused by defense cutbacks. Citing the aforementioned list of pitfalls in 
economic thinking, "Association is not causation." While the changes in our 
economic fortunes were associated with the changes in state taxes, it does not 
follow that they were caused by them.  
</P>
<P>
 Laffer's prescribed federal income tax cuts in the '80s were followed by the 
largest federal deficits in history, but he would probably be quick to lay the 
blame on the Fed's tight money policies which caused double-digit unemployment 
(the unemployed don't pay taxes). Most economists would concede that it is 
unfair to blame the record deficits of the '80s solely on the supply-side tax 
cuts. Similarly, it is disingenuous of Laffer to claim that changes in tax 
revenues in California were solely the result in changes in tax rates.

PETE WILSON FOR GOVERNOR: ON BALANCE THE BEST CHOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In deciding to endorse in a California gubernatorial election for the first 
time since 1970, this newspaper realized that any evaluation of Pete Wilson has 
to be tempered by a fair respect for the turbulent and depressing economic 
environment in which he has had to govern. 
</P>
<P>
 This must be said at the outset in evaluating his mixed record because at 
times it seems there are two Pete Wilsons. The first is the moderate, 
forward-thinking, pro-environment, straight-talking, policy-wonk Republican who 
defies his own party on issues such as abortion and offshore oil drilling and 
who can cut crafty, pragmatic deals with -- and more than hold his own against 
-- equally crafty Democrats like Assembly Speaker Willie Brown. This is the 
Pete Wilson whom even Sacramento Democrats heartily welcomed after the 
confrontational years of George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the Pete Wilson who signed the overly broad "three-strikes" bill, 
which even veteran prosecutors say the state can't afford; who played games 
with revenue figures to paper-balance the state budget; who grandstands on the 
volatile illegal immigration issue, even advocating the odious Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, any evaluation of the Democratic gubernatorial challenger must ask 
whether there are sometimes two Kathleen Browns. One is the intelligent, 
politically savvy and energetic former Los Angeles school board member and 
current state treasurer -- a pragmatic New Democrat. But then there is the 
Kathleen Brown who ducks hard questions and who makes you wonder if she really 
has an inner core of hard-held convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters have the ability to assess whether Wilson has what it takes to continue 
as governor of the most populous state because they have seen him in action 
over 3 1/2 years. For all his lack of rhetorical pizazz, Wilson is a firm, 
hands-on administrator who keeps his staff jumping and his political opponents 
guessing. He is a knowledgeable student of public policy, especially 
well-versed on such issues as preventive care, children's services and welfare 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also one tough, cool customer. He deserves credit for the bone-wearying 
work of hacking out a compromise budget with a Democratic Legislature amid 
ever-shrinking revenues, while taking on the state bureaucracy and streamlining 
government to make it less of an obstacle course for business and economic 
development. This is the Wilson we like: the competent leader and the moderate 
Republican with core convictions but not obstructionist ideology. 
</P>
<P>
 His accomplishments include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fighting the entitlements monster: A good deal of his welfare reform gets 
to the heart of this fiscally corrosive issue and is a model for the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fighting for California: Amid horrific federal defense cutbacks, he led 
efforts to prepare for future, peacetime uses of military bases. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fighting for economic development: Workers' compensation reform and the 
highly visible efforts to keep businesses from leaving the state set the right, 
urgent tone. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fighting for environmental balance: He laid the groundwork in creating a 
model for habitat preservation that preserves endangered species without 
endangering economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fighting for a saner, safer California: Signing workplace and state office 
smoking bans; signing a bill protecting gays and lesbians against workplace 
discrimination (after unwisely vetoing a similar bill a year earlier); creating 
an important state commission on domestic violence two years ago; signing 
various gun control measures. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the case against Pete Wilson? The governor is clearly not responsible 
for the worldwide recession; indeed, the best argument against him is his 
ambiguous identity -- whether in fact he might not be the politician who 
embraces Proposition 187 because of political expediency and who vetoes a gay 
rights bill because of his braying right wing. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus voters who believe the worst about Wilson will want to give Brown a 
longer look. However lackluster and unfocused her campaign, there is no doubt 
that the state treasurer would bring a buoyant energy to Sacramento, not to 
mention a valuable diversity in making appointments. There's also no question 
that her campaign-book economic plan, though incomplete and raising many more 
questions than it answers, focuses on the urgent need for a long-term fiscal 
blueprint for the state. That's something a second-term Wilson Administration 
would be wise to work harder on. 
</P>
<P>
 However, on balance it must be said that the Brown critique of Wilson fails to 
persuade. She sounds at times like Pete Wilson before the recession, but it is 
he who has brought us through it as governor. Now that we know the ride was 
rough, she asks California voters to throw him out. Things could be a lot worse 
for California. By the arrival of this election season, even the hard-headed 
realists assessing the business outlook at UCLA were seeing light at the end of 
the tunnel. Wilson deserves credit for helping to shepherd this state through 
some very tough times -- recession, fires, riots, earthquakes. Moreover, while 
he is utterly, totally, hopelessly wrong on Proposition 187, he has managed 
successfully to draw attention on the national stage to the plight of states 
trying to come to terms with problems that ought to be federal 
responsibilities. All things considered, Pete Wilson is a leader who deserves a 
second term as governor. And it is on this basis that The Times, with all 
considerable respect for Treasurer Kathleen Brown, endorses his reelection.

THE ERROR OF PROP. 187; BEWARE OF THE QUICK FIX AND THE EMOTIVE SELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States is admired around the world for innovative and responsive 
government. Quick response indeed is often good, but wise governmental social 
policy is another matter. Wise policy is not made speedily, and certainly not 
in a heated election campaign. Good social policy incubates over time, cooks 
along with bipartisan support and is eventually embraced by almost all affected 
groups as necessary and fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, an unresponsive political structure ducks a problem, allows 
tensions to build and suddenly finds itself squeezed into action by pent-up 
voter resentment. When that happens, it lurches forward in a panicky direction. 
This is exactly what has happened with Proposition 187 -- the initiative on the 
Nov. 8 ballot that seeks to drive illegal immigrants away by denying them, and 
their children, education and social services. 
</P>
<P>
 1. AREN'T DRASTIC MEASURES NEEDED? 
</P>
<P>
 If in fact the problems posed by illegal immigration are of such towering 
dimensions, past evidence suggests that drastic, blunt measures won't solve 
them. Proposition 187 would require an illegal-immigration surveillance system 
in the schools that is repulsive even to contemplate. It's ridiculous that 
Proposition 187 purports to be the magic bullet that would end a complex, 
longstanding problem. Trouble is, magic bullets tend to ricochet and hit 
unintended targets. 
</P>
<P>
 2. SO NOTHING CAN BE DONE? 
</P>
<P>
 There is plenty that can be done, should be done and now, finally, is being 
done. The federal government, asleep at the switch for years, is at last 
putting resources on the border; Gov. Pete Wilson, though horribly wrong to 
endorse Proposition 187, has been right to pound on Washington's door, along 
with many members of the California congressional delegation, demanding more 
federal aid to address a problem that is fundamentally a federal 
responsibility: international border control. So a wake-up call, as Proposition 
187 is sometimes referred to, isn't needed. Everybody's awake. All 187 would do 
is make a difficult situation worse. It's not an alert but rather a 
sleep-inducing narcotic that will prolong the nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 3. ISN'T 187'S POTENTIAL IMPACT EXAGGERATED? 
</P>
<P>
 Very probably not. School administrators would be required to peer into the 
faces of children and puzzle over their citizenship. How are they to separate 
the legal from the illegal? Are they going to question a blond, blue-eyed child 
who doesn't look like an "apparent illegal alien," to use 187's key phrase, 
even though she may be here illegally from Canada? Or will they question a 
dark-skinned, brown-eyed child who was born in this country but looks as if she 
might be from Latin America? This is the perniciousness, even terror, of 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The same problem would face doctors in public hospitals and clinics, who would 
be barred from providing all but the most urgent emergency services to illegal 
immigrants. To be sure, the demand for health services by non-citizens is a 
huge challenge. But the remedy that 187 offers would make a bad situation 
worse: deny them immunization and care for contagious but non-emergency 
diseases and you get the worst of both worlds -- they stay here, and they're 
dangerously sick. 
</P>
<P>
 4. WHAT'S A BETTER WAY? 
</P>
<P>
 Keep moving in these directions: better border management; continued economic 
development in the "sending countries" to ease the social pressures that push 
their citizens to come here illegally; bilateral negotiations with the Mexican 
government to permit the orderly cross-border movement of temporary workers 
into agriculture and other industries in which they are needed, a change that 
would relieve a great deal of the stress on our southern border; and a 
tamper-proof Social Security card that would permit U.S. employers to have an 
almost foolproof way of knowing the citizenship status of its workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't pass Proposition 187, California. If it passes, all of us will regret 
it.

WHEN STRANGERS MOURN, A NATION MOURNS; ISRAEL: ACTS OF TERRORISM EVOKE TEARS OF 
BEREAVEMENT AND A SENSE OF PERSONAL LOSS, EVEN WHEN THE VICTIMS ARE UNKNOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

1976.

 Every family has its own style of mourning, and its times and reasons. So does 
each nation. My thoughts can wander around the cities of the world -- Sarajevo, 
Port-au-Prince, Seoul, to the American parents in Italy whose child was killed 
in a drive-by shooting and try to imagine how various groups of people are 
feeling today. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of cultural variations, however, there's a certain kind of crying 
which is common to all mourners: The person in question cries not because he 
knows it's wise to express his feelings, nor in the hope of getting over his 
feelings, nor because he has learned that weeping elicits sympathy and 
understanding. The mourner cries without ulterior motive. He knows, perhaps for 
the first time in his life, that no human being can help him, can restore what 
has been lost. What the death of a loved one does is turn the living person's 
eyes automatically to the invisible, unknown realm into which the other one has 
vanished. You can see this brush of the infinite on the face of anyone in 
mourning. 
</P>
<P>
 In Israel, as stipulated by Jewish law, people "sit shiva" the first week 
after a family member's death. They aren't expected to make conversation with 
condolence callers. They don't listen to music, permit themselves the pleasure 
of parties, of bathing, of meat or alcohol. Freed from the normal social 
conventions, they sit on lowered chairs, such as couches with the cushions 
removed, and just let the grief express itself. These customs are designed to 
unburden the mourner of any sense of responsibility to wear a stiff upper lip, 
to carry on bravely, to try to be happy in spite of the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 I paid a condolence visit to the Waxman family. I cannot claim them as 
friends, though they did once live in our neighborhood. But when, amid all the 
silent people streaming in and out of their living room, I finally caught sight 
of Esther Waxman, feet curled beneath her on their cushion-less sofa, her face 
was startlingly familiar from the newspaper photographs.  
</P>
<P>
 We all knew her. She was the one who had said of the Hamas kidnapers: "They 
talk about the God of us all." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband's face was equally familiar. It was he who had asked that people 
not condemn Yitzhak Rabin for the unsuccessful rescue attempt, and who had 
said: "A father doesn't always say yes to his children. This time God said no, 
and to human beings, God's reasons are usually not apparent. But we still have 
faith in the God of mercy and justice." 
</P>
<P>
 When I went out into the day again, it was a sweet, magnificent autumn 
afternoon. A brush with death can make life itself seem exquisitely precious, 
and this morning was no exception. The sky was so blue, and on the bus ride 
home, the breeze through the window was like a mother's cool hand on my face. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposite me sat a blond, Slavic-looking woman, chin uplifted slightly with 
self-contained dignity, about 50. Though her hands were folded placidly in her 
lap, lips set stoically and face unmoving, after some minutes I noticed tears 
filling her blue eyes. It occurred to me that perhaps she had just come from 
the Waxman home, too, and I leaned forward. "Excuse me," I said, "were you just 
at the . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "Sixteen," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
 I looked around me and suddenly realized that everyone on the bus was utterly 
silent. They were listening to a news bulletin blaring out over the bus radio, 
the Hebrew too fast for my comprehension. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sixteen?" I asked. "Sixteen what?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Sixteen died," she said impassively, as more tears brimmed up in her eyes, 
then trickled down along her cheeks. "In Tel Aviv, Dizengoff Street. There has 
been a bomb." 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out to be more than 16, of course, and the dying more horrible than 
any of us on the bus in Jerusalem then knew. At that moment all I wanted was to 
get home as fast as possible, and have my children safe inside our walls. For 
all families, like nations, have their own style of fear, hope and 
self-protection.

THE STATE; SIMPSON'S ANXIETY: THE LIMELIGHT REDUCES HIM TO A MERE MORTAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

County Criminal Bar Assn.

 There is no constitutional right to a 15 Nielson rating and an 11% audience 
share. Indeed, contrary to the core belief systems of America's tabloid editors 
and TV news directors, there is no mention of rating points in the Bill of 
Rights. There is an amendment, the sixth, entitling a defendant to a speedy and 
public trial that is fundamentally fair. So will the tabloid press allow O.J. 
Simpson a fair trial? 
</P>
<P>
 Fat chance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpson trial is already out of control. The media, especially television, 
is not just an observer but an active and increasingly destructive participant. 
The conduct of the ever more hysterical tabloids, both print and television, 
has created a situation similar to that described by the Heisenberg Principle 
of Uncertainty, which normally applies to physics: Their very coverage of the 
trial has altered it, slowing down the proceedings, affecting who sits on the 
jury and daily interfering with the attorneys' tactical decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 One night last week, the fourth most-important story in the United States was 
that Simpson was busted by jailers for having an unauthorized yellow 
highlighter with him when he returned from court. Also airing on television 
were features on the overhead light in Simpson's Ford Bronco, an interview with 
someone who worked at a Los Angeles Police Department towing service, yet 
another explanation of DNA testing, which may or may not provide a "genetic 
fingerprint," and a critique suggesting that there are only two people in the 
world who believe that detectives were overtaken by "beneficent" motives when 
they entered Simpson's Brentwood home without a warrant the night of his 
ex-wife's murder. By coincidence, those people are Kathleen Kennedy-Powell, who 
presided over the preliminary hearing, and Lance A. Ito, the judge in the 
criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there were the Chung-Povich interviews with Nicole Brown Simpson's 
self-styled "best friend," despite a request from the court that they wait, 
because the high standards of television journalism required that Maury Povich 
and Connie Chung toss slow, fat questions to a "writer" whose veracity is 
questionable. The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences will undoubtedly 
create a new Emmy category: "Best Willing Suspension of Disbelief To Obtain 
Ratings." 
</P>
<P>
 When the media's attorneys reflexively assert "the public's right to know," 
they do not mention the "media's power to interfere" in the trial process. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Chung, sitting in a studio 3,000 miles away, stopped the Simpson trial 
for three days so Ito could explore whether her interview had affected jury 
selection. This is not journalist as observer but journalist as participant. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Stern is beginning to look like a bastion of media sanity. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason the defense seeks a speedy trial for Simpson is simple. The former 
football great is a man toward whom large numbers of Americans show affection, 
because, as an athlete, film star and huckster, he has spent a lot of time in 
our homes, albeit electronically. Insistent and unrelenting press coverage of 
the case threatens to recreate the "so what?" desensitizing phenomenon that 
distorted the first Rodney G. King beating trial. The ceaseless replaying of 
the beating videotape transformed the horrible into the mundane, the ghastly 
into the banal. 
</P>
<P>
 What the defense fears is that Simpson will, in the unblinking TV -- read: 
public -- eye, fall from the status of an "immortal" to what Bertold Brecht 
called the "usual man in the usual place in the defendant's box." 
</P>
<P>
 The King case lurks just below the surface for another reason. When Robert L. 
Shapiro, Simpson's lead counsel, said race is not an issue, he was being 
politic. When Simpson co-counsel Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. said that race 
invariably plays a part in every criminal trial in Los Angeles, he stated what 
everyone in the courtroom and media has been thinking for months. The racial 
theme remains deeply embedded in 1994 Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Marcia Clark may have wanted to put every potential juror on a 
polygraph not simply because she was anxious about media contamination. The 
jury pool is also 37% African American. Bringing Simpson Downtown for trial was 
like taking King to Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Do blacks have a potential hidden agenda? Yes. Do whites have a potential 
hidden agenda? Yes. It is still not unusual for older white jurors to refer to 
black defendants as "those people." Nor is it unusual for black jurors to 
scrutinize a police officer's demeanor more closely than a white juror, 
regardless of the officer's race. It all depends on which end of the stick one 
is used to feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship between the courts, the police and the African American 
community is permeated by suspicion. That grim fact of life lay behind defense 
charges late last week that prosecutors were treating black jury candidates 
differently from others. 
</P>
<P>
 All this as we are about to enter upon the darkest month of the television 
year -- the November Sweeps. Perhaps "journalism" can delay the trial another 
month -- after Povich finds the hairdresser to Simpson's chiropractor who heard 
from an agent that Simpson engaged in Satanic rituals.*

STRONGER THAN STEREOTYPE; A CONVERSATION WITH NOBEL LAUREATE KENZABURO OE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japanese writer Kenzaburo Oe was named winner of the 1994 Nobel Prize for 
Literature. The spotlight of the prestigious award always raises the question 
of a writer's "representativeness." Several years ago, Oe met with 
Japanese-born writer Kazuo Ishiguro (author of "Remains of the Day," among 
other novels), who was raised in England and has written about both England and 
Japan. The following are excerpts from that conversation, in which the writers 
addressed the issue of being grounded in a specific tradition and yet speaking 
to audiences outside it. This dialogue was published in Grand Street magazine 
in 1991 (Issue 38).  
</P>
<P>
 Oe: In my book "The Silent Cry," I wrote about Shikoku. I was born and grew up 
in a mountain village on that island. When I was 18, I went to the University 
of Tokyo to study French literature. As a result, I found myself completely cut 
off from my village, both culturally and geographically. Around that time my 
grandmother died, and my mother was getting older. The legends and traditions 
and folklore of my village were being lost. Meanwhile, here I was in Tokyo, 
imagining and trying to remember those things. The act of trying to remember 
and the act of creating began to overlap. And that is the reason I began to 
write novels. I tried to write them using the methods of French literature that 
I had studied. 
</P>
<P>
 Ishiguro: One of the reasons I think "The Silent Cry" is such a special work 
is that it's often difficult for a writer to get a certain distance from very 
personal events in his life that have touched and disturbed him. This book 
seems to stem from such an event, but at the same time you seem to have kept 
control, to have maintained an artistic discipline, so that it actually becomes 
a work of art that has meaning for everybody. It's not simply about Mr. Oe. It 
strikes me that one of the ways in which you manage that is a certain kind of 
humor, a unique tone. It's very different from the kind of humor found in most 
of Western literature, which is mainly based on jokes. In your books, 
everything has a peculiar sense of humor that is always on the verge of tragedy 
-- a very dark humor. This is one of the ways in which you seem to have been 
able to keep under control events that must be very close to you. But do you 
think this sort of humor is something unique to your own writing, or have you 
gotten it from a larger Japanese tradition? 
</P>
<P>
 Oe: I think that the problem of humor is a very important one. This is one of 
the points in which I differ from Yukio Mishima. Mishima was very strongly 
rooted in the traditions of Japanese literature, especially the traditions of 
the center -- Tokyo or Kyoto -- urban traditions. I come from a more peripheral 
tradition, that of a very provincial corner of the island of Shikoku. It's an 
extremely strange place, with a long history of maltreatment, out there beyond 
the reach of culture. I think my humor is the humor of the people who live in 
that place. 
</P>
<P>
 Ishiguro: I would be quite interested to hear what you feel about Mishima. I'm 
often asked about Mishima in England -- all the time, by journalists. They 
expect me to be an authority on Mishima because of my Japanese background. 
Mishima is very well known in England, and in the West generally, largely 
because of the way he died. But also I suspect that Mishima's image confirms 
certain stereotypical images of Japanese people for the West. Of course, 
committing seppuku is one of the cliches. He was politically very extreme. The 
problem is that the whole image of Mishima in the West hasn't helped people 
there form an intelligent approach to Japanese culture and Japanese people. It 
has perhaps helped people to remain locked in certain prejudices and very 
superficial, stereotypical images of what Japanese people are like. I wonder 
what you think about Mishima and the way he died, what that means for Japanese 
people, and what that means for a distinguished author such as yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 Oe: The observations you just made about the reception of Mishima in Europe 
are accurate. Mishima's entire life, certainly including his death by seppuku, 
was a kind of performance designed to present the image of an archetypal 
Japanese. Moreover, this image was not the kind that arises spontaneously from 
a Japanese mentality. It was the superficial image of a Japanese as seen from a 
European point of view, a fantasy. Mishima acted out that image just as it was. 
He created himself exactly in accordance with it. That was the way he lived, 
and that was the way he died. Edward Said uses the word orientalism to refer to 
the impression held by Europeans of the Orient. He insists that orientalism is 
a view held by Europeans and has nothing to do with the people who actually 
live in the Orient. But Mishima thought the opposite. He said, in effect, "Your 
image of the Japanese is me." But what in fact happened is that Mishima 
presented a false image. As a result, the conception of Japanese people held by 
most Europeans has Mishima at one pole and people like Akio Morita, chairman of 
Sony, at the other pole. In my opinion, both poles are inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Ishiguro: I wonder, Mr. Oe, do you feel responsible for how Japanese people 
are perceived abroad? When you are writing your books, are you conscious of an 
international audience and of what the books will do to Western people's 
perceptions of Japan? Or do you not think about things like that? 
</P>
<P>
 Oe: I was interviewed once by a German television station. The interviewer had 
translated one of my books into German. He asked me whether it was very 
important to me to be translated into German. I said no, and a deathly silence 
fell over the studio. The reason I said no is simply that I write my books for 
Japanese readers rather than for foreigners. Moreover, the Japanese readers I 
have in mind are a limited group. The people I write for are people of my own 
generation, people who have had the same experiences as myself. So when I go 
abroad, or am translated abroad or criticized abroad, I feel rather indifferent 
about it. The responsibilities I feel are to Japanese readers, people who are 
living together with me in this environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking as a reader, foreign literature is very important to me. William 
Blake is important to me. I've written one book based on Blake, and one based 
on Malcolm Lowry. Another book was about a Dante specialist who lives out in 
the country. So in that sense I have been much influenced by foreign 
literature. I read your books in English, for example. Naturally, I believe 
that a real novelist is international. 
</P>
<P>
 For some reason, Japanese writers tend to stay away from international 
writers' conferences. Up to now, at least, there have not been many authors who 
have gone abroad to speak out about Japan's place in the world, about the 
contradictions felt by Japanese writers in the midst of economic prosperity, 
about the things that trouble them deeply. So for my part I am trying to do 
that, little by little. Japan has many very capable businessmen and 
politicians, but as a novelist I want to speak out internationally about things 
that they never mention. And I think it is meaningful for writers from abroad, 
especially young writers like yourself, to come to Japan to look closely at 
this country and to meet Japanese intellectuals. I hope this will lead to a 
deeper understanding of things such as the difficult role played by Japanese 
intellectuals amid material prosperity, and to cultural encounters at a 
genuinely substantial level.

THEATER NOTES; THEY'RE STILL A LONG WAY FROM BUSINESS AS USUAL; THE PANTAGES 
AND HENRY FONDA THEATERS CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH QUAKE EFFECTS -- WHILE SUBWAY 
WORK SHAKES UP THEIR STREET.

 The Henry Fonda Theatre marquee is lighted up after dark. But the letters 
inside the marquee say "CLOSED FOR REMODELING." Meanwhile, across Hollywood 
Boulevard, the Pantages Theatre is open for business -- if you can spot it 
through all the subway construction. 
</P>
<P>
 These are not the best of times for the two big theaters operated by the 
Nederlander Organization. The Pantages recently lost a bid to host "Beauty and 
the Beast," which will go to the Shubert Theatre instead. "We like the 
Pantages," said "Beauty" producer Robert McTyre. But the decision was based on 
"where we thought ("Beauty") could have the longest potential run." The Shubert 
has hosted more long-running shows than the Pantages, he noted. Asked whether 
the subway construction was a factor, McTyre said that Nederlander officials 
"felt it would be completed before we got there. But it made us nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fonda and Pantages also are still recovering from the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake. Citing quake damage, preservationists have been passing out flyers 
that urge authorities to "Save the Pantages Theatre." A recent missive from the 
organizers of the campaign put the cost of quake repairs at the Pantages $1.2 
million and $600,000 at the Fonda. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fonda figure is accurate, Nederlander officials say. Fonda repairs began 
Monday, according to Nederlander West President Stan Seiden, and are expected 
to go on for 75 working days. Seiden attributed the delay since Jan. 17 to the 
process of putting together all the necessary permits. Although the marquee 
indicates a remodeling job, the Fonda will actually keep its current 
configuration. 
</P>
<P>
 Calculating Pantages costs is more difficult. Emergency repairs were completed 
long ago at the Pantages, Seiden said. The theater is safe, he emphasized. "The 
Sound of Music" played two weeks in August, concerts are held frequently, and 
the theater has been used by private groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the theater's decorative ceiling -- a remnant of Hollywood's 
most opulent era -- requires further work, he said. Although theatergoers might 
not notice it, "we know where the plaster has chipped, where the cracks are." 
</P>
<P>
 To finish restoring the ceiling, the Nederlander company applied for more than 
$400,000 in federal earthquake relief grant money through the state-appointed 
Partners in Preservation, but only $100,000 was tentatively approved. 
Acceptance of the grant would require Nederlander to come up with the rest of 
money in order to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ugly fact is that the Pantages Theatre does not have to have the 
embellishments to function as a theater," noted a recent preservationist flyer, 
raising the prospect that the work might not be completed because of its cost. 
</P>
<P>
 But Seiden said Nederlander is determined to restore the ceiling to its former 
glory. It just might take a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Theater manager Kerrin Clark said that the $1.2 million cited as the total 
cost of Pantages repairs in preservationist pamphlets is "a long-range, totally 
comprehensive figure that involves things not related to the quake but which 
need attention. We had to come up with a total plan." Like her boss, Clark 
expressed confidence that Nederlander would see the repairs through: "We want 
people to say, 'Wow! How beautiful!' instead of, 'Gee -- this must have been 
great!' " 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Los Angeles Civic Light Opera subscribers can cross "She 
Loves Me" off their current season. A proposed tour of the Broadway revival 
hasn't been cast yet, Seiden said. A replacement is being sought.

 "BROKEN" MENDED?: L.A. director Ron Link will stage a production of Arthur 
Miller's "Broken Glass" with Linda Lavin and Howard Hesseman next month. It 
will incorporate a new 10-page scene that wasn't in the recent New York 
production; the scene "clears a lot up," Link said. "I can't imagine the play 
without it." 
</P>
<P>
 The only hitch, for L.A. audiences, is that Link's doing it at the Coconut 
Grove Playhouse in Miami. However, Coconut Grove producer Arnold Mittelman said 
he hopes to bring the production to L.A., assuming he can get the L.A. rights 
-- which won't be determined until Miller's representatives have seen the 
Florida production. Mittelman also plans to import a show from L.A. this season 
-- the recent production of "Old Business" starring Harold Gould.

 SAN DIEGO WATCH: Only 17 days away from opening its first show, "A Little 
Night Music," at San Diego Civic Theatre, the new San Diego Music Theatre went 
belly-up, after selling only about 2,500 subscriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gaslamp Quarter Theatre Company, which hasn't presented a full season 
since 1991-92, is back with a new artistic director, Rosina Reynolds, and an 
enterprising series of three plays: Scott McPherson's "Marvin's Room" (Jan. 
26-Feb. 19); Mame Hunt's "Unquestioned Integrity" (March 9-April 2), about the 
Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill hearings, and the premiere of Mark Harelik's "The 
Legacy" (April 27-May 21), the sequel to his often-performed "The Immigrant." 
Gaslamp performs in the 250-seat Hahn Cosmopolitan Theatre in downtown San 
Diego.*

 BAR SAYS BAR IT: Maybe you'd dispute that lawyers are smarter than the rest of 
us. But the Orange County Bar Assn. has come out against Proposition 187, which 
would put restrictions on illegal immigrants. . . . While the bar's lawyers 
don't claim to be smarter, its president, Steve McCracken, says "we have a 
unique, nonpolitical point of view" on it. He says Proposition 187 would spawn 
litigation, tie up courtrooms and probably be thrown out by the courts.

 GETTING SKUNKED: The city of Huntington Beach did try to do something about 
the serious skunk problems in neighborhoods near Central Park. It just didn't 
get much cooperation from the skunks. . . . It hoped to catch 200 in traps, but 
got only 50. Residents may have to figure something else out: The city has run 
out of funds for now to continue the trapping program. The trapped skunks -- 
along with a few possums -- were relocated in a wilderness area.

 EASY TO DIGEST: It's rare that Golf Digest, the golfing bible, runs a cover

not just any amateur. He's the new -- and youngest ever -- winner of the U.S. 
Amateur tournament. At 18, he's now winning at Stanford University. But with 
the lucrative pro tour in sight, Golf Digest says: "Exactly how long Stanford 
will hold onto Woods, now its most famous freshman, is a good question."

 STILL ON THEIR TOES: Last year's Laguna Beach firestorm could have been a 
fatal blow to Ballet Pacifica because so much of its assets were wiped out by 
the flames. But thanks to donations and community support, Ballet Pacifica 
wound up its fiscal year on Oct. 1 with a $17,000 profit. "Quite a few people 
thought we were finished after the fire," says director Molly Lynch. . . . The 
ballet had to come up with 100 new costumes for its upcoming 12-concert series, 
highlighted by December's "The Nutcracker" at the Irvine Barclay Theatre.

 ART LESSON: Forget Walt Disney World. The CalArts campus in Valencia might be 
the duckiest investment Walt Disney ever made. The private arts college is the 
recruiting base for animators that made the company a fortune in recent years 
with hits like "Aladdin" and "The Lion King" (D1). . . . Disney founded the 
school three decades ago.The first animation class graduated in 1976.

 FINAL DRAG: He's raced all across America, but it was the Valley that put Don 
Prudhomme, 53, on the road. Prudhomme, above, who competes in his final race 
today -- the Winston Select Finals at the Fairplex in Pomona -- found the 
Valley great for drag-racing: "You could take those hot rods and go to side 
roads. It was a safe situation. I don't even think cops came out that far."

 SON RISE: P. J. Goossen, 24, will compete in a superwelterweight fight at the 
Warner Center Marriott next week. Ex-pug Pat Goossen, 51, trains and manages 
his son (C12). . . . Pat Goossen separated from family-run Ten Goose Boxing 
before it became lucrative and is playing catch-up by investing in his son's 
career. Early dividends: P. J. is 12-0 with 11 knockouts. Michael Arkush

HUGE DAM TO FLOOD ANCIENT LIFE STYLE; CHINA: THREE GORGES PROJECT ON YANGTZE 
RIVER WILL CLAIM 900 FARM COMMUNITIES AND UPROOT AT LEAST A MILLION PEOPLE. 
IT'S EXPECTED TO TAKE 15 YEARS TO BUILD.

<P>
 Grabbing homemade, rattan sedan chairs, several hundred townspeople rush to 
the dock from all directions in tiny Shibaozhai to wait for the latest Yangtze 
River tourist ships. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, their entrepreneurial spirit hoists the visitors up a steep 
hill to the town's only landmark, a 12-story, 17th-Century red pagoda. 
</P>
<P>
 For such brief, makeshift labor, the people earn as much as they might 
otherwise make in half a day -- less than $1. 
</P>
<P>
 The sedan chair, once considered a despicable form of exploitation and banned 
by the communists in the early 1950s, has made a comeback along the craggy 
banks of the upper Yangtze. There are few other ways of making money, and 
little else to do. 
</P>
<P>
 A day's boat ride from the southern Sichuan city of Chongqing, Shibaozhai and 
its 5,000 people typify the river's small communities. About 200,000 Chinese 
and foreign tourists visit the region's ancient pagodas, temples and natural 
beauty every year. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one stays in Shibaozhai for more than a few hours. And soon it will 
disappear under water -- drowned along with more than 900 other towns and 
villages by a reservoir for the world's largest hydroelectric project, the 
Three Gorges Dam. 
</P>
<P>
 In Shibaozhai, the water level will reach almost 576 feet, raising the river 
to the tower's front door. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the Yangtze, at least a million people will be uprooted, and about 
620,000 acres of farmland will be flooded. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, town centers will be moved within a few miles of their present 
locations. Shibaozhai's new center is planned for higher ground about a mile 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 The imminent flooding and loss of land also mean that hundreds of thousands of 
people will have to find new skills and occupations. The Chinese government 
reportedly plans to open more technical schools in the region and to provide 
grants to develop sideline industries, such as machine repair or restaurants, 
as an alternative to farming. 
</P>
<P>
 But the peasants are skeptical about what will happen next. "The dam will 
create temporary construction jobs here, but they won't last," a prosperous, 
middle-aged farmer said. "We're too far away from the dam itself for anything 
permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The peasants may get new land on higher ground, but they won't be compensated 
for the work they put into their fields already. Unless there is development of 
real industry -- factories, roads and transportation, not more small shops -- 
this place has no hope, dam or no dam." 
</P>
<P>
 Already under construction, the controversial Three Gorges Dam is expected to 
take 15 years to build, cost at least $10 billion and provide 17 million 
kilowatts of electricity. When completed, it will produce as much hydroelectric 
power as the world's two largest dams combined. 
</P>
<P>
 The dam will create a 379-mile-long reservoir between western Hubei Province 
and Chongqing. Water levels will rise hundreds of feet throughout the narrow, 
mountainous stretch of the river, destroying the natural wonder known as Three 
Gorges. 
</P>
<P>
 For the time being, life goes on as usual in Shibaozhai. At the recreation 
center for old cadres, retirees play chess beneath portraits of Mao, Lenin and 
Stalin, and look back rather than forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Shibaozhai's three factories, which produce wine, salt and firecrackers, 
employ only several hundred people. It is the lack of work, not the impending 
relocation, that dominates almost all conversation with outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the streets," said one young medical student who has already made 
plans to move after graduation to Hainan, a southern Chinese island where the 
economy is flourishing. "There are no young people here. There's nothing for 
them here." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of men from Shibaozhai's surrounding rural district of 25,000 people 
have spent recent winters on construction crews in Xinjiang Province in China's 
far northwest. Others end up as coolies in Chongqing, waiting with their 
shoulder poles, along with hundreds of other young men, for a few minutes of 
work carrying heavy loads. 
</P>
<P>
 Their parents are resigned to the exodus. "My only son is in Shenzhen. But 
what else can he do? We need the money," said a 73-year-old man, who had given 
up farming because he could not earn enough to pay the taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Do young people ever return? "Of course they do. At New Year's all the young 
people come home," he said. "Then, they all go away again." 
</P>
<P>
 A young teacher, who has already spent half of his two years at the middle 
school on a leave of absence to work in a restaurant in Guangzhou, summed up 
his plans. "It may take me a long time to get permission to leave for good. But 
someday I will. And I won't come back."

WHITE PAGES TYPECAST POET, PROPHET, JAZZ LOVER; ADVERTISING: DESIGNER LISTINGS 
IN PHONE BOOK CAN INCLUDE DESCRIPTIONS, BOLD FACE, ITALIC, OR OTHER 
TYPOGRAPHICAL DEVICES.

<P>
 You're flipping through the White Pages for a friend's phone number when a 
bold-faced listing jumps out at you: "Tierney, Claudia Hebert. Free-lance 
Writer. Personal Poet." 
</P>
<P>
 Lower down the page is "S. Tilloston, Music Madonna & Bob Barker Fan." Riffle 
back through the alphabet and you'll find "Isaac Morgan, God's Prophet." 
</P>
<P>
 Each paid at least $36 a year for what South Central Bell calls designer 
listings, available in 18 states. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra charge was more than worth it for trucker Edward W. Carr IV. Not 
that he got many sales as "Carr, E. W., Clock Maker and Wood Crafter." 
</P>
<P>
 It's all the calls that don't come in that make it worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 Carr kept his number unlisted for years to avoid calls meant for his father, 
who had retired after 50 years fixing heaters and air conditioners. The extra 
line would make it clear who he wasn't, a saleswoman suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 It worked: "We don't get all those weird phone calls at 2 o'clock in the 
morning: 'Come fix my heater! It's cold!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Not every designer listing includes a description, but most do. Extra lines 
account for 60% of total sales, said Mary Brooks of Birmingham, Ala., South 
Central Bell's product manager for the listings. 
</P>
<P>
 They aren't the only way to stand out: Bold or italic type is $24 annually, 
and bold type set off by lines above and below is $36. 
</P>
<P>
 Designer listings are available in all five South Central Bell states and 13 
of the 14 states with phone service from Pacific Bell, Southwestern Bell, 
Ameritech and Southern Bell. North Carolina regulators haven't yet approved 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell, which covers all of California, charges $6 for each extra line 
in a residential listing, and plans market research next year for fancy 
typography, product manager Brenda Flood said. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra lines have been available for at least a decade, and about 35% of 
all residential listings include them, she estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Orleans directory, a test market in 1992, has by far the largest 
number of such listings for South Central Bell. The 1993-94 directories were 
the first time fancy fonts were offered across the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell won't say how many are sold, but the numbers are going up steadily, 
Brooks said. "People see them and want them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most use the phone directory almost as a business card: Attorney at Law. 
Insurance Agent. Realtor. Photographer. Ladies' Formal Wear Designer. Wall 
Cover Installer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marie E. Spicuzza, Tupperware Consultant," hasn't made any sales from her 
listing, but figures $5 a month is worth it. "I'm optimistic. It'll work out. 
Why not?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 (Apparently never one to waste an opportunity, as the interview wound up, she 
asked, "Have you ever hosted a Tupperware party?") 
</P>
<P>
 "Guy Lillian, Attorney at Law," never expected his $60 a year to bring in 
business. That comes from word of mouth and the Yellow Pages. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little ego thing where you can mark yourself and differentiate 
yourself from the mass on the page," Lillian said. "You're no longer just a 
little line in the huge gray expanse of the phone book page. Now, you're a bold 
streak in the huge gray expanse of the phone book page." 
</P>
<P>
 People hoping for serious business were disappointed. "Norman L. Carter Sr., 
VCR Repairman," and "Cliff Kloesel, Coin Operated Scale Man," plan to appear in 
the future under their names only. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tim and Janet (Jaimie) Causey of Marrero are enthusiastically planning for 
another year as "Causey, T&J, Puppet Ministry Performers." 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Causey estimated that they've received 50 calls and landed 15 to 20 jobs 
for their Sonshine Express Puppet Ministry, including regular work with a local 
hospital for troubled adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
 They and about 30 children -- five of them their own -- give original shows 
designed to promote self-esteem and a willingness to listen to authority rather 
than submit to peer pressure. The group accepts donations, but does not charge 
for the shows, Janet Causey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's actually developed to the point of where it's taking over a lot of our 
lives. I'd say a lot of it was from the piece in the telephone book," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people, such as "Jazz Lover Marshall G. Henderson Sr.," just want a 
self-expressive riff. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yes. Callers in search of a Personal Poet don't even get an answering 
machine, "Music Madonna & Bob Barker Fan's" number has been disconnected, and a 
call to "God's Prophet" was not returned.

KID STUFF IN THE LINCOLN WHITE HOUSE; HISTORY: IT'S TOUGH WHEN YOUR FATHER IS 
COMMANDER IN CHIEF DURING THE CIVIL WAR AND YOUR MOTHER IS BUSY HOLDING 
SEANCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA SLUD, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plenty of White House kids learned it before Chelsea Clinton, or even Amy 
Carter: Growing up in the Washington fishbowl isn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
 It's especially tough when your father is commander in chief during the Civil 
War and your mother is busy holding seances. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what life was like for William and Thomas Lincoln, the first 
presidential children to grow up in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tad," a Family Channel movie starring Kris Kristofferson and Jane Curtin, 
recently finished filming in Richmond and Petersburg. It delves into the 
assassinated President's personal side, beyond the log cabin and the stovepipe 
hat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it fascinating to see Abe Lincoln as a father as well as a chief 
executive," director Rob Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four Lincoln sons were: Edward, who died in 1850 at age 3; Robert, who was 
17 and a Harvard University student when his father was elected President in 
1860; and Tad and Willie, 7 and 10, respectively, when Abraham Lincoln and 
family left Illinois for Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "(They) were kind of hicks in the White House," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, but they managed to have some fun. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the time Tad and Willie took to the roof of the White House to take 
aim at make-believe rebels encamped across the Potomac. And there was Tad's 
wild ride in a goat-pulled cart through one of Mary Todd Lincoln's tea parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Stories of their mischief went down in White House history, but neither 
Lincoln nor his wife recorded much about their boys, said Tom Schwartz, curator 
of the Lincoln collection at the Illinois Historical Library. 
</P>
<P>
 In one story Schwartz tells, the boys interrupt a Cabinet meeting to get the 
President to sign a pardon for one of their dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tad," scheduled to be broadcast in February, explores the darker side of the 
family's life as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1862, a fever -- possibly typhoid from a foul White House water 
supply -- made both boys seriously ill. Willie died two weeks later and Mrs. 
Lincoln began losing her grip on sanity. 
</P>
<P>
 She was duped by spiritualists she invited to the White House to hold seances 
for Willie and Edward, and she couldn't seem to stop buying clothes and White 
House furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
 Until she did some research, Curtin knew little about Mrs. Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
 After reading up on her character, Curtin came to agree with research calling 
Mrs. Lincoln a highly educated, politically astute woman who displayed all the 
signs of manic depression.

ARTISTS FLESH OUT ANNUAL DANSE MACABRE; HALLOWEEN: AT A HUDSON RIVER ESTATE, 
HUGE SKELETONS ARE JOINTED AND JEWELED. THEY WILL FLOAT THROUGH NEW YORK, WITH 
THOUSANDS OF FREE-LANCE PARADERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's an inspiring setting for a group of artists: a 400-acre estate 
overlooking the Hudson River, crimson leaves cascading to the ground with every 
breeze, and a 19th-Century mansion sitting in the long shadows and soft light 
of the low autumn sun. 
</P>
<P>
 But these artists are not painting bucolic landscapes in green and gold. 
</P>
<P>
 No, they're creating an altogether different tribute to the season: Halloween 
skeletons, 15 feet high, with grinning, sequined skulls, gleaming white ribs, 
and neon pink-and-lime costumes that can withstand the glare of city street 
lights. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the secret workshop behind the annual Greenwich Village Halloween 
Parade -- a procession so freewheeling and fabulous that most spectators don't 
realize it's actually a meticulously planned work of art. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't do an event for a million people spontaneously, but we really 
struggle very hard to keep it feeling like that," said parade director Jeanne 
Fleming, who lives behind the elegant mansion of this Ulster County estate in a 
modest, rented cottage. 
</P>
<P>
 For a month each fall, a dozen artists descend upon the place to plan the 
parade and build its larger-than-life puppets. 
</P>
<P>
 On Halloween, the props are trucked 100 miles south to Manhattan, where they 
form the backbone of a spectacle that has 10,000 participants and more than a 
million onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
 About half the marchers are invited guests, including volunteers who carry the 
puppets, jugglers, stilt-walkers and 40 bands playing mariachi music, Dixieland 
jazz, bagpipes, you name it. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the participants -- about 5,000 people -- simply show up at dusk 
and join the party. There are drag queens dressed as Carmen Miranda and Marie 
Antoinette, college roommates disguised as Chinese takeout food and children 
playing the latest super-hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben & Jerry came one year disguised as cows. John Moynihan, son of New York's 
erudite senator, regularly dresses as Death and brings a few dozen friends to 
help carry a 25-foot-long dancing snake. "I do this great Grim Reaper 
cheerleading gag with my scythe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, New York has other large parades, but "you don't have to be Irish or gay 
to join this one," said Mark Kindschi, a set designer who helps build the 
puppets. "You just show up and you're in it." 
</P>
<P>
 And that, said Fleming, is what gives the parade "its extraordinary feeling of 
spontaneity. I never know what it will look like. At the same time, there has 
to be a structure around which all of that can happen, so that when people come 
they're not in the middle of chaos." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's parade takes its theme from Mexico's Day of the Dead -- hence, the 
skeleton puppets dancing on poles, decorated with butterflies, lizards and 
tropical flowers. The centerpiece float will be a giant god of destruction and 
creation with the head of a bird, accompanied by students from a New York 
University dance class in hoop skirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Puppets from past parades also will take part: a spider monkey, a snapping 
toucan, a giant crab, skeletal fish, flapping bats made from umbrellas and even 
some friendly penguins from a previous tribute to Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is known as New York's Mardi Gras, attracting spectators from around 
the world and generating millions of dollars in tourism. That's a pretty good 
return on Fleming's $35,000 budget, a mix of private and government funding 
used for art and office supplies, truck rentals, $50 honorariums for the bands, 
$1,000 stipends for a half-dozen of the most devoted artists and food for 
everyone who shows up in Fleming's kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade was started by Ralph Lee, a Village puppeteer and mask-maker who 
was inspired by the annual Halloween procession in his hometown of Middlebury, 
Vt. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of Lee's puppets had asked him to exhibit his work, but he didn't want 
his creations sitting in a stuffy gallery. So, in 1973, he rounded up 100 
artists and actors to carry the puppets through the streets on Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the route, he staged mini-dramas -- a witches' dance, ghosts haunting a 
Bleecker Street fire escape, a battle between Good and Evil on church steps. 
</P>
<P>
 Other costumed New Yorkers began to tag along and, within a few years, the 
parade had hundreds of marchers and thousands of spectators.

HALLOWEEN SCROOGE STEALS TEXAS BOY'S 100-POUND PRIZE PUMPKIN 
</P>

<P>
 A Halloween scrooge has pulled a trick on a Houston area boy when someone 
stole a nearly 100-pound pumpkin that he had won in a local supermarket 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Ostriyznick guessed the right weight of the pumpkin at a Randall's Food 
Market and took the pumpkin home last Saturday, the same day that he spent 
several hours with his Boy Scout troop helping local flood victims. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday morning, the family discovered that the pumpkin, which was so 
large that it took two men to get it into the back of the family's station 
wagon, was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig, 11, had planned to carve the pumpkin this weekend and roast the seeds, 
but now he must settle for a group of smaller pumpkins provided by the food 
store.

SLAIN ECUADOR MISSIONARIES' PLANE FOUND; AMAZON: DISCOVERY INSPIRES A FAMILY 
CRUSADE TO RECOVER THE PIPER, SALVAGE AS MUCH OF IT AS POSSIBLE AND PIECE IT 
TOGETHER AS A MEMORIAL FOR THE FIVE MEN, WHO WERE KILLED IN 1956. 
</P>

<P>
 Five American missionaries flew into Ecuador's Amazon jungle 38 years ago in a 
yellow Piper. A week later they were all dead, speared by primitive Indians who 
believed they were cannibals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huaorani Indians demolished the single-engine plane on a small landing 
strip on the Curaray River that the Protestant missionaries had code-named Palm 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Days after the Jan. 8, 1956, killings, another missionary flying over the site 
saw no traces of the plane. Everyone assumed that violent tropical storms had 
washed it downriver. 
</P>
<P>
 But last June, amid the martyred missionaries' graves, two members of the clan 
who had done the killing stumbled on a piece of metal sticking out of the sand 
near Palm Beach. They uncovered the front lower fuselage of the Piper, which 
had been piloted by Nathanael Saint of Huntingdon Valley, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery inspired a family crusade to recover the Piper, salvage as much 
of it as possible and piece it together as a memorial to honor the five dead 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints hope this tribute will encourage future missionaries and further 
understanding between two vastly disparate cultures. The number of American 
missionaries has declined worldwide in the past four decades. Some are still 
being martyred. 
</P>
<P>
 Saint's sister, Rachel, 80, has lived peacefully with the Huaorani since 1958, 
when she moved to Ecuador as a translator with the Summer Institute of 
Linguistics (Wycliffe Bible Translators). "Ironically, the Indians are very 
excited about the find," she said. "It's important to them, because the event 
marks an end to their killing." 
</P>
<P>
 After the initial find, Nate Saint's son Stephen, 43, of Ocala, Fla., took 
charge of the search for the rest of the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strange thing was that I had just met a pilot in Russia who told me his 
dream was to find and salvage Dad's plane," he said. "So when I heard, I got 
right on a plane to Ecuador." 
</P>
<P>
 Joining in the search are Steve's son Jaime, 17, and his brother, Philip, 
along with several Huaorani and William Clapp, a pilot for Mission Aviation 
Fellowship in Shell, Ecuador. Nate Saint piloted the plane for the fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
 The team is steadily recovering half-buried, scattered parts. Each recovery 
stirs memories of a mission that began with hope and ended in horror. 
</P>
<P>
 Discovery of the plane's fragments, said Steve Saint, is "almost as if God is 
saying, 'I want you to remember what happened here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 All five victims were young. Nate Saint was 32; James Elliot of Portland, 
Ore., 28; Edward McCully of Milwaukee, 28; Peter Fleming of Seattle, 27, and 
Roger Youderian of Lansing, Mich., 31. 
</P>
<P>
 For several months before the landing at Palm Beach, the missionaries 
periodically flew from Shell over the Huaorani village in the Amazon rain 
forest, or Oriente. 
</P>
<P>
 To win the trust of the reclusive Indians, the men dropped gifts of machetes 
and aluminum kettles. In return, the Huaorani gave the Americans gifts, 
including a live parrot. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Huaorani are primitive, semi-nomadic hunters. They have fiercely guarded 
their territory for centuries, earning a reputation for savagery. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christians were fully aware of the danger, so they kept their mission a 
secret. 
</P>
<P>
 Their landing was uneventful. For four days, they saw no people. On the fifth 
day, three naked Huaorani, two women and a man, walked out of the jungle. 
Fist-size balsa wood ornaments hung in their distended earlobes. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the meeting was amicable. The missionaries cooked hamburgers for 
their visitors, shared insect repellent with them, even took them for rides 
over the dense green forest in the yellow Piper, which the Indians named the 
"wood bee." 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans showed the Huaorani a photograph of Dayuma, a woman from their 
tribe who had fled many years before, during a wave of intra-tribal killings. 
</P>
<P>
 The missionaries' friendly gestures didn't save their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 George, the Americans' nickname for the Huaorani man who had greeted them, 
told the tribe that the white men were cannibals who had attacked him. 
</P>
<P>
 This belief was reinforced by the photograph of Dayuma. George said the image 
proved that the missionaries had possession of her spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after the missionaries and the Huaorani met, six tribal warriors 
attacked Palm Beach. One by one, they slaughtered the missionaries with 9-foot 
spears. Although the missionaries were armed, they chose to fire their guns 
into the air instead of shooting the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1958, two Huaorani women told Rachel Saint and Elisabeth Elliot, James 
Elliot's widow, that the Indians had come to recognize that the killings were a 
mistake. For his lies, George was speared to death. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huaorani and American women returned with Dayuma to the tribe to finish 
the missionaries' work. Rachel Saint and Dayuma still live in the village of 
Tonampare, a muddy clearing ringed by tin-roofed shacks near Palm Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Differing experts estimate the number of Huaorani today at 600 to 1,300. Most 
of them live on a reservation in Ecuador's Yasuni National Park and have 
abandoned their Stone Age ways.

TRIBE GOT SURPLUS U.S. EQUIPMENT; INDICTMENTS: RECORDS SHOW THE SIOUX NEVER SAW 
MILLIONS' WORTH OF GEAR ORDERED IN ITS NAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To Russell Hawkins, the end of the Persian Gulf War was the beginning of a 
bonanza. 
</P>
<P>
 When the war ended in 1991, the federal government was swamped with heavy 
equipment it no longer needed. Hawkins, nearing the end of a decade as chairman 
of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe, learned he could use the tribe's name to 
get much of that equipment free. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next two years, prosecutors say, people linked to Hawkins got $63 
million in government equipment, carting away machinery from earth movers to 
missile parts, all in the name of helping the unemployed among the 9,200-member 
tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 But records show the lion's share of proceeds lined the pockets of Hawkins' 
non-Indian business associates. The tribe never saw millions of dollars' worth 
of gear ordered in its name. And it sold other equipment worth millions for a 
small fraction of its worth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was basically organized crime," said Steve Jackson, who worked briefly for 
the tribe in 1993 in a failed effort to clean up the program. 
</P>
<P>
 All the while, the Bureau of Indian Affairs watched the scheme unfold and 
didn't stop it until this February. Although it's the agency's job to make sure 
Indian tribes run their affairs legally, BIA officials either ignored it or 
actively participated, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they did by turning a blind eye to it was that they sanctioned it. They 
were aware because we told them about it," said Andrew Laverdure, a top BIA 
administrator in Sisseton at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Four men and one company have been indicted, and a federal probe continues. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Hawkins hired Roger Raether to get surplus food and clothing for 
tribal members. Many Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux live in poverty; in 1990, 
according to U.S. Census figures, tribal members had a median annual income of 
about $10,000 and an official unemployment rate of more than 23%. 
</P>
<P>
 When Raether discovered the tribe had no money to pay for shipping the 
material to the Lake Traverse Reservation, Hawkins suggested obtaining and 
reselling government equipment to raise money, Raether says in court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus was born Dakota Machinery Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Two non-Indians -- Francis (Butch) Oseby and Donald Jerke, both of Sioux Falls 
-- and tribe member Warren Barse formed the company in April, 1991, on the same 
day the tribe's lawyer wrote to Hawkins saying the plans were legal. 
</P>
<P>
 Raether and Oseby would look for surplus equipment; the tribe would obtain it; 
DME would buy it from the tribe, paying pennies on the dollar for equipment 
worth millions. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, DME paid the tribe just $500 for a semi-truck tractor worth more 
than $68,000. That truck was part of about $10 million in government equipment 
seized from DME in a raid earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Raether also turned a hefty profit from his dealings with the tribe. During 
1992, Raether made more than $130,000 in commissions on the sale of government 
equipment, tribal records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Raether was amazed by the amount of money and equipment changing hands, but 
Hawkins assured him everything was legal, said Raether's lawyer, Frank Denholm: 
"He couldn't believe what was going on himself. But everybody was doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Raether traveled thousands of miles looking for equipment. In just the first 
week of February, 1992, for example, he logged 3,594 miles visiting military 
bases in Illinois, Tennessee, Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma and Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 He traveled in style on that trip, driving a purple 1991 Lincoln Town Car 
leased by Valley Systems Inc. of Canal Fulton, Ohio. Shelley Valentine, 
daughter of that company's founder, was a player in the surplus enterprise as 
well, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Records indicate Valentine -- who has not been charged with any crime -- used 
the Sisseton-Wahpeton tribe's name to get at least $9.5 million in government 
equipment during 1991 for herself and her father's company. 
</P>
<P>
 The equipment went to warehouses in northeast Ohio -- more than 800 miles from 
the Sisseton-Wahpetons' home in northeastern South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first five months of 1992, Raether and Valentine got more than 
$134,000 from the tribe's surplus equipment account. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about $21,000 from that account paid for work by tribal members. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Where was the Bureau of Indian Affairs during all of this? 
</P>
<P>
 Bureau official Laverdure noticed something was wrong, and repeatedly warned 
the agency over a four-year period. But his supervisors did nothing, and a 
frustrated Laverdure eventually took early retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The BIA has done that before. When something goes wrong, they let it go until 
it goes away by itself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And prosecutors say one BIA official, Charles Hacker, was deeply involved in 
the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 They say Hacker, then a transportation official in the BIA's Albuquerque, 
N.M., office, provided hundreds of pre-signed equipment transfer forms that 
allowed Oseby, Raether and others to work without the usual BIA oversight. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, Oseby gave Hacker at least $7,000 in cash and offered him a 
$10,000 loan to buy a home, prosecutors say. Hacker admitted to federal agents 
that he took the payments, but insisted they were loans, not bribes. 
</P>
<P>
 Oseby also obtained a $500 stereo from an Air Force base in New Mexico and 
sold it to Hacker for $50, according to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 The intrigue began unraveling in late 1992, when Lorraine Rousseau defeated 
Russell Hawkins in a tribal election by 12 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rousseau pledged to clean up corruption in the tribal government and took 
evidence of the scheme to federal prosecutors. She also hired two longtime 
Hawkins critics, Steve Jackson and Maynard Bernard, and told them to find a way 
to run the equipment program legally. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard and Jackson were temporary employees, however, and were not rehired 
after about six weeks on the job. Rousseau says the tribe didn't have enough 
money to pay them, while Jackson says he suspects Rousseau wanted to run the 
equipment program herself. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer of 1993, the latest of several federal investigations of the 
scheme began bearing fruit. Hawkins became DME's sales manager after he left 
office, and used his contacts with the Seminole Tribe of Florida to attempt 
similar equipment deals. 
</P>
<P>
 The scheme drew the attention of federal officials when Raether obtained a 
300-ton crane for the Florida Seminoles from a naval yard in San Diego. Hawkins 
signed documents for the Seminoles selling the crane to DME for $34,000, and 
Jerke began trying to sell it. His price? $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government's property management agency, the General Services 
Administration, became suspicious. GSA official Peggy Lowndes called Raether to 
ask about the attempts to sell the crane, with federal agents listening in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know anything about that, OK?" Raether responded, according to court 
papers. "All I do is acquire the stuff for the Seminoles, OK?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Raether and Jerke are charged with conspiracy and with lying to the GSA about 
the crane, which the GSA recovered before it left California. Oseby is charged 
with conspiracy and with bribery; Hacker is charged with bribe-taking. DME is 
indicted on charges of receiving illegally converted tribal property. 
</P>
<P>
 All have pleaded not guilty. Hacker's trial is scheduled for January; the 
others are to go on trial in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins has not been charged. He declined repeated requests for an interview. 
His popularity appears to be unaffected by the scandal; he received 460 votes 
in his bid for a sixth term as chairman of the tribe, while Rousseau and 
Bernard tied for second place in the six-way race with 155 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rousseau and Bernard will compete in a runoff to face Hawkins in the general 
election Nov. 8.

GAY RIGHTS AND RELIGIOUS RIGHT ON COLLISION COURSE ON IDAHO'S PLAINS; ELECTION: 
PROPOSITION 1 WOULD PROHIBIT THE STATE GOVERNMENT FROM GIVING HOMOSEXUALS 
PROTECTION UNDER DISCRIMINATION LAWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 From his mountainside home, Kelly Walton has a commanding view of the 
irrigated farmland and sagebrush plains of southern Idaho. On a clear day, he 
can see the Sawtooth Mountains, 120 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Walton also spies more ominous things on the horizon: Godlessness. Crumbling 
morals. A social and spiritual decay spreading across the nation, sapping its 
strength and stealing its soul. 
</P>
<P>
 His rural neighbors do not always share Walton's alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell them: Do you have a television? Do your kids watch MTV? Do you watch 
the news? It's everywhere," Walton said. "Nowhere in the country are we safe 
from people who want to portray a very deadly behavior as healthy and normal." 
</P>
<P>
 He's talking about homosexuality. As chairman of the Idaho Citizens Alliance, 
Walton is the driving force behind a Nov. 8 ballot measure called Proposition 
1. It has a lot of Idaho residents talking about homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 1 would prohibit Idaho's state or local governments from giving 
homosexuals protection under anti-discrimination laws. It would bar public 
schools from suggesting homosexuality is acceptable, and would require 
libraries to keep books on homosexuality away from minors. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballot measure alone makes Walton noteworthy. Conservative Christians 
tried to put anti-gay rights measures on the ballot this year in 10 states and 
succeeded in only two: Idaho and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 But more is at stake here than a ballot measure. Homosexuality is just the 
first issue Walton wants to tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 He's part of an increasingly vocal movement of conservative Christians 
translating their religious beliefs into political action. From school board 
elections to national Republican Party politics, the so-called "religious 
right" is making its presence felt throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In Idaho, Walton has jump-started a new political coalition. His opponents 
have responded by doing the same. Now homosexuality, which most Idaho residents 
would be happy to ignore, is the state's hottest issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Idaho boosters like to call this "the last best place," and in many ways the 
state is a vestige of what the nation used to be: mostly rural, white and 
middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a family values kind of place -- a good place, Kelly Walton believes, to 
fight for the soul of America. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Turn off Interstate 84, head south on Highway 30, and you'll know you're in 
Heyburn (population 2,714) when you see a big billboard in a cow pasture. It 
says: "Prepare To Meet Thy God." 
</P>
<P>
 Drive another mile, past the grain bins of Western Seed, and you'll find a 
small cinder-block office. This is Walton Inc., a family-run construction 
business, and inside is Kelly Walton. 
</P>
<P>
 He is 38, soft-spoken and unfailingly polite. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also capable of stirring up the strongest of emotions. Opponents brand 
him as a mean-hearted, homophobic zealot. The governor recently called him one 
of Idaho's "voices of hatred and intolerance." An anonymous caller left this 
message on his answering machine: "You're a dead man, you Nazi swine." 
</P>
<P>
 Walton shrugs off the criticism. "It takes a lot of guts to share the truth 
sometimes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, most Idaho residents had never heard of Kelly Walton. 
</P>
<P>
 He came here from California in 1975 at age 19, moving with his parents. He 
stayed until 1979, working in his father's construction business, then moved to 
Oregon with his newlywed wife, Miriam. 
</P>
<P>
 He became active in the Oregon Citizens Alliance, a group dedicated to 
opposing gay rights and fielding conservative Christian candidates. But in 
1990, Walton returned to the family business in Idaho, saying he was burned out 
on politics. 
</P>
<P>
 By January, 1993, he was back in the fray. Two months earlier, Oregon voters 
had rejected an OCA-backed initiative that labeled homosexuality "unnatural and 
perverse." Now Walton, with OCA chairman Lon Mabon at his side, was announcing 
the formation of the Idaho Citizens Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Its first goal: to put an anti-gay rights initiative on the Idaho ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Things moved slowly at first. The family business contributed more than 
$50,000 last year in cash and in-kind contributions to help Walton tap the 
public sentiment he believed was out there. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Walton and ICA Executive Director Bill Proctor drove around Idaho for 
two weeks, speaking in churches and restaurants, asking shopkeepers to put 
initiative petitions on their counters. 
</P>
<P>
 Walton says he found widespread agreement for his message that homosexuality 
is unhealthy and immoral. The proof, he says, is in the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 By July, 1,200 volunteers statewide had collected 38,510 valid signatures, 
well over the 32,000 needed to put the measure on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Walton believes supporters include even some people who publicly oppose 
Proposition 1. That's because criticizing homosexuality is politically 
incorrect, he said, "but they'll get behind that curtain and vote yes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is 7 a.m. in Boise, and Brian Bergquist is arriving at the No On 1 
Coalition headquarters for an interview. First, however, he must figure out how 
to turn off the alarm system. 
</P>
<P>
 As coalition chairman, he also has gotten threatening phone calls, including 
one from a man who said he intended to blow Bergquist's head off. 
</P>
<P>
 With the alarm off, Bergquist leads the way into a low-rent suite of rooms. 
It's hard to say which is uglier, the dingy brown carpet or dingy brown 
paneling. Bergquist looks around proudly. Donated, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay activism bloomed late in Idaho. Boise's first gay pride march was in 1990, 
and across much of rural Idaho, a gay or lesbian still has two basic lifestyle 
choices: in the closet or out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergquist was one of the first activists here willing to go public. But just 
as Walton lacks the brimstone of a cable TV preacher, neither is Bergquist an 
in-your-face activist. 
</P>
<P>
 He is 36, soft-spoken and unfailingly polite. 
</P>
<P>
 The low-key approach has worked well. The No On 1 Coalition raised more than 
$183,000 in donations from July through September, compared to less than 
$20,000 raised by initiative backers. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition enjoys support outside the gay community. Nearly every elected 
official in Idaho, Democratic and Republican, opposes Proposition 1. The 
attorney general called the measure unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 But the voters' dilemma remains: 
</P>
<P>
 Is Proposition 1 needed to keep homosexuals from gaining special rights, as 
Walton argues? Or will it deny them basic civil rights that are supposed to be 
enjoyed by all, as Bergquist argues? 
</P>
<P>
 It's a tossup as to how voters will lean, says Gary Moncrief, political 
science professor at Boise State University. Homosexuals won't win any 
popularity contest in Idaho, but there's also a strong tradition here of 
minding one's own business. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, conservative Christian soldiers are marching into politics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christian Coalition, founded by evangelist Pat Robertson, claims more than 
1 million members. Its influence in the Republican Party was evident in 
September at the group's annual conference, which featured three 1996 
presidential prospects: former Vice President Dan Quayle, Sen. Phil Gramm of 
Texas and former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
 Religious-right activists reportedly control or dominate nearly 20 state 
Republican parties. Christian groups are sponsoring hundreds of candidates for 
school boards, city councils and state legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Homosexuality has become a rallying issue for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado voters approved a 1992 initiative prohibiting local governments from 
passing laws protecting homosexuals, but the law never took effect and has been 
declared unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court. The case is bound for the 
U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colorado measure was a model for initiative campaigns this year in 10 
states: Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, 
Oregon and Washington. But the campaigns gathered enough signatures only in 
Idaho and Oregon, where the OCA is trying again, this time without the 
"unnatural and perverse" language.

BOSNIA'S CHILDREN WHO SURVIVE ARE ALSO VICTIMS; BALKANS: KILLERS KNOW THAT THE 
DEATH OF A CHILD DEMORALIZES THE FAMILY. PSYCHIATRISTS ON A SPECIAL MISSION ARE 
ATTEMPTING TO EASE THE MENTAL TRAUMA. 
</P>

<P>
 The children of Bosnia are afraid of the light, not the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 The dark offers cover from snipers. In this war, snipers systematically kill 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 This war not only kills with bullets but has introduced AIDS into the country. 
In this war, teen-age girls turn to prostitution for cigarettes and food. 
</P>
<P>
 About 6,000 of Sarajevo's 60,000 children have been killed. At least 14,000 
have been wounded. Most Bosnians have lost at least one member or relative in a 
war that has gone on around them for almost three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The war has left psychological scars as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Three mental health professionals from the University of Missouri are working 
with the country's teachers, training them to act as mental health-care lay 
persons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first child I talked with saw his father killed in front of him," said 
Dr. Arshad Husain. "He later lost his mother, and all his siblings. This child 
is just 10 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 Husain, a native of India, is chief of child psychiatry at Missouri 
University's Hospitals and Clinics and a professor of psychiatry and neurology. 
He has an international reputation and received a call from Bosnia asking for 
help. His trip there in September was his fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 He says the children are suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome, 
similar to that experienced by Vietnam veterans. They are hungry, cold and 
grief-stricken. They have flashbacks, nightmares, suffer from depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Their local teachers, as classwork, had assigned the youngsters to draw 
pictures of their experiences -- much as they might assign scenes from a class 
trip, the sort of rudimentary crayon drawings that decorate refrigerators 
across America. 
</P>
<P>
 The scenes these children drew are shocking. They drew tanks and guns and 
bodies and bullets, the horrors the war has brought to the very young. 
</P>
<P>
 Their teachers, untrained, saw no value in such assignments, Husain said. 
Instead they were protective. Their theory was to keep the children busy with 
their studies and not allow them to talk about the atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers were unaware of the therapeutic value of such assignments or 
even, Husain said, "the therapeutic value of crying. They thought one way to be 
strong was not to cry in front of the children. Many of the teachers were 
having lack of concentration and hyperactivity themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reluctantly, they allowed us to interview the first batch of children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was crying. They were crying. The teachers were crying. The children were 
telling us how their mothers were killed, how their fathers were killed in 
front of them. People from the teachers group then started talking about their 
fears." 
</P>
<P>
 And that was the Americans' first breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Husain, the other American professors are Dr. Bill Holcomb and Dr. 
Teru Morton, both clinical associate professors of psychiatry and neurology at 
the MU School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Holcomb worked with frustrated teen-agers, youngsters who could no longer go 
into the mountains to ski. The first time he went, the American team got there 
just as the cease-fire occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was hardly anybody out," Holcomb said. "They had literally been in 
basements for 22 months. There were no stores, no restaurants open, but what 
was really impressive was to see the people as they began working. It was just 
great to see the human spirit there, cleaning up glass. When the shelling 
stopped, it was like each day a flower opened." 
</P>
<P>
 Holcomb said that as he walked the devastated streets of Sarajevo -- a city 
that had been called the "Paris of the Balkans" -- people clapped for him just 
because he was an American. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. planes had shot down some Serbian planes and they wanted us there, 
they wanted us to intervene," Holcomb said. "There was a great feeling of 
helplessness. They felt like they had been abandoned by everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers, he said, all remembered the 1984 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 But now those mountains where they had skied were the stronghold of the 
snipers. They desperately wanted to get into those mountains and they could 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bosnian teen-agers claim they are not afraid of death," Holcomb said. 
"They're worried about being maimed and becoming invalids. Their lack of fear 
about death probably has to do with the fact that they've seen so much of it. . 
. . It's been demystified for them." 
</P>
<P>
 The psychiatrists have trained about 300 of the nation's 5,000 teachers so far 
and are training some of them to train more teachers. According to Holcomb, 
most of the country's native mental health professionals fled when the war 
began. 
</P>
<P>
 Holcomb has photographs of two famous libraries in Sarajevo that no longer 
exist. One housed rare Oriental documents; the other, beautiful with 
stained-glass windows, was the largest library in the Balkans. Today the 
students can't even get paper for schoolwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Husain noted that the team members wore flak jackets and helmets, and were on 
the street while mortar shells exploded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Denial was our best friend," he said. "We did not run for cover." 
</P>
<P>
 He also sympathizes when the youngsters complain of the cold. He and his team 
would be bundled in six or seven layers of clothing, but still they would head 
for the warmest corner of any room. 
</P>
<P>
 In one survey, 900 out of 1,000 children said they didn't want to live. They 
thought they would die from the cold. 
</P>
<P>
 The third member of the team, Teru Morton, says she wished she had had a 
camera with her when she met with a group of women who had been widowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were as blank-eyed and ghostly group as you could see," she said. She 
also heard of children who, instead of attending school, had become caretakers 
for surviving parents who had curled up in fetal positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans report that the killing of the children has completely 
undermined family units, the fiber of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 If a husband and a wife and their child were walking together down the street, 
said Morton, the snipers would deliberately shoot the child, a devastating 
situation in a nation that remains very family-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
 The children remain the focus of the Americans' efforts. "The ones we don't 
see, the ones we hear about, are probably the ones who need the most help," 
Morton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Husain told of one little boy who would run for the basement when his father 
snored at night. The snoring sounded to him like shelling. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of the schoolchildren, the team reported, also have vision problems, 
probably from a poor diet. Some of the people had not had any beef for 22 
months when the Americans arrived. Many survived on a bread and rice mixture, a 
casserole in which all available food was just thrown in. 
</P>
<P>
 Most overwhelming to the psychiatrists was the feeling of helplessness, that 
things were not going to get better. 
</P>
<P>
 Husain says that depression, sleep disorders, lack of concentration, might get 
worse when and if peace comes. Now, he says, at least there is a tremendous 
amount of energy being spent in simply surviving, in staying alive. He says 
that when things are calmer the trauma may come back tenfold. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took us a long time to win their trust, to show that we were going to keep 
coming back," he said. "This is not a one-shot program. It's an ongoing 
effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Husain has traveled to small villages outside Sarajevo where he says things 
are just as bad. He believes a similar program of teachers empowered to become 
mental health lay persons could benefit parts of rural Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extremely cost effective and teachers know the children well. They know 
when they're behaving and when they're misbehaving and it's a natural situation 
for them to help. They see the children more than their own parents and often 
know them better." 
</P>
<P>
 In Sarajevo, the children are once again drawing pictures, however haunting, 
expressing their anxieties in art. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, with group therapy added, the Americans seem confident mental health 
will improve. 
</P>
<P>
 The professors are donating their time. Their first two trips to Bosnia were 
sponsored by the Taibah International Aid Assn., a Washington-based 
organization funded by Muslims. UNICEF and other agencies are picking up the 
rest of the bills.

FATHERS JOIN FIGHT ON INFANT MORTALITY; PEDIATRICS: HEALTHY START DRAWS PRAISE 
AS IT REACHES INTO DEPRESSED NEIGHBORHOODS, TEACHING MEN AND PREGNANT WOMEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Willie Ricks was a creature of Baltimore's rundown Harlem Park and 
Sandtown-Winchester neighborhoods. He did drugs among the boarded-up row houses 
and, as a teen-ager, fathered a little girl. 
</P>
<P>
 But a federal program -- and two more babies -- taught Ricks the meaning of 
fatherhood and its connection to manhood, something the streets never did. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction-worker tough with dark, piercing eyes, Ricks is now a part of the 
lives of his baby girls, 1-year-old Dorlene and 2-year-old Renee. He reads to 
them and works in their nursery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, I was doing construction. I was a man. I was always a man. When I 
became involved in this program, I became a father," said Ricks, 30. "I came 
from the streets, from hard times. I didn't care about nothing. It was just me 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Ricks' life changed when the mother of his youngest children enrolled in 
Healthy Start, a federally funded program to reduce infant deaths in Baltimore 
and 14 other communities with very high rates of infant mortality. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will spend $89 million on 
Healthy Start this year. HHS announced recently that it is expanding the 
program for the first time since 1991 to seven additional communities, 
including the Mississippi Delta. 
</P>
<P>
 On Baltimore's west side, Healthy Start is reaching 900 low-income families 
with 100 employees, many of them current and former welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 Every six to eight weeks, these neighborhood health advocates canvass the 
trash-strewn streets of Sandtown-Winchester and Harlem Park. 
</P>
<P>
 They knock on every door in search of pregnant women who may need prenatal 
care, nutrition counseling, parenting advice, treatment for substance abuse, 
transportation to the doctor, a hot lunch or just someone to talk to, services 
provided by Healthy Start at a former high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't take no for an answer," said Judy Washington, a recruitment 
supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy is to find the women when they are pregnant, and then use the 
opportunity to encourage healthier behaviors and family relationships. There is 
a strong emphasis on breast-feeding and preventing unplanned pregnancies. The 
women stay in the program for the first three years after the birth of their 
babies. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a long-term infant-mortality strategy, the time after the pregnancy is 
just as critical as during pregnancy," said Tom Coyle, assistant commissioner 
for the city's Health Department, which runs Healthy Start. "You have much more 
time to work with the woman around her life goals, her health issues, and 
particularly family planning." 
</P>
<P>
 Timeka Harrison, whose baby is due in mid-November, says she was four months 
pregnant when she saw the recruiters on her street. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison, whose smile reveals a gold tooth stamped with a dollar sign, could 
not bring herself to approach them. She stood on her porch and hoped they would 
notice her swelling belly and not mistake her condition as "just fat." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was rubbing my stomach and finally they came over," said Harrison. She says 
Healthy Start has been helpful, especially the support group for mothers. "It's 
like a big old family, like a bunch of sisters." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen so many people in one room that could get along," added Tina 
Dixon, who lost her job and her car when she got pregnant with her second child 
and then tried to starve herself because she was so depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Healthy Start found her in time. 
</P>
<P>
 "They help you, talk you through your problems," said Dixon as she held a 
healthy 5-month-old boy in her lap. 
</P>
<P>
 Coyle says the program's heavy reliance on hiring welfare recipients is 
unique. Recruiting in the neighborhood puts money back into the community and 
results in Healthy Start employees who can relate to the problems of young 
women struggling to survive amid violence, few opportunities and little hope. 
</P>
<P>
 The program also reaches out to the fathers because it has found a very strong 
male influence on the women while they are pregnant and after they give birth. 
This influence, the program says, is reflected in the decisions the women make 
about breast-feeding and family planning.

NASA MAKES DOWN-TO-EARTH CUTS; BUDGET: TO COPE WITH THE LATEST SHORTFALL AND 
WHAT LIES BEYOND, THE AGENCY IS SCRUTINIZING EVERY SHUTTLE-RELATED JOB TO SEE 
WHERE MORE MONEY CAN BE SAVED WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING FLIGHT SAFETY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the old days, NASA only had to ask for what it wanted. Congress was only 
too willing to oblige. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the space agency has a shrinking budget and new ways of doing business. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the new NASA, looking to save a million here and a million there: 
</P>
<P>
 * Want to launch? Better settle for a weekday to avoid hundreds of thousands 
of dollars in weekend overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
 * Weather lousy? Then call off liftoff before fueling and save $400,000 in 
tanking costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The coupon-clipping crowd has gotten hold of NASA's space shuttle program. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuttle funding dropped to $3.15 billion in the new fiscal year that began 
this month, $360 million less than the year before. NASA's total budget for the 
new fiscal year is $14.4 billion, down about $130 million. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA expected less for shuttle operations, but not that much less, considering 
all the previous cutbacks. The shuttle budget has shrunk nearly $1 billion 
since 1992, or 21%. 
</P>
<P>
 To cope with the latest shortfall and what lies beyond, NASA is scrutinizing 
every shuttle-related job to see where more money can be saved without 
jeopardizing flight safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen teams, comprising nearly 100 NASA employees, are assessing the jobs at 
Kennedy Space Center, Johnson Space Center in Houston, Marshall Space Flight 
Center in Huntsville, Ala., and Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. The study 
is supposed to be completed by January. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been coming down the last three years about 5% a year in operations in 
the shuttle, and we all felt like this is the time when we need to take a 
snapshot and see where we are," said Bryan O'Connor, shuttle director and a 
former shuttle commander. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have we gone too far in some areas? Are there some other areas where we can 
reduce even more?" 
</P>
<P>
 Just the thought of more cuts distresses the head of the Aerospace Safety 
Advisory Panel, an independent group created by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,400 shuttle-processing jobs have been scrapped at Kennedy in the 
last three years, and numerous shuttle improvements have been deferred. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're right on the ragged edge now," said panel chairman Norman Parmet, a 
retired TWA executive. "As this thing squeezes to the point where they can't do 
what's necessary, the only answer is you have to cut down the schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 "Something's going to give," Parmet said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuttle officials insist that safety will remain the No. 1 priority. They 
acknowledge, however, that they'll lose flexibility as positions and parts 
dwindle. And that means launch delays. 
</P>
<P>
 "These cuts are becoming more and more painful, and we have to delete more and 
more things that we wish we would not have to delete," said Brewster Shaw, a 
shuttle manager and former shuttle commander. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA hopes its work force study will minimize the pain. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor insists that "everything's fair game." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, not exactly. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the four space shuttles will be mothballed, and neither of the two 
launch pads will be closed, O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't really save anything (by doing that)," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he said, NASA will need three shuttles and seven shuttle flights a 
year when it comes time to build the international space station. The fourth 
shuttle -- Columbia, the oldest and heaviest -- will be dedicated to 
non-station missions. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA will launch the first U.S. station component in December, 1997, said 
Jeremiah Pearson III, head of NASA's space flight office. He won't guarantee 
the launch dates of any shuttle missions before or after that, especially if 
the budget continues to shrivel. 
</P>
<P>
 Also sacrosanct are engine improvements and anything having to do with safety, 
Pearson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's a safety issue, it will be funded," he promised. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuttle workers can expect less overtime, though, and managers will be asked 
to find additional ways to do the job "cheaper, faster and better" -- the motto 
of NASA's administrator of 2 1/2 years, Daniel Goldin. 
</P>
<P>
 More job cuts are inevitable. NASA currently is replacing only about half of 
those who retire or quit. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, at least, the efficiencies seem to be working. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are doing a better job. There are fewer mistakes," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
 This continual streamlining challenges "all our traditional ways of doing 
things," O'Connor said. For instance, NASA last spring called off Columbia's 
launch the day before because of dismal weather forecasts -- a first in 13 
years of space shuttle flight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We said, 'Hey, look, what's the point of this? We know it's going to be bad 
tomorrow,' " Pearson recalled. "But we've always done it this way. But we 
didn't (this time). We didn't tank. Four hundred thousand bucks." 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia soared the following day, a Friday, into a clear sky. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look to launch on Thursdays instead of Sundays," Pearson added. "Why? It 
costs less money." 
</P>
<P>
 Countdowns begin three days before launch, thus the penchant for Thursdays. 
Start the countdown on Monday and try to launch on Thursday or, failing that, 
on Friday -- no weekend overtime. Or if Monday is a holiday, start the 
countdown on Tuesday and launch on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the six space shuttle launches so far this year were on a Thursday or 
Friday; the exception was a twice-delayed flight. The year's last liftoff is 
scheduled for this Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, only two of seven shuttle launches fell on a Thursday or Friday.

U.S. LAWYER ON HUNGER STRIKE FOR LOST GUERRILLA SPOUSE; GUATEMALA: JENNIFER 
HARBURY SAYS SHE'LL STARVE HERSELF TO DEATH UNLESS THE ARMY OWNS UP TO WHAT SHE 
SEES AS A 2 1/2-YEAR RECORD OF DECEIT. SHE INSISTS HE IS A PRISONER OF WAR AND 
HAS BEEN MERCILESSLY TORTURED.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Harvard law graduate Jennifer Harbury leaped across the widest of cultural 
divides when she married a Guatemalan guerrilla commander, a peasant who grew 
up hungry and illiterate on a coffee plantation. 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than turning into a happily-ever-after tale, it has become a 
heartbreaker: Harbury has not heard from her husband, Efrain Bamaca Velasquez, 
since March 12, 1992, when he disappeared during a firefight with a Guatemalan 
Army unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbury says he's alive, and claims to have witnesses to prove it. To press 
her case, she has begun a hunger strike in front of the National Palace in 
Guatemala, threatening to starve herself to death unless the Army owns up to 
what she sees as a 2 1/2-year record of unbroken deceit. 
</P>
<P>
 "My life and the life of my husband . . . are in the hands of the Guatemalan 
Army," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The army says it never held him. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the army had any knowledge of Bamaca, we would have handed him over," said 
Gen. Mario Enriquez, the defense minister. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed for awhile that Bamaca, 37, known by his nom de guerre, Commander 
Everardo, was yet another faceless victim of Guatemala's long and brutal civil 
war. Thirty-three years of conflict have claimed more than 100,000 lives, far 
more than any other in the hemisphere over the past half-century. 
</P>
<P>
 Guatemala has had three constitutionally elected civilian presidents since 
1986. None has been able to curb the military's pervasive influence, even 
Ramiro de Leon Carpio, who took office last year with a spotless record as a 
foe of human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 In Everardo's case, the Army maintains that it found a cadaver after the 
March, 1992, battle and buried it in a nearby town with the inscription "xxx" 
-- unidentified. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the only guerrilla member who disappeared in that battle," Harbury 
said in an interview before her recent return to Guatemala. "So it had to be 
him, logically. Who else could it be?" She grieved his loss. Since the Army had 
a history of not taking prisoners, she assumed the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 But the saga took a dramatic turn in December, 1992, when a guerrilla 
companion of Everardo named Santiago Cabrera Lopez escaped from military 
detention with news that Everardo was alive, a war prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrera said Everardo had been tortured mercilessly. All of his toenails had 
fallen out from beatings with posts. He had been hung up on a rifle rack with 
his feet tied. But he survived. A second witness said he also saw Everardo 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbury, 42, is aware that Everardo and other guerrilla prisoners spotted by 
witnesses may have been killed by now. But she won't let such uncertainties 
deter her. 
</P>
<P>
 After two years of fruitlessly bucking Guatemala's military bureaucracy for 
information, she launched her hunger strike Oct. 11. She insists that her 
husband be treated according to international law, with access to medical care, 
family members and human rights monitors. If he isn't, she said, she will 
starve herself to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Consuming only water sweetened with sugar, Harbury has been weathering wind, 
cold and torrential rains with only a thin piece of black plastic for cover. At 
night, she uses a sleeping bag. Police told her if she erected a tent, they 
would have to move her on. 
</P>
<P>
 There is hardly anything conventional about the relationship between Harbury, 
the daughter of a professor father and an artist mother, and Everardo, who, 
despairing of his bleak surroundings as a teen-ager, joined a guerrilla unit 
and became one of his country's most wanted rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 They met at the top of a volcano, of all places. Helped by guerrilla guides, 
Harbury made a six-hour, dead-of-night upward trek through the ghostly mists. 
And there at the top, protected by boulders, was the base of operations set up 
by Everardo and his companions. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbury, who was reared in Connecticut and now calls Texas home, took an 
interest during the 1980s in the hordes of desperate Central Americans, 
including Guatemalans, who fled to South Texas to escape the civil wars 
ravaging the isthmus. 
</P>
<P>
 She went to Guatemala in 1985 to document the abuses by the military and 
stayed for two years. She met Everardo after she returned to Guatemala in 1990 
to write a book about the Guatemalan revolutionary movement. They married a 
year later. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are days when they (her parents) might wish that I married an insurance 
agent," said Harbury, laughing at the thought, escaping momentarily from her 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
 She has sacrificed almost everything trying to obtain humane treatment for her 
husband. She has no job and little money. But she remains cheerful, never 
doubting that she is doing the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Her romance with Everardo is about as startling as the events since his 
disappearance. While she was an undergraduate at Cornell a generation ago, he 
was living the life of a "pack mule," hauling heavy sacks of coffee and other 
commodities in the dirt-poor southwest region of Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just remembers going out like a donkey for 13-14 hours a day and really 
being hungry for most of his life," said Harbury. He joined a local guerrilla 
movement on his 18th birthday, attracted by their emphasis on improving 
conditions for the 60% indigenous population of Guatemala. His companions 
taught him how to read and write. 
</P>
<P>
 He saw his first wife shot to death in an army ambush. His second wife was 
captured by the Army and tortured to death, Harbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a phenomenally intelligent person. It was just absolutely fascinating to 
talk to him. He didn't talk much. When he did talk, he would have something 
really thought out and interesting," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What really attracted me is that he was just a very simple person, very 
humble. And here is a commander. . . . Everyone was supposed to accept him as 
an authority figure. He wouldn't let anybody salute him." 
</P>
<P>
 Their life as a couple was brief. They lived together for a time in Mexico in 
1991 when he was a delegate to peace talks with the Guatemalan Army. They were 
in Texas together in early 1992 when he was summoned back to Guatemala during a 
difficult period for his rebel colleagues. He disappeared shortly after his 
return. 
</P>
<P>
 One attempt in 1992 at exhuming the remains of the man said to be Everardo was 
called off. In August, 1993, the remains finally were unearthed in Harbury's 
presence. She was handed a half-decomposed head and was asked in Spanish: "Is 
this your husband, Mrs. Bamaca?" She knew it was not, and her conclusion was 
confirmed by experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Among her sparse belongings as she fasts is the last letter Everardo wrote to 
her, which reads in part: 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have liked so much if you were with me and if you could have 
accompanied me to the front. . . . You do not know how much your love has 
carried me, your caring, your complete commitment during the days and moments 
we spent happily together." 
</P>
<P>
 On the third day of her hunger strike, she wrote her own letter, addressed to 
"Friends" in which she says that Guatemalans crowd around her and "are 
enormously supportive. . . . They all tell me they lost family members, and 
tell me I am speaking for thousands of others."

COMPETITIVE SWIMMER TOOK PLUNGE AT 55; AGING: NEW JERSEY WOMAN IMMERSED HERSELF 
IN SPORT; SHE NOW COMPETES AND OFTEN WINS. 'IT'S NOT WINNING THAT KEEPS ME 
GOING,' SHE SAYS. 'IT'S JUST A NEAT THING TO DO.'

 Ruth Aaron fondly recalls her first swimming lesson, about 10 years ago -- at 
age 55. 
</P>
<P>
 "A local club was having a clinic for kids over 12. I told him I was over 12 
and he said OK," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Aaron has taken on swimming full time and now competes. She often 
wins or places in regional and national races in the butterfly, freestyle, 
backstroke and breast stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Although success has fueled her interest in the sport, Aaron admits that at 
first she had a completely different motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had severe spring allergies. The only real comfort I got was when I swam, 
so I paddled around the pool a lot. Then someone suggested I start swimming 
competitively. It sort of mushroomed from there." 
</P>
<P>
 Before she took up swimming, Aaron said she was only slightly active, taking a 
bike ride or a dip in the pool at the YMCA every once in a while. 
</P>
<P>
 When she started swimming regularly 10 years ago, Aaron said, her two grown 
daughters shrugged and said, "Oh, mom's swimming." 
</P>
<P>
 "But when I told them I was going to compete, they looked at me quizzically," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband has found the transformation interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's fascinated with what's happened to me, though he's not interested in 
swimming," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as competition goes, she said, "I do very well until I get into a big 
pond like the nationals." 
</P>
<P>
 On the national level, the competition often includes former Olympic swimmers, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron swims mostly on a local circuit that includes New Jersey, Pennsylvania, 
Delaware and Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 Though she doesn't consider it her best event, Swimming Magazine ranks her 
among the top 10 swimmers in the country in the masters 200-meter butterfly -- 
a stroke she learned two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "My long-course freestyle is my best stroke," she said. "The backstroke is the 
most challenging for me. I've had trouble getting any speed on it. I still try 
to improve. That's the fun part about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Though it's a thrill to compete, she said, "It's not winning that keeps me 
going. It's just a neat thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 As her form and speed have improved, Aaron said, her life has improved as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look better, I feel better. I've built up my lungs. When I started, I could 
hardly make it to the other end of the pool, but I kept going because it helped 
my allergies." 
</P>
<P>
 For Aaron, swimming is the ideal exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing hurts and I hate to sweat, so it's perfect," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron said she believes she is setting an example for others her age to become 
more active. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find that usually people my age do what I used to do -- just paddle around. 
But watching me, they realize they could do more, that they have the strength 
to do what I do." 
</P>
<P>
 A homemaker all her life, Aaron said her hobby has become more like a new 
occupation; she reports to the pool at the YMCA about 11:15 every morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my job," she said happily.

NORWAY IS FEARSOME WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING ITS RIGHTS OF THE SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG MELLGREN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They have shelled fishing trawlers, seized the ships of anti-whaling 
activists, wrangled with oil companies, even faced down giant Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to protecting their ocean, the easygoing, diplomatic Norwegians 
can be Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwegians award the Nobel Peace Prize, sent mediators to the former 
Yugoslavia and brokered peace between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation 
Organization. They also live from the sea and fiercely protect their rights to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 To Norway, the sea means jobs, military security, recreation and half of all 
exports, mainly oil, fish and shipping. Norwegians guard their patch of it 
zealously, as everyone from Russian submariners to trawler captains have 
discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love peace, but we have to protect our rights," Ingvard Havnen, spokesman 
for the Foreign Ministry, explained after a summer of conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 This nation of 4.3 million people claims nearly 800,000 square miles of water, 
an area more than six times its own size and about one-quarter the size of the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life all along our coast has always depended on the sea," said William 
Engseth, chairman of the industry committee in Parliament. "Without it, we have 
no resources to live on." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of cold and rocky Norway is north of the Arctic Circle and only about 5% 
of its area is farmed. But the sea is rich. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its North Sea oil fields, Norway is Western Europe's largest oil 
exporter. It is a major exporter of fish and has one of the world's largest 
merchant fleets -- more than 1,000 ships. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Norwegian economy has three legs: fish, shipping and offshore oil," said 
Willy Ostreng, director of the private Fridtjof Nansen Institute in Oslo. "And 
with such a long coastline, the ocean has always been a major security 
consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 Norway, a member of NATO, constantly patrols its waters for possible 
intruders. Among those have been submarines from Russia's huge North Fleet, 
which use the waters off Norway as a corridor to the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 Such possessiveness often leads to conflict, and the Norwegians don't always 
win. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, oil companies grew tired of Norway's stiff taxes and demands for 
at least half of all oil produced. They threatened to slow, or even halt, 
development of new fields. 
</P>
<P>
 With oil production in current fields expected to dwindle after the year 2000, 
Norway took the threat to heart. Jens Stoltenberg, minister of industry and 
energy, promised to review the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Norway was less understanding about whale-hunting, resuming its commercial 
hunt of minke whales in 1993 and setting off what newspapers called a "whale 
war" with environmentalists. In resuming the hunt after six years, the 
government exercised its right as a member of the International Whaling 
Commission to reject the commission's 1986 ban on commercial hunting. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwegian commercial whalers killed 206 minkes last summer. When 
environmentalists sailed in, determined to stop the hunt, the coast guard was 
waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 A ship operated by the militant Sea Shepherd group rammed a coast guard cutter 
in June, but got away. In July, the coast guard boarded and seized two 
Greenpeace ships. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwegian authorities stood their ground and the whale hunt was completed, but 
no sooner had the whalers returned to shore than a "cod war" began with 
Iceland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Icelanders, desperate for fish to replace their own depleted stocks, in 
August sent an armada of fishing trawlers to disputed waters inside the 
200-mile commercial zone Norway declared around its Arctic Svalbard 
Archipelago. 
</P>
<P>
 Norway responded with gunboats. The coast guard fired on an Icelandic trawler, 
claiming one of its crewmen fired first. No one was injured. The trawler was 
boarded and sailed to shore with two holes in its stern.

RABBI SHLOMO CARLEBACH; SINGER, COMPOSER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach, 69, the world-famous "singing rabbi" who performed on 
30 albums of Hasidic music. He rose to fame three decades ago as a storyteller, 
singer and composer of melodies known as "negunim" that became standards at 
Jewish services and weddings.Carlebach took over Congregation Kehilath Jacob in 
Manhattan in 1967 after the death of his father, Rabbi Naphtall Carlebach. The 
musical rabbi composed thousands of melodies that blended traditional Hasidic 
folk music with contemporary styles. He gave concerts in the United States, 
South America, Europe and Israel, where he spent several months a year. 
Carlebach was welcome even in areas with few Jewish residents because, an 
associate explained, "his spiritual message parallels many New Age ideas." On 
Oct. 20 of a heart attack, while en route from England to New York.

GEORGE GAY JR.; SURVIVED BATTLE OF MIDWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Gay Jr., 77, who became a national hero as the only aviator of his 
30-man squadron to survive the Battle of Midway in World War II. Gay, of 
Marietta, Ga., earned his place in history by bobbing up and down in the ocean 
for 30 hours as the battle that became the turning point of the war in the 
Pacific raged around him on June 4, 1942.Wounded, and wearing a life jacket, 
Gay said he was "cheering and hollering with every hit." Gay later became a 
spokesman for Admiral Chester Nimitz in telling the story of the U.S. victory 
at Midway, even appearing on the cover of Life magazine. Gay had asked that his 
ashes be scattered over the Midway battle site so that he can rest with his 
"buddies." On Oct. 21 in Atlanta of a heart attack.

SHLOMO GOREN; FOUGHT ISRAELI-PLO ACCORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shlomo Goren, 77, a former chief rabbi of Israel and an outspoken critic of 
Israeli reconciliation with the PLO. Goren, who served as Israel's chief rabbi 
from 1973 to 1983, was often at the center of controversy.A year ago, he issued 
a religious ruling that soldiers could refuse orders to dismantle Jewish 
settlements in the occupied West Bank. "There is a law that overrides all 
others, and that is the law of settling Israel," Goren said at the time. 
Goren's call for disobedience was given special weight because he served as 
chief military chaplain during the 1967 Middle East war, reaching the rank of 
brigadier general. Shortly after the September, 1993 Israel-PLO accord on 
autonomy, Goren said that every Jew was commanded to kill PLO chief Yasser 
Arafat. In the 1967 war, Goren accompanied the Israeli troops that captured 
Arab East Jerusalem, including the Western Wall in the walled Old City. When 
the soldiers reached the wall, Judaism's holiest site, Goren blew a shofar, or 
ram's horn, in joy. In Jerusalem on Saturday of a heart attack.

EQUAL RIGHTS AN EMPTY PROMISE FOR SOUTH AFRICAN WOMEN, BLACK OR WHITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAISLEY DODDS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fading scars on Anu Pillay's body are signs of the 11 years her husband 
habitually beat and raped her. Inside, the hidden trauma heals more slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 She remembers police officers who were sent to investigate the abuse sitting 
down to drink with her husband. She remembers hospital staffers releasing her 
into his custody even though his beatings -- once splitting the back of her 
head open with an iron pipe -- put her there in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a state of confusion in South African culture regarding abusive 
behavior," said Pillay, 35, who is now divorced and counsels abused women. "No 
one understands that it is wrong because it is so pervasive." 
</P>
<P>
 President Nelson Mandela campaigned on a promise of equal rights and a better 
life for all. But South African women still face laws and attitudes that in 
many ways relegate them to second-class citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a new constitution and bill of rights guaranteeing full rights for 
women took effect with the first all-race election in April, social attitudes 
spawned from male-dominated cultures -- white and black -- still prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have seen democracy spread throughout the government, but we haven't seen 
democracy go through the house, through the kitchen and into the bedroom," said 
Gille De Vlieg of the Black Sash, a human rights group formed by women. 
</P>
<P>
 Women account for more than half of South Africa's 40 million people. They 
hold only two of the 28 positions on Mandela's Cabinet and about one-quarter of 
the seats in the new Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 In day-to-day life, stark discrimination and disparities exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Standard Bank, one of South Africa's largest, this year stopped requiring 
women to get husbands' permission to open their own checking accounts. Despite 
the change, four Standard Bank tellers recently told an Associated Press 
reporter she would need her husband's signature to open an account. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a woman, you are treated as a minor -- as a person who is incapable of 
having dreams and making decisions," said Jean Ngubane of the Women's National 
Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence against women -- rapes, assaults, battering -- occurs often, 
activists say. Researchers at the group People Opposed to Women Abuse estimate 
that one of every six women will be physically abused. 
</P>
<P>
 South African police say more than 27,000 rapes were reported last year. That 
is about 1 1/2 times the rate in the United States, where nearly 105,000 rapes 
were reported for a population six times that of South Africa's. 
</P>
<P>
 The Women's National Coalition estimates only 5% of rape victims report the 
crime. It says South African courts have historically treated rape and domestic 
abuse as private matters, dismissing cases or suspending sentences 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Siza Koomba, who works at the nation's largest black daily newspaper, said her 
complaints of regular sexual harassment -- lewd comments, unwanted touches -- 
go unanswered by male supervisors, sometimes drawing bursts of laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men here don't think that you have a right to complain," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Abuse is a problem in all racial groups, activists say. But it is particularly 
bad for black women, who remain tied to tribal customs and traditions that 
leave them powerless in their homes and lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional tribal laws minimize penalties for domestic abuse. White courts 
often defer to tribal law on family matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women's lives are affected by culture, and sexism is endemic to black African 
culture," said Thuli Madonsela of the Center for Applied Legal Studies, a human 
rights research group. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinah Themba recalled her parents arranging her marriage 20 years ago to a 
husband she had never seen for the going price at the time -- one cow, three 
goats and 500 rand ($145). Similar practices continue today, she said.

GRACE AND FEAR MARK AIDS EPIDEMIC IN SAN FRANCISCO; HEALTH: DISEASE IS NOW THE

 Richard has seen it countless times -- the anger, the sorrow, the bravery of 
critically ill AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, he says, he'll know exactly how they feel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not everybody is courageous in the face of AIDS. Some go kicking and 
screaming and are horrible to everyone around them," said the former heroin 
addict-turned AIDS counselor. "I'm not sure how I'm going to act." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard, who declined to use his last name, was diagnosed HIV positive in 
1985. "So I'm panicking." 
</P>
<P>
 He isn't the only one. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco health department recently announced that for the first time 
in any U.S. city, AIDS was the leading cause of death among men in 1992 -- the 
first time any illness passed heart disease as the No. 1 killer. 
</P>
<P>
 In a tragic coincidence, 1992 was the same year health officials celebrated 
hitting a plateau in the number of new cases. 
</P>
<P>
 What's even more unfortunate is that many here weren't surprised by the 
numbers. "We've lost so many friends," said Richard Chavez, former program 
coordinator for activities at the Shanti Project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frightening to think that nobody is surprised by it," said Chavez, who 
is also HIV-positive. "Maybe some people who have been hiding in the sand might 
say, 'Oh, my gosh.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last few years, AIDS has been the leading cause of death among men 
age 25-44, but 1992 was the first time it crossed all age lines. The largest 
increase in deaths came in men age 35-44. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the latest year data is available, of the 8,143 total deaths in San 
Francisco, 1,195 men died of AIDS, while 1,094 men died of heart-related 
disease. In 1991, of the total 8,345 deaths, heart-related disease killed 1,189 
men and AIDS killed 1,152 men.

 "In traditional medicine, you go to the doctor and get better. In AIDS, you go 
to the doctor, you go to the doctor, you go to the doctor, you go to the 
doctor, you go to the doctor, you go to the doctor -- and die," said Richard, 
the AIDS counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 Among all San Francisco residents, AIDS accounted for 15% of the deaths in 
1992 and 14% in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of new AIDS cases reported in 1992 was 3,028, but that dropped 25% 
to 2,264 in 1993. The health department estimated that new cases would drop to 
1,204 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 "AIDS had been inching up as the leading cause of death. . . . It didn't go 
from being No. 12 to 1 overnight," said Mitch Katz, director of the city's AIDS 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Between 1981 and 1984, there were 8,000 new infections each year. Those were 
entirely among gay men. And now we're seeing, 10 to 12 years later, the 
consequences -- the high rate of death," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the numbers for 1993 are still being compiled, AIDS is expected to 
remain the leading cause of death. The death rate isn't likely to decrease 
until the late 1990s, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The health department warned that although the number of AIDS cases among gay 
men has decreased, the numbers of youths and intravenous drug users afflicted 
is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard, the AIDS counselor, doesn't doubt that AIDS will increase among IV 
drug users. 
</P>
<P>
 The "shooting galleries," or drug homes, where he used to hang out had three 
hypodermic needles on the table for about eight people. Some had been used so 
many times the tips were rounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some days, I never saw a person above the forearm," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was sober on and off and went through some years of shooting up a few times 
a year, compared with 10 to 15 times a day. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, his girlfriend threatened to dump him if he got stoned. When he 
did it anyway, he lied to her, saying his friend had just died of AIDS and he 
couldn't handle the emotional strain. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman then suggested they get tested. In 1985, he got a phone call from a 
clinic doctor who said she tested negative. 
</P>
<P>
 His test was positive. 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS is "part of what put me in touch . . . made me part of the human race 
again," Richard said. "I've spent so much of my life numb and unfeeling. To be 
feeling is a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard has been clean for the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most productive time in my life, from the standpoint of being a 
part of rather than apart from," he said, though he wishes his wake-up call had 
been something other than AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I get incredibly teary sometimes when I think about what it would be 
like. I don't want to wear a diaper because I'm incontinent when I'm 41. That's 
the stuff that's supposed to happen to you when you're 85 or 90," Richard said. 
</P>
<P>
 But his spirits rise when he thinks of his work as a counselor, his girlfriend 
and starting graduate school in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I didn't get HIV, if I didn't get tested, I wouldn't be here today. And 
I'm supposed to be here and putting one foot in front of the other." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Fritz Desir doesn't know how he got AIDS. What he does know is that he can no 
longer play soccer. He worries about how he's going to pay rent and buy food. 
</P>
<P>
 Desir, 31, escaped from Haiti in 1980 and spent three months drifting at sea 
with 30 others before being picked up by the U.S. Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 He eventually received political asylum and was sent to San Francisco. In 
1992, after suffering a bout with tuberculosis, he found out he was HIV 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, his energy level -- and his spirits -- are low. "I can't pay my 
rent. I can't go out and have a good time," Desir said, sitting in his cramped 
San Francisco studio. 
</P>
<P>
 "She helps me," he said, meaning his girlfriend, Catherine Crawford. "But I 
can't help her like I used to." 
</P>
<P>
 The two share the studio. But both are unemployed; after paying rent, they 
have $100 left. Recently, a friend staying with them promised to help pay the 
rent. The friend skipped town. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just take every battle as it comes," Desir said. "My life is in God's 
hands." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Robert Sterman and Glenn Nelson met via a computer bulletin board. Both knew 
the other was HIV positive, but that didn't matter. Their only fear was that 
they would get sick at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson's health started deteriorating first, about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 So they decided to get married. Though California doesn't recognize same-sex 
marriages, the pair exchanged vows at a ceremony before a small gathering of 
friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
 "We both said, when we said our vows, 'till death do us part.' And that's 
exactly what we meant," Sterman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson died earlier this year. He was 28. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my concerns is people seeing the story and saying, 'Oh, there's 
another gay that died.' He was a person, " Sterman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sterman recently began feeling the effects of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 He stays at home more now, because he's afraid he won't have the energy to 
climb the flight of stairs to his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole world seems to be moving at a much, much faster pace than me. That 
gets to be frustrating when you know you used to be at that faster pace." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he plans life by the week. And he clings to a little ray of hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's hope that they will be able to find a way to control the disease," he 
said. "And the hope that at least your journey into whatever the next life is, 
is as easy as it can be."

DANA PARSONS: IT WAS FAIR GAME UNTIL THE LOVE AFFAIR TURNED FOWL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Say, we really had them going, didn't we? Those chumps. We really convinced 
them we cared about them. Did they really take all that lovey-dovey talk 
seriously? Talk about gullible, sheesh. It's not like we'd never heard a 
come-on before. What do they think we are, stupid? 
</P>
<P>
 (Pause for hysterical sobbing and pounding of fists on tabletop.) 
</P>
<P>
 Who are we kidding? We've been nailed again, played for suckers. 
</P>
<P>
 WHY DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING? 
</P>
<P>
 This was supposed to be hockey season, remember? This was supposed to be the 
second year of our love affair with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, and who 
doubted that our relationship wouldn't grow stronger? 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks waddled into our hearts and minds last year, and we couldn't resist 
them. They were virgins, they told us they were ours for the asking, and we 
fell like a ton of bricks. Part of their appeal was that all the smart-alecks 
figured they would be laughingstocks, that nobody could love anyone that dopey 
and inexperienced. Silly uniforms, silly logos, silly name -- ragamuffins on 
skates. And what were they calling home? Some place called The Pond ? Hockey 
purists cringed. The Montreals and Torontos of the hockey world scoffed at our 
Ducks, which only made us love them more. 
</P>
<P>
 True, we were hungry for love. A lot of that had to do with our misbegotten 
affair with that other team, the Rams. Talk about faithless lovers. Once, we 
lavished money on them, too, thinking that would make them love us. How 
foolish. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did they take our money and throw it away, they rubbed our noses in 
it by openly courting other suitors. We may be love-starved, but do they think 
we have no pride left? Do they think they can sleep in our bed by night while 
publicly cavorting by day with the Baltimores and St. Louises of the world? 
This is their idea of love? 
</P>
<P>
 We knew the Ducks were different. They were proud to call themselves Anaheim. 
And even though they raised ticket prices on us, they at least went out and got 
a potential superstar in that young Kariya fellow to show us they were serious. 
</P>
<P>
 We saw they were different from those Rams, and we spilled our hearts and then 
backed it up by spilling our wallets. We spared no expense, even though the 
Ducks were no cheap date. We went to their games, paid their parking fees, and 
bought their duck-billed hats. Before we knew it, we realized that, gulp, we 
loved them. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics said we wouldn't commit -- that we couldn't commit -- that we were 
too sophisticated for a serious relationship, but we proved them wrong. By the 
end of last season, in April, our affection was the talk of the league. It 
produced attendance that was 98.9% of season-long capacity. The last 25 games 
at The Pond were sellouts, and every night was a party. We cheered our fool 
heads off, and reveled as we called out our heroes' names: Yake, Semenov, 
Ladouceur, Fedotov, Shtalenkov. Oh, who cared if we couldn't pronounce them? 
With each rapturous cheer, our Ducks responded with verve and valor, even if 
sometimes forgetting that our joy would have been even greater had they 
remembered to occasionally slide that black thing into the other team's net. 
</P>
<P>
 So what if they weren't perfect? They were ours, the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim! 
and everything clicked so beautifully between us that we happily overlooked 
their shortcomings. They were huggable, and we hugged them tight. 
</P>
<P>
 And now . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Something has gone horribly wrong. Was it something we said? We drive past The 
Pond and feel nothing but an aching heart and hear nothing from the freeway but 
echoes of our own distant laughter. Coming closer, we hear muted shouts from 
inside The Pond, but now they're coming from a Kenny G concert instead of from 
a Maple Leaf being pounded into the boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing but memories. We're trying hard to avoid thinking we've been taken -- 
again -- but that's what it feels like, doesn't it? What does it mean now that 
the Ducks set a record for the most wins by a first-year team? What does it 
mean that they beat the Stanley Cup champs not once, but twice? 
</P>
<P>
 Do they think they did all that without us? 
</P>
<P>
 They say it's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all, 
but whoever said that never cheered for the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. They never 
saw the Decoys in action or blew their duck calls with all their might into the 
ear of an unsuspecting fan sitting next to them. They weren't there that night 
last March when the Ducks beat the Los Angeles Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, what's the use. We're all grown-ups here. We've been hurt before and 
probably will be again. 
</P>
<P>
 But, dammit, do we really deserve this?

SCOTT HARRIS: GETTING THE TRUTH IS ALWAYS GOOD NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson got me invited to USC the other day. It wasn't O.J., the man, but 
O.J., the Story of the Century. The occasion was a "business-in-society" 
seminar for high school seniors staged by a group called the Constitutional 
Rights Foundation. They wanted somebody to talk about "media hype." It was my 
job to do some more tsk-tsking over the obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 In this Super Bowl of media events, journalism has been flagged more than the 
Raiders. I reminded students of just a few of the fouls. For style, there's the 
infamous Time magazine cover that darkened Simpson's police mug. For substance, 
well, has anyone found that "ski mask" yet? 
</P>
<P>
 But students from the Antelope Valley to the South Bay didn't need specifics 
to rip the catchall that is "the media." A student named Julie told me she is 
so disgusted that she avoids all the news, all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, that's so cynical," I chided. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growing up in L. A.," Julie responded, "made me cynical." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What do you say to that? The attitude is understandable. Many of L. A.'s jaded 
teen-agers can remember when this city showed its best face to the world. Ten 
years ago, they were children who witnessed the glorious celebration of 1984 
Los Angeles Olympics with awe and wonder. That's true even if they only saw it 
through the TV, the magazines, the newspaper -- "the media." But since then, 
they've seen L. A. at its worst, culminating in the 1992 riots. The calamities 
of fire and earthquakes probably didn't help anybody's attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 So if I had the chance to talk to Julie again, what would I say? Perhaps this: 
Lighten up. Things aren't as bad as they seem. If you can suspend your cynicism 
long enough to look at the front page, you'll find some good news, and there is 
even some evidence that the big, bad media are doing some good. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm writing this on a Friday for Sunday, so I have no idea what appears on 
today's front page. But in recent days, the big story from overseas is the 
Mideast peace accords, be they ever so fragile. Meanwhile, democracy has been 
restored to Haiti. The terrorists of Hamas and Gen. Cedras may disagree, but 
this strikes most people as good news. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, much closer to home, the Nov. 8 ballot has managed to overshadow O. 
J. No matter how you stand on the candidates or the initiatives, it's 
reassuring that the democratic process, warts and all, has succeeded, at least 
temporarily, in putting the O. J. saga in a more appropriate perspective. (It 
helps, of course, that jury selection isn't as exciting as the actual trial.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The media" helped do that. And let's not forget the good news about Mike 
Huffington -- the revelation that this man hired an illegal immigrant to care 
for his children. 
</P>
<P>
 This is good news -- whether you are Republican or Democrat, whether you love 
Huffington or loathe him. This is good news regardless of your opinions about 
immigration policy. This is good news if, like Huffington, you support 
Proposition 187 and therefore wish to deny public health care and education 
benefits to illegal immigrants and their children. And it's good news if you 
don't. 
</P>
<P>
 It's good news simply because it's the truth. It's not a half-truth, and it's 
not a matter of interpretation. It's a cold, hard fact. Or perhaps a warm, soft 
fact, since the Huffingtons -- or at least Arianna and the children -- are 
obviously very fond of this woman named Marisela, and she is apparently fond of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Mike Huffington himself should understand that it's good that the truth 
came out, and judging by his recent confession, he does. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made a mistake, there is no question about it," he said. But, "who 
among us has not broken the law? Who among us has not gone past 55 miles an 
hour? . . . We are all human . . . and if we make a mistake . . . we should own 
up to it. Which I have done and Arianna has done." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. Let he who is without sin cast the first stone. We are all human -- 
even those illegal immigrants who care for our children. And yes, we should own 
up to our "mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it's better for politicians to own up to mistakes in a timely 
fashion, rather than to have them revealed by the Los Angeles Times. Huffington 
could have divulged this fact when he announced his support for Proposition 
187, the anti-illegal immigration measure. Instead, he tried to hide it, right 
up to the very end. Sometimes, cover-ups work. But sometimes, as the saying 
goes, the truth will out. Surely the candidate is familiar with the words of 
Jesus: "And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike, it was good to get to know you, to finally fill in the empty suit in 
"Doonesbury." It seems like only yesterday that you introduced yourself to us 
in a television commercial touting "The Book of Virtues." You said it's a fine, 
important book, and you urged us all to read it. You knew that skeptics would 
find you a bit pious. But you also knew that a lot of us pray for more virtue 
in this world. 
</P>
<P>
 These truths are self-evident: Honesty is better than hypocrisy, and courage 
is better than craven opportunism. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, "courage," of course, is a slippery word in politics. Gov. Wilson's ads 
say he has "courage" for supporting Proposition 187, even though it leads in 
the polls and is supported by his party. The word seems more appropriate in 
describing other various Republican leaders. One of them is William F. Bennett, 
the former secretary of education. He's also the author of "The Book of 
Virtues." 
</P>
<P>
 So, Julie, if you're out there, I hope you don't read this story and simply 
think Mike Huffington is another reason to be discouraged. That he may be, but 
isn't it better to know that now? 
</P>
<P>
 The point is, if you don't keep up with the news, you'll miss the good stuff 
too.

FOR POLITICIAN WHO CONCOCTED A TALE OF HEROISM, THE END BEGAN ON TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VERN ANDERSON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Look closely at the 40-year-old tape of U.S. Rep. Douglas Stringfellow's 
appearance on the TV program "This Is Your Life," and you will see the look of 
a trapped animal in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Watch as his exploits as an OSS spy in World War II are extolled, as his 
friends and family are introduced by the ever-smiling host, Ralph Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that moment I would have bartered my life to have prevented the telecast," 
Stringfellow later wrote. "Outwardly calm, I was shaken to my very depths 
within. Somehow I sensed this was the beginning of the end." 
</P>
<P>
 It was. Nine months later, in October, 1954, his war record was exposed as a 
hoax and his promising political career ended in disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
 But at that moment, on national television, Stringfellow considered giving up 
the charade he had lived since war's end. He just couldn't do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to get out the best way that I could -- without splashing all over my 
family and friends," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 How had one of the brightest young stars in the Republican firmament managed 
to turn his life into a lie, one he couldn't even share with the wife and soul 
mate he called "Funny Face"? 
</P>
<P>
 His never-published autobiography, obtained from family members who remember 
him with love, offers some clues. 
</P>
<P>
 Stringfellow was shipped home to Utah from France in January, 1945. A lowly 
infantryman, overseas barely two weeks, he had been part of a mine-clearing 
detail when shrapnel from an explosion slammed into the base of his spine. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedridden with lifeless legs, utterly depressed by his meaningless role in the 
toppling of Nazi Germany, Stringfellow sought solace in flights of fancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without a past to recall, a future to plan and build for, I fled each night 
to that world of fantasy where time and space did not exist. I roamed the 
battlefields of the world, conquering the enemy and restoring peace to a 
war-torn Earth. Thus, psychologists do not think it so strange that I awoke one 
morning consciously remembering my dramatic but imaginary part in a war that 
was all too real." 
</P>
<P>
 Word of Stringfellow's imagined exploits spread among fellow veterans, friends 
and family in his first days at Bushnell General Hospital in Brigham City. The 
tales already were common currency when Shirley Mae Lemmon, known to friends as 
Lee, danced for the Bushnell convalescents on Stringfellow's 23rd birthday. 
They were married 10 months later in the Mormon Church's Salt Lake Temple. 
</P>
<P>
 A naturally gifted public speaker, Stringfellow, standing with canes and leg 
braces, held audiences in thrall with his detailed accounts of wartime 
derring-do. A 1946 stint as state chairman for the Young Republicans opened a 
shining path to politics even as he embarked on a promising career in radio. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1950, the Freedom Foundation picked Stringfellow third, behind Gen. Dwight 
D. Eisenhower and former President Herbert Hoover, for noteworthy public 
speaking. Two years later, voters in Utah's 1st Congressional District sent him 
to Congress in a Republican landslide. 
</P>
<P>
 Although just 30, demand for his spellbinding speeches brought him 200 
engagements a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in the summer of 1953, Stringfellow admitted to himself he must have 
imagined his heroism: He had not parachuted into Germany on a secret mission, 
had not kidnaped German nuclear physicist Otto Haun, and had not been caught 
and tortured by the Gestapo at the Belsen concentration camp before escaping to 
tell the story. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 14, 1954, the Army Times broke the story that Stringfellow had made it 
all up. Lee Stringfellow learned the truth only hours before it was front-page

 Two days later, under intense pressure from Mormon Church and Republican 
leaders, Stringfellow made a tearful television appearance, admitting the hoax

 Party leaders agreed, and his political career was over.

 Virtually unemployable in Utah, Stringfellow stayed home while his wife worked

ARTIST FOCUSES ON THE ELDERLY'S HERITAGE; PIONEERS: JIM BRANSCUM HOPES TO 
ILLUSTRATE THAT THE ELDERLY ARE IMPORTANT. 'SOCIETY JUDGES VALUE BY WHAT PEOPLE 
CAN PRODUCE TODAY, BUT JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE HAS REACHED A CERTAIN AGE DOES NOT 
MEAN THEIR VALUE HAS DIMINISHED,' HE SAYS.

 When artist Jim Branscum interviews a potential model, he's looking for more 
than just a pretty face. 
</P>
<P>
 Branscum has begun a series of pencil drawings of what he calls "the pioneers 
of this country" to help Americans recognize the contributions of the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 After crisscrossing the nation, visiting 33 states and interviewing 100 people 
for "Aging in America: Our Heritage of Wisdom," Branscum has chosen 22 models. 
Most are over 85 and live in long-term-care nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Older people in long-term care are simply dismissed. If I can get people to 
recognize the benefits of these people, then I have accomplished what I set out 
to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Branscum's subjects range from the oldest living female Marine to the designer 
of pumps for the Alaskan pipeline. One was an American soldier who fought in 
World War I. Another remembers seeing the Wright brothers prior to their first 
flight at Kitty Hawk, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Marie Hills, 85, of Detroit said it was an unexpected pleasure to pose 
for the artist. A teacher, she worked in engineering at a Ford plant during 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came into the nursing home and I was chosen to pose for him. The people . 
. . said there are better-looking women around here, but he chose me, and now 
the picture is hanging on the wall in the big dining room." 
</P>
<P>
 Branscum, 49, will draw 14 additional models to complete the project. He wants 
to capture a cross-section of America's elderly by representing as many ethnic, 
racial and religious groups in 36 drawings as he can. 
</P>
<P>
 "Society judges value by what people can produce today, but just because 
someone has reached a certain age does not mean their value has diminished," 
Branscum said. "They deserve honor and support in times of need. We don't have 
a right to ignore this." 
</P>
<P>
 The origin of the project was a "twist of fate," Branscum said. In 1991, a 
visitor to Branscum's art gallery in Scottsdale got in touch with a friend who 
ran a nursing home in Detroit. He made the call because the owner of the 
nursing home was also named Jim Branscum. 
</P>
<P>
 After a series of calls, the two met and Jim Branscum, the nursing home 
administrator, asked Jim Branscum, the artist, to produce three original 
drawings depicting the humanity and dignity of America's aging population. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started, I had no idea of the scope of the project," Branscum 
said. Now he has 12 sponsors and plans a two-year exhibition of his "Aging in 
America" drawings when the series is complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Branscum, who also is a sculptor, compares his work on the project to work he 
did on a Korean War Memorial in Phoenix almost a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project is really the same thing. These (elderly) people have given 
their lives. In fact, they've given more than any of us in supporting this 
country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Subjects like Valitin Sokoloff, a 92-year-old San Mateo, Calif., resident, 
exemplify the varied background Branscum is seeking. 
</P>
<P>
 Sokoloff was born the son of a Russian infantry officer while the Bolshevik 
Revolution was raging. As the Bolsheviks took power, he was able to escape and 
settle in China. After 28 years in that country, he and 6,000 other Russian 
immigrants were exiled by Mao Tse Tung to the Philippines. In 1951, at age 49, 
he obtained a visa to America. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have lived in three wonderful countries and had three wonderful families 
that I loved," Sokoloff told Branscum. "I have never had to shoot anyone and no 
one has shot at me. I swam through my troubles like a fish and they never 
touched me." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Heard, 102, of Mexia, Tex., was the first man in his community to 
drive an automobile. One of his proudest accomplishments was opening a barbecue 
restaurant that now houses the local headquarters of the NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt honored to be a part of a worthwhile project," Heard said. "The 
elderly have a lot to teach the younger generation, and I hope my participation 
helped toward that goal of greater awareness."

TAKE A TEXAS Y'ALL, AN HOMBRE OF EAST L.A., UN POCO OF SPANISH: IT'S TEJANO ; 
LINGUISTICS: FROM EAST TO WEST, NORTH TO SOUTH, MOTHER TONGUES ARE GETTING 
STIRRED TOGETHER FOR EVERYDAY USE BY THE NATION'S FAST-GROWING HISPANIC 
POPULATION.

 It's not strict English. Ni puro espanol.  
</P>
<P>
 No, what's spoken here along la frontera is a mixture -- sometimes logical, 
sometimes goofy -- of two languages and two cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our parents speak English and our grandparents hablan espanol, " says "Rock 
'n' Roll" James Echavarria, a disc jockey on bilingual radio station KIWW. 
</P>
<P>
 Rock 'n' Roll James hits the airwaves with a rapid-fire delivery -- and no 
pauses between English and Spanish: 
</P>
<P>
 "KIWW 96, the Valley's choice for hot tejano hits. Rock 'n' Roll James 
acompanandoles, faltan como veinte y dos minutos para las dos de la tarde. And 
right now, we've got some more jams. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 From Queens to East Los Angeles, Miami to Detroit, Houston to Chicago and 
thousands of places in between, Spanish and English are getting stirred 
together in the everyday parlance of many among the nation's fast-growing 
Hispanic population. 
</P>
<P>
 And as Rock 'n' Roll James will tell you, it's become a hybrid dialect -- and 
a marketing tool -- here on the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned all of this by ear because I never really took Spanish class or 
anything like that," said the longhaired 27-year-old, who, despite his moniker, 
plays tejano music -- a mixture of Mexican ranchera and polka, with pop, 
country and Cuban influences thrown in -- instead of rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of slang, tejano slang." 
</P>
<P>
 After switching to a 60% English, 40% Spanish format featuring the popular 
tejano sound two years ago, KIWW jumped to No. 1 in the Lower Rio Grande Valley 
and remains one of the top stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're actually developing a new language," Rock 'n' Roll James said. 
</P>
<P>
 He calls it tejano. Others call it Spanglish, or Tex-Mex. Some English-only 
advocates might call it a threat. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike supporters of the Parti Quebecois, seeking to create a separatist 
French-speaking nation in eastern Canada, many Spanish speakers in the United 
States don't debate which language to speak. Instead, they're mixing both. 
</P>
<P>
 Linguists call it "code switching," and they say it's natural when people grow 
up with two languages. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's done unconsciously," said Lucy Garcia Willis, head of the modern 
language department at the University of Texas-Brownsville. "It gets the point 
across. Some people will frown on it. But it's a cultural thing. It's probably 
gaining more and more acceptance." 
</P>
<P>
 With proper grammar taking a back seat to convenience, some educators worry 
that generations of Hispanics are growing up without knowing either language 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mark Glazer, an anthropologist at the University of Texas-Pan American, 
views it as a long-term movement toward English. Glazer adds that English 
itself formed in a mixture, with strong influence from French and Germanic 
languages. 
</P>
<P>
 And it works both ways. English phrases are increasingly slipping into the 
Spanish and Portuguese spoken in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Willis believes people should learn the proper grammar of both 
languages, she says there's often a grammatical logic behind many 
code-switching phrases. 
</P>
<P>
 A Mexican-American mother, for example, might tell her daughter to put on her 
red shoes: "Ponte los red shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 The mother may know the Spanish words for red shoes (zapatos rojos or zapatos 
colorados), but it's easier to use the English ones. And yet the mother says 
"los" red shoes instead of "las" red shoes because zapatos -- the Spanish word 
for shoes -- is masculine, not feminine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some will consider it totally butchering the language, but keep in mind the 
tendency of modern society for efficiency, saying things in as few words as 
possible," Willis said. 
</P>
<P>
 So the verb "to type" (escribir a maquina) becomes "taipiar, " which doesn't 
exist in real Spanish. Windshield wipers (limpiaparabrisas) become "los 
winshi-waiper." "Give me a ride" becomes "Dame un ride." "I go on break at 
10:30" becomes "Tengo el break a las 10:30." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Zavaleta, a UT Brownsville anthropologist who studies the border, says 
true code-switching -- with no interruption in thought -- takes more than 
simply knowing both languages. It's the result of living in an environment like 
the Texas-Mexico border, where Spanish and English have meshed since the 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a cultural foundation, and sense of ownership and place, to facilitate a 
person to switch off languages," Zavaleta said. "As we go through the 
construction of a sentence at the speed of light, our minds are picking up two 
vocabularies -- a vocabulary in English and a vocabulary in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "English is better for describing science. Spanish is better for describing 
emotion." 
</P>
<P>
 And while phrases like "hasta la bye-bye" may be taking things to a 
nonsensical extreme, people don't carry grammar books with them when they sit 
down to eat fajitas and french fries. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all, it's not a matter of language," Zavaleta said. "It's a matter of 
communication."

 Nancy Reagan rocked North's Senate campaign by telling an audience in

NOT EVERYONE ADORES THE RABBITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The article "Senior Citizens Decry Poisoning of Rabbits," (Oct. 20) makes it 
sound as if most of the Leisure World residents are in favor of the cottontail 
rabbits that infest our community. 
</P>
<P>
 However, 300 petitions represent less than 2% of our population.It's another 
example of the vocal minority getting all the attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Several months ago we were literally overrun by rabbits. On one particular 
lawn you could count four of them every evening. There were another three 
around and about my house. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mornings I had to gingerly step through and around their overnight 
droppings to pick up my copy of The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 As an environmentally correct solution, I obtained Leisure World gate passes 
for two coyotes who appear to be correcting the problem by providing the 
necessary ecological balance.

MOULTON PATTERSON IS PICK FOR SUPERVISOR; LEADERSHIP STYLE AND APPROACH TO 
LOCAL ISSUES MAKE CHOICE CLEAR IN NONPARTISAN RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The best-kept secret in the runoff race for a seat on the Board of Supervisors 
in the 2nd District this fall is that this is a nonpartisan political office.  
</P>
<P>
 The political barbs have been flying for much of this year. A host of local 
Republican leaders backed Jim Silva. Linda Moulton Patterson has support from 
unions, Democratic leaders and some notable Republicans, such as Santa Ana 
Mayor Daniel H. Young. In September, a contentious debate saw Silva accusing 
Moulton Patterson of being a "Clinton liberal," and Moulton Patterson 
suggesting that Silva was beholden to Supervisor Roger R. Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 The political wrangling was reduced at one point to a battle over who was more 
authentically in support of Proposition 187, the initiative that would deny 
public school education and social services to illegal immigrants.  
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere beyond this political fog lie more pragmatic considerations. The 
question that must be answered by voters in the district, which covers 
northwest county cities, including Huntington Beach, Seal Beach, Costa Mesa and 
Cypress, is which of these two will be the best supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Republicans in heavily Republican Orange County may be put off simply by 
Moulton Patterson's Democratic Party affiliation. But this indeed is a 
nonpartisan race and should be judged on the approaches to local issues, and on 
style of leadership. And on those terms, we continue to believe that Moulton 
Patterson is the clear choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters would be best advised to look at Moulton Patterson's evenhanded record 
of service to the city of Huntington Beach as local school board president, 
mayor and member of the California Coastal Commission. In these roles, she has 
been in step with the concerns and needs of her constituents. She has served 
with distinction. 
</P>
<P>
 Her opposition to the knee-jerk planning by ballot box that is represented in 
the airport initiative now before the voters is a case in point. She has 
preferred less dense development of the Bolsa Chica wetlands than her opponent. 
She offers independent and balanced judgment, and would be a welcome complement 
to the Board of Supervisors to join along with the new incoming supervisor 
Marian Bergeson.

PARENTS' OPINIONS ARE HIGHLY VALUED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am a candidate for the Huntington Beach Union High School District Governing 
Board. An article "PTA Surveys Candidates in 22 School District Races (Oct. 
24)," misquoted me in a particularly serious way.The misquote, in the context 
it was presented, leads the reader to think that I have chosen a childless 
lifestyle, don't respect parental opinions, and may have some hidden agenda for 
running for school board. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this is true. In fact, the indirect quote is the exact opposite of my 
stated situation. That is, I am childless through circumstances beyond my 
control -- not my choice. 
</P>
<P>
 This quote was in response to a bluntly phrased question: What schools do your 
children attend, or did they attend if they are out of school? Anyone who knows 
me, knows that my status as a single person is a great regret in my life. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, parental involvement in the schools system in one of my campaign 
issues. I am in favor of much more respect for parents than we currently have. 
</P>
<P>
 My answer, when read in its entirety, states that I believe parental 
involvement "is highly desired at all levels" within the system, but I also 
believe that the broader community needs and deserves a voice.

THE HARD-LEARNED LESSONS OF THE FIRE; NEW RESPECT IN LAGUNA BEACH FOR FORCES OF 
NATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One year after fire swept through the hills and canyons of Laguna Beach, the 
earth and the residents remain heavily scarred. But there are signs of 
rejuvenation too, and a sense of lessons learned. 
</P>
<P>
 Homes are being rebuilt to withstand flames. Brush has been cut, to deprive 
future fires of fuel. New firefighting helicopters are on call. Those who were 
burned out, and those who were spared, have a renewed appreciation of the 
forces of nature and how quickly floods and flames, landslides and earthquakes 
can transform Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the effort to put a new home on scorched earth where the old home 
stood has proved too difficult, emotionally or financially. But many others 
opted to stay where they were, in a city long known for tolerance, the offbeat, 
dramatic views and a sense of rural living. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire destroyed nearly 400 homes and damaged dozens more in and around 
Laguna Beach. For those rebuilding, the process has been painfully slow. But 
residents told Times reporters they were not blaming anyone -- a refreshing 
change in today's America -- but had simply not realized how long it would 
take. After all, the homeowners had not been through this before. 
</P>
<P>
 One group with experience of disasters was the insurance industry, which 
appeared to have benefited from lessons imparted by past California fires and 
earthquakes. After receiving deserved criticism following the Oakland Hills 
fires of 1991, insurance companies seem to have responded in Orange County as 
they should. The three biggest insurers in the area have paid out nearly $195 
million in Laguna Beach so far. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials did a good job of cutting red tape for those wanting to 
rebuild, while also being properly cautious that geological faults that could 
result in landslides were not ignored. There were disputes over how much water 
pressure existed before the blazes and why partially filled reservoirs were not 
drained of water to fight the flames. But eventually the City Council made the 
tough calls that were needed, including one in favor of a new hilltop 
reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
 County fire officials rightly seized the moment and arranged to lease one 
firefighting helicopter and to fix and operate two others it received as 
military surplus. County officials had said there was no money to refurbish the 
two helicopters, but that changed with the fires. County supervisors realized 
the worth of the helicopters, and the public support for obtaining them. The 
county Fire Department did a good job in saving money, which helped finance the 
helicopter operations. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been some disputes among neighbors, often over the potential for 
blocked views when new, larger homes are built. But in a city noted for its 
tolerance, there does not appear to be an excess of bitter feuds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the back of everyone's mind, too, should be the awareness that fire is part 
of nature. Officials continually warn that in many areas of Southern California 
homes are built in the path of flames that are bound to erupt sooner or later. 
The danger can be minimized by clearing brush and making firebreaks, by using 
brick roofing rather than wood, by widening streets to make them more 
accessible to fire engines. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Laguna Beach fire chief, Richard Dewberry, has noted that fire "will 
happen again." Only by learning from the tragedy can people hope to minimize 
the effects of the next one. There are indications that Laguna Beach residents 
and officials in the city and the county are drawing the right lessons from the 
last year's firestorms.

FULLERTON CANDIDATE CLARIFIES TAX STANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Oct. 19, your newspaper inaccurately reported that I support a 
controversial utility tax in Fullerton. The following day, I was misquoted 
again when your paper related that I support that tax "unless it can be 
repealed without causing cuts in city services." 
</P>
<P>
 My position is and always has been to allow the tax to terminate as scheduled 
in September, 1995. To rescind the tax sooner would require the city to cut 
services commensurate with the revenue reduction or dip into reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 18, I was the runaway leader in a hotly contested election for 
Fullerton City Council. I must run again Nov. 8 to keep this seat. The utility 
tax issue could well make or break a candidate. Defeat by the careless slip of 
a reporter's pen would come hard indeed to me and the wonderful volunteers who 
have worked so hard on my campaign.

METZLER MERITS ELECTION IN 69TH DISTRICT; CHAMBER PRESIDENT UNDERSTANDS KEY 
ISSUES AND IS COMMITTED TO CITIES' WELFARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 69th Assembly District lies in the central part of Orange County, some of 
its oldest areas. But as traditional as this territory is, it also has 
undergone a great deal of change in recent years as immigrants have arrived 
seeking a better life.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, it is considered the only reliable legislative district for Democrats 
in a heavily Republican county. But voters there are conservative whatever 
their party affiliation, and the departure of popular incumbent Tom Umberg to 
run for attorney general this year created an open seat and an opportunity for 
all comers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans have sensed this and put up Anaheim businessman Jim Morrissey, 
who is extremely critical of what he perceives to be an overly regulatory 
commercial environment. This race is of such interest to Republicans that 
Assemblyman Rep. Mickey Conroy in the 71st District said he wanted to dispatch 
volunteer poll watchers. 
</P>
<P>
 An opportunity was created for Mike Metzler, the president and chief executive 
officer of the Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce, to move along to the general 
election when the district's Latino community was divided in the Democratic 
primary. 
</P>
<P>
 As chamber president, Metzler has served Santa Ana well by working to increase 
jobs and to build bridges to the school system through the Santa Ana 2000 
project. He is reasonable and moderate in style, committed to the welfare of 
the cities.  
</P>
<P>
 Metzler understands the importance of jobs, crime, immigration and education. 
He also knows the communities, and he knows the issues. His resume is broad and 
diverse, including work as a congressional aide, activity in a number of local 
charities and adviser to the California Chamber of Commerce on legislative 
issues.  
</P>
<P>
 While Morrissey is an agreeable candidate, he lacks the savvy and expertise 
that Metzler would bring to the job. 
</P>
<P>
 We endorse Mike Metzler. His strong background and knowledge can serve the 
district well during the next two years. He is positioned to help improve the 
jobs climate and to attend to housing and education issues.

REDEVELOPMENT A FISCAL SHELL GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his column "Redevelopment Is Paying Off for Fullerton" (Oct. 14), G.J. 
Brown fails to look at the big picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, redevelopment-aided projects have produced sales tax revenue, but how 
much of it was simply shifted away from other parts of the city? 
</P>
<P>
 The Metro Center, which Brown so proudly cites, is anchored by Loehmann's 
clothing store, which moved there from its previous site in north Fullerton. 
So, its sales taxes represent no net gain for the city. The subsidized Toys "R" 
Us store in the Town Center led directly to the shuttering of nearby Toy City, 
a longtime Fullerton business for more than 30 years. Similarly, the heavily 
subsidized Knowlwood's fast-food restaurant was open only six months when 
nearby Zono's went out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it fair to ask small businesses receiving no handouts to compete against 
government-subsidized competitors? 
</P>
<P>
 On an even broader scale, adjacent cities' predatory use of redevelopment has 
lured away shoppers and entire businesses that would previously have stayed in 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, hundreds of millions in property taxes that would have funded 
needed county and state services are diverted by cities to outbid each other 
for department stores and auto dealers. The (Santa Ana Freeway) is strewn with 
vacant and half-empty auto malls, all assembled at public expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is right in that closing Fullerton's Redevelopment Agency alone would 
not solve the problem. Reforms are needed at the state level to restore a level 
playing field for businesses and cities and put a lid on the wasteful fiscal 
shell game that redevelopment has become.

USE CAMERA / RADAR TO DETER SPEEDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The chronic speeder that struck and killed the young lady in Silverado Canyon 
is only one of thousands that Californians face each day. 
</P>
<P>
 In the tradition of our great democracy, the state Department of Motor 
Vehicles is studying the problem of how this type of errant driver is punished. 
</P>
<P>
 May I suggest a faster solution? Investigate camera/radar. Talk to a real 
expert, the chief of police in Edmonton, Canada, who has firsthand knowledge as 
to its effectiveness, having been clocked at 15 m.p.h. over the speed limit in 
his own city. If Silverado Canyon had a camera/radar in operation, the young 
man in question would have been sentenced to two years of highway cleanup years 
ago. More importantly, a beautiful young lady would still be with us.

HEWITT'S CRYSTAL BALL IS CLEARLY BIASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I predict Hugh Hewitt (Newport Beach attorney and "Life & Times" 
prognosticator) will be eating crow on Nov. 9, the day after elections, when 
his predictions about how Orange County voters will cast their ballots don't 
pan out. In his commentary ("Recession, Crime and Clinton Are Recipe for GOP 
Victories," Oct. 23), he bolsters his obviously biased support of Measure A by 
misrepresenting Larry Agran's plan for the reuse of the El Toro Marine base, 
and at the same time offering no proof that a commercial/cargo airport 
guarantees jobs.  
</P>
<P>
 On the Feinstein/Huffington race, Hewitt tells only part of the story, 
omitting important facts that weaken his position. All Leisure World residents 
I know and have met at many political events are not buzzing anger (his phrase 
and bias) at Sen. Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Hewitt could better serve Orange County and boost his credibility if he'd 
showed more objectivity and broadened his base of inquiry before drawing 
error-ridden conclusions. 
</P>

 * If necessity is the mother of invention, then partisan advocacy is often the 
father of political prognostication. Advocacy hidden as prognostication is 
intellectually dishonest and seductively suggestive, a powerful and dangerous 
form of political discourse. Suggesting the inevitability of an election 
outcome and doing so convincingly, for example, diminishes the electorate's 
belief in the independent autonomy and power of its franchise. Unfortunately, 
in the era of mass media politics, prediction has become just another word for 
endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, Hugh Hewitt illustrates his mastery of this deceptive art. Hewitt 
is entitled to endorse any candidate or ballot measure his loyal Republican 
heart desires and has ample opportunity to do so. But there is a stark 
dishonesty in Hewitt's penchant for masking endorsements as disinterested 
predictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Were Hewitt's endorsements also good predictions, readers might take seriously 
his most recent ruminations. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem is, Hewitt's record as a soothsayer in past general elections is quite 
weak. In 1992, for example, Hewitt "predicted" (i.e., endorsed) reelection for 
George Bush, Bruce Herschensohn's election as senator, and a GOP takeover of 
the California Legislature, among other crystal ball misreads. Hewitt's 
predictions for 1994 may also fall short. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugh Hewitt ate quite a few crows after the 1992 election. I hope my friend is 
plenty hungry on Nov. 9.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: LETTERS ON THE NOVEMBER ELECTIONS; THE DEBATE OVER RIGHTS 
AND WRONGS THAT IS PROPOSITION 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is unbelievable that so many respected and supposedly intelligent people 
have completely missed the full import of Proposition 187 and its real purpose. 
For those Americans, the proposition offers the only opportunity to protest 
strongly the occupation of our nation by other nations. The problem now is one 
of uncontrolled numbers of aliens, both legal and illegal, overwhelming every 
phase of California's infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there is no employment nor housing for vast numbers of these 
immigrants, they have become directly related to crime of every description. 
Many of those in opposition to the initiative are the same people who sold 
their family homes in the Los Angeles area in order to escape this invasion of 
poverty, crime, inferior schools and foreign languages. They have not looked 
back to see the destruction of most areas that have been lost to the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Vote yes on Proposition 187, paying no attention to the cries of racism and 
the other constitutional problems concerning the initiative. It will 
immediately be taken to the Supreme Court where most of it will be declared 
null and void by that learned group of officialdom. However, you will have 
given a political message to the Congress, which has chosen up to this point to 
completely ignore the problem. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * As an ESL instructor at Rancho Santiago College, I work with immigrant 
students. I, too, wonder about the problems that massive immigration is 
bringing to our country, but I see the cause as an uncontrolled population 
explosion that virtually no one is trying to do anything about. Study of the 
demographic statistics alone makes it obvious that people are going to be 
spilling over our borders. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the problem does need attention. I doubt, however, that the solution will 
be found in higher walls or stiffer laws, and the idea of forbidding education 
to children who are here illegally appalls me. Proposition 187, I am convinced, 
as The Times maintains in its editorial of Oct. 2, will lead to costly court 
cases and increased gangs. In addition, I believe that Proposition 187 will 
cause the widespread use of false documents forcing even children to engage in 
illegal behaviors. 
</P>
<P>
 In our search for answers, let us remember that immigrants, too, are people -- 
individuals with passions, dreams, minds -- just like the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
 CARLEEN ONO

<P>

</P>
<P>
 * In recent editorials and columns, The Times has emphasized supposed dire 
consequences when Proposition 187 passes. I recall another time when opponents 
of Proposition 13 had similar warning cries. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 is not perfect, nor was Proposition 13. Both propositions 
arise from the failure of government to address crisis conditions. Taxpaying 
citizens are saying with Proposition 187 that the time has come to fix the 
crisis. Solutions for big problems begin with the first step, precisely what 
Proposition 187 is. 
</P>
<P>
 Fine-tuning and modification will follow from the courts and Legislature, and 
Proposition 187 is a loud, clear message for them to get started now, and to 
use strong, effective means. I will vote for Proposition 187 and for candidates 
who recognize they are elected to serve taxpaying citizens first and foremost. 
</P>
<P>
 STEVEN D. ANDERSON 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * I am getting tired of American citizens who want laws upheld and criminal 
behavior stopped being labeled as racist. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who want illegal immigration stopped are called racists. Why? 
</P>
<P>
 Why is it that when an American citizen, who has worked so hard, in many cases 
for a lifetime, and wants to keep what little they've managed to accumulate are 
labeled racist for speaking up in their effort to do so? 
</P>
<P>
 Why is that?

 * The Times ran an article (Oct. 3) describing the opposition of many churches 
to Proposition 187, even to the extent of preaching against the proposal from 
the pulpit. This leaves no voice from the pews for those who disagree with 
their clergyman. 
</P>
<P>
 The church is free to educate and cure as many illegal aliens as it wishes to 
pay for. The tax-exempt church is free to pay taxes and then enter political 
debate. It is unfair, however, for the church to lecture a captive congregation 
on how to vote.

<P>
 * I am an Amerasian social worker who strongly opposes (Proposition 187) on an 
ethical agenda, not a financial one. This initiative does not address illegal 
immigration, but rather creates a police state. I, for one, will not report 
anyone on the "suspicion of being undocumented." To do so would negate 
everything that social work stands for, as well as fly in the face of both 
ethical and legal codes and would further lead to the destruction of our 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 VERONICA KELLEY

</P>
<P>
 * As the director of a shelter for battered women, Proposition 187 holds grave 
concerns. First, the loss of $10 million to $15 million in federal funds if 
Proposition 187 passes. Historically, social services agencies are the first to 
receive funding cuts when there is a shortfall in state funding. Second, and 
perhaps most important, battered women who are also immigrants will not only be 
battered by their partners, but battered by the system as well. Men who batter 
women who are also illegal immigrants frequently use the women's residency 
status as a tool for control. Even women who are eligible for a green card are 
denied access by the battering partner who may lock away important papers. 
</P>
<P>
 The question also arises as to sheltering battered women. Will we be forced to 
deny access to women who cannot produce the appropriate papers, thereby forcing 
them to return to the battering partner or living on the streets? 
</P>
<P>
 For God's sake, think about the consequences to the women and children who are 
the helpless victims of domestic violence. Please vote no on this 
unconscionably and unconstitutional Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 FRAN SHIFFMAN 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * While my friend Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) correctly blames 
the Democrat-controlled Congress for permitting illegal aliens to receive far 
too many taxpayer-funded services, Proposition 187 remains a fatally flawed and 
immoral response. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's lawsuit and the success of Operation Gatekeeper along the 
California border demonstrate that there are better ways to go around a 
recalcitrant Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also sheer hyperbole to suggest that we are "spending California into 
bankruptcy to provide benefits to illegal aliens." The demise of this state's 
once great economy is the result of high taxes and over-regulation on lawful 
businesses and citizens. Extremely low-wage jobs accepted by illegal aliens 
actually have helped many businesses and families survive in a very unfriendly 
economic environment -- not to mention the sales and other taxes derived from 
their economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Come on, illegal immigrants come here for a job, not a health plan! But once 
here, denying them a vaccination threatens all our health and our souls. By 
using innocent schoolchildren as bait and then denying an education to them, 
any conservative who votes for Proposition 187 brings shame to their advocacy 
of traditional family values. Do the right thing, we're better than this.

CONVENIENCE OF EL TORO AIRPORT ASIDE, MANY QUESTIONS LINGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The "NIMBYites" of Orange County would like to cast fear, confusion and 
negatives and have you believe having an international airport at El Toro is 
very non-beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, the issue is clear and simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Should I wish to take a nonstop flight to the Orient or to Europe, would I 
rather travel to LAX or El Toro? Frankly, I'll choose El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 The runways are there. The business community is ready to put together the 
brains, energy and money to make it a reality. Let's get on with it. Orange 
County needs a first-class international airport. Let's make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
 And incidentally, I own a property under the flight path and have always been 
thrilled to see and hear a flight of Marine F-18 jets fly overhead. That's what 
this country is all about. Let's not fight progress. 
</P>
<P>
 VICTOR H. JASHINSKI 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * The Times recently reported another "easy decision" by a North County city 
council. This time the Placentia City Council voted support for converting the 
El Toro Marine Corps Air Station to a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not too long ago that the same council, in concert with the councils of 
Yorba Linda, Brea and Fullerton and others in North County, were in the fight 
against the same Orange County big-development interests -- now promoting the 
commercial airport at El Toro -- who were then trying to locate a major airport 
atop Chino Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The North County cities that now praise the economic benefits to themselves if 
El Toro becomes a commercial airport were rabid environmentalists then, crying 
about the deterioration of the quality of residential life in their cities. 
Their cries of anguish of "not in my back yard" were answered by pressure at 
the state level, and the Chino Hills airport location became the Chino Hills 
State Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the North County tears have dried and another back yard has been 
found for an airport far from their cities, the unthinkable airport is now a 
fine idea. In truth, the airport was a bad idea for the Chino Hills and the 
cities around it. A second county commercial airport is equally a bad idea fro 
El Toro and the surrounding cities. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope the residents of North County cities have more sensitivity than their 
councils. 
</P>
<P>
 SINCLAIR JONES 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * Opinions vary on the need for El Toro to remain an airport, and the 
strongest views are held by those who are or might be affected by the air 
traffic. Since voters will be deciding the issue, they should realize that 
statements made by Irvine, Lake Forest, Mission Viejo, Laguna Hills and Newport 
Beach residents tend to be biased. Hopefully, we will have the advantage of 
deciding the issue on information put forth by unbiased experts who study the 
facts. 
</P>
<P>
 ROBERT F. OLSON 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 * I would like to raise an issue which, to date, both the proponents and 
opponents of Measure A and the proposed El Toro airport have failed to address, 
and which constitutes what may be the greatest single expense to this county's 
taxpayers if a civilian airport ever arises on that site. 
</P>
<P>
 For at least 20 years, California law has required that homeowners adversely 
affected by the noise of jet aircraft operations, particularly takeoffs and 
landings, be entitled to compensation from the airport owners and operators in 
the dollar amount of the diminution of their homes' market value caused by that 
noise. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of the varied takeoff and landing patterns which would have to be 
used, there is probably not one community in Orange County south of and 
including Irvine that would not be adversely affected by the noise which a 
fully functioning civilian airport would generate. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, the issue certainly demonstrates why a complete study is 
needed before any irrevocable decisions on the airport are made, whether by the 
voters or by the governmental representatives charged with evaluating the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Measure A, as a resident of the Saddleback Valley and an attorney whose 
practice encompasses inverse condemnation issues, my own reactions are mixed. 
Although I view with alarm the prospect of the decimation of the values of my 
and my neighbors' homes, and the degradation of the quality of our lives -- 
which a fully functioning airport would create -- I cannot but help be tempted 
by an initiative which, if passed, will amount to a lifetime full-employment 
act for me and a lot of my colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 ANDREW M. SUSSMAN 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santa Margarita 
</P>
<P>
 * Proponents of Measure A, the El Toro Airport Initiative, claimed that a 
commercial airport, preferably an international one, will be an economic 
panacea for Orange County. Yet, they have not been able to provide facts to 
substantiate their arguments on costs and revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, there is one major and crucial flaw in the arguments favoring 
a 4,700-acre airport facility as the only viable option for jobs and revenues. 
El Toro is surrounded by a 16,000-acre restricted area, designated as a safety 
and noise buffer zone, hailed by the proponents as minimizing environmental 
impacts to nearby residents. 
</P>
<P>
 However, without an airport these 16,000 acres will be available for 
development! Will even an additional development of 5,000 acres create more 
jobs and revenues? You bet it will! In fact, an El Toro airport may even have a 
detrimental impact on the economic development of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 PAUL WILLEMS 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Niguel 
</P>
<P>
 * Orange County voters have the opportunity to help revitalize the economy in 
our area. Allowing the El Toro base to be a commercial airport has the 
potential to create over 50,000 new jobs and generate billions in new economic 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, too many businesses have left and others are leaving the county 
because we have over-regulated, over-taxed, and been insensitive to their 
needs. We must send a new message, and providing an additional airport that can 
meet their growing needs is a step in the right direction.

 Does Laguna still have a unique spirit? 
</P>
<P>
 The upcoming election is tearing the town apart. Some say it's a simple matter 
of pro-development people against anti-development people. 
</P>
<P>
 Are we as townspeople becoming morose, narcissistic and greedy, as some 
anthropologists say America has already become, or are we willing to commit 
ourselves to Laguna as a unique place with a unique spirit? 
</P>
<P>
 Congratulations to those townspeople who are friendly; to the seniors and 
others who have offered employment, if only an afternoon a week, to Latinos; to 
the businesses and others helping young people get green cards; to those who 
walk and bike in Laguna; to the Chamber of Commerce that refused to back down 
in supporting Gay Pride Weekend; to the women in the Rotary Club who have 
brought new energy to a once all-male enclave, and to all who believe this is 
and can be a unique place in space.

TALK IS CHEAP IN FULLERTON ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are so many people running for the Fullerton City Council that it looks 
like a cavalry charge, but how can we tell the qualified candidates from those 
who just like to run? How can a voter determine who has common sense and who 
will say anything to get elected? One good way is to look for logical 
consistency. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last four years, Fullerton's operating funds budget has declined from 
$48.5 million to $45.3 million.In response, the city has reduced its work force 
by 13% since 1991 -- nearly 100 positions. Next year's budget will reduce staff 
by at least 20 positions, and an additional 25 positions will be eliminated 
when custodial services are contracted out. Over the last decade, Fullerton's 
population has increased by more than 20,000, yet its number of city employees 
has decreased! 
</P>
<P>
 The record shows that Fullerton has been one of the best-administered cities 
in Orange County for many years. Voters should ask who is irresponsible, those 
who have struggled to maintain service in the face of declining resources or 
those who will say anything to get elected. Then they should vote accordingly.

PROP. 188 IS TOBACCO INDUSTRY'S PLOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Nov. 8, Californians will decide an issue of critical importance to the 
health of each of us: Proposition 188. This is the so-called California Uniform 
Tobacco Control Act, sponsored by Philip Morris Inc. If you think Philip Morris 
and the tobacco industry are really concerned about controlling the use of 
tobacco and preventing cigarette-related illness and deaths in California, 
think again. 
</P>
<P>
 Their deceptively worded initiative seemingly offers protection to nonsmokers 
from exposure to secondhand smoke. In fact, it rolls back hard-won gains to 
eliminate smoking from restaurants, workplaces and other public places and 
would set back state indoor clean-air standards by more than a decade. It would 
repeal the recent enactment of AB13, signed by Gov. Pete Wilson to ban smoking 
in virtually all public places, as well as over 300 stronger local ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 Former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop has stated that "Prop. 188 is 
hazardous to your health. Philip Morris . . . is spending millions of dollars 
to pass Prop. 188 to protect industry profits. It should be called the 'Tobacco 
Industry Protection Act.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 188 aims to bring smoking back -- in workplaces and in restaurants 
-- and keep it back. Cities and counties will be prohibited from enacting any 
tougher tobacco control laws, and the only possible redress would be through a 
two-thirds vote of the state Legislature. If passed, more than 1 million 
nonsmoking workers in California will be exposed to secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Heart Assn., American Cancer Society, American Lung Assn., the 
California State PTA, American Medical Assn. and many other organizations are 
weighing in against Prop. 188. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember to vote no on 188, and urge your friends and family to do likewise.

SUBWAY VOTE WAS RIGHT DECISION FOR THE VALLEY; IT'S TIME FOR MTA TO FIND 
FUNDING, AND CRITICS TO MOVE ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority did the right thing on Wednesday in 
voting to extend the Red Line across the San Fernando Valley via a separate 
subway route, and not by an elevated line along the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago in this bitter debate, there had been a time in which engineering 
factors and other considerations appeared to favor the elevated option. That 
time has long since passed. It's also true that the Northridge quake taught us 
a vital lesson about the fragility of the freeway network we depend upon so 
heavily. Bridges collapsed, interchanges were closed and entire sections of 
roadway were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 As we have stated before, the Southern California transportation system must 
become less dependent on freeways and it must offer more options. What if the 
next major quake damages the Ventura Freeway in the way that the Northridge 
temblor affected the Golden State, Santa Monica and Simi Valley freeways? You 
remember the traffic jams, confusing alternative routes, the hours added to 
commute times. 
</P>
<P>
 Running the Red Line across the Valley along Burbank and Chandler boulevards 
provides another east-west transportation corridor. It increases the chances 
for survivability of one of those routes in the event of another big quake. 
</P>
<P>
 For that and many other reasons, Mayor Richard Riordan said that the MTA's 8-5 
vote in favor of the subway was "clearly the right decision." So did County 
Supervisor Ed Edelman, who added that the decision represented "a great day for 
the Valley." Also on board was an overwhelming majority of the Los Angeles City 
Council and the city's transportation department. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Consider the following: 
</P>
<P>
 * By most estimates, the cost advantage of the freeway route had evaporated, 
and $159 million has already been spent on obtaining rights of way for the 
subway route. 
</P>
<P>
 * According to city transportation officials, the subway route can be more 
easily integrated with existing bus lines. 
</P>
<P>
 * Building the subway will involve less traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 * It will be easier to construct, segment by segment, should funding problems 
arise. 
</P>
<P>
 * Passengers will have a seamless ride from Canoga Park to Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 * The subway route will serve more heavily populated areas than the freeway 
route. 
</P>
<P>
 * The subway route enjoys the support of most homeowner associations and civic 
groups in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the MTA has been embarrassed by tunneling problems and a cutoff of 
federal funding. But the MTA is doing the right things to rectify the damage, 
particularly in dissolving the Rail Construction Corp., which has overseen 
subway construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it's up to the MTA to move smartly forward with the kind of thorough and 
convincing environmental studies that will secure federal funding for the 
project. It's also time for the MTA to continue to make the kind of management 
changes that will ensure that future subway tunnels will be properly built, on 
time and on budget. And it's time for the opponents of the subway route to 
finally admit defeat, and move on.

REFRESHING DEBATE IN BEILENSON-SYBERT RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congratulations to John Schwada for a most accurate story on the first debate 
between Rep. Anthony Beilenson and his opponent, Richard Sybert ("Beilenson 
Backs Democrats in Debate with GOP's Rich Sybert," Oct. 12). 
</P>
<P>
 I was present Tuesday morning when they spoke to us seniors.It was most 
refreshing to hear Rep. Beilenson speak about all the accomplishments of the 
present Administration and not deride Mr. Sybert. I am sick and tired of all 
the berating that people running for office do against one another. Please tell 
us voters what you intend to accomplish should you be voted into office. Do not 
knock the other fellow; that is hitting below the belt, particularly when it 
may be false and a half-truth. 
</P>
<P>
 We want to know what your intentions are in making the United States a better 
place. We want to know what plans you have formulated. We want to know your 
qualifications. We want to know all about you, and not your opponent's failings 
as you see them. As responsible voters we will weigh the pros and cons. At 
least that is what I do.

GOOD REASONS FOR CITY'S LEASE LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have to wonder what your secret agenda was in the editorial "San Fernando's 
Ridiculous Lease Law" (Oct. 22). In this day of voter apathy and political 
corruption, your tirade against a law made by the people for their community is 
highly suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 This law came about because the City Council had approved a controversial land 
swap with the county regarding the old police station, which is a valuable 
location in our civic center. When the people did a referendum to place that 
deal on the ballot, the council rescinded their deal rather than let the voters 
see the ridiculous terms. End of public trust.  
</P>
<P>
 The lease agreement on the ballot in November is much like the original land 
swap on the old police station. It looks good until you know the terms. You 
failed to state that because it doesn't allow any rate increases and San 
Fernando pays for all the utilities, repairs and improvements, the city could 
end up with no profit. Having the San Fernando taxpayers pay for posh offices 
for the Los Angeles city attorneys may be the Los Angeles Times' idea of a good 
deal. Or perhaps you just don't know the terms? How silly of you. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the cost of the ballot measure, you're wrong again. The cost is $3,000, 
not the $13,000 to $15,000 you quoted. If you are really concerned about costs, 
you should review the incompetence and mismanagement that has cost the city 
millions in cost overrides and legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of San Fernando needs campaign-contribution and term limitation on 
the ballot. Only then can it hope to eliminate outside influence on city 
elections and begin to clean up the city's politics.

CATCHING UP TO THE 20TH CENTURY; DONATED NIGHT-VISION GOGGLES WILL HELP LAPD, 
BUT THEY SHOULD BE SHARED AMONG DIVISIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just about everybody has access to the "starlight technology" involved in 
night-vision goggles or scopes. Well, everybody except much of the Los Angeles 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Mathis of the International Assn. of Chiefs of Police says the technology 
was first used in the Vietnam War and was employed by his colleagues on the 
police force in Kansas City beginning in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 These devices convert available light into electrical energy and then boost it 
into visible, greenish-white images. But the earliest models that Mathis 
describes were cumbersome and bulky. Now, the options range from a palm-sized 
Russian "moonwalker" that you can obtain through the American Wild Bird Co. in 
Rockville, Md. (for $399), to more expensive models costing $2,900. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two points to be made here. First, the fact that the LAPD obtained 
its few scopes through donations from a civic group and from ITT Gilfillan of 
Van Nuys is another striking example of how starved the department is for 
modern technology. Simply put, this technology has been accessible to state, 
local and private authorities for years. 
</P>
<P>
 In Percy, Ill., for example, security guards have used night scopes to protect 
encampments of temporary workers from striking coal miners. In New York City, 
transit police use them to sneak up on subway car graffiti taggers. In 
California, wardens of the Department of Fish and Game use the goggles to hunt 
for poachers. Even deer hunters have used them to get a leg up on their elusive 
prey, although you'd be hard-pressed to get one to admit it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the five Night Enforcer 250 scopes from ITT Gilfillan will give the 
LAPD's Van Nuys division a nocturnal surveillance advantage. The scope given to 
police by the citizens group Supporters of Law Enforcement in Devonshire has 
already been used to capture two suspected rapists in Chatsworth Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the Van Nuys division has five scopes, one or two ought to be shared 
with the other San Fernando Valley police divisions. That will help bring the 
force into the 20th Century before the century ends.

FIGHTING FIRE WITH FIRE; A PREVENTIVE PROGRAM FOR WILD LANDS SHOULD INCLUDE 
REGULAR CONTROLLED BURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five months before the Topanga Canyon chapter of last year's frightening 
firestorms, homeowners succeeded in blocking a controlled burn in the area by 
the Los Angeles County Fire Department. It was an indication that homeowners -- 
reluctant to take risks -- still held sway, and that little ground had been 
gained by the proponents of so-called prescribed burning, which seeks to 
eliminate some of the fuel that can result in later conflagrations. 
</P>
<P>
 The pendulum is now swinging back. Just listen to the federal officials who 
are ready to retire Smokey the Bear, or at least cut his hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Smokey Bear message for 50 years has been effective -- fire is bad," said 
John Douglas, director of the U. S. Interior Department's office of hazard and 
fire programs coordination. "We have to add another dimension to it -- that 
fire can be good if it's used in the right place at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
 Translation: Tens of thousands of acres of forests and other wild lands should 
be treated with preventive burning annually. And the Clinton Administration has 
even opened discussions with the Environmental Protection Agency to negotiate 
waivers to the Clean Air Act to allow more controlled burns. If this gains 
further momentum, it is sure to influence state and local policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the sea change? The reasons include another staggering summer of wildfires 
in the West, a price tag of nearly $700 million to fight them, the deaths of 27 
federal firefighters, and last year's Southern California firestorms. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that public cooperation locally in terms of brush clearance 
has greatly improved. As of October, fewer than 1% of the wild land parcels 
patrolled by county fire officials were considered overgrown. And Los Angeles 
city officials have nearly doubled their inspections of fire hazards in vacant 
lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Those on the fire lines figure to be better prepared than ever as well, with 
water-carrying Super Scooper airplanes now stationed at Van Nuys Airport, with 
fire engines now outfitted with swimming pool siphons, and with National Guard 
C-130 airplanes available within 13 hours instead of the usual 24 hours. After 
four Los Angeles city firefighters were badly burned in a blaze near Chatsworth 
last year, firefighters also are being equipped with more safety gear. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, it may not be enough to prevent or quickly contain another 
conflagration. That's why federal officials are changing course, and why the 
preventive efforts of citizens and local officials have never been more 
important.

HEARTLESS EFFORTS TO REPEAL CITIZENSHIP CLAUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I want to congratulate Ron Tasoff for his thoughtful and powerful analysis 
(Oct. 16) of the efforts of Congressman Anthony Beilenson and challenger 
Richard Sybert in the 24th Congressional District to repeal the citizenship 
clause of the 14th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 I find the efforts of our congressman and his challenger cruel, heartless and 
contrary to the essence of our democracy.Just the historic entry of the 
citizenship clause after the Civil War to ensure citizenship to the former 
slaves should stand to preserve the sanctity of the cherished right of all the 
American-born to have American citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 Can you imagine what racial/ethnic divisiveness and hatred such a proposed 
constitutional amendment to deprive citizenship to the American-born or illegal 
immigrants would cause in this country? 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Why, when such an initiative would have little impact on illegal entry? 
Could these positions be "good politics," as Ron Tasoff proposes? If so, then I 
agree, Mr. Tasoff. Shame, shame!

ILLEGAL STUDENTS GIVEN PREFERENTIAL COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your front page on Oct. 23 had two stories showing what the Los Angeles Times 
considers to be of import. One featured an illegal alien student attending Cal 
State Northridge; the other, the shooting death of a Los Angeles police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The illegal alien student has his color photograph on the first page, and 
other illegal aliens are given large photos on pages 26 and 27. The officer's 
photograph is buried on page 28. 
</P>
<P>
 The prominence you gave to the illegal aliens is an insult to the officer who 
gave his life to the city. The Los Angeles Times has gone too far in political 
correctness. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to a belief of your newspaper and leftist Democrats, the state of 
California is not a province of Mexico. The victory of Proposition 187 will be 
proof that the state of California belongs to the United States of America. 
</P>
<P>
 The illegal alien students should be immediately picked up and deported to the 
country of origin or pay the tuition charged to foreign students. 
</P>
<P>
 When the trustees are proposing to raise student fees by 10%, it does not make 
any sense to allow illegal aliens to attend California State University without 
paying higher tuition. It is an injustice to the thousands of foreign students 
who pay the higher tuition. This is another example that people who play by the 
rules are the fools.

MARRIAGE NOT ENOUGH TO QUALIFY FOR OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barbara Yaroslavsky wants to represent the 5th City Council District, but 
qualifications for office are not absorbed through marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Would you let your surgeon's spouse perform your appendectomy? Would you let 
the pilot's spouse fly your jumbo jet? Barbara Yaroslavsky has no experience in 
public office whatsoever, other than dinner conversation and pillow talk with 
her husband, Zev. 
</P>
<P>
 These are grievous times for the 5th District. We face the seemingly 
insurmountable task of rebuilding our neighborhoods from the devastation of 
Jan. 17. The inner city has not yet recovered from the riots, and race 
relations and conflicts over illegal immigration threaten to Balkanize our 
melting pot. The police are overwhelmed by the armed thugs taking over our 
once-peaceful communities. The city is struggling to cope with an enduring 
recession, stretching and reallocating dollars to make $5 cover debts of $10. 
</P>
<P>
 The public's distrust of incumbents and career politicians notwithstanding, 
now is not the time to have a neophyte in City Council. If Barbara Yaroslavsky 
truly cares about Los Angeles, she should recognize that we need an 
experienced, heavily qualified leader in 1995 and she should withdraw her 
candidacy immediately.

NOTHING UNETHICAL IN CONTRIBUTIONS TO HOGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your Oct. 22 story about Assemblyman Bill Hoge has caused me no small amount 
of concern. The main focus was on his "connection" to gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Hoge is one of the very few candidates not running a smear-the-opponent 
campaign. He has co-authored many tough crime bills and is working with Atty. 
Gen. Dan Lungren to regulate the gambling industry in California. He stands on 
his record, not on fabricating dirt against his opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 The opponent's entire campaign seems to rest on the emotional play of how 
despicable gambling is. Excuse me, but has anyone noticed that the state public 
school system is "connected" to gambling? Or is it pure and honorable only when 
the state runs a nightly numbers game? Furthermore, I happen to enjoy going to 
the races. It is a favorite pastime in my Scottish clan, and we are not a bunch 
of hoodlums. Hoge's opponent has no political stand of his own to promote so he 
has chosen to work the emotional appeal of gambling for all that it is worth, 
and The Times is a very willing accomplice in this murky assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Where do campaign contributions come from? From those who wish to support 
legislators who support them. In the instance of horse tracks and card rooms we 
are looking at Southern California business. Who is business? Thousands of 
Southern Californians who are employed, directly and indirectly, by the tracks 
and card rooms. Why are these business people being treated as if they were 
pariahs? 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic opponent is receiving sizable campaign contributions from the 
Willie Brown camp. Willie Brown is a Northern California assemblyman. Willie 
Brown is Speaker of the state Assembly. Willie Brown is carpetbagging in my 
district, trying to replace my Assembly representative with a candidate that 
would owe Willie Brown political favors if he were to get into office in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 It is indeed ethical for local businessmen to back a local candidate. I'm 
voting for the candidate who has done the best job for me over the past two 
years: Bill Hoge.

POLITICAL CORRECTNESS: IT CAN HAPPEN HERE; FROM HYPHEN- AMERICANISM TO THE CULT 
OF VICTIMIZATION, STRANGE NEW RULES HAVE COME TO ANTELOPE VALLEY COLLEGE. THIS 
'60S-ERA LIBERAL IS GETTING FRUSTRATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE PHILBIN HALL, Janice Philbin Hall is a professor of English at 
Antelope Valley College. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The average person would probably think that I have my nerve to complain about 
my job. For 22 years I've taught English at Antelope Valley College. Unlike 
some schools, our campus is clean, green and crime-free; and I get paid to 
teach the world's most beautiful and profound works of literature. So how can I 
possibly feel such an enormous sense of anger and frustration? 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, it has gradually dawned on me that I'm not politically correct. 
Not being very politically astute, I was slow to realize that the current 
academic track turned sharply left a while back and left me behind -- and 
bewildered. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people undoubtedly believe that the Antelope Valley provides a refuge 
from this PC madness, but believe me, they're wrong. Nowhere in academia is 
there such a haven. 
</P>
<P>
 And what clearly is PC at the moment is to be a hyphen-American. Yes, the myth 
of "multiculturalism" has swept over us like a California wildfire, devouring 
historical and educational tradition along with reality and common sense. 
Present-day Americans are encouraged to identify with whatever precedes their 
hyphen: African-Americans, Asian-Americans, Slobovian-Americans. So our 
textbooks and our courses must reflect this separatist agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even here at AVC, an African-American Faculty and Staff Assn. has recently 
been formed; all students must now satisfy a "diversity" requirement, and 
instructors must now distribute student evaluation forms that are absolutely 
required to query students on only one specific issue: "sensitivity to 
diversity." And, predictably, the word racism , once rare on this campus, now 
pops up in virtually every context. E pluribus unum is out; assimilation is 
out; integration is out; tribalism is in. 
</P>
<P>
 And, although I'm a feminist, I'm angry that a recently filled administration 
position obviously had been slated exclusively for a woman. Call me naive, but 
I still think that equal opportunity should never have become preferential 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Another issue that, as a feminist, I'm quite concerned about is the 
ever-expanding definition of "sexual harassment." 
</P>
<P>
 Only a thug would be opposed to a policy absolutely forbidding genuine sexual 
harassment. Only a Neanderthal-American would fail to condemn a supervisor who 
solicits sex under the threat of reprisal, or a teacher who demands sexual 
favors in exchange for a grade. 
</P>
<P>
 However, leaping aboard the victimization bandwagon, the college trustees this 
month approved a policy that would make virtually any nuance definable as 
sexual harassment. It says, "Verbal examples include, but are not limited to: 
derogatory comments, innuendoes, slurs, jokes, epithets. Physical examples 
include . . . assault, touching, impeding or blocking movement. Visual examples 
include . . . leering, gestures, display of sexually offensive objects or 
pictures, cartoons, or posters." Patting, hugging and making "remarks of a 
sexual nature about one's clothing" are specifically warned against. The 
college's personnel director is the investigator and determiner of guilt or 
innocence. The board ignored a Faculty Senate proposal that mediation precede 
any formal action, and that the policy spell out the rights of the accused. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, not only will I have to worry that one of my students will accuse me of 
not being sensitive to his particular aspect of diversity, but I'll have to 
shudder whenever I glance at a student for fear that he will run to complain 
that he's been sexually harassed by leer. (Of course, I realize that it's 
really those beastly males that this policy is targeting.) 
</P>
<P>
 Another part of the PC agenda is the egalitarian notion that everyone should 
be in college, and succeed in college, so practically every day I must confront 
students whose skills and awareness are embarrassingly substandard. I wince 
when students in class blurt out the most inane comments, followed by the 
snickers of their more sophisticated classmates. It's not PC to say so, but 
many people don't belong in college, and higher education should be higher than 
something!  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, I recently made an amazing discovery: I, a '60s-era liberal who 
grew up in a single-parent, blue-collar family, implicitly stand accused of 
being a part of the "white ruling class" that is denying access to the power in 
our culture by failing students "of color." Quite to the contrary, my 
colleagues and I spend a disproportionate amount of time trying to ensure that 
these students succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything I'm saying would be labeled by the PC crowd as "conservative," and 
in PC academia, "conservative" is a nasty word. But I simply refuse to mislead 
my students into believing in a PC fantasy world in which unsupported 
"feelings" equal knowledge, all dialects are as valid as standard English, all 
subcultural values and practices are worthwhile and equivalent to mainstream 
American culture, revisionist fantasy "history" replaces established 
scholarship and marginal literature stands shoulder to shoulder with Ernest 
Hemingway or William Faulkner -- or, for that matter, with Ernest Gaines or 
Alice Walker. 
</P>
<P>
 And I refuse to accept the implication that all men are predators and even a 
compliment from a male colleague makes me a victim of harassment, and that 
white males in particular are responsible for all the ills of society. 
</P>
<P>
 So I'm angry. I'm frustrated. I'm politically incorrect.

STANDS ON LOCAL ISSUES COULD DECIDE 24TH DISTRICT RACE; CONSTITUENCY DOES NOT 
REALLY FEEL CONNECTED TO WHAT IS MAKING THE NEWS IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL. 
VOTERS' CONCERNS ARE ABOUT THE THINGS THAT AFFECT THEM DIRECTLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL CLARKE, Paul Clarke of Northridge is a corporate political consultant. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "All politics is local," Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill, the late Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, opined. And, in its enigmatic way, it's one of the 
very few political axioms that actually work out to be true. Its effect is 
especially tough on candidates running for offices that are not local. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, and for every election since, candidates for Congress have been asked 
where they stand on Proposition 13 -- the state's property tax-cutting 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 It defined for voters those candidates who supported a tax break versus those 
who didn't. The pesky details didn't matter. The entire California Democrat 
establishment opposed Proposition 13. It hurt incumbents in 1978. Now-Atty. 
Gen. Dan Lungren defeated an incumbent congressman that year largely on the 
strength of Proposition 13, after having lost to him two years before. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, congressional candidates have been asked for eight years if they 
supported or opposed Rose Bird's confirmation in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 13 and Rose Bird had nothing to do with congressional actions. 
They were, however, defining issues for California voters. Another potentially 
defining issue appears on next month's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional races are filled with candidate appearances at which the 
majority of the questions concern issues over which Congress has no 
jurisdiction -- real estate development, local crime, traffic hazards. The 
candidate who is primed to talk about foreign trade and nuclear proliferation 
is often caught off guard. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1980s when George Bush was vice president, his staff would 
contact the staffs of congressional offices in the areas he was to visit. They 
would ask, "What are the local issues?" Bush's people did not want him trapped 
by a question regarding a local sewer bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe Tip O'Neill meant "local" to mean those issues voters "back home" 
read about in their local newspapers, not what appears in the Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
 When I wrote two months ago about the 24th Congressional District race between 
incumbent Anthony Beilenson and challenger Richard Sybert, Congress was still 
in session. The local news was filled with stories about health care reform, 
various international crises and, of course, the O.J. Simpson trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The only one of those stories still in the paper with any regularity is 
Simpson, and even it's lost a lot of its excitement and immediacy. The trial 
itself will not get under way until after the election. Nationally, the only 
consistent story now is how poorly the pundits think Democrats will fare at the 
polls. Internationally, unless there is large-scale violence, Haiti is a 
yawner. And, until he tries something stupid, Saddam Hussein is old news. 
</P>
<P>
 If "all politics is local," national voting trends don't affect local races. 
Bob Dole could become Senate majority leader. Less likely -- but possible -- 
Newt Gingrich could become House Speaker. That kind of shift holds little 
interest to voters in Reseda, Woodland Hills or Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 They do not perceive Washington insider issues as having an effect on them. 
Illegal aliens standing on street corners or carjackers lurking at the ATM are 
far more potent images. Dick Riordan's 1993 campaign brochure featuring a 
scruffy looking homeless man on the cover welcoming voters to "Mike Woo's Los 
Angeles" won Riordan more votes than his term limit initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's capturing the voters' attention in the 24th District? Crime, 
underground versus monorail for Metrorail, various real estate developments 
and, most significantly, Proposition 187 -- the state immigration initiative. 
As the two candidates square off for more forums in this final campaign week, 
these are the topics voters are likely to ask about, not international trade 
agreements or lobbying reform. 
</P>
<P>
 What have the candidates said about these non-federal issues? After the last 
article I wrote dealing with the history of elections in Beilenson's district, 
my mailman lugged a pound of issue papers to my door from challenger Sybert. 
</P>
<P>
 An enclosed book had three paragraphs on schools, decidedly not a 
congressional front-burner issue. A packet of op-ed pieces penned by Sybert 
included one on crime. His campaign brochure includes a mention of growth 
management. His comparison brochure points out that he opposed Rose Bird. He 
even mentions that he is supported by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Organization 
-- code words for supporting Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
 While crime and taxes are always effective standbys, the lightning rod in this 
election is clearly Proposition 187. This could provide the nexus between the 
national trend against Democrats and the local issue dominating the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert supports 187. Beilenson opposes it. As this issue takes up more and 
more space in newspapers and more time on television news, it moves toward the 
top of the issues list in voters' consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite high-level opposition, including that of the Mexican government, the 
U.S. President and 70,000 marchers waving Mexican flags in Downtown Los 
Angeles, polls reveal that support for Proposition 187 remains strong among 
most voter groups. This, then, becomes a defining issue and creates a litmus 
test for candidates. The races on the top of the ticket have argued over little 
else for the past week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert can capitalize on Proposition 187, putting Beilenson on the defensive. 
If the margins in favor of this proposal in the most recent Times poll hold up 
through election day, it could be the issue that denies Beilenson his 10th 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, a backlash could develop against the initiative between now and 
Election Day. In 1978 an initiative to ban homosexuals from teaching positions 
failed after initial support in polls. Voters, apparently, felt the penalties 
were too Draconian and the definitions of who was or who wasn't were too mushy. 
</P>
<P>
 So, we come back to political axioms. The other one that almost always holds 
true has been around for more than 2,000 years. The Roman poet Horace wrote 
carpe diem -- seize the day. The candidate in the 24th District who can 
effectively communicate he has firmly seized it will be the winner when dawn 
breaks Nov. 9.

AN EXPLANATION FOR THOSE NASDAQ'S WIDE SPREADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have been an equity institutional salesman most of my 27 years at Smith 
Barney. The reason for wide OTC spreads on the Nasdaq ("Is This a Fair Trade?" 
Oct. 20) is obvious to anyone who works in that market every day. Institutional 
investors insist that market makers be good for a minimum number of shares at 
their bid and ask prices. The minimum is 10,000 shares for most stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Market makers are afraid to make a bid or ask inside that spread, even to 
accommodate a client order, for fear of getting hit for the 10,000 shares. 
Since most traders have dozens of stocks they are trading at once, they program 
their computers to automatically adjust their bids and asks to the mean unless 
they have a large position to move. Surely you've noticed OTC stocks running up 
and down substantially without any trades as the computers follow the leader. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, you have the New York Stock Exchange auction system where any 
client can place an order on the specialist's book for any number of shares at 
any price. If a client enters 100 shares, he is only obligated to trade 100 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is that the NYSE's auction quotes are tighter but thin. The OTC 
market maker's quotes are wide and deep for many institutional clients. The 
small OTC investor is left with a wide spread and no one willing to represent 
his order between the bid and ask. 
</P>
<P>
 The obvious solution is to have Nasdaq reprogram its computers to quote "net" 
(size) prices and "agency" (auction) markets separately, or with some kind of 
code. A client could then direct his broker to enter his order on the "agent" 
system. Although this system wouldn't prevent "trading through," it would allow 
clients to deal with each other without exposing the market makers to the 
additional risk that increases spreads. Such a system already exists on the 
NYSE. It is called 19C3 trading. Let's face it, today's computer systems make a 
Nasdaq market maker system look like the Model T.

TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS: EXPOSITION PARK COULD BECOME A MODEL OF BENEFICIAL 
GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. Eugene Grigsby III, director fo UCLA's Center for Afro-American Studies 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To improve economic and social conditions in cities, local decision makers are 
constantly looking for ways to stimulate job growth. What policy makers desire 
most are strategies that result in high-wage employment opportunities with 
minimum adverse environmental consequences such as air pollution and traffic. 
Programs designed to reduce unemployment in inner-city locations are, of 
course, particularly desirable. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, a number of cities promoted downtown revitalization, both to remove 
blight and to stimulate new employment. With local governments as advocates and 
the federal government providing needed capital, private developers 
systematically built thousands of square feet of office and retail space in 
major metropolitan areas across the country, Los Angeles included. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, mounting empirical evidence suggests that this approach has 
redistributed jobs, not produced new ones. Downtown redevelopment removed 
retail establishments that employed low-skill workers and replaced them with 
office towers that cater to a different work force. 
</P>
<P>
 A weak economy has resulted in shrinking demand for both office and retail 
space -- and for the time being, at least, has caused policy makers to abandon 
the downtown revitalization approach for more fruitful means of job creation. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, two kinds of economic development strategies are 
emerging. 
</P>
<P>
 One is regional initiatives, as exemplified by the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority's 20-year plan and Calstart's efforts to establish an electric car 
industry. Proponents of this strategy assume that growth in jobs throughout the 
region will serve as a stimulus to improve the quality of life for a large 
number of the region's residents, as well as uplifting distressed 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 An inherent weakness in the regional strategy is that it provides no direct 
link to the low-income communities that contain the largest number of 
chronically unemployed and low-skill workers. Thus, as with the old downtown 
revitalization approach, there is little likelihood that regional initiatives 
per se will provide much in the way of economic benefit to the growing number 
of residents in low-income neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, strategies designed specifically to overcome the weaknesses 
of the regional approaches are being advocated by a host of community-based 
organizations, including the Coalition of Neighborhood Developers, Communities 
for Accountable Reinvestment (CAR) and the Assn. of Street Vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with these approaches, however, is that they often are limited in 
scale and do not tie in with broader regional economic development forces. So 
while their objectives -- reducing hard-core unemployment and redirecting 
capital into low-income neighborhoods -- may be laudable, success again will be 
difficult to document. 
</P>
<P>
 What clearly seems to be missing is a better way to link the two approaches so 
that regional economic growth will continue and low-income workers and 
neighborhoods will derive direct benefits from that growth. 
</P>
<P>
 One step toward achieving this linkage might be to identify how regional 
initiatives can explicitly address issues associated with the alleviation of 
poverty, notably job creation. The flip side is evaluating current 
opportunities for neighborhood-based development to capitalize on regional 
dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
 A good opportunity for pursuing this type of linkage exists in Exposition 
Park. Over the next decade, at least $200 million in public investment will be 
made in the park with the building of a new Museum of Science and Industry, a 
science-oriented elementary school and a community center, renovating the Los 
Angeles Coliseum and Sports Arena, redoing the park's landscaping and improving 
traffic patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 The opportunity to forge a link between regional and community-based economic 
development strategies exists if policy makers think of Exposition Park as four 
parks in one: an events park consisting of the Coliseum and Sports Arena; a 
museum park containing the Museum of Science and Industry and the Natural 
History Museum; an educational park to surround the new elementary school and 
focus on the educational link between the school and the museums, and, finally, 
a community park whose major facilities will be a community center and swimming 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The first three parks conceptually link to regional strategies by virtue of 
the fact that their "customer base" is drawn from throughout Southern 
California. Historically, this has meant that decision making was focused 
primarily on serving regional needs -- sometimes to the detriment of local 
residents. Current challenges the regional strategists face are marketing these 
parks to even more regional customers and providing additional parking space. 
For community-based strategists, meanwhile, the challenge is to minimize 
adverse community impacts of traffic congestion created by regional users and 
at the same time derive direct economic and community benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 How can these strategies be synthesized? First, by recognizing that the 
community park can coexist with the regionally oriented parks. But for that to 
happen, the facilities serving community residents must be brought up to par 
with the existing venues. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, decisions affecting the community park should address local economic 
needs -- specifically employment and entrepreneurial opportunities for local 
residents -- in addition to providing enhanced recreation. After all, decisions 
relative to the Coliseum and the Sports Arena have been based as much on 
business and economics as on entertainment and recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, local groups such as the resident-owned Exposition Park Community 
Development Corp. must become active partners with the regional park advocates 
in seeking creative ways to market the parks to diverse users -- including 
solving parking problems. One suggestion advocated by community groups is 
closing portions of Figueroa Street between Exposition and Martin Luther King 
boulevards during major events. A new parking management concession for this 
"lot" could be community owned. Similarly, community-owned vending stalls could 
be allowed in the park, so local entrepreneurs could capitalize on the regional 
tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Little thinking has gone into how low-income residents in the Exposition Park 
neighborhood can become direct beneficiaries of major public investments in the 
park. Until more attention is given to forging links between regional and local 
initiatives, the gap between low-income neighborhoods and the region as a whole 
will continue to widen.

HMO PREMIUMS? COME ON, GET REAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times provides a much needed service to the community by printing articles 
like "Informed Consent: Business, Consumers Are Getting Savvier About Choosing 
Health Plans" (Oct. 16) which help people easily understand the four basic 
kinds of health plans that are available. However, I think that if you could 
use more realistic figures in your examples, the articles would make an even 
greater impact. 
</P>
<P>
 I know your example is hypothetical, but the annual cost figures you give I 
just don't think are obtainable in Los Angeles County. Example: for an HMO you 
show premiums of $1,308 per year. Realistic figures would be in the $4,000 to 
$6,000 range. Quite a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to ask you where I can get similar good coverage for $1,308 -- or 
even $2,308. But I know that figures like those do not exist for Los Angeles 
County and probably any other county in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 I think we still have a ways to go with health insurance reform in the United 
States. I feel strongly that the more accurate information the people are able 
to get, the better the final outcome will be.

IN THE GARDEN: FALL IS THE BEST TIME TO PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, TIMES GARDEN EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While working in the front yard the other day, a neighbor told me about the 
new raised beds he'd built over the summer in his back yard, sadly concluding, 
"Too bad it's too late to plant." 
</P>
<P>
 Whoa! Not true! Why do you think I'm digging up the yard right now? It's 
actually the perfect time to plant, and the perfect weather to do it in. 
</P>
<P>
 It's sunny, warm and breezy, and usually pleasant enough at this time of the 
year to keep you from working up a sweat, even if you're trying to dig up tree 
roots the size of Volkswagens in preparation for planting. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, from October through December is the best time to plant just about 
anything. Not just seasonal things like lettuce and pansies, but trees, shrubs, 
ground covers, herbs, bulbs and especially native plants and drought-resistant 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 It's far easier to list the exceptions to the "fall is the best time" rule -- 
roses and fruit trees are more plentiful and considerably cheaper in January, 
and some tropicals, such as bougainvillea, citrus and hibiscus, are better 
planted as the weather warms up in May or June. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, there are those seasonal things, many planted in fall, but 
others, such as petunias and tomatoes, planted in spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Planted now, trees and shrubs have the time to grow a substantial root system 
in the warm autumn soil, and a low sun and winter rains will help, making life 
easier because you won't have to water as often. So much easier that it's just 
about the only time of the year I do plant (except for those seasonal things). 
</P>
<P>
 When spring comes the plant is able to sustain the growth that naturally 
explodes at that time of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 If you wait until spring to plant, growth will be less sure-footed, and there 
will be less of it. You also will need to spend a lot more time watering, and 
use a good deal more water in summer because the roots of new plants won't 
reach very far into the soil, so they'll still be dependent on you or the 
sprinklers. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefits of fall planting are especially true for native and other 
drought-resistant plants. Without all the root growth made in fall and winter, 
the plants are going to need frequent watering in summer, which makes them 
susceptible to various root rots brought on by over-watering. You will be 
walking a thin line between too much and too little water, a line too easily 
crossed. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why you'll see so many native plant sales listed during the autumn 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be discouraged by what you see at nurseries or plant sales. Most plants 
do not look their best right now, but put them in the ground and give them a 
few months and they'll burst forth come spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Seasonal plants, listed in the box on this page, can only be planted in the 
fall because they require cool weather to grow in and they bloom or mature 
during spring's warming days. The vegetables are called the "cool-weather 
crops" and the flowers are called "spring flowers," as opposed to "summer 
flowers." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to modern nursery practices, you can also plant these flowers in very 
early spring (late February and March) from larger nursery containers and still 
get a respectable show, but it will be short. Planted now, some of these 
fall-planted flowers will bloom all winter and spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Flowers sold in small packs are the best buy now because they have plenty of 
time to grow in fall and early winter, though if you are really in a hurry for 
color, you can plant from the larger "color packs" or from 4-inch pots (these 
are the best bets in early spring). 
</P>
<P>
 Don't overlook sowing things from seed. There are many handsome spring flowers 
unattainable any other way. Wildflowers, for one. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also plant bulbs and some nurseries are brim full of them. All can go 
into the ground right away, except tulips. In our mild climate, tulips need 
some chilling in your refrigerator. About six weeks should do it, though many 
good tulip growers wait until the end of December to plant, doing the work over 
the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember that tulips and many other traditional East Coast bulbs bloom for a 
very short time in Southern California, a week, or two at the most, while many 
of the unusual mild climate bulbs, such as freesias and sparaxis, or ranunculus 
and watsonias, bloom for a month or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulips are also a one-shot bulb; they will not bloom a second year and, after 
they bloom, you should pull them out before the foliage disappears and you 
can't find them. 
</P>
<P>
 The mild-climate bulbs, on the other hand, are quite at home here and bloom 
year after year and even multiply (though many gardeners start fresh with 
ranunculus each fall since they are likely to rot if left in over the summer). 
</P>
<P>
 The cole crops are king of the fall, winter and spring vegetable garden -- 
broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage and cauliflower (and kohlrabi). 
</P>
<P>
 All are easy enough to grow and do best planted from nursery packs or from 
transplants that you've raised yourself. That's because broccoli and 
cauliflower, in particular, tend to have a crook between roots and leaves that 
should be buried underground when you plant, or the plants will not stand up 
straight. Pull off the bottom two leaves and plant so that crook is 
underground. It's similar to planting a tomato deep. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a good idea to dust on some B.T., a non-poisonous biological control for 
the cabbage worms that relish all the cole crops. Do it right after planting if 
you've seen the white butterflies, the adults, fluttering around your garden 
laying eggs. Snails also love these fall-planted vegetables, so watch for them. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also plant most of the leaf and root crops, such as spinach or beets 
(and most Oriental vegetables). All are best grown from seed that sprouts 
quickly in the warm autumn weather. Fall Planting Guide

NOTHING BUT BLUE SKIES; AFTER HIS TONY-WINNING SUCCESS WITH 'TOMMY,' DES 
MCANUFF IS HEADED FOR WORLDS BEYOND THE LA JOLLA PLAYHOUSE. HIS REVIVAL OF 'HOW 
TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING' IS BOUND FOR BROADWAY. HIS NEXT 
STOP: HOLLYWOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a gorgeous day, and the Pacific is so close that surf noises are 
distracting. Director Des McAnuff is sitting in his living room, doors flung 
open to the sea, explaining why he really isn't leaving La Jolla and the 
theater he's turned into a major national contender. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that last year he announced he was concluding 12 years as artistic 
director of the La Jolla Playhouse to become its "director-in-residence." And 
put all those movie deals you keep hearing about in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not leaving the Playhouse," insists the man best known for sending "The 
Who's Tommy" on to popular and critical acclaim. "I'm not going anywhere. I'm 
just changing jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Call it what you will, but all his moves are high profile now. Last year, 
42-year-old McAnuff received his second Tony, for directing "Tommy." (His first 
was for "Big River" in 1985.) "Tommy" is currently on a national tour and will 
soon open productions in both Toronto, where McAnuff grew up, and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The rock musical's success lifted McAnuff to star status. Now, in his first 
directorial outing since "Tommy," he's doing "How to Succeed in Business 
Without Really Trying," a revival of the 1961 musical sendup of corporate 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "How to Succeed" opens here today with plans for a Broadway opening in March. 
And although McAnuff doesn't officially leave his La Jolla post until early 
November, he's already got film projects cooking with both Disney and Warner 
Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the list of film and theater projects McAnuff's working on right now 
could give many people Excedrin headaches, but the energetic writer, director 
and musician does not seem at all intimidated. Asked to explain the weight that 
each project has for him in comparison to the next, he throws up his hands: 
They're all great. 
</P>
<P>
 He's working on an animated film project with "Tommy" collaborator Pete 
Townshend. While he is contracted to direct one play a year in La Jolla, 
McAnuff has also bought a loft space in New York's TriBeCa, finished his first 
movie -- a short called "Bad Dates" -- and made the trade press for dropping 
out of a full-length feature on James Dean. 
</P>
<P>
 McAnuff was brought in to direct the Dean biography for Warner Bros. starring 
Leonardo DiCaprio, and did a well-received rewrite with "Malcolm X" producer 
Marvin Worth. But McAnuff left the project earlier this month, citing 
"scheduling" problems. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Dean' is a project that could heat up very quickly," the director explains. 
"At this stage, it would have been impossible to fulfill all of my other 
responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman at Warner Bros., which put McAnuff up for several months in a West 
Hollywood apartment to work on projects, says pretty much the same thing. 
Acknowledging the director's assorted theater assignments, for instance, the 
spokesman says, "We're grateful to Des for his contribution to the James Dean 
project (and) hope to continue our excellent relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, "in active development" at Disney is the live-action "Monster 
Musical," which is just starting up and, apparently, easier for McAnuff to 
devote time to. He and producer Worth wrote an 85-page treatment -- McAnuff 
calls it a "little novella" -- based on an idea of Worth's, and composer Alan 
Menken was originally involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Movies are mainly about conveying ideas, storytelling and working with 
actors, which I have spent the last 20 years of my life doing," says McAnuff, 
who already looks pretty Hollywood with his properly torn jeans, leather jacket 
and maroon sports car. "In many ways, it seems like a very natural transition." 
</P>
<P>
 First, however, comes "How to Succeed." About $900,000 of its $1.3-million 
budget here is "enhancement" money from commercial producers, and New 
York-based producer Michael David at Dodger Productions expects a $5-million 
price tag by the time the show opens on Broadway after its run here and at the 
Kennedy Center in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McAnuff's choice to take a familiar musical to Broadway comes at a time when 
expectations could hardly be higher. Not only is he riding the crest of 
"Tommy," but his "How to Succeed" will follow and probably be competing with 
acclaimed revivals of "Show Boat," "Carousel" and "Damn Yankees." 
</P>
<P>
 "How to Succeed" was crafted by a team including Frank Loesser and Abe 
Burrows, the men best known for "Guys and Dolls" (whose long-running Broadway 
revival closes in January). There have already been about 2,700 other amateur 
and professional productions of "How to Succeed" in the United States alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Winner of both the Tony for best musical and the Pulitzer for drama, "How to 
Succeed" originally ran more than three years on Broadway at the 46th St. 
Theatre -- now the Richard Rodgers Theatre, where it is also expected to play 
during this revival -- and was made into a film in 1967. Based on the 
best-selling novel by Shepherd Mead, who died last August, "How to Succeed" 
lampoons a corporate America where coffee breaks are celebrated, and deception 
never hurts. 
</P>
<P>
 The original production and film made Robert Morse a star; this time, Matthew 
Broderick plays J. Pierrepont Finch, an upwardly mobile window-washer with an 
eye on the executive suite. Rocketing up the corporate ladder at the World Wide 
Wicket Co., Finch is guided by such credos as handling a disaster by keeping a 
cool head and putting the blame on somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
 'How to Succeed" is obviously less groundbreaking than "Tommy," and McAnuff's 
longtime agent, Gilbert Parker, thinks there's nothing wrong with that. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is at a point where he can do something that appeals to him, and the idea 
of working with Matthew Broderick on a Frank Loesser show is something very few 
people would turn down. He doesn't have to take risks every time." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, it's fun. Plopped in a San Diego rehearsal room, fresh from a run and 
workout, McAnuff laughs at every run-through of a song spoofing suburbia, then 
calls the whole show "inspired lunacy." And he hints that classic musical or 
not, he's planning some nice surprises onstage. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 23 actors in the show (plus the voice of Walter Cronkite, the show's 
narrator), and McAnuff keeps them very busy. Instead of simple scene changes, 
for instance, the director frequently fills his stage with people and action. 
The story takes place in a New York skyscraper, and McAnuff says all the 
activity "evokes a sense of the harried pressure and frenetic work energy of an 
office tower." 
</P>
<P>
 Staging concepts aren't all that different from those of "Tommy," comments 
choreographer Wayne Cilento. "Des has a little bit of a signature on his 
style," says Cilento, who also worked on "Tommy." "It's a very smart take on 
the period, and it's classy." 
</P>
<P>
 McAnuff's style is also well-rooted in research. Even when working on musicals 
like "How to Succeed," and on his 1990 production of "A Funny Thing Happened on 
the Way to the Forum," he and his team do the same sort of dramaturgical work 
they might do on Chekhov or Brecht.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's possible and perhaps mandatory to have a contemporary point of view," 
says McAnuff. "You don't simply have to obediently re-create something." 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestration on "How to Succeed" is different, and production numbers are 
re-conceived. But McAnuff did not tamper with the book. "I think it would 
almost be like rewriting George Bernard Shaw or Shakespeare," McAnuff says, 
"because of the particular times they lived in. And at a certain point, that 
becomes desecration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Loesser and Burrows (who wrote the musical's book with Jack Weinstock 
& Willie Gilbert) were very hip people. They're not promoting (suburban bliss). 
They're satirizing it. It's definitely a scathing (and) enlightened attack, if 
not on the lives we lead today, then on the lives that parented the lives we 
lead today." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first time the La Jolla Playhouse planned from the start to take a 
musical to Broadway, McAnuff says. "When we did 'Tommy,' we weren't sure. On 
this, in part because of Matthew's participation and because it's post-'Tommy,' 
there's confidence that we'll send the piece on." 
</P>
<P>
 M cAnuff's track record is good. By the time he was 25, a dozen plays, 
musicals and scores he'd written had been produced either in Canada or in this 
country, where he's been living since 1976. He is also one of six partners in 
Dodger Productions, a group of buddies who've teamed up for nearly 20 years and 
who earlier backed the director's "Big River."  
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, McAnuff wrote, directed and composed music for "The Death of Von 
Richthofen as Witnessed From Earth" at New York Shakespeare Festival's Public 
Theater. Featuring such special effects as a flying piano, it got him tagged a 
Wunderkind in Newsweek and cemented his appeal to La Jolla Playhouse board 
members who flew in to see it before hiring him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He already had the stamp of genius about him," recalls Dr. Willard P. 
VanderLaan, the longtime Playhouse board member who headed the original search 
committee. "He was just turning 30. He was a very good risk for a new theater 
that wanted to be bold and innovative." 
</P>
<P>
 The Playhouse reopened under McAnuff's direction in 1983 after languishing 
almost two decades. Mel Ferrer, Dorothy McGuire and Gregory Peck founded the 
place in 1947, and McAnuff brought in such actors as Bill Irwin and Holly 
Hunter. Guest directors have included Peter Sellars, whose production of 
Brecht's "The Visions of Simone Machard" reopened the Playhouse, and James 
Lapine, who came here with Stephen Sondheim in 1985 to rework "Merrily We Roll 
Along."  
</P>
<P>
 But by the end of the '80s, McAnuff began to get restless. And as early as 
1990, he started talking with VanderLaan and other board members about moving 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't so much that I didn't enjoy the job," he says today, "but if you're 
going to do it well, you have to be around. We have always been hands-on 
producers, and when you're standing behind not only your own work but maybe the 
work of four or five other directors in the course of a season, it requires a 
lot of time and energy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Playhouse's eclectic artistic policy has allowed him to go from musicals 
to classics to contemporary drama, but he concedes the administrative duties 
were wearing him down. And although he's just 42, he speaks of wanting to turn 
the place over to younger artists who could have a shot at the opportunities he 
and his contemporaries had here in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 After "Tommy," McAnuff says, he saw greater financial and staff stability at 
the Playhouse and felt the place could manage without him. And his successor is 
35-year-old New York-based free-lance director Michael Greif, a graduate of UC 
San Diego's theater graduate program whom McAnuff has both known and worked 
with for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I actually had this job for considerably longer than I intended," McAnuff 
says. "I'm really proud of this theater and its accomplishments, but I'm glad 
to have my freedom. It's really great to have my wings back." 
</P>
<P>
 F riends and colleagues indicate little surprise at his film inter ests. "We 
have this kind of friendship where each wants what the other has," comments 
director Lapine. "The summer I was there doing 'Luck, Pluck & Virtue,' Des 
said, 'You made movies.' And I said, 'You have the Broadway gusher.' Now he's 
going to make movies, and he'll see what he's been missing." 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, McAnuff indicates he already knows. "As a stage director, what you 
really have to learn to celebrate is your own lack of control. But there's 
something really exciting about taking many of those same elements -- actors, 
story, hopefully great language, strong ideas, important themes and subjects -- 
and being able to lock something in."  
</P>
<P>
 Films are something he's had on hold for at least a decade, McAnuff points 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before he came to La Jolla, he says, there was talk about making a film 
of "The Death of Von Richthofen." And early on in La Jolla, he'd even hoped to 
develop an ensemble company equally at home onstage or in cinema. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Townshend have been talking for a while, he says, about an animated 
version of "The Iron Man" based on Ted Hughes' popular children's book. 
Townshend did a stage musical of "The Iron Man" at London's Young Vic last year 
and an album in 1989, but McAnuff says this will be a new incarnation. They are 
now "in discussions" with a studio on it, he says.  
</P>
<P>
 McAnuff is coy about the Disney live action musical, saying only that it is 
"about a young girl, set in Transylvania." But Disney sources add that the 
young girl goes on a fantasy journey to Transylvania where she meets and 
befriends a set of monsters who are misunderstood and unappreciated by local 
inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
 McAnuff's also involved in developing a smaller film called "A Sudden 
Darkness" by Canadian writer Hugh Graham. It takes place in '70s suburban 
Toronto, around where McAnuff grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he's already directed "Bad Dates," a 29-minute film for Touchstone. 
Starring Nancy Travis, it is about a kindergarten teacher with bad luck dating 
and children who begin to eat inanimate objects. McAnuff considers the film, 
which is scheduled to play in a short film festival in Paris in January, not 
just black comedy but "magic realism." 
</P>
<P>
 The longtime musician also wants to do more composing. There are five guitars 
(including one Townshend gave him) in the beachside apartment McAnuff shares 
with his wife, Susan Berman, an actress he married on the Playhouse stage in 
1984 (under a portrait of George Orwell), and their 4-year-old daughter, Julia. 
</P>
<P>
 McAnuff wrote some music for "Bad Dates" and did so occasionally for the 
Playhouse as well. But he felt awkward writing for the theater here, he says, 
and wanting more time to write was another incentive to moving on. "Before I 
came here, I was always comfortable about changing hats," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He expects to be in La Jolla at least three months a year, and he and Greif 
are already talking about next season. Possibilities include directing a 
revival of Julian Barry's play "Lenny," a project McAnuff and former Lenny 
Bruce manager Worth have been talking about for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 H e will "absolutely" continue fund-raising for the Play house, McAnuff says, 
concentrating on such things as a capital campaign and building an endowment 
and cash reserve. And he also will entertain theater offers elsewhere, saying: 
"What's nice is that I've been getting offers from really hip companies, ones I 
thought might have forgotten I existed."  
</P>
<P>
 On his long-term dream list is a presentation of Shakespeare's tetralogy, 
"Richard II" through "Henry IV," and he says he's also often flirted with the 
idea of doing his Public Theater hit, "The Death of von Richthofen," here. But 
at the moment, he confesses, "I'm not itching to do another theater piece." 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't seem to worry successor Greif, however. "Des has real roots and 
real heart connected to this place," says Greif. "It's realistic that we are 
going to have scheduling complications at times, but I think we're all 
dedicated to making it work. Des loves the theater and he loves our theater."*

A LITTLE SONG, A LITTLE DANCE; MATTHEW BRODERICK'S IMMEDIATE FUTURE IS A BIT OF

 "I don't know what I was thinking -- I thought I could whip off a musical in 
between shooting and editing a film," Matthew Broderick says with a laugh 
during a break in the second week of rehearsals for the La Jolla Playhouse 
revival of "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying," which opens 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like I either have more work than I can handle or none at all, and 
I've been on a roll since 'The Night We Never Met.' 
</P>
<P>
 "A roll, of course, can be a positive thing or a boulder going downhill," adds 
the 32-year-old actor, who also has featured roles in Alan Parker's "The Road 
to Wellville," which opened Friday, and Alan Rudolph's "Mrs. Parker and the 
Vicious Circle," out Dec. 21 in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 As if that weren't enough, Broderick is also making his directorial debut this 
year with "Infinity" -- a film in which he also stars -- about Nobel 
Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman, based on a script by Broderick's 
mother, Patricia Broderick. "Infinity," which also stars Patricia Arquette, 
wrapped in early September, leaving Broderick just enough time to catch a plane 
to San Diego to begin rehearsals for "How to Succeed." When the musical closes 
on Dec. 4, Broderick will race to Los Angeles to spend six weeks editing 
"Infinity," then it's off to Washington, where previews for "How to Succeed" 
begin Jan. 28. That will be followed by an engagement of the play on Broadway, 
where it is to open March 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying," a scathing attack on 
corporate America based on the 1952 best-selling novel by Shepherd Mead, finds 
Broderick cast as J. Pierrepont Finch, an unctuous young man who approaches 
brown-nosing as an art form. The musical, with music and lyrics by Frank 
Loesser, opened on Broadway in 1961 and made a star of Robert Morse, who also 
starred in David Swift's 1967 movie of the play. 
</P>
<P>
 The part demands a lot of Broderick, who is called upon to sing and dance 
onstage for the first time as he portrays a character who could easily come off 
as repulsive if not given the proper shading. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that he has a daunting year of work stretching ahead of him may 
account in part for Broderick's subdued demeanor at today's rehearsal. This 
isn't to say that Broderick isn't up to the job; when director Des McAnuff 
gives the signal and the cast springs into action, Broderick lights up like a 
Christmas tree. 
</P>
<P>
 He is, however, clearly a man who knows not to squander his energy, to speak 
softly, pay attention and give what is asked of him with as much precision as 
possible. He is, in short, a team player, and the team he's working with here 
seems quite fond of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Matthew is a total delight, and I'm having a great time with him," says 
McAnuff, a director known for his ability to breathe new life into threadbare 
material. "I felt no trepidation at all about his ability to carry a musical, 
either, because he has a beautiful singing voice and he's a tremendous actor. 
The greatest performances in musicals have generally come from actors, not from 
singers who act, and he's done tremendously well so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bobby Morse gave one of the great performances of the time in the original 
production, but Matthew brings a different style of comedy to the role," 
McAnuff continues. "He has a truthful acting style that elevates the play, he's 
mercurial, impish and bold in his comedy choices, and he infuses the play with 
sophistication and charm. Without a lot of charm, this character wouldn't be 
interesting. Matthew has charm to burn, but he's also a man of substance, which 
the character he's playing definitely is not. . . . An actor needs some 
distance from his material, and the fact that Matthew is so unlike Finch is 
part of what makes him great for the part." 
</P>
<P>
 A fascination with Finch isn't what attracted Broderick to the play. He's 
here, he says, simply because "I've always wanted to do a musical and was 
attracted to this one because it's really funny and it has great songs." 
</P>
<P>
 "Bobby Morse got discovered with this play, and people keep saying to me, 'He 
was such a phenomenon in the part; aren't you afraid to try to follow him?' " 
adds the actor, nibbling at the tuna sandwich that will sustain him through 
five more hours of vigorous rehearsing. (One would imagine he'd be training 
like an athlete for this grueling role, but he says he's just relying on lots 
of coffee to get through the day.) "My career isn't gonna end or be made on 
this play, because I'm a known entity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always wanted to sing and took loads of voice lessons before we started 
because I had a lot of apprehension about it. I tried to do some singing for 
'The Lion King' (Broderick was the voice of Simba), and after three attempts 
they fired me and got somebody who sounded like me to do the singing. That 
didn't do much for my confidence. Then my singing teacher, Keith Davis, died 
four days before we started rehearsing." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the play is obviously a creative risk for Broderick in many ways, the 
real risk it presents lies in the fact that the boyish, bubbly Finch has a lot 
in common with Ferris Bueller, the title character in the 1986 film "Ferris 
Bueller's Day Off." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've almost gotten past being typecast as Ferris Bueller, but this 
play isn't going to help that, because it's basically the same role. 
Nonetheless, if I have to put a gun to their heads, audiences will accept me in 
adult roles," he says with a laugh. "Actually, adult roles are the only thing 
I've done for the past few years -- nobody's noticed though, because none of 
them have been too successful." 
</P>
<P>
 True, Broderick has been playing adults of late, but they've all been adults 
of a certain type. What type might that be? Nice is a word that comes to mind. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't consciously avoided playing evil characters or being in violent 
films, but I tend to not like those scripts when I read them and don't like 
seeing those kinds of films," he says. "I think I could play evil characters, 
but the way this business works is, if you're successful at something, 
everybody wants you to keep doing it again -- you know: 'Let's get that Ferris 
Bueller guy.' A couple of times I've been sent evil characters, but even then, 
they're usually lovable boyish types who happen to murder women." 
</P>
<P>
 Broderick does move in a slightly darker direction, though, in "Mrs. Parker 
and the Vicious Circle," Alan Rudolph's revisionist view of writer Dorothy 
Parker and the other legendary New York wits of the Algonquin Round Table. 
Broderick, cast as writer Charles MacArthur, a notorious rake who broke 
Parker's heart, employs his boyish charm here to suggest something dark and 
manipulative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charles isn't evil, but he's weak; he's a cad basically and is an alcoholic, 
as everybody in the film is. This should be a winner -- a bunch of suicidal 
alcoholics," Broderick says with a laugh. "Anyhow, getting the part was a nice 
break for me because I don't usually get these kinds of roles." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Rudolph of his decision to cast Broderick: "I wanted Matthew for the part 
because he's never played a rogue before, but I knew he had it in him. He 
really delivered too. People who see the film invariably tell me, somewhat 
surprised, 'Gee, Matthew's so sexy.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He has it in him to be one of the most rounded acting talents of his 
generation; he has the depth and charm of the classic Hollywood legends. He was 
a huge star before he was 25 years old, and we've just seen the tip of the 
iceberg of what he's capable of." 
</P>
<P>
 Broderick's character in "The Road to Wellville" -- the film based on the 
novel of the same name by T. C. Boyle -- is more in keeping with parts he has 
played before. The fictionalized account of life at the San, a health clinic 
built in Battle Creek, Mich., at the turn of the century by corn flake magnate 
John Harvey Kellogg, finds Broderick cast as Will Lightbody, a sexually 
frustrated husband with a gullible, gorgeous wife played by Bridget Fonda, who 
leads him around by the nose. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a reactive role, but it had so much to react to," Broderick says of Will 
Lightbody. "I envisioned the character as a whining 5-year-old who was always 
throwing tantrums. In fact, I have a picture of myself making a painting when I 
was 5 years old, and I have paint dripping all over my legs and look like a 
crazy man -- I wanted some of that in this performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker wanted Broderick not so much for ability to telegraph craziness but 
because, he says, "Matthew's capable of great subtlety, and you never see the 
joints in his acting. He brought a gentleness to this part too that was better 
than how it was written, and I think that's a big part of why he's a movie star 
-- there's a gentleness to Matthew that people simply like. I hate to gush, but 
he really is an extraordinary gentleman and is a delight to work with. He's 
extremely unspoiled considering that he's been doing this since he was very 
young." 
</P>
<P>
 Broderick was born in New York City in 1962, the youngest of three children. 
He essentially grew up in the theater: His father, James Broderick, was an 
actor, and his mother, Patricia (Biow) Broderick, a playwright and director. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had an arty upbringing," he says. "My mother is well read, so the 
conversation in the house was pretty cultured, and I went to the theater when 
my father was in it. We went to museums a lot; I spent time in Europe, and for 
a period I considered becoming an artist -- I used to love drawing and still 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially I thought I might want to have some kind of backstage job because 
the first thing I fell in love with was the environment of the theater more 
than acting itself. I was a shy kid who didn't like being the center of 
attention. Well, actually, part of me loved it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first movie that made an impression on me was Charlie Chaplin's 'Modern 
Times.' I thought it was hilarious and romantic and loved everything about it. 
I idolized Chaplin and loved the way he moved -- in fact, I used to make 
paintings of him. I started out wanting to be a comedic actor, and it never 
occurred to me to also pursue directing, as Chaplin did. And now, having done 
it, I'd think twice before attempting it again. Making 'Infinity' was rough, 
and I barely got through it." 
</P>
<P>
 After he graduated from high school in 1980, Broderick auditioned for Uta 
Hagen at Herbert Berghof's H.B. Studio in New York City. He was accepted, and 
that year he made his theater debut in an Off-Broadway production of Horton 
Foote's "On Valentine's Day," playing opposite his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was terrified and wasn't very good. It was my first play, and I had trouble 
acting with my father -- I couldn't get past the fact that my father was 
yelling at me in this Southern accent," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Broderick must have been better than he remembers because things happened fast 
for him after that. In 1981 he was cast in Harvey Fierstein's "Torch Song 
Trilogy," and the year after that his career really took off. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1982 I did Neil Simon's 'Brighton Beach Memoirs' on Broadway, and when it 
was opening, my first movie, 'Max Dugan Returns,' came out," he recalls. "That 
film wasn't too successful, but then 'WarGames,' which was successful, came out 
right when I won the Tony for 'Brighton Beach' in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "One would assume I look back on this as a great time, but this was all 
happening around the time my father died, so mostly it was a terrible time for 
me," he says softly. "I was very close to my father, and I found out he was 
dying the night of the first preview of 'Torch Song Trilogy.' Then when I was 
shooting 'WarGames' and 'Max Dugan Returns' in L.A., I was flying back weekends 
to be with him. 
</P>
<P>
 I guess I dealt with his death by staying busy, but I don't know. . . . Would 
it have been better not to work and to have been home all the time? I hoped 
he'd like seeing that his son was going to make a living, and he was very 
excited about 'Brighton.' This sounds like a movie, but he managed to live 
until I had the first reading of the play and called him from L.A. and told him 
it had gone well. He died the next night (Nov. 1, 1982). 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how it changed me, losing him. I've thought about that a lot, 
and I think it made me shut down for a long time. A big part of my life was 
just not dealt with because I couldn't deal with it, and it took a couple of 
years for me to even admit what had happened and get upset about it. It's funny 
what time does, though. It's been 12 years since my father died, and you kind 
of get over it even without knowing you are. It just sort of fades away, which 
is sad." 
</P>
<P>
 Broderick completed 10 films in the next eight years, all of which were 
successful enough to keep him in the game. His stock went up considerably in 
1986 with the release of "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," and he got the co-star of 
his life in 1990 when he was cast opposite Marlon Brando in the Andrew Bergman 
comedy "The Freshman." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I met Marlon Brando, I was pretty shaken up for a while, but I got over 
that and just grew to adore him. He was great," says Broderick, who turned in 
what many consider the best performance of his career in that film. 
</P>
<P>
 Broderick made "The Freshman" after a serious automobile accident in Ireland 
in 1987. He suffered a severely broken leg and other injuries when the car he 
was driving collided with another, killing its two occupants. Broderick was 
charged with manslaughter and reckless driving but was cleared of both. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel more like an adult now," he says, reflecting on how the accident 
affected him. "Obviously, it was extremely difficult coming to grips with what 
happened, but in time I felt better about that terrible experience. I went to a 
therapist, and he helped. Unfortunately, my therapist died of cancer about a 
year after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've experienced a lot of death," he adds, "but experiencing it doesn't make 
you any more comfortable with it. I wish I had some holy, accepting attitude 
about it, but I don't -- I just wish it didn't happen. Yes, you get over it and 
move on, but you're not the same and they're not there. They're really not 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 O ne would assume that trau matic experiences of this sort are made doubly 
difficult by being in the public eye, however, Broderick appears to have made 
peace with the vagaries of life as a public figure. "Fame has a life of its own 
that has little to do with the person himself: We're like fictional characters 
that get into peoples' consciousness, and I don't see that as good or bad. 
That's just the way it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have been staring at me when I'm in public for about 10 years and I've 
learned to tune it out, but I have no idea how it's affected my personality. At 
first it was exciting, then for a while it pissed me off and I was nasty to 
people, and now I'm a blank -- I'm polite but I don't connect to anybody. It's 
ironic, because when people approach me, they usually want to tell me they like 
my work, and that's exactly what you want. But something inside shuts down that 
prevents you from being engaged by those encounters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an occupational hazard that once you become famous you become cut off 
from normal life. I see films sometimes where two movie stars are in the 
supermarket shopping, and I think to myself, 'Wow, she probably hasn't been in 
a supermarket in years.' 
</P>
<P>
 "People who don't know me often assume I have a swollen head, and I find 
myself endlessly trying to prove I'm normal. The most widely held misconception 
about famous actors is that they're all in love with themselves -- lots of 
actors are extremely self-conscious. My girlfriend (actress Sarah Jessica 
Parker) goes to the gym and comes home moaning that she's out of shape, and she 
has a beautiful body." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of Parker, how come she keeps talking to the media about her struggle 
to get the actor to marry her? 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it when she does that," he says wryly. "I don't know why she does that 
-- want to call her? It's become a shtick almost. My love life is fine, but I'm 
not gonna blab about it. I'll leave that to Sarah." 
</P>
<P>
 In parting, one asks Broderick what he feels is the most rewarding part of all 
the work with which he is currently deluged. What's the payoff? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a rush from being the new guy, which is what happened for me in '82 
with 'Brighton Beach,' " he replies after a long, thoughtful pause. "I loved 
the part; I felt fully used and could sense myself flying into something. I'd 
get huge laughs and big applause -- I just felt great. But after you've done 
this work for a while, you have to find your fun in a different place because 
you're no longer anybody's 'discovery' and you're probably gonna get your fair 
share of negative criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to love the work itself, and I do -- it's my life really," he says. 
"I can remember the first play I did when I was 15. Nervous as I was onstage, I 
could feel I belonged there. This isn't to say I'm the best actor in the world, 
but I do know that I'm an actor."

COOL HAND LUCAS; ON A PATH THAT LED FROM COPENHAGEN TO NEW YORK'S LOWER EAST 
SIDE, NEWCOMER LUCAS IS PROVING THE RAP MAY HAVE BEEN BORN IN THE 'HOOD, BUT 
ITS GOT A GLOBAL APPEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It is late on a weeknight, and silence prevails in the dimly lit, fifth-floor 
hallway of the Hit Factory -- the renowned, midtown Manhattan recording studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the door to Studio A3 opens. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, a tall, slender young man with a round crew cut and a matching 5 
o'clock shadow stands in near-darkness behind a glass panel, grinning while he 
playfully babbles into an overhead microphone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Click, click, click, clock," pops and rolls off the tongue of 23-year-old 
rapper Lucas, the quirkiest arrival to hit the pop world since Beck unleashed 
his loser's litany at the beginning of the year. Lucas is preparing to record 
vocals for a song he's recording for director Nora Ephron to consider using in 
her upcoming film, "Mixed Nuts." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ah-one-two, ah-one-two," he continues in his mid-range, New York-accented 
voice, jerking his shoulders back and forth and rhythmically bobbing his head. 
"What'cha gonna do when the L-U-C is comin' after you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas' antics, while breaking up the engineer at the soundboard on the other 
side of the glass, might lead an outsider to believe he has flipped his lid. 
</P>
<P>
 He has. 
</P>
<P>
 And so have multitudes of listeners and viewers across the United States, 
Canada and Europe who have heard his catchy, left-field hit "Lucas With the Lid 
Off" and seen its illusionist, black-and-white video. 
</P>
<P>
 The energetic and cerebral single, which combines ragtime jazz horns and 
booming bass rhythms with reggae chatting, scat singing and strong rapping, is 
an across-the-board smash. Drawn from Lucas' new album "Lucacentric," it is 
soaring up the nation's pop, rap and modern rock charts. ( See review, Page 
70.)  
</P>
<P>
 While the hip-hop arena may seem like the most logical place to promote Lucas, 
his record company is also trying to cultivate an audience for him on the 
college and alternative scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt out of place when I heard the song on an alternative station after a 
Soup Dragons record," Lucas says with a chuckle, sitting at a console and 
pulling on the strings of his gray, hooded sweat shirt -- a hoody , in 
hip-hop-speak. His equally hip-hop blue-and-gold suede Puma sneakers lie on the 
other side of the console. "I just couldn't picture all these long-haired 
alternative rock kids listening to me." 
</P>
<P>
 That's because Lucas Secon, born in Copenhagen to a Corsican Danish mother and 
a Lithuanian American father, has had hip-hop culture flowing through his veins 
since he first visited New York in the summer of 1983, when he was 12. 
</P>
<P>
 His parents had recently divorced, and Lucas, an only child, was making the 
first of what would become annual summer visits to his father's home in 
Manhattan's Lower East Side. 
</P>
<P>
 That summer, and the next few after, "old school" hip-hop's golden age was 
flourishing. Break-dancing, graffiti art and block parties featuring rapping 
and deejay contests were all the rage with young people in many of New York's 
predominantly African American and Latino communities. When Lucas glimpsed 
elaborate graffiti murals on playground walls and saw spinning, twisting 
break-dancers bust their moves on pieces of cardboard on the sidewalk, he was 
hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas' steady immersion into hip-hop helped him break free from what he 
describes as Denmark's culturally restrictive grip. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a limited amount of creativity coming out of Copenhagen," he says. 
"There's a conformist mentality, and there's no room for a subculture. I love 
rap because it's uninhibited." 
</P>
<P>
 And when you're raised by a mother who's a surrealist painter and a father who 
for years wrote songs for the Mills Brothers, as Lucas was, a little thing like 
freedom of expression is vital. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie's Dance Studio in the East Village's Broadway/Lafayette section was 
Lucas' entree into the culture in which his career and life are so firmly 
entrenched. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Otero, who was then a member of a dance, rap and graffiti art group 
called the Scrambling Feet Crew, taught curious kids the acrobatics of 
break-dancing. After Lucas signed up for lessons, he gained a mentor and 
confidant. Otero, now an aspiring rapper and producer, remains a good friend of 
Lucas'. 
</P>
<P>
 "His father brought him in one day," Otero, 27, recalls. "There were hardly 
any other white kids who came down there. He was mad shy and he thought he 
didn't fit in. I told him to loosen up." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas soon did, especially after Otero brought him to his Lower East Side 
block and introduced him to his neighborhood friends. Together, they frequented 
some of the city's hippest dance and rap clubs, such as Roxy's and the Fun 
House. Otero would also bring Lucas to his apartment, where he'd school him in 
rapping, scratching, mixing and recording, using a microphone, tape deck, 
turntables and sequencer. 
</P>
<P>
 As Lucas raps on his song "Born," which he dedicates to Otero: "I used to have 
ideas, yo / But couldn't freak the sample technique / Had so many words / But I 
couldn't speak / Until my man Jeff set me free." 
</P>
<P>
 L ucas originally developed his love of music as a child, when the sounds of 
jazz giants Miles Davis, Clifford Brown and Benny Goodman wafted through his 
house from his father's record player. 
</P>
<P>
 When his father thought Lucas was old enough, he'd take him to Copenhagen jazz 
clubs to hear African American performers -- many of whom were ex-GIs who had 
just completed their tours of duty in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, then, big-band, be-bop and cool jazz styles are abundant on 
"Lucacentric." 
</P>
<P>
 "The music is always in my head," Lucas says. "Jazz is inspirational. Be-bop 
introduced syncopation and off-key notes, which I love to use." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas also loved writing poetry as a teen. In 1990, one year before he was 
signed to his first record contract, Lucas won one of Spin magazine's Golden 
Poet Awards for a piece he called "The Ice Age." 
</P>
<P>
 But his first album, "To Rap My World Around You," was met with an icy 
reception by American hip-hop fans, and his label, Uptown/MCA, subsequently 
dropped him from its roster. Discouraged, Lucas left for London in search of a 
more receptive audience. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, Lucas said he felt like "the muted trumpet" he describes in the 
"Lucacentric" song of that name -- someone who had the control of his image and 
style, from look to lyrics, usurped by record company executives. 
</P>
<P>
 B ut Lucas now admits that his debut album's flopping was partly his own 
fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last time I wasn't ready," he says. "I tried too hard to sound like Rakim (of 
the seminal rap group Eric B. & Rakim) and I didn't use the broad scope I 
represented." 
</P>
<P>
 How broad? 
</P>
<P>
 Check these "Lucacentric" flavors: a couple of spoken-word pieces accompanied 
by skeletal jazz arrangements; vintage big-band horns complemented by nifty ska 
and dancehall toasting by Jamaican vocalist Junior Dangerous, and cleverly 
crafted, poetic lyrics, expertly rapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas, who wrote, produced and arranged the entire album himself, uses song 
titles such as "The Statusphere," "Livin' in a Silicone Dream" and "Inflatable 
People" as metaphors for the record's essential themes -- the pitfalls of fast 
fame, the perils of instant gratification and record companies' fickle 
treatment of their artists. 
</P>
<P>
 The album's most ambitious track, "Spin the Globe," features guest rappers 
from Uganda, India and France rhyming in their native tongues, joining Otero 
and Lucas rapping in Spanish and English, respectively. The song contains more 
than 60 samples, including some played backward. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never do another song like that again," Lucas says, chuckling again. 
</P>
<P>
 Another of Lucas' defining characteristics, his exuberance, is reflected in 
his vocal impressions, when he growls and scats in the high and low registers. 
When this and equally vibrant music collide, some of his songs, such as 
"Inflatable People," sound like the soundtracks to colorful, comical cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
 As his manager, Chris Barstow, fondly says of his client, "He's hyperactive. 
His brain is always in overdrive." 
</P>
<P>
 S howmanship and charisma aside, Lucas also displays a savvy beyond his years. 
</P>
<P>
 On "Red, White and Blues," for example, he employs a dog-tired, beleaguered 
groan over a mid-tempo track to convey his disappointment with America's 
political climate. Using the metaphor of being victimized by an unfaithful 
girlfriend, he raps: "You said / 'Come over to my place / So we can make love / 
Yeah, so we can make love' / It spun my head / But when I got there / David 
Duke and Noriega were in your bed." 
</P>
<P>
 But experimental and adventurous music plus cunning lyrics -- no matter how 
slamming the beats are -- doesn't always garner the support of African American 
rap fans, the genre's largest and most influential constituency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if Lucas' record will hit hard with hip-hop's core audience," 
said Marcos Flores (a.k.a. Ronin Ro), a staff writer at the Source, the 
nation's leading rap journal. "The music is intriguing, but listeners want to 
cut to the chase. They want to know if an artist is 'ghetto' enough, if they 
are voicing their concerns. That's what Lucas is walking into." 
</P>
<P>
 Rappers such as Dream Warriors, Definition of Sound, Del the Funky Homosapien 
and Divine Styler are just a few performers whose critically acclaimed albums 
didn't earn big sales or get much radio or video airplay. 
</P>
<P>
 And Lucas must also contend with an additional stigma. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're white," says Otero, who is Puerto Rican, "you have a strike 
against you in the rap game because the black and Spanish people who started it 
might doubt that you're really down and that you've got skills. I told Lucas, 
'If you got skills, bring it on. Be true, be yourself and don't use gimmicks.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas' skills are obvious, and he's historically shared them with black 
artists, from his guest rap on Chubb Rock's 1991 song "Bring 'Em Home Safely" 
to his production of albums by Shara Nelson and Junior Dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sounds like he has the necessary resume," Flores says. "He's got to stay 
true to the core audience. Hopefully, his record company won't pass him off as 
the next Beck." 
</P>
<P>
 Barstow says that Black Entertainment Television has "Lucas With the Lid Off" 
in its regular rotation on its video music programs and that Lucas has been 
invited to perform at the ultimate proving ground, Harlem's Apollo Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas says he is confident about being embraced by African American audiences 
because he is true to the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing more insulting than someone who fronts about living in 
poverty and exploits someone else's culture," he says. "That's imperialism. If 
I exploited black culture, then I'd expect blacks to be prejudiced against me. 
But I respect other rappers and they respect me. How could the other artists 
I've worked with want to keep working with me if they thought I was an 
exploiter?"*

SHE DELIVERS MORE THAN A MESSAGE; KATIE MITCHELL IS LOOKING FOR THE 
INTERSECTION OF POLITICS AND PASSION IN THE CLASSICS SHE DIRECTS, AN APPROACH 
THAT HAS MADE HER A NEW FORCE ON THE BRITISH STAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lawrence Christon, Lawrence Christon is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Director Katie Mitchell's condensation of the Shakespearean trilogy "Henry VI" 
echoes Yeats' lament: "The best lack all conviction / while the worst are full 
of passionate intensity." Yeats could have been writing about gentle Henry and 
his eventual successor, the Machiavellian Richard III, in the complex 30-year 
struggle that made up the War of the Roses. But he was looking out over the 
20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 So is she. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do something in response to what's been happening in Bosnia and 
Rwanda," she says of the Royal Shakespeare Company production, which opened in 
London in July and comes to the Cerritos Performing Arts Center Tuesday as part 
of the UK/LA fest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world community has acted shamefully. We're gripped in a spiritual 
malaise and an emptiness of culture that's led to an unwillingness to take 
responsibility. You hear this awful phrase, 'compassion fatigue,' like it's a 
disease you have to cure yourself of. I wanted to remind the British 
particularly that we've been through two incredibly bloody civil wars of our 
own. We're not immune to it." 
</P>
<P>
 At 29, Mitchell is one of a handful of young directors causing a stir in the 
British theater scene; their number includes Stephen Daldry, Sam Mendes, 
Matthew Warchus and Deborah Warner. Mitchell is past president of the Oxford 
Theater Society, and while she's been on staff at the RSC since 1988, she still 
runs her own operation, Classics on a Shoestring. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her "Henry VI" is an examination, and a meditation as well, on familial ruin 
and on the theme that once a sword is dipped in blood, it can never be wiped 
clean. Nor will it easily be put to rest. And it asks, in effect, how can we 
forget the ghastliness of civil war without being doomed to see it repeated? 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell addresses these morally loaded questions with a political passion 
that roils through her entire conversation. For example, she has directed 
Garcia Lorca's "The House of Bernarda Alba" for Classics on a Shoestring. While 
it's become a classic study of a mother's ruthless tyranny over her daughters, 
cloaked in the veil of honor, Mitchell states that Lorca originally intended it 
to be a play about fathers and sons set in the Manichean starkness of Spanish 
culture and history, but political conditions made such a depiction dangerous 
in the extreme. (Not that it did any good; he was executed by Franco's rebels 
anyway, before the play ever made it to the stage.) 
</P>
<P>
 She says she wanted to show the affect of war on "The Trojan Women." "But 
Adrian (Noble, the RSC's artistic director) didn't think he could sell it." 
Artists of conscience and political engagement, such as Alexander Solzhenitsyn, 
crop up in conversation, as do references to Eastern Europe, where politics and 
theater breathe the same air. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe in art for art's sake," she says. "That leads to vanity. The 
fundamental question one should ask oneself is, 'What is my place of 
responsibility in the world community?' " 
</P>
<P>
 A small alarm goes off in the listener's back brain: Political theater, at 
least in America, is most of the time deadly theater. Agitprop. Wooden 
declamation. Preaching to the converted. No one cares to wait for Lefty 
anymore. Godot doesn't even get that many takers these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Her demeanor, moreover, reflects a didact's urgency. Her words tumble out in 
rushes and rapid swoops. Though her eyes are unwaveringly fixed on her 
listener, she often turns her face slightly away as she speaks. Is this 
intended to hide an even more voluble combativeness? Or does the gesture shield 
a fine artist's innate vulnerability? 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell began her directing career at age 19. When she joined the RSC as 
assistant director, Adrian Noble saw a young woman "full of vim and ideas, and 
passionate about how theater and society interface. She's a curious mix of 
anthropologist and artist. When she did 'The Dybbuk' for us, she conducted such 
an extraordinary eight- to 10-week rehearsal that by the end she transformed 
the company into Ukrainian Jews. And she's not Jewish. She's not bound by 
social realism. She's got theatrical poetry." 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I directed 'The Dybbuk' in 1991, I followed (playwright Solomon) 
Anski's footprints into the Ukraine," Mitchell says, sitting at the head of a 
large table in the Cerritos Performing Arts Center conference room. "The play 
says nothing of the Holocaust, but it foretold the Holocaust. Yet it remained 
this most beautiful love story, didn't it? Beautiful and sensual and deeply 
private." 
</P>
<P>
 She walked two fingers up her bare arm in a gesture depicting someone walking 
impishly along a strand -- the dybbuk so freely at home in its host that it can 
pleasurably take the air. Mitchell smiled the open smile of a woman in love. It 
was an extraordinarily precise and tender expression, free of any ideologue's 
stoniness. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's political awareness seems a more natural than acquired response to 
her surroundings, particularly as she describes an early childhood of noting 
her parents' friction points. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father is a working-class Cockney from the Midlands, and my mother's 
family owned what later became British Steel. They're both beautiful, but there 
were, ah, spirited differences in their political beliefs. He was a dentist but 
hated it; at 30 he discovered the arts and retired to found a private press 
called Libanus, which is one of the most important of its kind in the country. 
He was very keen that we should be arts-based." (Mitchell has a younger brother 
who's a photographer.) 
</P>
<P>
 The family divided its time between Berkshire in the home country, and a 
cottage in Wales. "He was on a self-sufficiency kick, so in Wales we lived off 
the land," Mitchell recalls. "We ate rabbits. I'm not an urban creature. I've 
been living in London seven years now and was at Oxford before that. But I 
think I'd be much happier in a rural society, which has made me very sensitive 
to light and sound. Nature is dominant in my work." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell started private school at 3 to satisfy her mother's political 
beliefs, and later moved to public school to satisfy those of her father. Then 
she went to an all-girls school in the south of England, and finished up the 
equivalent of an American high school level education at a coeducational 
institution, where her discovery of the theater corresponded to her growing 
realization that she'd never make it as a painter. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxford University followed, where she wrote radio plays and founded a feminist 
theater. A post-graduate grant afforded her a lengthy trip to Poland, Russia 
and Berlin, which brought all the hoped-for results -- a spiritual reconnection 
with her Eastern European forebears, and a chance to observe some of the 
Continent's leading theater practitioners up close, Andrzej Wajda and Heiner 
Muller of the Berliner Ensemble among them (she also visited the Moscow Art 
Theater). 
</P>
<P>
 The trip also enabled her to clarify her ideas on a working technique. "It's 
strictly egalitarian," she says. "In the first two weeks of rehearsal, no one 
does his part. We analyze. We take field trips. After that, we work on 
Stanislavsky-based objectives, which consist of understanding story conflict, 
of anti-emoting. He created a deeply pragmatic, sensible method and theory of 
acting. You just can't walk out into a space and convey meaning. You have to 
know the people you're working with; you have to know what your character 
thinks as well as what he does and says." 
</P>
<P>
 No one familiar with Mitchell or her work sees it forged in iron zealotry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I first met Katie in a corner cafe in St. Martins," says actress Jane 
Lapotaire, whom Mitchell cast as the lead in Ibsen's "Ghosts" (Lapotaire won a 
best actress Tony in New York for her 1981 portrayal of "Piaf"). "My first 
impression of her was that she's a beautiful woman. Steely gray eyes, no 
makeup, the physique of a ballet dancer. Later I saw that her wardrobe consists 
entirely of gray. She had beautiful long brown hair that she kept in a tight 
bun. I realized that she's a theater nun, ruthlessly dedicated to text. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got on because I'm about the age of her mother," Lapotaire continued. 
"Working with Katie, I've never been so closely walled in my head as an actor. 
She's ruthlessly loyal to the playwright, right down to punctuation. She'll do 
all the groundwork actors normally try to do themselves. She has a fine antenna 
for whether you're living in the line. She'll say, 'I think that was blurred a 
bit,' and you'll know right away that you've been relying on the actor's device 
instead of living the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "She also has a keenly developed aesthetic sense when it comes to lighting and 
sound. There were perhaps only five or six sound cues during the entire length 
of 'Ghosts.' A seagull's cry. A church bell. Their economy made them so potent, 
so potent."  
</P>
<P>
 Of politics in Mitchell's theater, Lapotaire says, "Katie may have been 
thinking of Bosnia when she staged 'Henry VI,' but she still set it in 
post-medieval England. Her first priority is to let the truth of the play speak 
for itself. I'd say her trademarks are economy, ruthless clarity, and an 
extremely democratic generosity when it comes to actors. She's a woman of the 
theater first. I wouldn't have worked with her otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 Benedict Nightingale, drama critic for the London Times, was unfamiliar with a 
play he was about to review in 1990, Thomas Heywood's "A Woman Killed With 
Kindness," the story of an adulteress who starves herself to death, written in 
1603. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know Katie Mitchell's work then," Nightingale recalls. "I read the 
play and thought, 'This is rubbish. It's completely lacking in sophistication 
and style.' But Katie turned what I thought were the play's weaknesses 
completely to her advantage. You saw in the character a most touching 
helplessness." 
</P>
<P>
 Nightingale has been keeping track of Mitchell ever since, and has seen 
productions as disparate as "Ghosts," "Rutherford & Son," and John Arden's 
"Live Like Pigs." 
</P>
<P>
 "She has a distinctive style, but it's not a case of imposing her view -- she 
respects the author. She goes for an understated realism that could easily be 
flat and banal, but she charges it with intense emotion. It seems a paradox, 
but the result is a kind of unpretentious intensity. Simplicity is a 
characteristic of her work. She gets her actors charged." 
</P>
<P>
 Nightingale wouldn't be a critic if he didn't harbor a reservation or two -- 
as playwright John Richardson once said, "He also serves who stands aside and 
prates." Of Mitchell, Nightingale says, "I don't know if she really wants the 
larger space; she tends to go in for chamber productions. And she only does 
revivals -- although that's characteristic of the new young directors in 
general. I think Thatcher's England and its aftermath has been particularly 
discouraging to the new playwright. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she's done better work than she shows in 'Henry VI,' " he added. "But 
she does a lot with a difficult subject. It's one of Shakespeare's earlier 
plays, and notoriously difficult to bring to life. It doesn't show a lot of 
respect for its characters, who're like kids in a sand pit -- except they have 
the power to chop off each other's heads." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, while the periphery of "Henry VI" is draped in the shadows of 
conspirators honing their schemes, its center contains the wan light of 
aftermath -- the faded image of a rainy October morning 40 years earlier, when 
the redoubtable Henry V whipped up his exhausted, terrified, disease-ridden 
troops to one more stand in the field at Agincourt. It was one of the most 
amazing battles ever fought. French knights, eager to crush the ragtag British, 
slathered onto a field so thick with mud that they crammed into immobilized 
clots of tangled iron, leather and flesh, where the British waded in and hacked 
them to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry's army of less than 6,000, losing but 450 of their own, left 30,000 
French dead. He would go on to sign a peace treaty with the King of France and 
to woo and wed the king's daughter, Katharine, and then stand as one of 
history's incandescent symbols of courage and patriotic heroism. But neither he 
nor anyone else knew that Agincourt's blood would eventually seep into his 
House of Lancaster, and claim his son. 
</P>
<P>
 "A slaughterer," Mitchell calls Henry V. Other adjectives include, "greedy," 
"vicious," and "a warmonger." Suddenly our hindsight shifts uneasily on our 
shared cinematic recollection of Laurence Olivier's swollen militant pride, 
Kenneth Branagh's boyishly charmed purposefulness. All of which underscores 
Nightingale's observation, "There's a gritty integrity in Katie's work that 
shows up in 'Henry VI,' " as he concludes, "I judge her by an extremely high 
standard." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, by the time her interview ends, Mitchell has disabused her listener of 
the notion that the theater, to her, is some kind of bully pulpit. "Life is 
more interesting than theater," she says. "One doesn't know where one's greed 
for life may lead. It could be anthropology. It could be working for Amnesty 
International. But theater is an art form you should not take lightly. If I 
don't keep a 100% commitment to it, I'll walk away."*

NOVELIST AND SCREENWRITER LARRY MCMURTRY ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS TAKING ON A 
CO-WRITER, THE LITERARY WORLD RAISED ITS COLLECTIVE BROW. BUT HOLLYWOOD HASN'T 
HAD A PROBLEM WITH IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They have the couple's habit of finishing each other's sentences, a habit they 
have now turned into a novel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The collaboration, from the point of view of the writing, has always been 
very easy," says Larry McMurtry, one of America's most celebrated authors, 
slurping a Dr Pepper. "It's only when we've edged out into the public arena, 
when something gets published and our names show up in the trades, that it 
wasn't . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . Easy," adds Diana Ossana, one of America's most celebrated, um, former 
legal secretaries? 
</P>
<P>
 McMurtry and Ossana have done considerably more than edge into public view 
recently, writing the teleplay for the upcoming CBS production of "Streets of 
Laredo" (McMurtry's sequel to "Lonesome Dove"), writing the screenplay for the 
feature film version of the 1950s TV show "Father Knows Best" for Universal, 
developing a script at Warner Bros. based on the true story of a Wyoming lawman 
who was tried and acquitted for killing an unarmed suspect he believed was 
about to kill him and writing a Western, also for Universal, called "The 
Standoff." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Paramount has Shirley MacLaine attached to "Evening Star," the 
sequel to "Terms of Endearment" that McMurtry published as a novel two years 
ago. McMurtry has also adapted yet another of his own best-selling Western 
novels, "Buffalo Girls," with co-writers Beth Sullivan and Cynthia Whitcomb for 
CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 That sudden convulsion of film and television work has been joined by Simon & 
Schuster's publication this fall of their collaborative novel "Pretty Boy 
Floyd," from which McMurtry and Ossana read excerpts recently at Book Soup in 
West Hollywood. The appearance was part of the first extended book tour 
McMurtry has ever done, though it seems to have been to little avail. "Pretty 
Boy Floyd" has been given prominent display in bookstores and advertised 
heavily, but it has received mixed reviews and has not yet made it to the New 
York Times bestseller list. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the buzz already surrounding their unusual partnership -- the New York 
Times characterized Ossana recently as "Mr. McMurtry's companion" -- "Pretty 
Boy Floyd" had been among the more eagerly awaited publishing events of the 
fall season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And why shouldn't it have been? McMurtry is part of that small pride of 
American literary lions whose voice could be mistaken for no other, a writer 
with an epic sense of scale -- as he demonstrated with the cowboy colossus 
"Lonesome Dove" -- and a lapidary precision with dialogue that he has 
transformed into more than 30 screenplays. McMurtry, from 1989 to 1991, was 
also the first non-New Yorker to serve as president of the literary 
organization PEN since the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 Ossana, on the other hand, "has been writing ever since she learned to read," 
according to her brief biography on the dust jacket of "Pretty Boy Floyd." 
</P>
<P>
 If it is difficult to know what Ossana's contribution was to the rather inert 
quality of the novel, there is no doubt she has been the driving force behind 
McMurtry's recent burst of activity in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "She gets his juices going and keeps him wanting to write and keep writing," 
says Jerry Katzman, the William Morris agent who represents the pair in much of 
their screen work. 
</P>
<P>
 Says McMurtry: "One of the problems I have with screenwriting is that it's an 
interrupted activity. To write something and then have it reappear in my life 
seven or eight years later is like a marriage reappearing. Until Diana came 
along, I was a first-stage-of-the-rocket screenwriter. I do two drafts because 
I can't do more than two drafts of anything, and I get some characters in there 
that are good enough to show to a studio. I can get characters on paper that 
major actors would want to play, but I have no sense of structure. Diana tends 
to worry the material in a way that's good." 
</P>
<P>
 As a form, the collaborative novel has been a literary slough of despond that 
has rarely risen above its mismatched talent pools, sinking even Ford Madox 
Ford and Joseph Conrad, who separately tried to navigate its murky waters. 
</P>
<P>
 If McMurtry's enterprise has about it a suggestive whiff of hubris, it will be 
scented first in the collectively flared nostrils of the New York lit-crit 
Establishment, among whom McMurtry's apparently heedless attempt to transform 
Ossana into his very own literary Eliza Doolittle must have raised a few 
eyebrows. Assuming snakes have eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hollywood, where the dream factories have always encouraged an 
assembly-line approach to writing, last May's announcement that Ossana and 
McMurtry would collaborate on a screen adaptation of the '50s television series 
"Father Knows Best" raised a slightly different set of questions. The first of 
these -- Father Freakin' Knows Best ? with its correlative How much are they 
getting ? -- begs the second question, stated with as much attitude as 
possible: Didn't McMurtry once win the Pulitzer Prize for fiction? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they see it as somehow beneath him," Ossana says. "But Larry sees 
screenwriting as being a gun for hire." 
</P>
<P>
 In that way, he's a bit like Pretty Boy Floyd himself, about whom McMurtry and 
Ossana first wrote an unproduced screenplay, which they have now followed with 
what is either a novel, or a pre-release, pre-green-lighting novelization of a 
movie that they are still trying to sell to Hollywood. "Larry and I have a 
sense that if the book is successful," Ossana says, "it will drive the movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Before "Pretty Boy's" pretty big first printing, Ossana's sole exposure to the 
literary world consisted of typing the manuscript of retired Mafia Don Joe 
Bonanno's memoirs. ("Mr. B," as Ossana affectionately refers to the aging 
godfather once known to organized crime officials as Joe Bananas, is a client 
of the Tucson personal-injury law firm where she worked.) 
</P>
<P>
 It was Ossana's seeming lack of experience that led to much of the speculation 
about her relationship with McMurtry, particularly in the gossipy old New York 
Times, where it was also reported that their agent had demanded that Ossana's 
name be of equal size to McMurtry's on the book's cover. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The rumors) gave the sense that I was riding on Larry's coattails," Ossana 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 McMurtry's coattails have been considerably lengthened -- and his hide 
coarsened -- by the publication of 17 single-handed novels, so he knew what he 
was getting Ossana into. 
</P>
<P>
 "The publishing business is conservative, and if you try to do something 
different like a collaborative novel, you've got to expect trouble," he says. 
"Diana was naive about how mean the New York publishing world can be, but the 
knives were not really out for her; she was just sort of stabbed in passing." 
</P>
<P>
 Ossana resisted even having her name on the novel for a while, and at one 
point sent faxes around to everyone involved in the project to say so -- 
"thinking everyone would just heave a sigh of relief," she says. "I just 
thought it would make everything simpler if my name wasn't on it. Larry was, 
after all, a proven commodity, and I thought that way Simon & Schuster wouldn't 
have to wonder if this would be a good book. But everyone started faxing back 
and the phone started ringing." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was horrified," McMurtry puts in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so odd to me," Ossana says, "that people should care about me. I don't 
have the need or the desire for all that attention. The important thing is the 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important that what's true be true," McMurtry corrects her. "You wrote 
half the book, you should have your name on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the conclusion of their collaboration on the novel, Ossana, 45, has gone 
to working on her own book. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's bound to be speculation that she's the girlfriend," McMurtry says. 
"It's always assumed that it's romantic, whether it is or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it romantic? 
</P>
<P>
 "Call it an amitie amoureuse ," McMurtry replies. "That's all one can say." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe not all. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time, early in their friendship, when McMurtry and Ossana would 
grow too enraged to speak to each other in person, resorting to volleying 
letters back and forth between their neighboring Tucson homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would turn my phone off for three or four days, and he would be frantic," 
Ossana says, pleased with herself at the memory of this. "That's one thing he 
can't stand." 
</P>
<P>
 They met by chance almost a decade ago while eating at a catfish restaurant 
here and stayed in touch while McMurtry continued to lead a life that was as 
relentlessly picaresque as his novels. He has homes in Washington; Archer City, 
Tex.; Tucson, and Los Angeles and had perfected what he calls a "tricoastal 
existence," usually spending about a week in each place before starting the 
cycle over again. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would see me in Tucson three or four days a month, but we would talk five 
and six times a day on the phone," Ossana says. "Larry has many women friends 
-- or did -- and he talked to them on a regular basis on the phone. It was his 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the Proust of the message machine," McMurtry adds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Larry is a very private person, and when I met him he had his life very 
compartmentalized," she says. "When he's in your town being your friend, you 
feel like you're the only friend in his life. I know that his other women 
friends, and even his family, are very possessive of him, and I guess I'm 
different because I'm not at all possessive of him." 
</P>
<P>
 McMurtry had come to Tucson to visit a friend, Leslie Marmon Silko, the author 
of "Almanac of the Dead," and the two began collaborating on screenplays, 
though they never attempted to write a novel together. "Leslie is a great 
writer," McMurtry says. "She truly does have genius, and I don't think you 
collaborate with genius." 
</P>
<P>
 He and Ossana continued to run into each other socially, and a few months 
after they met, the two traveled to Washington together so he could show her 
the antiquarian bookstore, Booked Up, he owns there (one of three shops he owns 
by that name). 
</P>
<P>
 "Things evolved," she says. "We just kept getting closer and closer." 
</P>
<P>
 The intensity of McMurtry's friendships with women -- particularly well-known 
ones such as Diane Keaton, Cybill Shepherd and Silko -- have made him the 
object of what must, for a bespectacled boy from Archer City, be gratifying 
speculation about his standing as a literary Lothario. McMurtry explains his 
relationships in terms of endearment, as part of his aesthetic life, not his 
athletic one. 
</P>
<P>
 "The capacity for a male novelist to be friends with a woman -- whether 
novelist or not -- is born of curiosity about emotion," he says, "because women 
are much more articulate about it. I really don't relate to men. I don't find 
out anything from them, and I think I have such a driving curiosity that I just 
don't want to waste time. So I've not only enjoyed my friendships with women, 
I've also derived my whole view of human character from them. Which is very 
useful when you're writing 18 novels." 
</P>
<P>
 McMurtry's Tucson bookstore is in what might charitably be called a 
transitional neighborhood. "I see it all as Benettons and Calvin Kleins in a 
few years," he says, "but right now it's all junkies from the rehab center 
across the street, pimps and whores from the Circle K, hustlers and 
scramblers." 
</P>
<P>
 Like a succulent, McMurtry requires steady irradiation from the sun to help 
ease the migraine headaches that have plagued him since childhood, so he rises 
at first light and by 7:30 has usually polished off his daily five-page 
constitutional at a manual typewriter. This frees him to spend the remainder of 
the day examining dusty hardcovers at his bookshop. 
</P>
<P>
 When Warner Bros. asked him in May of last year to rewrite a Pretty Boy Floyd 
script that the studio had bought and then shelved, McMurtry's muscular prose 
style had been so withered by a reaction to heart surgery 18 months earlier 
that he initially turned down the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked at it and said the same thing he had been saying: 'I can't make 
this character sympathetic,' " Ossana recalls. "I was getting sort of desperate 
for him to snap out of it by that time." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't help that neither one of them knew Charlie Floyd's story. "Until 
then, I had thought Pretty Boy Floyd was a boxer," Ossana says. "Both of us 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 They did enough research to convince themselves that Floyd's life was almost 
irresistibly cinematic and then began writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would give Diana a five-page segment," McMurtry says, "and she would expand 
and refine it. When we finished the script, we still had a certain amount of 
momentum as collaborators, and we didn't feel we were through with Charlie 
Floyd." 
</P>
<P>
 Their only disagreement while writing the novel happened as they were going 
over the first draft of the manuscript together for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was excited because some of it Larry hadn't seen," Ossana says. "We were 
reading and he says, 'You know we're going to cut at least a hundred pages of 
this.' I was aghast. I said, 'No, we're not. Over my dead body.' And we didn't 
cut a thing, maybe three or four words in the whole book." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after they finished the novel, McMurtry and Ossana were hired by 
Universal to write the adaptation of "Father Knows Best." Again there was some 
whispering about Ossana's unseen role, this time that she was operating as a 
sort of Kitten with a whip: Hi , Mom. Hi , Dad. Hi , Princess. Hi , Bud! What's 
Yoko Ono doing here ? 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't as if Universal had to beg McMurtry and Ossana to take an interest 
in its project. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we heard Larry and Diana had an interest -- and more than that, a take 
on the material -- that was the creatively interesting thing," says producer 
Sean Daniel. "They saw the show as a touchstone of the culture, a way to do a 
real-life family comedy in a modern setting. These are smart, tender, 
insightful writers, people who have found ways into the lives of American 
families in the past. 'Terms of Endearment' is a masterwork of contemporary 
Americans struggling with life. The notion that they could turn a similar eye 
toward a perfect American family in both a comedic and realistic way was what 
made the idea provocative to the studio." 
</P>
<P>
 The studio was so pleasantly dumbfounded that McMurtry would soil the hem of 
his sackcloth and ashes that he was required to travel to Los Angeles with 
Ossana and do a pitch, just to prove his heart was in the right place. Recalls 
Ossana: "One thing the Universal people said to Larry really annoyed him. They 
asked him, 'Why would you, Larry McMurtry, want to write this?' I felt him 
tense up and the air get thick." 
</P>
<P>
 McMurtry studied his cowboy boots for a moment, and replied, "I'm very annoyed 
by people presuming to know what I would and would not like to write." And that 
was the end of the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never saw 'Father Knows Best.' I came very late to the television age," 
McMurtry says. "But I've talked to people about it, people who really loved it 
and were comforted in their own imperfect family lives to know that there was 
this family that always came out OK." 
</P>
<P>
 McMurtry has usually come out OK artistically in Hollywood, where such 
acclaimed films as "Terms of Endearment," "The Last Picture Show" and "Hud" and 
television's seminal miniseries "Lonesome Dove" have been adapted from his 
fiction. But he had fared less well financially at the hands of super-agent 
Irving (Swifty) Lazar, who died last December just as many of Ossana and 
McMurtry's projects were in a state of ferment. (McMurtry also harbored a deep 
affection for Lazar, and delivered a moving eulogy at his funeral.) 
</P>
<P>
 "It happened that just as he really faded, we had all these deals -- three 
screenplays and the novel -- and it was beyond him," McMurtry says. "The 
contracts were nightmarishly scrambled, he didn't give a damn, and he was 
selling the future as far ahead as he could possibly sell it so he could spend 
the money before he died.  
</P>
<P>
 "Two months before his death, I went to Hollywood and I asked him to retire," 
McMurtry says. "I wrote him a seven-page letter detailing the things (that were 
wrong) because I felt that he was going to embarrass himself really badly 
because he didn't know what he was doing. With Irving you got Irving, you got 
contact with a really interesting man. To me that was worth whatever I lost, 
and I probably lost $10 million or $15 million." 
</P>
<P>
 It is McMurtry's 58th birthday, and his lawyer in Los Angeles has sent him 50 
cases of Dr Pepper in glass bottles. "That's a lot of Dr Pepper," McMurtry 
says. "Not that I won't drink it. The glass bottles are very refined, though. I 
won't drink Dr Pepper in anything but glass bottles, and I've drunk hundreds 
upon hundreds of cases." 
</P>
<P>
 After half a century of this intemperance, McMurtry had quadruple-bypass 
surgery in December, 1991, then came here to recuperate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ran into a cow in a rented Lincoln in Texas," he says. This is where the 
story begins. "I'd been moving books from my ranch house to this mansion I have 
in town. It was about dusk on a summer evening. I was on a country road, and 
this Holstein suddenly sidled across the road and I hit her and killed her. I 
had an uncomfortable night, but I had stirred up a lot of dust moving those 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next morning, I was going to town for breakfast and when I got in the car 
the air-bag light began to blink," he continues. "The air-bag did not come out 
when I hit the cow and I hit her a mighty good whack. As I drove to the Lincoln 
(repair) place, I passed the clinic where my internist practices, so I stopped 
to get something for dust asthma. He didn't think I looked too good, so he gave 
me an EKG and said, 'Oh my God, you're having a heart attack.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The closer to death he gets, the more obvious it is McMurtry is enjoying 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "An ambulance was brought, but I was in a room so tiny they couldn't get the 
stretcher in," he says. "They wouldn't let me step out of the room, so they had 
to dismantle the stretcher. I could have easily died of all the things that 
happened while they were trying to save me. Then on the way to the hospital, 
the ambulance drivers became excited when they found out they were hauling the 
author of 'Lonesome Dove' and they drove straight off a very high curb." 
</P>
<P>
 "He had kind of a psychic trauma," Ossana says. "It was very scary. He wrote 
'Streets of Laredo' during that period, but he says it was almost as if it was 
faxed to him by his former self." 
</P>
<P>
 "My intention was to get back into my life, go back to running the bookstores, 
giving lectures, traveling around, buying books," McMurtry says. "I tried it 
for a couple of weeks and I completely faded out. I felt like I had become an 
outline, the content drained out. I think it's because you die during the 
operation. You're jump-started back to life, but there's a gap. That's a 
profound thing. To this day I still have a sense of not being myself." 
</P>
<P>
 The sense of unreality of self had also happened after "Lonesome Dove" 
appeared on CBS in 1989, when McMurtry discovered that there were people posing 
as him on both sides of the Mexican border, like ghost images on a television 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the popularity of the miniseries, I began to develop a number of 
impostors," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 One lived in a trailer park and apparently promised women he would put them in 
his next movie if they were nice to him. Another had persuaded a woman he was 
about to marry in Houston that he was the celebrated Texas author, while a 
third made such a nuisance of himself in the Mexican resort Puerto Vallarta 
that McMurtry finally hired a private detective to track him down. "He signs 
books," McMurtry says. "He has a temper, and when he gets drunk he spits on 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 This had gotten to be a bit like the old ventriloquist's trick -- McMurtry 
would sip reflectively from a bottle of Dr Pepper in Arizona, while somewhere 
across the border Senor Larry was spitting it out on a tourist -- until the 
impersonator began to feel more like McMurtry than McMurtry did. 
</P>
<P>
 His impostors seemed to have moved on, finally, no doubt as baffled as his 
readers by the strangely inert quality of "Pretty Boy Floyd." Like Floyd 
himself, the novel leaves few fingerprints and none of the memorable prose 
sentences that McMurtry once described as "the DNA of a novelist's identity." 
These once-glittering strands now lie at his feet, a chalk outline of Charlie 
Floyd. Or is it McMurtry himself? 
</P>
<P>
 "The funny thing is, after the heart surgery I began to feel like one of my 
own impostors," he says. "I felt as if I was impersonating myself. . . . " 
Ossana, sitting nearby, opens her mouth as if she is about to speak. But then 
she eases back into her seat and says nothing.;

<TEXT>
<P>
 A drive along Carroll Avenue, slightly uphill from Echo Park Lake, is a voyage 
to another era. Architecturally significant Victorian-style houses in various 
stages of renovation grace the street. Magisterial and imposing, they are out 
of character with the stucco, tiled-roofed, single-story dwellings on the 
neighboring streets. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a warm, sunny, slightly humid day. The time is exactly 3 p.m. The year is 
1966. 
</P>
<P>
 A pickup roars into the driveway of one reconstituted gabled structure, where 
a back-yard barbecue is in progress. A dozen or more African American men and 
women, dressed in brightly printed dashikis , chat and drink lemon-colored 
punch from cut-glass cups as Gladys Knight plaintively intones "If I Were Your 
Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Several men in black leather jackets, sunglasses and berets, carrying 
shotguns, jump out of the truck. They march into the back yard in military 
formation. There is a pointed confrontation that stops just short of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of the standoff, everyone freezes in place, like plaster-cast 
statues. Director Mario Van Peebles, casually dressed in faded denim overalls, 
weaves his way to the eye of the storm, quietly speaks and gesticulates and 
drops back again. 
</P>
<P>
 The action resumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll Avenue is standing in for downtown Oakland in this sequence of Van 
Peebles' new film, "Panther." It was written by his father, Melvin Van Peebles, 
who adapted it from his upcoming novel about the early days of the Black 
Panther Party, the controversial militant African American organization founded 
in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Van Peebles keeps his distance from the action, available for 
consultation (he also has a small part in the film), otherwise content to amble 
about, which he does with a slight limp. Van Peebles chews on an unlit stogie 
and complains about his bandaged toe. "I was bitten by a racist spider," he 
says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "Panther," which is to be released early next year by Gramercy Pictures, 
evolved from a fictional tale on which Van Peebles has been working 
sporadically for 15 years. The novel will be published at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of both projects seems right. After fading into relative obscurity 
-- "because history is written by the winners," according to his actor-director 
son -- the Black Panthers are back in the news. Rappers like Tupac Shakur 
glorify them; autobiographies by former Panther leaders Elaine Brown ("A Taste 
of Power") and David Hilliard ("This Side of Glory") were published in the last 
few years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panther renaissance arrives as the baby boomer generation tries to make 
sense of its youth, says Hilliard, a lifelong friend of Huey P. Newton and 
former chief of staff for the Panthers. Also, he adds, as with any historical 
event, distance is required to measure its importance over time. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the Panther reassessments are favorable. The recently published "The 
Shadow of the Panther," by Hugh Pearson, focuses on the charismatic Huey 
Newton, a Panther founding member, and takes a less-than-flattering position on 
the organization, which he characterizes as a "petty gang" and less than 
altruistic. Others are seeking to present segments of the Panther history with 
warts intact as a demonstration of its place as part of the continuing struggle 
of African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Guenveur Smith's one-man play "A Huey P. Newton Story" premiered 
recently in San Francisco and is due in Los Angeles early next year. Reviewers 
have cited it as a complex distillation of Newton's tragic life, which ended in 
1989 when he was murdered by a drug pusher on the streets of Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't demonize or deify Huey. I try to find the human core," as well as 
Newton's links to other African American freedom fighters, Smith says, citing 
Frederick Douglass and Marcus Garvey. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Peebleses' film is not designed as a hagiography like Spike Lee's 
"Malcolm X." Newton, Bobby Seale and Eldridge Cleaver are central to the story, 
but so is a fictional composite and audience surrogate named Judge, a reluctant 
Panther and inadvertent police informer. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for this more democratic approach is to show that "the real heroes 
were not Bobby and Huey but the folks who were needed to man the ranks," the 
younger Van Peebles says. "The genesis of the Black Panther Party was unlike 
any other civil rights movement. It was not about jobs or a seat on the bus. It 
was directed at the lumpen proletariat." 
</P>
<P>
 For Van Peebles senior, the groundbreaking writer-director of "Sweet 
Sweetback's Baadasssss Song," a 1971 film that he says was once required 
viewing for the Panthers, the mantle of fiction allowed him artistic license 
"to be everywhere I want to be." 
</P>
<P>
 "This film is meant to be more a forest than a tree because there are a 
thousand different perspectives on this story," he says. "A Panther was born 
every minute in the ghetto." 
</P>
<P>
 The ensemble consists of several relatively fresh young faces, including 
Marcus Chong, Kadeem Hardison, Bokeem Woodbine and Courtney Vance, with cameos 
by Bobby Brown, Angela Bassett, Chris Rock and Dick Gregory. The youth and 
relative inexperience of some of the actors, the director says, is meant to 
reflect the attitude of young, raw talents who founded and peopled the Panther 
Party in its early days. 
</P>
<P>
 Another, more practical reason for using relatively unfamiliar actors is that 
they mirror the demographics of the core African American audience the film is 
trying to reach, says one of its producers, Preston Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
 For African American youth, author Pearson says, current interest in the 
history of the Black Panthers is yet another attempt "to shore up their sense 
of self." 
</P>
<P>
 But for too many of them, "Panther" will serve as their introduction to a 
pivotal moment in recent black history and to the volatile political era that 
gave rise to its creation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a focus group of black youth, age 16 to 19," Holmes says, "in which 
we discovered that many had never even heard of the Black Panthers." 
</P>
<P>
 And when they were told about the organization, says Mario Van Peebles, they 
were upset: "They wanted to know why this story hadn't been told before, why 
it's not in the history books." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the 31-year-old filmmaker acknowledges that he knew only the broad 
strokes of the party's history. Several of the film's actors were aware of the 
Panthers only as a minor historical footnote. Since being cast, they have made 
up for lost time. Chong and Vance embarked on crash courses, not only reading 
autobiographies of former party members like Newton, Seale, Brown and George 
Jackson but also books that influenced them, such as quotations from Mao 
Tse-tung and Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of peaceful resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never worked so hard in my life," says Chong, who plays the brilliant 
and troubled Newton. 
</P>
<P>
 His goal, says Chong, son of comedian Tommy Chong and brother of actress Rae 
Dawn Chong, is not to imitate Newton but to capture the essence of this black 
leader: "If I can get the text across, I'll have accomplished something -- to 
make others understand how a man could come to such an insightful love for his 
people that he would become a revolutionary. Revolution is basically against 
the law in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Vance revels in the opportunity to open a window on recent history that has 
been stubbornly shut for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing to portray and deal with a time period, when black men stood up 
to cops, when society was threatened by any black man who knew what he was 
about and wanted to do," Vance says. "But when you stand up, there's a price to 
be paid. You have to try to stay alive." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Van Peebleses say they have not set out to deliver a history lesson. 
Their ambitions are much narrower: They simply want to crack open a door that 
was previously shut and engender awareness. In part, that is why the filmmakers 
created the character Judge, "a reluctant hero," says actor Kadeem Hardison, 
who plays him. Judge functions as an audience surrogate and as an active 
participant in the party's tumultuous early days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young people want to see young people do things. They can relate to that," 
Hardison says. "When they see young people standing up for themselves, they'll 
get excited. Then maybe they'll be able to see beyond that." 
</P>
<P>
 For those old enough to remember the Black Panthers, the film is intended to 
be an antidote to what its creators regard as a one-sided demonization of the 
party through the media. 
</P>
<P>
 The birth of the grass-roots organization was an inextricable part of a 
turbulent political era marked by race riots and anti-war protests. The 
Panthers' militant stance was vilified in the press, which fed on the era's 
existing "racial paranoia," says Van Peebles senior. 
</P>
<P>
 Says producer Holmes: "It was called the Black Panther Party for Self Defense. 
But the image that was generated was of black people with guns. People are 
still afraid of that image. Ironically, the same people who tried to take the 
guns out of our hands then are the same people who are fighting against gun 
control today." 
</P>
<P>
 The filmmakers are concentrating on the birth and early years of the movement, 
mostly in Northern California (though the party eventually had chapters around 
the country), both for the sake of dramatic clarity and to demonstrate that the 
creation of the Panthers was as much socially motivated as political. 
</P>
<P>
 It all began, says Tarika, an early Panther member who serves as a consultant 
on the film, because there was no traffic light at the corner of 55th and 
Market streets in downtown Oakland, the scene of several pedestrian fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
 An early scene in the film depicts a peaceful protest at the corner that turns 
violent when the Oakland police intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 Overlooked in most media accounts of the Panthers, she says, were the 
organization's founding principles, a 10-point program calling for such goals 
as decent housing, full employment and trial by a jury of one's peers. 
</P>
<P>
 The ideas were sound, but the party's disintegration erased many of its real 
accomplishments, such as the creation of community-based medical testing for 
lead poisoning and sickle-cell anemia, food giveaways and the Oakland Community 
Learning Center. The Panthers also worked to register voters and to ease 
bigotry in the police force and local government. 
</P>
<P>
 And to get that traffic light on 55th and Market. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this movie brings to light the principles, ideals and sacrifices made 
by the youth, some of whom gave up their lives for the community," says Tarika, 
who left the party in the late '60s to join the Nation of Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, she says, the Black Panther Party was beset by growing pains. Newton 
was sentenced to prison for his involvement in the death of a police officer, 
and the party was infiltrated by agitators and informants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Panther" ends before some of these and other more troublesome problems -- 
such as misogyny, extortion, homicide and drug dealing -- begin. 
</P>
<P>
 In the film, however, the central character of Judge is recruited by the 
police and blackmailed. Throughout, he barely stays one step ahead of them. 
</P>
<P>
 This is likely to be one of the most controversial aspects of "Panther": the 
argument that there was a conspiracy between local police and J. Edgar Hoover's 
FBI to systematically destroy the Black Panthers through harassment and 
infiltration. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas Pearson says his research goes against this scenario, Hilliard fires 
back with reams of documents that he says clearly prove governmental 
interference dating to 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 T he paranoia that surrounded the Panthers was due in part to their emergence 
during one of the nation's most politically volatile periods, aided and abetted 
by the characters of Hoover and then-President Richard Nixon, Holmes says. 
</P>
<P>
 "To some extent they overreacted," he says. "There were so many challenges to 
the status quo at that time, including the Vietnam protests. Nixon feared that 
if the Panthers became focused, they could capture the imagination of the black 
masses and become a vehicle for their anger and frustration." 
</P>
<P>
 A more incendiary contention is that the destruction of major inner-city 
neighborhoods through drugs and violence was commandeered as an outside effort 
to pacify and control the African American urban population. Director Van 
Peebles compares it to the influx of opium in China by the British as a means 
of quelling the Boxer Rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Pearson, who is openly suspect of the Panthers' motives and 
effectiveness, says that "there's evidence that drugs were brought (into 
African American communities) deliberately." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Holmes says, "it's not documented, so it's hard to prove. Still, 
there's no question that the massive influx of hard drugs into black 
communities has served to douse the flames of protest. In a documentary I saw 
recently about the South Bronx, one of the police commanders said that he 
considered drugs and alcohol his best friends for keeping the lid on the black 
community. He said he would hate to see what would happen if most of the 
population wasn't narcotized." 
</P>
<P>
 Also going against the grain is the fact that one of the most reprehensible of 
the film's characters is an African American, an FBI informant, played by Roger 
Guenveur Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to fight to introduce a bad black guy," Mario Van Peebles says. "It 
would have been easy to finger-point, but the question is more complex than 
that. If there is no enemy within, you can do no real harm." 
</P>
<P>
 That was just one of the battles Van Peebles fought in trying to get "Panther" 
made. Though his directing debut, "New Jack City" (1991), grossed nearly $50 
million domestically, the search for financing on "Panther" was a 
back-to-square-one proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people were scared of the material," says Van Peebles, who has been 
offered many more lucrative assignments that he lumps under the collective 
title "Revenge of the Crackheads, Part 2." 
</P>
<P>
 As he had done with his second film, "Posse" (1993), an African American 
Western in which he also starred, he preferred to use whatever clout he had 
acquired as a director to take on a subject that might otherwise never make it 
to the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than spend the years it would take to self-finance the film, he 
approached PolyGram Filmed Entertainment President Michael Kuhn, who had helped 
finance "Posse." After "hammering out numbers," a deal was signed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammering out numbers meant doing a period piece for less money than Van 
Peebles had used to shoot the contemporary "New Jack City." That required 
whittling his shooting schedule to 39 days and asking people like Holmes to 
work for a lot less than they could normally command. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes has worked frequently with Spike Lee and had already begun production 
on "Crooklyn" when the call came. The Van Peebles project, however, was too 
good to pass up, and he asked Lee to be relieved of his duties so he could sign 
on. He had wanted to make a movie about the Black Panthers since college, but 
it was also important to him that it be done right. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry's reluctance regarding "Panther," he says, is not political but 
practical. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of talk in the black community about what Hollywood will or 
won't allow us to make," Holmes says. "The answer is they will allow what makes 
money. Before 'Posse' started there were half a dozen other films about the 
black West in development. Because 'Posse' didn't do better, none of them are 
getting made." 
</P>
<P>
 In return for bringing his movie in for a mere $7 million and working for 
scale, Van Peebles is not only getting "Panther" made, but he gets final cut -- 
that rarest of all rare privileges for directors. 
</P>
<P>
 By the middle of shooting, he says, he was too committed inside the process to 
know whether "Panther" is truly commercial: "Right now, I have no idea whether 
it will make 5 cents." He would like it to make much, much more, he says, which 
would help him and other black writers and directors deal with a broader range 
of African American subjects on film. 
</P>
<P>
 But the simple accomplishment of getting "Panther" made is significant, Van 
Peebles says, reflecting the ideals with which the party was created. 
</P>
<P>
 "They went out and they did it," he says. "And that in and of itself was 
cathartic." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Holmes: "This is not a film about victims and victimization but about 
people who took their destiny into their own hands." 
</P>
<P>
 He hopes "Panther" will effectively show young African Americans "who believed 
that their actions as individuals and as a group could make a difference. Most 
black youth today have no sense that they can make a difference. That's 
dangerous to our society."

 In June, 1968, Los Angeles-based photographer Howard Bingham found himself on 
his way to Oakland to shoot the Black Panthers for an article for Life magazine 
by Gilbert Moore. As a stringer for Life, Bingham had covered riots in Watts, 
Detroit and Newark earlier in the '60s.Life's editors, Moore said, thought 
Oakland--the center of Black Panther activity--could be the next urban area to 
go up in flames. Yet Bingham was unconcerned by the potential violence. "I was 
just going to do a job," Bingham recalled recently. "We went up there to 
photograph the Panthers as an organization--to capture a moment, a whole 
scene." As it happened, neither Bingham's photos nor Gilbert Moore's article, 
which Moore later turned into a book, "A Special Rage," were ever published in 
Life. Upon the release of the film "Panther" next year, Bingham plans to 
exhibit his photographs, some of which appear here, in Los Angeles. ANNE

FILM CLIPS / MINIMAL MOVIES: ANDY WARHOL'S DREAM FACTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kristine McKenna 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1963, Pop artist Andy Warhol, then the reigning enfant terrible of the 
avant-garde, got a movie camera and began turning out films at a furious pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Shot largely at his studio known as the Factory, an avant-garde petri dish 
where the grooviest people on Earth gathered to take drugs, party and keep the 
wheels of Warhol's art mill running, these wildly unfettered films broke the 
boundaries of conventional cinema in every way imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
 Life at the Factory changed dramatically, however, in June, 1968, when Warhol 
was shot in the stomach by a deranged woman named Valerie Solanas. No longer a 
free zone where weirdos of every stripe could wander in and out at their 
leisure, the Factory took on the aura of a fortress, and other things changed 
as well. Warhol took all his existing films out of circulation, believing that 
their unavailability would increase their value. After completing "Blue Movie" 
(a film that was withdrawn from theaters the following year when it was 
declared obscene by New York's Criminal Court), he handed the directorial 
duties on all future films over to one of his assistants, Paul Morrissey. 
Warhol settled into the producer's chair at this point and began creating such 
movies as "Andy Warhol's Dracula" and "Andy Warhol's Frankenstein" -- films 
widely seen as Warhol's attempt to go Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Andy had this dream he was really gonna end up in Hollywood -- they say it's 
the only dream he could never fulfill," says Ronald Tavel, who scripted a dozen 
of Warhol's films in the '60s and appeared in several more. 
</P>
<P>
 The hundreds of films Warhol shot between 1963-68 have been largely unseen for 
decades. Now, through the combined efforts of the Warhol Foundation and New 
York's Museum of Modern Art and Whitney Museum, they're being restored and 
released at a rate of approximately six per year (24 films have been released 
so far). 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles will get its first look at films whose years of absence have 
bathed them in a mythical glow Thursday through Sunday when "Warhol Weekend: 
The Films of Andy Warhol" comes to the Pacific Design Center. A benefit for the 
local film collective Filmforum, the program includes a dozen films, among them 
"The Velvet Underground and Nico," "The Chelsea Girls" and four films featuring 
the ill-fated debutante Edie Sedgwick. 
</P>
<P>
 Curated by critic David Ehrenstein, the benefit includes an opening-night 
party, appearances by Tavel and actress Susan Bottomly, and the projection of 
"Empire" -- Warhol's eight-hour film of the Empire State Building -- on the 
exterior of the Pacific Design Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Often described as the first Deconstructivist director, Warhol breaks film 
down into four rudimentary components: fixed images, movement, sound and 
behavior (one is reluctant to use words like plot or story in regards to his 
rigorously Minimal films). Drawing freely from both Hollywood and the 
avant-garde, Warhol dreamed of a never-ending, all-inclusive movie, and saw 
film as a medium that could ultimately reveal everything about its subject. 
Toward those ends he completed everything from a film that ran for 25 hours 
("Four Star") to hundreds of "screen tests" that were nothing more than 
Warhol's training his camera on people who struck his fancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, mainstream moviegoing audiences of the '60s found Warhol's 
early films taxing at best, but chances are good that '90s film historians are 
going to find much that's worthwhile in this long-lost body of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most widely held misconception about Andy's films is that they're purely 
conceptual, and that if somebody describes them to you, you don't have to see 
them," says Tavel, who met Warhol when he was a young poet reading in New York 
cafes in the early '60s. "The other big misconception is that any mistakes that 
occurred were fine with him -- his films were much more thought through and 
calculated than people realize." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the contribution Warhol's movies made to the lexicon of film, 
they provide a fascinating record of the social phenomena of the '60s, when the 
nuclear family began to disintegrate, the sexual revolution erupted and drug 
use was rampant. Looked at today, when we know the wages of drugs and casual 
sex far too well, those idyllic Factory days seem a million light years ago; 
oddly, Warhol's people seem almost innocent in their decadence. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more fascinating is the alchemy of personality that occurred under the 
watchful gaze of Warhol, who had an intuitive feeling for combustive 
combinations of people. One could make the case that human behavior is the only 
subject of his films, and he shows it with an unflinching candor that verges on 
cruelty.  
</P>
<P>
 Obsessed with the cultural virus known as fame, Warhol redefined the concept 
of movie star, creating his own category of performer that he dubbed 
"superstar" -- anyone who could carry a film on the strength of personality 
alone. In fact, many of Warhol's performers do nothing more than turn up the 
volume on their own personalities; several of his films amount to little more 
than very long shots of one of his superstars killing time in some hotel room 
or apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Andy didn't actually direct anybody in his films, and words like auteur and 
director don't really apply to him," says Tavel, who wrote "Vinyl" and "The 
Life of Juanita Castro," which are included in the Filmforum program. "He was 
more an entrepreneur whose aesthetic controlled the films. In fact, he didn't 
like to work directly on most of the films -- all the art he made revolved to a 
degree around the act of removing himself." 
</P>
<P>
 "Andy didn't actually do anything -- that was the essence of his talent," 
observes actress Mary Woronov, who met Warhol when she was a 20-year-old art 
student at Cornell and appeared in seven of his films made between 1964-68. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember a scene in one film where I was on a bed with (poet) Ed Hood and 
Andy kept saying 'Do something, Mary, do something.' He couldn't think of 
anything for me to do, so he just kept saying 'Do something.' My most vivid 
memory of Andy is of him standing there with his white, white skin complaining 
bitterly in this little whine."  
</P>
<P>
 In reading the history of Warhol's activities as a filmmaker, one is struck by 
the fact that his collaborators tended to come and go rather quickly. Described 
by some as a psychic vampire -- someone who drained the vital juices of whoever 
crossed his path, then moved on to new talent -- Warhol seemed to attract 
self-destructive people, and a surprising percentage of the '60s Factory people 
are now dead. Sedgwick, a lovely young woman who died of an overdose less than 
10 years after meeting Warhol, is the best known of the Factory fatalities, but 
there were many more like her.  
</P>
<P>
 "Andy had lots of different interests and didn't care to repeat himself -- 
those people weren't professional actors anyway," says rock singer Lou Reed of 
the rapid overturn of personnel at the Factory. "Andy didn't have a destructive 
influence on those people -- he gave people great opportunities -- he certainly 
gave me one (Warhol sponsored the Velvet Underground), and I always found him 
to be incredibly fair, generous and brilliant."  
</P>
<P>
 Counters poet Gerard Malanga, who met Warhol when he was a 20-year-old student 
at Cornell and was hired by the artist as an assistant silk-screener: "Andy had 
a destructive effect on people in that he created a dream world some people 
bought into, and that dream was never fulfilled. Some of those people thought 
they had a legitimate career in the movies working with Andy -- which was a 
very naive thing to think. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never considered myself an actor, and appeared in the films as a way of 
drawing attention to my work as a poet," adds Malanga, who will publish a book 
of poems, "Mythologies of the Heart," next year, and who can be seen this 
weekend in "Vinyl" and "The Chelsea Girls," a 3 1/2-hour split-screen opus 
considered by many to be Warhol's greatest film. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people in Andy's world were self-destructive to begin with, and the case 
can be made that the creativity he allowed those doomed people was the happiest 
time of their life," says Ronald Tavel, who presently lives in Taiwan where he 
teaches screenwriting. "But did he care about people? I don't think he did, nor 
did he expect people to stay a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 "Warhol was always looking for the new thing, and many of those people went 
crazy because they took lots of drugs and were heavily into amphetamines -- 
everything was fast with them," adds Woronov, who continues to act and also has 
a career as a painter. "Working with Andy was the high point in many of their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those people are dead for the simple reason that you can't live like that -- 
it's too close to the sun," she concludes. "Andy took risks and he put the 
people around him at risk, and there was a direct relationship between how 
destructively they were living and their brilliance. When you take risks like 
that with your body and your mind you get someplace, but eventually you go over 
the top."

PERFORMING ARTS; DANTE AS PERFORMANCE ARTIST; RINDE ECKERT IS A CLASSICIST IN 
AVANT-GARDE DISGUISE. OR, PERHAPS, THE REVERSE. THE WORK OF THE ITALIAN POET IS 
A NICE STARTING POINT, ANYWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bay Area writer-performer Rinde Eckert is sitting on the lawn in the UCLA 
sculpture garden, talking about "The Gardening of Thomas D." "I had done a 
series of musical pieces that stayed in a confessional realm and I wanted to 
get away from that," says the artist of his performance piece based on Dante's 
"Divine Comedy." "As a writer, I thought it was time to look at some cultural 
icons." 
</P>
<P>
 Classic texts aren't usually raw material for performance art. But Eckert -- 
one of the preeminent and most versatile figures of the West Coast 
music-theater avant garde -- is something of a closet classicist, and proud of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "My contention is that we don't need to worry about being contemporary," says 
the operatically trained tenor. "I really don't care whether something is 
avant-garde. I go where the mojo is. It's pan-historical. All I'm interested in 
is whether the work works. If there's integrity to the work, then it satisfies 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the party line of that notably amorphous genre known as 
performance art, of course. But Eckert is no typical performance artist. "The 
task of performance art is to find out how this form sustains a lifetime of 
thought, application and work," he says. "How does it begin to have the feeling 
that I have listening to Mozart or reading Dante, where it just feels like it 
can go on forever?" 
</P>
<P>
 A familiar figure in the world of the interdisciplinary stage, Eckert has 
lately become increasingly interested in the formal aesthetics of classical 
texts and music. His "The Gardening of Thomas D" will be presented at UCLA's 
Freud Playhouse this Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with a text like Dante's has helped him refine his ideas about 
performance art. "I saw possibility in this multidimensional form of art, where 
you're capable of going from something purely theatrical to something purely 
visual, and then to all of the stops in-between," says Eckert. "If I can 
develop a form that gives me some of the satisfaction that I see in the great 
works of the past, then my time will have been well spent." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eckert, 43, trained at the University of Iowa and the Yale School of Music. He 
moved briefly to New York to try his luck at a musical theater career, but 
ended up hitchhiking to California in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 First recognized on the West Coast as a singer/performer, in both opera and 
the works of his fellow Bay Area experimentalist, George Coates, Eckert has 
been based in San Francisco for the past decade. There he has developed a 
reputation as a multitalented interdisciplinary artist. 
</P>
<P>
 He's best known for a series of opera-theater pieces created in collaboration 
with the Berkeley-based Paul Dresher Ensemble. Eckert's last L.A. appearance, 
in fact, was in Dresher's political opera "Pioneer"(1990), seen at UCLA in 
1991, for which the tenor-actor-writer penned the libretto. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pioneer" was the third and final work in Dresher and Eckert's "American 
Trilogy," which began with the 1985 "Slow Fire" and continued with 1989's 
"Power Failure." " 'Slow Fire' was a personal, psychological landscape," says 
Eckert. " 'Power Failure' had to do with the nexus of business and religion. 
'Pioneer' had to do with a more abstract concept of exploitation and 
exploration. I drew on my own experience for 'Slow Fire' in particular." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Gardening of Thomas D" represented a departure from that trilogy.  
</P>
<P>
 The 80-minute work, which Eckert authored and performs in (along with modern 
dancer Ellie Klopp) premiered in San Francisco in 1992. In it, an accountant 
who's having a crisis of faith is helped out of his rut by an angel. The 
protagonist eventually returns to earth, where he creates a garden refuge for 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Gardening of Thomas D" is inspired by Dante, but that's just the 
jumping-off point. "This was my first piece that required exhaustive research," 
says Eckert, who consulted critical commentary on Dante as well as other 
resources. "But my intention was not to do an homage to Dante." 
</P>
<P>
 Eckert wanted instead to fashion a piece for the 1990s. "I was interested in 
creating a work for this time rather than pointing everybody to the remarkable 
work of an earlier time," he says. "There was no need to try and do it better 
than Dante. He did it as well as it could be done." 
</P>
<P>
 The result is by no means a takeoff on the "Divine Comedy." "I quickly 
abandoned the specifics of that work and looked at it for formal properties 
that I could apply to my own work," says Eckert. "I came up with a series of 
metaphors that had a dynamic relationship with that work, although anyone 
coming to (my) work wouldn't need to know anything about Dante." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Gardening of Thomas D" has never been seen in L.A. before, but it's not 
Eckert's most recent work. "Awed Behavior" premiered in San Francisco last 
year. The performer does not appear in the piece, based loosely on the 
tempestuous marriage of novelist Mary Shelley and the Romantic poet Percy 
Bysshe Shelley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Awed Behavior" was yet another collaboration with Dresher in which the team 
turned to cultural icons rather than the autobiographical material so popular 
among performance artists. "There are a lot of personal narratives and 
storytelling out there," says Eckert. "But a lot of the performance artwork I 
had seen was getting shallow, becoming too easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Eckert prefers instead to build upon the foundation of Western literature, 
music and theater. "Because I have a classical background, I want a vehicle 
that will locate me in history," he says. "I never felt like I wanted to lose 
my connection to the history of Western thought and art." 
</P>
<P>
 But Eckert's fondness for the canon isn't merely sentimental. "You look at 
classical works and there's always an overall formal logic to them that 
transcends all the exigencies of content," he says. "I've been looking to the 
great models of form, and Dante is amazingly formal, a mathematical puzzle that 
rivals Bach in its formal structure." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a complexity that the artist finds inspiring. "The more you get into it, 
the more you see how the thing works," he says. "I love that feeling of a work 
that you can keep going into, seeing one part of the puzzle reflected in some 
other part. It's intimidating because it's so beautifully done." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Eckert would like to define an aesthetic model for performance 
art. "It may be a slightly musty concern on my part, but the model for me is a 
(dramatic) situation that ramifies into an infinite metaphoric matrix," he 
says. "I keep looking for the situation that will do that, rather than just 
having a collection of interesting things connected by virtue of certain 
abstract qualities." 
</P>
<P>
 The benefits of such a paradigm, says Eckert, would be akin to "what sonata 
form does for classical music." "It has a formality to it that has an intrinsic 
poetry, regardless of what we understand as its political or psychological 
consequences," says Eckert. "It's beautiful in and of itself. I'm a long way 
from realizing that entirely, but it seems like a worthy pursuit."

ART; TOGETHER AGAIN, ON THE BATTLEFIELD; LEON GOLUB AND NANCY SPERO, PARTNERS 
IN LIFE AND ART, HAVE NEVER SHIED AWAY FROM TOUGH CHALLENGES. BOTH HAVE 
OVERCOME ART'S FICKLE FASHIONS WITH UNFLINCHING CRITIQUES OF WORLD VIOLENCE.

<P>
 Leon Golub and Nancy Spero are having the time of their lives. The veteran New 
York artists -- partners in marriage, aesthetic dialogues and art-world 
politics for more than four decades -- have logged more time as outsiders than 
as artists in demand. 
</P>
<P>
 But their stars have risen during the past few years as Golub has gained 
critical acclaim for his massive paintings of male aggression and Spero's 
fragile but often horrific depictions of women have exploded out of feminist 
circles into mainstream museums and galleries. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the couple -- who have relentlessly pursued their own separate versions of 
figurative Expressionism regardless of fashion -- have returned to the city 
where they lived from 1959 to 1964. They are subjects of a joint retrospective, 
"Leon Golub and Nancy Spero: War and Memory," at Paris' new American Center, 
which opened in June in a flamboyant building designed by Los Angeles-based 
architect Frank Gehry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the kind of idea you can't afford to ignore," Golub says of the show, 
smiling broadly as he and Spero stroll through the sparkling new cultural 
center. The exhibition -- organized by Katy Kline and Helaine Posner, director 
and curator, respectively, of the MIT List Visual Arts Center in Cambridge, 
Mass. -- is the second major visual art event in the center's inaugural year 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The show surveys a continuing interchange between two artists who have long 
addressed themes of social and physical conflict. For the exhibition 
centerpiece, Spero has painted a ceiling mural of female figures on walls 
leading up to a rectangular skylight. The work, called "To the Revolution," is 
a celebratory parade of mythical and historical figures led by a likeness of 
the flag-bearing woman in Eugene Delacroix's 1830 painting "Liberty Leading the 
People." Twenty-nine other pieces by Spero mingle with 23 of Golub's gritty 
large-scale works in the main exhibition space and in a smaller gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesser mortals might brag or gloat about snagging such a desirable spot in the 
City of Light. But enjoying the moment seems to be the best revenge for Golub 
and Spero. Too honest to pull their punches, they can tell horror stories about 
bucking the forces of Abstract Expressionism, Pop art and Minimalism from the 
1940s through the 1970s, and Spero can tell you how it feels to get laughed out 
of a New York gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 "The art world can treat you like you wouldn't believe," Golub says ruefully. 
"It can be very discouraging and demeaning." 
</P>
<P>
 Spero agrees: "And it's such a subjective thing. I mean, who's right and who's 
wrong?" Furthermore, she says, art-world opinion is fickle. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the artists are all too aware of battles that have brought them to the 
American Center -- and that their fortunes could change with the next trend -- 
one would never guess it from their demeanor. They radiate a contented sort of 
energy. And if their portrayals of violence and torture might appear to have 
been created by people you wouldn't actually want to meet, think again. 
Magnanimous, considerate and intently focused on the matter at hand, they are 
up for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition takes a long view of their careers, so we begin at the 
beginning -- with their meeting in 1946 at the Art Institute of Chicago. Spero, 
who was born in 1926 in Cleveland, was a second-year student. Golub, a Chicago 
native four years her senior who had earned a degree in art history at the 
University of Chicago, entered the institute on the GI Bill. 
</P>
<P>
 They gravitated together because of their interest in figurative imagery and 
in the unschooled expressions now known as "outsider art." But they were part 
of a group that was fraught with tension, which Golub characterizes as sexual, 
ideological and professional. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a great deal of edge in these kinds of relationships," he says, 
noting inevitable "hostilities and attractions" among young artists who are 
attempting to find themselves and their aesthetic directions. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1950, when Golub was granted his master of arts degree, Spero left Chicago 
to spend a year in Paris. Searching for the right word to describe the 
situation, he says, "Our relationship was very . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 When the word doesn't come, Spero provides one: "Strained." 
</P>
<P>
 "Friendly and strained," Golub corrects, as an entourage of curators and 
assistants bursts into laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the ice is broken, the artists plunge into their story, frequently 
talking at the same time and contradicting each other but always listening 
intently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We exchange ideas all the time, continuously. We are very frank, but neither 
one of us gets insulted by what the other one says," Golub explains. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have between us is trust, and that's fantastic," Spero confides. 
</P>
<P>
 Golub recalls that Spero sent an olive branch across the Atlantic in the form 
of an issue of Art Aujourd'hui, a French magazine that contained an article on 
art of the insane, a subject that intrigued both of them. She returned from 
Paris to Chicago in mid-1951, and they were married that December. 
</P>
<P>
 But Spero entered her new life with trepidation about maintaining her 
aesthetic identity. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time I felt that Leon had honed his skills much more than I," she 
says. "Yet I had this rather unrealistic notion that if one worked long enough, 
the work would be understood without any sort of explanation. That may have 
come from the idea the Abstract Expressionists had . . . that there's this 
emotion lying on the canvas. But I just felt that there was this long tradition 
of the art speaking for itself, forgetting that we are in the age of media and 
that there always has been some explanation or reason for art, whether it's 
come from the government or the church or whatever. When art comes from an 
individual, there's another necessity to give it a reason for entry into the 
world . . . and the artist has to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nodding admiringly, Golub says: "She has become very articulate." 
</P>
<P>
 As a young man eager for verbal exchange, Golub became a leader among 
Chicago's figurative artists in the 1950s while Spero cared for their two young 
sons and painted at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, although acutely out of step with the New York elite, Golub's work 
became known through such controversial exhibitions as the Museum of Modern 
Art's 1959 presentation "New Images of Man." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple spent a year in Italy in 1956-57 but resisted moving to New York 
because they considered it a hostile environment for their art. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that New York was not capable of accepting us on the level that our 
work called for," Golub says. "Our idea was that maybe one could 
internationalize oneself, be part of a wider world art scene." 
</P>
<P>
 They moved to Paris in 1959, beginning a five-year sojourn and an association 
with European galleries and museums. Golub was represented by Galerie Iris 
Clert in Paris. And although Spero gave birth to the third of their three sons 
in Paris, she too found outlets and appreciation for her work. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1964 the artists believed they were ready for New York, where they have 
lived and worked for the past 30 years. But while Golub earned grudging respect 
for his work and supported the family by teaching (primarily at Rutgers 
University), he didn't become a star until the early 1980s -- when figurative 
art and political themes gained critical favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Spero's rise was even slower and more painful. While living in Paris, where 
memories of World War II were still fresh, she began a series of war paintings. 
She also immersed herself in the work of Antonin Artaud, with whom she 
identified as a fellow artist who used language but was not heard by an 
uncomprehending intelligentsia. "I felt isolated and silenced," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding no interest in her work in New York's commercial galleries, she 
eventually connected with the burgeoning feminist art movement. "To my great 
interest and relief, I discovered that women artists were really analyzing the 
art scene and revealing how little power women had," Spero says. She joined the 
A.I.R. Gallery, a women's cooperative, in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was when I had to learn to speak up," she says. "I didn't know any of 
these women. And at that time I didn't even say that I had three kids and a 
husband, even a dog. . . . But eventually we all learned who we were, and I 
learned tremendously. I had to articulate my position in the operation of a 
gallery that I would be pleased to be showing with." 
</P>
<P>
 Through the years, the artists have drawn on many of the same sources but 
processed the information differently. Golub, who counts pre-Columbian and late 
Roman art and Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History -- as well as current 
international power struggles -- among his influences, says he has always 
played out his struggles externally, in aggressive images and forthright 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Spero, on the other hand, characterizes her artistic evolution as an internal 
process that has produced a relatively elegiac body of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I look at my war paintings and Artaud paintings, which are angry, 
furious work, and I wonder where the anger has gone, but I cannot stay in the 
same spot," she says. "I feel that all the work is open-ended . . . but I do 
emphasize . . . that I am a woman artist and that I have been differentiated -- 
if not overtly, implicitly -- all these years. A lot of women don't want to 
acknowledge this, of course, but it's true. It's absolutely true." 
</P>
<P>
 K line and Posner proposed Go lub's and Spero's joint retro spective in 
response to an invitation from the American Center. Although the artists rarely 
show their work together, the curators say they never considered choosing only 
one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their work has always been socially engaged. It's about the world and what 
goes on in the world," Kline says. "To look at these people who have lived 
together for 40 years and produced art together for 40 years seemed a rich way 
to explore their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the more we worked with their art, the more we (realized) -- despite the 
disparity in their scale and touch -- that there's a great deal that 
reverberates between their two bodies of imagery. There's an empathy for 
humanity and human nature that permeates both bodies of work. Even Leon's more 
brutal work is rendered with poignant compassion and empathy for this ongoing 
painful difficulty of living." 
</P>
<P>
 Summing up a two-hour conversation, Spero says: "I do know one thing about our 
relationship. We've had some successes. Mine has come relatively late. And 
we've had a lot of ups and downs. But we have always pushed each other to the 
limit. Instead of getting back, we like to push each other to the edge." 
</P>
<P>
 For once, Golub offers no rejoinder.

BREAKING THROUGH; SHE ISN'T CRAZY, SHE'S REKINDLED

 When Dionne Farris left Arrested Development, one of the most popular and 
critically acclaimed new acts of the '90s, there were two general reactions to 
her departure: Either success had gone to her head or she was plain crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is, the singer -- whose backing vocals imbued the group's 1993 
Grammy-winning hit "Tennessee" with a stirring soulfulness -- had become so 
disillusioned with the process of making music and the toll it had taken on the 
group that she had to leave in order to rekindle her passion. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a surprise given that the hip-hop collective's music was heralded for 
its positive vibes. Fans of the group assumed that the goodwill it showcased 
mirrored the real-life chemistry of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't get me wrong, I had fun," says Farris, 25, of her year with AD. "I 
learned a lot of valuable lessons. I was cushioned from a lot of things, but I 
also learned how the business is run. . . . I'm not blaming anyone. Things just 
changed. I finally had to leave for my own peace of mind. I had to see if I 
could do it on my own."  
</P>
<P>
 What she has done is release an ambitious solo album, "Wild Seed-Wild Flower," 
that encompasses hip-hop, folk, funk, rock, R&B and blues. It takes cues from 
the more introspective side of AD while bypassing that outfit's preachiness, 
though it deals audaciously with topics that range from faith and spirituality 
to domestic violence.  
</P>
<P>
 "There used to be so much substance in R&B," she says wistfully, speaking by 
phone from New York. "I know this is a business and we have to make money, but 
I think we've forgotten how to make music . . . that has some real connection 
to life." 
</P>
<P>
 Farris, raised by a single mother in Bordentown, N.J., hooked up with 
Atlanta's thriving R&B scene after moving there in 1990 and worked with the 
likes of producer Jermaine Dupri and the group TLC. Word of mouth led her to 
Arrested Development, where she became the featured vocalist but, she says, 
"never a full-fledged member, more like an extended-family member." 
</P>
<P>
 In support of her new album, Farris has embarked on a small tour that will 
land at LunaPark on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want people to come away from my concerts and my album knowing that I 
believe in the music," she says forcefully. "I want them to see that I believe 
in the rich history of black music because we've created so much, and that fact 
sometimes gets overlooked. I just hope they can take some sense of hope or 
strength from the music. It's a reassuring kind of thing I've got going on."

PRIVATE LIVES; VIDEO; A HORROR FANATIC'S SPREE DE CORPSE; WE ASKED ROCKER AND 
COMPOSER DANNY ELFMAN, CREATOR OF CREEPY MUSIC FOR COOL FILMS, TO PICK THE BEST 
MOVIES TO RENT FOR HALLOWEEN.

 'You realize what you're ask ing me to do is next to impossible," Danny Elfman 
says when asked to name his 10 favorite movies to rent on Halloween. "I'm a 
horror fanatic of major proportions." 
</P>
<P>
 Elfman, 41, who leads a dual life as the singer-songwriter of the Los Angeles 
band Boingo and the composer of scores for such films as "Edward Scissorhands," 
"Beetlejuice" and both "Batman" movies, is somewhat of an expert on horror 
films, and he thinks Halloween's a good time to watch them. 
</P>
<P>
 One good bet this year, he says, is "Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas," 
which was recently released on video. Elfman wrote the Grammy-nominated music 
for the stop-motion animated film and also provided the singing voice of Jack 
Skellington, the bony Pumpkin King. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think anyone who might be into the movie would enjoy it on Halloween," 
Elfman says. "Of course, I'm biased." 
</P>
<P>
 Elfman himself rarely gets the chance to rent movies on All Hallow's Eve -- 
he's busy putting on Boingo's almost-annual Halloween concerts (for seven of 
the last eight years). This year's shows are at the Universal Amphitheatre 
tonight, Monday (both sold out) and Tuesday (tickets available through 
Ticketmaster). 
</P>
<P>
 But for those more inclined to stay home and rent than go out and rock, here 
are Elfman's favorite flicks for Halloween. He couldn't limit it to 10, though. 
Here are the lucky 13, which, he says, "are all worth searching out": 
</P>
<P>
 1. "The Shining" (1980). "That falls into the adult category," Elfman says of 
director Stanley Kubrick's film of the Stephen King novel. "It's one of the 
best done of its genre. . . . And, of course, I love it because (the twin 
girls) are saying, 'Hello, Danny,' so they're talking to me. 'Come play with us 
forever and ever,' and I'm always going, 'Uh, OK.' " 
</P>
<P>
 2. "The Haunting" (1963). Elfman enjoys watching this chilling haunted house 
film because it's a "classic ghost movie" that director Robert Wise made all 
the more powerful by the absence of on-screen spirits. "It's very imaginative 
the way they put it together, making a scary movie without ever showing any 
prosthetic makeup or scary images in your face. (That's) kind of a hard thing 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
 3. "The Beast With Five Fingers" (1946). This tale about an aging pianist was 
the film that scared Elfman most -- he was 7 when he first saw it. "It's silly, 
but it's really fun," he says. "It's a classic Peter Lorre performance." 
</P>
<P>
 4. (Tie) "Evil Dead II" (1987) and "Dawn of the Dead" (1978). "Both of these 
movies make me laugh so hard while I'm enjoying them, as gore often does," 
Elfman says of these funny gross-out flicks. "There's something about malls and 
flesh-eating zombies. Getting disemboweled by zombies in a mall is classic 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 5. "Bride of Frankenstein" (1935). Elfman calls this classic "one of the 
original great horror movies," partly because of its Franz Waxman musical 
score, which he ranks alongside the score to "King Kong" as one of the best -- 
and earliest -- scores ever written. "(But) 'King Kong' doesn't rank up with 
'Bride of Frankenstein' for Halloween," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 6. (Tie) "Tales of Terror" (1962) and "The Raven" (1963). These Roger 
Corman-directed movies that featured Vincent Price and Peter Lorre "were my 
best-loved movies somewhere between the ages of 10 and 13," Elfman says. 
"They're still fantastic. They're fun." 
</P>
<P>
 7. "Black Sabbath" (1964). This three-part horror film hosted by Boris Karloff 
is an Elfman favorite mostly because of the middle story directed by Mario 
Bava. "It's a really scary half-hour piece," Elfman says. "The other stories 
are OK, but this one's a classic." 
</P>
<P>
 8. (Tie) "The Brain That Wouldn't Die" (1963) and "Eyes Without a Face" (1959) 
(also known as "The Horror Chamber of Dr. Faustus"). These low-budget horror 
flicks revolving around crazed surgeons tie as Elfman favorites in the 
"low-budget films of my youth" category. "Great, cheesy (movies)," he says. 
"They can't be beat." 
</P>
<P>
 9. "Repulsion" (1965). "Now we're moving into the Danny Elfman, young teen-age 
auteur (category)," he says of this unsettling film directed by Roman Polanski. 
"This is a perennial favorite. One of my teen-age birthday parties was spent 
getting very (messed) up, seeing 'Repulsion' and returning home for a rabbit 
dinner. If you see the movie you'll know why." 
</P>
<P>
 10. "Eraserhead" (1978). "It's just one of the best films ever made," Elfman 
says of this David Lynch-directed cult favorite. "I think it's got enough 
tie-in with Halloween. . . . There was nothing about it I didn't like. It's 
just filled with great imagery."*

MOTHER'S PUSH FOR JUSTICE REOPENS CASE; INQUIRY: REBECCA ENNIS HIRED 
INVESTIGATOR WHO FOUND NEW EVIDENCE IN THE SLAYING OF HER SON. PROSECUTORS 
DEFEND THEIR ACTIONS. 
</P>

<P>
 From the start, the shooting of James Vleck has baffled authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 When his body was found in a Ventura apartment house in August, 1993, Vleck 
was clutching an unopened knife in his hand but had no identification on him. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and coroner's officials combed the Silver Strand area and talked with 
surfers, skateboarders and business owners before they found someone who could 
recognize the 23-year-old former Oxnard man. 
</P>
<P>
 But an even bigger puzzle for them, authorities later discovered, was finding 
the truth behind Vleck's shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 First there was the story of Dean Soto, the Ventura nightclub disc jockey who 
told police he shot Vleck while trying to make a citizen's arrest. Soto said he 
pointed a 9-millimeter semiautomatic at Vleck and told him he was under arrest 
for harassing a woman Soto knew. Vleck, he said, took a swing at him and 
grabbed the loaded pistol. The gun went off. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors spent four months examining the case before deciding they could 
find no evidence of criminal conduct. It was, they concluded in December, 1993, 
a citizen's arrest gone awry. They ruled the shooting accidental and closed the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Dissatisfied with the results, Vleck's mother hired a private investigator. He 
discovered that prosecutors had never interviewed the only other witness to the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 That witness, Paul Skill, said Vleck never tried to grab the gun. Instead, 
Vleck was merely trying to move out of harm's way when Soto shot him, Skill 
told the private investigator in March. The investigator, Jeff Bogan, also 
noticed that certain details in a coroner's report seemed to support what Skill 
had told him. 
</P>
<P>
 Confronted with the new evidence, the district attorney's office has reopened 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The move came as the state attorney general's office has begun investigating 
whether local prosecutors abused their discretionary power by not filing 
charges in the matter initially. Prosecutors defend their probe and their 
initial conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "When all is said and done here, I think the record will show we did a good 
job," Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin J. McGee said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vleck's mother, Rebecca Ennis, doesn't see it that way. Prosecutors, she 
said, "just wanted to brush it under the carpet." 
</P>
<P>
 "I not only have to deal with the fact that my son is gone," said Ennis, who 
now lives in Arizona, "I have to deal with the fact that I can't get through to 
the district attorneys." 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation of Vleck's death is just one of hundreds each year that 
prosecutors choose not to pursue in court -- decisions that often leave the 
victims' families or police officers dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Ventura County prosecutors rejected 21% of the 4,380 investigations 
police brought to them, or 946 cases. The rejection rate as of mid-October was 
22%, or 957 cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not typically considered to be an office that shies away from a 
difficult case," McGee said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Vleck shooting was riddled with complications. 
</P>
<P>
 First, there was the victim's background. Vleck had a history of drug use and, 
despite receiving treatment, had been on a binge in the weeks before his death. 
The autopsy report showed traces of methamphetamine in his body. What's more, 
he was carrying a knife the day of his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Soto was carrying three loaded handguns and was later convicted of felony drug 
possession in an unrelated case. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, there was the nature of the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Skill was never fully questioned by police or prosecutors until the case was 
closed. With no conflicting story, prosecutors did not look for discrepancies 
that would later emerge from the coroner's report. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors would not discuss the details of this case because of the ongoing 
investigation. But in general, they say they press charges only when they 
sincerely believe a suspect is "guilty beyond a reasonable doubt." Otherwise, 
they say, they stand little chance of winning a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, on the other hand, have a lower legal standard for making an arrest -- 
probable cause that a crime was committed. As a result, the district attorney's 
office does not always prosecute every case brought by police. 
</P>
<P>
 When that occurs, as it does in one in five felony cases, the cooperative 
nature of the police-prosecutor relationship can sour, officials acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are times here at the Ventura Police Department that we feel the case 
is provable beyond a reasonable doubt, and we just disagree" with prosecutors, 
said Ventura Police Chief Richard Thomas. Nonetheless, Thomas said the two 
agencies work hard to smooth out problems and keep the tension to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 What is clear in this case is that police believe Soto had no business 
pointing the loaded gun at Vleck. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shooting was unnecessary," said Ventura Police Sgt. Bob Anderson, who 
commands the major crimes division. "The players there had ample opportunity to 
summon the police, who are paid to handle disputes of that nature. And we 
weren't given that opportunity. It's a tragedy that should not have happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Soto did not return several phone calls seeking comment for this story. But he 
gave this version of events in his statement to police the night of the 
shooting: 
</P>
<P>
 The night before, Soto, 30, was attending a barbecue at the East Thompson 
Boulevard apartment of his girlfriend, Samantha McCranie, when he noticed Vleck 
behind the house playing with a knife. Vleck had attended McCranie's barbecue 
and met her roommates. 
</P>
<P>
 Early the next evening, McCranie phoned to tell him that Vleck had returned to 
the apartment, Soto said. She told him Vleck had climbed through a window, 
pushed one of her roommates and made a remark that he could rape her if he 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Soto said he quickly went to his girlfriend's aid, armed with three handguns. 
</P>
<P>
 When he saw Vleck and Skill approaching the apartment sometime after 7 p.m. on 
Aug. 9, Soto reached into his duffel bag and pulled out a .357 Magnum. He said 
he considered the gun too large for protection, so he reached back into the bag 
and pulled out the 9-millimeter. He said he unholstered that gun and slipped it 
behind his back. 
</P>
<P>
 He confronted the men as soon as they came through the front door and ordered 
them to "freeze," Soto said. But Vleck, Soto told police, swung at him and 
grabbed the gun. 
</P>
<P>
 That is how he was shot, Soto said. 
</P>
<P>
 Skill, who came into the apartment with Vleck, recalled events differently, 
according to police statements taken in June, nearly a year later. In the 
moments after the shooting, police interviewed Skill briefly and took down a 
statement that seemed to confirm Soto's story. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Bogan, the private investigator, contacted Skill months later, he 
heard a different story. The investigator relayed the information to police, 
who conducted another interview with the eyewitness. 
</P>
<P>
 Skill told the police: 
</P>
<P>
 He picked up Vleck hitchhiking earlier that same day and drove him around as 
he ran some errands. Vleck wanted to go back to the apartment to get a tattoo 
by one of the women in the apartment, Skill said. 
</P>
<P>
 When they arrived at the apartment with Vleck carrying his tattoo box, 
everything seemed fine. In fact, Skill said he thought Vleck had been staying 
there because McCranie met them out front and escorted them inside the 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 But as soon as he and Vleck entered the living room, Soto appeared out of 
nowhere and held the loaded pistol on them. Skill said he thought they had 
walked into a robbery in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Soto got up really close to Vleck with the gun, pressing the gun into his 
body, Skill said. He said Vleck tried to move out of the way but was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When police found Vleck, he had his knife clutched in his hand. It was never 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy revealed that Soto's gun was indeed pressed against Vleck's left 
biceps when he was shot, Ventura County Medical Examiner Ronald L. O'Halloran 
said. It also showed that Vleck's arm was not extended, as if he had been 
lunging out to grab at something, but was down by his side at the time of 
death, said the coroner. 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Halloran said prosecutors had not asked him to review the witness 
statements to determine which one was more consistent with the autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been asked that question," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In reopening the case, prosecutors interviewed Skill for the first time this 
month. While they continue to investigate, the state attorney general's office 
has suspended its own inquiry.  
</P>
<P>
 Vleck's mother, Rebecca Ennis, who has spent nearly $20,000 in her campaign to 
bring the case to court, is happy prosecutors are reconsidering the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "When my son was laying there, I told him I was going to get justice," she 
said. "I can't give up. I am going to die trying."

ELECTIONS / SCHOOL BOARD; CONSERVATIVE TRUSTEE MAY BE JOINED BY OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since her election two years ago, Ventura County School Board member Wendy 
Larner often has voted alone. 
</P>
<P>
 On issues ranging from sex education to a pay raise for the county schools 
superintendent, Larner has been the sole trustee opposing the four-member 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
 But she may not be alone much longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other candidates embracing some of the same conservative views as Larner 
are running for three available seats in November. 
</P>
<P>
 If even only two of them win, their viewpoint may hold sway on the county 
school board. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, Walt Madrid, executive director of the conservative group 
Citizens for Truth in Education and a member of the local chapter of the 
Christian Coalition, is vying against incumbent Al Rosen and attorney Daniel R. 
Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative Christian homemaker Angela N. Miller is opposing incumbent 
Juanita Sanchez-Valdez, and college teacher Jeffrey N. Moss is in the race for 
the seat representing the Oxnard and Ventura area. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Thousand Oaks, businessman Marty Bates is challenging incumbent 
Doylenne G. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Bates shares certain views with Madrid and Miller that distinguish the three 
from other candidates in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the eight candidates, they are the only ones who support Proposition 187, 
the ballot initiative that would ban illegal immigrants from public school 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The three share something else: They decided to run for the board after the 
firing of county schools Principal Dan Flynn.  
</P>
<P>
 The county board approves the budget and oversees policy for 17 county-run 
schools and programs serving youngsters who are severely disabled, who have run 
into trouble with the law or who have been kicked out of their home districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn was principal of the three schools for youths who are in jail or 
juvenile hall when he ran in the June election against his boss, County Schools 
Supt. Charles Weis, for Weis' job. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn lost, but it wasn't his defeat that galvanized his supporters to run for 
the county board. It was his firing by Weis less than three weeks after the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the superintendent said he dismissed Flynn solely because of poor job 
performance, many Flynn supporters suggested the firing smacked of political 
revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the first board meeting after his dismissal, about two dozen Flynn 
supporters showed up to protest the action. Madrid, Miller and Bates were 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Some political observers said the race amounts to a poll of the public's views 
of Weis versus Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a referendum on the firing of Dan Flynn," said Michael Dunn, who 
represents Thousand Oaks on the county's Republican Central Committee. "If you 
think that firing was justified, vote for Chuck Weis. If you think it was mean 
and uncalled-for, vote for Walt Madrid, Marty Bates and Angela Miller." 
</P>
<P>
 Weis agrees that the board race seems to be partly about him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow it seems they are trying to get back at me for doing my job," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 After the firing, Flynn supporters turned their ire not only on the 
superintendent but also on the board, demanding that trustees overturn Weis' 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 But board members said their hands were tied. 
</P>
<P>
 While local school boards appoint their superintendents and also make 
decisions about firing teachers and principals, the county board has an elected 
superintendent who is solely responsible for personnel decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months after Flynn's firing, the issue is still fueling some candidates' 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Miller says one of her first tasks as trustee would be to review 
Flynn's firing. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Ventura County counsel and the state attorney general have issued 
opinions that only the county superintendent has jurisdiction over hiring and 
firing, but Miller wants to get additional legal interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a 43-year-old housewife, Miller formerly worked as a singer with rock 'n' 
roll bands. She left that career after experiencing a religious conversion, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Larner, Miller opposes sex-education programs that include information 
about contraceptives. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All the other candidates, including Madrid and Bates, say they favor teaching 
about contraceptives while also promoting sexual abstinence among youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides changing the sex-education program in county-run schools, Miller said 
she hopes to influence teacher training throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The county board votes on grant funding for some of the hundreds of workshops 
the county superintendent's office holds each year for public school teachers. 
Like Larner, Miller said she is particularly concerned about workshops on sex 
and AIDS education. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller is running against incumbent Sanchez-Valdez and the third candidate, 
Moss, in the race to represent the Ventura and Oxnard area. 
</P>
<P>
 Appointed to the board in 1993 to replace a trustee who resigned, 
Sanchez-Valdez, 64, is a retired educator. She taught for 10 years in private 
Catholic schools in Los Angeles and worked 21 years in the Oxnard School 
District, including as a principal and district administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she said she also wants to investigate whether the board could expand 
its powers over personnel matters, she said her main interest in serving as 
trustee is the disabled and troubled children in county-run schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm interested in children with problems," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez-Valdez said her 24 years in this county help make her an effective 
trustee. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller moved to the county from Los Angeles in 1990, while Moss, a Los Angeles 
native, came from Santa Barbara to Ventura one year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss has received the endorsements of the county's Unity Pride Coalition, a 
liberal gay-rights group, and the Ventura County Federation of School 
Employees, the union representing about 200 educators at the county-run 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides teaching part time at Cal State Northridge, Moss is working toward his 
Ph.D. in education at UC Santa Barbara. He also has 20 years' experience 
working with nonprofit groups for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his goals, he said, is to ensure that the county schools office and 
local districts are not duplicating each other's efforts in areas like special 
education and drug-use prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 He emphasizes that he has no specific agenda to push on the county board. "I 
don't believe in any one philosophy," he said. "I'm here to represent the 
people of this district." 
</P>
<P>
 And he said he decided to run partly out of a concern that conservative 
Christians may take control of the board. 
</P>
<P>
 The same concern helped motivate Gonzalez in Simi Valley to enter the race for 
the seat representing that area. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 39-year-old attorney, who was endorsed by the union of county schools 
employees, shares at least one goal with the more conservative candidates: He 
believes county trustees should show more independence from Weis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they basically rubber-stamp a lot of policies that come across their 
desk," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 A past board president of the Simi Valley Free Clinic and past president of 
the Simi Valley Bar Assn., Gonzalez is now a vice president of the Ventura 
County Mexican-American Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected, Gonzalez said he would try to get businesses, police and churches 
more involved in county schools to help steer youths away from crime and into 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the Simi Valley race are incumbent Rosen and candidate Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
 Elected in 1989, Rosen, 67, has 12 years' experience as a substitute and 
full-time teacher in the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen said he wants to be reelected because of his long experience in 
education. "I spent so many years in the system," he said. "I've lived 
education." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Moss, Rosen said he wants to eliminate duplication of programs between 
local districts and the county superintendent's office. 
</P>
<P>
 And while he denied charges that the board lacks independence, Rosen said he 
has a great deal of confidence in Weis and other administrators in the 
superintendent's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the county schools office has become a favorite target of some 
conservatives, the third candidate in the Simi Valley race -- Walt Madrid -- 
said he is enthusiastic about some programs run by the county superintendent, 
like the training of principals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Active in conservative groups, Madrid sides with the conservative Christian 
movement in his support of taxpayer-funded vouchers for private school tuition 
and other issues. But he differs in his support for teaching students about 
both contraceptives and sexual abstinence. 
</P>
<P>
 Madrid, who works as a purchasing agent for a Westlake Village military 
hardware company, is also distancing himself from the furor over the firing of 
Flynn, even though it was that issue that sparked Madrid's interest in the 
county school board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably get condemned for this," he said, but county trustees should 
put the Flynn episode behind them. "That has to do with the prior board." 
</P>
<P>
 If elected, Madrid said, he would try to keep voters better informed about the 
board by holding regular meetings for constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 Bates is making the same campaign pledge in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Contending that trustees have done a poor job of representing voters, Bates 
said he would meet with interested residents before all board meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner of two small companies that market high-tech devices used in medical 
care, Bates, 57, said his business experience would help him guide the board's 
review of school budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Larner and Miller, Bates said he is interested in reviewing the 
teacher-training workshops run through the county schools office. 
</P>
<P>
 Students need to learn more of the basics in reading, writing and arithmetic, 
he said. And teacher training may be the place to start with this change in 
emphasis. "Those are the areas everyone complains about. So those are the areas 
where we need to give teachers information." 
</P>
<P>
 Bates is challenging incumbent Doylenne Johnson, who was appointed to the 
board six years ago and who ran unopposed in her first election. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she now works full time as a supervisor at the Broadway department 
store at The Oaks mall, Johnson was for many years a homemaker who volunteered 
with the local and state Parent-Teacher Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she takes a special interest in the students served by the county 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children at risk are the faceless children of the community," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said she was also concerned about Flynn's firing. But she said 
trustees "are caught between a rock and a hard place" because of their 
inability to act on personnel matters.

KEY BILLS BY DELEGATION BECOME LAW; LEGISLATURE: AREA REPUBLICANS FOCUS ON 
CRIME AND BUSINESS. DEMOCRATS ALSO SCORE SUCCESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The surge of crime-busting sentiment that capped the final year of the 1993-94 
legislative session created a political climate more favorable than usual to 
Ventura County's Republican lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a year of whipping criminals and the economy into shape. And, with Gov. 
Pete Wilson's reelection hopes setting the agenda, the county's Republican 
legislators succeeded in getting a number of anti-crime and pro-business bills 
signed into law. 
</P>
<P>
 The normally low-profile Assemblywoman Paula Boland (R-Granada Hills), for 
instance, prospered with topical bills addressing the needs of victims of rape, 
sexual molestation and other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Nao Takasugi (R-Oxnard), an advocate for the business community, 
got a boost in his first term as a result of the emphasis on California's 
economic recovery. State Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) succeeded in 
getting nearly every one of her bills signed to reduce the burden of hazardous 
waste regulations on business. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Democrats did score some key successes. After years of trying, 
Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) won the Republican governor's 
signature on a bill to protect the coastline from new offshore oil drilling. 
</P>
<P>
 And state Sen. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara) won support and Wilson's signature 
for legislation disarming domestic violence offenders and students who carry 
guns to school. But he lost on some critical educational issues that he had 
supported for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart -- with 20 years' experience in the Capitol, the most veteran member of 
the county's delegation -- expressed a measure of discontent with the two-year 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think this session of the Legislature measures up," Hart said, noting 
his setbacks in education funding, classroom testing and education reform. "It 
was a bit of a disappointment in comparison to other years." 
</P>
<P>
 From the other side of the aisle, however, Takasugi voiced a more favorable 
impression. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt good about having a part in getting legislation passed to help 
businesses," he said, citing in particular reform of the workers' compensation 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a glance at some of the highlights of the 1993-94 legislative session 
for each delegation member: Paula Boland 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman 
</P>
<P>
 In her role as vice chairwoman of the Assembly Public Safety Committee, Boland 
takes credit for helping win votes for some tough-on-crime bills such as the 
one-strike and three-strikes sentencing measures in the governor's package. 
</P>
<P>
 The bills she successfully authored and got signed into law include one 
forbidding prison inmates from changing their names, another requiring 
disclosure of HIV test results to rape victims, and another expanding the 
statute of limitations for child molestation cases. 
</P>
<P>
 She also stepped in with a new law to protect the privacy of jurors -- after 
information published about jurors in the Simi Valley trial of Los Angeles 
motorist Rodney King resulted in the harassment of some panel members. 
</P>
<P>
 Boland said she also considers crucial her new law giving federal peace 
officers the authority to step in during a state of emergency to serve 
alongside local law enforcement personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Boland also strongly touts the pro-business philosophy of her party leaders. 
In a ranking of state legislators, the California Chamber of Commerce gave her 
a perfect score for casting votes on its side -- the only 100% rating given to 
a county lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have to realize is that business means jobs. And jobs mean Mom and 
Dad are working," Boland said. "That means a healthy environment for the 
family, and a healthy economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 47 bills Boland introduced in the two-year session, 15 were signed into 
law. Jack O'Connell 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman 
</P>
<P>
 In obtaining the governor's signature for the California Coastal Sanctuary 
Act, O'Connell played up the kinds of benefits that Wilson likes: "It's 
designed to help our fishing industry and tourist industry -- and protect our 
coastline," O'Connell says. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law forbids any new drilling projects within state waters that stretch 
three miles out to sea, along the entire 1,100-mile California coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell also wrote a new law to rid the legal code of outmoded 19th-Century 
statutes. His bill to require elder care and adult care workers to undergo 
background checks was signed into law, and so was a bill requiring Caltrans to 
post signs citing local points of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell set up a new California Strawberry Commission, but lost on an issue 
that appealed to those trying to re-establish the California condor in Ventura 
County: Wilson vetoed a bill requiring makers of antifreeze and coolant to add 
bittering agents to their products, thus making the syrupy liquids unpalatable 
to animals in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 For O'Connell, the most disappointing veto, however, was of a bill to expand 
funding for community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 If he had one overriding regret, O'Connell said, it was over the snail's pace 
at which the state is moving to build a four-year college campus in Ventura 
County. "We need to move with more dispatch toward making a public four-year 
institution a reality," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 38 bills O'Connell introduced, 24 were signed into law. Nao Takasugi 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman 
</P>
<P>
 When Takasugi arrived in the Legislature two years ago, he was floored at how 
deep the partisan divisions ran and how tardy everyone was to meetings and 
legislative sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he says, "I'm beginning to understand the system better. But I still find 
it very frustrating being in the minority party." 
</P>
<P>
 Takasugi has noticed that bills he favors -- those that further Republican 
goals -- sometimes die in committees controlled by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 But Takasugi's bills in his second year fared well. Of 18 bills he introduced, 
he said, 12 passed and were signed into law. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them were a handful of measures exempting income or products from 
taxation. Now, a whistle-blower's cash reward for calling a crime hot line will 
no longer be subject to state income taxes. And elderly patients buying meals 
in rest homes will no longer have to pay a sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Takasugi also got a permanent extension of a state program to settle tax 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor also signed a Takasugi bill requiring three state agencies to 
review security measures at their field offices as a result of the Oxnard 
unemployment office killings. And the assemblyman secured a new law requiring 
notification of educators when trouble-making students guilty of serious crimes 
are returned to public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 As the first Asian American to serve in the Legislature in 12 years, Takasugi 
co-authored a bill to recognize Asian Americans as identifiable sectors of 
California's population as counted by the state Department of Finance. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 36 bills Takasugi authored, 17 were signed into law. Cathie Wright 
</P>
<P>
 State Senator 
</P>
<P>
 In the second year of her first state Senate term, Wright continued her march 
through a 2-inch-thick hazardous waste handling law, looking for ways to 
simplify and streamline it. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, who took up the issue in the Assembly before getting elected to the 
state Senate in 1992, has said one of her main goals is to reduce the burden 
that such laws place on small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 As vice chairwoman of the Toxics and Public Safety Management Committee, 
Wright has advanced a number of bills to reduce paperwork and red tape for 
businesses that handle toxic material. 
</P>
<P>
 She has obtained Wilson's signature on about 15 bills to refine existing laws 
calling for regulation and inspection of any business that handles hazardous 
waste -- from hospitals to large photo processing outfits. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright also got signed into law a bill toughening probation requirements for 
sexual offenders and child molesters. 
</P>
<P>
 For earthquake victims, she pushed through a law exempting taxpayers from late 
penalties if quake damage prevented them from filing tax payments on time. The 
new law also removed penalties for early withdrawal from individual retirement 
accounts in hardship cases brought on by the Jan. 17 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Before progressing even halfway through her four-year term, Wright decided she 
would run for higher office as the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor. 
She could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 52 bills Wright introduced, 28 were signed into law. Gary Hart 
</P>
<P>
 State Senator 
</P>
<P>
 If Boland's efforts got a leg up by this year's get-tough mood in the 
Legislature and the governor's office, then Hart's agenda may have suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart reported getting a higher number of vetoes than usual from Wilson, 
particularly on some of the state senator's more visionary education-related 
bills: a measure to fund and reshape the CLAS test, another to allow increased 
school property taxes following a majority vote instead of a two-thirds vote, 
and another to permit more schools to break off from districts and become

 "I thought these were bills that the governor could see fit to sign," Hart 
said. "But instead he suckered down anything that wasn't 'three strikes and 
you're out.' Any changes other than 'law and order' went down this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart, one of the top-rated lawmakers in the Capitol, is in his last term. He 
is expected to announce a new career -- probably in education and based in 
Sacramento, he says -- after the first of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his new laws is one that stemmed from the Oxnard state unemployment 
office shooting rampage that left five dead. The measure increases benefits for 
survivors of state workers killed in the line of duty from a few months' 
payment to a lifetime stipend. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also signed a Hart measure that starts the statute of limitations clock 
when an oil spill is discovered, rather than when it occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Another successful Hart law helps ease the state's transition from a 
defense-reliant economy by creating the California Defense Conversion Council. 
</P>

VALENTINO'S BEACH PARTY; COMMUNITIES HOLLYWOOD MADE FAMOUS STILL RESIST 
ANNEXATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rudolph Valentino posed in Arabian costume among the large dunes outside 
Oxnard while filming "The Sheik" during the 1920s, and real estate hucksters 
quickly billed the barren beaches as the next movie oasis. 
</P>
<P>
 But the vision proved as fleeting as Valentino himself, and Hollywood hype 
gave way to shabby vacation shacks and rollicking beer bars which, in turn, are 
now being replaced by million-dollar homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the independent spirit that is the essence of the old-time ocean 
communities known as Silver Strand, Hollywood-by-the-Sea and Hollywood Beach 
has survived in every incarnation. 
</P>
<P>
 From the 1940s, when military families settled along the oceanfront in Quonset 
huts to the 1970s, when Los Angeles area residents realized it was one of the 
last stretches of affordable beachfront property in Southern California, the 
community has maintained a strong, eclectic identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by Oxnard and the Port Hueneme naval base, divided by the Channel 
Islands Harbor, the beaches and their 5,900 residents have managed to remain 
independent of any city. And the countless battles they have fought to save the 
beaches from annexation have created a lasting bond between bohemians and 
retirees, renters and homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all individualists, but if some outside influence tries to come in and 
mess with us, we unite," said James Bennett, a Hollywood Beach resident for 30 
years. "And when we unite, we're very strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of attempts by Oxnard and Port Hueneme to take over the beaches -- 
increasingly wealthy due to an influx of Angelenos -- have been blocked over 
the years by savvy residents with help from county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the elected leaders of the Channel Islands Beach Community Services 
District, which was created to provide water and remove trash but has ended up 
doing much more, proclaim that it is the ultimate vehicle of democracy, far 
more responsive to residents' needs than the slothful governments of adjacent 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 With change has come uncertainty, however, and some old-timers wonder whether 
two recent community improvement projects -- mostly paid for by assessing 
homeowners $7.7 million -- were a thinly veiled drive to rid the beach of the 
remaining middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been fighting to keep the beach as it was, but they want to turn it into 
Newport Beach," said George Johnson, a resident of Silver Strand for 36 years. 
"It's impossible for people of normal means to move here now." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Others worry that the mistakes of other nascent beach communities have been 
forgotten and the character of the area they have lived in for decades has been 
forever altered. 
</P>
<P>
 "This really used to be a different lifestyle here, really bohemian," said 
Patrick Forrest, a member of the district's board of directors. "It's the 
Encino lifestyle now." 
</P>
<P>
 And community leaders say that unless rising utility costs are curbed, the 
growing beach communities may not wish to remain sovereign much longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can't be competitive economically," asks board President Frank Chiella, 
"how much are people willing to pay for independence?" 
</P>
<P>
 The massive dunes of what was once called Oxnard Beach were desolate until 
1921, when Paramount filmmakers placed hundreds of fake palm trees in the sand 
and shot a passionate romance starring an obscure bit actor named Valentino. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sheik" became the box office sensation of its time, and fans soon started 
driving from Los Angeles to Oxnard to frolic on the beach and see the natural 
spring featured as the movie's oasis. 
</P>
<P>
 Developer William Lingenbrink saw a way to make a buck, longtime residents 
say, by selling tiny beach lots to star-struck Los Angeles area residents 
seeking to meet their idols. 
</P>
<P>
 After making a deal with the McGrath family for the seemingly worthless 
property, the subdivision named Hollywood Beach was born in June, 1924. 
</P>
<P>
 Flyers placed on porches throughout Pasadena and the San Fernando Valley 
advertised the affordability -- $200 a lot -- of owning a vacation home where 
"The Sheik" was shot. By the end of that summer, all 502 lots had been sold, 
and Lingenbrink had taken in $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Other prospectors quickly took notice, and the Silver Strand and 
Hollywood-by-the-Sea subdivisions were created in 1925 and 1926. By 1927, about 
110 houses existed on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most colorful was "The Driftwood," a cottage built entirely of scrap 
lumber, sandstone and floating debris, with a chandelier made from a steering 
wheel. It still stands today.  
</P>
<P>
 At their peak of popularity, up to 2,500 visitors crammed the beaches on 
weekends while rum runners anchored off the coast at night and shipped 
10-gallon booze containers to shore on rafts. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many stars of the silent era shot movies, partied and relaxed at the 
beach -- including Carole Lombard, Eleanor Boardman and James Murray -- few if 
any bought homes, and the area never became a movie colony. 
</P>
<P>
 And contrary to myth, Valentino, who was always short of money, never bought 
any property at the beach and probably never went back after "The Sheik," 
historians say. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the "New Hollywood" hype used to launch the beach communities 
lingered for years, fueled by the occasional movie star sighting, and is still 
professed by some realtors today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard a lot of fanciful tales," Bennett said, laughing. "A lot of the 
movie people came out here and partied, but I think the majority of it is 
concocted. One gal -- she's dead now -- swore that the ghost of Robert Taylor 
walked in her home." 
</P>
<P>
 With the arrival of the Depression, the beaches' golden era faded almost as 
quickly as it had begun. Lots were sold or abandoned, businesses moved 
elsewhere, and the shifting sands began to cover up the streets on Ocean Drive, 
the coastal road linking the three communities. 
</P>
<P>
 During World War II, military personnel from the Port Hueneme naval base came 
to the area with their families. Many of the sailors stayed at the beach after 
the war or came back on summer vacations, and a strip of beer bars with names 
like the Hop Inn, the Sea Shell and Eli's Dunes attracted party-goers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ocean Drive was lined with these little beer joints, and that's where 
everyone went," said Wanda Pirkle, who moved to Oxnard in 1946, married a 
sailor and moved to Silver Strand. "You would start at one end, make your way 
across to the other end and make your way back. It was a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 The bar-hopping jaunts ended about 1956, however, when longstanding plans for 
a small-craft harbor in the swampy area behind the beaches gained momentum, 
reshaping the communities forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and businesses in the harbor's path were bought out or condemned 
before the Army Corps of Engineers began digging the waterway in 1960, and 
Hollywood by-the-Sea and the bar strip along Ocean Drive were cut in half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Channel Islands Harbor, opened in 1965, brought a new surge of boaters and 
visitors to the area. As Los Angeles suburbanites began to rediscover the 
beaches, the makeup began to change, creating a conflict between 
community-minded residents and freewheeling party-goers. 
</P>
<P>
 The new wave of professionals claimed they were only trying to clean up the 
area's image, but the more bohemian older residents said they really sought to 
homogenize the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a live-and-let-live kind of place," said Ruth Johnson, who moved from 
Pennsylvania to Silver Strand in 1958 with her husband, George. "Then a group 
of people moved in who wanted every blade of grass to go in the same 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate prices skyrocketed during the 1970s, as Angelenos bought vacation 
homes at the beach with aplomb. Many later retired to the ocean, turning the 
beaches into a wealthy enclave. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could buy a beachfront cottage for $20,000 to $30,000 in the early 
1970s," said Ralph Ennis of Ennis and Ennis Realty in Hollywood Beach. "The 
beachfront has become so expensive now that it's probably limited to doctors, 
lawyers and corporate heads." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute between old-timers and new arrivals over the changing communities 
was put aside in 1979, however, when Oxnard threatened to annex the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with the possible loss of their independence, residents banded together 
and blocked the takeover in 1980 with the help of Supervisor John K. Flynn at 
the Local Agency Formation Commission, the state agency that presides over 
annexations. 
</P>
<P>
 Unhappy with their unincorporated status but loath to join Oxnard or Port 
Hueneme, beach residents became interested in forming a community services 
district, and Flynn agreed to facilitate the process. 
</P>
<P>
 The Channel Islands Beach Community Services District -- the first such 
governing body in Ventura County -- was born in 1982, when 58% of the 
community's residents approved its formation. 
</P>
<P>
 After interviewing 80 candidates, the five elected board members chose Gerard 
Kapuscik, a brainy young Flynn aide, as the district's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Government insiders said Kapuscik was too qualified for the position, which 
puts him in charge of the provision of utilities and removal of rubbish. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents said he had the connections the district needed to be a player 
in regional politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew where all the skeletons were buried in all the closets throughout the 
county," Bennett said. "He knows how to get things done. He's a real jewel." 
</P>
<P>
 Kapuscik and the board soon found themselves in an imbroglio over a plan in 
1985 to resurface eroding streets, place unsightly utility wires underground 
and construct storm drains to reduce rampant flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 The seemingly innocuous project proved to be the most controversial episode in 
the district's history, dividing residents over its Gargantuan costs and 
leading to a bizarre recall episode in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 County, state and federal agencies agreed to contribute $4.5 million for the 
improvements, but the remaining $5.5 million needed to come from residents 
through an assessment district. 
</P>
<P>
 After a separate $2.2-million assessment district for water service 
improvements was also proposed in 1988, some old-timers questioned the board's 
true motives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The assessment districts were just a tool to remove the poorer people," said 
George Johnson, who organized a drive to recall all five board members. "They 
just want the peasants off the beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before the recall election, board members William J. Higgins and Kathy 
Silveri changed their minds and decided to oppose the assessments, shocking 
their colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Higgins and Silveri did not get the response they had expected, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "In an ironic twist of fate, their strategy backfired and those two were 
recalled," Kapuscik said. "Most people supported the improvements." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the projects once again brought out the old differences between 
generations of residents about the future of their communities, and the tension 
surrounding the incident lingers today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the people who opposed the project now call me and say it was a good 
thing, but it was not unanimous by any means," Flynn said. "There was a lot of 
protests, and some people are still upset about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia Marcus, a native of West Los Angeles, bought a vacation home on 
Hollywood Beach in 1979 and later moved to the area with her husband. She said 
she pushed for the improvements not to drive poorer people from the beaches but 
because they were necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are a lot of people who are frightened of the future," said 
Marcus, who was appointed to the board last year and is now seeking election. 
"They don't want anything to change. But if you don't move forward, you fall 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the beaches face many of the challenges of the past, including 
annexation threats and the rising costs of water and trash services. 
</P>
<P>
 Kapuscik's backers say he always has an eye on the future of the district, and 
is moves ahead of Oxnard and Port Hueneme when it comes to annexation attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But some critics have charged that he uses the district as a springboard for 
his liberal ideology, spending money fighting issues that have little to do 
with the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Kapuscik defends his record, pointing to the 1992 Ventura County grand jury 
report and a recent letter by the Ventura County Alliance of Taxpayers, both of 
which praised the district's management. He also cited his decision last year 
to voluntarily take a $6,000 pay cut, reducing his salary to $56,000. 
</P>
<P>
 And he argued that everything he has crusaded against had dealt directly with 
improving services and cutting costs, using the district's legal battle with 
the Bailard Landfill as an example. 
</P>
<P>
 "The local landfill saw its rates increase by 100% every year for the past 10 
years," Kapuscik said. "That gave us the red flag we needed, and guess what? We 
found a better way to skin the cat." 
</P>
<P>
 The district has been hauling residents' trash to the Chiquita Canyon Landfill 
in Los Angeles County since 1991. And the community's recycling program is the 
only such effort in the county to turn a profit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite the district's record, leaders in surrounding cities say the 
beaches would benefit from being included in their jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Councilman Michael A. Plisky asked his city's staff in 1992 to study 
annexing the beaches. The plan makes sense for the future of the region, Plisky 
said, but he charged that Flynn has opposed the idea because he wants to ensure 
that Kapuscik does not lose his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn admitted that his championing of the beaches is due in part to his 
friendship with Kapuscik, but stressed that the main reason is his belief that 
the district is better off independent. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's certainly a lot of truth to that," Flynn said, "but it's a community 
that works. It's probably democracy working at its best." 
</P>
<P>
 The tiny district is beginning to have problems providing utilities and 
removing trash at a competitive price, however, and some residents worry that 
annexation may become a more attractive option if the trend continues. 
</P>
<P>
 A June comparison of trash, water and sewer rates in 14 local governments, 
including Oxnard and Port Hueneme, found that the district was fairly 
competitive, billing residents an average of $53.05 a month, or 99 cents more 
than the average for all the agencies combined. 
</P>
<P>
 But the district recently raised its water rates by $4. The money, board 
members say, will be used to pay for a joint project with Port Hueneme and the 
Navy to supply cheaper, better water to the area -- a necessary sacrifice for 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The beaches are already ahead of nearby cities when it comes to preventing 
crime. In 1993, only 355 crimes were reported in the communities, 12% less than 
the average for 1988 through 1992, according to the Sheriff's Department. Of 
those, only one led to a felony arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 But many residents are worried that a massive $170-million development plan 
for the Channel Islands Harbor -- which would include a major aquarium, 
condominiums and two hotels -- would turn their placid community into a 
congested tourist trap. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a peninsula here," Bennett said. "Hundreds of thousands of people 
are going to come down here. Where are you going to put them?" 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn and other backers of the aquarium say that unless traffic can be 
diverted away from the beaches' notoriously narrow streets, the facility will 
not be built.  
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to destroy the ambience of the harbor in search for a buck, but 
it does need improvements," said Forrest, who added that he supports a marine 
facility as long as it is educational. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite the hubbub over the communities' problems, many residents say the 
pristine white sands of Silver Strand, Hollywood and Hollywood by-the-Sea beat 
just about anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Fordney and his wife moved to Hollywood Beach in 1970 after his Malibu 
home burned down in a wildfire. He paid $50,000 for his two-story oceanfront 
home. It is worth $1 million today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always tell people who don't like it here to drive into Downtown Los 
Angeles, call me when they get home and then tell me there's something wrong 
with Hollywood Beach," said the former radio broadcaster, now 75. "It's a real 
panacea."

ELECTIONS / THOUSAND OAKS CITY COUNCIL; VOTERS WAGE WAR OF WORDS IN CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The three-page letter, impassioned and bitter, denounced a rival political 
bloc as "mean-spirited, manipulative and vicious." It claimed that voters had 
been "hoodwinked, lied to and mentally abused." 
</P>
<P>
 Standard political fare, perhaps, in these days of negative campaigns. Yet 
this letter had a twist: Its wrath was directed not at a candidate, but at a 
community advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
 The race for three open seats on the Thousand Oaks City Council has turned so 
fierce that voters have taken to attacking other voters. That is, when they're 
not attacking the candidates themselves in smear sheets or blistering letters 
to the editor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the most incredibly nasty race I've ever seen in the 20 years I've been 
here -- without a doubt," said Stephen Rubenstein, president of the Conejo 
Valley Chamber of Commerce. "There are zealots on both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the 16 candidates have taken brazen swipes at one another in 
television commercials, newspaper ads and public forums. But the most 
aggressive mudslinging has come from voters, politicians past and present 
agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decry the fact that it's descended to this level," retired businessman and 
candidate Marshall Dixon said. Noting that both of the city's ideological camps 
have produced attack literature, Dixon added: "Nobody's hands are clean." 
</P>
<P>
 The public comment period during council meetings has degenerated into a 
vicious political free-for-all, with residents taking the podium to slam 
candidates they dislike. Voters have taken the initiative in print as well, 
circulating flyers that blast out-of-favor candidates in the most personal 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all part of politics -- but politics that Thousand Oaks residents have 
never before known. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm seeing it, I'm hearing it, but I just can't believe it's happening," said 
Diane Doria, a Newbury Park resident for 15 years. "The viciousness, the 
whining . . . the slate thing. I've never seen anything like this." 
</P>
<P>
 This race has become so inflamed, candidates and activists agree, because it 
offers voters a clear choice between competing ideologies. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one side, incumbent Judy Lazar promises continuity: She will stick to 
the policies that have built Thousand Oaks into an affluent, safe, envied 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side, incumbent Elois Zeanah pledges change: She will work to 
slow growth and break the political establishment that has dominated the city 
for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Each camp has attracted a cluster of like-minded candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Alex Fiore and Councilman Frank Schillo have endorsed Lazar, Dixon, 
firefighter Andy Fox, and police detective Michael Markey. Financial services 
manager Michael Friedman and public-access television producer Jeannette 
Scovill have said they share similar philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side, Zeanah and Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski have endorsed 
retired filmmaker M. Ali Issari and city operations manager David Hare. City 
activist Ekbal Quidwai has declared himself an ally on most issues as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Only half a dozen candidates have remained unaligned: dentist Greg Cole, 
engineer Lee Laxdal, real estate salesman Chuck Morsa, planning Commissioner 
Irv Wasserman, mortgage broker Bill Williams and mobile carwash owner Lance 
Winslow. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The emergence of slates, for the first time ever, has sparked a rivalry of 
unprecedented intensity, longtime Thousand Oaks residents said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said two months ago that this would be war, and it is -- it's the war for 
Thousand Oaks," resident Michelle Koetke said. "It's like Gettysburg -- brother 
against brother. There's a lot of retribution out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Anonymous vandals have taken the time-honored -- though illegal -- tradition 
of tampering with candidates' signs to new extremes. Lazar has lost nearly 
every sign she set up in Newbury Park. Hare estimated that 80% of his 400 signs 
have been torn down. And other candidates report that their placards have been 
mutilated with chain saws. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a gory sight," Quidwai said of one Newbury Park street corner, where a 
dozen campaign signs were slashed and broken. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Cmdr. Kathy Kemp said she has received several formal complaints 
from candidates about sign vandalism. A newcomer to Thousand Oaks, Kemp said 
she cannot believe the high emotions surrounding this year's election. She saw 
one sign that "literally, someone had cut in slices," Kemp said. "It's 
ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 In perhaps the most startling incidents, Friedman reported receiving death 
threats and having his tires slashed outside his Wildwood home. Williams said 
he has also received a menacing call on his campaign hot line. 
</P>
<P>
 And an anonymous tip sheet circulating in town accuses one candidate of lying 
about his baptism and church membership. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredible that all this is going on in a race for City Council," 
Wasserman said. "I can understand if it's a presidential campaign, but a 
council race?" Sighing, he added: "Maybe I'm just naive." 
</P>
<P>
 While they deplore the negative atmosphere, most candidates predict that the 
slams will keep on coming -- and even intensify -- during the next week and a 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Zeanah has taken the most hits so far -- both from fellow candidates 
and from citizens who troop to the podium week after week to criticize her 
during council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 A pamphlet written by resident Jim Henson blasts Zeanah for being "emotional, 
not practical." Accusing her of using "innuendo and hostility" to achieve her 
goals, Henson summarized Zeanah's tactics as "fear, uncertainty and doubt. . . 
.The FUD Factor." 
</P>
<P>
 Another anti-Zeanah flyer suggests that if Zeanah is elected, "Thousand Oaks 
businesses will become part of the Endangered Species Act." Her foes have also 
distributed buttons with a red line slashing through a double Z -- targeting 
both Zeanah and Zukowski. 
</P>
<P>
 To counter such attacks, which she calls "character assassination," Zeanah 
plans to lash back at her enemies with some pointed remarks of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Special interests have targeted me with a smear campaign because they're 
scared they'll lose the council majority," she says in a 30-second television 
commercial. "They're fighting for power and profits. We're fighting for 
families, neighborhoods and the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah has also stepped up her jabs at Lazar, who is running for a second 
term. Poking fun at Lazar's slogan -- "The Voice of Reason" -- Zeanah has 
berated her colleague for compromising too often, for "playing let's make a 
deal every Tuesday night." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah's allies, especially the group Residents to Preserve Newbury Park, have 
circulated flyers blasting her political opponents as special-interest toadies. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Zeanah, Hare and Issari "are independent of the old power structure," one 
unsigned pamphlet asserts. "Everyone else, even those who claim environmental 
dedication, have shown by their votes and alliances to be part of the machine 
which intends to crush us once and for all," the flyer continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Such vindictiveness saddens many candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are not talking about their dreams when they get into mudslinging," 
said Laxdal, who served on the council from 1980-89 before resigning to take a 
temporary job in Australia. "This is probably the worst campaign we've had. It 
degrades the whole community." 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to inject a more positive note into the race, several candidates have 
tried to link themselves with gentler images. 
</P>
<P>
 Television commercials for Cole, Dixon, Fox, Friedman and Issari will include 
photos of children or grandchildren. And Zeanah's ads feature an animated wand, 
much like Tinkerbell's, touching off a cascade of Disney-like fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to persuade voters that he will not always vote like Fiore, despite the 
mayor's endorsement, Fox shot a television ad that could have come from 
Zeanah's pro-environment playbook. "I will not allow development to control our 
community," he says, while the camera focuses on him digging a hiking trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox also tries to snag voters' attention at dinner time, by plastering his 
flyers to Domino Pizza boxes. In the same vein, Markey passes out packs of M & 
M candy, to remind voters of his initials. 
</P>
<P>
 Hare has been distributing refrigerator magnets shaped like rabbits, to evoke 
his last name. And Friedman will hand trick or treaters Halloween stickers with 
his name on top of cavorting ghosts and goblins. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, meanwhile, has aimed to attract a literary crowd with his new 
slogan: "Ask not for whom the Bill toils -- he toils for thee." Taking a 
different tack, Winslow has dotted the city with hand-painted signs bearing 
slogans like, "Lance is the best-looking candidate," "Made U Look Can I Make U 
Vote" and, of course, "Lance has the best signs!" 
</P>
<P>
 For all their hard campaigning, however, no candidate is willing to predict 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't call this election, I'll tell you that," Zeanah said. "A single 
vote could make a difference. If people are at all interested, they better get 
out to the polls."

GROUNDS FOR CONCERN; NATIVE AMERICANS: OFFICIALS SAY THE SYSTEM FOR PROTECTING 
ANCIENT CHUMASH BURIAL SITES IS EASILY ABUSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regulations several Ventura County cities established to protect ancient 
Chumash burial grounds need to be overhauled because they invite abuse and have 
spawned anger and division among Native Americans, state and local officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems stem from fierce competition within the Chumash community for 
jobs as construction site monitors -- observers that Ventura County and most 
local cities require when projects are in culturally sensitive areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Monitors, who usually need only to say they are Chumash to be eligible for 
hiring, often lack the qualifications to review archeological finds, state 
officials said. That lack of knowledge has made it easy for archeologists and 
developers to manipulate findings in some cities, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've definitely got a problem," said Larry Myers, executive secretary of the 
California Native American Heritage Commission. "There is concern that 
developers are hiring people who don't know anything and are paying to get 
answers they want." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Myers and others said that most Ventura County cities, in 
adopting their monitoring policies, ignored the fact that more than a dozen 
Native American clans fall under the umbrella term Chumash. 
</P>
<P>
 The policies have left the groups competing for the lucrative contracts, 
leading to angry clashes between different Chumash clans. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month two groups disagreed so strongly about the fate of bones found on a 
public park site in Thousand Oaks that discussions deteriorated into 
name-calling and charges of impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, a Ventura clan, called the Chumash Native Nation of California, 
wrote letters to city, county and state officials demanding that it be the 
exclusive provider of project monitors. The cities of Thousand Oaks and Ventura 
received such letters. 
</P>
<P>
 And over the summer, city officials in Malibu began revamping their cultural 
heritage ordinance after an Agoura Hills businessman alleged that he had 
received late-night threats by the leader of the same group. 
</P>
<P>
 Malibu's policy was rigged so that one group would receive all contracts, the 
businessman said. City officials said they are changing their ordinance to 
encourage other Chumash monitors to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar problems have flared around Ventura County, prompting both Chumash 
leaders and government officials to re-evaluate procedures established to 
protect artifacts and ancient burial grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the late 1970s, when state officials first realized that valuable 
archeological sites were being bulldozed, cities have been required to protect 
"important archeological resources." Ventura, Simi Valley, Camarillo, Moorpark 
and Thousand Oaks were among the cities that responded by forcing developers to 
hire Chumash monitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal was to have Native Americans present when artifacts or bones were 
unearthed so they could tell archeologists how best to preserve sacred sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Chumash remains are found all along California's central coast, where an 
estimated 15,000 once lived in scattered villages. Anthropologists estimate 
that only about 3,000 people of Chumash descent remain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 State officials who introduced monitoring had noble intentions, local Chumash 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always wanted this," said Richard Angulo, a Chumash monitor based in 
Thousand Oaks. "We were tired of seeing people come in here and trample sacred 
land. These are our ancestors and we want to look after them." 
</P>
<P>
 But from the start, cities have had trouble finding well-trained monitors and 
creating a system that dealt consistently with artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, city planner Greg Smith said there have been numerous 
occasions over the last decade when monitors did not show up for site 
investigations or would sit in a car all day and collect a paycheck at sundown. 
</P>
<P>
 Angulo recalled another instance when a monitor halted a housing project for 
days when she found an item later revealed to be a clay flowerpot. 
</P>
<P>
 Even well-trained monitors do not always agree on the best way to handle 
artifacts once they are found. 
</P>
<P>
 John Johnson, a Chumash expert at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, 
said that on one occasion archeologists found a painting of a shark on a human 
bone. Scientists and Chumash leaders in Santa Ynez asked that the rare find be 
preserved, but the monitor on site decided it should be reburied. 
</P>
<P>
 "There seems to be no right or wrong answer as to how artifacts should be 
handled," Johnson said. "It just depends on who the monitor is." 
</P>
<P>
 Developers say they look at the process as a potentially costly and 
frightening risk because it empowers people who are not well-trained to stop a 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you hear that there is going to be an investigation of your land, it's 
one of those things where you just have to hope for the best," said Gary 
Austin, a developer of a giant project in Moorpark. "It's totally out of your 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Skene, the Agoura Hills businessman, confronted Malibu about its policies 
after his plan to build a home on five acres was stalled when he refused to use 
a specific monitor. He said placing such power in the hands of a monitor or 
archeologist is a mistake, especially because those decisions could cost 
builders hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The monitors charge about $30 an hour, and archeology costs can exceed $50,000 
even on a small project, Skene said. The more they find, the more days they 
work and the more they charge, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife is part Indian, and I have respect for these people. But at the same 
time I don't want to get screwed," Skene said. "These people are hunting around 
my land trying to find ways to charge me more and more money. It's crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, where monitors have been used since 1981, planner Smith said 
the city no longer accepts observers whose only qualification is a claim to be 
Chumash. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was just not enough," Smith said. "We need to know what their background 
is, what professional experience they have and what their availability is." 
</P>
<P>
 But other local governments are not as stringent. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo, Ventura and Simi Valley are among those where officials said they 
rely on a list provided by the state Heritage Commission to find monitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura senior planner Karen Bates said her city approves any monitor whose 
name appears on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone on that list is qualified, as far as were concerned," Bates said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Heritage Commission secretary Myers said that list was never intended to 
be used as a source for monitors. Anyone claiming to be Chumash can be placed 
on the list, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We provide that list to cities and developers so they can contact Indians in 
their area," Myers said. "We have done nothing in the way of reviewing these 
people to determine if they are qualified to monitor a site." 
</P>
<P>
 One Chumash group from Ventura tried last month to prevent the Heritage 
Commission from providing the list to cities. But builders and other Chumash 
responded by accusing the group -- led by Ventura resident Kote Lotah -- of 
trying to corner the market by using strong-arm tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 Skene, for example, reported that Lotah threatened to plant artifacts on his 
five-acre property in the middle of the night if Skene refused to hire Owl Clan 
Consultants, a business run by members of the Chumash Native Nation of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Varela, curator of the Chumash Interpretive Center in Thousand Oaks, said 
Lotah's efforts in Malibu reflect how aggressively he has pursued jobs 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Lotah, whose 19 monitors are frequently hired by local cities, acknowledged 
that he can play rough. But he denied threatening Skene. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are intimidating. But if you're going to have monitoring from 
inexperienced people, we're going to confront you," Lotah said. "We feel very 
strong about preserving these sacred sites." 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent use of inexperienced monitors, county planner Milada Allen said 
that her office is looking into more stringent competency standards. 
</P>
<P>
 And, while most Chumash agree that stronger standards are needed, members of 
several smaller groups said care must be taken so they are not written out of 
the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel like there is an effort to have monitoring locked up to a choice 
few," said Beverly Folkes, a director of the Oakbrook Park Chumash Indian Corp. 
in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be involved in monitoring, and I want to pass that down to my son," 
she said. "But people like me can't because we're considered too small and so 
we're being excluded," Folkes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Chumash say groups such as Oakbrook and Owl Clan and Angulo's California 
Indian Council must agree on competency standards for monitors -- and a fair 
distribution of monitoring jobs -- if the system is to be trusted. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding peace among the diverse groups will be a difficult task, Angulo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would love to see us join together to solve this, but that's going to mean 
a lot of effort on everyone's part to put ego aside," he said. "I don't know if 
we can do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason compromise is so difficult, Johnson explained, is that the 
Chumash people are not like other tribes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about people who came from numerous villages along the coast, 
many of whom spoke different languages," Johnson said. "The law asks cities and 
developers to turn to a unified Chumash voice for answers about how to treat 
artifacts and burial sites, which is something that by their very nature, 
(Chumash) cannot do." 
</P>
<P>
 Myers said he saw little hope of a system that ensures consistency and 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Heritage Commission just doesn't have the funds or the capability to 
ensure that the monitors are adequate," Myers said. "Perhaps there should be a 
system, but I don't see it happening in the foreseeable future."

VALLEY BRIEFING: PUMPKIN LORE / EXAMINING FALL'S MOST FAMOUS FRUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For many people, pumpkins represent little more than Halloween decorations and 
Thanksgiving desserts. For others, they represent a bountiful source of 
culinary inspiration, the key ingredient in everything from bread to soup. 
Still others use them to showcase boggling gardening feats, harvesting 
specimens of enormous dimension. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, the pumpkin is one of the most visible signs of fall's arrival. 
Images of the round, orange fruit are as much a symbol of the season as the 
changing color of autumn leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 The pumpkin patch. The jack-o'-lantern. The pumpkin pie.

</P>
<P>
 Although sometimes described as squash because of their botanical 
classification, pumpkins are actually part of the gourd family Cucurbitaceae . 
The common pumpkin is Cucurbita pepo . It grows on vines and bushes, and is 
rich in beta-carotene, vitamins A and C, potassium and iron. 
</P>
<P>
 Size: Most weigh between 15 and 30 pounds, although they can grow to hundreds 
of pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Coloring: The common pumpkin is orange. Other species are white and yellow. 
</P>
<P>
 Crop: California is the No. 2 pumpkin-producing state in the nation, with more 
than 4,000 acres devoted to the fruit. Illinois is No. 1 with more than 6,000 
acres. 
</P>
<P>
 History: They are believed to have originated in the tropical regions of North 
America, where several varieties of gourds, squash and pumpkins were raised by 
Native Americans. Seeds from related plants as much as 9,000 years old have 
been found in Mexico's highlands. Pumpkin Products 
</P>
<P>
 While many people buy pumpkins each year for Halloween decorations, which are 
discarded the next morning, there are hundreds of recipes available to turn the 
fruit into such edibles as breads, pancakes and soups. "If you use different 
kinds of seasonings, you can do all kinds of things," says Terry Pimsleur, 
president of the International Pumpkin Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the most popular form is the pumpkin pie -- a staple of millions of 
Thanksgiving meals in the United States. According to the IPA: 
</P>
<P>
 * About 88 million pumpkin pies are served each Thanksgiving in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 * Each year, 145,000 tons of pumpkin are processed for canning in the United 
States. 
</P>

 What calls back the past, like the rich pumpkin pie?

 -- John Greenleaf Whittier, "The Pumpkin" (1844) The Jack-o'-Lantern 
</P>
<P>
 Centuries ago in England and Ireland, candles were placed inside hollowed-out 
beets, potatoes and turnips. These were used as lanterns on All Hallows Eve, 
the annual night on which elves, fairies and witches were believed to roam the 
land. When the festival's customs were brought to America, pumpkins became the 
vessel of choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, jack-o'-lanterns are typically carved with elaborate facial designs and 
placed outside homes as candle-lit decorations on Halloween. The term 
jack-o'-lantern was originally given to the ghostly light, also known as 
will-o'-the-wisp, caused by the combustion of methane gas over swamps and 
marshes at night. Plump Pumpkins

<P>
 A decade ago, the world's largest pumpkin topped the scales at 500 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 That was then; this is now. 
</P>
<P>
 At its annual World Pumpkin Weigh-Off in San Francisco earlier this month, the 
IPA awarded its top prize to Nathan and Paula Zehr of Lowville, N. Y., for 
their 799-pound entry. The couple won $3,000 and a trip to next year's Japan 
Pumpkin Festival. Other winners in the world competition included: 
</P>
<P>
 * 774 pounds; John Perkins, Wiltshire, England 
</P>
<P>
 * 696 pounds; Joel Holland, Puyallup, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 The current Guinness record for the world's largest pumpkin belongs to a 
827-pound giant grown by Holland in 1992. Canadian Herman Bax produced a 
reportedly 990-pound pumpkin earlier this year, but it has yet to be verified 
by the Guinness staff. City of Pumpkins 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, some believe that the city of Calabasas was named for the Spanish 
word for pumpkins or gourds, calabazas , acknowledging the importance of the 
gourd in the culture of Native Americans who populated the area before the 
arrival of Spanish explorers in the late 18th Century. (But others say the city 
name was derived from that of a Chumash village.) 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, the city held its third annual pumpkin festival, drawing an 
estimated 20,000 visitors. This year's event featured a pumpkin weigh-off, 
pumpkin bowling and a pumpkin cook-off. But despite the hoopla, Calabasas 
admits that no pumpkins are grown in the city.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OXNARD; FIGHT AGAINST PROP. 187 TAKEN DOOR-TO-DOOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 One day after hundreds of Oxnard students rallied in an emotional protest, a 
handful of activists quietly moved through neighborhoods trying to secure votes 
against Proposition 187, the ballot measure that would deny most government 
services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very emotional, the whole march, the whole walkout," Oxnard College 
student Maria Jasso said Saturday. "But at the same time, there's work that has 
to be done with less people. It's kind of lonely." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, she joined about 1,200 screaming high school students who walked out 
of school to march and rally against the proposition. Saturday, as she knocked 
on doors in Oxnard's La Colonia neighborhood, she had just one other student 
along for company. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants in Friday's march had distributed flyers advertising Saturday 
morning's meeting to begin the anti-Proposition 187 get-out-the-vote campaign 
in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting attracted about 35 volunteers who met at Oxnard's All Saints 
Episcopal Church for training before splitting into teams and going out to walk 
the precincts. 
</P>
<P>
 The door-to-door campaign targeted occasional voters and asked them to request 
absentee ballots for the Nov. 8 election, said Karl Lawson, a member of the 
Ventura County Immigrant Rights Coalition, who organized the meeting. The 
absentee ballots would make it more convenient for them to vote, Lawson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the canvassers carried information on Proposition 187 and about how to 
become a U.S. citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers at the meeting said they were encouraged by the student marches and 
by recent polls that show Proposition 187 losing ground. "Thanks to the actions 
of students and community activists, we've arrived at the realization that it's 
possible to beat 187," Lawson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the volunteers said the election's outcome was by no means guaranteed. 
"The marches were great and fun, but there's a lot of work left to do," said 
Mario Brito, a United Farm Workers organizer who spoke at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the ballot initiative said they believe the walkouts will 
backfire and persuade more people to vote for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 'No' folks are doing us a great deal of service and we appreciate it," 
said Steve Frank, coordinator for the Ventura County campaign for Proposition 
187. "It reminds people that there are lawbreakers involved with illegal 
immigration." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's political meeting drew the attention of the Oxnard Police 
Department, which sent a representative to observe the training session and 
stationed police cars at intersections surrounding the church. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said get-out-the-vote efforts took place Saturday in Fillmore and 
Santa Paula. IRA E. STOLL

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OXNARD; CONFERENCE ADDRESSES WOMEN'S CONCERNS 
</P>

<P>
 When Sheila Cluff gained 50 pounds in college, she turned to exercise as a 
weight-loss plan. When her son died years later, she turned to exercise as a 
tranquilizer for her grief. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Cluff urged women at a daylong conference in Oxnard to use 
exercise as a tool to take control of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I intend to have you walk out of here today saying I can do that," Cluff said 
to a crowded auditorium. "Minor lifestyle changes can make a great change in 
your life." 
</P>
<P>
 Cluff, the creator and owner of two spas -- The Oaks in Ojai and The Palms in 
Palm Springs -- was the wrap-up speaker for the eighth annual Women Celebration 
Conference at Oxnard College. 
</P>
<P>
 About 250 women attended the conference, which featured a fashion show and 24 
workshops with topics ranging from parenting practices and self-esteem to 
makeup and finances. 
</P>
<P>
 While some women heard gynecologist Allen Lawrence speaking on the subject of 
women's reproductive organs, others listened to Damira Volic, a Bosnian refugee 
who fled army tanks and snipers to make Ventura her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bosnia is like another planet," said Volic during a workshop titled "Starting 
From Zero Again." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I think about what happened in my life in Bosnia, I feel like an old oak 
tree that was removed from its place and put somewhere where it wasn't suppose 
to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpinteria resident Marilyn Breland said she was glad she had driven to 
Oxnard to attend the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned some things that I can use in my personal life," Breland said. 
"It has been an uplifting event." CHRISTINA LIMA

WOMAN FOUND DEAD NEAR RINCON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County Sheriff's Department is investigating the possible homicide 
of a woman found dead on a desolate road near the Rincon on Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 The identity of the woman, who officials said is in her mid-20s, is being 
withheld pending notification of her next of kin. 
</P>
<P>
 The body was discovered by a passing motorist near Mussel Shoals at the end of 
a dead-end road, which runs parallel to the Ventura Freeway, shortly before 6 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 As the body of the woman, who appeared to be white with reddish brown hair, 
lay face up in the dirt, homicide detectives searched the scene for evidence. 
She was wearing a T-shirt, blue jeans and sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not ruled out homicide, murder or even accidental death," said 
Sheriff's Lt. Larry Robertson. "There's even the possibility of a single 
gunshot wound." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman appeared to have suffered a severe blow to the head, Robertson said. 
Police had not determined how long the body had been there.

PLANS FOR TEMPORARY GYM SHELVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Unified School District has scrapped plans to build a 
temporary gymnasium at Simi Valley High School after state authorities said 
they would not approve the project, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district had hoped to construct a $600,000 temporary facility to replace 
the high school's gym that was condemned after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Department of State Architects recently informed district officials 
that it would not approve a temporary gym to handle the number of students and 
faculty the school anticipated -- about 1,500 people, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will not approve it because the occupancy is too high," said Lowell 
Shultze, a spokesman for the district. The temporary gym would have been used 
for school assemblies, basketball games and physical education classes, Shultze 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the district will focus on plans to repair the high school's damaged 
gym and multipurpose room, which have been closed since the January temblor. 
The structures sustained about $2 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got back damage reports for the gym and the multipurpose room, and our 
estimate is that they can be open by September, 1995," Shultze said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, school officials are trying to find alternative practice 
sites for Simi Valley High's athletic teams and physical education classes. The 
basketball team will probably use the gym at either Royal High School or Apollo 
Continuation School, Shultze said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is also looking into using facilities at Moorpark College and the 
Simi Valley Parks and Recreation District, Shultze said.

TWO OFFICER GROUPS ENDORSING O'CONNELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Representatives of two Ventura County law enforcement groups have announced 
their support of Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) in his bid for the 
state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from the county's Deputy Sheriffs Assn. and the Police 
Officers Assn. praised O'Connell for his tough stance on crime issues and his 
support of officers on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always there for us," said Harlan Rudd, director of the Deputy Sheriffs 
Assn. "And in today's political world, he's a stand-up guy. We need more people 
of his caliber." 
</P>
<P>
 Rudd noted that O'Connell, who has received the support of nearly every major 
local law enforcement group, has written or supported legislation that has 
toughened penalties for drug dealers, juveniles caught carrying guns and repeat 
sex offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The primary goal of government is to protect the citizenry," O'Connell said 
in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell is running against Republican Steve MacElvaine, a former San Luis 
Obispo County supervisor, for an open seat in the 18th Senate District, which 
covers Ventura, Santa Paula, Ojai and Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo 
counties.

BUSINESSMAN FACES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard real estate speculator Donald T. Kojima, who sold the city 41 acres of 
farmland for a school and low-income housing project, has been arrested on 
suspicion of striking a Ventura woman and knocking her down, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kojima was arrested at 2 p.m. Thursday at the Ventura police station after 
turning himself in to Detective Lynn Klamser.He was released from County Jail 
on Friday morning on a promise that he would appear in court to face a domestic 
violence charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Police Lt. Mike Tracy said the arrest stemmed from an Oct. 18 incident 
in which Kojima allegedly struck a 40-year-old woman in the face, knocking her 
to the floor of her east Ventura home. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who described Kojima as her boyfriend, said he hit her after 
entering her house at 1:55 a.m., Tracy said. The woman called police a few 
minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 Kojima could not be reached for comment. He is scheduled to appear in court 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council bought the 41 acres from Kojima for $5.32 million in 
August. The land will be used for houses, a school and a park.

COUNTY HEALTH OFFICIALS ORDER WORM CONCERN TO CLOSE FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid a search for new quarters, The Worm Concern has been ordered by Ventura 
County health officials to shut down its composting facility near Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's Environmental Health Division has slapped the business with an 
order requiring it to stop accepting the 100 tons per day of green waste that 
it feeds to worms. The worms convert the grass clippings, tree trimmings and 
other yard waste -- collected by Simi Valley area trash haulers -- into compost 
that the company resells for fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
 The county order also demands that the company stop all composting activities 
and remove the compost from its site on Tierra Rejada Road by Dec. 31. The 
company faces fines of up to $10,000 per day if it fails to comply, the order 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Worm Concern has been looking for new quarters for several weeks, 
president Richard Morhar said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Originally, the county said they'd back off if we were going to move, but in 
the meantime, they've leaned on us even heavier," Morhar said Friday. "It's 
just tough to be a business in today's world. You try to do something good and 
right, and now this." 
</P>
<P>
 The company's neighbors have hired an attorney and a political consultant in a 
bid to force The Worm Concern out of the Tierra Rejada Valley, after they 
complained that smells from the compost caused them breathing problems, nausea 
and other ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Frank, the consultant, has begun circulating a questionnaire asking 
neighbors of The Worm Concern whether odors from the site are causing them 
health problems, or even lost time from work.  
</P>
<P>
 Frank said that he gave the questionnaire to 25 households within half a mile 
of The Worm Concern, and plans this week to give it to 60 more neighbors. The 
results will be turned over to the state and county health departments, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Worm Concern recently hired its own attorney to fight the cease-and-desist 
order so it will have ample time to move, Morhar said.

HARASSING CALLS CREATE TENSION; LAWNDALE: MAYOR PRO TEM ACCUSES COUNCILMAN OF 
PHONING HIS HOME AND HANGING UP. LARRY RUDOLPH DENIES HIS HOUSEHOLD WAS SOURCE 
OF ANNOYANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying he is the victim of "small-time political vandalism," Lawndale Mayor 
Pro Tem Norm Lagerquist has accused Councilman Larry Rudolph of making 
harassing phone calls to his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudolph denies making the calls and says the accusations were made as 
political retribution. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one from my house made those calls," Rudolph said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lagerquist says telephone records prove his allegations, but that assertion 
has also caused controversy.  
</P>
<P>
 In a statement to the council Monday night, Lagerquist said he had received 
eight phone calls between 1 and 3 a.m. beginning Sept. 27. The most recent call 
was Oct. 23. Each time, the caller hung up when the phone was answered, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like these calls to stop. My peace of mind is being harmed," 
Lagerquist said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the fourth call, Lagerquist said, he asked Pacific Bell's "annoyance 
calls" bureau to trace his incoming calls. Lagerquist said a Pacific Bell 
customer service representative told him that three early-morning calls placed 
Oct. 3 to 6 were traced to Rudolph's residence. Lagerquist said he did not get 
the operator's name. But sheriff's detectives confirmed the information, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell officials would not comment on Lagerquist's request for tracing, 
but they said his telephone records, including the incoming calls, have been 
turned over to the Lennox sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lagerquist said he got his information from a Pacific Bell 
representative, company officials say it is against their policy to tell a 
customer any information about a company investigation, including the name, 
address or phone number of a caller. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be surprised if a customer service representative volunteered the 
information. . . . We send that information directly to the (sheriff)," Pacific 
Bell spokeswoman Linda Bonniksen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's detectives say that Lagerquist filed a complaint about the calls 
Oct. 11 and that they are investigating the matter. Sgt. Jim LeBlanc said no 
one in the Sheriff's Department released information about the caller to 
Lagerquist and did not confirm any information for him. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations are the latest in a series of political barbs traded by 
Rudolph and Lagerquist, who have been political adversaries since Lagerquist 
joined the council in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Lagerquist said the harassing phone calls began the night that he supported 
ousting Rudolph's wife from the Parks and Recreation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Sept. 26 City Council meeting, Lagerquist, along with council members 
Nancy Marthens and Virginia M. Rhodes, voted against Shirley Rudolph and 
selected a new member to fill her commission seat. Mayor Harold E. Hofmann and 
Larry Rudolph supported Rudolph's wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Marthens and Rhodes say they also received annoying calls late in the night, 
but neither reported the incidents to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudolph said he was not upset by the council's decision to replace his wife. 
He also said that Lagerquist, in making the harassment charge, is trying to get 
even with him for a past dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudolph voted to censure him after Lagerquist wrote a letter on city 
stationery asking a judge for leniency for an associate who pleaded no contest 
in a lewd conduct case involving a 12-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's still sore from when he got his hand caught in the cookie jar 
supporting a child molester, and he's been after me ever since," Rudolph said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lagerquist said he does not hold a grudge. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials say the investigation should be complete by Tuesday.

STAN THE MUSIC MAN; BASEBALL: THIRTY YEARS AFTER HE RETIRED, THE ST. LOUIS 
CARDINALS' HALL OF FAMER HAS FOUND A SECOND CAREER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By R.B. FALLSTROM, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stan Musial is still piling up the hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years after he retired from baseball, the St. Louis Cardinals' Hall of 
Famer has found a second career. He's now Stan the Music Man, and he wields a 
pretty mean harmonica. 
</P>
<P>
 Mean enough to merit a how-to book for beginners, an instructional cassette 
and a spot in a local trio known for its sessions of "Geriatric Jazz." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an amateur player," music publisher Mel Bay said. "One of the most 
difficult things was finding 58 songs without sharps or flats. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Stan doesn't have to be great. His personality and his fame makes it 
great. He can play a half-dozen songs and still make a hit record." 
</P>
<P>
 Musial's main business these days is autographs. After signing for free for 
decades, his company, Stan the Man Ltd., has added a price tag for the serious 
collector. A few days each week Musial, 73, shows up at a small office near his 
home for an hour or so. 
</P>
<P>
 "The memorabilia business has gotten so big and these promoters are selling 
all this stuff," Musial said. "So I thought I'd join them. It's all pretty 
commercial, but that's the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Musial said he can sign about 300 items per hour, which can be pretty 
lucrative at $100 per bat, $50 for lithographs and $20 to $25 for balls. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that the .331 career hitter can't really use any of that stuff, his 
new first love seems to be music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing the harmonica is almost as much fun as playing baseball," Musial says 
in his song book. 
</P>
<P>
 Not as frustrating, either, considering the current state of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's catastrophic, really, what's happened," Musial said of the strike and 
canceled season. "Everybody loves this game. Probably, we were underpaid in our 
days somewhat. Probably these players are overpaid." 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball makes Musial, a senior vice president with the Cardinals, shake his 
head ruefully. Music makes him tap his feet to the beat. And he doesn't appear 
to care whether he makes a dime off it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun," Musial said. "It really is fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Musial always has been musically inclined. In the 1940s, he was part of an 
informal jug band that celebrated the Cardinals' victories. Musial played coat 
hangers, while others manned the washtub and medicine ball. But no harmonica. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny, when I was with the Cardinals I never played it much," Musial 
said. "I didn't know too many songs at that time." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he knows at least 58. Among the chestnuts offered in his song book are 
"Bury Me Not on the Lone Prairies," "Camptown Races," "On Top of Old Smokey" 
and "Meet Me in St. Louis, Louis." 
</P>
<P>
 With a little work, anyone can do it, Musial said. Just purse your lips and 
blow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned as a kid," he said. "It's not hard to play. Like anything else, 
you've got to practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Musial has entertained at dinners for years with his crowd-pleasing version of 
"Wabash Cannonball" and a few others. He's also played with the likes of Al 
Hirt and country-western artists Charlie Pride and Roy Clark. Musial and St. 
Louis Symphony pops conductor Richard Hayman performed a harmonica duet of the 
National Anthem for the Cardinals' opener last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice they let an amateur like me join them," Musial said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it all had been dabbling before he met Bay, 81, about a year ago at Bay's 
music store in a St. Louis suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't long before Bay, a big baseball fan, suggested Musial put his 
talents to use. Musial and Bay, who's famed for his best-selling guitar method 
books, formed the "Geriatric Jazz" trio along with banjo player John Becker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're getting so many requests to play, we need an agent," Musial said. 
"Our group could be a lot of places playing."

 At least one time the group wasn't discriminating enough when it picked a 
nursing home for a concert. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the time I like to play with my eyes closed, so I can concentrate and 
hit the right notes," Musial said. "Anyway, there must have been around 100 
people around at this nursing home. I'm half way through my song, and I open my 
eyes and half of the people are sleeping." 
</P>
<P>
 Musial didn't take it personally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just played loud and woke them up," he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 The song book has pictures of Musial showing how to hold the harmonica, as 
well as a page on Musial's career baseball record and photos of him on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 Uh oh, reminders of the game again. Bay's a little worried the baseball strike 
will affect sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just hoping that baseball strike will not leave a feeling of antipathy 
among the fans," Bay said. "We have all these millionaires out there holding up 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Musial promises to help them forget. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's sure crazy about that harmonica," Bay said.

FLUTIE FINDS MAGIC IN CFL; PRO FOOTBALL: THE 5-9 QUARTERBACK SAYS OF HIS STINT 
IN THE NFL THAT HE "WAS WINNING, BUT I WASN'T FLASHY ENOUGH FOR THEM, OR BIG 
ENOUGH." 
</P>

<P>
 Give him just one more last chance, pleads Doug Flutie. He is peeling tape off 
his ankles, sitting at his locker in his red football pants and sweaty gray 
T-shirt, muttering. "All I know is, there's still a second on that clock. At 
least a second." 
</P>
<P>
 It is 10 years since his so-called "Hail Mary" pass, that 48-yard lightning 
bolt that lifted Boston College past Miami on Thanksgiving weekend, 47-45, as 
time expired. That pass, one of football's most unlikely and memorable, 
conjured by one of the smallest men on the field for a national TV audience, 
virtually won Flutie the 1984 Heisman Trophy and, more than that, painted the 
official portrait of Flutie: Miracle worker. Patron of lost causes. 
Irrepressible little big man. 
</P>
<P>
 When Colorado's Kordell Stewart, a month ago, threw a 64-yard Flutie on the 
last play of the game to stun Michigan, "everybody compared it to mine," Flutie 
noticed. Which was both a compliment and, somehow, an affront: As if that were 
the only play Flutie ever made. As if, in spite of that play and all that goes 
before and after it, Flutie still must prove that he is big enough and fast 
enough to play this sport at the highest level. 
</P>
<P>
 And he sits in a Canadian Football League locker room last week, summarily 
peeved over the unjust loss of one second. At least one second. 
</P>
<P>
 His first-place CFL team, the Calgary Stampeders, had just lost to the 
Hamilton Tiger-Cats, 27-24. With 48 seconds to play, Flutie, his equilibrium 
still imperfect after an earlier blow to the head, started the game's final 
drive from his own 35-yard line and winged Calgary quickly down the field, to 
the Hamilton 35, by throwing four passes -- one dropped, three completed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the CFL, with its 110-yard field, that's 40 yards, covered almost 
instantly. In the CFL, with the goal posts situated on the goal line, that put 
Calgary in position for the tying field goal, and overtime. But, as Calgary 
receiver Pee Wee Smith scrambled off the turf after the 29-yard gain, the game 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at Pee Wee and then I looked at the clock and I saw it change from 2 
to 1 to zero," Flutie insisted. "That's B.S.; absolute B.S. That's aggravating. 
I mean, the whistles are in those guys' mouths. All they have to do is blow 
them when he hits the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 In high school, Flutie's Natick, Mass., team was losing to Braintree with 30 
seconds to play when Flutie marched his team into field-goal range and, though 
he never had attempted a field goal before, he kicked the winning 36-yarder. 
Natick was losing to Needham in the final minute when Flutie scrambled for a 
first down on fourth-and-20 to keep the game-winning drive alive. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a fourth-string freshman quarterback at Boston College when he was 
called off the bench in the fourth quarter against Penn State and threw for 135 
yards and a touchdown. "It was like somebody flicked on a switch," said Jack 
Bicknell, his coach at the time. During his senior season at B.C., Flutie twice 
threw touchdown passes on fourth down to beat Alabama, threw six TD passes 
against North Carolina and, of course, beat Miami when he threw to roommate 
Gerard Phelan on the last play. 
</P>
<P>
 Over and over, for years and years, he has caused hardened old football people 
to shake their heads with a reverence that would set choirs to singing "Amazing 
Grace." Even his teammates said he was "magic." Yet, to Flutie, "I guess what's 
aggravating is that, because you've done it so many times, or you've got a 
reputation for doing it, people think of it, like, 'Flutie magic.' It's hard 
work. It's not magic. It's not mirrors." 
</P>
<P>
 Watch closely. Not drafted until the 11th round by the Los Angeles Rams, 
Flutie opted for Donald Trump's USFL New Jersey Generals in 1985 and didn't 
make it to the NFL until the Chicago Bears signed him midway through the 1986 
season. He still was considered too small -- listed as 5-9 at B.C. and 
sarcastically called "America's midget" by Bears veteran Jim McMahon -- but in 
his first NFL start, late in the '86 season, he quarterbacked an upset against 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 In early '88 he went to the New England Patriots as a third-stringer, came off 
the bench in his first game to spark a 14-point rally, including a last-ditch 
80-yard drive and a 13-yard bootleg run for the winning score. With the 
Patriots, a bad team, he proceeded to win seven of the 10 games he started, 
"but in the NFL, they just want big guys who just throw the ball," Flutie said. 
"They want to program everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Even this latest NFL gizmo -- planting speakers inside quarterback helmets so 
a coach can call every play -- tees off Flutie, who calls 50% of his own plays 
in Calgary and can make due with hand signals from the sideline the rest of the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was winning but I wasn't flashy enough for them, or big enough. In the NFL, 
it's, you know, 'Let's put in a guy who's 6-4. We'll lose but we'll look good 
losing.' It amazes me the guys who hang around, sitting on the bench in that 
league. There are guys in the NFL that I've never lost to. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I was getting shorter and shorter. I was measured at 5-10 in high school, 
and pretty soon I'm 5-7. And slower. One watch has me running a 4.33 (for 40 
yards) this year, another 4.41. I'm 32 years old, so I probably could run a 
little faster when I was younger. But the NFL has me at 4.87, and once it's on 
the books . . . Shoot, I never was timed my senior year at B.C. because I 
signed with the Generals. Some NFL scout came around my junior year, when I was 
playing an intramural basketball game, and timed me at halftime in basketball 
sneakers. But you ask Jerry Glanville about the time we played Houston and I 
was pulling away from his defensive backs. He said I was at least running 4.5." 
</P>
<P>
 So Flutie went to the CFL, signing with British Columbia where, in his debut 
in July 1990, he threw a 37-yard touchdown pass with one second left to send 
the game into overtime. In 1992, Calgary signed him for $1 million and gave him 
10% of the team on top of that. And, in the CFL's Western Division final that 
year, Flutie took the team 73 yards in the last 73 seconds to beat Edmonton, 
23-22. "Better than the John Elway drive" (in the AFC playoffs against 
Cleveland), CFL followers insist. 
</P>
<P>
 Flutie has been to Canada's Super Bowl, the Grey Cup game, twice in four 
seasons and won it once. He has won three consecutive CFL MVP awards and is the 
runaway favorite to win a fourth. He has passed for 4,800 yards already this 
year and more than 26,000 in just 4 1/2 seasons, and he just keeps pulling 
rabbits out of his hat. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just makes ungodly plays," said Hamilton Coach Don Sutherin, who was a 
defensive assistant on Flutie's Calgary team in 1992 and 1993. "I know in the 
'92 Grey Cup game, two blocks were missed in our offensive line on one play, 
and it didn't matter. Doug completed a 35-yarder, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy's a Houdini," said Dan Kepley, widely considered the greatest 
linebacker in CFL history and now a TV commentator. Kepley has seen plenty 
since he played in the league 20 years ago, but he's never seen Flutie-like 
escapes before. 
</P>
<P>
 Flutie is so valuable that the CFL has rewritten its rules to allow each team 
to sign one "marquee" player and not include his salary under the $2.5 million 
salary cap. As Calgary's marquee player, he has solidified the Stampeders as 
the league's glamour team, only three years after an S.O.S. -- Save Our Stamps 
-- campaign to keep from selling or moving the team. In a league with a minimum 
salary of $30,000, where Flutie's Calgary teammate Stu Laird has a day job as a 
fireman and Hamilton wide receiver Wally Zatylny runs a deli, Flutie is a 
multi-millionaire and the biggest draw. "The greatest player who's ever played 
the game," said Calgary owner Larry Ryckman. "Even Joe Montana, who's my idol, 
doesn't have the stats Doug has." 
</P>
<P>
 Every pat on Flutie's back somehow seems to come with a slap in the face. This 
is, after all, the CFL. And, though it has nurtured such star NFL quarterbacks 
as Warren Moon, Joe Theismann and Joe Kapp, with its wide-open, 
three-downs-instead-of-four urge to throw the ball, it remains "minor league" 
in perception -- not only on bar stools but in same-thinking football minds 
around the land. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember we went down to play Alabama my senior year at B.C., when Ray 
Perkins was coaching there," Flutie said. "And he said that I'd be a good CFL 
quarterback. I took it as an insult, or a backhanded compliment at best." 
Former New York Giants assistant Joe Galat, the head coach of the CFL's 
now-defunct Montreal Alouettes during Flutie's last year at B.C., was so 
convinced Flutie would be rejected by the NFL -- because of his size -- that 
"Galat went around talking about what Flutie would do for the Alouettes," said 
Chris Cuthbert, a CFL broadcaster. "Then Flutie threw the Hail Mary pass, and 
Galat was walking around like he'd seen a ghost. He knew the NFL would have to 
try to get Flutie then." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's so suited for the CFL," said Hamilton's Sutherin. "It's a shame he 
hadn't come up here when he was younger; he'd have broken every record in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 He is, Flutie says, "much prouder of things I've accomplished here right now" 
than for a single play a decade ago. "But I guess if that's what I'm going to 
be remembered for, it's rather that than not to be remembered at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the ending here, just last week, "won't be out of my system until 
we get back out on the field and win," Flutie said. "It will sit there. I can't 
just blow it off and go out and get drunk with the fellows and forget it. I 
don't drink, anyway, but it's more important to me than that." 
</P>
<P>
 He looks up from post-game undressing of his feet, to make eye contact. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my job."

COOK-TO-STOKES CONVERSION HELPS END BRUIN STREAK

 Skip Hicks scored on a seven-yard run with 3:05 remaining and Wayne Cook then 
threw a two-point conversion pass to J.J. Stokes, lifting UCLA to a 31-30 
victory over Stanford on Saturday at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Stenstrom, who passed for a career-high 408 yards, guided the Cardinal 
into position for a game-winning field goal, but Eric Abrams was wide left on a 
32-yard try with 16 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins (3-6, 1-5 in Pac-10) snapped a six-game losing streak, their 
longest since 1943 when they lost seven in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA moved 71 yards on 12 plays for the winning touchdown, and the 6-foot-5 
1/2 Stokes then caught the conversion pass in the right corner of the end zone 
over Leroy Pruitt, a 5-9 cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford (2-5-1, 1-4) moved from its 35-yard line to the Bruins 15 before the 
left-footed Abrams, who had kicked three field goals earlier in the game, 
missed by inches. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams combined for 1,008 yards of total offense.

OREGON (YES, OREGON) TIED FOR 1ST

<P>
 That's no typographical error at the top of the Pacific 10 standings. 
</P>
<P>
 After Saturday's 10-9 upset of 11th-ranked Arizona, Oregon is tied for the 
conference lead and, with three games to play, is a serious threat for its 
first Rose Bowl appearance in 37 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last week, quarterback Danny O'Neil had never brought the Ducks from 
behind in the second half. Now he has done it two weeks in a row against 
nationally ranked opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the fourth quarter, Oregon scored the game's only touchdown on 
O'Neil's 15-yard pass to tight end Josh Wilcox and went ahead for good. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks, with freshmen and sophomores filling several important roles, were 
picked to finish at or near the bottom of the conference standings. But they 
are 4-1 in the Pac-10 for the first time since 1970 and are tied for first with 
Arizona, USC and Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 "We obviously have made this race extremely interesting for everybody in the 
league and everybody in the state of Oregon," said Duck Coach Rich Brooks, who 
only six weeks ago was feeling the heat after a 1-2 start. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon (6-3 overall) has beaten USC, and with Arizona State, Stanford and 
Oregon State remaining on the schedule, the Ducks can finally think about the 
Rose Bowl without eliciting sarcastic laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all young and we're all a little nuts," Wilcox said. "I don't think we 
really know what it means, but it's cool." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was tough on a senior-dominated Arizona team that was favored to make 
its first Rose Bowl appearance. But quarterback Dan White said the Wildcats 
aren't out of it yet with games left against California, USC and Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned from last year. After losing to UCLA, we thought we were out of it 
but we still could have gone if we'd beaten Cal," he said. "We've just got to 
put this behind us and learn from it." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Oregon's 1957 Rose Bowl team were the honored guests at Autzen 
Stadium and watched as the Ducks' "Gang Green" defense was just as dominating 
as Arizona's touted "Desert Swarm." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats (6-2 overall) led 9-0 at halftime on three field goals by Steve 
McLaughlin but managed only two first downs in the second half against the 
Ducks, winners of four of their last five, including a 31-20 victory over 
Washington a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope people start talking about our defense," linebacker Rich Ruhl 
said. "We have a great defense, and I think we're sometimes overlooked by 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 The game's only touchdown capped a 12-play, 53-yard drive that began after 
Herman O'Berry's 16-yard punt return put the ball on the Oregon 47. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neil completed first-down passes on third and 11 and third and eight to keep 
the drive alive, but the biggest play came on fourth and five at the Arizona 27 
when O'Neil threw over the middle to Pat Johnson. The pass was incomplete, but 
the Wildcats' Mike Scurlock was called for pass interference, giving Oregon the 
ball at the 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on third and nine at the 15, O'Neil expected a blitz from the safety 
position and called a pass play designed to take advantage of Wilcox against a 
slower defender. O'Neil lofted the ball to the corner of the end zone, where 
Wilcox had outrun linebacker Thomas Demps. Matt Belden kicked the conversion 
that made it 10-9 with 12:17 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea that Oregon doesn't have talent is wrong," Arizona Coach Dick Tomey 
said. "They have darned good talent. They've come together and they have a 
tremendous belief in themselves right now, and that's a very powerful thing."

BRUINS' VICTORY IS LIKE MEDICINE IN PAINFUL SEASON; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: LOSING 
STREAK ENDS AT SIX WHEN STANFORD MISSES LATE FIELD-GOAL TRY, 31-30.

<P>
 So this is what it feels like? 
</P>
<P>
 So good that Wayne Cook's chin didn't hurt, even with the blood dripping. 
</P>
<P>
 So good that Paul Guidry didn't limp, even with an ice bag taped to his calf. 
</P>
<P>
 So good that Rod Smalley felt no pain, though there is little in his body that 
hasn't ached this season. 
</P>
<P>
 How good? 
</P>
<P>
 "As good as it felt last year after the SC game," Cook said. That was a 
victory that sent UCLA to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's 31-30 victory over Stanford, before 42,429 at the Rose Bowl, came 
when Eric Abrams missed a 32-yard field-goal attempt with 20 seconds to play. 
It sent all but one of the Bruins off the field smiling -- UCLA kicker Bjorn 
Merten was commiserating with his Cardinal counterpart -- for the first time 
since Sept. 10. It broke a six-game losing streak, one short of the school 
season record, and it spawned a feel-good response that made players call upon 
childhood memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like a little kid in a candy store," wide receiver J.J. Stokes said of 
catching a two-point conversion pass from Cook to win the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The points came after a seven-yard touchdown run by Skip Hicks with 3:05 to 
play, and before a last-ditch drive by Stanford to Abrams' miss. And the points 
came after a timeout discussion in which Stokes let it be known that he had 
been eavesdropping. 
</P>
<P>
 When UCLA lined up to try for the extra points, Stanford had two defenders on 
Stokes. "I heard the safety tell the linebacker, 'You know, you aren't supposed 
to be out here,' " Stokes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook called time out. 
</P>
<P>
 "J.J. said he believed they would be covering him one on one," Cook said of 
the next play. 
</P>
<P>
 They were. Cornerback Leroy Pruitt, all 5 feet 9 of him, had Stokes, who is 
6-5, alone on the right side. All that was left was for Cook to get the ball to 
him. He almost didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he threw the two-point pass, I didn't see it because of the lights," 
Stokes said. "I just grabbed for it and it fell into my arms." 
</P>
<P>
 Not affording Stokes extra coverage "was our blunder," Stanford Coach Bill 
Walsh said. "We should have doubled him again. We didn't handle that well, 
let's face it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinal didn't handle a lot of things well, including Stokes (five 
catches for 94 yards and a touchdown) and Kevin Jordan (eight for 146 and a 
score). 
</P>
<P>
 "Does the word star-crossed describe it?" Walsh said of the game. "Is that a 
word? Use that one." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford lost, even though Steve Stenstrom had his most productive game: 28 
for 45 for 408 yards and two touchdowns. In the first quarter, he hit Justin 
Armour on a 38-yard pass play to become only the 10th player in Division I-A 
history to pass for more than 10,000 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Armour caught 11 passes for 220 yards and a 17-yard touchdown, using his 6-6 
frame to get open seemingly at will against UCLA's 5-9 defensive backs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went with our base defense in the first half and couldn't get any pressure 
on the quarterback and gave up 24 points," defensive coordinator Bob Field 
said. "We decided to go with our '41' package in the second half (which puts 
six defensive backs on the field). We figured we'd get some speed and maybe 
make some things happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins (3-6, 1-5 in the Pacific 10) got an interception by Donnie Edwards 
and had two goal-line stands that made Stanford settle for field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're inside the five and you give up three points instead of a 
touchdown, you feel like it's a victory," Coach Terry Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing had felt like a victory in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was looking like the team that had the ball last would win it," UCLA 
linebacker Smalley said. "Fortunately, it didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Manning's diving catch of a 35-yard pass from Stenstrom gave Stanford a 
24-20 lead at halftime and prompted Field to go for broke in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Stanford (2-5-1, 1-4) that broke. 
</P>
<P>
 On first and goal at the UCLA two in the third quarter, Anthony Bookman got a 
yard, then tried to get the other on second down. He dived, but ran into 
Smalley on top of the pile. "I knew he was coming," Smalley said.  
</P>
<P>
 On third down, left guard Mike Jerich was pushed back, stepping on Stenstrom's 
foot, and the quarterback fell for a three-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Abrams' 21-yard field goal made it 27-20, but it felt like a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 So did a stand in the fourth quarter, when Stanford had driven from its 30 to 
UCLA's six, with first and goal as the quarter began. The Cardinal stalled, and 
Abrams' 22-yard field goal made it 30-20. 
</P>
<P>
 It was answered by Merten's field goal from 38 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive to the final touchdown included a 20-yard hookup from Cook to 
Jordan, and one of 16 yards to the Stanford 19. But most of the work was done 
by Hicks, who ran on six of the 12 plays, and for 34 of the 71 yards, including 
the final seven. 
</P>
<P>
 It gave Cook (19 of 25 for 296 yards) a chance to answer critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "You asked what it would take to show people that I could win a game in the 
closing moments," Cook said. "Well, there it is. I took a team to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he had to stand by while Stenstrom went back to work with 65 yards to 
cover, but 3:05 to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 On fourth and 17 from his 28, Stenstrom found Armour for 23 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a done deal at that point," Stenstrom said. "I didn't know 
if we would score a touchdown, but I assumed we would get a field goal." 
</P>
<P>
 He got the ball to the UCLA 15, where Abrams made his final effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw it when it was going by the upright, and it must have missed by a foot 
or less," he said. "I knew for about 3 1/2 minutes that it was going to come 
down to me . . . and I was looking forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Abrams also missed from 22 yards in the closing moments of a 41-41 tie with 
Northwestern in the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a good feeling," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Or a good sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he made it, but of course he didn't," Walsh said. "The noise didn't 
sound right. It should have been a quiet sound and it wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 To the Bruins, it sounded as good as it felt.

NEBRASKA'S DOMINATION HAS EVERYONE BUFFALOED; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: CORNHUSKERS' 
24-7 VICTORY OVER COLORADO MIGHT EVEN BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR NO. 1 RANKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Who's No. 1? Well, Nebraska can tell you who's not. 
</P>
<P>
 It definitely isn't Colorado, which left Memorial Stadium in a daze after the 
Cornhuskers' 24-7 victory Saturday put a sweat sock in the mouths of everyone 
who considered Nebraska a national championship afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did at will whatever they wanted to," Colorado defensive tackle Darius 
Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
 So thorough was the defeat that you could have given the Buffaloes a fifth . . 
. sixth . . . even seventh down, as well as a rosary full of Hail Marys, and it 
wouldn't have mattered. About the only miracle for Colorado was that nobody got 
hurt as jubilant Nebraska fans stormed the field and tore down the uprights and 
took an ABC mini-cam with them. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the third consecutive Cornhusker victory over the Buffaloes, and 
while it didn't quite match the so-called "Lincoln Assassination" in 1992, when 
Nebraska won, 52-7, it was close. In an afternoon's time, third-ranked Nebraska 
(9-0) ended second-ranked Colorado's undefeated season and the Heisman Trophy 
hopes of quarterback Kordell Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, the Cornhuskers positioned themselves for another Big Eight 
Conference title, another trip to the Orange Bowl and another shot at a 
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the Orange Bowl game," said Stewart, who completed only 13 of 30 
passes for 159 yards and no touchdowns. "We're not going and they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska still has to beat Kansas, Iowa State and Oklahoma, but nobody seemed 
too concerned about the prospects of a Cornhusker collapse -- not after the way 
Nebraska handled Colorado (7-1), which began the game with 11 consecutive 
victories, five against ranked opponents. Instead, there was postgame talk of 
the Cornhuskers challenging Penn State for the No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I don't much care about the polls," Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Junker does. The executive director of the Fiesta Bowl came to Lincoln to 
protect his interests, though he couldn't come out and say so. With Colorado 
supposedly on its way to an unbeaten season and Nebraska supposedly hampered by 
the loss of star quarterback Tommie Frazier to a blood clot, Junker figured the 
Cornhuskers would be in Tempe, Ariz., come bowl day. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Saturday's rout. Afterward, Junker stopped Osborne as the Cornhusker 
coach made his way out of the press box. You couldn't tell if Junker 
congratulated him or simply said goodby. Whatever it was, you can probably wave 
farewell to that Notre Dame-Nebraska matchup. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Cornhuskers do make it to Miami, they can thank all sorts of people for 
the trip, beginning with Frazier's replacement, Brook Berringer. Berringer, 
making only his fourth start, wasn't flashy, but he was much more effective 
than the highly touted Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 Protected by one of the best offensive lines in the country, Berringer 
completed 12 of 17 passes for 142 yards and a touchdown. And while nobody will 
confuse him with Frazier, he ran Nebraska's option play well enough to cause 
Colorado problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you're behind that offensive line," Berringer said, "you feel like 
you can drop back and pick the defense apart." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what he did. Using an assortment of new plays inserted for Saturday's 
game, Berringer found tight ends Eric Alford and Mark Gilman a combined nine 
times for 124 yards and the touchdown. When he wasn't doing that, he was 
handing off to fullback Cory Schlesinger (65 yards, one touchdown) or I-back 
Lawrence Phillips, who rushed for 86 yards but saw his string of eight 100-yard 
games end. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't prepared for the run when they started throwing like that," 
Colorado linebacker Matt Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Colorado wasn't prepared for much of anything. The Buffaloes were 0 
for 11 on third-down plays, 0 for 4 on fourth-down tries. And Stewart, for the 
second consecutive year, was awful against the Cornhuskers. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only bright spot was running back Rashaan Salaam, who gained 134 
yards in 22 carries for one touchdown. That and the won coin toss were about it 
for Colorado highlights. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just weren't Colorado today," Stewart said. "We went out there and just 
ran around." 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska led, 7-0, by the end of the first quarter, but it seemed like more. 
That's because Colorado's three possessions lasted 56 seconds, 53 seconds and 
95 seconds and started at its three-, 25- and 16-yard lines. It didn't get any 
better in the second quarter, as Nebraska added 10 more points and shut out 
Colorado in the first half for the first time in 28 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cornhuskers took a 24-0 lead early in the third quarter on a 30-yard pass 
play from Berringer to Alford and then waited for the clock to run out. 
Berringer made one silly mistake -- an interception that resulted in Salaam's 
touchdown run -- but that was it for Cornhusker errors. 
</P>
<P>
 While Osborne and the Cornhusker players might have been hesitant to pitch 
their case as the new No. 1, Colorado Coach Bill McCartney wasn't. To him, the 
vote is a no-brainer. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should get the distinction of the vote," he said. "Based on the fact 
that they decisively beat us." 
</P>
<P>
 This wasn't easy for McCartney to admit. Ever since 1982, his first season at 
Colorado, McCartney has treated the Nebraska game with a certain reverence. 
Much to the amusement of Nebraska, he announced that the Cornhuskers were his 
team's biggest rival and then promptly lost six of the next seven games against 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally infuriating to Colorado was the attitude of Osborne, who said he 
didn't know the Cornhuskers had a rival until McCartney said so. Even this 
week, Osborne acted as if he were preparing to face Pacific. He does it every 
year, and every year McCartney and the Buffaloes steam at the perceived slight. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, back in Boulder, Colorado players were treated to their annual 
red-fest. The Buffaloes' scout team wore red. Makeshift signs with the day's 
practice schedule were written in red magic marker. Red chalk found its way 
onto the team blackboard. And if the color overload wasn't enough, McCartney 
made sure to mention Colorado's visit to Memorial Stadium two seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, though, Colorado arrived in Lincoln with the nation's fourth-best 
running attack, not the 100th, as it did two years ago. Salaam, a little-used 
freshman in 1992, entered Saturday's game as the NCAA leader in rushing 
yardage. Stewart, who sat the bench for three quarters in 1992, started this 
time around. 
</P>
<P>
 Also different was Colorado's defensive line, called one of the best in the 
country by Nebraska assistant George Darlington, who has been at Nebraska 22 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Darlington was the same guy who mocked Kansas State and Missouri 
players and coaches for picking the Buffaloes over the Cornhuskers. During a 
speech earlier in the week to a Lincoln booster club, Darlington said his most 
pressing concern "is whether to forgo preparation for Colorado and start 
getting ready for Kansas because we are facing a team that nobody gives us a 
chance to defeat." 
</P>
<P>
 Darlington had the last laugh. So did the sweat shirt vendor who peddled his 
stuff near the Nebraska bookstore hours before kickoff. For $15 you could have 
bought the silk-screened shirt and the pregame prophesy that came with it.  
</P>
<P>
 No Fifth Down No Hail Mary No Chance. * NITTANY LIONS LOOK THE PART:

Ohio State its worst loss in 48 years, 63-14. C8

ZANINESS IN ZAIRE; A MEMORABLE CAST OF CHARACTERS AND A SHOCKING FINISH MADE 
THE ALI-FOREMAN FIGHT 20 YEARS AGO ONE OF SPORTS' GREATEST SPECTACLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Under moonlight at 3 o'clock in the morning, without a sound but frogs 
croaking in symphony along the banks of a mighty 2,900-mile river that coursed 
from the South Atlantic through the veins of Africa's continent, Muhammad Ali 
suddenly appeared, moving at a jogger's gait in heavy work boots. Right behind 
Ali, huffing and puffing, came another man, old enough to be his father. He was 
Norman Mailer, the noted author, who had persuaded Ali to permit him to tag 
along. 
</P>
<P>
 Mailer, short and stocky and dressed in gray sweats, began wheezing and pulled 
up, gasping, "Champ! Champ . . . I'm going to . . . I'm going to . . . stop." 
</P>
<P>
 He doubled over. On ran Ali, along the desolate pathway, a mile from the city 
lights of Nsele, away from the presidential compound and the estuary where two 
splendid craft were moored. One was the Mama Mobutu, a hospital ship. The other 
was a three-tiered luxury yacht belonging to Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu Wa 
Za Banga, ruler by revolution of the West African republic of Zaire, the former 
Belgian Congo, and reportedly the world's seventh-wealthiest man. 
</P>
<P>
 Flapping in the riverbank breeze from atop the yacht was the green national 
flag of Zaire, with its proud emblem, a hand clutching a torch. It was the 
stated goal of President Mobutu to expose the rest of civilization to the 
beauty and resources of his country. That explained why he had personally 
invited two internationally known figures of Western sport to stage a 
heavyweight championship fight right there in Zaire, baiting them with a 
previously unheard-of $5 million apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain things were obvious about Muhammad Ali and his opponent, George 
Foreman. One was that Ali was very possibly one of the two most famous living 
Americans of the autumn of 1974, the other, Richard M. Nixon, having weeks 
before resigned his position as President. The other was that Ali was no longer 
champion. Foreman was champion. And two things were as certain of Foreman as 
could be certain of anyone -- one, that he was as marvelous a specimen of 
physical manhood as one might find (and always would be), and two, that he was 
one surly SOB without an ounce of personality or sweetness (and always would 
be). 
</P>
<P>
 Mailer wanted to see Foreman's block knocked off and wanted to believe that 
Ali was still capable of doing so. Yet this was the Ali who had sacrificed his 
crown to a boycott of the Vietnam war based on religious beliefs, and it also 
was an Ali whose comeback had been interrupted by a wicked hook from Smokin' 
Joe Frazier, who with persistence had finally discovered a way to wallop one of 
the world's most elusive butterflies. Ali, quite possibly, was washed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Mailer had gone to Africa to write a nonfiction account of "The Rumble in the 
Jungle," as this fight was being advertised by some verbose ex-convict who had 
somehow talked his way into promoting his first big fight, a numbers runner 
from Cleveland who had been convicted of manslaughter named Don King. Also 
there were some of the author's contemporaries such as the Mitty-esque 
"participatory journalist" George Plimpton, assigned to the exotic location by 
Sports Illustrated to chronicle his experiences there, and Hunter S. Thompson, 
the so-called "gonzo journalist" who would eventually forward something to 
Rolling Stone magazine, soon as he got back from searching through the jungle 
for illegal elephant tusks, fugitive war criminals and Pygmies. 
</P>
<P>
 Most mornings, some or all of these correspondents could be found breakfasting 
at the Hotel Inter-Continental, where, beyond the balustrade, men made music on 
drums and xylophones. At a typical Inter-Continental breakfast, ceiling fans 
rotated above, customers sank into wicker plantation chairs and slim bellhops 
carrying chalkboards bearing messages tinkled Buddhist temple bells to page 
guests. Thompson, wearing aviator shades and Acapulco shirts and smoking with a 
cigarette holder, frequently tipped these bellhops to page R. Nixon or, more 
often, Martin Bormann, the Nazi war criminal who, Thompson had become 
convinced, was hiding out somewhere in the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 That morning, Mailer regaled listeners with the tale of his morning roadwork 
with Ali. After Mailer had stopped, Ali disappeared up a steep grade. The beep 
of a horn startled Mailer, who was passed by several members of Ali's 
entourage, following their idol in a Volkswagen van. Mailer gagged on its 
exhaust. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as he began the trudge back to town, from the pitch darkness Mailer 
heard another noise. Not frogs. Not a horn. This one was low and guttural -- 
frightening. It came from the nearby dense brush. Mailer paused, then pressed 
on. But after one more step, the clearing of a throat became a full-blown roar. 
The unmistakable roar of a lion. Mailer had seen enough MGM movies to know what 
one sounded like. He did not care to meet one in person. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he reached the hotel for breakfast, however, his close encounter 
with the real king of the jungle had taken on new cosmic significance in 
Mailer's mind. Something had suddenly occurred to this literary luminary -- 
wow, what a way to go. To be devoured in equatorial Africa by a savage lion, to 
become its brunch, what better way of meeting one's maker? Particularly one who 
believed himself so illustrious in life that all he really needed to be 
immortalized was a dramatic ending. Hemingway had his shotgun. Mailer would 
have his lion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Il a nourriture lion!" said one of the French-speaking Africans who 
surrounded Mailer's table, gabbing excitedly as they translated the writer's 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 ("He is the lion's food!") 
</P>
<P>
 And then they began laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 And so did Plimpton, who finally had to turn to Mailer, who had no idea what 
this was all about. 
</P>
<P>
 "Norman," Plimpton said. "No lions run free in this part of Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 And Mailer said, "You're nuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Plimpton shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, Norman," he said, breaking the news gently. "What you heard . . . was the 
Zaire zoo." 
</P>
<P>
 Whereupon some of the Africans around the wicker table began laughing again 
heartily, one of them scratching the air with his hand like a paw and roaring 
loudly, doing an imitation of a lion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fight went off on Oct. 30, 1974, not on schedule. In the weeks after 
Watergate and the resignation of Nixon, it was a transitional period in 
America, with war veterans out of work as well as their commander in chief. 
Americans were watching "Kojak" suck lollipops on television and listening to 
Bill Withers' "Use Me" on the radio and going to see the new Charles Bronson 
vigilante flick, "Death Wish," actually using the word flick. Two days before 
Nixon quit, a 24-year-old French stuntman named Philippe Petit had toed a 
tightrope 90 feet between the twin towers of the World Trade Center, 1,350 feet 
above the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon, whose situation had been far more precarious for months, climbed into 
his copter and did the V wave with his fingers, one last time. Days later, the 
world's attention began turning to a main event planned for Sept. 25 in faraway 
Kinshasa, Zaire, where, same as he had before fighting Sonny Liston, the 
pugilistic poet Ali was reciting some of his worst verse ever, while claiming 
that he would regain the title that was rightfully his. 
</P>
<P>
 His latest went: 
</P>
<P>
 "You think the world was shocked "When Nixon resigned? "Just wait till I whup 
"George Foreman's behind! "Float like a butterfly "Sting like a bee. "His hands 
can't hit "What his eyes can't see! "Now you see me. "Now you don't. "George 
thinks he will. "But I know he won't." Foreman, like Liston, wasn't having any 
of it. He was distant, sullen. He cared only for his two German shepherd pups 
and barely acknowledged his own press agent except when he needed an opponent 
for Ping-Pong. Everyone had come to fear Foreman, whose last act of civility 
had seemed to be waving a miniature American flag from the ring at the 1968 
Summer Olympics, where, as Ali had eight years before, he won a gold medal. On 
Jan. 22, 1973, Foreman knocked out Joe Frazier, destroyed him really, and 
seemed not only invulnerable but mean. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're young, you don't know what you're doing, you just want to knock down 
everybody that gets into your way," Foreman recalls in his hotel room in Los 
Angeles, preparing himself, astoundingly -- almost absurdly -- for another shot 
at the heavyweight title on Saturday, 20 years from the rumble in the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 "There I was in a business specifically made for guys exactly the opposite of 
me. Outgoing guys. Promotin' guys. You take Ali, he was what everybody called a 
'classy' fighter. A 'classic' boxer. But why was he a classic boxer? I remember 
hitting him in maybe the second round. I hit him so hard in the chest, pow! And 
he gave me a look like, 'I'm not going to stand here and take this!' And I gave 
him everything I had, and I remember him saying when the round was over 
(imitating Ali's whisper), 'I made it. I survived.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On the day Ali arrived at the airport for his flight, each of the men in his 
entourage wore a dashiki, or similar African tunic. The consciousness of being 
"Afro-American" was at an all-time high. Ali was proud to be associated with a 
boxing promotion that would involve black athletes, black promoters, black 
spectators, black politicians, black financiers. He felt fit and happy. Marvin 
Gaye's "Let's Get it On" boomed from the cassette player one of his bodyguards 
carried. He expressed no fear of Foreman. He didn't mind being a 7-1 underdog. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the actual day a Pan-Am pilot announced, "Please fasten your seat 
belts for takeoff." 
</P>
<P>
 And Ali yapped, "Superman don't need no seat belt!" 
</P>
<P>
 And a stewardess said, "Superman don't need no airplane." 
</P>
<P>
 Struck beneath the belt, Ali laughed aloud and enjoyed the transatlantic 
flight. Behind him, Mailer and Plimpton invented a game to pass the time, one 
they called "What do he do?" The object was to figure out who was whom among 
Ali's entourage -- and who did what? 
</P>
<P>
 Plimpton, over lunch 20 years later at a Los Angeles bistro, recounted that 
one fellow, hired as a chauffeur, was paid $50,000 for what Ali described as 
"driving and jiving." Another was a large man identified simply as Big Black, 
who was a professional drummer whose job was to beat on a drum whenever Ali 
landed a punch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another fellow was Ali's official sweat-taster," Plimpton added. 
</P>
<P>
 His what? 
</P>
<P>
 "This man's job was to sample Ali's perspiration after a workout to see if it 
tasted salty," Plimpton said.  
</P>
<P>
 So much for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 At the airport near Kinshasa, a poster of President Mobutu's bespectacled face 
was as large and prominent as Citizen Kane's when he ran for office. On the 
poster was written: "Un cadeau de President Mobutu au People Zairois." ("A gift 
of President Mobutu to the people of Zaire.") And below that: "Et un honneur 
pour l'homme noir." ("And, an honor for the black man.") French had been the 
official language of this region since King Leopold of Belgium declared it his 
personal property in 1884, yet about two-thirds of the population also spoke 
Bantu languages -- Hamitic, Nolotic, Sudanic and Pygmy dialects. 
</P>
<P>
 Off the plane stepped Ali. 
</P>
<P>
 "My country! My people!" he shouted to the gathered throng from atop a 
portable staircase. Mobutu himself had led a company of soldiers onto the 
Tarmac, literally rolling out a red carpet. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobutu saluted. 
</P>
<P>
 "My people!" Ali continued. "My people gonna put George Foreman in a pot and 
cook him!" 
</P>
<P>
 Translators whispered into Mobutu's ears. His expression changed. Such jokes 
did not amuse him. This was exactly the sort of dated stereotype of Africans by 
Americans -- even by Afro-Americans -- that infuriated him, that made him 
invite these fighters to Zaire to demonstrate how cultured and civilized West 
Africa had become. Ali's men yelled: "Right on!" They shook fists in 
brotherhood. Mobutu frowned. 
</P>
<P>
 A translator, Tshimpumpu wa Tshimpumpu, introduced himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Greetings on your safe arrival. I will serve as your press attache for the 
championship fight," the rotund Tshimpumpu said in excellent English. "On 
behalf of President Mobutu and our people, welcome! President Mobutu expresses 
his desire that I offer our nation's hospitality to the celebrated Monsieur 
Muhammad Ali, but also wishes to reassure you that there will be no cannibals 
cooking anyone in any pots." 
</P>
<P>
 Ali's entourage laughed. Mobutu's didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bienvenue," Mobutu said. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the rumble. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The landscape was lush and green, understandably so for a nation with 50 to 80 
inches of rain annually. There were cotton and coffee plantations visible from 
Ali's limo, roadside signs in both English and French. 
</P>
<P>
 Four signs in sequence, like Burma Shave ads, read: "We Want to Be Free." "Our 
Road of Progress Must Not Be Impeded." "Even If We Must Forge Our Way Through 
Rock." "Then We Will Forge Our Way Through Rock." 
</P>
<P>
 The limo traveled this road into the busy business district of Kinshasa, 
population 2.5 million, former vortex of slave and ivory traders, until 
recently known as Leopoldville. 
</P>
<P>
 Parakeets, hundreds of them, occupied an enormous cage in the lobby of the 
Hotel Inter-Continental. The concierge and other employees wore dark blue, 
no-lapel suits known as aboscos. After independence had been won from the 
Belgians, revolution was followed by a bloody civil war and public executions 
were carried out right here in the hotel, in this very lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, more fighting had come to Kinshasa. Two professionals would engage in 
hand-to-hand combat at the Stade du 20 Mai (Twentieth of May Stadium, named for 
independence day), and on the first day these gladiators were introduced to the 
locals, many of them began a chant that would become familiar in the weeks to 
come: 
</P>
<P>
 "Ali bome aye!  
</P>
<P>
 "Ali bome aye!"  
</P>
<P>
 Mailer recalled turning to Plimpton to ask what it meant. 
</P>
<P>
 He was told: "'Ali . . . kill him!"' 
</P>
<P>
 For his fame, for his nature, Ali had already become the people's choice. He 
had even embraced Mobutu on the stand, finding him rigid. The Zairois loved it. 
Foreman, meantime, strode into the football stadium with his two German 
shepherds, tall, dark and silent. He gave the leashes to two overweight men 
accompanying him. Then the crowd parted to let baleful George pass and mount 
the steps to the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Once atop it, Foreman spoke not one word. Instead he peeled off his warmup 
jacket, revealing his rippling bare physique. From the audience came an audible 
gasp. Foreman flexed, striking poses as a bodybuilder would. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forty fights, 40 victories, 37 knockouts," Plimpton said, from memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two things about Foreman," Mailer responded. "He'll never have much of a 
personality, but he's got that body." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, how things change. For one, no one envisioned Foreman ever being hurt. He 
seemed indestructible. At a sparring session, however, Foreman injured his 
forehead, necessitating a postponement of the fight. This agitated some of the 
tourists and journalists who had made the long journey, many of whom, Mailer 
among them, went home. 
</P>
<P>
 This also created a disturbance in the Nsele presidential compound of Mobutu, 
the one adorned with a gigantic pagoda donated to him by his good friends, the 
Communist Chinese. At the news of the postponement, Mobutu put his armed 
soldiers on full alert. He considered imprisoning Ali and Foreman, convinced by 
advisers that Foreman's injury was a dodge and that both fighters would return 
to America without refunding Mobutu's money. 
</P>
<P>
 Ali remained merry. He sang out, "I rassled with a gator! Tussled with a 
whale! I murdered a rock! Injured a brick! I'm so mean I make medicine sick!" 
</P>
<P>
 Mobutu's men kept an eye on Ali's trainer, Angelo Dundee, and his sycophant, 
Bundini Brown, and even his stunning wife, Belinda Ali, to gauge how restless 
any of them were getting. No one was to leave Zaire. And further agitating 
Mobutu was this chatterbox of a promoter, Don King, the great sesquipedalian, 
who was busy dispensing posters advertising this fight as "The Rumble in the 
Jungle," a name of King's own creation. That one was fine. But what Mobutu 
objected to was King's other brainstorm, a slogan that went: "From the Slave 
Ship to the Championship!" Mobutu ordered those posters burned. 
</P>
<P>
 He also burned tickets to the fight on which his name was misspelled. Costs 
were soaring. There had better be a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 It was reset for Oct. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "One fighter is a mute and the other never shuts up," Plimpton complained, as 
he remained behind for 55 days in Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Mailer, back again, had gone slightly mad, stepping out onto the terrace of 
his seventh-story room where there was no railing. Mailer said, "I find most of 
Zaire to have all the appeal of the Greyhound bus station in Easton, Pa." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson had taken a boat and a guide upriver toward the Ituri forest. He 
wanted to buy tusks. He wanted to find Martin Bormann, living in a hut. He 
wanted to find a Pygmy and he wanted somebody to tell him if a cobra could eat 
a Pygmy. Thompson also had taken to telling people that he was Foreman's 
personal doctor, and that he intended to remove George's lymph glands 24 hours 
before the fight. Africans nodded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went nuts myself," Foreman recalls. "I was having some crazy dream about my 
dogs wearing ice skates. Don't ask me why. But then, there really were people 
out to get me. People sending up food to my room, tryin' to make me sick. That 
was the only way they could beat George, same as today. Pull a trick on George. 
Use every trick in the book on George. That's what Ali did and that's what 
people been doing ever since." 
</P>
<P>
 When fight day arrived, Foreman was flustered. He had food-tasters sample 
every morsel. He sat alone, reading Superman comic books. He played Ping-Pong 
with his press agent, Bill Caplan, but didn't speak to him. Rain clouds arrived 
and Foreman's mood turned darker. Last-minute repairs had to be made to the 
ring, including installation of a canopy. Then Ali's guy, Dundee, had the ropes 
adjusted without Foreman's knowledge, loosening them. Inexperienced African 
laborers scrubbed the rosin from the canvas, mistaking it for dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Foreman suddenly announced the fight was off, unless he was paid up front 
for his next fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Ali was cool as could be. He killed time watching horror movies on TV, hiding 
his face behind a pillow as "Baron of Blood" with Joseph Cotten came on. Ali 
began referring to Foreman as "the Mummy." He said the films frightened him 
more than George did. 
</P>
<P>
 At ringside, Don Dunphy's familiar voice called into a microphone: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a beautiful evening here in Kinshasa, Zaire, for the heavyweight 
championship of the world. We're ready for the start of what may be an epic 
battle." 
</P>
<P>
 However, it wasn't evening. It was 4 a.m., but it was fight time anyway, 
thanks to a radio broadcast and closed-circuit telecast back to the States. 
Under skies that continued to threaten rain, Ali stepped into the ring wearing 
white trunks with a black waistband, having passed on the satin jacket with the 
map of Zaire on the back that Bundini Brown had begged him to wear. Foreman 
wore red trunks with a blue band and a "GF" monogram. He looked ferocious. 
</P>
<P>
 Plimpton said, "I'm afraid our friend Ali isn't going to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Mailer replied, "I'm afraid our friend Ali isn't going to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Above them, Ali's white trunks were pinned against the ropes. And his arms 
offered no resistance. Foreman was punching Ali's torso at will. Ali put up 
little defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunphy announced, "This is not the Ali we expect! He is not floating like a 
butterfly or stinging like a bee!" 
</P>
<P>
 Ali just stood there, getting hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Mailer said, "Oh, my God." 
</P>
<P>
 Plimpton said, "It's a fix." 
</P>
<P>
 On the apron, in the challenger's corner, Bundini Brown began to scream at 
Ali, "You crazy? You crazy? Get off them ropes!" 
</P>
<P>
 But on his stool, as an elegant African maiden in an ankle-length garment 
carried a card that read "ROUND 2," Ali heeded very little of what was being 
said to him at ringside or in his corner. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight continued. Mobutu sat up high, beneath an even larger poster of 
himself. Hunter Thompson was a no-show, having stayed behind at his hotel, 
totally strung out. Thousands of African people implored Ali to do something -- 
"Ali bome aye! Ali bome aye!" -- but all he did was sag against the loose 
ropes, taking punishment from Foreman's massive arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman, reflecting: 
</P>
<P>
 "That was my first experience with cowardice as strategy. I hit, I hit, I hit, 
and he grabbed, he held, he ran. And nobody told Ali once to come out of his 
corner and fight. They all said later it was the rope-a-dope -- he laid on that 
rope and I, like a dope, punched myself out. And all these years later, people 
still asking me, 'George, isn't it smart for a fighter to get out of the way?' 
And I still say, 'No, I would never be no coward. I got to face my kids.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But it worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, don't get me wrong, Ali clearly whipped me," Foreman said, with two 
decades to think about it. "It's the method that's so shameful. No honor in it. 
Ali was no coward. He did what he had to do, is all." 
</P>
<P>
 About Round 7, Ali struck back. Foreman was exhausted. His punches, even 
Dunphy observed, lacked the snap of those earlier in the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did it on purpose!" Mailer said. "He made Foreman tire himself out!" 
</P>
<P>
 Plimpton asked, "Aren't you glad we came?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ali's personal drummer, Big Black, began keeping time on his conga, bopping it 
with every Ali punch. Bundini Brown began hopping up and down. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunphy shouted, "A right to the jaw and George Foreman goes down!" 
</P>
<P>
 Cut like timber, Foreman toppled face forward. 
</P>
<P>
 A bald, African-American referee, Zack Clayton, bent over Foreman's body and 
counted to 10. Ali danced. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has regained the heavyweight championship of the world!" Dunphy cried. 
"Ali has done the impossible!" 
</P>
<P>
 And the clouds burst. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of hours later, a convoy of military Jeeps negotiated a muddy road on 
the Kinshasa outskirts, national flags waving from each antenna. A reception 
line of native sons and daughters, as far as the eye could see, stood protected 
from the rain by palm fronds. From a Citroen car in the middle of the military 
vehicles protruded the arms of Ali, slapping palms with the people he passed.  
</P>
<P>
 Ali eventually lost his title to Leon Spinks and lost much of his physical 
prowess and enthusiasm. Foreman quit boxing, became a minister and had many 
sons, all named George, then returned to boxing. Twice as cheerful and twice as 
large, he will attempt to regain his championship belt Saturday against Michael 
Moorer in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 He says, "You want to know something funny? When I'm with Ali now, I feel like 
taking care of him. Like he's my brother and he needs me. Ain't life funny?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mailer wrote a book about the fight called "The Fight," then ran for mayor of 
New York, unsuccessfully. 
</P>
<P>
 Plimpton, for his own amusement, boxed a round with Archie Moore, did a movie 
with John Wayne and played goalie for the Boston Bruins, same as he had once 
played quarterback for the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 They found Hunter Thompson floating naked in the pool at the hotel after the 
fight. Thompson squinted into the morning sun, looked up and asked, "Who won?"

JIM MURRAY: MELTING POT MELLS OF SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the summer of 1943, Roy Nakatani was incarcerated by the government of the 
United States of America for high crimes and misdemeanors.  
</P>
<P>
 What was his crime? Vote Communist, did he? Send death threats to the White 
House? On the FBI's Most-Wanted list?  
</P>
<P>
 Nah. He was one week old at the time. He was born in a prison camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, what were his parents doing there? What was their crime? Kidnaping? Bank 
fraud? Cheating on their income tax? Counterfeiting?  
</P>
<P>
 Nah. Theirs was a crime of geography. They were born in the wrong place at the 
wrong time. In this case, Japan.  
</P>
<P>
 Roy Nakatani was born in what was euphemistically noted as a "relocation 
camp." English translation: prison camp. Life behind barbed wires. Under 
machine guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly America's finest hour, but the world was at war. But we didn't ship out 
German-Americans or Italian-Americans, only Japanese-Americans. They were, in 
effect, prisoners of war even though they had never opened fire on anyone and 
were as loyal Americans as Nathan Hale.  
</P>
<P>
 The story has a happy ending in the best traditions of the American 
experience, the melting pot, the land of the free.  
</P>
<P>
 The Nakatanis, who were L.A. residents when the war broke out, were 
"relocated" (imprisoned) first in Colorado, but, when their son was born in 
camp there, they were transferred to the relocation center at Santa Anita.  
</P>
<P>
 And, as Shakespeare would have it, thereby hangs a tale.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, if you were paying attention, you noticed the racing card at the Oak 
Tree meeting at Santa Anita the other day and took into account the fact the 
eighth race was won by a brown colt named Smooth Runner. The rider on him was 
"Nakatani." 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly. On the very plot of ground where his father took his first toddling 
steps under armed guard, Corey Nakatani won his 23rd race of the meeting and 
the 992nd of his career. Corey is the leading rider at Oak Tree at the moment 
and on the verge of becoming the country's leading rider. It's enough to make 
you want to break into chorus of "America The Beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 The story is in the best traditions of the American Dream. Roy Nakatani 
returned from detention camp to grow up in L.A. and eventually became an MTA 
bus driver whose route took him to the racetrack at Santa Anita. The venue had 
no sad memories for him because he didn't remember all that much about it. He 
had been too young at the time and his parents rarely spoke about it.  
</P>
<P>
 So, Roy Nakatani was drawn to racing at Santa Anita, where he once lived in a 
tent, and he soon imbued son Corey with the same emotions and affection for the 
racing game.  
</P>
<P>
 Corey, who topped out at 5-foot-1, 110 pounds (he would have been a twin but 
the brother died at birth), got on every horse he found standing still. He went 
to jockey school at Castaic. He worshiped Laffit Pincay and studied films of 
every stakes ride Pincay ever took. He pestered trainers, owners, stewards. He 
walked hots, he exercised horses at dawn, he mucked stalls. He rode everything 
he could get a leg on. He rode at fairgrounds, training strips, and he pestered 
his idol Pincay into sharing his agent, Tony Matos. Laffit finally sighed and 
did -- just to get some peace.  
</P>
<P>
 Corey rode some horses who should have been pulling a plow. His riding style 
was modeled after a sword-swinging Cossack. He never got on anything less than 
20-1. He rode bridle-path horses. He rode claiming horses, not Derby horses. He 
rode not at Santa Anita and Belmont but at places such as Galway Downs and 
Stockton and his first "win" was a dead heat at Caliente. They thought he was 
Japanese around the track and some used to speak to him in pidgin English. 
Actually, his mother was Irish and Corey was as American as John Kennedy. But, 
Matos didn't help any (although he was trying to) when he tried to get Corey 
live mounts by telling the trainers he was Japan's leading rider. At the time, 
the closest Corey had been to Japan was Santa Monica, but he didn't mind. He 
would have done anything to get a 2-1 shot. 
</P>
<P>
 He used to make horse run like a cop busting up a crap game. He didn't ride a 
horse, he bullied him. But gradually, as he studied the master riders, he came 
to realize that horses, like people, respond better to coaxing than caning. He 
toned down his terrorism. "Laffit told me that patience wins more races than 
punishment and that the best way to pick a horse up in the stretch was to build 
his confidence. It's better to surprise a horse than to terrify him." 
</P>
<P>
 It was valuable lesson. Nakatani today is as deft a rider as there is at Oak 
Tree, which has as skilled a colony of jocks as the turf offers. He is not only 
the leading rider at this meet, he was the leading rider at the Del Mar meet 
just competed. He is at least the equal of McCarron, Stevens, Pincay, 
Desormeaux and Delahoussaye. The other afternoon at Oak Tree, he rode in seven 
races. He won one and finished second in three others. He had his 23 victories 
in only 18 days of the meeting.  
</P>
<P>
 But it's not about win, place or show for the Nakatani story. It's about a 
Nakatani making his first million dollars at a place where his grandparents and 
parent were, so to speak, POWs. For no reason. They were not spies, they were 
gardeners.  
</P>
<P>
 The grandparents are dead now, but it's about their grandson becoming a famous 
American and having three children of his own, Brittany, 4, Matthew, 2, and 
Austin, 5 months (he married Michelle Dollase, daughter of trainer Wally 
Dollase). And it's about a Nakatani being cheered where once they were jailed. 
From prison camp to winner's circle, from tin cup to silver trophy, it's 
America's real way to make amends. Not by Congressional reparation. That's the 
political way. That's not the American way. The Statue of Liberty can stop 
blushing.

 The city recently opened a $135-million indoor sports facility and next fall, 
the $260-million indoor football stadium will be ready for use.

OILERS SHOW RAIDERS IT COULD BE WORSE; PRO FOOTBALL: HOUSTON HAS FALLEN ON HARD 
TIMES, LIMPING INTO COLISEUM TODAY WITH 1-6 RECORD.

<P>
 Finally, a farewell to arms. Big arms. Strong arms. Proven arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the Raiders don't have to face a quarterback with the potential to 
dominate the airspace above the playing field. Three weeks ago, it was Drew 
Bledsoe of the New England Patriots, the hottest young quarterback in the 
league. Two weeks ago, it was Dan Marino of the Miami Dolphins, one of 
football's hottest quarterbacks for a decade. And last week it was Jeff George 
of the Atlanta Falcons, who got hot when he finally got out of Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the Raiders will face . . . who knows? 
</P>
<P>
 Not only don't the Houston Oilers, today's opponent at the Coliseum, have a 
proven arm to lead them, they don't even know from week to week whose arm it 
will be. 
</P>
<P>
 And this week is no different. 
</P>
<P>
 Cody Carlson will start today if his sore knee allows him. If not, it will be 
backup Billy Joe Tolliver. 
</P>
<P>
 Where is Warren Moon when you really need him? 
</P>
<P>
 With the off-season trade of Moon to the Minnesota Vikings after a decade as a 
fixture in Houston, the Oilers installed Carlson, his longtime backup, as the 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carlson has spent as much time in the trainer's room as on the field in 
what was supposed to be his big chance after seven seasons of standing on the 
sideline. Carlson, who has suffered nose, shoulder and knee injuries, has sat 
out three of Houston's seven games and has been taken out of the last two he 
started. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the Raiders faced the Oilers, at the Astrodome in the exhibition 
season finale, Bucky Richardson, a third-year veteran from Texas A&M, was the 
local favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 But his star has faded and he has been replaced by Tolliver, another former 
Texas collegiate star serving as the latest Oiler relief ace. Tolliver, who 
played at Texas Tech, is in his sixth NFL season and on his third team after 
previous stops in San Diego and Atlanta. Signed in the second week of the 
season by Houston, Tolliver has come out of the bullpen in each of the Oilers' 
last two games, relieving Richardson against the Cleveland Browns and Carlson 
last Monday night against the Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers lost both games, but that's nothing new. They have lost six of 
seven this season in a dramatic plunge from the ranks of playoff contenders 
after reaching the postseason in seven consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if Houston can still salvage this season, Oiler defensive back Cris 
Dishman said: "I don't think we have the talent there. We lost a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm wishing and hoping and praying that we can do it, but it takes each 
individual to look at themselves and realize they've got to step their game up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've still got a chance to make the playoffs if we win (the remaining) nine 
games." 
</P>
<P>
 Right. Or if they can lure Moon back from Minnesota. That's about as likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how much the Oilers miss Moon, Dishman said: "Drastically. We miss 
Warren in the community. We miss Warren on the field. We miss him off the 
field. And Warren's leadership at halftime too. If we were behind or we were 
ahead, Warren would say some things that would get everyone to realize what's 
going on. We drastically miss him, but we can't cry over spilled milk." 
</P>
<P>
 There's plenty to cry over if you're an Oiler fan looking at the combined 
numbers put up by Moon's replacements. Carlson, Richardson and Tolliver have 
completed only 48.9% of their passes, for eight touchdowns with an equal number 
of interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cody's getting better all the time," Pardee said. "His knee's not completely 
well. . . . He can't take his right steps. As he gets stronger, he certainly 
knows where to go with the ball and all that. It's just, without the right 
steps, the ball sails on him occasionally." 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback isn't the only place Houston is having trouble. Gary Brown, coming 
off a 1,000-yard rushing season, was expected to assume the role of featured 
back. But an ankle injury has kept him out of two games and limited him to 364 
yards rushing. That has forced the Oilers to go back to another of their former 
1,000-yard rushers, Lorenzo White, who wasn't even in the picture for 1994 when 
they went to camp.  
</P>
<P>
 The defense has been respectable, keeping the Oilers in games by giving up 
301.9 yards a game, second-lowest total in the AFC behind the Pittsburgh 
Steelers. Even so, there are indications that some players are already writing 
this season off. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could bring in Jimmy Johnson, Vince Lombardi or Tom Landry, and it's not 
going to change anything this season," receiver Ernest Givins told the Sporting 
News. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Raiders thought they had problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders (3-4) hope their troubles are finally behind them. With the 
dispute between Coach Art Shell and quarterback Jeff Hostetler in the rear-view 
mirror and the offense coming off its best effort of the season last week in a 
victory over the Falcons, the Raiders are optimistic that the second half of 
the season will reduce the strife and inconsistency of the first half to a 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Holes in the offensive line were filled effectively last week by Robert 
Jenkins and Greg Skrepenak. Harvey Williams seems finally established as the 
starting tailback. 
</P>
<P>
 The only question mark is at free safety where Eddie Anderson, bothered by a 
groin pull, might have to give way to second-year player Patrick Bates today. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody is ready yet to repeat the preseason prediction that the Raiders are 
headed for the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 But if they want to assure themselves that things could be a lot worse, all 
they have to do today is look across the line of scrimmage.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL SPOTLIGHT; BETTER LATE THAN NEVER FOR THE "ICEMAN" DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Around Kutztown, Pa., the biggest question throughout the football season has 
been: "When will the 'Iceman' play?" 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, that question was answered when Chuck (The Iceman) Roseberry, a 
46-year-old grandfather of four, played for three downs in Kutztown's 18-14 
home loss to Shippensburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Roseberry, a 6-foot-4 sophomore defensive tackle, entered the game to a 
standing ovation with 4:14 remaining in the second quarter with Kutztown ahead, 
14-3. On first down, Roseberry was slow to react to the snap and was blocked by 
Shippensburg's 6-foot-4, 271-pound tackle Dwaine Shultz. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought they were going to double-team me, so I hesitated to see who was 
going to block me," said Roseberry, who had played in his last football game as 
a senior at Warren Hills High of Washington, N.J., in 1965. "That's why I 
didn't get off the ball so well." 
</P>
<P>
 On second down, Shultz knocked Roseberry down with a block and then smashed 
Roseberry's helmet into the grass after the play. 
</P>
<P>
 "After he did that, (Shultz) said to me, 'How's that old man?' " Roseberry 
said. "I said, 'I'm fine. Just bring it again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On third down, Roseberry played Shultz to a standstill on a pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I took two steps out on the field, the crowd went crazy, it was bedlam," 
Roseberry said. "The kids (Roseberry's teammates) said, 'Are you ready?' and I 
said, 'Are you kidding? I've been waiting all my life for this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Roseberry was in for three plays. His statistics: zero tackles, zero assists, 
zero sacks, zero interceptions, zero forced fumbles and zero fumble recoveries. 
</P>
<P>
 Kutztown Coach Al Leonzi said Roseberry will travel with the team for the 
final two road games at Towson State and East Stroudsburg State. WATCH OUT PENN 
STATE, HERE COME THE DUCKS 
</P>
<P>
 After upsetting No. 11 Arizona, 10-9, Oregon has a chance to do something it 
has not done in 37 years. Play in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 With a 4-1 Pacific 10 Conference record, Oregon is tied for first place. The 
Ducks have defeated two of the teams they are tied with, USC and Arizona, but 
lost to Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the 1957 Oregon team, which is the last to play in the Rose Bowl, 
were honored guests at Autzen Stadium and watched as Oregon's "Gang Green" 
defense was just as dominating as Arizona's touted "Desert Swarm." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obviously a surprise that Arizona and Oregon were playing a game of this 
importance, not from Arizona's standpoint but from ours," Oregon Coach Rich 
Brooks said. "Most of the preseason polls picked Oregon to be eighth or ninth 
or 10th in the league." TAKE THIS SIGN AND . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska quarterback Brook Berringer had a difficult time trying to ignore a 
sign on a wall behind the Cornhuskers' bench before their home game against No. 
2 Colorado. The sign read: 
</P>
<P>
 "Quarterback. We don't need no stinkin' quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 To answer his critics, Berringer completed 12 of 17 passes for 142 yards and 
one touchdown in an effort that would have made even injured starter Tommie 
Frazier proud. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like everybody on this team has a lot of confidence in me and that 
I've shown a lot of poise and leadership," said Berringer, who has recovered 
from a collapsed lung he suffered early in the season. "I hope everyone is 
convinced now. I think that I've put all the doubts -- if there were any left 
-- aside." . . . AND THE GOAL POST TOO 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska fans let ESPN's Lee Corso know how they felt about his pre-game 
prediction that Colorado would win. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans ripped down the goal posts following Nebraska's 24-7 victory and 
deposited part of one on the set used by the ESPN television crew. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't out of line with our image as classy fans," a Nebraska student 
said. "I mean, hey, we put the thing on the guy's desk, we didn't beat him with 
it or hang him from it!" TIRED LEGS 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Mickens rushed for more than 200 yards for the eighth consecutive game 
and broke the NCAA Division I-AA single-season rushing record as Butler 
defeated Evansville, 49-14, at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickens, a transfer from Indiana, scored three touchdowns and gained 244 yards 
to total 2,111 yards this season, breaking the 11-year-old record of 2,016 held 
by Akron's James Black. . . . MORE TIRED LEGS 
</P>
<P>
 Undefeated Allegheny (Pa.) gained an NCAA Division III record 774 yards in 
total offense and had five players rush for at least 60 yards in a 62-7 defeat 
of Wooster (Ohio). 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Bremer ran for 109 yards on 18 carries and two scores, John Jones ran 
for 90 yards and two touchdowns on nine carries and Mark Schiano caught two 
touchdown passes from Paul Bell for the Gators. HEISMAN MATERIAL 
</P>
<P>
 Steve McNair continued to make his case for being the nation's top player when 
he broke the Division I-AA career passing yardage record in leading Alcorn 
State back from a 35-7 deficit to tie Samford, 45-45, at Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 McNair, who completed 37 of 63 passes for 563 yards and four touchdowns, 
scored on a six-yard run with 55 seconds remaining, then scored the two-point 
conversion to tie the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not cocky or arrogant, but if they pick the best college football 
player," McNair said, "I believe I am the best college player out there." 
</P>
<P>
 McNair broke the passing record in the third quarter, with an 11-yard 
completion to Kobie Jenkins to bring his career total to 13,487. The previous 
record of 13,220 was held by Neil Lomax of Portland State from 1977-80. 
FOURTH-STRING STARTER 
</P>
<P>
 In Cal's 26-23 loss to Washington State, the injury-riddled Bears were forced 
to use wide receiver Ziv Gottlieb at quarterback for most of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Gottlieb, a native of Israel who attended Beverly Hills High, was a backup 
quarterback last year as a freshman and switched to wide receiver before this 
season. He was five of 11 for 61 yards and had six carries for 17 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't quite turn out the fairytale ending, but I just gave my all," 
Gottlieb said. "My lack of snaps contributed to the confusion." 
</P>
<P>
 With starter Dave Barr out for the season because of a broken collarbone, 
second-stringer Pat Barnes sidelined with a bruised nerve in his shoulder and 
third-stringer Kerry McGonigal down with a shoulder separation, Gottlieb might 
get the call again next week at Arizona. WHAT'S NEXT, A NUMBER ON THE 
HUFFINGTON NANNY? 
</P>
<P>
 Did Stanford's band, all 100 or so irreverent members, tone it down Saturday? 
It depends on whether you are a proponent of Prop. 187 and a fan of Gov. Pete 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinal band wasn't, but Wilson and the proposition got off comparatively 
light, compared to O.J. Simpson. The band had done a halftime show lampooning 
Simpson's troubles two weeks ago when Stanford played USC. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, 23 band members played outside the Los Angeles County Courthouse 
during the Simpson jury selection process, and when he saw them on CNN, Ted 
Leland, Stanford's athletic director, said enough. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the band would not perform at halftime of the UCLA game at the Rose 
Bowl on Saturday, then changed his mind 20 minutes before game time, allowing 
for the relatively tame spoof on Prop. 187 and Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a set of guidelines that the band has to work in, but somehow they 
always find a way to offend somebody with their shows and stay within the 
guidelines," Leland said. "Who would have thought they would have been able to 
go to court and get on CNN news?" 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody who knows the Stanford band. CAN YOU SAY MEDIOCRITY? 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since 1984 and only the second time in Southwest Conference 
history, the football champion will have two losses. At least. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 80th and second-to-last SWC season, Rice, Texas Christian, Texas Tech, 
Baylor and No. 19 Texas are tied for first and all have at least two losses. 
Houston is 1-3 and Southern Methodist is 0-4-1 after a 21-21 tie with No. 7 
Texas A&M, which is 4-0-1 but ineligible for the title because of NCAA 
violations. QUOTEFEST 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Hey Gibbs, Delta is ready when you are." -- A banner flying over the 
stadium in Norman had this message for Oklahoma Coach Gary Gibbs, whose team 
fell to 4-4 after a 37-20 loss to Kansas State. NOTEWORTHY

DEFENSE DOES IT ALL IN FLORIDA'S 52-14 VICTORY; SEC: UNIT SHUTS DOWN GEORGIA, 
INTERCEPTS FOUR OF ZEIER'S PASSES AND SCORES THREE TOUCHDOWNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Florida's high-powered offense stood on the sidelines while an opportunistic 
defense made sure the No. 5-ranked Gators rebounded from their first loss of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Criticized for giving up the winning touchdown in the final minute of a loss 
that cost the Gators the No. 1 ranking two weeks ago, the defense redeemed 
itself during a 52-14 rout of Georgia on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit scored twice on interception returns and also ran back a fumble for a 
touchdown, while holding the top offense in the Southeastern Conference to 292 
yards -- 200 yards below its average. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I care about is who won the game," said Georgia Coach Ray Goff, who has 
lost five in a row to Florida. "You can't turn the football over four times and 
expect to beat many people, especially when three of them go for touchdowns." 
</P>
<P>
 The rain-drenched victory moved Florida (6-1, 5-1), coming off a 36-33 loss to 
Auburn, a step closer to the Southeastern Conference championship game for the 
third consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida can clinch the league's Eastern Division title by winning one of its 
two remaining SEC games against South Carolina and Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense matched the Gators' powerful offense touchdown for touchdown for 
three quarters. Two of the scores came in the final 95 seconds of the first 
half, leaving Georgia's Eric Zeier with little alternative but to throw every 
down to try to get the Bulldogs (5-4, 3-4) back into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave out more defensive game balls than in any of the 100 victories I have 
as a coach," Florida Coach Steve Spurrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeier moved into fourth place on the Division I-A career passing list, 
completing 28 of 45 for 261 yards, but was intercepted a career-high four times 
before leaving the game early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Wuerffel, meanwhile, made sure there won't be a lingering debate about 
Florida's quarterback situation. The sophomore threw for 209 yards and two 
touchdowns in his first start of the season, and Spurrier allowed one-time 
Heisman Trophy hopeful Terry Dean to mop up at the end.

SOUTHEASTERN ROUNDUP; DAVIS RUNS FOR 246 YARDS, RESCUES AUBURN 
</P>

 Stephen Davis did his best Bo Jackson imitation Saturday and wound up with 
some Bo-like numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 On a day when No. 4 Auburn seemed primed for an upset, Davis made sure it 
didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
 He rushed for a career-high 246 yards and scored three fourth-quarter 
touchdowns to help the Tigers rally for a 31-14 victory over Arkansas at 
Auburn, Ala., extending the nation's longest Division I-A winning streak to 19 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis had rushed for at least 100 yards in two consecutive games and four 
times overall this season, but he was told by running backs coach Rodney 
Allison to take his play to another level against the Razorbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said we needed a 200-yard game rushing today," said Davis, whose previous 
career best was 158 yards in the season opener. "I took it upon myself to carry 
the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Auburn, 8-0 overall and 5-0 in the Southeastern Conference, trailed, 14-10, 
entering the fourth quarter, the 11th time the Tigers have fallen behind during 
their nearly two-year winning streak. Then Davis took over. 
</P>
<P>
 On the third play of the fourth quarter, the 223-pound junior powered over 
from the one to put Auburn ahead to stay against Arkansas (3-5, 2-4). On the 
Tigers' next possession, Davis burst around right end for a 24-yard touchdown 
to push the lead to 24-14. 
</P>
<P>
 He capped his performance with a 53-yard run down the right sideline, 
streaking past the smaller defensive backs with a glimpse of the speed that 
made him a high school track star in South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis would have pushed the 300-yard mark had a 42-yard run in the first 
quarter not been nullified by a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Auburn struggled much of the game, falling behind in the first quarter when 
nose guard Junior Soli picked off Patrick Nix's pass and returned it 51 yards 
for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Auburn, which vaulted into national championship contention two weeks ago with 
a 36-33 upset of then-No. 1 Florida, managed only a 33-yard field goal by Matt 
Hawkins in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers went ahead for the first time when Nix found Frank Sanders alone in 
the end zone for a 44-yard touchdown pass with 8:52 left in the third quarter. 
Sanders finished with seven receptions for 128 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 But Arkansas didn't fold. The Razorbacks drove back down the field, going 76 
yards in 12 plays for Barry Lunney's one-yard touchdown on a quarterback sneak. 
That turned out to be the only bright spot for the Arkansas' offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Mississippi 34, Louisiana State 21 -- Josh Nelson passed for three touchdowns 
and Dou Innocent had his third consecutive 100-yard rushing game as the Rebels 
broke a four-game losing streak at Oxford, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
 Mississippi, which had scored only one offensive touchdown in each of its 
three previous games, led early in the second quarter, 21-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rebels (3-4, 2-5) hadn't beaten an SEC team since a 20-14 victory over 
Vanderbilt on Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 LSU (2-5, 2-4) lost three fumbles in the first quarter, the last leading to a 
six-play, 68-yard Mississippi drive that ended with Mark Smith's three-yard 
touchdown run with 12:21 left in the second quarter. Smith, who had 16 carries 
for 79 yards, also had a 59-yard run during the drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee 31, South Carolina 22 -- Freshman Peyton Manning passed for three 
touchdowns, two to James Stewart, at Columbia, S.C., as the Volunteers (4-4, 
3-3) won for the third time in four games. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning, the son of Archie Manning, completed 19 of 23 passes for 189 yards, 
with the scoring passes to Stewart covering six yards and one yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Mississippi State 47, Kentucky 7 -- Kevin Bouie rushed for a school-record 217 
yards and one touchdown in 23 carries and Derrick Taite had touchdown passes on 
plays covering 34 and 31 yards as the Bulldogs (6-2, 3-2) recorded their most 
lopsided victory in their 22-game series with the Wildcats (1-7, 0-6). 
</P>
<P>
 Coming into the game, Bouie had only 273 yards in 68 carries this season. But 
the senior topped the school rushing mark of 198 yards set by Dennis Johnson 
against Memphis in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Davis scored on a 13-yard run in the second quarter for his 25th 
touchdown, a Mississippi State record. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanderbilt 17, Northern Illinois 16 -- With the score tied, 10-10, late in the 
third quarter, Eric Vance intercepted a pass and returned it 44 yards, setting 
up Jermaine Johnson's nine-yard touchdown run to help the Commodores (4-4) nip 
the Huskies (3-6) in a nonconference game at Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Northern Illinois pulled within a point with 1:02 to play when George Anthony 
scored from the two, but Gerald Collins and Anthony Azama stopped Sean Allgood 
short on a two-point conversion run.

STENSTROM'S BEST NOT QUITE ENOUGH; STANFORD: HE PASSES FOR 408 YARDS, PUTS 
CARDINAL IN POSITION TO WIN, BUT FIELD-GOAL TRY MISSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stanford quarterback Steve Stenstrom won't remember the 408 passing yards he 
collected against UCLA Saturday, a personal best and a UCLA record for an 
opposing quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 He won't remember the first-quarter touchdown drive that put him over 10,000 
passing yards for his career, making him only the 10th NCAA Division I-A player 
to amass that many yards, not including bowl games. Nor will he take 
consolation in throwing the two touchdown passes that brought him within five 
of the Pacific 10 record of 77, as his mother and father sat in the Rose Bowl 
stands and applauded. 
</P>
<P>
 Perfectionist that he is, Stenstrom instead will recall what went wrong and 
wonder how he might have made it come out right in Stanford's 31-30 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I'll think about the positives. I tend to reflect on 
everything I could have done differently," said Stenstrom, from El Toro High. 
"I'm going to think about this one for a long, long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Stenstrom didn't need to see the the game films. He was already replaying 
everything in his mind, viewing it with a clarity sharpened by a keen sense of 
regret. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what I could have done," he said. "I could have hit Justin (Armour) on 
that crossing pattern (on third and goal from the five-yard line early in the 
fourth quarter). I'm going to relive having somebody stepping on my foot (to 
blunt a touchdown drive on third and goal at the one in the third quarter). 
</P>
<P>
 "And that batted ball down at the other end of the field: Justin was wide open 
(but linebacker Phillip Ward intervened). I'm going to think about the fact we 
were down inside the five twice and didn't get a touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
 His thoughts were especially melancholy because as a senior, Stenstrom won't 
play again in Southern California as an amateur. Saturday's loss wasn't how he 
wanted to write the final chapter to that part of his career, despite his 
28-for-45 performance and the line he etched in UCLA's record book. The 
previous record for most passing yards by a Bruin opponent was 387 by 
Tennessee's Tony Robinson in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a little sentiment attached to every game this season," Stenstrom 
said. "And I have a lot of respect for UCLA. It's been a great, fun career for 
me. I'm going to miss a lot of the situations I've been in during these years 
and the opportunity to play UCLA." 
</P>
<P>
 In his last opportunity against the Bruins, whom he had burned for 313 years 
and three touchdowns last year, he thought he would grab a last-minute victory. 
Getting the Cardinal into field-goal position with a rapid-fire succession of 
six passes, he had no doubt they would rally. "I thought it was done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His teammates thought so too. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did exactly what we wanted to do," said Armour, the senior wide receiver 
who caught 11 Stenstrom passes for 220 yards, including a 17-yard catch over 
the middle for the Cardinal's first touchdown. "That's how you write it up and 
dream it will end. Everything worked exactly like we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Everything up to the final field-goal attempt by Eric Abrams. 
</P>
<P>
 And even then, Stenstrom thought the 32-yarder had sailed through the uprights 
instead of drifting wide to the left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was good for sure," he said. "It's hard to tell field-goal 
angles, so you have to trust the official had a better angle. My initial 
reaction was elation, a tremendous feeling. All of a sudden, it hit me and it 
was the exact opposite. I found myself on my back. I couldn't believe it had 
happened." Air Stenstrom 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Stenstrom's 408 yards passing against UCLA on Saturday made him the 10th 
player in NCAA Division I-A history to pass for more than 10,000 yards.

HUARD LIFTS WASHINGTON PAST OREGON STATE, 24-10; PAC-10: QUARTERBACK PASSES AND 
RUNS FOR THREE TOUCHDOWNS AS KAUFMAN IS LIMITED TO 69 YARDS.

<P>
 Oregon State's wishbone dominated and the Beavers' defense contained Napoleon 
Kaufman. But thanks to Damon Huard, No. 15 Washington still managed to win 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Huard passed for two touchdowns to Eric Bjornson and ran for another in a 
24-10 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman, the leading rusher in the Pacific 10 Conference, was held to a 
season-low 69 yards in 21 carries, with a long gain of 19 yards. He lost 
yardage in six of his carries. 
</P>
<P>
 And Oregon State, 2-6 overall and 1-5 in the Pac-10, had the ball 11 minutes 
more than the Huskies -- 35:34 to 24:26. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oregon State geared their entire defense to stopping Napoleon, which really 
opened up our passing game," Huard said. "If they give me man coverage and Eric 
and I get our timing down, I know they can't stop us." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Washington Coach Jim Lambright, whose team is 6-2 and 3-2: "Oregon State 
controlled the clock. That Oregon State team scared me to death. They're close 
to busting out on someone." 
</P>
<P>
 Huard, who completed 10 of 17 passes for 151 yards, played well despite 
lingering injuries of bruised ribs and a bruised knee he suffered in a loss to 
Oregon last week. He wore a brace on his right knee and a flak jacket to 
protect his ribs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Damon was hurting all this week and didn't practice much," Bjornson said. "It 
really pumps the guys up when you see a guy playing with a brace. It's real 
inspirational."

COUGARS FALL BEHIND BY 18 BUT RALLY TO WIN; PAC-10: WASHINGTON STATE DEFEATS 
CAL, 26-23, AFTER TRAILING IN FIRST QUARTER, 20-2.

<P>
 Washington State's stingy defense took over when the offense and special teams 
combined to drop the No. 22-ranked Cougars into an 18-point hole against 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense, which entered the game as the nation's stingiest unit, recovered 
five fumbles and intercepted a pass as Washington State, 6-2 overall and 4-1 in 
the Pacific 10 Conference, rallied for a 26-23 victory on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told our team there were two ways to win this game," Washington State Coach 
Mike Price said. "We could go out there and break their backs, get on them 
right away and score, or we could hang with them and keep it close and win it 
in the end. I guess I shouldn't have talked about Plan B." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Truant's 34-yard field goal with 5 1/2 minutes to play broke a 23-23 tie 
and completed the comeback against injury-riddled Cal, which was forced to use 
wide receiver Ziv Gottlieb at quarterback for most of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Bears (3-5, 2-3) had a chance to win, reaching the Washington State 
23 in the closing seconds. But a holding penalty and two motion penalties 
forced Ryan Longwell into a 57-yard field-goal attempt as time expired. It was 
wide right. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal's third-string quarterback, Kerry McGonigal, was knocked out of the game 
when he suffered a left shoulder separation early in the third quarter. 
First-stringer Dave Barr is sidelined for the season because of a broken 
collarbone and Pat Barnes sat out because of a bruised nerve in his shoulder.

WESTERN ATHLETIC ROUNDUP; BROWN LEADS UTAH IN ROUT OF UTEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charlie Brown tied a school record by running for four touchdowns and gained 
143 yards in 18 carries as No. 12 Utah ran over Texas El Paso, 52-7, on 
Saturday at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even know I'd carry the ball that much," Brown said. "I thought Rob 
Hamilton was going to be the man. But I got my chance and I gave it everything 
I had." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton, the Utes' fullback, gained only 31 yards as the 5-foot-9, 192-pound 
Brown dominated the running game. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's four touchdowns matched a record last equaled in 1988 by Eddie Johnson 
against Brigham Young and helped Utah, 8-0 overall and 5-0 in the Western 
Athletic Conference, to its best record since 1930. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a more mature runner now," Brown said. "Instead of waiting for a big 
hole, I just take any crease and hit the line with all my force." 
</P>
<P>
 Utah quarterback Mike McCoy completed 25 of 36 passes for 391 yards, with one 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of McCoy's touchdown passes were to Deron Claiborne, who led the Utes with 
seven catches for 128 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew we could do this to them," McCoy said. "We knew the things that would 
work, and we did them. It was a matter of going out and playing our kind of 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 While Utah racked up 628 yards in all, its defense -- ranked first in the WAC 
and eighth nationally -- held UTEP (3-6, 1-5) to 288 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego State 38, Hawaii 23 -- Wayne Pittman rushed for a career-high 183 
yards and two touchdowns in 33 carries at San Diego to help the Aztecs (4-5, 
2-4) hand the Rainbows (2-6, 0-6) their fifth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Blanton of San Diego State completed 20 of 28 passes for 236 yards and 
two touchdowns, with two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii hurt itself with six turnovers, including five interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico 49, Fresno State 32 -- Stoney Case passed for two touchdowns and 
ran for three to lead the Lobos (3-6, 2-3) over the Bulldogs (4-5, 2-3) at 
Fresno. Case ran for 114 yards in 16 carries and completed nine of 14 passes 
for 199 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico, seventh nationally in total offense, racked up 565 yards, 89 more 
than its average. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno's Adrian Claiborne completed 18 of 32 passes for 196 yards and two 
touchdowns, with two interceptions, and Jerome Oliver rushed for 167 yards in 
24 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force 34, Wyoming 17 -- Preston McConnell passed for touchdowns of 39, 24 
and 23 yards and ran 78 yards for another score to lead the Falcons (5-3, 4-2) 
over the Cowboys (4-5, 2-3) at Laramie, Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time since Oct. 14, 1989, that Air Force, which relies on a 
wishbone offense, had passed for three touchdowns.

PLUMMER HELPS ARIZONA STATE WIN; NONCONFERENCE: HE PASSES FOR CAREER-HIGH 327 
YARDS AND THREE TOUCHDOWNS IN 36-15 VICTORY OVER NO. 20 BYU. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Arizona State Coach Bruce Snyder thought he knew exactly where to hurt 
20th-ranked Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out he did, and he had the quarterback -- Jake Plummer -- he needed 
to bring off a stunning 36-15 upset on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think BYU's secondary is the area where we thought we could make some 
yardage," Snyder said, "and it turned out to be that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Plummer passed for a career-high 327 yards and three touchdowns, with no 
interceptions, was sacked only once and even ran for 26 yards. BYU's secondary, 
suspect all season, couldn't match the speed of the Sun Devil receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 ASU (3-5) so completely dominated the game that BYU's homecoming crowd of 
65,208 had markedly thinned by the fourth quarter. BYU (7-2) was never in the 
game, falling prey to two fumbles and an interception in the first half. 
Arizona State led, 23-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The score was 36-7 in the final minute before BYU scored on a 10-yard pass 
from John Walsh to Mark Atuaia. Walsh also completed the two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Plummer, a sophomore, outplayed Walsh throughout, picking apart the porous BYU 
secondary. Arizona State's Jon Baker kicked field goals of 20, 42 and 38 yards 
in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 BYU scored early in the second half on a quirky 70-yard play. It started with 
Walsh passing 10 yards to tight end Chad Lewis, who, while in the grasp of 
defenders, pitched to running back Jamal Willis, who ran 60 yards for the 
score. 
</P>
<P>
 The score made it 23-7 and excited the crowd. But Plummer immediately slammed 
the door on any hope of a Cougar comeback with touchdown pass plays of 44 yards 
to Terry Battle and 83 yards to Keith Poole to make the score 36-7 with 4:22 to 
play in the third quarter.

 Freshman Zebbie Lethridge passed for three touchdowns to help Texas Tech upset 
No. 19 Texas, 33-9, on Saturday at Lubbock, Tex., to keep alive the Red 
Raiders' hopes of playing in the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Tech, 4-4 overall and 3-2 in the Southwest Conference, jumped to a 21-0 
lead and Texas (5-3, 2-2) was unable to challenge.The Longhorns were bothered 
by an offense that sputtered and a defense that gave up 111 yards rushing in 28 
carries to another freshman, Byron Hanspard. 
</P>
<P>
 Lethridge, who completed 12 of 24 passes for 153 yards, passed for touchdowns 
of 25, seven and 10 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of 45,591, biggest at Jones Stadium this season, watched Texas Tech 
post only its 11th victory and its biggest margin in a 44-game series dating to 
1928. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Christian 27, Rice 25 -- Max Knake passed for four touchdowns and Andre 
Davis ran for 221 yards to lead the Horned Frogs at Ft. Worth, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 TCU (5-3, 2-2) re-entered the conference title chase on a day that left five 
of the seven contenders with two losses and no clear leader of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 TCU won for the second consecutive week, pulling itself from an 0-2 SWC hole 
and ending a two-game losing streak against Rice (3-4, 2-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Baylor 52, Houston 13 -- Brandell Jackson scored two touchdowns and Baylor's 
defense produced three interceptions and a blocked punt at Waco, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second-worst defeat Baylor (6-3, 3-2) has inflicted on Houston 
(1-7, 1-3) in the 27-year history of the series.

TIE FEELS LIKE A LOSS FOR NO. 7 TEXAS A&M; SWC: AGGIES OVERCOME A 14-0 DEFICIT 
BUT FALL SHORT OF VICTORY AGAINST SMU, 21-21. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Texas A&M lost a tie game on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the scoreboard said it was a 21-21 tie with Southern Methodist, there 
was no way the seventh-ranked Aggies could consider it anything less than a 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even great teams have to lose sometime," said Rodney Thomas of the Aggies, 
who ran for three touchdowns. "You remember when it happens and it gets you 
refocused on what it takes to win. We got that feeling back of what it's like 
to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Perfect through seven games, the Aggies were among a handful of undefeated 
teams with legitimate shots at a national title. That is all over now for Texas 
A&M, as is its 26-game Southwest Conference winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't play very well, and SMU did. They took it to us," Texas A&M Coach 
R.C. Slocum said. "We figured it would happen sooner or later. We just didn't 
know who or under what circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 When Kyle Bryant's 67-yard field goal-attempt dropped short with one second to 
play, the Aggies were left at 7-0-1 overall and 4-0-1 in the Southwest 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant's attempt came 28 seconds after SMU's Ben Crosland was wide right on a 
43-yarder that would have given SMU (1-7-1, 0-4-1) one of the biggest upsets in 
years in college football. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think my adrenaline took over," Crosland said. "It was only a 43-yard 
attempt and I think I kicked it too hard." 
</P>
<P>
 SMU Coach Tom Rossley said his team "dedicated (itself) in practice this week 
to play their best game of the year. The defense turned in an extra special 
performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Texas A&M had to rally merely to tie the game after SMU built a 14-0 halftime 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, who ran for 134 yards, got the first of his three touchdowns on a 
57-yard run in the third quarter and caught a 25-yard touchdown pass from Corey 
Pullig early in the fourth. The Aggies trailed, 14-13, when Keith Waguespack 
missed the conversion attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Pullig lost a fumble at the Texas A&M 29, setting up Ramon Flanigan's second 
touchdown, a three-yard run with 8:12 to play that boosted SMU's lead to 21-13. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' 35-yard touchdown run with 6:18 to play brought Texas A&M within 21-19 
and Pullig tied the score with a pass to Brian Mitchell for a two-point 
conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think we executed well on offense," Flanigan said. "We just made the 
plays when we had to. . . . But we did put some points on the board."

BIG EIGHT ROUNDUP; KANSAS ST. ROLLS OVER OKLAHOMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chad May broke the game open with two third-quarter touchdown passes, Ron 
Brown scored twice and No. 23 Kansas State forced five turnovers in defeating 
Oklahoma, 37-20, on Saturday at Norman, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats, 5-2 overall and 2-2 in the Big Eight, scored more points than 
they had in 39 previous trips to Norman, and have won consecutive games against 
Oklahoma for the first time since 1969-70. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma (4-4, 2-2) lost three fumbles and two interceptions in falling to its 
worst eight-game record since 1965, when it was 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had what, five or six turnovers today?" Coach Gary Gibbs said. "We had 22 
going into the ballgame and you add five more and you have 27, and you're not 
going to be a good football team. It's just not going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sooners even tried a no-huddle offense, but not much worked. Along with 
the turnovers, they had a punt blocked, another punt deflected, fumbled a punt 
return and had a botched conversion attempt result in two points for the 
Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
 May passed for only 115 yards, fewest of his two-year Kansas State career, but 
he made the Sooners pay for their inability to take advantage of great 
first-half field position. 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri 34, Iowa State 20 -- Jeff Handy passed for 320 yards and directed 
Missouri's three longest touchdown drives of the season at Ames, Iowa, as the 
Tigers kept Iowa State winless. 
</P>
<P>
 Handy completed 20 of 31 passes, including a 23-yarder to Lamont Frazier for a 
touchdown, in leading Missouri (3-5, 2-2) to season highs for points and total 
offense (498 yards). 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa State (0-7-1, 0-3-1) faces the prospect of its first season without a 
victory since 1930, when it was 0-9. It finishes against No. 23 Kansas State, 
No. 3 Nebraska and No. 2 Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas 24, Oklahoma State 14 -- L.T. Levine broke for a 61-yard touchdown run 
on the Jayhawks' second play at Lawrence, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fifth consecutive victory for Kansas (5-3, 2-2) over Oklahoma State 
(3-4-1, 0-3-1) and kept alive the Jayhawks' hopes for a bowl bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine finished with 161 yards.

BIG TEN ROUNDUP; WISCONSIN EUPHORIC AFTER 31-19 UPSET VICTORY OVER MICHIGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How big was Wisconsin's 31-19 upset of No. 10 Michigan on Saturday? Bigger 
even than winning the Rose Bowl last season, if you can believe the Badgers. 
</P>
<P>
 The running of Brent Moss and the passing of Darrell Bevell lifted the Badgers 
to the victory at Ann Arbor, Mich., ending two weeks of bitter frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 During the week leading up to this game, Wisconsin Coach Barry Alvarez 
questioned the Badgers' enthusiasm. He suggested cliques had formed to alienate 
the offense and defense. 
</P>
<P>
 But those things were forgotten in the euphoria of beating Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a huge game, bigger than the Rose Bowl," said Bevell, who completed 18 
of 26 passes for 161 yards and three touchdowns. "We just wanted to get back to 
playing our kind of football. We wanted to get our respect back." 
</P>
<P>
 The return of Moss helped make it all possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss, who sat out a tie against Purdue and a loss to Minnesota, rushed for 106 
yards and a touchdown in 26 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely gave the team a lift," Moss said. "They were excited I was 
coming back. I was excited I was coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 The Badgers, 4-3-1 overall and 3-2-1 in the Big Ten, came up with three 
interceptions and three sacks against Michigan (5-3, 3-2), which had won 11 in 
a row over Wisconsin at Michigan Stadium since 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, let me say that was a very important win for our football 
program, maybe more so than the Rose Bowl," Alvarez said. "I don't know if I've 
been more proud of a group of kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois 28, Northwestern 7 -- Johnny Johnson passed for two touchdowns and 
junior linebacker Simeon Rice dominated defensively for the Illini at Evanston, 
Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwestern (3-4-1, 2-3) had hoped to use the game as a springboard to its 
second-ever bowl bid but now needs to win its three remaining games, including 
the finale against No. 1 Penn State, to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 The Illini (5-3, 3-2) entered the game as Big Ten leaders in every defensive 
category. And except for Steve Schnur's 64-yard touchdown pass to Chris Gamble 
as the first half ended, they dominated the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice had three of Illinois' six sacks, deflected two passes and hurried Tim 
Hughes into interceptions that set up Illinois' first two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue 21, Iowa 21 -- Purdue's Brad Bobich missed a 30-yard field-goal attempt 
wide left with seven seconds to play at West Lafayette, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue (4-2-2, 2-1-2), which had driven 80 yards to tie the score on a 28-yard 
pass from Billy Dicken to Brian Alford and a conversion run by Dicken, had kept 
Iowa (3-5-1, 1-4-1) in its territory for most of the first three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawkeyes didn't get past Purdue's 32 until the fourth quarter and overcame 
a 13-0 deficit with a 1-yard run by Kent Kahl, a 38-yard run by Jefferson Bates 
and a 39-yard run by Sedrick Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Both starting quarterbacks were knocked out with injuries. Dicken, who had 
thrown only 12 passes in three appearances this season, replaced starter Rick 
Trefzger on Purdue's second possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Trefzger injured his left knee scrambling for a 7-yard gain and watched the 
second half on the sideline. Iowa starter Mike Duprey left the game with an eye 
injury in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan State 27, Indiana 21 -- Tony Banks and Nigea Carter hooked up for a 
school-record 93-yard touchdown pass play and Marc Renaud scored twice and 
gained 181 yards for the Spartans at East Lansing, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory ended a three-game losing streak for Michigan State (3-5, 2-3). 
Indiana (5-3, 2-3) lost its second in a row despite the hard-nosed running of 
Alex Smith, who ran for 100 yards in 19 carries to become the fourth Big Ten 
freshman to rush for 1,000 yards.

PENN STATE MAKES A STRONG CASE TO KEEP ITS PLACE AT NO. 1; BIG TEN: CARTER RUNS 
FOR FOUR TOUCHDOWNS AND COLLINS PASSES FOR TWO IN 63-14 ROUT OF OHIO STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Penn State was tired of hearing that the winner of the Colorado-Nebraska game 
would take over the Nittany Lions' place as the No. 1 team in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 That meant it was going to be a long day for Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State handed the No. 21 Buckeyes their worst loss in 48 years, a 63-14 
defeat before a Beaver Stadium-record crowd of 97,079. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we made a statement today," quarterback Kerry Collins said. "We beat 
a good team and we won resoundingly. I'd be miffed if we weren't No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nittany Lions knew third-ranked Nebraska had defeated second-ranked 
Colorado, 24-7, so they didn't waste any time trying to impress voters. They 
were up at halftime, 35-0, led by Ki-Jana Carter, who grew up 10 minutes from 
the Ohio State campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter ran for four touchdowns and 137 yards in 19 carries, leaving in the 
third quarter with the score 49-7. Collins, the nation's top-rated passer, 
engineered five long drives and completed 19 of 23 passes for 265 yards and two 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't concerned with the Colorado-Nebraska score today," said defensive 
tackle Chris Mazyck, who returned an interception for a touchdown. "We have to 
tend to our own knitting." 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State Coach Joe Paterno would not be dragged into the debate over No. 1. 
Instead, he echoed the thoughts of Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne, who left it to 
the voters to decide the best team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see Tom Osborne arguing that his kids are No. 1 . . . and I don't see 
any reason I should," Paterno said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nittany Lions, 7-0 overall and 4-0 in the Big Ten, sent Ohio State to its 
most lopsided loss since 1946, when it was defeated by Michigan, 58-6. Only a 
touchdown in the final three minutes helped the Buckeyes avoid their worst loss 
since 1902, an 86-0 beating by Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was absolutely embarrassing," cornerback Marlon Kerner said. "Not even in 
my wildest dreams did I imagine they would put up this big a win." 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State (6-3, 3-2) fell two games behind Penn State in the race for a Rose 
Bowl berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State's national title hopes might have been hurt when Oregon upset No. 9 
Arizona, 10-9, meaning the Pacific 10 Conference representative in the Rose 
Bowl will have at least two losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just going to go out there and win every game and we'll worry about the 
polls January 3rd," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Engram had six catches for 102 yards, including one touchdown and a 
highlight-film grab. With 3 1/2 minutes left in the half, Engram ran a short 
pattern and slipped, but he was able to recover and make a diving, one-handed 
catch at the Ohio State 36. 
</P>
<P>
 On the next play, Carter burst up the middle and broke Tito Paul's flying 
tackle for his third touchdown to make the score 28-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter also scored on the Lions' first possession, a 20-yard run up the middle 
helped by blocks from Keith Conlin and Engram. 
</P>
<P>
 With 56 seconds to play in the half, Ohio State quarterback Bobby Hoying threw 
a fluttering pass that Brian Miller intercepted at the Nittany Lion 43. 
Television replays showed that the ball bounced off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Three consecutive completions and a five-yard run set up Penn State's next 
score. Collins threw a high pass to Mike Archie, who leaped and held on to the 
ball despite being hit by safety Tim Patillo. Penn State led, 35-0. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first play of the second half, Carter fumbled and Ohio State's Matt 
Bonhaus recovered. That set up a 14-yard touchdown pass from Hoying to Chris 
Sanders, but the conversion attempt failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State came right back, marching 58 yards in only four plays for another 
score.

 Emmett Mosley ran for four touchdowns and tackle Alton Maiden returned an 
interception for a score as Notre Dame, smarting from a two-game losing streak, 
defeated Navy, 58-21, on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Derrick Mayes caught touchdown passes of 60 and 20 yards, giving him eight for 
the season, one short of a school record. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory came at a crucial time for Notre Dame (5-3), which is unranked for 
the first time since 1986 and will play No. 9 Florida State at Orlando in two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame's defense played a big part in the game, holding the Middies (1-7) 
to 10 yards rushing in the first half and setting up two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Maiden intercepted Jim Kubiak's pass at the Navy 44 and returned it to the end 
zone with 4:02 to play in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Bill Wagasy recovered a fumble on the Navy 21 to start a Notre Dame 
drive that ended with Mosley's fourth touchdown run with 13:36 to play.  
</P>
<P>
 Navy scored first on Kubiak's 32-yard pass to Ross Scott only three minutes 
into the game. But that was it for Navy, which hasn't beaten Notre Dame in the 
annual series since Roger Staubach, on his way to the Heisman Trophy, 
engineered a 35-14 victory in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley, who had rushed for only 81 yards this season, had an 11-yard touchdown 
run five minutes into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 A Notre Dame drive stalled after quarterback Ron Powlus suffered an ankle 
injury, and Scott Cengia kicked a 38-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Powlus returned early in the second quarter.

FLORIDA STATE GIVES DUKE A TASTE OF REALITY; ACC: KANELL PASSES FOR 394 YARDS, 
THREE TOUCHDOWNS AS NO. 9 SEMINOLES ROMP OVER PREVIOUSLY UNBEATEN BLUE DEVILS, 
59-20.

<P>
 Danny Kanell wasn't worried, but he was tired of hearing about Florida State's 
offensive problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we had to get something going," he said after passing for 394 yards 
and three touchdowns in less than three quarters to propel No. 9 Florida State 
to a 59-20 victory over previously unbeaten and 16th-ranked Duke on Saturday at 
Tallahassee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were sick and tired of all the criticism we've been taking," said Kanell, 
who was benched in the fourth quarter of Florida State's last two games after 
failing to move the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanell passed for 225 yards in a 32-point second quarter as the Seminoles, 6-1 
overall and 6-0 in the Atlantic Coast Conference, streaked to a 38-6 halftime 
lead on their way to a conference record 22nd consecutive ACC victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was much braver with his throws and that's what we told him to do," 
Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden said. "We wanted him to let 'er rip." 
</P>
<P>
 The Seminoles, who haven't lost in the ACC since joining the league in 1992, 
surpassed Maryland's mark of 21 in a row against conference opponents under 
Coach Jerry Claiborne in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rest of the league is competitive, but not like this," Duke quarterback 
Spence Fischer said. "Until someone can compete with their speed, it's going to 
be awhile before they lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Kanell, who hadn't passed for a touchdown since Florida State's 31-18 victory 
over North Carolina five weeks ago, passed for 332 yards in the first half, 
with Kez McCorvey catching eight passes for 195 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got shellshocked in the second quarter on both sides of the ball," Duke 
Coach Fred Goldsmith said. "We'll get over it and grow. That's part of life." 
</P>
<P>
 McCorvey finished with 10 catches for 207 yards to become only the second 
receiver in school history to have more than 200 yards receiving in a game. Ron 
Sellers did it five times. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke's Robert Baldwin, the ACC's top rusher, gained 96 yards in 22 carries, 
including a 44-yard run late in the third quarter. He became only the third 
Duke back to run for more than 1,000 yards in a season. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke's offense didn't score until late in the third quarter when Corey Thomas 
pulled Fischer's pass away from James Colzie in the end zone for a 29-yard 
touchdown play. Baldwin added a touchdown midway through the fourth quarter on 
a 13-yard pass from Fischer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Devils (7-1, 4-1) scored in the second quarter when Tijan Redmon went 
seven yards with a fumble by Colzie on a punt return. 
</P>
<P>
 Zack Crockett scored three touchdowns on short runs for Florida State and 
'OMar Ellison pulled in two of the scoring passes from Kanell on plays covering 
24 and 36 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Cooper also caught a scoring pass, Warrick Dunn scored on a 32-yard run 
and freshman quarterback Thad Busby added a one-yard touchdown late in the 
game. Dan Mowrey kicked six extra points and a 28-yard field goal in his first 
start since the 1992 season.

BIG EAST ROUNDUP; DEFENSE DOES JOB FOR MIAMI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Middle linebacker Ray Lewis made 17 tackles, broke up four passes and 
intercepted one to help No. 6 Miami defeat Virginia Tech, 24-3, in a Big East 
game Saturday at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hurricanes' defense forced three turnovers, had six sacks and held 
Virginia Tech to minus-14 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hurricanes (6-1, 3-0) have won their three Big East games by a combined 
86-12, and the defense has yet to give up a touchdown in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 13 Virginia Tech (7-2, 4-2) is 0-12 against Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hurricanes took control by scoring 17 points in the final nine minutes of 
the second quarter to lead, 17-3, at halftime. Defense set up two of the 
scores, giving Miami possession at the Virginia Tech 47 and 13 following a punt 
and a fumble forced by Kenny Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis snuffed out the Hokies' last chance for a victory, making an 
interception at the Miami 30 in the third quarter when the score was still 
17-3. He returned the interception to the Hokies' 45, and Miami scored eight 
plays later on Danyell Ferguson's two-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami faces No. 14 Syracuse in a Big East showdown Saturday at Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 45, Temple 19 -- John Ryan had his second big game since coming off 
the bench two weeks ago, passing for 330 yards and four touchdowns as the 
Panthers (2-7, 1-4) stopped a six-game losing streak by beating the Owls (2-6, 
0-4) at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, who lost his job in training camp after starting 10 times last season, 
completed 18 of 39 passes for 330 yards in his second start this season. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first on Oct. 15, he passed for 433 yards and four touchdowns against 
West Virginia, and he has passed for 763 yards and eight touchdowns in two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Davis caught two touchdown passes and Billy West, the Big East's leading 
rusher, ran for 149 yards to break the 1,000-yard mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston College 30, Army 3 -- Omari Walker scored on three short runs and the 
Eagles (4-2-1) held the Black Knight wishbone to 83 yards rushing to win at 
West Point. Army fell to 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston College scored 17 points in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 West Virginia 52, Louisiana Tech 16 -- Vann Washington had interception 
returns of 97 and 67 yards for touchdowns and the Mountaineers (4-5) of the Big 
East rushed for 328 yards in routing the Bulldogs (1-7) of the Big West at 
Morgantown, W.Va.

ANALYSIS; SECOND-HALF GAMES FAVORABLE TO RAMS IF THEY PICK UP PACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams have reached midseason 3-5 for the fourth time in the past five 
years, are now halfway to Baltimore or St. Louis and remain a million miles 
away from the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Two and a half years into Chuck Knox's rebuilding plan and the Rams are 2-14 
in NFC West Division games, 0-4 this season and cellar dwellers once again. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the credibility of a head coach measured in his team's record? 
</P>
<P>
 "That may be true, and then again it might not be true," Knox said. "I mean, 
the season isn't over. I think the time to make that determination is when it's 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, 14-26 under Knox and 22-50 since last appearing in the playoffs, 
have not won seven games in a season since 1989. A second-half schedule, 
however, allows the Rams to play six of their eight games in California and 
ends promisingly with games against New Orleans, Tampa Bay, Chicago and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 But how can the Rams count on better results when in Knox's three years on the 
job they have failed to win two consecutive games? 
</P>
<P>
 This season the Rams appear improved on defense, and yet their defense ranks 
No. 27 in the league in first downs given up and No. 27 in the league in 
stopping the opposition on third down. 
</P>
<P>
 Special teams received a boost with the hiring of coach Wayne Sevier, and yet 
the Rams rank No. 27 in the league in kick return yardage given up and No. 26 
in punt return yardage given up. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams paid $9 million to sign quarterback Chris Miller for the next three 
years, but they seem more interested now in starting Chris Chandler, who will 
be a free agent at season's end. Miller, Chandler, Everett, Rubley -- does it 
matter? Under Knox the Rams have emphasized the run, and have scored more than 
20 points only 11 times in 40 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition, meanwhile, has scored more than 20 points on 22 occasions, 
including 14 times in which they scored 30 or more. While the opposition has 
had a good time at the Rams' expense, local attendance has dropped to an 
average of 41,130. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the first eight games of 1994, which produced results similar to 1992 
and 1993, why should anyone think the second half of this season will be any 
different? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I think, one, if we get a couple of people healthy, and two, we've been 
in three games that we should have, could have had a chance to win," Knox said. 
"And they played hard. The schedule doesn't get any easier, but we just got to 
take it one game at a time and go and do it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, here's a look back -- one position at a time -- on the first 
half of the season: QUARTERBACK 
</P>
<P>
 Knox raved about Miller's accuracy in training camp, but a pulled abdominal 
muscle, stretched rib cartilage, jammed shoulder and concussion had fans in the 
stands ducking for cover every time Miller threw the ball, and Knox pushing 
Chandler to save the day. Chandler got hurt, and Tommy Maddox demonstrated why 
Denver was willing to unload the former No. 1 pick for a third-round choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-half possibilities: If Miller stays out of training room, the passing 
game gets healthy and the team wins more than it loses. If Miller stumbles, 
providing Knox with opening to play Chandler, there is a quarterback 
controversy and the team continues to flounder. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a thought: Miller has completed 51.2% of his passes, and Detroit's Scott 
Mitchell, who was No. 1 on the Rams' free agent wish list, has completed 48.8% 
of his. RUNNING BACK 
</P>
<P>
 Jerome Bettis' 200 carries represents 43% of the Ram offense, which explains 
why the Rams have a losing record. Bettis, of course, is one of the game's best 
running backs, but Ground Chuck is 3-8 in games in which Bettis runs for more 
than 100 yards. Bettis' ability to gain 723 yards behind a crumbling offensive 
line is an amazing feat, but team needs more zip in its passing game to keep 
Bettis on the move and put more points on the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-half possibilities: Where's Johnny Bailey, the team's most explosive 
back? Although he leads the team in receptions with 23, he has carried the ball 
only three times. Imagine Bailey and Bettis in the same backfield. Imagine 
Bailey and Troy Drayton on the field at the same time. Imagine the Rams scoring 
more than two touchdowns on offense in the same game for the first time since 
Oct. 14, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a thought: If Rams persist in throwing the ball to Jerome Bettis and Tim 
Lester, shouldn't the equipment manager outfit each with hockey goalie masks to 
keep them from getting hurt? RECEIVERS 
</P>
<P>
 If this coaching staff had Frank Thomas, they would employ him as a 
pinch-hitter. If this coaching staff had Hakeem Olajuwon, they wouldn't let him 
play until he improved on his three-point shooting. This coaching staff has 
Troy Drayton and the Rams are 3-5. Drayton continues to spend much of his 
Sunday standing on the sideline although he leads the team with four 
touchdowns. Why isn't he leading the team in receptions? Flipper Anderson 
remains a home run threat, and if you can guess the second-leading touchdown 
scorer, you no doubt are also making plans to accompany the team to St. Louis 
or Baltimore. Answer: Isaac Bruce with three. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-half possibilities: Drayton and more Drayton. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a thought: Who needs Henry Ellard? OFFENSIVE LINE 
</P>
<P>
 Miller has a history of getting hurt, so the Rams assign Chuck Belin, Keith 
Loneker, Wayne Gandy and Clarence Jones to protect him. Jones has actually 
distinguished himself for the most part, but then that's in comparison to 
Gandy, who failed as a No. 1 pick to beat out a guy released by the New York 
Giants. Tom Newberry, who was considered too small to play this game anymore, 
is now offensive team captain and starting center. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-half possibilities: When Darryl Ashmore's knee allows him to play and 
Jackie Slater's triceps heals, do Rams stick with Gandy as starter? Why not 
move him to guard? 
</P>
<P>
 Just a thought: Ten years from now, Slater turns 50 and receives telegram from 
stock broker Gandy, who congratulates Slater on playing in his 412th game. 
DEFENSIVE LINE 
</P>
<P>
 First clue of how bad this season was going to go was when that little kid 
manhandled Sean Gilbert in commercial. Preseason injuries to Gilbert and Fred 
Stokes and slow start by Robert Young got pass rush off to inconsistent start. 
Saints ran over D'Marco Farr, forcing training staff to work overtime to get 
Gilbert healthy again. Young has as many sacks (6) as Gilbert, Stokes, Jimmie 
Jones, Farr and Gerald Robinson combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-half possibilities: First three games after bye feature John Elway, 
Jeff Hostetler and Steve Young; pass rushers best be ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a thought: Who paid ESPN to liken this group to the Fearsome Foursome? 
LINEBACKERS 
</P>
<P>
 Shane Conlan, the Chris Miller of defense, looks like a man who spends spare 
time as speed bump on I-5, and yet he leads the team in tackles. Roman Phifer 
has big-play potential and Joe Kelly packs a wallop, but whatever happened to 
Henry Rolling? 
</P>
<P>
 Second-half possibilities: Crack in foundation spotted when Saints found 
running game at Rams' expense. If Raiders can run on these guys, there goes the 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a thought: Rams running out of time to tie up Phifer with new contract. 
DEFENSIVE BACKS 
</P>
<P>
 Most improved lot here, and because of youth figures to get even better. 
Marquez Pope, acquired in trade from Chargers, has made huge impact, and 
rookies Toby Wright and Keith Lyle have bolstered special teams as well as 
secondary. Todd Lyght has shut down game's top receivers and Darryl Henley has 
been worth every bit of that bail money. Anthony Newman even has an 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-half possibilities: Rams rank No. 27 in stopping opposition on third 
down; improved pass rush would make these guys look better in critical 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a thought: How do you explain the draft expert, who picked promising 
players such as Wright and Lyle, being so foolish as to also take Brad Ottis? 
Brad who? The big guy on the bench. SPECIAL TEAMS 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Zendejas has made 10 consecutive field goals, and there you have the Ram 
offense. Sean Landeta has been just as effective punting the ball and Todd 
Kinchen's 31.3-yard average returning kicks has been a plus. Special teams, 
however, have allowed one punt and two kickoffs to be returned for touchdowns, 
which figured directly into two defeats. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-half possibilities: Knox points to David Lang injury as part of reason 
for team's woes. What? Lang has lower kickoff return average than Bailey, 
Kinchen and Chris Brantley. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a thought: Zendejas has best percentage in NFL history kicking field 
goals from 50 yards or beyond, so why have Rams elected to punt rather than go 
for the three points from that distance this season?

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / MIKE HISERMAN: INCIDENT IS NOT WORTH SANCTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The rule book has been read, the film given a once-over, and coaches and 
players from the Sylmar and Poly high football teams are bracing for the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven players from Sylmar and five from Poly were ejected from a game Friday 
night after partaking in a little push 'n' shove dance that caused a 20- minute 
delay during the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes the fun part: An attempt by school administrators to figure out who 
did what to whom, perhaps even why, and what to do about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomorrow, Sylmar Athletic Director Bob Miller and his counterpart from Poly, 
Jerry Cord, are supposed to pore over film, conduct interviews, discover the 
truth and determine the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentlemen, good luck. You'll need it. We've already had the pleasure of 
interviewing your star witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Poly Coach Tim Feeley has come to the conclusion that "the Sylmar guys (were) 
at fault for starting the fight." 
</P>
<P>
 What an upset. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar Coach Jeff Engilman watched the same game and similar film only to 
determine that Poly players were at fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine that. 
</P>
<P>
 For the time being, let's forget about passing judgment and focus on the 
obvious: It takes two (or more) to tango. Players from both schools share the 
blame for what developed into an embarrassing spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
 Kudos to the game officials who handled it by providing players time on the 
bench to cool off. We can only hope school and district administrators show 
similar good judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 One superior has already warned Engilman to anticipate "some type of 
disciplinary action" against the ejected players. One-game suspensions are a 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeley, who hasn't been threatened, says he hopes that doesn't happen to his 
Valley Pac-8 Conference rival. "I hope administrators don't overreact about 
this. Sylmar needs their kids and we need our kids. This is football. That 
stuff happens." 
</P>
<P>
 You just heard the voice of reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Though two newspaper accounts described the tiff as a "brawl," Engilman says 
he didn't see a punch thrown. "Just a lot of pushing and shoving," is the way 
he described it. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeley claims his team will be quick to forget the incident should that be 
allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to win our next two games to get in the playoffs," he said. "That's 
what we're worried about." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar and Poly share what can be classified as a typical high school rivalry, 
illustrated by two incidents that took place in the week leading up to the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Monday night, Poly quarterback Ricardo Gamboa, receiver Jaime Cerna and 
another teammate were playing catch on the Poly football field. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerna gave his car keys to a friend to hold. A short time later, that friend 
decided to walk over to the Poly gym to watch a girls' volleyball match against 
-- you guessed it -- Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 After a while, fearing his friend might leave the school with his keys, Cerna 
jogged over to the gym looking for him. Inside, Cerna was recognized by Mike 
Cervantes, a member of Sylmar's football team. 
</P>
<P>
 Insults and challenges were exchanged. The Sylmar player went so far as to bet 
$20 that the Spartans would keep Cerna out of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 A former Sylmar teammate of Cervantes went even further. "If you're so good," 
the former defensive back told Cerna, "let's go out on the field right now and 
you can try to prove it." 
</P>
<P>
 So off into the night they went, headed for the Poly field. Gamboa throwing 
the ball and Cerna running patterns against a lone former Sylmar player. 
Cervantes stayed inside, no doubt chuckling to himself about earning easy 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days later, less than six hours before the start of the game, the Sylmar 
offense was walking through plays in street clothes when a car pulled up filled 
with young men shouting insults. 
</P>
<P>
 Draped out of one of the car's windows was a Poly football uniform, No. 11. 
Cerna's number. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the game, as players representing both teams met at midfield for the 
coin toss, the Sylmar captains demanded that Cerna explain his disrespectful 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even know what they were talking about," Cerna said. 
</P>
<P>
 He later found out what a couple of friends had done after they persuaded him 
to let them borrow his uniform for a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man, I even remember telling them, 'Don't do nothing dumb with it. It has my 
number on it,' " Cerna said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids will be kids. Rivals will be rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Let them play. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A footnote: Sylmar won the game, 69-6. Poly's points came on a 47-yard pass 
from Gamboa to Cerna three plays after the fight. In the end zone, Cerna 
recognized Cervantes standing near him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey man, where's my money?" Cerna said. 
</P>
<P>
 The comment cost Poly 15 yards on an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty.

HUISENGA PUTS CAL LUTHERAN OVER THE TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cal Lutheran football team found its way into the end zone just in time 
Saturday against Pomona-Pitzer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen trailed by 13 points before quarterback Ryan Huisenga threw two 
touchdown passes in a 4 1/2-minute span of the fourth quarter, then held on for 
a 17-16 Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference victory as 
Pomona kicker Brendan McDermott missed a 36-yard field-goal attempt with seven 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the rally, Cal Lutheran had moved the ball well but with little to show. 
The host Kingsmen marched into Pomona territory six times, including four 
drives inside the 30-yard line, but managed only three points. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran turned the ball over twice on downs, missed a field-goal attempt 
and tailback Terrence Thomas fumbled twice to end scoring threats.  
</P>
<P>
 But Thomas (168 yards in 32 carries) redeemed himself in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 With Cal Lutheran trailing, 16-3, and nine minutes to play, Huisenga faked a 
handoff to Thomas to draw in the defense, then found Steve Roussell in the end 
zone with a 31-yard pass to give the Kingsmen their first points since the 
opening quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were stopping ourselves the entire game," Thomas said. "We knew they would 
key in on me and we might get a big play." 
</P>
<P>
 After Pomona turned the ball over on downs, Huisenga (13 of 21 attempts for 
268 yards) connected with Thomas on a short pass that he turned into a 63-yard 
touchdown, eluding tacklers down the sideline. Dan Leffler's extra point with 4 
1/2 minutes left provided the margin of victory. 
</P>
<P>
 McDermott had a chance to win the game as Pomona drove 56 yards in 10 plays, 
highlighted by a 22-yard pass from freshman quarterback Jack Ramirez to Jonny 
Ulibarri. But McDermott, who earlier had missed a 34-yard attempt and made one 
of 35 yards, missed to the right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both teams had a reason to be down but both responded with a great effort," 
Cal Lutheran Coach Joe Harper said. "I have tremendous respect for the way 
Pomona played, since they were outmanned and they outplayed us for most of the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Of Pomona's 37 roster players only 31 suited up, but Ramirez kept Cal Lutheran 
(3-4, 2-3 in SCIAC play) off balance with an effective option play and a short 
passing attack.  
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez completed 18 of 32 for 184 yards and one touchdown. He also had 14 
carries for 90 yards. Senior tailback Robert Hicks gained 111 yards in 32 
attempts for the Sagehens (1-6, 0-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Although they moved the ball consistently, neither team scored a touchdown 
until late in the third quarter, when Ramirez connected with Ulibarri on a 
seven-yard pass play to break a 3-3 tie. Ulibarri finished with seven 
receptions for 61 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Kingsmen turned the ball over on downs, Ramirez set up a three-yard 
scoring run by Hicks with a 31-yard jaunt of his own. A bad snap on the 
extra-point attempt left Pomona with a 16-3 lead early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they went up by 13 it really sunk in on us," Huisenga said. "We were 
driving almost every possession but we kept having mental and physical errors. 
It sounds kind of bad but we still had a lot of confidence we could still win 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona had similar problems finishing drives early in the game. The Sagehens 
drove into Cal Lutheran territory three times in the first half before 
McDermott's field goal tied the score, 3-3, just before halftime.

TWO GOOSE; ANOTHER WING OF THE FIGHTING GOOSSEN FAMILY TAKES A SWING AT THE BIG 
TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He helped build a boxing business with his bare hands, investing hours of time 
and buckets of sweat only to take a hike right before his partners struck it 
rich. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning away at the wrong time can cost you. Boxing and gambling have that 
much in common. 
</P>
<P>
 You start pouring your savings into a slot machine, step away for a short 
break, and someone else saunters up and hits the jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Goossen has been there, done that. He knows the temptation of wanting to 
duck your head, tuck your tail and bail out for the duration. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet here Goossen is, strutting back into town, acting as confident as a poker 
player with an ace up his sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
 Just maybe that's exactly what he has. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Goossen never left the boxing game, he just regrouped. Now he's full-speed 
ahead again and look who's leading the charge: 
</P>
<P>
 His son. 
</P>
<P>
 P.J. Goossen is an unlikely looking warrior, lithe and a bit stoop-shouldered 
at 5-foot-10, 155 pounds with a shock of blond hair and a deep tan. 
</P>
<P>
 But he packs a punch -- and a resume. 
</P>
<P>
 P.J., 24, has a professional record of 12-0, with 11 of the victories by 
knockout. On Wednesday, he will box in his first main event, a 10-round 
superwelterweight bout against a veteran tough named Pat Lawlor in the Warner 
Center Marriott hotel's Grand Ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawlor has 20 victories and three of his five losses have come against 
champions Terry Norris, Hector Camacho and John David Jackson. He has defeated 
former title-holders Roberto Duran, Wilfred Benitez and Rene Arredondo. 
</P>
<P>
 One false move and P.J. might wish he was back stocking shelves as a drugstore 
clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat, 51, who trains and manages his son, has at least as much on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months ago, he and his wife, Mona, sold the family's home of 18 years in 
Valley Village. They used part of the equity to purchase a home in Palmdale. 
The rest will help finance a small stable of boxers for what Pat hopes will be 
a run at boxing fame and fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm gambling that there's going to be money from boxing coming in the next 
year," Pat said. 
</P>
<P>
 How's that for confidence? Pat didn't just bet the barn. He bet the whole 
farm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in him," Pat said of his son. "If I didn't, I wouldn't be working 
with him. He believes and I believe." 
</P>
<P>
 Money isn't the only thing at stake. So is family pride. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the early 1980s, Pat and a younger brother, Dan, organized a family 
boxing venture. Including brothers, sisters, their father, Al, and mother, Anna 
May, there were 10 Goossens. And so the Ten Goose Boxing Club was formed on a 
vacant lot in North Hollywood where a thousand family whiffleball games had 
been played. 
</P>
<P>
 From those humble beginnings emerged the First Family of San Fernando Valley 
boxing. In the mid-1980s, Ten Goose signed Michael Nunn, an Olympic alternate 
who climbed through the ranks to become the International Boxing Federation's 
middleweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten Goose rose with him -- an ascent made without Pat Goossen. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing philosophical differences with other family members, Pat, the only 
Goossen with any real previous boxing experience, walked away from the business 
just as Nunn was starting to bring the organization some recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? "For reasons it would take a paperback novel to explain," Pat said. 
</P>
<P>
 Suffice it to say that Pat feels he has been ostracized by certain members of 
his family. "There were no crusaders for me (in the Goossen family) once money 
started coming in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten Goose went out of business a little more than a year ago when Dan was 
hired as executive vice president of Top Rank Boxing. But by then the club 
already had risen to international prominence on the wings of Nunn's success 
and that of Gabriel and Rafael Ruelas, brothers who were trained and nurtured 
by another Goossen brother, Joe. 
</P>
<P>
 P.J. made his professional debut in May, 1992, on a Ten Goose-sponsored card 
at the Country Club in Reseda. However, Pat said, for the most part he and P.J. 
have been left to fend for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1991 Times story about the rise of Ten Goose mentioned only that Pat was a 
one-time boxer who was working as a Hollywood stuntman. Accounts in other 
newspapers and on television have focused on Dan as the founder -- a sore 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a bunch of baloney," P.J. said. "My father was the one who showed them 
how to throw punches, showed Joe how to do everything. He showed Dan the 
ropes." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan, 44, acknowledges Pat's contributions to Ten Goose, adding that he never 
considered his brother "split from the family." 
</P>
<P>
 It should be noted, however, that Dan isn't promoting Wednesday's card, nor 
has Joe offered to help in P.J.'s corner. Truth be told, it would not be out of 
the ordinary were both uncles to skip the bouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have any fighters on the card, so I really don't expect to see 
them," P.J. said. "But if they're there, I'll be happy. I still love my uncles. 
Outside of boxing, we get along well." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan said he will be there, just so long as travel arrangements that will take 
him to Las Vegas, site of the George Foreman-Michael Moorer title fight 
scheduled for Nov. 5, don't interfere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to Bob (Arum, president of Top Rank) about P.J. just the other day," 
Dan said. "This is the kind of fight that can catapult his career to the next 
level where we can look at him for our shows." 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers do agree on one thing. A victory over Lawlor would provide P.J.'s 
career with a big boost. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wins this and he'll be an item," said Pat, who trains P.J. at the Jet 
Center, just up the street from the old Ten Goose Gym in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dan: "It's the type of fight that separates the men from the boys. Lawlor 
is in the later stages of his career, but he's still a good barometer to find 
out where P.J. is." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lawlor fight is only P.J.'s fourth bout in more than a year, a 
circumstance he attributes to a lack of willing opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good fighters don't want to risk their record," P.J. said. "Bad fighters 
don't want to be suspended." As a medical precaution, the state athletic 
commission prohibits boxers who have been knocked out from returning to the 
ring for 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
 P.J. has more experience as a street fighter than he has in organized 
competition. He won seven of 10 decisions during a brief amateur career which 
he braved only as a necessary evil. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amateurs are for experience, but they weren't doing much for me," P.J. 
said. "I had more of a pro style. One of my punches make up for about four of 
somebody else's." 
</P>
<P>
 As a teen-age street brawler, P.J. spent 14 weeks of his adolescence in a 
juvenile detention center after a series of probationary infractions followed a 
conviction of assault and battery in connection with a fight at a skating rink. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, even in social settings, P.J. was a magnet for trouble. At a 
party three years ago, he suffered a potentially fatal wound when a man 
involved in a fight with someone else pulled a knife and stabbed him. 
</P>
<P>
 The knife was plunged 3 1/2 inches into P.J.'s chest, narrowly missing his 
heart and a lung. "They said a centimeter either way and . . . " P.J. said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ringside observers might notice the scar in the middle of P.J.'s chest that 
serves as a reminder of his tumultuous past. "Now I go to the movies with my 
wife, and that's about it," P.J. said. 
</P>
<P>
 That comes as good news for Pat, who had his own professional career cut short 
by injury. A recurring back problem forced his retirement at the age of 29. 
</P>
<P>
 The same congenital defect thwarted Pat's attempt at a law-enforcement career 
even before he started to box professionally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pass LAPD medical and this family probably would have been in a whole 
different direction," Pat said. "But I'm not sure the city would be any safer." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his professional boxing career, Pat said, he was "on automatic 
pilot." 
</P>
<P>
 His trainer liked to drink when he wasn't working as night janitor at a 
department store. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time he got to the gym with me he was so drunk he'd fall asleep," Pat 
said. "That was before they had the automatic bell. I would box sometimes what 
seemed like seven-, eight-, nine-minute rounds before I'd finally turn around 
and yell, "Bernie!" And he'd wake up from his stupor and yell, "Time!" 
</P>
<P>
 Pat's work as a trainer started in the late 1970s when a friend asked him to 
tutor young boxers in the Police Athletic League. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Ten Goose a few years later, Pat said, was "something we did to break 
the boredom of everyday life." 
</P>
<P>
 The club's original training facility was a makeshift platform built under a 
tree well within hydrocarbon-whiffing distance of the Ventura Freeway. Instead 
of rope, the Goossens used discarded garden hoses to form the "ring." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten Goose's first boxer was Harry (the Fighting Armenian) Kazanbjian, whose 
contract was bought from his former manager for $100. 
</P>
<P>
 "A great deal," Pat said. "Dan would have paid $200. (Kazanbjian's manager) 
wanted $50. They were both happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost a decade after leaving Ten Goose, Pat has his own group of boxers, 
including another of his six sons, 23-year-old Chuck; Chris Sande, a 1988 
Olympic bronze medalist from Kenya, and Rocky Pepeli, a heavyweight once 
managed by Dan. 
</P>
<P>
 They, too, are a part of the great gamble. But to a lesser extent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I'm living vicariously through my son," Pat said, referring to P.J. 
"But I would love to see him with a (championship) belt around his waist. It 
would almost be like me wearing it. What could be closer to you yourself doing 
something than to have your son do it?" 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership with his father serves as part of P.J.'s motivation. "I know 
my dad could make it on his own, but it would be a lot quicker if I helped out 
a little," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though his opponents haven't been much for quality -- anybody ever heard of 
Adolfo Gasca? Nelson Majia? -- 11 knockouts in 12 bouts would be a good ratio 
against cardboard cutouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very athletic and he can whack," Pat said of P.J. Dan agrees, proving 
the brothers still share an eye for talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if his nephew was a good boxer, Dan replied: "Sure. He's a Goossen. He's 
a fighter."

COMMENTARY; IT'S PAST TIME TO STOP DESTROYING CAREERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We destroyed Al Campanis' life because of some idiot remarks on "Nightline." 
We turned that name, Campanis, into a synonym for racism in sports, even though 
Al Campanis had done more for minorities in baseball than anyone since Branch 
Rickey. Jimmy (The Greek) Snyder was called "reprehensible" by his bosses at 
CBS and fired after talking in his rough, gambler's style about the physical 
traits of black athletes. Snyder lives out his days in ruin and obscurity 
because he did not use the right words. 
</P>
<P>
 Now we try to do the same job on Art Shell because of one word, alleged to 
have been spoken during a football game. The word is "white." 
</P>
<P>
 And that is not enough to damage an honorable football career and an honorable 
life. If that one word, white, placed before an obscenity in a sideline 
argument is enough to finish somebody, than we have become as vicious in the 
name of political correctness as people who use words that are much worse, such 
as ethnic pejoratives. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell, coach of the Raiders, got into a big shouting match with his 
quarterback, Jeff Hostetler. This was in a game against the Dolphins on Oct. 
16. A play was sent in to Hostetler from the sideline. Hostetler changed the 
play in the huddle. This was not an audible called at the line of scrimmage 
after the quarterback looked over the defense. This was the quarterback in a 
moment of insubordination. Now it is reported by Chris Mortensen of ESPN that 
Shell called Hostetler a "dumb white . . . " when Hostetler came out of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell and Hostetler both deny the story. I've known Chris Mortensen a long 
time and worked with him in newspapers once. He is a terrific, responsible 
reporter. He swears his story is true. Al Davis, the managing general partner 
of the Raiders, said last week, "I do not believe (Shell) said it." Davis said 
he has talked to everybody near Shell and Hostetler when the argument occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC, which broadcast the game, says it had only video of the incident, no 
sound. Some people in sports television have even hired lip readers to look at 
the footage. The lip readers say there is not much doubt that Shell used the 
word "mother -- -" for his quarterback, but they say he turns his head right 
before that, so no one can see him say "white." 
</P>
<P>
 But if he did, so what? 
</P>
<P>
 People say we must have the same rules for Shell that we had for Campanis and 
Snyder. If we do, does that mean we have to hand out the same sort of 
hanging-judge justice? Somewhere along the line, the people who fancy 
themselves the Thought Police have turned into cheap vigilantes. 
</P>
<P>
 You want to believe the ESPN story and you want to go after Shell and 
Hostetler then for covering the whole thing up, go ahead. Usually with 
something like this, the coverup is worse than the crime in the end. If it 
happened that way, it does not make Art Shell some kind of bum. It makes him 
human. Sometimes we prosecute being human in sports, sometimes not. A few weeks 
ago, Giants Stadium rocked with cheers for a recovering drug addict named 
Lawrence Taylor who once bragged in an autobiography about cheating on NFL drug 
tests. Some of these same people probably want to have Dwight Gooden deported 
because he seems to be the same kind of cocaine junkie. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Nicklaus was asked recently by a writer for a golf magazine why there 
aren't more blacks on the pro golf tour. Nicklaus gave his answer and talked 
about "different muscles that work in different ways." How different was that 
from what Jimmy the Greek said? Or don't these things count as much if they 
don't happen on television? 
</P>
<P>
 Do I believe Shell said these things? I do. I wish he had apologized and moved 
on. But maybe Shell learned more than we did from Al Campanis and Jimmy the 
Greek. Maybe he saw how little forgiveness there was for them, how little 
understanding, from the hanging judges of the tabloids and talk radio. So Shell 
decided to let it be his word against ESPN's. Then Hostetler went along with 
him. That is where we are, as far as we may ever get with this, unless somebody 
can produce the audio version of what we saw on the sideline at Joe Robbie 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 People act as if it is always a level playing field. They want to know what 
would happen if the same thing happened with a white coach, if he got caught 
using this kind of language. But it is never a level playing field. The word 
"white" will never be as loaded as "black." Because "white" has not been used 
as a synonym for "lazy" or "stupid" or "shiftless" for about 200 years. If it 
is such a level playing field, if the rules have to be exactly the same, how 
come it took so long for a black man like Shell to get a coaching job in the 
National Football League? 
</P>
<P>
 The same people who want Art Shell to play by the same rules as white folks 
now -- Shell probably wishes they were around in the '50s and '60s when he 
really needed them. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, there has to be a way for one angry moment, one word, not to suddenly 
obscure all the good in a man's life. Shell was born in 1946, in South 
Carolina. He went from there to an all-black school, Maryland State, to one of 
the great Hall of Fame careers in the history of pro football. He was a figure 
of dignity, respected by teammates and opponents. In 1989, Al Davis made him 
the first black coach in modern professional football. This was not Branch 
Rickey selecting Jackie Robinson for the Dodgers. But Davis picked Shell 
because he had seen the full measure of the man, as a player and then as a 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the same respect today that I have always had for Art Shell," Al Davis 
said Wednesday. "I have respect for him as a human being. I'm not just talking 
about his approach to football, but to his life. If I didn't think he was an 
outstanding man, he wouldn't have gotten this job in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 None of this means Shell is perfect, incapable of saying the wrong thing or 
doing the wrong thing. You cannot live nearly 50 years as an American black in 
the second half of the 20th century and not build up anger, crazy anger 
sometimes, about white America. Maybe some of it got away from him after his 
quarterback was insubordinate. He got mad, then I believe he said something 
stupid. Shell is not the first.

MURPHY IS STRONG AT THE FINISH TO KEEP SENIOR LEAD IN HAWAII 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Murphy overcame a slow start but had three birdies over the final four 
holes Saturday to hold off Jerry McGee for a one-stroke lead after two rounds 
of the Kaanapali Seniors Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, who shot a nine-under-par 62 on Friday, saw his four-stroke lead 
slowly erode as McGee, Jack Kiefer and Tom Wargo began blitzing the 6,590-yard 
Kaanapali North Course on the island of Maui. 
</P>
<P>
 At different times, McGee moved within a stroke of Murphy, and Kiefer and 
Wargo were within two. 
</P>
<P>
 But Murphy, after making the turn in one-under 34, had birdies on 15, 16 and 
18 for a 67 and two-round total of 13-under 129. 
</P>
<P>
 McGee finished with a 64, which put him alone in second at 130. Wargo matched 
the 64 to share third place with Kiefer at 131.  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have as good a rhythm today," Murphy said. "While the putts didn't 
go in, they rolled close. I didn't give away the day so I feel very good about 
tomorrow. It gives me a lot of confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 McGee made the biggest charge. He made a 40-foot putt for an eagle on 15 and 
birdies on the next two holes to put him in contention for the $82,500 first 
prize.

GLASSON STILL THE LEADER OF OLYMPIC PACK; GOLF: THERE ARE PLENTY OF PLAYERS 
CHASING HIM FOR $540,000 FIRST PRIZE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It's an all-out sprint to the bank today in the final round of the $3-million 
Tour Championship, where eight players are within three shots of the leader. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be Bill Glasson, the shaggy-haired flyboy who pilots his own plane 
and tinkers with his golf swing like some kind of mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at it this way. Somebody is going to scoop up $540,000 today, and 
Glasson, who is at eight-under-par 205, begins with one foot in the vault. 
</P>
<P>
 Glasson stayed in the lead with an even-par 71 Saturday at the Olympic Club, 
which wasn't so bad, but wasn't so great either. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides changing his swing, Glasson did something else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I let a lot of people back in the tournament," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pro golf's richest tournament is starting to look like a free-for-all. 
</P>
<P>
 One shot back of Glasson at 206 are Mark McCumber, who had a 69, and Fuzzy 
Zoeller, who had a 66. Ernie Els, who bogeyed the last hole, is in a group at 
207 with Brad Bryant and Steve Lowery. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Maggert, Corey Pavin and John Huston are next at 208. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a lot of people, and all of them are trying to win a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Glasson said he's not all that caught up in the money thing, at least as it 
relates to the golf thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money is just not all that important," he said. "I'm looking at this 
tournament as a building block for next year, maybe making a run at a major. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my goal for this week, to build on this performance. Hopefully it will 
be good. I hate to build on a bad performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, you can see why. But at the very least, it's probably going to be an 
entertaining experience, mainly because Glasson is going to be paired with 
Zoeller, a walking lounge act with a golf club. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoeller is within, well, joking distance of winning his first tournament of 
the year after four second-place finishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoeller said he has no clue if he's due or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know, but if you can look in your crystal ball and tell me, I won't 
come out tomorrow," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glasson, who has been paired with Zoeller before, hopes Fuzzy remembers his 
name this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always calls me Dick for some reason," Glasson said. "I don't know if he 
thinks my name is Richard or what." 
</P>
<P>
 Zoeller's round was as polished as his post-round monologue. His 20-foot 
birdie putt on No. 9 was his third birdie on the front nine and then he bagged 
two more coming in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a game," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a game he has been playing a long time. Zoeller joined the PGA Tour in 
1975 and is the 1979 Masters champion and the 1984 U.S. Open champion. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to beating the Olympic Club's Lake Course is that the greens break 
from the back to the front and that everything breaks toward the lake, Zoeller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the clues, he said, now figure out what to do with them. Only two 
things, after all. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got to remember where the lake is and where the front of the greens are," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoeller, 43 next month, has a reputation of enjoying the delights of neon 
lights and the 19th hole, which he said continues unabated. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone asked if he had changed his lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Zoeller said. "Want to go have a drink?" 
</P>
<P>
 Glasson's round was a quite an experience. He birdied No. 1, bogeyed No. 3, 
No. 4 and No. 6 when he missed all three greens, then birdied No. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 He rolled in a 20-foot birdie putt on No. 13 and a 10-footer on No. 15, but 
gave one shot back when he three-putted No. 16 for a bogey. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a struggle," said Glasson, who insisted there never was a question if 
he ought to change his swing, only what change to make. 
</P>
<P>
 The change Glasson made was in his setup, as in bending his knees slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 It's probably a good idea to practice it, so he is ready to pick up some money 
when the time comes. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoeller said it's a wonderful tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's the tour saying, 'Gentlemen, we appreciate your having a 
wonderful year, here is a little bonus for you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Zoeller said the money is not that big a deal to him anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me just say when I'm dead and gone and people are looking at you in 
there, you think those people are going to talk about the $500,000 or whatever 
it is you won? 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to come here and look at that trophy and see that name etched 
in there. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's history. The money's great, but getting your name on that trophy, 
that's our goal as players, putting our name on that history book." 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody remember who won last year? It was Jim Gallagher Jr.

 A new book about the Chicago Bulls says Scottie Pippen knew he was making a 
controversial decision when he decided to sit out the final 1.8 seconds of the 
third game of the 1994 Eastern Conference semifinals against the New York 
Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it as soon as I did it. I just didn't care." Pippen said in 
"Transition Game," a book by Chicago Tribune sports reporter Melissa Isaacson. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm put in that position again and I'm still considered the team leader, 
and we're down 2-0, I'm going to voice my opinion again." 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen said he was angry because Coach Phil Jackson wanted him to pass the 
ball in bounds to Toni Kukoc for a last-second shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was going through my mind is that I wanted to be there. Not to take the 
last shot, necessarily, but just to be an option," Pippen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All game long I'm being utilized offensively, and now we're taking a 
last-second shot and you're going to tell me to take the ball out." 
</P>
<P>
 Kukoc made the basket, and the Bulls won the game. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the book, Bill Cartwright, a 15-year NBA veteran, addressed the 
team with tears in his eyes after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scottie, I can't believe you would let us come so far, to bust our (tails), 
and then be so selfish," Cartwright said. "I've never seen anything like it. 
It's totally unacceptable."

 Boris Becker, formerly the world's No. 1-ranked player, played one of his best 
matches of the year in defeating top-ranked Pete Sampras, 6-4, 6-4, in the 
semifinals of the Stockholm Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker's victory on the fast carpet at the Globe Arena ended a four-match 
losing streak to Sampras dating to 1992. In their only previous match this 
year, Sampras won on clay in the Italian Open final. 
</P>

GOLF / THOMAS BONK; DALY SAYS HIS BACK WAS THE PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's no image like a good image, at least on the PGA Tour, which is one of 
the more intriguing aspects of the John Daly situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Tim Finchem told reporters at the Tour Championship that image is 
pretty important to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it is the most important charge of this office," Finchem said. "There 
isn't anything more important to this job than dealing with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Finchem announced that Daly had voluntarily withdrawn from PGA 
Tour events or sponsored events the rest of the year. Finchem implied Daly's 
action was a result of Daly's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly had been involved in a series of incidents, including a scuffle in a 
parking lot with the father of national club pro champion Jeff Roth, who 
accused Daly of hitting into his group at the World Series of Golf. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Daly said last week it was his decision, not Finchem's, to stop 
playing and that back problems were the reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was all my doing," Daly told Glenn Sheeley of the Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Tim, 'Look, I'm not going to play the rest of the year because of my 
back. . . . He (Finchem) said, 'That's fine. That's a very smart decision.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Daly told Sheeley, "It was just a voluntary withdrawal. . . . My back was 
killing me." 
</P>
<P>
 Finchem said he would not comment on Sheeley's story. But he did say he 
planned to talk to Daly about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said he thinks he hurt his back playing his guitar. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Get an interpreter: Nick Price, the money leader and sure winner of the PGA 
player-of-the-year award, has played the Tour Championship like someone needing 
some time off. 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympic Club isn't very friendly to a fatigued player. 
</P>
<P>
 "These greens are like trying to read Japanese," he said. "I can't read them 
for love or money." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Dirt and pay dirt: It might not rate much of a headline anywhere, but the 
Brad Bryant-Mark Brooks duel bears watching. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant, affectionately known on the Tour as Dr. Dirt, is No. 30 on the money 
list and needs to finish there to play in the Masters for the first time since 
he turned pro in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 There is only one player Bryant, 39, has to beat -- Brooks, who is No. 31 on 
the list and playing because Jose Maria Olazabal didn't play enough PGA Tour 
events to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant, six under after 54 holes, has a $6,818 lead on Brooks, who is even 
par. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Bill Glasson, who has had four knee operations, said he hurt his knees when he 
was a youngster playing basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Glasson: "Before I realized I wasn't going to be 6-10." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What size? Lee Trevino told Golf World that he still feels pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Trevino: "I still sweat. My guts are still grinding out there. Sometimes 
I have enough cotton in my mouth to knit a sweater." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Overheard: Steve Lowery hit a shot in his second round of the Tour 
Championship, the ball stopping on top of some television cables. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowery was awarded a drop. When he moved the cables, playing partner Mark 
McCumber ran over to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Said McCumber: "Are we in the union?" 
</P>
<P>

 Captive audience: There was sort of a media mix-up before the women's Solheim 
Cup last week when newspaper reporters and TV crews arrived at the Lewisburg, 
W.Va., airport to interview the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
 A 747 jet adorned with an American flag landed and the media got ready. 
However, the women who got off the plane were a group of convicts being 
transferred to the federal prison nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team arrived a few minutes later on a charter.

CROSS-COUNTRY / JOHNIE O INVITATIONAL; GLENDALE, MOORPARK QUALIFY FOR STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There comes a point in most cross-country races where each runner faces a 
dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 The mind is telling the body to push harder, but the body feels like it's 
already got pedal to metal and can't possibly go any faster. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Wilson of host Moorpark College found himself in that predicament at the 
three-mile mark of Saturday's Johnie O Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Newbury Park High standout was in fourth place -- and within 
striking distance of third-place Nazario Romero of San Diego Mesa -- but the 
fatigue in his legs won out over the determination in his mind in the final 
mile. He finished fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking to make a move," Wilson said. "I train on that part of the 
course a lot so I know what to expect, but I just didn't have much left. I was 
pretty tired at that point." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was Wilson's first in six races this season, but he didn't seem to 
mind, especially when he found out Moorpark had finished eighth in the team 
standings to qualify for next month's State championships in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 The top eight teams in the men's and women's races automatically advanced to 
the State meet. The ninth- through 14th-place teams stand a strong chance of 
qualifying, but their fate will not be determined until the six Southern 
California conferences hold their finals in the next week and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside, propelled by the 1-2-4-6 finish of Wilhelm Gidabuday, Aberrazak 
Merchoud, Cosmas Nguku and Cruz Gallegos, won the men's title with 76 points, 
followed by Mt. San Antonio (104), Glendale (117), San Diego Mesa (136) and El 
Camino (138). Moorpark totaled 302. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale, ranked first in the state, defeated Riverside, 45-52, in the Irvine 
Invitational three weeks ago, but two things tilted the rematch in the Tigers' 
favor. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, their fifth runner performed much better and secondly, 
Glendale's Jacques Sallberg is still not at full strength after a bout with the 
flu. 
</P>
<P>
 Sallberg was the Vaqueros' No. 1 runner at Irvine -- finishing sixth -- but he 
was the team's third scorer Saturday, placing 24th. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale didn't help itself by getting off to a slow start, either. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros got boxed in at the end of the quarter-mile-long straightaway at 
the start and had to work their way through the pack for the remainder of the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't get out well," Coach Eddie Lopez said. "That's something we need to 
work on. We can't afford to get a bad start like that at state." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to Glendale, Wilson had a good start. 
</P>
<P>
 He was among the leaders until shortly before the one-mile mark, when he 
dropped a couple of seconds behind Gidabuday, Merchoud, Gallegos and Romero. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not feel comfortable running (the first mile in 4 minutes 37 seconds)," 
Wilson said. "I'm not used to going out that fast so I backed off a little 
bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's strategy at that point was to stay close to the leaders and make a 
move later, but as the race progressed, Gidabuday, Merchoud and Romero began to 
extend their leads. 
</P>
<P>
 Gidabuday, the defending state champion in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters, blew 
the race open when he blasted up a steep hill nicknamed "Donner Pass" just 
before the three-mile mark. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished in 19:38 over a course that measured four miles, 70 yards. He was 
followed by Merchoud (20:05), Romero (20:12), Nguku (20:14) and Wilson (20:20). 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale was led by Nacho Delgado (21:12) and Jose Padilla (21:19), who 
finished 15th and 19th. 
</P>
<P>
 Sallberg (24th in 21:22), Eduardo Macias (26th in 21:27) and Jose Arias (33rd 
in 21:39) rounded out the Vaqueros' top five runners. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale's Tanya Janet was the region's top finisher in the women's race, 
placing 13th. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet had finished third behind Josephina Sanchez of Ventura and Heidi Tisovic 
of College of the Canyons in the second Western State Conference meet of the 
season Oct. 21, but she ran a well-paced race to finish well ahead of those two 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaquero sophomore timed 20:29 over the course that was 70 yards longer 
than 5,000 meters, cutting 70 places off last year's 83rd-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez placed 23rd in 20:59 to help Ventura finish seventh in the team 
standings with 264 points. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego Mesa placed first with 71 points, followed by El Camino (96), Citrus 
(147), defending State champion Irvine Valley (159) and Mt. SAC (209). 
</P>
<P>
 Canyons finished 10th in the team standings with 321 points, followed by 
Antelope Valley with 331. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Martin (20:47) and Joanna Potillo (20:57) placed 19th and 22nd for 
Antelope Valley. Tisovic (21:01) was 25th for Canyons.

THIRD TIME NOT THE CHARM FOR CAL LUTHERAN; SOCCER: KINGSMEN LOSE AGAIN TO 
CLAREMONT-MUDD IN SCIAC CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH, 4-1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DESMOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For three consecutive years Cal Lutheran has won the Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference West Division, 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble is, the Kingsmen have had to face East Division champion 
Claremont-Mudd for the SCIAC title. On Saturday powerful Claremont prevailed, 
4-1, marking the third time in a row the Kingsmen's championship aspirations 
were doused by the Stags. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was somewhat predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 Claremont-Mudd (15-2-1), which won its 10th match in a row, has now sat atop 
the final conference standings for 14 consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Claremont has tradition," Cal Lutheran Coach Dan Kuntz said. "And their 
players are big, strong, fast and very aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're the team this year from our conference and there's no doubt about 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Stag Coach Steve Davis had doubts whether Saturday's match-up deserved 
championship-game billing. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran (6-14) won the West with a 6-4 mark, which would have been no 
better than fourth in the East Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our minds, the real championship game was last week against (East 
runner-up) Pomona-Pitzer," said Davis, who will be notified today whether his 
eighth-ranked Stags will be awarded a home berth in next week's NCAA Division 
III West Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Claremont-Mudd also will anxiously chart the recovery of standout senior 
forward Patrick Gorgue, who was helped from the field in the 53rd minute after 
suffering a deep bruise to his right hip. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorgue scored his team-best 14th goal when he took a pass from Eric Wilson and 
headed it into an open net in the 17th minute. He added his 15th goal later in 
the half when he found the left corner of the net from about 50 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson added a goal late in the half and Claremont-Mudd entered intermission 
with a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman midfielder Edwin Astudillo scored Cal Lutheran's only goal, when he 
collected a rebound off Stag goalkeeper Travis Grant and knocked it home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen's comeback hopes were dashed in the 75th minute when Lui Cevallos 
took a nice breakaway pass from Ryan St. George and beat a defenseless Ryan 
Kaufman in net for a 4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Astudillo is one of 10 Cal Lutheran starters who will return next season. Cal 
Lutheran, which lost the title to Claremont-Mudd last season on penalty kicks, 
fielded a 1994 squad bereft of a returning starter.

PIERCE GETS OUTPOINTED ON ROAD BY HANCOCK, 52-43 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's fairly tough to win a game, Pierce College found out, if your defense 
allows 328 yards and 31 points in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The second half wasn't much better for the Brahmas, who allowed 541 yards in a 
52-43 Western State Conference Northern Division loss Saturday night to 
Hancock. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Etheridge, who rushed for 138 yards in 24 carries, and Tahki Bannister, 
who had 120 yards in 20 carries, found plenty of holes in the Pierce defense.

<P>
 Hancock quarterback Mick Sitarski completed 17 of 31 passes for 237 yards and 
four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce's Dave Muir threw for 352 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce (1-6, 1-5), which trailed, 31-22, at halftime, saw any possibilities 
evaporate when Sitarski connected with fullback Mark Diggs on a pair of 
third-quarter touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 52-29, in the fourth quarter, Muir picked apart Hancock's prevent 
defense for a pair of late-game touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Muir was Pierce's leading rusher with 16 carries for 30 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Etheridge, who ran for one touchdown, and Bannister, who had two, had a 
combined 195 rushing yards in the first half for Hancock (5-2, 4-2).

COLLEGE ROUNDUP; NORTHRIDGE WOMEN FINISH SECOND IN CROSS-COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jamie Whitmore, Cal State Northridge's No. 2 or No. 3 runner all season, led 
the Matadors to a second-place finish in the inaugural American West Conference 
cross-country championships at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitmore, a freshman from Sacramento Valley High, timed 19 minutes 2 seconds 
over the 5,000-meter course to help Northridge to a 40-point total. 
</P>
<P>
 Host San Luis Obispo, led by the 1-2-3 finish of Kerrie Flathers (18:17), Lori 
Fancon (18:35) and Angela Orefice (18:38), was first with 21 points. Southern 
Utah was third with 59. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Andrews (seventh in 19:11), Cheri-Lee Segal (eighth in 19:28) and 
Lori Miller (ninth in 19:41) added top-10 finishes for Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Godsey finished ninth in the men's race to lead the Matadors to a 
fourth-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Godsey timed 27:33 over the five-mile course as Northridge totaled 90 points. 
</P>
<P>
 San Luis Obispo, led by individual winner Coley Candaele (25:43), was first 
with 27 points, followed by Southern Utah with 53 and Cal State Sacramento with 
61. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference championships -- Jed 
Colvin and Jill Fuess were Cal Lutheran's top finishers in the meet at Prado 
Park in Chino. 
</P>
<P>
 Colvin placed 27th with a time of 28:04 over the five-mile men's course and 
Fuess ran 21:17 to finish 31st in the women's 5,000-meter race. Cal Lutheran 
placed eighth in both the men's and women's team standings. WOMEN'S SOCCER 
</P>
<P>
 Lara Heifner scored in the second overtime as Cal Lutheran defeated 
Pomona-Pitzer, 2-1, in the Regals' regular-season finale. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite winning their fourth consecutive Southern California Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference championship, the Regals are unlikely to land a berth in 
the NCAA Division III playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The playoff pairings will be announced tonight, but Cal Lutheran (14-5, 11-1 
in conference play) probably will be excluded because its record isn't quite 
good enough, according to Sports Information Director John Czimbal.

VENTURA DROPS THE BALL, 34-32 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Running back Damon Hill dropped a two-point conversion attempt with 42 seconds 
remaining, leaving Ventura College short in a valiant attempt to rally from a 
28-point deficit Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates were defeated by Santa Barbara, 34-32, in the Western State 
Conference North Division game. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura put together a furious rally in the fourth quarter, scoring three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Jason Bendinelli caught a three-yard touchdown pass to put 
Ventura in position for an attempt to tie. 
</P>
<P>
 On the conversion attempt, quarterback Jason Brown rolled right and found Hill 
wide open in the right corner of the end zone, but the pass was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Damon is on a special-unit team and he's the guy the ball is going to on that 
play," Ventura Coach George Rosales said. "The play was there." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara quarterback Jarrod DeGeorgia put on an aerial clinic against the 
Pirate defense in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 DeGeorgia threw four first-half touchdowns, staking Santa Barbara (3-4, 3-3 in 
conference play) to a 28-0 lead in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 DeGeorgia, the conference's second-ranked passer, finished 19 of 34 for 394 
yards and five touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura receiver Ivan McCrae combined with Brown on an 88-yard touchdown pass 
play to make the score 34-26 with just under three minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates (4-3, 3-2) recovered an onside kick and marched 60 yards for their 
final touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we went ahead and started to feel comfortable," DeGeorgia said. 
"They came back and made a big play against us." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura used two quarterbacks, Brown and Aaron Trianna, who combined for 262 
yards passing. Brown was 10 of 21 for 167 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 John Patton added 106 rushing yards in 18 carries.

PREP FOOTBALL; MISTAKES MAKE IT EASY FOR BISHOP AMAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK STRODER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mistakes against good teams are costly enough. But a mistake against La Puente 
Bishop Amat High this year is the equivalent of football suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Amat, ranked No. 1 by The Times, took advantage of five turnovers to 
defeat seventh-ranked Loyola, 20-7, Saturday night before an estimated crowd of 
10,000 at Glendale High. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Amat running back Daylon McCutcheon, who rushed for only 39 first-half 
yards, picked up 147 in the second half, including a 68-yard touchdown run, 
helping the Lancers improve to 8-0 overall and 3-0 in Del Rey League play. The 
Cubs fell to 5-2 and 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was frustrated early," said McCutcheon, who finished with 186 yards in 17 
carries, including another 68-yard run to set up a fourth-quarter field goal. 
"Our coaches kept telling me to settle for the five-yard gains and the big ones 
would come -- and that's what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola Coach Steve Grady had reason to be frustrated. Nearly every promising 
drive was thwarted by turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Amat's Ralph Brown was a particular thorn. The junior cornerback 
intercepted three of Loyola quarterback Kyle Spielbuehler's passes, including 
one at the Lancers' 15-yard line with 7:45 remaining and the Cubs trailing, 
17-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "The turnovers caught up with us," Grady said. "Without the turnovers and 
those two big runs, we played them even." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're by far the toughest defensive team we've played this year," Bishop 
Amat Coach Tom Salter said. "It was a great one for us to win." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers took a 7-0 first-quarter lead when quarterback James Free hooked 
up with Mark Verti on a 58-yard pass play. 
</P>
<P>
 After McCutcheon's 68-yard third-quarter burst put Bishop Amat ahead, 17-0, 
Loyola scored its only points on a 17-yard pass from Spielbuehler to Dan 
Farmer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs committed four first-half turnovers, the most costly being a fumble 
by Mike Vanis that was recovered by Bishop Amat's Booker Bell in the end zone 
for a touchback with 4:30 remaining in the half.

OLAJUWON TOO MUCH FOR CLIPPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clippers did their best against Hakeem Olajuwon in the first half Saturday 
night, holding him to four points.Olajuwon, however, scored 17 of his 21 points 
in the second half to lead the Houston Rockets to a 111-103 exhibition victory 
in front of 21,268 at the Sports Palace. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers led, 57-47, at halftime before Olajuwon rallied the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers took their last lead when Malik Sealy, who had a game-high 22 
points, hit a three-point shot with seven minutes to play to put the Clippers 
ahead, 92-91. A basket by Olajuwon then put the Rockets ahead for good, 93-92. 
</P>
<P>
 Elmore Spencer had 14 points and Tony Masssenburg 12 for the Clippers.

CAMPBELL, LYNCH, PEELER KEY IN LAKER SHAKE-UP; PRO BASKETBALL: DIVAC TO STAY AT 
CENTER, LYNCH WINS POWER FORWARD JOB AND ROOKIE JONES MIGHT GET OFF-GUARD SPOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That plan by the Lakers to switch Vlade Divac to power forward and Elden 
Campbell to center? 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Del Harris announced Saturday that not only will Divac stay in his 
familiar center spot, but that Campbell has lost his power forward job to 
George Lynch and will probably be coming off the bench when the regular season 
begins Friday at Detroit.In another possible shake-up from last season, Harris 
also said he is leaning toward rookie Eddie Jones in the opening lineup at 
shooting guard over Anthony Peeler, who started every game he played during an 
injury-plagued 1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
 The significant changes come after Peeler, bothered by a strained left 
(shooting) wrist, made only 33.3% of his attempts in the eight exhibition games 
and Campbell made another bad impression. They also come despite Jones having 
never played an NBA game that counted and Lynch, the former starting small 
forward, being only 6 feet 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Elden can play better than he's playing and play harder than he's 
playing," Harris said, adding that Campbell will still get minutes at center 
and with Divac. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the battle at shooting guard, Harris said: 
</P>
<P>
 "We think Anthony Peeler can play better than he's played, but he has been 
nursing a strained wrist, and it seems to be getting better now. . . . We know 
Anthony can shoot. The problem is sometimes when Anthony's shot isn't going 
well, it affects his defense and overall game. Then that's a real negative."

first of two charity baseball games pitting high school players and major 
leaguers against Southland college players. 
</P>

Blair Field in Long Beach to benefit Children of Promise, a Los Angeles

LA VERNE JUST MANAGES TO HALT CHAPMAN'S LAST-MINUTE BID FOR A VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chapman quarterback Curtis Robinson's pass was intercepted at the goal line 
with 50 seconds remaining as La Verne held on for a 36-33 nonconference victory 
over the Panthers Saturday at Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
 The way things were going, few would have figured this game would come down to 
a defensive play. With five second-half lead changes, one would expect the last 
team with the ball to win. 
</P>
<P>
 And with Robinson leading a drive from the Chapman 34 to the La Verne 17, the 
Panthers appeared to be in good shape. Earlier in the drive, Robinson nearly 
completed a 43-yard scoring pass to Terrance Green, but the pass was knocked 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 That might have been a sign of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
 On second and eight for the 17, Robinson rolled out and looked for Oscar Ford 
in the end zone, but defensive back Kurt Von Fossen picked it off. La Verne 
took over at the four-yard line and ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman, which looked overmatched in the first few minutes of the game, took 
the lead three times in the second half, only to have La Verne rally. The 
Leopards took the lead for good on a 10-yard run by Darren MacLellan with 3 
minutes 29 seconds left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played hard on defense," Chapman Coach Ken Visser said. "We may not have 
had great stats. We didn't always stop them when we needed to, but we played 
very hard." 
</P>
<P>
 That's small consolation for the Panthers (4-2-1) and cause for celebration 
for La Verne (7-0), which improved its chances of getting an NCAA Division III 
playoff bid. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was an emotional one for La Verne defensive lineman Tyrone 
Youngblood. Youngblood, an All-Southern Section selection at Marina High and 
All-Mission Conference at Orange Coast College, made an impressive return to 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Youngblood, a 6-foot-2 258-pound senior, sacked Robinson once early in the 
game and generally mucked up the Panthers first few series. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought after we scored I thought we were going to take it easily," 
Youngblood said. "But they sure gave us a game." 
</P>
<P>
 La Verne took leads of 7-0 and 14-7 with an offense that was on a roll. 
</P>
<P>
 After a short punt by Mario Acosta, the Leopards took over at the Chapman 39. 
Five plays later, quarterback Ryan Campuzano scored from six yards on a naked 
bootleg. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman even the score when Campuzano was sacked by Kenison Poching and 
Michael Simmons and Toney Eggleston picked up the fumble and ran 52 yards for a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 After La Verne went ahead 14-7, Chapman finally got its offense going. Ford 
gained 40 yards on a 54-yard drive and Darnell Morgan scored on a 14-yard 
screen play. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman took a 21-14 lead on its first possession of the second half when 
Aaron Meschuk finished a 49-yard drive with an eight-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 La Verne receiver Anthony Rice, drawing one-on-one coverage from Simmons, a 
linebacker, caught a touchdown pass from Campuzano to the score with 10:02 left 
in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman then scored again, taking 6:38 to drive 60 yards in 12 plays. Green 
scored on a four-yard lob from Robinson. Bill Hamlin missed his first extra 
point of the season, making it 27-21.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOOTBALL; O'BRIEN DIRECTS FULLERTON OFFENSE TO VICTORY OVER 
GOLDEN WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Quarterback Marc O'Brien threw three touchdown passes during a nearly perfect 
third quarter Saturday and Fullerton went on to a 35-14 victory over Golden 
West in a Mission Conference Central Division game at Titan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien, a sophomore, completed 10 of 11 passes, including the final eight in 
a row, for 154 yards in the third quarter. He finished the day 22 of 29 for 286 
yards and four touchdowns and did not play in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his passes was intercepted but that came after the ball caromed off a 
receiver's hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a career game today," Coach Gene Murphy said. "He made some wise, good 
decisions and he deserves everything he gets because he works so hard." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third consecutive victory for Fullerton (4-2-1) and the fourth in 
the last five games. Fullerton, the 10th-ranked team in Southern California, is 
tied for first in the Central Division with Rancho Santiago. The teams meet 
Nov. 12 at Titan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton led, 14-0, at the half and increased the lead to 21-0 when O'Brien 
completed a 14-yard scoring pass to Rani Kahouch with 9 minutes 46 seconds to 
go in the quarter. Kahouch had five catches for 66 yards in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien and Chris Johnson combined on a 30-yard scoring pass to make it 28-0 
with 5:58 left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien capped his performance with a swing pass to running back Michael Jacot 
that went 21 yards for a touchdown as the third quarter ended. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien's other touchdown pass went seven yards to wide receiver Steve Correa 
with 8:02 left in the first half. The play capped a 97-yard drive. Correa, who 
is the team leader with 33 catches for 461 yards, had six catches for 68 yards 
against Golden West. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's first touchdown was set up by a 38-yard punt return by Jimmy 
Sebreros that gave the Hornets a first down at the Golden West 29. Jacot capped 
the drive with a seven-yard run with 1:52 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's defense was equally impressive, keeping Golden West out of the end 
zone until the fourth quarter. It was the third consecutive game that the 
Fullerton has held an opponent to 19 or fewer points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rustlers (2-5-1, 2-2) scored on a 49-yard pass play from quarterback Brian 
Schneider to Damien Cook with 11:40 left in the game. The final touchdown came 
on a four-yard pass from reserve quarterback Dan Blahy to Bryan Gail with 6:40 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's about as complete as we've played this season," Murphy said.

MIKE PENNER: CS FULLERTON COACH JUST LIVES TO SELL THE MYSTERY OF SOCCER TO THE 
MASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The night belonged to Al Mistri, coach of the underfunded, underfed and 
underappreciated Cal State Fullerton soccer team that jumps up every so often 
and chomps the nation's No. 1 team -- Indiana, on this occasion -- right on the 
shin bone. 
</P>
<P>
 This was Mistri's not-ready-for-ESPN moment, but his moment nonetheless. It 
isn't often Fullerton beats the No. 1 team in the country in anything, so 
Mistri should have been pumping fists, slapping five, bouncing off walls, 
howling at the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he firmly shook the hand of the first sportswriter he saw and asked 
him, very earnestly, "So tell me, honestly, what did you think? Did you like 
it? Honestly now?" 
</P>
<P>
 Three-to-two overtime victory . . . winner scored on a penalty kick in the 
103rd minute with the fog rolling in . . . Fullerton plays short-handed for 
half an hour, overcoming two red cards, including one to goalkeeper Mike 
Kornock . . . Kornock is knocked silly on an outside-the-box collision that 
gets him thrown out of the game . . . backup goalie Justin Johnston comes off 
the bench to play his first minutes of the season and ride to the rescue . . . 
Martin Palos, a half-liter-sized freshman midfielder, spends a good portion of 
the night dribbling madly around and in between 10 Indiana redwoods . . . 
Johnston leaps high and to his right to punch away the potential game-tying 
goal in the 120th and final minute. 
</P>
<P>
 What's not to like? 
</P>
<P>
 "Really?" Mistri says, rocking back on his heels, initially unsure of what to 
make of such a response. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Mistri grins. 
</P>
<P>
 A happy customer. 
</P>
<P>
 One more. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri collects them like rare butterflies, relishing every find, taking care 
to note the date and location of each sighting. 
</P>
<P>
 For 14 years at Fullerton, Mistri has been trolling this way -- rolling his 
life's passion out there on abandoned football practice fields every autumn and 
seeing what the American people think. 
</P>
<P>
 If they stay the full 90 minutes, and refrain from test-landing paper 
airplanes on the midfield circle, Mistri calls it a good day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had 1,437 out here the other day to watch soccer," Mistri says, sounding 
as if he would like to toast the achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 "That may not sound like much, but for us, that's great." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Mistri's native Italy, AC Milan draws a bigger audience for preleague 
photo shoots. Mistri couldn't care less. He accepted his assignment long ago -- 
to help colonize soccer's last frontier, the gridiron-crazed States -- and has 
been on the clock long enough to remember days when four-figure crowds seemed 
like pie in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been blessed," he says, "to have seen everything here from just about 
the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember in 1964 juggling a basketball (with the feet) on the way to an 
Angel game. I was an exchange student, and I was juggling and punching the ball 
like most European kids would. My friends were looking at me like I was a 
weirdo. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was followed by 1967, when I had to go to Tijuana to buy soccer shoes 
because there was no one selling soccer shoes in the L.A. area. 
</P>
<P>
 "And, of course, in '71, I saw the beginnings of what is high school soccer 
today. During the same time, the under-19 level and the club scene took off. I 
played college ball from '67 to '70, at Cal Poly Pomona, and there were so few 
soccer teams that all of us were mixed together. Our schedule included both 
UCLA and Biola. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1981, I came here to Fullerton and people didn't even know where the 
uniforms were. That's a fact. To see it develop to where it is now, with 
college soccer having taken root and our program rumored to be fully funded for 
the first time, is a pretty significant thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri unabashedly predicts that soccer will "make it" as mainstream American 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will happen," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't be around to see it, but it will happen." 
</P>
<P>
 For argumentative support, Mistri cites two recent trends -- the growth of 
women's soccer and the financial constraints now tightening on college 
football. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women are the best allies soccer has," Mistri says. "The ones who are playing 
now are going to pass it down to their children and, I guarantee you, their 
children are going to learn the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The woman's influence in the family is significantly higher than what a man 
has, regardless. And the woman is not going to be gender-partial. She is going 
to push soccer to her sons and her daughters." 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri also believes that within 10 years, "only 60 to 70 schools will be 
playing Division I football." Other programs will be forced into economic 
extinction by the big-time powers, according to Mistri, "and when that happens, 
although begrudgingly, athletic administrators will turn to soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here is a sport that with 2,000 people in the stands can more than adequately 
pay for itself, and provide some pretty significant entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
 The soccer-for-football exchange isn't likely to gather much support in these 
parts, a notion that draws a quick nod and clarification from Mistri. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a way to supplant football," he says. "That is not the issue 
here. The issue is to have a number of significant institutions, like the 
University of Vermont, Santa Clara, Portland and Cal State Fullerton, saying, 
'OK, in the fall, we play soccer.' 
</P>
<P>
 "And that will provide the sport exactly what it needs, acceptance into 
mainstream of arrival." 
</P>
<P>
 Date of arrival? 
</P>
<P>
 Some time around 2024, give or take a half-decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "From 1964 to now is 30 years," Mistri says. "In that time we've gone from 
practically no existence to where we are right now. And right now, in the 
macrocosm of American sports, soccer is nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 But if Fullerton can beat Indiana on a wet field down a man, hey, anything 
just might be plausible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to hold my breath," says Mistri, Wilderness Pioneer, "and I'm 
not suggesting anyone does. But anyone who thinks this thing is dead is grossly 
mistaken. By a long, long shot."

 After Clayton's one-yard scoring run cut the lead to 28-21 in the third

 Rancho Santiago 30, Pasadena 21 -- The Dons (6-1) extended their winning 
streak to six consecutive in a Mission Conference game at the Santa Ana Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The key play of the game came in the third quarter with the Dons leading, 
10-6.After the Lancers (2-4-1) intercepted a Simon Fuentes pass on their 
39-yard line, they moved the ball to Rancho Santiago's 20-yard line. But then 
quarterback Joe Phears' pass was intercepted by linebacker Mike Fulton, who 
returned it 40 yards to Pasadena's 35-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 With the momentum on their side, the Dons moved the ball to the nine-yard line 
where Fuentes connected with wide receiver Jon Daniels in the corner of the end 
zone to put Rancho Santiago up, 17-6, with 22 seconds left in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Don defense came up strong on the next series, forcing a Lancer punt. 
After a 39-yard punt return by Roy Mendoza, the Dons gained 24 yards in two 
plays, capped off by a Ernest Wilson six-yard touchdown run with 13:45 
remaining in the game to take a 24-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson finished the game with 109 yards on 12 carries and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive back James Stewart halted another Lancer drive with an interception 
and 45 yard return to the Pasadena five-yard line. Three plays later, Kevin 
Pola scored on a one-yard run, giving the Dons a 30-6 lead with 10:55 left in 
the game.

PREP FOOTBALL ROUNDUP; CALVARY CHAPEL TAKES DEFENSIVE TO HOLD OFF ORANGE 
LUTHERAN 
</P>

<P>
 Don't hand the Olympic League championship to Orange Luthern just yet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers could have guaranteed themselves a playoff berth and eliminated 
Calvary Chapel from postseason play with a victory Saturday. But it was Calvary 
Chapel that was the better team on this night, taking a 21-14 victory at 
Brea-Olinda High. 
</P>
<P>
 Eagle running back David Kuhn ran for 106 yards and scored the winning 
touchdown on a 22-yard dash with 2 minutes 16 seconds left to play. Equally 
important was the 139 passing yards by quarterback Dallas Kruse, who was 
subbing for older brother Waylan. 
</P>
<P>
 But the deciding factor for Calvary Chapel (4-4, 1-2) was a stingy defense 
that contained the high-powered offense of Orange Lutheran (6-2, 2-1). The 
Eagles didn't completely stop Lancers running back Che Holloway, who rushed for 
139 yards and a touchdown, but they frustrated quarterback Joe Juliano, who 
completed only four of 18 passes for 59 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen points is the fewest scored by the Lancers this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got better offensive execution tonight," said Eagle Coach Kris Van Hook, 
whose team had scored only nine points the past two games. "And we got a great 
defensive effort. We didn't let them hit too many deep passes and we weren't 
shook up by all their formations." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Lutheran took a 6-0 lead on its first possession on a two-yard run by 
Matt Stratton. But when the Lancers missed a 34-yard field-goal attempt in the 
second quarter, the momentum began its swing toward Calvary Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 Kruse sneaked into the end zone from two yards with about four minutes left in 
the first half, and the extra point gave the Eagles a 7-6 lead. The margin 
became 14-6 in the third quarter when Calvary Chapel recovered a Holloway 
fumble at the Lancers' 28 and Kruse later found Alex Oakland free for a 
seven-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Holloway made up for his gaffe, however, scoring from four yards on Orange 
Lutheran's next possession. Holloway then tied the score on a two-point run.

CANYON'S JACOBS COULD MISS GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Canyon receiver Greg Jacobs could miss Thursday's Century League game against 
Villa Park because of an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs, the county's leading receiver, also was knocked unconscious and 
suffered a dislocated left shoulder in the third quarter of Friday night's 31-0 
victory over El Modena. 
</P>
<P>
 Comanche Coach Bob Hughes said the extent of the ankle injury probably will be 
known Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ankle might be the worst," Hughes said. "It's up in the air if there is a 
bone chip or not. It might be the bone on the outside of his foot. He could 
come back. We'll know a lot more on Monday."

 Cerritos Valley Christian 26, Whittier Christian 20 (tie-breaker) -- After 
Valley Christian quarterback Kirk Saarloos dashed 10 yards into the end zone to 
take a 6-0 lead in the tie-breaker, Jonathon De Bie intercepted a Garrett 
Estabrook pass to clinch a victory for the Crusaders at Whittier College. 
</P>
<P>
 The tie-breaker came as a result of a 20-yard touchdown pass to Keith Van 
Essen from Saarloos with 36 seconds left to play to tie the score, 20-20. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier Christian (5-3, 1-2) dominated most of the game, scoring on a 60-yard 
run by Jimmy Cuccia and a two-yard run by Nick Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Christian's only first-half score came on a five-yard touchdown run by 
Jason Wilkinson, set up by Mike Cunningham's 85-yard kickoff return. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heralds took a 20-7 lead when Valdez scored on a 27-yard run with 5:23 
left to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crusaders (7-1, 3-0) bounced back with a nine-yard touchdown run by 
Cunningham two minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 Three penalties forced the Heralds to punt and a 28-yard return by Cunningham 
brought Valley Christian to Whittier Christian's 31-yard line. The return set 
up Saarloos' pass to Van Essen five plays later. JASON HILL

<P>
 Irvine 21, El Toro 21 -- El Toro rallied for two touchdowns in the fourth 
quarter to earn a tie against Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers (4-3-1, 1-1-1) tied the score with two trick plays. 
</P>
<P>
 On fourth and 11 at the Irvine 25-yard line, quarterback Brian Wilson 
lateraled the ball to running back Merle Sango, who completed a pass to Joe 
Ader at the one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 On the next play, Wilson scored on a keeper to close the gap to 21-19 with 
7:22 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro tied the score with a two-point conversion. Wilson pitched the ball to 
Jamie Hanaway. Wilson then ran into the end zone and caught a pass from Hanaway 
to make it 21-21. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine (3-4-1, 1-1-1) had one last chance to win. On their next possession, 
the Vaqueros advanced 52 yards to the El Toro 14-yard line. But a 30-yard field 
goal by Sean Clark went wide right with 10 seconds remaining to end Irvine's 
bid for a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine was led by Russ Diehl, who scored on touchdown runs of three yards and 
one yard in the first half. He rushed for 161 yards in 33 carries. Wilson led 
El Toro, completing 13 of 24 passes for 150 yards.

PREP ROUNDUP; EL MODENA, ORANGE WIN CROSS-COUNTRY TITLES

<P>
 The El Modena girls' cross-country team, which features four freshmen, won the 
Century League finals Saturday at Yorba Linda Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
 In the boys' race, Orange, the county's top-ranked team, won its second 
consecutive title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vanguard girls, who finished 5-0 in the regular season, were led by senior 
Tara Whitfield, who was second, and freshman Jessica Dahlberg, who was third. 
Both finished in 17 minutes 56 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 El Modena finished with 28 points. Foothill (54) was second and Santa Ana 
Valley (63) was third. 
</P>
<P>
 El Modena, ranked seventh in the county, competed in several meets early this 
season, including an invitational in New York. The experience paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Elly Estrada of Santa Ana Valley ran away with the individual 
championship in a meet-record 17:30, bettering the mark of 17:32 by Canyon's 
Kim Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to decide to go or not at (the halfway point)," Estrada said. 
"It was tough by myself. Coach (George) Payan says I'm a leader and if I'm 
going to win, I have to go out and lead the whole race." 
</P>
<P>
 At the halfway point, El Modena looked to have control with runners in the 
Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our plan was to have four in the top six," said El Modena Coach Tom Weber. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys' meet was decided by experience and the advice of Coach Ed Cantu, who 
told his runners to be "patient" and that "you don't win a meet in the first 
mile." 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers seemed to trail throughout the race and appeared as if they would 
finish in third with a little over half a mile to go. But Orange made up at 
least 11 places between three runners before the finish line to win with 35 
points. Santa Ana Valley (49) was second and El Modena (55) third. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers were led by league champion Glen Busch. Busch, a senior, ran a 
personal best of 14:58. 
</P>
<P>
 The top three teams in both boys and girls advance to the Southern Section 
Preliminaries at Mt. San Antonio College on Nov. 12. Teams not finishing among 
the top three have the opportunity to be accepted as a wildcard, since 
cross-country playoffs are run on an enrollment basis. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Golden West League: 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana Saints easily defeated Saddleback, 37-63, for their fourth 
consecutive league title and sixth in the last seven years. The Saints come 
into the newly found league from the Sunset League and were led by Danny Revero 
and Wencelslado Morales, finishing third and fourth respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Taryn Lawson and Kenna Masuda ran to a one-two finish to lead Ocean View to 
the league championship, narrowly edging Saddleback, 41-44. Lawson and Masuda 
ran 19:02 and 19:14 as Gaby Martinez of Saddleback placed third in 19:16. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View senior Eric Wersching used his track speed to come from behind and 
win the boys' league title and advance to the section preliminaries. Morales 
led up to the two-mile mark when Omar Cordero of Saddleback and Wersching 
passed him. With about 200 yards to go, Wersching started into a full kick and 
passed Cordero, winning in 15:36 over the hilly three-mile course at Central 
Park in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The top three teams, along with the top three individuals, qualify for the 
section preliminaries.  
</P>
<P>
 Other individuals to qualify were Lisa Ritter of Westminster, Wersching and 
and Servite's OC Frank. DON EARLE TURNBULL

COOL DAY MAKES FOR HOT TIMES AT POMONA; DRAG RACING: SHELLY ANDERSON SETS 
TOP-FUEL ELAPSED-TIME RECORD, THEN WINS $50,000 BONUS. FORCE GETS FUNNY CAR 
MARKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Drag racers like to theorize about the optimum conditions for breaking speed 
barriers for a quarter-mile from a standing start. 
</P>
<P>
 Overcast skies and a windless day, temperatures in the 70s, the right 
barometric pressure and a cool, slightly tacky track are almost as important as 
a 5,000-horsepower engine and the proper mix of nitromethene. 
</P>
<P>
 They were all in place Saturday at the Pomona Fairplex strip for the final 
rounds of qualifying for the 30th Winston Select Finals. The result was one of 
the greatest displays of speed on a single day in National Hot Rod Assn. 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Shelly Anderson, who grew up in a racing family a few miles from Pomona in 
Covina, recorded the quickest top-fuel run ever, 4.718 seconds, and backed it 
up with a 4.741 later in the day to claim the official NHRA elapsed time 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson came back still later to run another 4.71 in the Budweiser Classic 
finals against Cory McClenathan, which earned her family-owned team a $50,000 
bonus. If no one betters her elapsed-time record in today's eliminations, she 
will collect another $50,000 from the Slick 50 World Record Club. 
</P>
<P>
 -- John Force, a four-time NHRA funny car champion from Yorba Linda, ran 
302.82 m.p.h. in his Chevrolet Lumina funny car for another national record. 
Force, already winner of the $150,000 Winston bonus as the 1994 champion, also 
set a track elapsed-time record of 4.973 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The 16-car top-fuel field, from Anderson's 4.718 to No. 16 Scott Kalitta's 
4.887, is the fastest in NHRA history. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Along the way, Kenny Bernstein ran 307.06 m.p.h., the fastest top-fuel 
speed ever at Pomona; Warren Johnson continued his hot streak at Pomona, 
setting pro stock track records of 7.041 seconds and 196.54 m.p.h. in his 
Oldsmobile Cutlass; and David Schultz rode his Suzuki motorcycle to a 
track-record 7.589 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't me, it was the car," Anderson said after accepting congratulations 
from her father, Brad, a former NHRA top-alcohol champion. "Now, I've got to go 
out Sunday and do my job." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson is No. 1 qualifier for today's final eliminations, which start at 
10:30 a.m. She will meet Kalitta, the newly crowned NHRA champion, in the first 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson had it easy in the Budweiser Classic finals when McClenathan did not 
get off the starting line, but she earned her victory in the second round when 
she needed her 4.741 to catch and pass Eddie Hill. Hill ran 4.821 after beating 
her off the starting line. 
</P>
<P>
 "The race was so close I didn't know who won," Hill said, "but when I saw the 
television cameras head to Shelly's car, I knew it was over for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's margin was five-thousandths of a second. At the 1,000-foot mark, 
Hill was ahead by .028 when two cylinders misfired on his Pennzoil dragster. 
</P>
<P>
 The final was anticlimactic as McClenathan's car had a supercharger 
malfunction at the start. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an odd feeling to hit the throttle and just sit there with the car not 
moving," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said she did not know that McClenathan did not start. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was busy watching the lights and I couldn't see him," she said. "I was just 
hoping he wouldn't drive around me. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time Anderson, who won the Winternationals at Pomona last 
February, had ever been No. 1 qualifier. She also became the first female 
winner of the Budweiser Classic, accomplishing in her first outing what Shirley 
Muldowney and Lori Johns had failed to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's first-round victory over Don Prudhomme gave her special 
satisfaction, as Prudhomme had beaten her three times this year in first-round 
matches. Prudhomme did a mini-wheelie coming off the starting line and was no 
match for Anderson's perfect start. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw his front end come up and it made me feel good," she said. "Anytime I 
beat him it's really something special. He's so fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
 Prudhomme, who will make the final runs of a 31-year career today, qualified 
fourth at 4.774, behind Anderson, Blaine Johnson (4.751) and Bernstein (4.754). 
 
</P>
<P>
 It was not a good day for Kalitta. In the first round of the Budweiser 
Classic, he broke the throttle linkage during a pre-race burnout and did not 
start. In his second qualifying attempt, he smoked his tires off the line and 
had to sweat out making the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalitta's time of 4.887, made Thursday, was vulnerable when Arley Langlo of 
Goleta made the final top-fuel run of the day, but Kalitta survived when 
Langlo's dragster erupted in flames from an oil fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who has won the last four pro stock events at Pomona, said his record 
time surprised him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The car ran some good numbers in third gear, but there are some bumps on the 
top end of the track that get the car really bouncing around in fourth and 
fifth gears," the 50-year-old driver said. "Everyone else who ran fast times 
was in the same lane. We were just a little luckier than the rest." 
</P>
<P>
 In the battle for the pro stock championship and its $100,000 bonus, former 
champion Darrell Alderman needs to finish no more than two rounds behind 
teammate Scott Geoffrion to win. Alderman qualified second and Geoffrion fourth 
in their Wayne County Dodge Avengers. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's most spectacular incident occurred when pro stock driver Ed Hack's 
Trans Am became airborne and did a half-gainer before coming down on its roof. 
The car clipped the left wall and slid on its roof across the finish line with 
sparks flying from the roll cage. Heck climbed out uninjured.

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: YOUR MONEY; STOCK PICKING WITH SOPHISTICATED 
SOFTWARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, He is a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, specializes 
in mutual funds.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine you had 4,000 securities analysts at your command, sifting through 
investment information around the clock in hope of finding the best stocks at 
the cheapest prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Further suppose that you didn't have to pay these analysts, let alone 
supervise them, feed them or allow them any coffee breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Barr doesn't have an army of 4,000 human analysts, but he speaks like he 
does. He manages a new small-stock mutual fund using a "neural network" 
computer programming model, an approach he says gives him the power of 4,000 
analysts. 
</P>
<P>
 Barr manages the new Quantitative Disciplined Growth Fund, part of the 
Quantitative Group, a small fund family headquartered in Lincoln, Mass. Barr's 
portfolio debuted in October and counts only about $1 million in assets so far. 
It will focus on finding inefficiently priced small stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing especially novel about fund managers using computers to aid in 
their research. Investors have been using PCs for years to screen thousands of 
stocks for those showing high earnings growth, low book values, insider trading 
and all sorts of other variables. 
</P>
<P>
 But neural-network modeling is different in that it is adaptive. Barr has 
programmed his computer to identify those factors that are making individual 
stocks move at any given moment. As market conditions change, so do the 
dominant investment factors. 
</P>
<P>
 "No single indicator works 100% of the time," notes Barr. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the computer is able to make evaluations after considering all sorts 
of information simultaneously -- much like the human decision-making process. 
Computers are adept at performing trial-and-error calculations on a massive 
scale to discern subtle patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 The neural-network approach has already been applied in medicine, finance and 
other fields where pattern recognition is sought using information that appears 
random to the human eye or mind. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, neural networks have shown promise in spotting credit cards that 
have been stolen but not yet reported lost because the owners don't realize 
they're missing, Barr says. Before making large purchases on a stolen card, 
thieves tend to make small purchases on automatic-payment machines such as 
those at gas stations. These small purchases are an anonymous way for a thief 
to check whether the card has been canceled. The pattern of large and small 
transactions, along with other details, shows up in a pattern a computer can 
recognize. 
</P>
<P>
 Neural-network modeling is also making a name in the investment sphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Barr's firm, LBS Capital Management of Clearwater, Fla., has been managing 
money with a neural-network slant for large institutional clients since 1988 
and now counts $700 million in assets. The company's alliance with the 
Quantitative Group marks its first foray into mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Lewis at Fidelity Investments of Boston is the groundbreaker here. He 
runs three mutual funds -- Disciplined Equity, Small-Cap Stock and Stock 
Selector -- with a neural-network approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis inputs about 100 variables in his ever-changing model, with an emphasis 
on earnings. He has beaten the Standard & Poor's 500 in each of the past five 
years and is running roughly in line with the market so far in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Barr says he focuses more closely on "bottoms-up" or company-specific 
information compared to Lewis, who tracks broad industry, market and economic 
patterns in addition to data on individual stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The time may be ripe for further applications of neural-network programming in 
the investment sphere, for two reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The first involves great advances in computing power, which have made today's 
PCs as powerful as mainframes were several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The second involves the explosion of investment information in magazines, 
newspapers, financial broadcasts, research reports, studies and more. This is 
too much information for most stock pickers to handle, Barr believes. 
Neural-network models are able to cut through the chaff to get to the wheat. 
</P>
<P>
 But investors intrigued by this approach should realize that a computer's 
pattern-recognition and predictive abilities depend on how well it is 
programmed and monitored by humans -- the old "garbage in, garbage out" 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 It's particularly challenging to assign proper weights to the various 
investment variables so the neural-network model concentrates on the most 
important factors while minimizing others. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Quantitative Disciplined Growth, investors should be aware of 
some additional risks: 
</P>
<P>
 * The fund invests in smaller companies, which are prone to bigger price 
swings than the blue chips. This danger also applies to Fidelity Small-Cap 
Stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quantitative Disciplined Growth is a new portfolio run by a management team 
with no performance track record in the mutual fund arena. 
</P>
<P>
 * The fund is able to sell stocks short, a risky strategy that bets on falling 
stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
 * The fund's per-share expenses are expected to be fairly high, in the range 
of about 2.1% annually, including a 0.5% 12b-1 marketing fee. That compares to 
an average of about 1.4% for stock funds. Lewis' funds also had high pro-rata 
expenses early on, but they have come down as the portfolios gained assets and 
became more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Quantitative Disciplined Growth ((800) 331-1244) carries a 1% back-end sales 
charge. No-load shares are available for institutional investors. Fidelity 
((800) 544-8888) levies a 3% load on Small-Cap Stock but no sales charge on the 
other two portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
 Barr predicts neural networks will gain greater acceptance in the investment 
community, though he believes there will always be a place for managers with 
top intuitive stock-picking skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still don't think a computer can out-trade a human being," he says.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: TO AVOID TAX, SELL SHARES CAREFULLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. I began investing in Southern California Edison in 1973 and enrolled in its 
dividend reinvestment program in 1982 at ever-increasing share prices. Overall, 
I have a nice capital gain on my purchases, but about a third of the shares 
were bought at prices higher than the stock's current trading value. I want to 
sell this portion of the stock and take a capital loss. I have assigned 
specific certificates to the various shares. Will my plan pass muster with the 
Internal Revenue Service? -- E.Z . 
</P>
<P>
 A. If you can readily identify each block of stock you own and are prepared to 
deliver those certificates at the time you sell the shares, you should have no 
problem with the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, the IRS takes the position that unless you can precisely identify 
the shares you are selling, you are deemed to be selling the first ones you 
purchased. This is the "first in, first out," or FIFO, method of accounting. 
However, if you can deliver the certificate for the stock you want to sell or 
can get your broker to produce a statement of purchase verifying that you are 
selling shares bought on a certain date, you can sell whatever shares you want. 
A Rule of Thumb for Age and Investments 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I am retired, single and can't afford to lose my investment principal. I 
have two annuities, some life insurance and a bank account. I have invested in 
first trust deeds with an established mortgage lending firm and that gives me a 
steady income. Does my plan make sense? -- S.Q . 
</P>
<P>
 A. For starters, why do you, a single person, have life insurance? Do you have 
dependents or heirs for whom you want to provide? Absent significant 
beneficiaries, you may want to reconsider the wisdom of maintaining the policy, 
especially if it requires a large outlay on your part. 
</P>
<P>
 You may also want to evaluate the percentage of your portfolio invested in 
trust deeds. By far, this is the riskiest part of your portfolio, and if you 
pay attention to the news at all, you are surely aware of the large number of 
scams law enforcement officials have discovered in this industry, particularly 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, your goal should be to hold a diversified investment portfolio that 
is appropriate to your age. Some personal finance advisers recommend that one's 
age should match the percentage of the portfolio that is invested in safe, 
stable holdings such as cash, bonds and fixed-rate annuities, and the remainder 
should be in equities and other, equally volatile instruments. Mutual Fund 
Choice -- Too Conservative? 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I have been retired for nine months. My home and car are paid off and my 
wife and I are able to live easily on my pension and Social Security benefits. 
I have rolled my 401(k) funds into an IRA that is invested in two mutual funds, 
Sierra and Vanguard Winsor II. Have I done the right thing? -- D.B . 
</P>
<P>
 A. Unfortunately, you haven't provided enough information about your financial 
status or the specific funds you are enrolled in to permit a full answer. 
Perhaps some general comments would be useful. 
</P>
<P>
 We can't comment on your Sierra investment because you haven't said which of 
its many funds you joined. Vanguard's Winsor II is generally regarded as a 
stable, if not spectacular, fund run by a respected and trusted company. It is, 
however, a conservatively invested growth and income fund whose performance has 
lagged the industry this year. According to industry statistics, Winsor II has 
grown 0.84% in the first three quarters of 1994, while the respected Lipper 
Index of Growth and Income Funds places the industry average at a 1.24% 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
 You may want to reduce the amount of money you have in your emergency fund. 
Since you are retired and receiving a pension and Social Security, you are not 
in any danger of losing your income stream.  
</P>
<P>
 As to the allocation of your investments, the maxim offered to the reader 
above holds true for you as well: Consider your numerical age as a guide to the 
percentage of your portfolio that should be invested in safe, stable 
investments, with the remainder in equities and equally volatile instruments. 
Putting a Trust's Idle Cash to Work 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I manage a small trust that currently has about $30,000, or 10% of its 
total value, in cash. I would like to put a substantial amount of that in a 
conservative income fund with some growth potential. Any recommendations? -- 
J.W . 
</P>
<P>
 A. With interest rates volatile and on the rise, our experts say now may not 
be the right time to invest in income funds, which are basically just bond 
mutual funds. If you are determined to get into this market, you should enter 
it slowly and incrementally with a "dollar cost averaging" strategy. Under this 
method of buying, you space out your purchases over months, and preferably 
years, to minimize exposure to any single market condition.  
</P>
<P>
 Funds to consider, says Margie Mullen, a Los Angeles investment adviser, 
include Benham Prime Money Market Fund and Vanguard Wellesley.

TRAVEL INSIDER: YOUR RESERVATION ABSOLUTELY ASSURES YOU A ROOM, SORT OF; 
LODGING: OVERBOOKED HOTELS RESERVE THE RIGHT TO 'WALK' YOU ELSEWHERE FOR THE 
NIGHT, AT THEIR EXPENSE. CHECK BEFORE YOU GO. 
</P>

<P>
 What does it mean when a hotel offers you a chance to "guarantee" or "assure" 
your room by giving your credit card number in advance? Most travelers presume 
it means a room in the hotel will be held in their names, no matter what. After 
all, the vast majority of reservations do work out that way. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all. Overrun on a convention week or otherwise caught off guard, most 
hotels overbook now and then, and end up telling guests that their "guaranteed" 
rooms have been given to someone else. To placate guests at such times, 
industry insiders say, most hotels have settled on a common make-good strategy: 
Find the inconvenienced guest a room elsewhere, and cover the cost of his first 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, as my friend Steve discovered last month, a traveler without 
that specialized knowledge runs the risk of getting the short end of the stick. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut now to the Hotel Triton in San Francisco, on the evening of Sept. 22. 
Facing a one-night business trip to the city and having heard good things about 
the playful design and convenient location of the Triton, Steve had booked a 
room there through a local reservation agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea behind guaranteeing a room is appealing: You give your credit card 
number to assure payment whether you show up that night or not, and in exchange 
you have the freedom to arrive any time after the lodging's usual 4 p.m. or 6 
p.m. check-in hour. 
</P>
<P>
 If you reserve a room without using a credit card number and don't show up by 
early evening, the hotel understandably feels free to give the room to someone 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel agents say virtually all business travelers and most leisure travelers 
give their credit card numbers in advance these days. 
</P>
<P>
 In Steve's case, the arrangement was made more than a week in advance; he gave 
his American Express number; he received paperwork and a confirmation number in 
the mail. But when he got to the hotel counter, the clerk told him there was no 
room for him. 
</P>
<P>
 What, asked Steve, about his confirmation number and his piece of paper? No 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 Had his reservation been lost? No. There was just no room. 
</P>
<P>
 The clerk eventually explained that another guest had decided to extend his 
stay, thus occupying the room that would have been Steve's. Then the clerk told 
him a fall-back room had been reserved for him a few blocks away at the Sir 
Francis Drake -- a comparably priced property run by the same management as the 
Triton, the Kimpton Group, but a much less interesting place. For his trouble, 
the Drake gave Steve a free night's parking. Value: $23. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why," asked Steve, "should I have to pay for someone else's decision to stay 
another night?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the hotel trade, this is known as "walking" a guest. Hotel officials say 
the process is rare (so rare, several spokespersons claimed, that they have no 
statistics on how often it happens) and undesirable. But it's common enough, 
especially during big conventions, to have a universally recognized nickname, 
and to be specifically provided for in the policies of major credit cards and 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth F. Hine, president and chief executive officer of the Washington-based 
American Hotel & Motel Assn., said that "if a credit card is used to guarantee 
a reservation, then guests have every reason to expect that there will be a 
room waiting for them when they arrive." If there isn't, Hine says, the 
"generally prevalent industry practice" is that the hotel pays for the 
traveler's first night in comparable alternative accommodations, and also for 
transportation to the new property and a phone call to family or business to 
pass word of the unexpected change in lodgings. (There are minor variations 
from chain to chain; Hilton's "dishonored reservations" policy, for instance, 
allows as many phone calls as are necessary to alert family and business 
associates of the change in address.) That practice "has evolved company by 
company," Hine said, and dates back at least 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 That informal custom runs essentially parallel with American Express' "assured 
reservations" program, which company officials say is more than a decade old 
and includes a substantial majority of the major hotels in the United States. 
That program, officials said, requires member hotels to offer a free night's 
lodging, transportation and phone call when guests with AmEx-reserved rooms are 
forced into another hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Visa has a program for card-holders, too, but doesn't mandate a free night's 
stay.  
</P>
<P>
 If you want to be clear where a hotel stands, it's probably best to ask the 
question directly in advance: What happens if you have to walk me to another 
hotel?  
</P>
<P>
 So what, then, is the Triton policy? Kimpton Group spokeswoman Merideth Post 
reports that all 13 Kimpton hotels in San Francisco do in fact have a policy of 
giving a free night to guests who are walked to alternative hotels. 
Unfortunately, she said, Steve encountered a clerk who misunderstood the 
policy. Now the clerk understands, Post said, and Steve has a free hotel night 
waiting the next time he's in San Francisco.

WEEKEND ESCAPE: MORRO BAY; BARGAIN BAY WATCH; A COUPLE WITH AN APPETITE FOR 
LOAFING FINDS A SEASIDE TOWN WITH JUST THE RIGHT INGREDIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, TIMES STAFF WRITER; Wride writes for The Times' Orange County 
edition. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was about a month before our real vacation when cabin fever set in. 
Restless after homebound months of saving for our Europe trip, my boyfriend and 
I realized we needed a cheap getaway. Heavy on the cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Looking within a four-hour drive from home, we quickly agreed on Morro Bay: 
It's easy to do over a three-day weekend and a beautiful trip getting there. 
The geography and attitude are more Northern than Southern California, so we 
would feel even farther away. 
</P>
<P>
 No cellular phones at the Young's Giant Food supermarket. No beeping watches 
or pagers intruding on dinner at the local fish house. Had the forecast not 
called for storms, we would have camped at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, we arrived in a late spring downpour to our modest 1960s stucco motel 
-- the Sundown -- a block from the Embarcadero and the Morro Bay Rock. The good 
news: The cozy bed was wired with Magic Fingers and the curtains were not 
vinyl. For $65 a night -- $35 on Sunday -- and vaulted ceilings, it was the 
cat's pajamas. (Winter rates: $48 and $35.) 
</P>
<P>
 In this naturally cute town, we were expecting beauty and affordability. But 
as scavengers of goofball salt and pepper shakers, we also hit pay dirt: more 
square footage of kitsch than a Miami Beach garage sale. On one side of the 
street was the turquoise Aquarium with barking sea lions and gift shop below 
with vintage shakers (we bought the mustard-yellow sea mussels set); on the 
opposite corner of the town's main drag was a shop with shell toilet seat 
covers and lamp fixtures. Maybe we wouldn't need to stop off at Santa Claus 
Lane after all. But we digress. 
</P>
<P>
 A lazy Saturday start from Long Beach led us to Santa Barbara by midday. We 
broke up the four-hour drive with sandwiches at an oceanfront cafe for locals 
called the Brown Pelican. Hidden off the beaten path below Hope Ranch, it was 
my favorite place when my dad lived a mile down the road. I hesitate mentioning 
it for fear of crowding the place up, but I suppose this is meant to share 
swell spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Dogs are allowed on the beach with people and you will find all breeds of 
both, from polo shirt guys taking meetings to surfers and college students from 
UC Santa Barbara a few miles to the north. Great people watching, and during 
peak season you can lie on the sand all day and watch wind sailers glide down 
off the mountains just inland. We lucked out and beat the storm, eating 
outdoors in breezy sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours and Was Not Was tapes later, our lovely drive along Kelly green 
hills and stormy gray ocean delivered us to funky Morro Bay. Our motel was 
newly painted pink and had a white rock garden to match, but we were relieved 
to find the room clean and the television reception of the NBA play-off games 
perfect. That and a working ice machine -- we're pretty easy to please. 
</P>
<P>
 When the sky cleared, it was about time to head up the coast a half an hour to 
San Simeon, where we took the evening tour of William Randolph Hearst's 
extraordinary hilltop estate -- a combo of the other tours and, therefore, a 
relative bargain. But first, a quick dinner in town. No frills, no fuss style 
is what you get at the Whale's Tail, where diners order before they are seated. 
Red snapper, the chowder and salads were terrific and we were out in 30 minutes 
for under $20.  
</P>
<P>
 It's more gorgeous coastline on the drive north, and sunset at Hearst Castle 
is spectacular. But after-sundown is what I liked most. Suddenly this 
extravagant compound of art and wretched excess is lit up, and the place seems 
less museum, more inhabited. 
</P>
<P>
 A simple thing like lamps made me feel we were wandering through someone's 
home instead of a state parks landmark, which has been criticized for its 
sizable maintenance costs but which is the only site in the system, except a 
Huntington Beach park, that breaks even. Volunteers dressed in period outfits 
mingled in the salons and clinked champagne flutes privately in the sensual 
Roman pool -- lit by alabaster floor lamps. You could almost imagine a 
Hollywood tryst unfolding in a hidden corner. That room! I suddenly remembered 
a childhood fantasy -- fueled by the Madeline book adventures -- of hiding away 
in a museum to wander after-hours among the fancy furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the town of Morro Bay, things were pretty sleepy by 11:30 Saturday 
night. One can drink until closing in the waterfront lounge of Rose's 
restaurant, where the gorgeous wood bar is carved into a boat. Couples 
line-danced to a soft rock duo and their synthesizer and the bartender would 
chat if you struck up the conversation. This appeared to be the only thing 
still open from about 10 p.m. on. 
</P>
<P>
 Meals are not cheap in these parts, but they seldom are in any beach town. We 
stopped at the Googie-style market at the edge of town for a bag of fruit to 
snack on. But breakfast out can run at least $7 or $8 a person for very basic 
eggs and toast, and lunch and dinner is an easy $20 for two -- more if you 
drink beer or wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Our only real purpose was to loaf. So we didn't get rolling before brunch on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The sun was bright, and we ended up at the outdoor tables of a cute place 
called Dorn's Original Breakers Cafe on Market Avenue, overlooking the wharf 
and Morro Rock. Other than the impatient hostess the service was friendly, the 
food plentiful. You can eat inside with a view of the ocean, and if the weather 
is rough most do. As much as the breakfast, I enjoyed the old black-and-white 
photos outside the bathrooms. Besides standard-issue hooked-marlin shots there 
are photos of the fathers of the couple who now own the place. One is the 
founder, the other a former L.A. supervisor who seemed to golf a lot with the 
late Tip O'Neill and James Garner. 
</P>
<P>
 It was windy and cool all day, and we ducked in and out of the shops along the 
water, including some trading post-like stores selling Southwestern geegaws. 
From some old ocean-liner seats plunked down in the middle of an empty dock, we 
sat for a long time gazing at the birds and bobbing sailboats. (One guy was 
having a time navigating a dinghy with a huge German shepherd on board, so 
there was live comedy.) 
</P>
<P>
 After much dawdling we found the initiative to get in the car again and drive 
30 minutes north to Cambria, a place you will hear raves about. We managed to 
spend all of one hour in town before getting bored with it. We took a picture 
of some painted pigs on a fence then headed for the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Lost after trying to follow the "coastal access" signs, we ended up finding 
one such spot: a weathered bench near waves with crashing rocks. Two old men 
sat there together so we lounged nearby. In time we found our way to the nearby 
restaurants and arbitrarily picked one. The Hamlet Restaurant at Moonstone 
Gardens has a 180-degree ocean view from the upstairs bar, where we watched the 
sunset and then went downstairs to eat. Although the food was very good -- 
simple fish and steak -- the most distinctive thing about the place was the 
hostess with a high silver bun who chain-smoked at the front desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose's Landing Restaurant was where we spent our last meal in town, and we 
were alone for a while in the dining room upstairs. The pink linens and soft 
music made for a peaceful lunch overlooking the wooden wharf. The service was 
good, the fish excellent and the chowder decent, though not remarkable. Before 
leaving town we took a walk out to Morro Rock. The tide was out and a dog 
fetched sticks from the waves. Chilly but clear, it was a lovely spot to soak 
in the cold salt air before the drive home. Budget for Two

HIKING: DEATH VALLEY: IT TOOK A MULE TEAM TO MAKE A PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It seems almost a contradiction in terms, particularly when you hike out to 
the old Harmony Borax Works -- a rock salt landscape as tortured as you'll ever 
find. 
</P>
<P>
 A park? 
</P>
<P>
 Surely if the notion of a park was ever mentioned to one of the rough drivers 
of the 20-mule-team borax wagons that crossed Death Valley, the response would 
be unprintable in a family newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet a park it now is. After years of acrimonious debate, the 1994 U.S. 
Congress passed the California Desert Protection Act that set aside millions of 
acres of desert in wilderness area and "upgraded" two national monuments -- 
Joshua Tree and Death Valley -- into national parks. 
</P>
<P>
 But back to borax. In Death Valley, strangely enough, the borax story and the 
park story are almost inseparable. Borax super-salesman Stephen T. Mather 
became the first director of the national park service in 1916. 
</P>
<P>
 "White gold," Death Valley prospectors called it -- not exactly a glamorous 
substance but a profitable one. From 1881 to 1887, more than 20 million pounds 
of borax were transported from the Harmony Borax Works. 
</P>
<P>
 Transport of the borax was the stuff of legends, too. The famous 20-mule teams 
hauled the huge loaded wagons 165 miles to the rail station at Mojave. 
</P>
<P>
 Down-on-his-luck prospector Aaron Winters first discovered borax on the salt 
flats in Furnace Creek in 1881. He was ecstatic when San Francisco investor 
William Coleman purchased his rights to the borax field for $20,000. Coleman 
capitalized construction of the Harmony Borax Works, an endeavor that depended 
first and foremost on the Chinese laborers who gathered the fibrous clusters of 
borate called "cotton balls." 
</P>
<P>
 After purification at the borax works, the substance was loaded into custom 
15-foot-long wagons to be hauled by 10 pairs of mules. The animals were 
controlled by a long jerk line and legendary mule-skinner profanity. 
</P>
<P>
 To learn more about this colorful era, visit the Borax Museum at Furnace Creek 
Ranch and the park visitor center, also located in Furnace Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 Directions: Reach Harmony Borax Works from Furnace Creek by following 
California 190 for 1 1/2 miles to the signed turnoff on the west side of the 
highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Trail head: A short trail with interpretive signs leads past the ruins of the 
old borax refinery and some outlying buildings.  
</P>
<P>
 The main trail leads 1.3 miles over the salt flats. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll travel through a wash to the trail's end at a wood post. From here it's 
less than 200 yards to the edge of the salt marsh where borax was mined. 
</P>
<P>
 Adventurous hikers can make the trail-less trek across sometimes spongy 
terrain to the borax haystacks, two-foot-high piles of sodium calcium borate 
balls stacked here in the 1880s by Chinese laborers to prove claim assessment 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike -- and the photo opportunities -- are particularly good early in the 
morning. Harmony Borax Works Trail Where: Furance Creek, Death Valley National 
Monument Distance: 2.6 miles round trip; to H;aystacks is 5 miles round trip. 
Terrain: Salt flats, the odd "haystacks." Highlights: Colorful walk into Death 
Valley history. Degree of Difficulty: Easy walk through Borax& , moderate walk 
to Haystacks. For More Information: Death Valley National Monument, Death 
Valley, Calif., 92328; tel. (619) 786-2331.

TRAVEL HORRORS; OUR SECOND ANNUAL HALLOWEEN COLLECTION OF SCARY STORIES ABOUT 
TRIP-UPS; TRAVEL HORRORS: EGYPT; CRUISING WITH NILE-ISTS; IT ALMOST BECAME THE 
RIVER OF NO RETURN ON A VOYAGE SKIPPERED BY DISENCHANTED TEEN-AGERS

By SYLVIA WHITMAN, Whitman is a Hyde Park, N.Y., free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The guidebooks made it sound irresistible. "See Egypt as the fishermen do. 
Sail the Nile in a wooden boat. Trail your fingers in the river. Wave at 
children watering their buffaloes. Watch an ibis rise like the cry of baby 
Moses from the rushes. Sleep out on deck under the stars." 
</P>
<P>
 Sound romantic? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it was and it wasn't. But we can learn from our mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 In Aswan, sailboat captains haunt the corniche. "You want felucca ride?" they 
ask. Most tourists take to the river at least for an afternoon. But fair 
numbers opt for longer cruises of several days to Idfu, then catch a bus or 
taxi north to Luxor. When we were there several years ago, before Muslim 
extremists had begun attacking tourists, the three-day, two-night trip cost 
about $50 for a group of four. 
</P>
<P>
 Tired from sightseeing, we left felucca arrangements until our last morning in 
town. Within minutes of stepping out of our hotel, we hooked up with a 
19-year-old skipper named Nagah who grew up sailing his father's produce to 
market. "Find another couple and we go," he said. We asked at the lobbies of 
several hotels but couldn't link up with any companions. Several other captains 
recommended bukra , Egyptian slang, we were told, suggesting we wait until 
tomorrow for more favorable results -- a popular concept in Egypt. But we had 
nonrefundable plane tickets ticking in our packs. Finally, Nagah agreed to 
carry only the two of us, but for the astronomical amount of $50 per person.  
</P>
<P>
 Sigh. Just us and the river. It would be worth every dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most feluccas, the Ambo stretched about 40 feet from bow to stern. It was 
threadbare but watertight. A wooden deck bridged the wide hull, with a 
rectangular break at midsection so gear could be stashed under the deck. On 
cold nights, Nagah and his crew could sleep in the crawl space under the bow, 
but no one would call it a cabin. Like most clothing in Egypt, the mainsail 
showed evidence of repeated mending. Loops of wire connected the metal 
centerboard to its handle. But with thin foam mattresses to cushion the deck 
and a tarp to ward off the sun, we lounged in comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 Once aboard, coming about under a steady breeze, we discovered why Nagah 
hesitated to make a deal: It's illegal for captains to transport fewer than 
three foreigners, he confessed. (Probably a precaution to prevent crimes, we 
guessed.) In addition to the photocopies of our passports, he produced one of a 
stranger and asked us to lie to Egyptian officials. We refused. When we pulled 
up to the trash-strewn island of river officialdom, Namoush, Nagah's teen-age 
pal and first mate, leaped ashore with the inspection certificate for the 
Ambo's fire extinguisher -- and presumably some baksheesh. Soon we were under 
way. No questions asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Uneasy, we debated about ending the voyage then and there. But Nagah didn't 
strike us as a sinister character. Besides, my Tunisian husband was a brother 
Arab and a Muslim -- and could understand most of their dialect. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, a common language didn't rule out communication problems. Before we 
boarded, I had asked about bathroom stops. "Oh, everywhere is a toilet," Nagah 
said. I imagined a plethora of grubby marinas with toilets. Silly me. At a very 
few places where the bank was not too steep to throw down the gangplank, Nagah 
idled the felucca while we followed the trail of toilet-paper wads. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was our night on the town. A few hours out of Aswan, we let off 
Nagah's third crew member, Mohammed, a wiry old salt with splayed teeth and a 
mangled ear. He asked us if we would like to see his village. "Sure," we 
replied. But when we climbed to the top of the bank, we found ourselves 
ankle-deep in sand, under a parching summer sun. What village? Just down the 
road, he said. As we started trudging across the Sahara, we saw the windsock of 
our felucca zipping out into the river. Would we ever see our luggage again? 
</P>
<P>
 The village wasn't near but eventually we caught a ride on the back fender of 
one of the pickup trucks that serve as buses in rural Egypt. At his stop, 
Mohammed tried to soothe us by buying warm Coca-Colas in green bottles. Then he 
insisted we stay for dinner. Behind the wall of his house compound, half a 
dozen barefoot and giggling children scattered at his command. He showed off 
his geese and pressed tiny limes into our hands, as gifts. Sitting on a mat on 
the earthen floor of Mohammed's room, we ate with bread a delicious okra stew 
and an omelet fried in a cast-iron skillet. The leftovers, my husband guessed, 
would feed Mohammed's wife (hidden in the kitchen) and all those children 
peering at us through the window. 
</P>
<P>
 But would we ever see our luggage again? 
</P>
<P>
 We did. Another truck-bus dropped us at Mohammed's field, where we met Nagah's 
father and congratulated him on the birth of a new calf, which we found 
suckling on wobbly legs. Nagah and Namoush were waiting at the riverbank, 
smoking cigarettes they'd bought with our deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The wind had calmed, so we sailed gently through a coral-red sunset and into 
the black, desert night. 
</P>
<P>
 Just us and the river and Nagah's tape recorder. Its batteries were running 
low, accentuating the wailing refrain of a pop hit. Since he owned only one 
tape, it became the theme song of our cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 About midnight, we anchored near five other boatloads of tourists from Aswan. 
As part of the deal, we had bought food -- kilos of tomatoes and potatoes, cans 
of sardines. But Namoush preferred simpler fare. Cooking over a propane burner, 
he boiled, then fried, some macaroni. We sipped some water from our bottle and 
nestled under blankets to sleep, while the felucca captains played cards and 
smoked cigarettes in the bow. 
</P>
<P>
 We set out at dawn, sipping hot tea from glasses. On one bank, a ferry loaded 
passengers and camels. Barges carrying gravel motored past us. With a cigarette 
dangling from his lips, Nagah hooked his knee over the rudder and tried to fix 
his tape recorder -- the picture of dissolute youth. He was bored with the 
river, he said. Although his father had three wives, he was in no hurry to 
marry. After compulsory military service at age 22, he wanted to travel. 
Anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 We moored near the cruise ships at the Temple of Kom Ombo. Empty water 
bottles, cigarette butts and cracker wrappers bobbed by the hull. Some 
travelers quit their feluccas here -- a thought that had crossed our minds. But 
Nagah wouldn't agree to a cut in his fee, so we decided to persevere to Idfu. 
</P>
<P>
 The sun beat unmercifully on the Nile. Beyond Kom Ombo, the river widened, and 
the wind whipped up white caps. Soon our tarp shelter tore from its tie-downs, 
and flapped violently in the wind. We were heeling dramatically, shipping water 
over the gunwales. Although Nagah handled the rudder competently, he and 
Namoush exchanged angry words about the water sloshing over our food and 
supplies. Namoush bailed with a towel, sopping and wringing. 
</P>
<P>
 From the sun decks of the Nile cruise ships, tourists waved -- with envy, we 
imagined, laughing to ourselves. Nagah and Namoush hailed the felucca captains 
sailing slowly upstream. After the Ambo dropped us in Idfu, Nagah said, the two 
boys would meander home. 
</P>
<P>
 Around noon, we beached on a sandy shore lined with date palms. Lunch? We cut 
up a watermelon and watched a farmer persuade a reluctant water buffalo to dip 
in the Nile. Soon the other feluccas coasted in. On one hand, the passengers in 
bikini and suntan oil embarrassed us, picking unripe dates from the trees and 
diving into the buffalo pool. Nagah told my husband that half-naked women have 
no charm -- a compliment, I supposed, to my modest leggings and dress. On the 
other hand, the giddy tourists were having fun. A blond family had rigged a 
fishing pole. On one boat the captain was singing. On another, the mate 
prepared fat pita-bread sandwiches and invited everyone (except us) to eat. 
Unlike Nagah, they seemed to enjoy their work. 
</P>
<P>
 When we pushed off, the other captains called after the Ambo: "Wait, it's too 
early, the wind's too strong." Nagah ignored them. It was rough. We began to 
worry. Abruptly, Nagah announced that we could not continue because of tricky 
weather. Instead of delivering us to Idfu, he planned to turn around and sail 
all the way back to Kom Ombo . . . in other words, to strand us miles from 
where we were supposed to be. 
</P>
<P>
 We balked. We insisted Nagah let us off at the nearest town so we could 
continue to Idfu (and Luxor) by bus. We mentioned the police. Somehow, as 
Namoush maneuvered the centerboard, the wires to the handle snapped. Now the 
Ambo had no keel to steady it. Nagah grounded us on shore. Cursing, the teens 
tried to fix the centerboard, but their only equipment was a screwdriver and 
rages. My husband and I decided to leave. After we paid two thirds of the fare, 
Nagah and Namoush walked us up the bank to a road cutting through a lunar 
landscape and waved down a truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Several vehicles and many hours later, we did reach Luxor.

TRAVEL HORRORS; OUR SECOND ANNUAL HALLOWEEN COLLECTION OF SCARY STORIES ABOUT 
TRIP-UPS; TRAVEL HORRORS: EUROPE; THE JET SET; IT WAS TO BE A FLIGHT TO LONDON 
WITH FELICITOUS, ROMANTIC STOPOVER. OH, THE BEST-LAID PLANS . . .

<P>
 In 1971, at age 25, I was set to embark on eight months of anthropological 
fieldwork in an Alaskan Athapaskan Indian village. The first question was how 
to get there from New Haven, and in keeping with the spirit of adventure, I 
decided to travel via London on Japan Airlines, which offered a stopover. If I 
left JFK on Saturday night I could spend all day Sunday and Monday visiting my 
girlfriend Nancy, who had recently moved to England, and then on Monday I could 
proceed to Anchorage on the weekly nonstop. 
</P>
<P>
 The first sign that this was not the exotic international adventure I had 
hoped for came at the JAL check-in counter where a large sign enthusiastically 
WELCOMED a college tour of sheepskin-jacketed sophomores from Pennsylvania. 
Nevertheless, my seat pocket yielded, along with the traditional air-sickness 
bag and emergency card, dainty paper sandals, a "Happy Jacket" and a miniature 
fan. Dutifully, I robed myself like the airborne samurai I had intended to be, 
ignored the rendition of the Bucknell Fight Song that accompanied the firing of 
the engines, and awaited the hoped-for tea ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whereya from?" my seatmate demanded. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought of concocting a foreign accent and fabricating an answer like 
"Katmandu" or "Vladivostok," but he barely paused for breath. 
</P>
<P>
 "Me, I'm from Staten Island, N.Y., myself. Unbelievable place. Ever hear of 
Tottenville High? No? Unbelievable football season." 
</P>
<P>
 And then he recounted it, every game, every play, every player, including 
frequent mention of Ricky Tantolino, his nephew, injured in the first scrimmage 
but gamely on the sidelines ever after. Sometime after homecoming, I began to 
cast furtive glances out the window for the White Cliffs of Dover. We were due 
to arrive in London at 8:50 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8:30, Tottenville had just been cheated out of the district championship 
when the airplane's loudspeaker erupted in an excited burst of Japanese. The 
heretofore implacable faces of the Japanese travelers suddenly became placable; 
as one, their jaws seemed to tighten and they unfastened their seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
 At last, an English translation was provided: "Your pilot, Mr. Ito, regrets to 
inform you that Heathrow is closed because of fog, so we will go instead to 
Paris." 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Tottenville slapped his thigh. "Bad for you, good for me," he chortled. "I 
was going to Paris, anyway." Mysteriously, however, after an hour's flying 
time, no land appeared -- just clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 Another two-minute burst of high-pitched Japanese interrupted the Muzak. As 
the complexions of my Asian fellow-travelers paled to Noh hues, we were 
informed in English that, though Paris was, indeed, somewhere below us -- and 
had been for the past 20 minutes of circling -- it was currently experiencing a 
snowstorm and so was also closed to arriving flights. Capt. Ito figured we'd 
better head for Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to my forebodings, Leonardo da Vinci Airport was open. Following 
instructions, we debarked, boarded a small shuttle bus, and segregated 
ourselves into "Happy to be in Rome," "Wish we were in Paris," and "Wish we 
were in London" groups. Numbering a disgruntled 12, the England contingent was 
the smallest but had the advantage of containing all nine Japanese passengers: 
two young student-types and seven businessmen. Besides myself, the rest of our 
little band consisted of a middle-aged Brit and a youngish American man. A 
Japan Airlines official with the improbable name of Gino Campanile gathered us 
together like conspirators. Heathrow was still closed, he informed us three 
English speakers, but JAL would like us to be their guests at a gala lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 With visions of Italian delicacies dancing in our heads, we followed him 
briskly to the airport dining room, only to be informed that there were no 
available tables. Our next stop was the cocktail bar where we were promised a 
drink and sandwich, but this room too, was full. After much telephone 
consultation punctuated with shrugs and eyes to the ceiling Gino presented us 
with, as he called them, "the alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
 Plan "A" was that we should all board a Kuwait Airlines plane, which was, at 
this very moment, preparing to take off nonstop to London. 
</P>
<P>
 "So Heathrow has opened," deduced Morris, the Englishman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, no," replied Gino. "To our knowledge, it is still closed." Not pausing 
for objections, he continued with Plan "B": We would all go to a "seaside 
hotel," courtesy of JAL, and wait there until 8 a.m., at which time a JAL plane 
would "surely" deposit us in London, provided that Zurich, its first stop, was 
not closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Will Zurich be closed, do you think?" asked Morris. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know, but I think so," replied Gino. He then asked us to make a 
decision immediately since Air Kuwait was awaiting our bidding, and he further 
asked that we reach a consensus, since JAL didn't want to be responsible for a 
"split group." 
</P>
<P>
 "But," sputtered Morris, who was getting upset, "if London is closed, how can 
Kuwait airlines land there?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That, I do not know," allowed Gino. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally I asked Gino (with a wink to assure him that I was not as heated and 
demanding as Morris), what he would do in our position. He replied that since 
Kuwait Airlines was not known for their safety record and might well attempt to 
land in London, closed or not, he would "surely" opt for the seaside hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The American (a doctor named Jim), Morris, and I, and the sole Japanese 
gentleman, Mr. Hiruma, who spoke enough English to follow the conversation, 
immediately voted to wait. Hiruma relayed the decision and its motivation to 
his co-nationals, and we all boarded a small airport transport bound, we 
assumed, for food and rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it pulled up to a Ceylon Airlines plane, bound nonstop for London. 
Gino, obviously relieved that his supervisory duties were at an end, proclaimed 
that London was now open and our luggage had been reloaded. And so, we left the 
Eternal City, drank a cup of tea in the air . . . and landed in Frankfurt. 
Heathrow was closed, it was announced in Tamil and English. 
</P>
<P>
 Grumbling, we marched into the Frankfurt Airport, but no sooner had we entered 
the building than we were out again, this time lured away by British European 
Airways. Heathrow was reopening. Upon exiting the building, one of the Japanese 
students, looking frantic, had grabbed me, demanding in a heavy accent, "Why 
are we leaving London?" There had not been any announcements in Japanese for a 
long time, and Hiruma had clammed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Flying time was to be an hour and a half, but in an hour and 15 minutes we 
landed . . . in Paris. London, you see, was closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ours was a silent, dejected, exodus into Le Bourget. Through the frosty 
windows, we could see thousands of stranded people in waiting rooms, gazing 
longingly toward the Channel. We were given vouchers, but at the restaurant 
were told that the only food left was peanuts -- of which we consumed large 
quantities. We waited, huddled on plastic seats or stretched out on the floor, 
until 11 p.m. when it was announced that London had closed for the night and we 
would all be put up in a hotel downtown. We were instructed to clear customs, 
find our luggage and board a bus. 
</P>
<P>
 To no one's great surprise, really, our belongings were apparently headed for 
Columbo. Hiruma and I laughed rather hysterically. My duffel bag was stuffed 
with the carefully selected items I would need for an eight-month stay in rural 
Alaska, plus the written record of all my previous work there. His suitcase 
contained crucial papers for a business call he was scheduled to make from 
London the following morning. But Jim's situation was even worse: It seems he 
was a plastic surgeon, on his way to Newcastle to perform a series of cosmetic 
procedures. His trunk was full of plastic, which, if placed in too warm an area 
-- like Ceylon -- would melt. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 45-minute ride through the snowy streets of Paris, we arrived at the 
Hotel Palais D'Orsay, a monumental relic at the Pont des Invalides which had 
been awarded, in 1948, four stars. There were already hundreds of exhausted 
travelers there before us, demanding suites with baths, and by the time our 
turn arrived, we were assigned tiny rooms on the top floor; fortunately we had 
no baggage to carry. 
</P>
<P>
 It was now 2 a.m., but I telephoned Nancy in London. She had called Japan 
Airlines continuously all day and had been advised by recorded messages (the 
first five minutes of which were in Japanese) that we were in, variously, 
Vienna, Dublin, Madrid and Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 I finally dozed off, only to be awakened at 5 a.m. by a French voice on the 
phone, and ordered "to make haste." With literally nothing to pack, I was 
downstairs in a flash . . . only to be told at the desk by the giggling Hiruma 
that London had closed again and we weren't to leave the hotel for the airport 
until 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Our group of JAL veterans descended upon the ornate and unused dining room, 
where we were treated to a hearty breakfast of stale rolls and coffee, after 
which I improvised sign language to invite the Japanese student to go for a 
walk along the Seine. At every big building, he asked hopefully, "Notre Dame?" 
I'd shake my head and he'd look dejected. As we were heading back, he tried a 
last time, gesturing toward a small structure near the Louvre: "Notre Dame?" I 
figured he'd had enough disappointments in the past 24 hours, so I nodded my 
head enthusiastically, expecting a wide smile. Instead, he shrugged and said, 
I'm quite sure, "Big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 On the way to the airport, the bus picked up a few more British passengers who 
were quick to make analogies to Dunkirk. When we got there, surprise: London 
was closed, and we spent a foodless, chairless, seven hours browsing through 
the tax-free perfume display. Sad stories abounded among the displaced -- there 
was, for instance, the weekend tour group from Lisbon who were booked for three 
days of London theater, dining and sightseeing, but were now scheduled to go 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was the young actress I spoke to -- very British and traveling 
with Mummy from Rome. She was to have had her "big break" today, she kept 
intoning, a TV commercial for chocolate Easter eggs, which would have been 
shown in Wales this year and hit Channel 1 in 1974 -- at which time she fully 
expected to be "discovered." Mummy, in an attempt to be positive, said, "Now, 
dear, just think of all those wretched sweets you would have had to eat." 
</P>
<P>
 Brigitte Bardot and her entourage were there, too, particularly plagued by a 
male passenger from a stranded Alitalia flight, who continuously slunk past 
her, eyes hooded but burning. Sporting her famous moue, Bardot looked through 
him, while the ex-Easter egg girl perched next to any man just long enough to 
hear him say, " You're far prettier." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, at 3:30 p.m., it was announced that the Rome/Frankfurt group (us) would 
be taken to a nearby restaurant for lunch. Ravenous, we assembled . . . only to 
hear the further announcement that we were to board our flight immediately. As 
the engines roared and we taxied away from the terminal, we cheered and waved 
at the unfortunates within . . . only to be told a moment later that the only 
airport in the United Kingdom currently receiving in-bound traffic was 
Edinburgh, so we would return to wait longer at Le Bourget. The Japanese 
passengers began to chant something that must have been the equivalent of "We 
shall not be moved." After some deliberation the captain announced that if it 
was Scotland we wanted, it was Scotland we would get! Morris calculated that we 
could at least take the 10-hour train ride to London. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, northwest we flew for nearly two bumpy hours . . . and landed! . . . 
but before the plane had come to the gate, Manchester, to the south, opened, 
and so we took off again and flew toward there. Just as we were preparing to 
descend, Birmingham, still closer to London, cleared and so we headed there, 
instead, and at last taxied to a full stop. 
</P>
<P>
 This story has a postscript. When Nancy greeted me at her flat with homemade 
tomato soup, a hot bath and flannel sheets, I decided I was in love. I had 
already missed my connection to Anchorage and so, after a long sleep, Nancy and 
I had a blissful week together. On the flight across the Pole, and then daily 
for two weeks from the native village (with no telephones) where I was doing my 
fieldwork, I wrote her proclaiming my great affection . . . to which I received 
no answer whatsoever. When her silence stretched to a month, then six weeks, 
the tone of my correspondence changed from peevish to hurt to outraged 
betrayal, culminating with a masterpiece in which I listed every fault I had 
ever found with her over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 The very day after posting that letter, I received a fat packet of mail all 
bearing Nancy's London return address. I opened a note at random. The first 
line read, "I wish this damn postal strike would end."

 Driving from San Francisco to New York takes 4 1/2 days if you make it to Salt 
Lake City the first night. Then your second night is in North Platte, Neb., the 
third near the Mississippi, the fourth in Cleveland and the fifth finds you 
tired but smug in the Big Apple. However, if you fool around and sleep in until 
5 a.m. instead of 4 that first morning, you reach Wendover, Utah, well beyond 
the dinner hour, and the Great Salt Desert is too foreboding to attempt before 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time a friend and I headed east in my old Volkswagen we were 
determined to reach Salt Lake City. Thursday morning we were each up at 4 a.m. 
and were on Route 80 by a quarter to five. No breakfast; that we would save for 
our first rest stop. When we pulled into Roseville we gave ourselves a pat on 
the back for having waited until we came to a charming town. Charm, food and 
making good time, that's what travel is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the Sierra, through Tahoe, around Reno and on to Winnemucca for the lunch 
break.  
</P>
<P>
 It may have been there, in Winnemucca, that we interrupted the hands on back 
for the question we should have considered before departure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you," Mary asked, "make a motel reservation for tonight?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No need," I answered. "I've made this trip four or five times. There's no 
problem finding a motel in Salt Lake City, particularly on a Thursday night." 
</P>
<P>
 And so we headed back into the wide tan landscape of Nevada. We reached the 
border and Wendover, Utah, at the edge of the Great Salt Lake Desert by 6. 
Hamburger, Coke, bathroom break and a brief return to the motel question. We 
could call ahead from here for a motel listed in the AAA booklet. But we were 
more adventurous than that -- and cheaper. Besides, it was only 6:30 p.m. as we 
pulled out of town. We'd be in Salt Lake City before 9:30. 
</P>
<P>
 Three hours later we arrived in Salt Lake City, paused for a moment of 
self-congratulation, then headed along the first main street, looking for a 
cheap and charming motel. There were three motels in the first block -- all 
with No Vacancy signs. But it was 9:15 p.m.; we had plenty of time. On the next 
block we passed another full establishment, but were buoyed to note the one 
after that had no ill-omened sign. 
</P>
<P>
 We pulled into the parking lot before we realized that the management here 
signaled its glut of tourists by turning off all advertising lights. It did, 
however, have a clock. Ten-thirty p.m., it said. We'd forgotten about the time 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 It was several blocks before we came to a motel office that looked somewhat 
welcoming. Here, we discovered that not only were they, too, full, but there 
was a huge Mormon gathering in town and every other decent motel was booked. 
</P>
<P>
 It was after midnight when we found it: Bob's Motel. Decent or not, we were 
too tired to care. We could sleep anywhere, we told each other. Bob himself sat 
at the desk, a muscular man in his mid-40s.  
</P>
<P>
 "You want the $5 room, or the $7 dollar?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Having both worked for the welfare department we knew what $5 rooms were like. 
We blew the extra $2 and opted for the luxury unit. A good decision, we 
thought, as we made our way around two guys lounging at the edge of the cement 
walkway by the $5 rooms.  
</P>
<P>
 The $7 room was on the second of three floors. The night was hot, and despite 
all evidence to the contrary, we both hoped for air-conditioning -- even one of 
those ancient rattling window units.  
</P>
<P>
 The room contained a lumpy double bed. We put our suitcases on the floor (the 
only available spot). I was bending over to unzip mine when I noticed the 
cockroach. I had lived in Manhattan and was no novice to the world of 
cockroachery. The goal of the roach is to slither into a suitcase, nest among 
the silks and arrive in Manhattan as a progenitor of a new nation of vermin. Up 
on the bed came the valises. 
</P>
<P>
 There was, of course, no air conditioner. The window overlooked the stairs but 
at least it would give us air. Mary had started to pull back the drapes when 
she realized that our predecessors had mistaken them for handkerchiefs. 
Carefully, she pulled them shut and went into the bathroom to wash her hands. 
When she returned we shifted the bags to one side and cautiously lifted 
bedspreads. The sheets were a memoir of our predecessors' joys and accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's always a silver lining. Since we had to sleep in our clothes, we 
wouldn't be opening the suitcases. We allowed ourselves ever so light a pat on 
the back, before laying ourselves out in pine box fashion atop the bedspread.  
</P>
<P>
 We were asleep soon. And awake soon thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 A metallic creaking came from above us. Bed springs. We laughed, not worried. 
The room above had to be like ours. And in heat like this the greatest passion 
would have its limits. We gave them 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The rattling peaked and died in 15. It was still only 12:30. We could get six 
good hours of sleep. With the residue of smugness draped over us like a sheet, 
we sighed and relaxed. That was when the door upstairs banged shut, as did the 
door to the hall. They've argued, we hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 It was another 20 minutes before the door banged again and the springs started 
to creak. And another half-hour after that . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning we shuffled bleary-eyed to a restaurant, and drank two cups 
of coffee before we were awake enough to call North Platte, Neb., and reserve a 
room.

<P>
 My sister and I picked a good hotel: a clean place with whitewashed walls, a 
quaintly thatched roof, toilets that worked and hot water. It was a far cry 
from the other places we had stayed at during the two weeks in Guatemala. The 
room in Chichicastenango had been windowless, smelled of urine, had two 
straw-stuffed pads instead of beds, and sported a family toilet planted neatly 
in the middle of the courtyard. In Flores, we had made do with a tin roof that 
leaked, chattering bats in the rafters and spoiled pork for dinner. I had spent 
a good part of the past six years living in the jungles of Costa Rica and I 
prided myself on traveling tough, but my sister -- who was new to the tropics 
-- had had it. She had a stomachache (soon to become a case of amoebic 
dysentery that would ultimately land her in intensive care -- but that's 
another story). 
</P>
<P>
 "For God's sake let's pay whatever it takes to get a toilet seat that doesn't 
fall off," she begged. She had been a great sport, but she was getting that 
glassy look in her eyes that meant she was about to crack. It was the same look 
she had given me when she was 12, and I invited her to Mexico City, picked her 
up at the airport, and drove her through a riot, so I gave in. 
</P>
<P>
 That afternoon we checked into the nicest hotel in Tikal and spent the rest of 
the day in the park climbing the pyramids, watching the howler monkeys and 
admiring the phosphorescent blue butterflies. At dusk, we even spotted a timid, 
deerlike agouti peering out of the brush. That night as we lay in our 
comfortable beds in our ever-so comfortable hotel, the jungle frogs sang us to 
sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 I woke in pitch blackness, sometime around midnight, with the distinct 
sensation that I was not alone. Suddenly, like galley slaves rowing to the same 
beat, a host of little things all bit me simultaneously. With a howl, I 
catapulted out of bed and staggered around the room, slapping randomly. Roused 
out of a sound sleep, my sister went for the lights, but there were no lights. 
The electricity had been turned off at 10 -- not an uncommon occurrence in the 
tropics.  
</P>
<P>
 "Help!" I yelled as I continued my St. Vitus' dance around the dark room, 
slapping, stumbling, tripping over the luggage, and generally doing a great 
imitation of someone who had lost her mind. Being a level-headed sort, my 
sister located a flashlight, turned the beam on me, and to our mutual horror we 
discovered I was covered from head to toe with ants. Snatching off my 
nightgown, she began to beat me with a towel, smashing the little suckers, 
while I went on hopping and screaming. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When I was de-antified and a few degrees calmer, she directed the flashlight 
toward my bed. It was seething like an anthill that had been kicked in. 
Thousands of ants were crawling across the pillow and sheets, but that wasn't 
the worst of it: There were more ants streaming down the wall of the room in a 
column four or five feet wide and several inches thick. In many tropical 
buildings, the walls don't go all the way up to the ceiling. The ants had 
located the space and were rushing through it in unbelievable quantities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looks like a goddamned waterfall," my sister observed as the black column 
poured down the wall. "In a few seconds they would have gotten to my bed. 
Thanks for sounding the alarm. I can just imagine our skeletons lying there, 
picked to the bone." 
</P>
<P>
 Summoning what little dignity I had left, I brushed the smashed ants off my 
naked body. 
</P>
<P>
 "Army ants don't eat people," I announced. My voice grew shrill. "There is 
nothing to fear." 
</P>
<P>
 "How do we make them go away?" 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't. When the army ants march, the local people gather up all their food 
and move out of their houses until they've passed. The ants are a kind of pest 
control service. By the time they're done there's not a snake, rat or bug 
left." I was always one for appreciating the balance of nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "Son of a bitch," my sister said. "You mean we're stuck with these things for 
the rest of the night?" 
</P>
<P>
 By now the other guests in the hotel were all awake, and, convinced we were 
being murdered, they had begun to pound on our door. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you two OK?" a voice called. 
</P>
<P>
 We dressed, went out and explained the ant situation to our fellow tourists. 
There were perhaps 15 of us altogether, from Germany, France, Canada and the 
United States, mostly young, mostly experienced travelers, but no one had been 
through an army ant invasion. Since the entire staff of the hotel had 
mysteriously disappeared, we were on our own. 
</P>
<P>
 Sleep being out of the question, we arranged ourselves on the sofas in the 
lobby, pulled up our feet so the ants wouldn't crawl over them, and waited. A 
few people tried to make ant jokes, but no one was in the mood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to go the bathroom," a German woman announced. Several of us picked 
our way to the door with her, but by now the bathroom floor was a heaving mass 
of ants. It was clear they were going to troop through every room in the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 We waited. Above us, the thatch began to make soft rustling noises. Suddenly 
there was a plop, and a scorpion about the size of a human hand hit the floor 
running. Fifteen tourists screamed simultaneously. No, make that 14. There was 
one guy who wouldn't have screamed if you'd put a red hot poker to his 
forehead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scorpions!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Are they poisonous?" 
</P>
<P>
 You bet they were. The old hands insisted that little ones were even more 
poisonous -- even fatal -- but that was small consolation. These were big, 
their bites could land you in the hospital, and by now they were falling like 
hail, dozens at a time, driven out of the thatched roof by the ants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Umbrellas!" a guy suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 We rose like one person, fled back to our rooms, seized our umbrellas, opened 
them to keep off the scorpions, and retreated to the lobby, where we sat, 
hunched up against one another, like people waiting for a bus in a rainstorm. 
Occasionally a large scorpion would hit one of the umbrellas, bounce to the 
floor, and scuttle away, but it never got far before the ants mobbed it. After 
two hours of this, we were so tired we could hardly sit upright. It was then 
that a man whose name I never knew, but whom neither I nor my sister will ever 
forget, made one of the most generous offers one human being has ever made to 
another: "The ants haven't made it to my room yet. If you and your sister would 
like to try to get some sleep in my bed, I'll hold an umbrella over you." We 
checked him out. He was perhaps 28, thin, with dark brown hair, and he had a 
face that inspired confidence. Reassured that this wasn't some crazy plot to 
seduce both of us in the middle of an ant invasion, we agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next few hours, my sister and I lay side by side in his bed as he sat 
next to us, silently holding a large black umbrella over our bodies so we 
wouldn't get stung by falling scorpions. Somehow against all odds we fell 
asleep. When we woke the umbrella was neatly furled, and the chair was empty. 
He was gone, and so were the ants.

TRAVEL HORRORS: NEW YORK; THE APPLE'S REVENGE; THEIR ANNIVERSARY WEEKEND 
CREATED MEMORIES THAT CAN'T BE REPLACED . . . UNLIKE THEIR LUGGAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 "HOLIDAY WEEKEND BARGAIN! TAKE A BITE OUT OF THE BIG APPLE FOR $125 A NIGHT." 
</P>
<P>
 This offer from New York's Marriott Marquis, mailed to our Chevy Chase home a 
few weeks before last Memorial Day weekend, was almost impossible for my wife, 
Ellen, and me to resist. That weekend coincided not only with our own 35th 
wedding anniversary but with the fifth anniversary of our daughter Cindy and 
her husband, Brooks, who live in the neighboring Maryland suburb of Silver 
Spring. The stage seemed set for a high-concept joint celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 We planned not only to enjoy our visit to New York, but to recycle the 
memories for years to come. And all for $125 a night, which by the standards of 
Manhattan, where hotel prices are as high as the skyline, seemed quite a 
bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, though, our trip to Gotham brought memories of the wrong 
kind. Right now, when we look back on our visit the recollections that come to 
mind are not of our visits to New York's bright spots. Instead we tend to dwell 
on the looting of my wife's purse in the hotel elevator, the burglary of our 
car in broad daylight on a Greenwich Village street and our subsequent trip to 
the dingy confines of the Ninth Precinct station house, all of which 
transformed our 24 hours in Manhattan from an anniversary waltz into something 
reminiscent of the Neil Simon play and film "The Out-of-Towners." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, we did not think of ourselves as anything like the yokels played by 
Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis in the movie. In fact, we thought of ourselves as 
quasi-New Yorkers. We had all lived in the city or its environs and visited 
there often. We knew of the perils that lurk in the asphalt jungle, but we 
thought we could cope with them. And we did take precautions. 
</P>
<P>
 To be extra secure we no sooner had arrived in midtown Manhattan on Saturday 
afternoon, than we invested $19.95 to stash our car safely in a garage right 
across 46th Street from the Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks and Cindy immediately set off for the Salon de Tokyo, a massage salon 
near Central Park, specializing in shiatsu. Ellen and I decided just to stroll 
around Manhattan in the brilliant May sunshine. But heading down to the lobby, 
we were reminded of one of the Marriott's shortcomings. Its Times Square 
location is convenient, the rooms are comfortable and the staff is friendly. 
But the hotel is under-elevatored. By the time the light flashes and the car 
arrives, it is often as crammed as the subway at rush hour, and we waited 
impatiently while car after car zipped past our floor. Because we were still 
angry about the wait, and about barely being able to breathe once we boarded, 
we did not notice that someone had dipped into Ellen's purse and snatched her 
wallet, which contained two checkbooks, a bank card and $80 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Oblivious to Ellen's missing valuables, we strolled leisurely down Fifth 
Avenue and got back to the hotel in time for a pre-dinner cocktail in The View, 
a 50th-floor rotating bar atop the hotel (which fortunately can be reached 
through a special elevator). For the price of a glass of California Chardonnay 
and a Miller Lite ($12 for both) most of Manhattan, from the Battery to the 
Triboro Bridge was stretched out at our feet.  
</P>
<P>
 Next we rendezvoused with Brooks and Cindy and taxied downtown to the Chelsea 
Central, a trendy Greenwich Village restaurant that was nearly empty. "Nobody 
comes downtown on Memorial Day," our waiter told us cheerfully. 
</P>
<P>
 Seated in a carved oak banquette under the lofty stamped tin ceiling, we dined 
on soft shell crab, lobster bisque, encrusted salmon, risotto and corn cakes 
and linguine with portobello mushrooms all for $160, complete with drinks, two 
bottles of wine and tip. 
</P>
<P>
 To work off the splendid meal, and to enjoy the sights of Greenwich Village, 
we decided to hike the mile to the Lortel Theater on Christopher Street to see 
"Four Dogs and a Bone," a satire about four people involved in making a motion 
picture. Its author, Patrick Shanley, had scripted "Moonstruck," and the 
critics had hailed the "crackling wit" of his latest work.  
</P>
<P>
 We found it pointless and tasteless, but we all agreed that no one really 
minded after our great dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Early next morning, when even the elevators came promptly, we grabbed a quick 
breakfast in the hotel coffee shop and took a cab uptown to the Whitney Museum 
of American Art to see the spectacular Richard Avedon photography show then on 
display. By now we were convinced the Big Apple was our oyster. Taking full 
advantage of this second successive sparkling day, we hiked back to the hotel 
along Fifth Avenue, scorning the taxis and horse-drawn carriages. Checking 
ourselves out of the Marriott, and the car out of the parking garage, we drove 
downtown to Greenwich Village, planning a visit to the Strand, a celebrated 
second-hand book store, and a late lunch before leaving town. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubris brought us down. Flushed with our (mostly) successes so far, we were 
convinced we could find New York's rarest jewel, a parking place. Twenty 
minutes of searching yielded no results, but I was determined: "Let's look a 
little more," I insisted. "I feel lucky." Then, right in front of us, a car 
suddenly pulled away from the curb on East 4th Street and we hustled into the 
spot.  
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, I can detect the red flags that should have warned us off. 
Though it was mid-afternoon, and a Tower Record store on the corner of 
Lafayette and Fourth was open for business, an ominous silence pervaded the 
street. In our prolonged search for a parking place, we had wandered too far 
from the hustle and bustle of the west side of the Village. And our Maryland 
license plates marked us as out-of-towners. 
</P>
<P>
 But, persuaded that our belongings were secure in the locked trunk, we set off 
for the Strand: tens of thousands of volumes in two sprawling levels, sensibly 
categorized, alphabetically stacked and guarded by clerks who actually know the 
stock well enough to aid in the search for a hard-to-find volume. Our book 
browsing and buying had stoked our appetites, so we lunched at the Second 
Avenue Delicatessen, a 15-minute walk away. Sated with corned beef on rye and 
crisp pickles, we headed back to the car.  
</P>
<P>
 The thieves were slick. They left not so much as a scratch on the trunk lid to 
betray their dirty work. Our first clue came when the trunk key would not work. 
I began to suspect the worst. My heart sinking, I flipped the latch under the 
driver's seat to open the trunk. In my life I have never seen any space as 
empty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's the wrong car," Brooks said implausibly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh my God," said Ellen. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone were a half-dozen suitcases and garment bags. We quickly drove five 
blocks to the nearby Ninth Precinct, where -- miracle of miracles -- we once 
again found a parking place. This time we had no reason to worry about leaving 
the car since there was nothing left to steal but the car itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of this stuff going on," P. J. Williams, the administrative 
clerk at the precinct told us as she processed our claim. "We should probably 
put up signs warning people." 
</P>
<P>
 While Ellen and I filled out the police claim forms, at the clerk's suggestion 
we dispatched Brooks and Cindy to a nearby playground. It had been transformed 
into a kind of thieves market. Clothing, jewelry, radios and other valuables 
that had once belonged to other unfortunate visitors to (and no doubt residents 
of) the Big Apple were strewn on the ground to entice passersby. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Cindy reported when she and Brooks returned: "Our stuff was nowhere in 
sight." Undoubtedly others had already found bargains for themselves in our 
bargain weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 We tallied our losses as we drove drearily back to Maryland: favorite items of 
clothing and jewelry that had more sentimental than monetary value, 
particularly a watch that I had given Ellen on our first anniversary, 34 years 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning after we returned, we had reason to feel even worse. Looking 
through her purse, Ellen finally discovered that her wallet had been ripped off 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure we bashed New York. But with the passing of time we have had the chance 
to think more about our bargain that backfired and put it in some perspective.  
</P>
<P>
 Most important, no one was hurt. Also, nearly everything we lost could be 
replaced, at least in a material sense. Under our insurance coverage we 
collected about 80 cents on every dollar we claimed. Also, the hotel returned 
Ellen's checkbooks and bank card, which the thief had apparently dumped soon 
after he left the elevator with her $80. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, we are not ready to give up on our erstwhile hometown, the Big 
Apple, on its restaurants, its museums, its theaters (even when the satire 
falls flat), and its hotels (even when the elevators don't run on time). But 
are we going to be more vigilant? You bet. 
</P>
<P>
 And not just in New York. The month after our anniversary trip the four of us 
drove down to Kitty Hawk, N.C., for our annual summer escape to the beaches of 
the Outer Banks. Crime on the Outer Banks either goes unreported or 
uncommitted. But this summer, for the first time in the more than 20 years that 
we have vacationed there, when we left our oceanfront cottage to sit on the 
beach less than 100 feet away, we locked all the doors and took the key with 
us.

TRAVEL HORRORS: HAWAII; PARADISE LOST; POST-EARTHQUAKE, THEY SOUGHT SOLACE IN 
HAWAII, BUT NATURE GAVE THEM A FEW MORE SHOCKS 
</P>

<P>
 We had had just about enough and weren't going to take it any more. Enough of 
the late-night aftershocks, the anxiety over the possibility of late-night 
aftershocks and the heavy traffic. So we did what any reasonable couple would 
do after an earthquake -- we planned a vacation in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 This was last February, just a few weeks after the Earth moved for all of us, 
and we stopped taking for granted some of the things we took for granted 
before. Except for Hawaii. We took it for granted that it would be sunny and 
85. And all we got was: rain! 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, I know what you're saying: "It's the tropics, stupid! It rains there!" 
</P>
<P>
 But not usually like this. This was horizontal rain, the kind you see on CNN 
just after Tropical Storm Billy Bob has touched down on some poor Caribbean 
island. 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, there were signs along the way that this vacation was not going 
to be what Marissa, my wife, and I had in mind. We made reservations at our 
favorite bed & breakfast on Oahu, and last March we finally boarded the plane. 
We had a great coach fare on a major carrier and didn't think there would be 
any problem, but the smell of trouble was in the air.  
</P>
<P>
 We arrived at our seats and immediately picked up a strange odor. We thought 
it might be the diapered toddler in the middle seat, but no, his mother said, 
he was not to blame. The smell was definitely there, however, and after another 
whiff we identified it: Eau de Vomit. 
</P>
<P>
 So we summoned the flight attendant. She made a funny face as she approached 
our seats, so it was fairly apparent that she knew what the problem was. She 
was concerned but she noted that the plane was full and said we would just have 
to tough it out. 
</P>
<P>
 We were about ready to grab our hand luggage and take another flight (it was 
that bad), when the flight attendant came back and said she had found a couple 
that were willing to trade seats. They were in the row right in back of the 
bulkhead. He was claustrophobic and didn't think he could make the flight 
without becoming ill. So we happily obliged. 
</P>
<P>
 We settled into our seats and watched as the exasperated couple picked up the 
scent and began their round of complaints. Finally, a rather large airline 
maintenance worker marched by carrying a rather small can of disinfectant 
spray. The stricken look on the couple's faces a few minutes later indicated 
that the problem was still lingering. The claustrophobic traveler was probably 
thinking that he preferred the prospect of his own nausea to the reminder of 
someone else's.  
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, Marissa nudged me in the ribs. "We're moving," she whispered. And so 
we did. The flight attendant was whisking us up to the rarefied air of business 
class while the other couple restaked their claim to the bulkhead seats. We 
were relieved and a bit smug at the outcome of the problem that had threatened 
the start of our vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 And smug we continued to be, right up until landing time at Honolulu airport. 
Our friends Bruce and Janette Hale met us at the plane. As we watched the 
drizzle over lunch, they urged us not to worry. "This will blow out," Bruce 
said. "The weather will be fine," Janette reassured us. 
</P>
<P>
 So we grabbed our rental car and started our drive over the hill to Kailua and 
our B&B. The house we were staying at is literally right on the sand at Lanikai 
Beach. The last time we stayed there the weather was bright and balmy. We awoke 
each morning to the sound of the ocean and the view of two lovely islands just 
200 yards off the coast. But this time the rain that had followed us from the 
airport to Kailua did not let up. It didn't let up that night and it didn't let 
up the next day. In fact, it got worse. The beaches were empty, the skies were 
darker than battleship gray and the wind was howling. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning the Honolulu paper, which under normal conditions seems to be 
under a municipal ordinance to downplay reports of inclement weather, published 
pictures and stories we couldn't ignore: flooded cars, near-flooded houses, 
near-flooded sewers . . . and all of it just a few minutes from where we were. 
</P>
<P>
 Marissa, who has lived in the tropics and visited the South Pacific 
frequently, examined the reports with a worried look on her face. "It looks 
bad," she said, shaking her head. She was right. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain or no, I decided to go for a jog, and I noticed more ominous signs 
telling me that the beach was closed because of sewage runoff from the storm. 
That beach, of course, was the one just 10 yards in front of our B&B. So for 
the next couple of days we passed the time watching the rain fall and the wind 
blow. We read, played Scrabble, played cards, pitched pennies, wrote letters 
and generally went stir crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 One particular afternoon, our friend Bruce urged us to come over the hill with 
the promise of sunshine. We drove over the Pali Highway, found Sans Souci Beach 
and had a lovely time even though the sun was darting in and out of the clouds. 
Marissa was happy and getting tan, I was happy and getting sunburned and things 
couldn't be better, but the joy was fleeting as the clouds came in bringing 
more rain. As it turned out, weather was the least of our worries. 
</P>
<P>
 We left for home and stopped at a local health-food restaurant and each ate a 
generous lunch of tuna sandwiches and strawberry-banana protein shakes with bee 
pollen. As we headed for the car, Marissa said her throat was itching and her 
hands were tingling. 
</P>
<P>
 We got home and she thought she'd lay down for a nap, but she said she was 
having trouble breathing. I felt my jaw start to drop as I watched her face 
turn red and start to swell. And then she uttered that simple phrase that 
nobody wants to hear at any time but especially on vacation: "I think we'd 
better go to the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 My head was screaming "NO!!!!!" as we hustled toward the car and went off down 
the highway. We found Castle Medical Center, a hospital with a good, efficient 
emergency room. They quickly diagnosed Marissa's illness as a food allergy and 
gave her a shot of adrenaline and Benadryl to tame the reaction. By the time we 
got home, the medicine was doing its magic. Marissa slept for the next 16 
hours, and I watched the clouds roll in and out and started to grow wistful for 
the nightly round of aftershocks.  
</P>
<P>
 Marissa woke up the next day a little shaken by the whole experience. She's a 
photojournalist by trade and has visited some of the world's funkiest places 
without any health problems. She never expected to land in the hospital in 
paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 The next two days passed rather quietly. I lost more games of Scrabble to 
Marissa and she started to feel better. I couldn't tell if her improved 
condition was due to the medicine or the aggregate Scrabble score. 
</P>
<P>
 The night before we left, the storms lifted a bit and we sat on our patio 
watching the ocean. Crews in sleek catamarans raced by, and we noticed that two 
orange-vested men in a dingy were taking water samples, checking for 
contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 As dawn broke we were awakened by a sight we hadn't seen in all the time we 
had been in Kailua: bright sunshine. There wasn't a cloud in the sky. That was 
the up side. The down side was that our plane left at noon. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood was a buzz of activity as the morning went on. The warning 
signs were gone and the beaches started to fill up again with eager 
sun-worshippers. We turned our attention to the business of packing. But the 
urge to take a last swim was just too much and we headed for the ocean. The 
water was warm and gentle and generally lovely. And for those brief hours, 
Hawaii was again the island of our dreams.

TRAVEL HORRORS: THE WORLD; ALL THE WAY WITH LBJ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MURIEL DOBBIN, Dobbin is now a national correspondent and White House 
reporter for the Washington Bureau of McClatchy Newspapers. She has written 
four books. Excerpted by permission from I Should Have Stayed Home (Book 
Passage Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The late President Lyndon B. Johnson rarely missed a funeral, no matter how 
far he had to go. And where the President of the United States goes, the White 
House press corps, which has on occasion been mistaken for the cast of "The 
Night of the Living Dead," follows. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most memorably awful of LBJ's travels was the time he went to the 
funeral of Australian Prime Minister Harold Holt, who had disappeared during a 
fishing trip around Christmas of 1967 and was presumed drowned. Many people 
believed he'd been eaten by a shark. Johnson decided he was going to Australia 
for the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House travel office swung into action with the efficiency for which 
it was known in those days. About a hundred reporters, photographers and 
television technicians signed up, a plane was chartered for the press, and we 
were told that we needed five shots, for everything from cholera to tetanus, 
before we left the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, I was a White House correspondent for the Baltimore Sun, so I was 
in the lineup of reporters assembled in the White House press room to get three 
shots in one arm and two in the other. 
</P>
<P>
 The five shots began to take effect as the press embarked on what was supposed 
to be a 48-hour trip to Australia and back. I was seated next to Frank Cormier 
of the Associated Press, who was running a fever, and alternately requesting 
blankets and gin. This was before the days when reporters drank mineral water 
and communed chiefly with computers. 
</P>
<P>
 What we didn't know -- I doubt that LBJ even knew, because he never made his 
mind up until the last minute -- was that we were going around the world in 
about four days, most of it in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way to Australia, we stopped to refuel in Hawaii in the midst of a 
tropical downpour. Only the President and I were given umbrellas. He got one 
because of who he was and I got one because I was the only female reporter on 
the press plane. This was also in the days when the White House press corps was 
98% male. By the time I got back on board, my drenched colleagues almost 
without exception had taken off their pants and wound blankets around 
themselves. The entire plane was draped with dripping trousers and smelled like 
a steam laundry. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the way to Australia, we discovered that Dan Rather, then the CBS 
White House correspondent, liked to sleep under the seat. He negotiated with 
sitting occupants not to put their feet on his face then wrapped himself 
mummy-like in a blanket and stretched out below three rows of seats. It was 
unnerving until you got used to the idea, and what was most exasperating about 
it was that he would emerge without a hair out of place or a wrinkle on his 
shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Canberra was notable for the fact that it was the only time in 3 1/2 days that 
we slept in hotel beds. The rest of the time, we sprawled across each other in 
the plane as it whipped around the globe in the Presidential wake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Holt funeral was the only planned event, and characteristically LBJ took 
the opportunity to stage a series of one-on-one meetings with prime ministers 
from Britain, New Zealand and Singapore. He even got together with Harold 
Holt's grandson, and paid quite a lot of attention to Imelda Marcos, who was a 
very good looking woman in those days. We watched and noted and wrote and began 
to worry about the rumors that we wouldn't be home for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 The rumors proved to be true. The Presidential entourage, trailed by the weary 
press, took off for what turned out to be Khorat Air Force Base in Thailand, 
where we discovered flying cockroaches and watched the President listen to 
pilots talk about the air war in Vietnam. It was then we had our first 
casualty. A photographer was carried off suffering from exhaustion and followed 
by several envious glances. 
</P>
<P>
 We soon learned that Vietnam was our next destination. A screen was put up at 
the back of the press plane so the press corps could receive hepatitis shots in 
its collective rear end. By dawn we arrived at the American base at Cam Ranh 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 LBJ was just hitting his stride. It had apparently occurred to him this trip 
was a good opportunity to traverse the globe. He also had a bedroom on Air 
Force One and was doing a good deal better than the press was. We had a 
full-time medic aboard by that time, ministering to high temperatures and 
swollen arms. 
</P>
<P>
 We never saw our bags after we left Australia because we didn't stop anywhere 
long enough for them to unpack the plane. This was the trip where I learned the 
value of a flight bag containing an extra sweater and underwear. 
</P>
<P>
 We never saw anything because we invariably touched down at night, and even 
filing stories was difficult. We had to use local telephones, which meant 
taking hours to send stories.  
</P>
<P>
 We flew from Vietnam to Pakistan, where another photographer was carried off 
the plane on a stretcher, suffering from a heart attack. We were worried about 
him, but his absence meant there was another seat to sleep on. 
</P>
<P>
 From Pakistan, we flew to Rome where the President of Italy and the Pope were 
waiting and Marine One, the presidential helicopter, tore up the Vatican lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Rome was our last stop. We went home on Christmas Eve via Ireland where the 
press plane stopped at the Shannon Airport to refuel and also let the press do 
its Christmas shopping.  
</P>
<P>
 The White House gave each of us a photo album as a souvenir. It was full of 
glossy color shots of LBJ pumping hands and hugging people. It was billed as 
"First Presidential Around-the-World Trip." And it lived up to Johnson's 
campaign motto: "All the way with LBJ." 
</P>
<P>
 I had brought home some souvenirs as well. I still had bumps and bruises all 
over my body from groping up and down the aisle of the press plane.  
</P>
<P>
 But I was grateful to LBJ. Within four days, I had dropped from a Size 10 to a 
Size 8.

TRAVEL HORRORS: INDONESIA; A BAD BARGAIN IN BALI; OBLIVIOUS AMERICAN ON A 
SHOPPING EXPEDITION ENDS UP WITH CULTURAL EGG ON HIS FACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS E. K. CERRUTI, Cerruti is a lawyer and free-lance writer who has just 
completed his first novel. He divides his time between Salt Lake City, Carmel 
and Sante Fe. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I left the comforts of my lounge chair on the sands of Sanur Beach in Bali to 
go on a shopping trip. Later, I wished I had not. 
</P>
<P>
 An Australian couple I'd met on the beach had raved about a factory that sold 
batik and brocade, and since I was in the middle of a redecorating project back 
home, it sounded intriguing. Little did I know that this outing and, I confess, 
my brash American sensibilities were going to cause me so much embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, the driver I had used for the preceding week was available that 
afternoon to take me into the nearby crowded city of Denpasar, where he found 
the location of the recommended fabric factory without much trouble. While he 
waited with the car at the curb, I walked toward the archway framing what 
looked vaguely like some sort of mini-mall. Buildings were on either side of a 
flower-filled courtyard. Although there was no sign to identify it and its 
entrance was nondescript, a small shop on the right was the showroom for the 
factory. 
</P>
<P>
 It took little time to realize that nothing in the shop's meager selection 
interested me. But as I turned to leave, lamenting my bad luck at coming all 
this way only to leave empty-handed, I spotted something interesting through a 
shop window across the courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
 I walked over and peered through the large window. Inside were beautiful 
antiques, both Balinese and European, Oriental rugs and a display case 
containing what looked like Ming blue and white porcelain, which I had just 
begun to collect. What a lovely shop, I thought, as I opened the door and 
crossed the threshold. And how typical of life, I happily philosophized, that 
when one door closes (the bad tip on the fabric factory) another opens. 
</P>
<P>
 As I entered the little foyer, a young boy who had been lounging on an 
elaborately carved daybed, jumped to his feet and ran out of the room, 
obviously going to get the proprietor. While waiting, I walked into the large 
room where the boy had been, and over to the glass-front cabinet that had 
caught my eye from the window. 
</P>
<P>
 Displayed within were a number of beautiful and fine Ming porcelain pieces, 
other blue and white dishes and assorted antique Chinese and Dutch wares. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, I remembered, Bali and the rest of Indonesia had been part of 
Holland's colonial empire. Hence the Dutch china and odd pieces of European 
furniture. The selection of porcelain was truly a find. I curbed my impulse to 
open the cabinet and check the prices, which was just as well since the young 
boy had quickly returned with a woman who appeared to be his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 I've found the Balinese people to be quiet and serene, unlike Americans, such 
as I, who so often have our eyes out for good prices and our instincts poised 
for a little old-fashioned bargaining, which I was prepared to do that day. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's mother demurely approached, and I smiled and pointed at the display 
cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much?" I asked, pointing to a particularly nice piece. The woman looked 
confused. "Do you mind if I take a look at these? What are your prices like?" 
</P>
<P>
 The woman shook her head slightly, which was when I realized that she didn't 
quite comprehend what I was saying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Collection," was the only response she could muster. Well, I wasn't prepared 
to buy all the porcelain as one lot, and it was clear that the woman didn't 
speak English. I figured that we would need an interpreter if any business 
transactions were going to be done. So I held my hand up and said, "One second, 
I'll get my driver to interpret." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, I gestured to the driver to come into the store. I asked him to 
explain to the woman that I was interested in the porcelain and, in particular, 
a piece on a middle shelf of the cabinet. It was then that I opened the cabinet 
door and took the plate from its display stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ask her what she wants for this," I instructed the driver. He turned to her 
and spoke in Balinese. 
</P>
<P>
 After she responded to him, the driver turned to me (I was still holding the 
plate I was interested in) and cleared his throat. "Sir," he said in his 
inimically kind and polite voice. "This is a private home." 
</P>
<P>
 As best I could, I masked my shock and mortification, returned the plate and 
made a sincere apology. 
</P>
<P>
 I then got out of there in a hurry, empty-handed again. I told the driver that 
we were through shopping for the day, and we headed back to the hotel.

HOW STEWART BRAND LEARNS; HE CREATED THE WHOLE EARTH CATALOG AND POPULARIZED 
THE PERSONAL COMPUTER. FOR 25 YEARS, THIS WRITER-GADFLY-FUTURIST HAS REINVENTED 
HIMSELF -- AND SHAPED HOW WE LIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Katherine Fulton, Katherine Fulton, founding editor of the North Carolina 
Independent, currently teaches media technology at the Sanford Institute of 
Public Policy at Duke University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She didn't even get his name right. Not that it mattered. He was just another 
'60s oddball "with a face that looks like an embodied question mark" -- a 
skinny 27-year-old who had attracted a crowd outside the main gate of Columbia 
University. According to Sally Kempton's 1966 Village Voice article, he wore "a 
black top hat decorated with a flower, and a sandwich board decorated with the 
question: 'Why haven't we seen a photograph of the whole Earth yet?' " The 
buttons he was hawking asked the same question. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'What would happen if we did have a picture?' a girl asked. 'Would it 
eliminate slums, or meanness, or anything?' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Maybe not,' said Stuart Brand, 'but it might tell us something about 
ourselves.' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'What?' asked the girl. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'It might tell us where we're at,' said Brand. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'What for?' asked the girl. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Why do you look in the mirror?' asked Brand. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Oh,' said the girl, and bought a button." 
</P>
<P>
 Kempton was amused, but not curious enough to ask NASA why, after eight years 
of space exploration, the agency still hadn't publicly released a photograph of 
what Brand called "the whole Earth." She couldn't imagine that the photo would 
eventually become one of the most important icons of our time, would help 
launch the environmental movement or would grace the bestseller that Brand 
himself would edit five years later. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, it's easy to underestimate Brand. Editor, writer, consultant, gadfly 
and futurist, he is difficult to categorize. Mitchell Kapor, founder of Lotus 
and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, describes him as "a great inventor in 
the realm of ideas." Brand's most famous idea, of course, was the "Whole Earth 
Catalog," one of the most lasting emblems and contributions of the 
counterculture. Modeled on the Sears and L. L. Bean mail-order catalogues, it 
was a bursting-at-the seams compendium of book reviews, tool recommendations, 
personal testaments and illustrations, all held together by Brand's aphorisms 
and abiding faith in self-education. Aimed initially at commune dwellers, the 
first major edition sold nearly a million copies and went on to win the 
National Book Award for Contemporary Affairs in 1972. There have been five 
major editions since. The newest, "The Millennium Whole Earth Catalog," edited 
by Howard Rheingold, with a foreword by Brand, will be in bookstores by 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthropologist Mary Catherine Bateson says that Brand has brought so many 
different kinds of people -- scientists and artists, businessmen and 
intellectuals -- into conversations with one another that he is "one of the 
pivotal people over the last few decades." Brand as an intellectual community 
organizer is an appealing notion. Since his days hawking buttons, he has 
believed that to change the world it is necessary to connect people across 
conventional disciplines and boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 That was certainly the idea behind CoEvolution Quarterly, the magazine he 
edited for more than 10 years as a personal think tank. In its pages, Gregory 
Bateson argued with his ex-wife Margaret Mead about cybernetics, and such 
disparate figures as entrepreneur Paul Hawken, naturalist Wendell Berry, 
medical self-help advocate Tom Ferguson and poet Gary Snyder all commingled. 
The same principle applied to the Global Business Network, the company that 
Brand helped found six years ago, and to the WELL, the teleconferencing system 
that has since become a seminal institution of cyberspace, which Brand started 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 It's entirely consistent that Brand discovered personal computers -- another 
powerful tool for connecting people -- before almost everyone except the people 
who invented them. In 1972, he wrote a piece for Rolling Stone that both 
anticipated and championed the coming computer revolution. His book on 
interactive, multimedia technologies, "The Media Lab: Inventing the Future at 
MIT," was published in 1987 to a great deal less acclaim than it might have 
received a few years later, when the information superhighway became a hot 
idea. But then, by the time Brand's ideas spread, he's usually onto something 
else. He's so far ahead of the curve, it's easy to forget that he's often been 
there first. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Kelly, executive editor of Wired magazine, thinks of Brand as an 
educator. "Stewart is primarily concerned about improving his own skills at 
learning, then trying to teach everyone else how to learn, then trying to 
institute a learning process into society as a whole." That's an accurate 
description of Brand's most recent project, "How Buildings Learn: What Happens 
After They're Built." Published this summer, the book is ostensibly a history 
of architecture and design, but its real subject is how humans evolve and adapt 
-- how not only buildings, but people, learn over time. Like "The Media Lab," 
Brand's book has been almost completely overlooked in the intellectual press, 
even though urban historian Jane Jacobs declares it "a classic and probably a 
work of genius." 
</P>
<P>
 Being underestimated may be Brand's fate. After all, creating communities or 
anticipating cultural revolutions long before they occur are by their nature 
invisible work -- the background, it seems, is Brand's natural haven. "When all 
the noisy people wear themselves out talking," says computer industry analyst 
Esther Dyson, "then Stewart says the one thing that's really true. He doesn't 
shout. He waits for a silent moment. Then he says the one thing you remember." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart Brand said he would be easy to find: He'd be the one in the fishing 
boat in the middle of the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Brand has lived and worked in Sausalito for more than two decades. When I 
arrive, he is squeezed behind a small desk in the stern of the landlocked 
fishing boat he uses as an office. He's talking on a telephone designed to 
clarify sounds; to his great irritation, his hearing has begun to deteriorate. 
Now 55, mostly bald but still lanky, Brand is a walking advertisement for the 
kinds of tools that the "Whole Earth Catalog" has always championed.  
</P>
<P>
 Tools is a word that has an elastic, almost-mystical meaning for Brand, one 
that he applies to everything from hacksaws to trench coats to history itself. 
As he declares in his introduction to the new edition of the catalogue: "Here 
are the tools to make your life go better. And to make the world go better. 
That they're the same tools is our theory of civilization." 
</P>
<P>
 On this day, his tools include worn blue Levi's 501s and a dark-blue work 
shirt from Patagonia. On his belt hang pouches for a monocular, the largest 
Swiss army knife made, and an extremely sharp dendritic-steel sheath knife. His 
shoes are French black-leather sneakers ("the snootiest of the comfortable 
shoes"), his shoulder bag is made of hemp, his glasses are designed with 
spring-loaded bows and nosepiece so that they're more durable. He wears a 
plain, black Swatch watch, with day and date. ("I hate digital watches -- they 
give me more information than I want.") In his shirt pocket are a ballpoint pen 
that keeps the ink under pressure so he can use it lying down, and a leather 
envelope that holds monogrammed 3-by-5-inch cards. Three of the cards are 
covered front and back with lists of books he's looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything, it seems, is "sturdy and robust," adjectives he often uses to 
describe objects he admires. Everything, that is, except the fishing boat 
itself, which is rotting away. But it has light on four sides, and, he says, 
"absolutely nobody cares what I do with any of it." When he needed to make a 
place for a fax, he took a saber saw and cut a hole for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Brand reserves Wednesdays to travel across the bay to Emeryville, the 
industrial district at the foot of Berkeley where the Global Business Network 
is located. GBN, as everyone calls it, has been his principal employer since 
the late 1980s, when he and four others established the business to help 
organizations get ready for the future. (He works one other day a week at what 
may be the most closely watched new technology lab, Interval Research Corp. in 
Palo Alto, funded by Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft.) 
</P>
<P>
 As we enter the GBN building, the staff is hanging a large, colorful 
reproduction of an old map depicting the "Isle of California" as the first 
explorers envisioned it. Besides provoking the obvious chuckles about how the 
rest of the country really does see California as an island, the map also has a 
serious purpose: to remind clients that clinging to a wrong mental map of the 
future can lead one badly astray. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Schwartz, the GBN founder who has most shaped the company, bounds over 
to greet us. He and Brand have known each other for nearly 20 years, a 
friendship marked -- as so many of Brand's are -- by long conversation and an 
intense exchange of ideas. Schwartz has just returned from the Pentagon, where, 
he reports excitedly, top defense planners are reading his book "The Art of the 
Long View." He is coaching the department to produce something other than the 
familiar best-case, worst-case scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
 The GBN Method, developed at Royal Dutch/Shell Group, where Schwartz worked 
for five years, looks both at forces that can be safely predicted (the teen-age 
population in the year 2000, say, or the ongoing demand for oil) and events 
that cannot (the emergence of rap, or an Arab oil embargo). The end product 
weaves together a set of narratives designed to surprise leaders into 
re-examining their assumptions and preparing them to react quickly as the 
actual future unfolds. GBN's clients include the National Education Assn., the 
Mott Foundation, Arco, Volvo, BellSouth, IBM, Metropolitan Life and Sears. 
Corporations pay $35,000 a year to be part of the GBN "network," and 
considerably more for specific consultations. 
</P>
<P>
 Brand contributes to the scenarios and moderates GBN's private conference on 
the WELL. But his main work at GBN stands before us at the building's entrance: 
a tall bookshelf that holds all the books, articles, CDs, journals and software 
that Brand has sent to GBN's clients and members, at the rate of two a month, 
for the last six years. The GBN Book Club allows him to search for the 
"intellectual tools for the years ahead," just as he did when he edited the 
catalogue and CoEvolution Quarterly. The titles are typically catholic. Among 
them: "The Discoverers," by Daniel Boorstin, which Brand calls "the most 
inspiring human history I know"; "Myst," the CD-Rom adventure game whose 
multiple story lines, he believes, show how the computer is changing 
traditional narrative, and "Complexity: The Emerging Science at the Edge of 
Order and Chaos," by Mitchell Waldrop, the story of the "complex systems" 
research going on at Santa Fe Institute, where Brand is a director. 
</P>
<P>
 Brand also helps select the individuals who are invited to join GBN for free. 
Now numbering about 90, they are as eclectic as the books, ranging from 
performance artist Laurie Anderson to Harvard business professor Michael 
Porter, from neurobiologist Francisco Varela to Pepsi-Cola International Vice 
President Mia de Kuijper . 
</P>
<P>
 GBN, Brand explains, is unashamedly elitist. "I think elites basically drive 
civilization. They are the innovation sources and the places where continuity 
happens, and they're good things. The answer to the problems of elites is not 
to get rid of elites but to have more elites, where everybody has got a few. 
They've got to be open at the bottom, or they die." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some of the other elites Brand has been part of, this one generates $4 
million a year in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The GBN staff gathers in a light, open two-story common room for its weekly 
meeting. Brand himself has designed the space. Glassed-in offices and open 
railings give everyone visual access to the whole organization, but staff 
members have what Brand calls "aural privacy" so that they can work in peace. A 
dozen or so people pull comfortable chairs into a large circle. Predominantly 
white, about half female, there are lots of jeans in the room and no ties. 
</P>
<P>
 It all feels loose but businesslike as the staffers begin their reports: Xerox 
has joined the network; British rock musician Peter Gabriel, a longtime member, 
was on David Letterman the night before, and the future-of-African-Americans 
project is proceeding. Schwartz is excited about the scenario work done at the 
natural-gas division of Texaco, where GBN has been consulting long enough to 
begin to see results. And on a nude beach at Martha's Vineyard, he ran into 
Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, who's on the O. J. Simpson defense team. 
</P>
<P>
 When it's Brand's turn to speak, he leaps to his feet, strips off his 
long-sleeved shirt and reveals his summer vacation purchase -- a Martha's 
Vineyard Black Dog T-shirt. I had been told by many people that Brand is not a 
great public speaker -- a surprising observation about a man who spends so much 
of his time communicating -- but that he is a terrific conversationalist. His 
report bears this out. He has an exuberant laugh. His grin is a bit goofy, it's 
so big. He almost would seem boyish if he wasn't six feet. Instead, he seems 
polite, a little stiff and wary. When he pauses to think, which is often, he 
closes his deep-blue eyes, scrunches up his long face and takes a deep breath, 
letting it out audibly. His face ends up looking like one of the computer 
networks he ceaselessly promotes; it becomes a web of connected lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Martha's Vineyard is a cult," he begins, and then proceeds to give an 
unlikely but illuminating anthropological description of the island resort. It 
has, he says, "studied and variegated towns, with an Italian city-state 
quality. Everything grows to 30 feet and stops." That fact, combined with the 
little cottages, gives "a two-thirds scale to everything. It's quite romantic 
and endearing." 
</P>
<P>
 It is, I come to realize, a classic Brand discourse, exact in its description 
and startling in its connections and imaginative leaps (who else would compare 
the Vineyard to Florence?). It's a brilliant description that doesn't feel that 
way. It's just ordinary -- with maybe a hint of arrogance, but little 
self-importance -- which, Mary Catherine Bateson, an old friend, says is how 
Brand manages to influence people without being an imposing presence. "You 
never hear pronouncements from Stewart," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Bateson remembers that her father, anthropologist Gregory Bateson, once 
organized a conference and invited Brand to give a lecture. "Stewart walked in 
and said, 'What do you want to ask me?' Stewart's thinking is reactive and 
interactive. He gets hold of a question and involves other people in talking 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, what makes Brand one of the central figures in the new media is that 
his "inventions" (another favorite word of his) encourage people to talk to one 
another, creating a community where one didn't exist before. The "Whole Earth 
Catalog" invited its readers to write in with suggestions, ideas and reviews -- 
in effect giving a podium to anyone smart enough to use it, and making it 
possible for people to teach each other what they know. The WELL serves 
precisely the same function, but is capable of doing it every day of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the morning, when I get a private moment with Schwartz, he offers 
another example of how Brand operates. The setting was a big workshop on the 
future of communications, held six years ago. The people from AT&T, Schwartz 
recalls, "could not imagine that the source of innovation, the challenge, the 
threat to them would come from lots of small companies." But Brand just kept 
asking questions, coming back at them, trying to get them to identify their 
assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'Look, the first e-mail system that the country is going to have is 
not going to be AT&T. It's going to be the Internet.' And they said, 'You're 
out of your mind. How could that be? It's a kludgy little thing. Nothing like 
our big robust network.' And he said, 'Yeah, but it's the people who are using 
it who are building it, and they have a profound commitment to it. You're going 
to wait around 10 or 15 years to figure out the optimal system. Meanwhile, 
these guys are actually out there building it right now. And what you're going 
to have to do is figure out how to cope with the Internet once it's up and 
running." 
</P>
<P>
 Brand, says Schwartz, is often right, as he was in this case. He's also been 
wrongheaded or a little wacky. His enthusiasms have included geodesic domes 
(they leak, it turns out) and the political efficacy of the Black Panthers. 
He's campaigned for space colonies and against the metric system. Always, 
though, his method is the same. He's a contrarian who sees things that others 
miss because he loves going against the grain. Brand says he was born a crank. 
Those who have known his family for a long time joke that if you throw a Brand 
in the river, he'll float upstream. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of Stewart Brand's most vivid memories is that of a nightmare. "There was 
chaos, and then I looked around and I was the only person left alive in 
Rockford, Ill., a knee-high creature." This was the early 1950s. Brand had 
entered adolescence, and his hometown, a major machine-tool manufacturing 
center, had just been placed number seven on a list of most likely targets for 
Soviet nuclear attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Brand's public reputation has been wedded to the '60s, he is a 
product of the '50s. "The impulse was, 'How do I get out of here?' 'Cause 
'here' was so predictable and boring." Brand never felt at home, he says, until 
he hit North Beach in San Francisco and discovered the Beats. "They were the 
intelligent outlaws. You would walk down Grant Avenue and you'd hear jazz, and 
it wasn't coming from a nightclub. It was coming from somebody's basement, and 
you'd go sit in the alley and have some hot French bread, right out of the 
oven, and listen to these guys doing timeless jazz improvising into the dawn. 
That ain't bad." North Beach had bitten him. California would become his 
"native land, because there's much less asking for permission." 
</P>
<P>
 I look at Brand now, so straight and proper -- "a balding L. L. Bean" was my 
favorite characterization -- and I am reminded that he always had a complicated 
relationship to the '60s. He had attended two of America's most elite 
educational institutions, Phillips Exeter Academy and Stanford. He had admired 
the loggers he worked with during summers ("They know a hell of a lot more 
about the woods than your standard urban environmentalist") and had thought he 
wanted a Ph.D in forest firefighting. A stint in the Army, training to be a 
paratrooper, left him with a respect for military culture that he retains to 
this day. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet once out of the Army, he started a campaign called America Needs Indians, 
joined Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters, experimented with drugs and found himself 
driving a pickup truck in the San Francisco hills, with Tom Wolfe bouncing 
around in the back, memorizing the scene for the opening of his classic 1960s 
tale, "The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test." 
</P>
<P>
 Brand hardly drinks alcohol now, much less takes drugs. "I was always this 
sort of fringe conservative Prankster," he explains. "I was always seen as the 
kind of responsible one, or something." Indeed, it was a 27-year-old Stewart 
Brand who stayed straight long enough to organize and run the famous 1966 Trips 
Festival in San Francisco, which was meant to simulate what it felt like to be 
on psychedelic drugs. The whole thing, Brand says, was risky, physically 
dangerous -- and alive. "(That) raggedy edge," he says, "once you've tasted it, 
nothing else tastes as tart." 
</P>
<P>
 Strip away the element of danger and the Trips Festival begins to look a lot 
like Brand's other media innovations, the "Whole Earth Catalog" and the WELL, 
both of which follow the same recipe: "Toss interesting people in the pot and 
turn up the flame, then dive in." The festival was the moment that hippie 
culture discovered it was actually a mass phenomenon. Some also claim that it 
was the first large-scale rock concert-cum-light show ever staged. Without 
question, it launched the most successful American band in pop history, the 
Grateful Dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Brand's 1960s were not about politics, though. When he was an Army 
photographer, he had wanted to go to Vietnam, he says, but "I didn't want to go 
fight. I wanted to go see it. And since I couldn't go to see it, I didn't 
believe anything I heard about it. And I knew that the New Left calling 
soldiers baby-killers was deep bulls - - -." There was no war protesting or 
civil rights marching. Instead, Brand found his home in a quite different 
subculture of the counterculture -- in the world of computer hackers and their 
rebellion against central processing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime in the early 1960s -- he thinks it was 1963 -- Brand went to the 
Stanford computer center to watch "young obsessed-seeming people, all males 
then, who were out of their bodies, locked in a virtual combat in real time, 
which we didn't know to call it then, with other people who were out of their 
bodies in the same place." They were playing the first computer game, called 
"Space War." 
</P>
<P>
 These young men had found a way "out of here" that Brand immediately 
identified with. His father, an MIT-trained engineer, ran an advertising agency 
and was a devoted ham radio operator. Long before Sputnik, Stewart Brand says, 
his mother was a space-travel enthusiast. So when he first encountered 
computers, he never saw them as a threat, as did others of his generation. 
"Ready or not, computers are coming to the people," he wrote in Rolling Stone 
in 1972. "That's good news, maybe the best since psychedelics." 
</P>
<P>
 That article, later republished in his book "Two Cybernetic Frontiers," proved 
to be remarkably prescient. He understood that both scientists and hackers were 
inventing personal computers. He spotted how much fun computers could be, how 
much of computer development would be driven by impassioned improvisation and 
how computers could be used as communication devices and a means of creative 
expression. And he was thrilled with what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology had the potential to transform the culture, and the people 
making computers would be the most successful carriers of the counterculture's 
values of decentralization and self-help. That would be his consistent message 
as he continued to write about computers in the "Whole Earth Catalog," in 
CoEvolution Quarterly and eventually in "The Media Lab." By everyone's account, 
Brand popularized the notion that the computer was a tool for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Kay, now a Fellow at Apple Computers, Inc., was one of the main 
characters in Brand's Rolling Stone story. He was then a scientist at the 
original Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center), which was developing many of 
the innovations that would lead to the personal computer. "For us at PARC, he 
was the guy who was giving us the early warning system about what computers 
were going to be," says Kay, "and I'm not even sure he knew it." 
</P>
<P>
 Xerox PARC was full of fans of the "Whole Earth Catalog," which maintained a 
nearby store to sell the products it reviewed. Books the catalogue had 
recommended filled the first PARC library. The catalogue, Kay says, taught him 
to think of the computer as a tool for accessing resources. Brand understood 
that "the destiny of things was to be connected together. That's when you 
become educated and powerful." And the destiny of computers, Kay and others 
came to believe, was to be connected. "Catalysts make reactions happen faster. 
Stewart was one of the major intellectual catalysts of the late '60s and early 
'70s." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Brand's role as catalyst didn't abate. When Steven Levy published 
his 1984 book "Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution," Brand and his 
protege Kevin Kelly realized that the three generations of inventors in Levy's 
book had never met one another. They decided to organize the first Hackers 
Conference, and the result was a legendary event that became an annual 
institution. Once again, Brand did what he does best. "The hacker community 
became conscious of who they were," says Levy. "Links were made that flowered 
over the years." 
</P>
<P>
 That same year Brand created what would become one of his most important 
successes -- the WELL (the Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link). A few years earlier he 
had been given one of the original small Kaypro computers to teach an 
experimental class over telephone lines, and he learned that communication 
could be effective when people are not in the same place at the same time. The 
problem was that it was expensive. So Brand, the former Merry Prankster, 
thought it would be fun to try a different experiment -- a cheap 
teleconferencing system that would be shaped by the people who used it. He 
decided that users would "own their own words" and could set up discussion 
groups on any topic, from parenting to technology itself. The idea caught fire. 
(In a wonderful historic irony, the WELL's early success was due in part to its 
passionate use by Grateful Dead fans.) 
</P>
<P>
 The WELL "pioneered the idea of virtual community," says his friend Mitch 
Kapor. It soon became the equivalent of a cafe where technologically savvy 
people hung out, whether they were hackers, civil libertarians or FBI agents. 
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the policy and advocacy organization 
that Kapor now leads, got started as a conference on the WELL, as a place to 
talk about the social issues new technologies raise. (When EFF became an 
organization, Brand became one of its first board members.) 
</P>
<P>
 The WELL's success coincided with Brand's most spectacular failure -- the 1984 
publication of a "Whole Earth Software Catalog." He had received what at the 
time was the largest advance ever paid for a computer book, $1.3 million. But 
software, it turned out, had to be reviewed a lot more frequently than the 
catalogue schedule allowed, and the book quickly became obsolete. Brand had 
broken one of his own cardinal rules. Unlike the WELL, the software catalogue 
was not "self-enhancing. It had no way to correct." There was, in other words, 
no way to debug it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Just how Stewart Brand came to spend much of the past six years studying not 
computers, but buildings, reveals a great deal about how his mind works. 
</P>
<P>
 The software catalogue had failed, the WELL had been launched, CoEvolution 
Quarterly had gained a new name ("Whole Earth Review") and a new editor (Kevin 
Kelly), and Brand was headed to Africa for a sabbatical. On the way, he stopped 
in Venice, and found himself looking up at the dome of St. Mark's Basilica, 
stunned by its Asiatic mosaics. "It was an aesthetic overwhelm and a great, 
jarring, thrilling event where you just go, 'Holy s- - -, I have no idea what's 
going on here.' " He decided to learn everything he could about Venetian 
history and to study the city's complex systems that controlled food 
distribution, electricity, transportation, politics and more. He discovered "an 
intensely adaptive organization which could turn on a dime. The 800 years of 
the Venetian republic is the classic case of a culture living on the razor's 
edge, century after century." 
</P>
<P>
 Once in Africa, he started spinning fantasies of the books he could write 
about Venice, eventually deciding that it ought to be a fiction series. On the 
way back to the United States, he stopped in London and dropped in on his 
friend Peter Schwartz. Brand's interest in how complex systems evolve matched 
the work that Schwartz was doing at Shell on how organizations learn. So they 
dreamed up a project to start a dialogue between intellectuals and business 
people. Corporations would sponsor the conversations, and Brand would 
orchestrate them. They were called the Learning Conferences, and both GBN and 
"How Buildings Learn" eventually grew out of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Brand had been searching for a way to write about learning through time. When 
he shifted his gaze from Venice to buildings themselves, he knew he had hit 
upon a "genuine scoop of some depth and relevance. I think it really is new, 
true, important and well-written, which are the criteria of why you publish 
something or don't that I work with. It's the most thoroughly realized thing 
I've ever done." 
</P>
<P>
 "How Buildings Learn" is the best single summary of Brand's thought. It's hard 
to imagine that anyone else could have written it. Not only did he use all the 
skills he developed at the catalogue -- distilling ideas into aphorisms, making 
connections among disparate disciplines, liberally employing images to make his 
case. But the book also gave him a focused way to do the intellectual work he 
excels at: To Brand, the book was a scientific endeavor, a chance to study and 
categorize organisms -- in this case, buildings -- that appear to be permanent 
but are actually continually changing. Which allows him to talk indirectly 
about institutional and cultural adaptivity of all kinds -- how any human 
system, whether it's Venice or a tiny bungalow, moves from here to there. 
</P>
<P>
 The path that buildings take through time, not the space they inhabit, is 
Brand's concern. "A building is not something you finish," he writes. "A 
building is something you start." Brand exhorts architects to enable people to 
shape buildings to their own needs, regardless of the architect's original 
intentions. This, of course, is one of the primary ideas he has been 
communicating in various forms for 25 years -- that individuals must have the 
tools and the freedom to adapt as they see fit. "Unmake victims," he wrote in 
the 1980 edition of the "Whole Earth Catalog." "Start with yourself, branch out 
from there." That was vintage Brand, though not quite as memorable as his most 
famous catalogue rallying cry, which had the same message: "We are as gods and 
might as well get good at it." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Brand who studied biology and ecology at Stanford in the late 1950s 
and learned about cybernetics from Gregory Bateson in the 1970s knows that 
relationships are as important as autonomy. Every building, as every 
individual, is part of a complex system that nobody controls. People shape 
buildings, and buildings shape people. 
</P>
<P>
 This idea is so pivotal to Brand that he named a magazine after it. In his 
introduction to the first issue of CoEvolution Quarterly, he wrote: "It seems 
that all evolution is coevolution. . . . Language such as 'preserving the 
ecology' suggests something quite perfect -- static, knowable, oriented 
backward, unwelcoming to human foolishness . . . unreal. Ecology is whole 
system alright, but coevolution is whole system in TIME. The health of it is 
forward -- systemic self-education which feeds on constant imperfection. We 
coevolving watchers and meddlers are not left out of it. Ecology maintains. 
Coevolution learns." 
</P>
<P>
 Brand's belief in the biological metaphor is total, and he thinks he's 
succeeded in convincing some businesses to embrace it, rather than the old 
sports and military metaphors of winning and conquering. "You see the term 
coevolution all through business texts now," he says. Businesses are "shaped by 
relationships. It helps them realize that often competition is just a funny 
form of collaboration." 
</P>
<P>
 Biology informs Brand's next project. He and Peter Schwartz have a contract to 
write a book called "Biofutures" that will examine the race between between 
biotechnology and nanotechnology (the engineering of molecular material). 
"Whichever becomes profoundly effective first," Brand says, "will influence 
everything else, more even than information technology has." 
</P>
<P>
 After many hours talking with Brand, I am beginning to understand why he 
doesn't fit the stereotype of '60s radical he's so often assigned. He was 
always counter-counterculture -- a short-haired Darwinian biologist who 
believed in small business and had little interest in ideology or politics. 
"The sorting of complex issues into Democrat and Republican infuriates me," he 
says. (He did, however, put in a stint as a part-time consultant to a 
politician who also defied labels, former California Gov. Jerry Brown.) 
</P>
<P>
 The sharpest criticism leveled at Brand is that he never addresses whole 
political and economic systems that limit the power of any one individual -- 
especially individuals who are not white and male. Herbert Chao Gunther, 
president of the San Francisco-based Public Media Center, the only nonprofit 
public-interest advertising agency in the country, says that Brand and his 
cohort are guilty of "escapist intellectualism." They are, he says, "people on 
a lifeboat fundamentally blind to the people drowning in the ocean. They are 
alienated from the unhappy work of making a democracy." In other words, Brand 
is naive about the difference his beloved tools can make and doesn't understand 
what's required to change a world dominated by intrusive governments and 
ever-expanding corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 He would answer that it is naive to try to reinvent the world from the top 
down. When pushed, he calls himself conservative or an optimistic fatalist. 
"It's probably the difference between evolutionary and visionary," he explains. 
"Evolutionary is backward-looking with accuracy. Visionary is forward-looking 
with eyes filled with folly. I think all utopias are dystopias. Utopia is the 
opposite of laying down a path by walking. It's a spelling out in exhaustive 
and boring detail where one is gonna get to, and there's no way that can work. 
It's always deadly." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Brand turned 50 a few years back, he allowed no toasts or other 
sentimental gestures from the 100 friends who gathered for the party thrown by 
his second wife, Patty Phelan. He doesn't learn anything from praise, he says, 
and introspection seems self-indulgent. For all his love of conversation, he 
remains an essentially private man. "Stewart is not self-revelatory," says Mary 
Catherine Bateson. "I've rarely heard Stewart start a sentence, 'I feel.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Where he does reveal himself is in his habitat. Next to his houseboat office 
is a storage yard consisting of 30 shipping containers that usually sit on the 
back of tractor-trailers. Brand rents two for a total of $500 a month; one is 
for storage, the other houses the library where he put together "How Buildings 
Learn." 
</P>
<P>
 The steel 8-by-8-by-40-foot container has long work tables, 3 1/2 feet high 
and 2 feet deep, with shelves above within easy reach and plenty of storage 
space below. Above the work tables is a wall-length sheet-metal bulletin board; 
to hold things up, he uses magnets, which he then can slide around. It's a "low 
road" building, his favorite kind, which means low rent, little style and easy 
to change. "People asked, 'How can you stand it in there without windows?' " he 
writes in the buildings book. "All I could say was, 'A library doesn't need 
windows. A library is a window.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On the right wall just as we enter is a group of photographs: Winston 
Churchill on the deck of a warship, cigar in mouth; Churchill standing in his 
study, learning over a book holder; Churchill on his own roof, hammering. This 
is Brand's "Churchill shrine." He's been reading about Churchill for about five 
years and even belongs to the International Churchill Society so he can get its 
quarterly magazine. "I got very interested in the whole concept of good 
judgment, and Churchill's quality of judgment is so often superb." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprising, Brand's favorite hobby is reading. He's got a whole shelf on 
Venice, another of T. E. Lawrence, another of Nabokov. He usually keeps three 
or four books going at a time -- the ones he reads for pleasure, in the 
evenings. This doesn't include the ones he skims for GBN during the days. 
</P>
<P>
 Everywhere you look in the container, there are photographs, maps, posters -- 
things that Brand can see, because nothing seems to impress him more than 
visual reality. On the worktable, just at the entrance, are the boxes of note 
cards that Brand has used to organize his book. They are color-coded by source: 
white for interviews, orange for periodicals, blue for books and so on. He does 
a quick estimate of their number and slips a note that says "1,824 cards" under 
a magnet on the bulletin board. 
</P>
<P>
 I look in the first box, and the first section of cards is labeled, "Writing 
Style." I pull one card out: "28 May, TN Valley. As abstract as the blds book 
wants to be, it must glory in details -- zennishly." 
</P>
<P>
 Brand's style is zennish. He writes with an informality that belies the 
seriousness of his ideas. I have come to see his style as a combination of 
influences: his father (who wrote ad copy), Samuel Johnson (whom he can still 
quote from his studies at Exeter), '60s buttons (you have to be pithy to fit a 
slogan on a button) and his years of practice writing all those brief catalogue 
reviews. "These are the poetical efforts of a prose writer trying to plant a 
burr in the mind as it goes by in great haste," he says. "The mind collects 
stories, collects experiences, and it's pretty good at managing aphorisms and 
slogans and little rhymes." 
</P>
<P>
 Moving down the container, we pass a pile of printouts of his e-mail 
conversations with his friend, musician Brian Eno, whom he calls one of his 
"muses." We get to the 500 books, and the hundreds of magazines he's used for 
the buildings research, all carefully organized and labeled. Brand may survive 
on improvisation, inventing and reinventing himself, but the evidence of his 
discipline and drive are all around him. He calls it a "necessary paradox." 
</P>
<P>
 I ask what he reads for work. Not the New York Times, he says. Everybody he 
knows reads it, so he feels he doesn't have to. Instead, he reads the weekly 
Science, since "science is the only news, really, in the world." He keeps up 
with Library Journal, which he finds "a very good source of pretty sensible 
book reviews," and also with the Atlantic Monthly and Foreign Affairs, to get a 
deeper view of current events. He was for many years a loyal Wall Street 
Journal reader, until he finally couldn't take the editorial page any longer. 
"It's so predictable and well-written and stupid, so f- - - 'em." 
</P>
<P>
 He learns the most, he says, from venturing out -- into the WELL, or into 
conversations of any sort. He "visits" the WELL for about an hour and a half to 
two hours, nearly every day, tuning in routinely to the news of the WELL 
itself, the Generation X conference, the books section and the GBN private 
section, where he's responsible for maintaining the quality of the discourse. 
</P>
<P>
 As we talk about the tools he uses to stay fresh, he keeps insisting that one 
of the most important is laziness. At first that seems crazy to me, because he 
says he works 10 hours a day, seven days a week -- with an occasional break for 
a hike on the weekends. Then he explains what he learned in the Army. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was taught that there are four kinds of officers -- stupid and industrious, 
stupid and lazy, smart and industrious and smart and lazy. And the worst of 
these is stupid and industrious and the best of these is smart and lazy. And 
I've always tried to live up to that," he says, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is that the best? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because an officer is the one who's trying to figure out what's missing here. 
The officer is the one who needs to see how maybe we're doing the wrong thing 
right and we'd be better off doing the right thing right. The lazy officer who 
is smart will figure out a way to do it quicker, cheaper, faster, easier, with 
less involvement of people, whatever it is, because he's so lazy. And that's 
what you want. An industrious person will revel in crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 The result of that strategy is that Brand is not -- as many people assume -- 
wealthy. The more than $1 million generated from the first catalogue was used 
to set up the nonprofit Point Foundation and found CoEvolution Quarterly. (He 
also threw a famous all-night party and gave away $20,000 of the profits in 
cash.) Recently, the foundation sold the WELL to finance "The Millennium Whole 
Earth Catalog." After taxes and his agent's fee, Brand says, he received an 
advance of $45,000 for "How Buildings Learn." His savings, he says, consist of 
$15,000. The only thing he and his wife own that's worth anything is their 
tugboat, the Mirene. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1912, the Mirene is tied up at the Sausalito docks, a five-minute 
walk from Brand's fishing-boat office and the containers. Its 450 square feet 
is their entire living space. They have spent more than $150,000 to renovate 
it, stripping and revarnishing the original Douglas fir paneling and installing 
French doors. The design feels like a piece of clothing tailored especially for 
the two of them. (Brand's only child, 17-year-old son Noah Johnson, "a 
wonderful leftover from a romance that was otherwise ending," lives with his 
mother in Berkeley.) 
</P>
<P>
 It's sunset, and we sit on the deck as the air grows chilly. Brand pulls out 
his monocular to look more closely at a bird and confirms that it's a 
kingfisher making a surprise appearance among the boats. We talk of the man who 
was murdered on these docks the night before. He isn't kidding when he says 
that this is his Cannery Row, a rough and rowdy waterfront scene. This is, 
after all, the man who attached this aphorism to his Who's Who profile: "Life 
rides. Death drives." 
</P>
<P>
 I sip wine with Phelan, 42, who's been married to Brand for 11 years. Like 
Brand, she's had several careers, the most recent a mail-order 
equestrian-supply business that she has sold. In 1978, she helped start 
Planetree, a nonprofit consumer health-care organization that pioneered 
patient-centered care. I ask how it is that her husband has taken his own best 
"Whole Earth Catalog" advice and managed a do-it-yourself life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone once said to Stewart -- this is many years ago -- they thought he 
might be nominated for a McArthur grant. Stewart thought that would be an 
incredible honor and really wonderful, since we don't have tons of money. It 
would be very liberating. And he was really disappointed when the McArthurs 
came out that he wasn't listed. And he said, you know, 'I've just got to live 
my life as though I always have a McArthur." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Stewart Brand is, as Mitch Kapor put it, "a great inventor in the realm of 
ideas," perhaps his greatest invention is his own life. Without intending to do 
so, says his close friend Kevin Kelly, he made up "the postmodern life, the 
non-career career." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971, as he was trying to decide what to do after editing that most famous 
"Whole Earth Catalog," he wrote: "The voices that you need to hear, whisper, 
slowly and infrequently. The only way to hear them is listen. . . . There's a 
difference between intention driving us on, and mystery pulling us on. Mystery 
will always educate and correct. Intention can go off the end of its own limb." 
</P>
<P>
 So what mystery will pull him next? Someone who knows him well had told me to 
ask him about the "clock project." 
</P>
<P>
 He stiffens. "Very tentative. Very fragile. Probably, possibly might not 
happen. Don't know who's involved, if anybody. So I just can't talk about it 
until it's real enough to talk about, and maybe not then. No offense intended." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when I get to the last page of "How Buildings Learn," I discover just 
what the clock project might be. Brand is hammering home his argument about the 
importance of slow, evolutionary design one last time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's an exercise. Computer scientist Danny Hillis has proposed the making 
of 'a large (think Stonehenge) mechanical clock, powered by seasonal 
temperature changes. It ticks once a year, bongs once a century, and the cuckoo 
comes out every millennium.' The point is to have a charismatic object that 
helps people think long-term." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not hard to imagine the appeal of such a project to the man who once sat 
on a San Francisco rooftop and dreamed up the question, "Why haven't we seen a 
photograph of the whole Earth yet?" It's also not hard to imagine that this 
same man may one day be remembered for something he hasn't yet done. Spreading 
the Words 
</P>
<P>
 One of Stewart Brand's jobs at the Global Business Network is to select books, 
CDs, journals, articles and software for its members. Here's what he chose for 
1992 and 1993: 
</P>

 When the first major "Whole Earth Catalog" received the National Book Award, 
one of the judges said: "In 100 years this will probably be the only book of 
the year 1971 to be remembered." Like MTV and the Internet, the mail-order 
catalogue was a media breakthrough. It's now such a historic artifact that the 
early editions are stored in a special collection in the UCLA library. A cross 
between an encyclopedia and L. L. Bean, the oversized catalogue provided 
non-experts with "access to tools" -- from wind generators to the visions of a 
Sioux wise man. In retrospect, Stewart Brand sees that he took do-it-yourself 
and "intellectualized it and upscaled it and legitimized it and made it a pop 
culture item." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Millennium Whole Earth Catalog," just arriving in bookstores, is the 
sixth major edition. Published by the Point Foundation and distributed by 
HarperSanFrancisco, the impressive 384-page, $30 paperback contains more than 
3,000 entries. Editor Howard Rheingold stresses how the new catalogue has 
evolved from Brand's original vision. The 1980 version, for instance, boasted 
37 pages on alternative energy. The new edition devotes only four, largely 
because the original catalogue so popularized the idea that numerous other 
books and resources are now available. Instead, "The Millenium Whole Earth 
Catalog" guides readers on setting up a computer bulletin board system, saving 
seeds or talking to teen-agers about drugs. "We're saying there's not a 
solution to be sold," says Rheingold. "There's only a solution to be found. 
You've got to find it yourself."

<TEXT>
<P>
 The man in front of me holds the knife a hand's width from my face. I don't 
move. For the next 60 seconds, I will use only my eyes and ears. My hands are 
at my sides. Eight-inch blade, I notice, brown-leather handle, dulled from use. 
I'm surprised by the thickness of the shank of steel. It must weigh half a 
pound, I think for no reason. Then I look away, half instinctively, half 
remembering a presentation at my daughter's high school where the kids were 
told that if accosted by someone with a weapon, don't focus on the weapon. I 
look at the man: About 45 years old; 5 feet, 8 inches; 170 pounds, dark 
coffee-color skin, triangular beard, smiling eyes. He's happy. "That's a 
knife," he says, satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 I note the mix of street twang and South America in his too-soft voice. Then 
another voice speaks. It belongs to the boy beside me. "It's not sharp," he 
says. I can hear his youth in his voice, curious, wanting to challenge, but for 
all of that, uncertain. The man's eyes open a little, and I notice a spark of 
light fly out of them. "You think it's not sharp?" he says. "Give me your 
hand." 
</P>
<P>
 "No way," says the boy. He puts a foot of distance between his shoulder and 
mine, but I can still feel the tension in his body. Then the man speaks again. 
His voice is even softer than before, his face relaxed, his eyes revealing even 
more light as he looks right at the boy. "I wouldn't cut you, brother," he 
tells the boy. "I wouldn't do anything to hurt you at all. Straight up?" No one 
speaks. Then, "Straight up," says the boy. "For real?" the man checks in. He 
needs to know the boy believes him. "For real." 
</P>
<P>
 The moment is over, but in the room where I volunteer with 12 teen-age 
gangbangers and kids at risk of becoming one, more than one boy is relieved. 
Sitting on the sagging couches and chairs of this community center in 
South-Central Los Angeles, the boys laugh and poke each other to let out the 
tension. But I can see in their eyes that the man's message has penetrated 
deeply. More deeply than an eight-inch blade. Someone in their lives has 
whispered in a voice that demanded to be heard, "I wouldn't do anything to hurt 
you at all."  
</P>
<P>
 And in this room of kids, here because they have been hurt and, in turn, have 
hurt others -- out of fear, anger, poverty, hopelessness and confusion -- these 
are words they haven't heard too often, if ever, before. These are words they 
can't afford to miss. So even though they may not yet completely trust the man 
with the knife (a former gangbanger like me who had help turning his life 
around and hopes to offer the same help for as many of these young ones as he 
can), and even though they lean back casually against the torn couches with the 
practiced indifference and nonchalance they feel they need just to get down the 
street, I can see that something inside of them leans forward, as if to catch a 
trace of something invisible and rare. Straight up. 
</P>
<P>
 I was a boy very much like them. Their faces, their voices, flash and echo a 
face and voice I recognize as my own. Of course, that was a long time ago in 
New York City, and my crew and I wouldn't have been caught wearing the 
saggy-baggy outfits these boys wear. Or the shaved heads! We were more the 
stiletto type. Tight. Cool. Dress like a blade, you are one -- all the danger 
held coiled inside, ready to spring without warning. But for all of that, as I 
look at their faces and hear what they are willing to say to the group and what 
they can't yet say, I see that their feelings are the same as mine were then: 
The fear behind the strut. The terror and pain of feeling so invisible. The 
bewildering self-hatred that rises up inside when they ask themselves why they 
did what they did, and so often come up empty for an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Their words move through me like ghosts of my own young blood as I listen to 
them and read what young people locked down in Juvenile Hall have written about 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Life, life, you can't be like this. -- Jeremy 
</P>
<P>
 there's no one that could help you / help you understand what to do / with 
those starving bones of you -- Evan 
</P>
<P>
 Once upon a time I had a dream that someday I would be / locked up and they 
would charge me with murder and it came / true. -- Arthur 
</P>
<P>
 DESIRE I want / sunlight in / my hands. / I want water / like my mothers / 
smiles / to cover / me / I want / my arms / from behind / my back -- Jesse 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I look around the room as each of the boys responds to the question posed by 
the man with the knife and tells the group what offense he committed to prompt 
the court to put him in this program. Oddly enough, there is no boasting. Some 
of the boys even stare at the carpeted floor as they tell the group what they 
have done. For, as one boy wrote, "If you win you lose/on project street." The 
list holds no surprises: sale or possession of illegal substances, grand theft 
auto, possession or use of gun/knife/ice pick or other weapon, destruction of 
property, theft, robbery, brawling. These children (as young as 8) have had a 
hard bite taken out of them in their immediate circumstances, and in the 
culture at large, by unremitting abuse or neglect from their parents and 
society. And since no one in their lives has made any other options 
meaningfully accessible and clear, they have been biting back in confusion and 
rage to provide for their needs. To paraphrase James Baldwin: While children 
don't always listen to their parents, they rarely fail to imitate them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason I started gang-bangin'," wrote one young man now living in 
Juvenile Hall, "is because as I grew up people were telling me how crazy and 
down my father and uncles were. That influenced me to start bangin' and wanting 
to get a name for myself. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 But a child's need to feel protected, wanted -- to feel heard -- does not go 
away. And if families and society do not meet these needs, life as a member of 
a gang can begin to look attractive. When racial, social and economic 
circumstances have torn families apart, children lack supportive and protective 
homes, and they will try to create a substitute that satisfies their needs. 
Unless they're offered constructive solutions to their problems, and directly 
experience the effects, such children will most often create "solutions" that 
cause them to continue to hurt others and themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeys. Homeboys. Homegirls. The words in this context are relatively new to 
our national vocabulary, but the situation they reflect is not. Listen to the 
language of it. Homey, the safe sense of "there's no place like home." But 
these homeys are different, and the feeling of safety they offer each other is 
often found in the steel grip of a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Many young people have shocked us by revealing that they are willing to kill 
or die for their "homeys." "I love my homeboys. I will kill and die for them," 
one wrote while incarcerated. "I will take care of them. I'll be there in bad 
times and good times and show them that I care. . . . I will give them what I 
have. . . . They're my only family I got and the only people I care for." 
</P>
<P>
 Listen to the statements of tenderness banging right up there against the 
statements of violence. Are they really so far from what most people feel is 
instinctively and morally justified in their own lives? Wouldn't most people 
you know say that though they would never consider it possible in other 
circumstances, they can imagine doing these very same things for their 
"family"? And isn't there a kind of fierce, if sad, pride in their tone when 
they say it? 
</P>
<P>
 This feeling of belonging and having people depend on you is one of the 
primary reasons children join gangs and move into criminal activity. And the 
combination of personal and historical conditions in their lives makes such a 
"decision," half-conscious at best, a subtle one: A child can shift 
incrementally from innocent to social misfit or criminal. I know the painful 
truth of this only too well because of the life I lived on the streets of my 
working-class neighborhood in New York City, where eventually I walked the 
frightening path from being a sensitive, intuitive, thoughtful child to 
becoming a "youthful offender" and gang member. Except for the recent 
prominence of drugs and the money to be made dealing them, much of what I lived 
through is still ground sadly covered by too many young people today.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I carry with me a very clear sense of my own young foot covering the ground of 
my New York neighborhood, trying to avoid being knocked over by the dangerous 
forces I encountered every day as a pre-adolescent, adolescent and teen-ager. 
I'm talking about being able to just get down the street without having to face 
any number of bullies (often the kids beaten by alcoholic fathers) who would 
not miss an opportunity to take me out on the spot because I was a sickly 
child, weaker than they were; without running into the gang of 8- to 
10-year-olds known as the Shamrocks, boys my age who chased me down and, 
inevitably catching up with me, held me, spit into my face, punched me in the 
head or stomach and kicked me while they threatened to cut me with beer-can 
openers or knives. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm talking about trying to get out of my parents' apartment and down the 
street without running into my own father, a hard-working man, a loving man 
even, whose sudden and arbitrarily angry physical violence had taught me that, 
without warning, I might be stabbed in the hand, time and again, at dinner with 
a fork -- drawing blood -- for displeasing him. Or I might have my head slammed 
into a door or wall of our apartment, or be hit with the back of a 
two-foot-long wooden clothes brush for some infraction, or have my face slapped 
in the house or on the street or in a restaurant before he pulled me out of my 
seat by my hair and dragged me out onto the sidewalk, where he would issue a 
stern and terrifying warning of the possibility of harm if I didn't "straighten 
up" (since apparently my nervous energy at the table, the accumulation of all 
the fear I constantly felt, was too much for him). And then, after a slap in 
the face, I'd have to stifle all the fear and humiliation and walk calmly back 
in as if we had simply gone out together to what? Have a little private joke? 
Man to man? 
</P>
<P>
 In large part, this was my physical and emotional reality until my teen years. 
Neither in my home, nor on the street, did I feel I was safe from sudden 
violence. It might come from those who said they loved me or those who clearly 
hated me, but the violence would come -- if not one day, then the next. 
</P>
<P>
 I was unsafe at home, unsafe in the street, a sensitive child who had spent a 
great deal of time in a sickbed (no wonder) tended by an equally sensitive, 
frightened, depressed mother who became glued to me through the vehicle of my 
constant childhood illnesses. She trapped me there with her need, creating even 
greater resentment and tension for me with my father, since the female 
attention of the household was reserved for the son. Where was I to go? The 
closer I moved to my mother's realm or "hid in my mother's skirts," as my 
brother used to taunt, the further I moved from any chance to be a man as it 
seemed to be defined in the violent atmosphere of my youth. And yet this "male 
world" of the streets and my father held only terror.  
</P>
<P>
 Years later, my mother told me that when I was 5, my kindergarten teacher said 
to her, when they met in the street, "We've got to do something to save your 
little boy with the golden eyes." No one ever followed up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I am 10 years old and playing in the local schoolyard with a friend who feels 
safe to me. He is one year older than I am, but because we are so much alike 
physically and emotionally, I feel I can trust him. Suddenly, without warning 
or provocation, this boy punches me as hard as he can in the solar plexus, 
knocking the wind out of me, and then stands over me looking down to where I 
have collapsed onto my knees. He does not offer a hand to help or an 
explanation, but watches with great curiosity as I heave and gasp for air. When 
I can get up from the pavement, I do and, feeling hurt by the betrayal, walk 
away without a word. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years later, this same person calls from another city and asks if he 
can stay at my house, since he will be in town on business. I say yes. The 
first night he is there, I ask him if he recalls the incident and he replies, 
"Vividly." I ask, "Why did you do that?" and he says, "You know, I was so 
scared in those days and so tired of being beaten up, I just needed to know 
that I could connect -- and I knew because you were weaker you couldn't 
retaliate." (Listen to the delicious unconscious use of the word connect. 
Violence as connection, as the vehicle of connection with someone else very 
much like oneself, perhaps in ways one can't bear or has come to despise; and, 
importantly, violence as a connection with aspects of the self and the 
collective experience. A way to belong.) 
</P>
<P>
 Two years after that scene in the schoolyard, I have not yet learned the 
lesson in evidence everywhere around me -- to betray myself and my needs by 
hiding behind the collective mask of brutal indifference. I read, play and 
listen to classical music, love friends and family easily, feel and dream 
deeply, am vulnerable to subtle senses of people and things and my intuition, 
pray nightly for my teams to win -- and still pay for all of it in the 
neighborhood and at home. 
</P>
<P>
 One day I am in the seventh-grade schoolyard and, during a game of stickball, 
get into a fistfight with a boy I know and like, not one of the "bad boys." I 
feel oddly confident of myself, and I actually swing my fist toward a boy's 
face for the first time in my life. But just before making contact, my hand 
automatically opens, and I end up slapping him. Over and over again I try to 
punch him in the face, but I just cannot. My fist just will not stay a fist. In 
the crowd of boys that gathers to enjoy the fight, someone shouts, "He hits 
like a girl!" When my opponent realizes this, he rushes me and throws me to the 
ground and pounds my head into the pavement until there is blood all over and 
the others pull him off me. I end up with a mild concussion. My father picks me 
up from the nurse's office at school and mentions, in passing, "I guess you're 
not much of a fighter." 
</P>
<P>
 On two occasions I am targeted for sexual assault by two different men in 
their 20s. Once by a Korean War veteran who is known in the neighborhood to be 
a little crazy since the war and who reputedly had a metal plate in his head to 
cover a skull wound. Another time by the local parks and recreation teacher, 
who enlists four teen-age boys to hold me down during the assault. I am 
terrified. During both attacks I manage to stop the assault by grabbing, in the 
first instance, a hammer, and in the second, a baseball bat that happened to be 
within reach. I swing at the heads of these men with all the fear I have inside 
me. The boy who couldn't close his fist now has learned to grip a weapon for 
dear life. Not long after , I abandon my "nice" friends, half aware that I am 
doing this because I cannot suffer any more fear and shame, and start hanging 
out with tougher boys. I mask who I am and change my manner of dress, speech, 
walk and general physical appearance. I am becoming known in the neighborhood 
and at school as a "hood." Conscious that I no longer want to be a target, I 
lift weights three times a week with a new friend who is three years older, the 
son of a cop who moved into the neighborhood from East Harlem. He is confident 
and tough. I put on some weight and develop muscles. Some of the guys I now 
hang around with on the corner don't really accept me, and even attack me, but 
the gang leader who has taken a liking to me provides some protection. I have 
yet to prove myself. 
</P>
<P>
 Then one night, my friend Rico and I are jumped by eight or nine punks in a 
different neighborhood. The next morning, I ask the gang leader if he and some 
of the guys will come with me to find them, and he says yes. I ask to borrow 
his ring, which has some solid metal cutting edges on it, and put it on. About 
10 of us go up to the other neighborhood. I spot the ringleader of the boys who 
jumped me -- oddly enough, he is a wimpy guy like I had been -- and I go up to 
him as my friends surround us. Within 10 seconds I hit him squarely in the nose 
with a closed fist, breaking his nose, and I don't stop hitting him until he 
can no longer move as I kick him in the head with my boots. 
</P>
<P>
 I am wailing on him and want to keep going, but my friends stop me because a 
woman starts to scream for the police. We run through the streets, all of us, 
elated, happy, powerful. I fight back a moment of regret, look down at myself 
and see that I am covered in blood. But it is the other boy's blood this time 
and, feeling an odd combination of shame and pride, I wear it like a 
conqueror's flag. Ironically, it is Mother's Day. I am asked officially into 
the gang. By eighth grade I have been kicked out of the special classes for 
bright and talented music students and put in the room set aside for troubled 
kids and kids already in trouble with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, I am accosted outside my junior high school by a Puerto Rican gang 
because I have insulted one of their own. There are about 30 of them, and I am 
there with just two friends from my gang. I have a knife open in my hand, which 
is hidden in the pocket of my trench coat. I hope no one can see my hand 
shaking. 
</P>

 After I am twice told by their leader, a guy named Cisco, to apologize, and 
twice I refuse, I feel something on my chest. I look down and see that he is 
holding a gun right at my heart. I feel my moment. I know I will not apologize, 
though no one could blame me if I did. I say something to him that, in his poor 
English, I feel he will misunderstand as an apology but which is really an 
insult. If it works I am cool beyond belief. If it doesn't work maybe I am 
dead. I am so out of touch with who I am, I don't know why I am doing this. I 
just do it. It works. He puts the gun down, warns me and the gang leaves. My 
friends tell me I am crazy, and we all laugh together and go for a smoke. As we 
walk away I hear the story already being told by the kids in the crowd that 
gathered to see the fight.  
</P>
<P>
 All during this time, and in the years that follow, I continue to enjoy 
listening to classical music, reading and keeping other aspects of a private 
life alive. One friend I felt I could trust, a girl, reminded me years later 
that I once broke away from a very pleasant and somewhat complicated 
philosophical conversation we were having as we walked down the hall in high 
school, threw a boy against the wall, threatened him, hit him so hard he 
collapsed to the floor, and then continued our conversation as if nothing had 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the palpable resource of love and tenderness my mother provided in my 
life, I grew determinedly tougher. Before I was out of ninth grade, I had hit 
one teacher with a chair (the guidance counselor who began a discussion of what 
was bothering me by calling me a Nazi), tried to stab another teacher in the 
back with a sharp instrument, took part in gang fights, used force and weapons 
to mug and rob people and rolled neighborhood drunks on Saturday nights to get 
some money. Distorted as it may seem, I "connected," and though it meant I got 
shot at by rival gang members, battled with police and lived a life that didn't 
fit my deepest nature, at the time it did fit something. It was the best 
solution I was able to come up with to answer the years of shame, abuse and 
fear. But this solution did not succeed in making me immune from all emotion or 
moral concern. It only created more shame, abuse and fear within me. This time, 
however, there was no way to escape the perpetrator. It was me. 
</P>

 The autumn I entered 11th grade, I went to pick up my schedule. I was dressed 
particularly sharp to let everyone know not to mess with me, teachers included. 
Time and again, you had to get your message out right from the start to command 
the respect you needed to keep you safe. I walked into the room for my math 
class, and before I knew it I was taking a test the teacher had handed out to 
see what we knew. Indifferent to the result, I finished up quickly and sat 
there staring out the window. The teacher called me up to the front of the room 
and asked to see my paper. Then, while I stood there, she looked it over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come with me," she said. We went into the hall and she said, "You're in the 
wrong class." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because you got everything right in 10 minutes," she smiled. "You should be 
in the advanced class." She looked as if she expected me to be pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I shouldn't," I told her. She looked at my paper again. "I really think 
you should. You're going to be way ahead of the rest of this class, and you're 
going to be bored." 
</P>
<P>
 "Look," I said, "I got out of all those classes, and I'm not going back. 
Besides, I'll be quitting school this year anyway. I'm 16. So leave me alone." 
</P>
<P>
 She looked at me, right at me, and then said, "OK. I don't mind having someone 
smart in my room. Go back inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Brief and insignificant as it may seem, that was the beginning of the change 
that has led me to live a life beyond anything I might have imagined. I have 
thought about that quick exchange many times over the years and asked myself, 
"Why that one? Why that time?" Certainly other teachers had said encouraging 
things. I can only say that I believe I was caught by the almost conspiratorial 
way this teacher implied, "I know you. You're all right with me. I'm on your 
side." And then didn't demand anything I couldn't bring myself to give. In the 
weeks, months and years that followed, during which this teacher slowly reeled 
me in, she never once wavered in her commitment to me, or in her willingness to 
help me discover those things that I could use to nurture my own soul. 
</P>
<P>
 Some remarkable thought and writing has gone into the subject of childhood and 
the roots of violence. To my mind, none is more striking than the work of 
psychoanalyst Alice Miller. In "For Your Own Good: Hidden Cruelty in 
Child-Rearing &the Roots of Violence," Miller writes: "In order to be able to 
develop, children need the help of adults who are aware of their needs, who 
protect them, respect them, take them seriously, love them, and honestly help 
them to orientate themselves. When these vital needs of the child are 
frustrated and the child, instead, is abused for the needs of the adult -- 
beaten, punished, maltreated, manipulated, neglected, or betrayed, without the 
interference of a witness -- then the integrity of the child will suffer a 
lifelong hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 She goes on to say that when the anger a child feels (which is a healthy 
response to the circumstances causing harm) is forbidden and the child can find 
no sanctioned means to release it, this stored-up anger will be forcefully and 
destructively vented against others or against himself. Add to the anger a 
child's experience of helplessness, fear and lack of hope, and it is not too 
difficult to understand why he might retaliate with destructive acts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Miller offers some hope. "An abused child," she tells us, "will not become 
either a criminal or mentally ill if . . . he meets a person who clearly 
realizes that it is not the beaten, helpless child, but his environment, which 
is crazy." These people must declare themselves, by their actions, to be allies 
and trustworthy friends of the child. This is what my teacher did and why I 
allowed her to help me help myself. It is what the man with the knife and I and 
others hope to accomplish in our weekly meetings with the kids. This ends the 
child's isolation and loneliness as that child faces the frustration and 
helplessness that distresses him at every turn. This provides a witness to the 
child's pain and potential, and the guidance, encouragement and support a child 
needs. It holds up a new mirror in which a new face may gradually come to be 
seen. One the child recognizes, truly, as his own. 
</P>
<P>
 To the extent that we provide this, both as a society and as individuals, we 
can save or destroy a life. Children are the mirrors of our own feelings about 
life itself, about possibility, joy, a future. Starting at the very beginning 
of their lives, children learn kindness when kindness is the order of the day, 
and they learn insensitivity, cruelty and viciousness by the same means. And 
so, as mirrors, they cast back the face of the world as it has been given to 
them. If we hate the image in the mirror, can we really justify blaming the 
mirror for what we have placed within its borders? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In our weekly meetings we mirror as much as we can. The work is difficult 
because lives are on the line. One day you think you're getting through to one 
of the kids and the next week you discover the powerful demands of his 
environment have pulled him out of your grasp again. But success is not a 
stranger to our group. One day, just before the start of the weekly meeting at 
the community center, a young man who had attended for two years pulled me over 
to the side.  
</P>
<P>
 "Jose, how you doing?" I said to him. "You're looking good." Jose had 
originally been busted for 'jacking people with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided to get out," he said. I could hardly believe what he was saying and 
he could see it. "I'm done banging," he told me. 
</P>
<P>
 "All right!" I said. I gave him my hand. "I'm proud of you, man. How did it go 
down with your guys?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It was OK," he said. "I've been banging since I was 9 and they all know I 
been down with them every time. I just told them last night I'm cutting my 
pants."  
</P>
<P>
 "That's good, Jose. I can't stand those baggy pants you guys are wearing." We 
both laughed. Then I asked him, "What are you going to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," he said, "I been thinking about it. You know, I've been coming here 
and listening all this time, and my mom's getting at me about why you doing 
this and why you doing that and also I got three brothers and I been watching 
them, too. How they live. One of them's going back to jail this week for drugs, 
but the other two have families and houses near Sacramento. One's got his own 
truck and the other works for a bus company." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's good, Jose," I said. "They're making good lives." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So what about you? You can make a life, too, you know. I'm sorry about your 
brother this week but you don't have to go down like he is." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know. I been thinking maybe I'd like to be a probation officer. Do you 
think I could do it?" 
</P>
<P>
 In that moment, this 19-year-old sounded like a very small child. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know you can, Jose. You know why?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Why?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Because you're a bad-ass and you could relate to those guys." 
</P>
<P>
 He laughed. "That's true. But I'm not as much of a bad-ass as you are." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, you're not," I told him. "Maybe one day you'll be hanging out here 
helping these guys make the step you just made." 
</P>
<P>
 He laughed again. "Maybe," he said. Then a serious look came into his face. 
"How do you get to be a probation officer? You got to go to school, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Right. But you can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 "You think I can?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I know you can, Jose. If you can make the step out, you can do anything you 
want to do. You're a good man. I'm proud of you today. Let's go inside and tell 
the other guys." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no, no. I don't want to make a big deal of myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But we did.

WHINING AND DINING; ITS NO LONGER ENOUGH TO KNOW THE HOTTEST CHEFS AND THE

 Pasquale and Anna Morra consider themselves accommodating people, but this was 
too much to ask. The man at the corner table wanted penne arrabiata with a 
twist: He wanted smoked mozzarella added to the spicy tomato sauce. And some 
clams. And some sun-dried tomatoes. All mixed together. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasquale listened glumly to the order. He tried to convince the customer that 
it was a mistake on several levels. The sauce didn't need smoked cheese. Even 
if it did, he would never combine cheese and shellfish. And the sun-dried 
tomatoes were too strong. Wouldn't the man reconsider? 
</P>
<P>
 The diner held his ground. He knew what he wanted, and what he emphatically 
didn't want was a lecture about regional authenticity or appropriate flavor 
combinations. The customer, after all, is always right. 
</P>
<P>
 Morra retreated to the kitchen at Da Pasquale, the Beverly Hills trattoria he 
and his chef wife, Anna, opened in 1989, and confessed his anguish to her. He 
knew it was wrong to serve such a dish, but the man wanted it and nothing else. 
If he fed the guy, he would hate himself. If he didn't feed the guy, he was 
going to send an angry man out into the world to bad-mouth his restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 He considered his wife an artist in the kitchen, but he had a business to run. 
Morra had to compromise. Ten minutes later he appeared at the man's table with 
two plates -- one bowl of penne arrabiata with a reasonable amount of smoked 
cheese mixed in, and a separate side order of clams and sun-dried tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here," he said. "Now I'm going to turn my back and go into the kitchen. You 
can do whatever you want." At which point the man mixed his customized dish and 
devoured it. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the world of menu manipulation, a far cry from the half-caff two-step 
immortalized in Steve Martin's comedy "L.A. Story." In the movies, food 
tweakers are a joke, whether it's Meg Ryan being prissy in "When Harry Met 
Sally. . . ." or Jack Nicholson demanding a chicken salad sandwich on toast, 
hold the chicken salad, in "Five Easy Pieces."  
</P>
<P>
 The real world is not quite so adorable. Demanding diners have descended on 
what remains of Los Angeles' recession-ravaged eating scene. They're no longer 
looking for the hot chef or the snooty menu. They don't need to have an 
intimate relationship with either the cook or his dishes. Status, now, comes 
from knowing what you want and getting it. Today's diner is after personal 
satisfaction, however idiosyncratic, however weird. That's the point. He wants 
what he wants, centuries of culinary wisdom notwithstanding. He wants to be 
acknowledged; he wants to be unique. 
</P>
<P>
 It is decidedly a buyers' market. It is the era of what Piero Selvaggio, owner 
of Valentino, Primi and Posto, calls " Chicca -- the little things people want 
to do." Let the restaurateur beware. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The sauce-on-the-side movement began innocently enough with people like my 
mother, who started families in the antiseptic 1950s and came to value clean 
consistency above all else. Machine-cut frozen green beans were a dependable 
status symbol, proof that moms had more important things to do with their time 
than wash, top and tail the real thing. We had conquered nature -- cleaned it, 
sliced it on the diagonal in absolutely uniform little chunks, and wedged it 
into a nice little white box that fit quite snugly in a stack of other nice 
little white boxes. Forget language. What set us apart from the apes was frozen 
produce. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictability was patriotic, too. Plain meat and potatoes were aggressively 
American, a hefty emblem of the middle class, proof that life was better here. 
Maybe our immigrant ancestors had to smother a tough cut of meat in an ethnic 
sauce, but not us. It was slab cuisine: Heat the meat, thaw the sides, and eat. 
We distrusted any chef who tried to mask the entree with a sauce -- did he 
think we couldn't afford the very best?  
</P>
<P>
 And when the offspring of the convenience generation went off to college, what 
did the '60s generation get? Groovy vegetarian grub, mile-high sandwiches that 
were three-quarters alfalfa sprouts and nothing that required the execution of 
a fellow mammal. They rebelled against soulless technology and made pals with 
the planet again. It was the era of conscience cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the '70s were over, we were crazy for a good meal.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it was all that extremism that led to the binge mentality of the 
1980s. Everyone who was anyone had to have a favorite high-end restaurant, 
where they dined so often that they didn't even need to open the menu. They 
knew all the dishes by heart and made a point of being blase about things like 
skate wing and sweetbreads. 
</P>
<P>
 Such behavior is now considered politically incorrect; these are the lean 
1990s, a decade of restraint and responsibility, of quality time and downsized 
expectations. So all those food-circuit big shots are forced to find a new way 
to channel their power urges. And the casualties, the ones whose arteries were 
lined by a blanket of Brie, have become convinced that the city's cooks are out 
to murder them by degree. The only safe haven is an off-the-menu meal.  
</P>
<P>
 There are two kinds of troublemakers these days. The players of the last 
decade need to feel spoiled without seeming pretentious. A favorite story on 
the restaurant circuit concerns a particular character actor who likes to go to 
Italian restaurants, glance at the menu and then ask if the chef couldn't 
possibly make up something special for him -- say, some pasta with tomatoes, 
garlic and basil, as though such a dish weren't part of the fundamental 
alphabet of every Italian restaurant. It's probably on half the menus the actor 
pretends to read, but asking for it as a special dish, and getting it, provides 
the illusion that he is a singularly important fellow. 
</P>
<P>
 And the health fascists, who could do everyone a favor and either stay home or 
bring their own food with them to restaurants, seem determined to make everyone 
bend to their will. It would be easy enough to locate the lower-fat items on a 
menu and stick with those, but a considerable number of these folks want to 
have their cake, eat it too -- and not have it show up on their cholesterol 
test. More than one chef has had requests for risotto with no butter or oil, 
which is something like asking for a brick wall, hold the mortar.  
</P>
<P>
 The most frustrating diner is the classic Los Angeles hybrid, the one who acts 
like a Pritikin devotee for the first two courses and then undoes all his good 
deeds come dessert. One Drago customer, who took the long view, ordered a salad 
with dressing on the side and pasta with smoked salmon, vodka and cream, but 
without the cream, just so he could dive into the tiramisu with abandon. 
Another asked if she could have a decaf tiramisu ; she didn't want the 
espresso-soaked dessert to keep her awake at night.  
</P>
<P>
 (Italian restaurants are particularly vulnerable to the revisionist eater. 
They're victims of their own image: Italian cuisine is accessible, informal, 
healthy; it's far less intimidating than the last decade's darling, classic 
French cuisine. And Los Angeles diners are particularly enthusiastic about 
altering menu reality; maybe it's that pioneer spirit. "They're spoiled," says 
Celestino Drago, owner of Drago in Santa Monica. "In New York, it is what it is 
-- take it or leave it. This is Hollywood -- everybody's used to getting what 
they want.") 
</P>
<P>
 Food has become the image toy of the 1990s; people fool around with it just to 
prove that they can. Whenever I hear someone loudly instructing the waiter -- 
or, more aggressively, the chef, who's been summoned tableside for a public 
humiliation -- about what he wants to eat, I wonder. Does he really like a 
combination of smoked clams and shellfish because it tastes good? Or does he 
like it because it's not on the menu? I mean, think about what he's saying. 
He's telling the chef that nothing he's serving is good enough, that his years 
of experience and study pale next to a customer's imagination. And the 
dressing-down is public; everyone within hearing distance knows that this diner 
is important enough to demand attention. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose there's a nice democratic edge to all of this. Unlike more 
ostentatious trinkets, like a big BMW or an outsize house, a custom-built meal 
is something almost anyone can afford -- you can assert yourself at the local 
trattoria as easily as at a more chic eatery. Maybe that's what the low-rent 
'90s are all about. It's the people's decade. Anyone can have an attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't always this way, of course. In the halcyon days of the restaurant 
boom, back in the early 1980s, diners worshiped at the whisk of a favored chef. 
Cooks could be bullies, then. And to be fair, some of them were. Waiters took 
orders as though they were listening for secret passwords. If you ordered 
smart, you were treated well; if you ordered what they thought was a wrong 
combination, you were barely tolerated. Diners gratefully ate what was offered 
and impressed their friends with their ability to pronounce the names of the 
dishes.  
</P>
<P>
 Chefs were celebrities; they knew best. Mark Peel is now the chef and co-owner 
of Campanile with his wife, pastry chef and baker Nancy Silverton, but he 
recalls with relish his days as an angry young man, working at Ma Maison when 
Wolfgang Puck was the chef.  
</P>
<P>
 Puck often served lamb, and every now and then a hapless diner would incur the 
staff's disdain by requesting mint jelly, a clear sign of an unenlightened 
palate. One employee brought in a little bottle of the stuff as a joke, and 
soon after, a waiter noticed it and asked if he could serve it.  
</P>
<P>
 With the jar in plain sight, Puck politely explained that the restaurant did 
not have any mint jelly. The waiter persisted. Again, Puck apologized. Just to 
make trouble, Peel said, "But Wolf, it's right here." Puck picked up the mint 
jelly and threw it against a tile wall, where it shattered.  
</P>
<P>
 Mint jelly dripped down to the floor. Puck smiled at the waiter and said he 
was sorry. There was no mint jelly at Ma Maison. 
</P>
<P>
 But those days are gone forever. The balance of power has shifted. If diners 
sometimes used to pay for the privilege of feeling like a fool, now they can 
pay for the chance to act like one. People go out to eat less often than they 
used to, so when they do decide to splurge, the chef had better be ready to 
accommodate their wishes. Peel, now older and more diplomatic, offers a 
butterflied, grilled chicken seasoned with cracked pepper, fennel seed, cumin 
and spicy chile on his menu. He gets orders for it steamed, no skin, no salt, 
no fat, which he grudgingly fills. 
</P>
<P>
 But surrender can backfire. "You hear them when they're leaving, complaining 
that they don't know what the fuss was all about; the food was so bland," he 
says, with a rueful laugh. "Of course it's bland. They took away all the things 
that make it taste good. They could have ordered it the way we cook it and then 
just take the skin off themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 His wife has a shorter fuse. When a customer requested a scoop of chocolate 
ice cream on top of her lemon tart, Silverton sent the waiter back, twice, to 
gently suggest that while these were the woman's two favorite flavors, they 
would not be a happy mix. The woman refused to back down, so Silverton did. The 
very memory makes her wince.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are times," she sighs, "when I've been tempted to say, 'Forget it.' But 
then I think, 'Just turn your back and give them what they want.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Piero Selvaggio, who opened Valentino, his first restaurant, in 1972, has 
become a specialist in the culinary non sequitur: He's taken orders for risotto 
porcini with the mushrooms on the side, gnocchi with Gorgonzola cheese with the 
cheese on the side ("I just like to mix in the cheese myself," customers say) 
and a veal chop in orange juice and Grand Marnier. His chef made a pasta sauce 
of orange juice and tomato sauce for one man who loved the results so much that 
he wondered why Selvaggio didn't immediately add the dish to the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Selvaggio has been at it long enough to develop a sense of humor about such 
requests, but mostly he feels sorry for people who miss tasting a dish the way 
it was meant to be made. "Risotto with no butter?" he asks. "How can you swim 
and not be in the water? Someone thinks you can do the whole thing with olive 
oil, but he misses the thick moistness that butter brings."  
</P>
<P>
 The one-shot diner can be frustrating, but it's the repeat offenders who make 
life truly difficult for the restaurateur. How do you tell your regular 
customers that they don't know what's good for them?  
</P>
<P>
 Selvaggio dubbed one twice-weekly diner "Our Lady of the Overcooked 
Vermicelli," because no matter how long the chef boiled the angel hair pasta 
before he mixed in the pesto, it wasn't long enough. He indulged her for years, 
but on what turned out to be her last visit she was particularly demanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ran it under the hot water a few times and took it back and she still said 
it wasn't right," recalls Selvaggio. "I can't go back to a professional chef 
and say, 'Cook this more.' He'll say, 'Cook what?' " 
</P>
<P>
 He decided to sacrifice a customer: "For the first time in 20 years, I said, 
'Look, we just can't please you.' " Selvaggio never saw her again, except for 
one visit, when she was a guest at a large dinner hosted by someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes," he sighs, "you have to ask, 'Are we Valentino or a house of 
prostitution?' " 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Now that I've insulted every finicky diner in the greater Los Angeles area, 
let me defend your rights -- within reason. Not the power rangers; they get 
high on pushing people around, and the only consolation chefs have is the 
knowledge that they aren't the only ones being hassled. The same person who 
snubs a chef undoubtedly exhibits disdain for his mechanic, his doctor, his 
agent and anybody else who's technically in a service industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But people with health problems have a real issue to face. No one is 
suggesting that you have to order the pasta in vodka and cream if you're are a 
teetotaler with a family history of heart disease. I understand limitations. My 
husband is allergic to onions unless they've been cooked forever. My dad, who 
was diabetic, had to plot his day's diet in advance just to be able to eat a 
scoop of ice cream at dinner.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, people just have to make small adjustments. But with luck, we can 
inspire a chef to come up with a dish he wants to make again. Tonino Morra, 
Pasquale's older brother and the owner of Caffe Toto in West Los Angeles, was 
the pizza chef at Il Forno when a regular customer came in, devastated by a 
doctor's recommendation that he forgo pizza in deference to his cholesterol 
count. The man had a pizza jones. He implored Tonino to make a pie that 
wouldn't kill him. 
</P>
<P>
 So Tonino invented a pizza with tomato sauce, no cheese, lots of basil, garlic 
and shiitake mushrooms -- and named it Pizza Ken after the customer (who, ever 
grateful, has followed him to his new digs). Other customers saw it, tried it, 
liked it and order it whether they need to or not. 
</P>
<P>
 If you believe that fat is the devil in oleaginous form, by all means pick a 
dish that seems light on the oil and butter -- or buy a copy of "Healthy Dining 
in Los Angeles," which analyzes dishes at 85 area restaurants -- and order 
strictly by the numbers.  
</P>
<P>
 But there's a difference between reasonable caution and fundamental 
conservatism. Fear of the unknown: It's the one thing that big shots and health 
hard-liners have in common. They just don't want to take a chance. I always 
knew I disliked Roy Cohn, the House Unamerican Activities Committee lawyer, but 
what clinched it for me was the revelation that he brought his own can of tuna 
when he lunched at New York's Le Cirque -- and the chef accommodated him by 
opening the can and plopping the tuna on a plate. This is not about lunch or 
taste buds or health. This is about control and the false safety of habit.  
</P>
<P>
 It is not dining out. 
</P>
<P>
 A restaurant is supposed to be an adventure. If I have one dining tenet, it's 
always to order something I wouldn't, or couldn't, make myself. In the days 
before pre-washed spinach, I ordered a lot of spinach; let somebody else stand 
up to his wet elbows in silt. I like to order duck, since my single attempt to 
cook that deceptively difficult bird almost lost me four good friends. 
</P>
<P>
 And when I'm feeling up to the occasion, in a particularly celebratory mood, I 
make the one special request that chefs are happy to honor. I ask them to feed 
me, no strings attached, to see what they like to cook when the constraints of 
pleasing the crowd are removed. If something looks suspicious, I follow the 
rule of my childhood: Try one bite, and if you don't like it, you don't have to 
finish it. I would have missed a lot of great food if I'd chickened out and 
ordered only the dishes that were already in my data bank.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, I wouldn't ask any of my favorite chefs to write this piece for me. You 
surely wouldn't let them compose your legal brief, negotiate your three-picture 
deal or fit the porcelain veneers on your most demanding celebrity patient. But 
that's my point: You have your profession. So does the cook. Trust him to make 
your taste buds happy.

MANDELA AND AIDES TO TAKE 20% PAY CUT

<P>
 Warding off criticism that it has raided public coffers, President Nelson 
Mandela's government on Saturday announced cuts of up to 20% in the salaries of 
Mandela and other top officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said the cuts will take effect immediately. He 
said Mandela's salary would fall to $130,000 from $163,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics, including Anglican Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, had accused the 
African National Congress-led government of voting itself excessive salaries 
after taking office following the nation's first all-race election in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela at first rejected the criticism but later said cutting salaries would 
set a good example of the fiscal discipline needed as South Africa addresses 
social ills left from the apartheid era.

SOCIAL WORKER FACES CHARGES AS WOMAN, 90, IS FOUND DEAD

<P>
 A social worker has been charged with stealing thousands of dollars from a 
90-year-old woman whose badly decomposed body was found in her bedroom closet 
under a pile of clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Renita Phifer, 35, was charged Friday with grand larceny and criminal 
possession of stolen property, police said.She is also being questioned in the 
death of Anne Wolowitz, whose body was discovered Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Phifer accompanied Wolowitz to a bank on June 13 to make a 
transaction on her account. When Wolowitz later noticed that $2,600 was missing 
from the account, she filed a grand-larceny complaint. Authorities tried to 
reach her regarding the complaint, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other transactions were made on Wolowitz's account in September and October. 
Police believe Phifer stole some of the money by writing herself checks.

CONSERVATIVES TAKE BEST SHOT AT SCHOOL BOARDS; POLITICS: EDUCATION ALLIANCE 
ACTIVISTS WHO SAY THEIR VIEWS ARE IGNORED FUND A COUNTYWIDE NETWORK OF 
CANDIDATES. MODERATES AND LIBERALS FEAR A TAKEOVER BY THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT. 
</P>

<P>
 A new political group that grew out of last year's bid to pass a school 
voucher initiative is helping to finance 30 candidates in 15 Orange County 
school board races this fall and creating the first-ever countywide network of 
conservative school board hopefuls. 
</P>
<P>
 Financed mostly by two conservative longtime philanthropists, John Crean and 
Howard F. Ahmanson Jr., the Tustin-based Education Alliance collected more than 
$36,000 this month and has used the money to help conservative candidates 
contact absentee voters, distribute campaign literature and plot strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night, the organization joined with the local Republican Party for a 
$100-a-plate fund-raiser celebrating the 30th anniversary of Ronald Reagan's 
first political speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "The education establishment is trying to turn our schools into laboratories 
of social experiments. We don't like that," said Mark Bucher, a 35-year-old 
Tustin resident who runs the Education Alliance out of the offices of his 
construction company. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conservatives aren't even in the game," Bucher added. "We want to get 
them in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Education activists and moderate Republicans warned that the Educational 
Alliance's emergence is part of a growing trend of activism in local races by 
religious and extremist groups. Some expressed fear that the conservative 
candidates the group supports want to destroy public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "The danger here is that their whole mission and purpose is anti-public 
education," said Elizabeth Parker, a county Board of Education member for the 
past 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the Education Alliance's roots in the 1993 campaign for Proposition 
174, which would have given parents vouchers to spend at private, parochial or 
public schools, Parker said: "The bottom line is they want to weaken the public 
school system to where it doesn't help anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Bucher denied any connection between his group and the religious right, saying 
he does not even know the religious views of most of the candidates his 
organization funds. The Education Alliance's chief "battle cry," Bucher said, 
is to increase local control of schools and give parents more power. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergence of a group of conservative candidates connected across district 
lines has brought one of the conflicts plaguing the national Republican Party 
down to a local level. Most of the candidates receiving money from the 
Education Alliance were also endorsed by the right-wing California Republican 
Assembly. But many are trying to unseat Republicans, which irks the party's 
moderate wing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to fight the Democrats on the left side and the extremist wackos on 
the right. We're having a hell of a time, getting shot from both sides," 
complained Roger Hughes, a public school teacher who chairs the Orange County 
chapter of the moderate California Republican League. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of good Republicans on the school boards now," Hughes said. 
"There appears to be a deliberate decision by the extremists within the 
Republican Party to try to replace all those people, as they (are) . . . trying 
to set up a theocracy." 
</P>
<P>
 In general, candidates backed by the Education Alliance oppose federal and 
state curriculum guidelines and want a "back to basics" approach to education 
that emphasizes American values rather than multiculturalism, Bucher said. 
</P>
<P>
 They oppose curriculum reforms and exams such as the California Learning 
Assessment System; support abstinence-only sex education; reject any effort to 
establish health clinics or distribute condoms on campus; and believe 
creationism and evolution should be both taught as "theories" rather than sure 
facts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody seems to think there's some kind of ulterior motive behind this. 
There's not," Bucher said. "Everybody's trying to say we're the religious 
right, and we're not. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that schools exist to assist parents in the education of their 
children. We want to return the schools to the parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Jon H. Soeder, a Tustin Unified candidate who has received nearly $1,300 from 
the Educational Alliance and attended its campaign seminars, said the PAC is 
not "this huge, cohesive group" but "just some concerned people getting 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 "It (is) really quite nice," Soeder said. "It's very refreshing because 
sometimes you think you're the only one." 
</P>
<P>
 The Education Alliance has no religious affiliation, but its agenda is similar 
to those of the Christian Coalition, the Traditional Values Coalition and 
Citizens for Excellence in Education, three conservative national Christian 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's become unpopular to align yourself with CEE and TVC, so rather than 
directly associating themselves, you find organizations are distancing 
themselves even though they have the same agenda," said Jean Hessburg, 
California director of the liberal organization People for the American Way. 
"The agenda is antithetical to public education, period." 
</P>
<P>
 Bucher said his group wants to "save" public schools from liberal forces such 
as teachers unions, which for years have donated money to candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 A loose group of volunteers who met during the failed Prop. 174 campaign, the 
Education Alliance has run campaign seminars for candidates, paid to put their 
names on two conservative voter slate-mailers, and supplied postage for 
mailings to absentee voters. 
</P>
<P>
 According to campaign finance statements for the period from Oct. 1 to Oct. 
22, Ahmanson gave the Education Alliance $20,000 and Crean gave the group 
$10,000. A handful of others gave smaller contributions for a total of $36,234 
since the campaign began. 
</P>
<P>
 Bucher said organizers did not expect to raise nearly that much money.  
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson is a Christian fundamentalist banking heir who heads Fieldstead & Co. 
in Irvine. He was one of the original members of the Allied PAC founded by 
businessman Rob Hurtt, now a Republican state senator representing Garden 
Grove, and was a key backer of Prop. 174. Ahmanson gave more than $400,000 to 
the failed effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Crean, a multimillionaire from Newport Beach who heads the recreational 
vehicle company Fleetwood Enterprises Inc., is well-known for his cable 
television cooking show and the many charity events he and his wife host at 
their Santa Ana Heights mansion. Conservative Coalition

LOVED ONES HONORED ON DAY OF THE DEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Magdalena Bravo, 67, of Santa Ana and her younger brother used to dance, go to 
the beach and cook in her kitchen together, until cancer ended his life eight 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loved me just like a mother, not a sister, and I loved him just like a 
son," Bravo said. "We were very close." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, those fond memories came flooding back as Bravo and more than 600 
people from Orange County Catholic churches paid homage to their loved ones 
during their annual Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) celebration. The 
holiday is celebrated Nov. 2, All Souls' Day, but church leaders said they 
marked it Saturday so more people could attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though death separates us from our loved ones, our faith in Jesus Christ 
allows us to be together," said Msgr. Jaime Soto. "All Souls' Day remembers 
individuals that have gone on before us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Day of the Dead is a family affair where relatives visit and clean their 
relatives' grave sites, offering the deceased his or her favorite foods. They 
also spend the night burning incense, dancing and picnicking at the grave 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's four-hour celebration in the Holy Sepulcher Cemetery began at noon 
with a procession and ended with dances from groups in traditional Aztec and 
Mexican dress. Soto said Mass while people sat on chairs in the midst of the 
graves. 
</P>
<P>
 With his head bowed, Mike Castro, 68, of Orange remembered his wife of 40 
years, who died two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I miss her," Castro said with a shrug. "She died during dialysis. Today is 
the day to pay my respects." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from reciting the rosary during the procession, Castro and others walked 
solemnly into the cemetery where a Mass was said. On the altars were bright 
yellow and orange flowers, crosses and figurines of saints. 
</P>
<P>
 Their offerings included apples, sweetbread made for this occasion and a 
bottle of whiskey. Some quietly wept; others sang with the priests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today is a celebration of Christ," Soto said. "Pray for the victims of 
violence. Pray for their families and pray for each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Soto also briefly spoke against Proposition 187, the state ballot initiative 
that would deny social services, public education and all but emergency medical 
care to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 During his speech, Socorro Quezada stood in the back, muffling her sobs with a 
handkerchief. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have my daughter over there," said the 57-year-old Fullerton resident, 
pointing to the graves behind her. "Someone strangled her five years ago. She 
would've been 25 today. The world is crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing so many family and friends together actually comforted some of those 
people who recently lost a loved one. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugo Hernandez, 18, of Santa Ana sought shade under the trees where the Mass 
was said. He and his cousin, Carmen Gutierrez, 27, of Santa Ana, shared fond 
memories of Hernandez's father, who died a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the celebration) is good," Hernandez said. "Today is special. My 
father was the only thing I had." 
</P>
<P>
 Soto started the Day of the Dead celebration for Orange County's large Latino 
population four years ago. Saturday's celebration was sponsored by the Diocese 
of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's visiting the dead one special day during the year and having the food 
they used to like and thinking that they're there partaking in it," said 
Juanamaria Amezquita of Orange. "That we are together at least once a year. 
That's the way to remember the dead."

NATURE'S OPEN HOUSE; STARR RANCH OFFERS A RARE LOOK AT A TRULY WILD PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pete DeSimone, manager of the Starr Ranch Sanctuary, watched with slightly 
narrowed eyes Saturday morning as cars began filling up an open meadow. Nearby, 
vendors hawked T-shirts and soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a little strange," DeSimone said softly, leaning against a flatbed 
truck. "This place is usually so quiet. But I expect the deer will be back a 
half-hour after it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in more than 20 years, the National Audubon Society opened 
the 4,000-acre wilderness preserve to the public Saturday, offering about 500 
nature lovers a rare glimpse of unspoiled Southern California terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 A diverse ecosystem of dense, wooded canyons and sprawling, golden hills, 
Starr Ranch Sanctuary is a wilderness laboratory. Typically, the only visitors 
there are wildlife researchers and an occasional tour of Audubon members. 
</P>
<P>
 "This open house is a goodwill offer to the public," said Audubon spokesman 
Ken Fortune. "Starr Ranch is a beautiful place and this is the kind of day we 
want people to remember when they go home." 
</P>
<P>
 After a slightly overcast start, the sun smiled on visitors the rest of the 
day as they set off on guided walking tours of the sanctuary. They learned 
about ecologically threatened coastal sage vegetation, a class of low-growing 
plants that clings to steep foothills and cliffs in semiarid Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a good day for bird-watching. Yellow rump warblers, blue jays, 
dark-eyed junkos and many other species dotted the tops of tall thistles and 
sang from sprawling sycamore and oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the deer did take cover, some of the bolder residents of the 
sanctuary came out to play. An Audubon volunteer found a dusky, brown tarantula 
ambling slowly along the ground near sanctuary headquarters. He let the 
arachnid crawl up his arm and held it high as a crowd gathered. 
</P>
<P>
 With a look of fear, Stacy Strain hesitantly extended her hand toward the 
tarantula. Her expression shifted from wonder as, one hairy segmented leg at a 
time, the spider stepped gently onto her palm. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's so light," the Dana Point resident said incredulously. "It's like having 
a breath of air walk on you." 
</P>
<P>
 At display booths set up by local Audubon chapters, other visitors had close 
encounters with snakes and red-tail hawks, and stroked mountain lion pelts. 
During a lunch break, the group sat down at picnic tables in the Bell Canyon 
meadow and listened as DeSimone described the sanctuary and its mission. He 
stressed that housing developments have caused coastal sage to disappear from 
many areas in Southern California, making the preservation of Starr Ranch 
Sanctuary very important. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are Mediterranean species here that are found nowhere else in the 
world," DeSimone said. "When they're gone, that's it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Mencken and Nancy Dennen of Cypress said they were impressed with what 
they saw at the preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is primitive as primitive can get," Mencken said. "Our kids need to have 
these places preserved in their name. We don't want to have them ask someday, 
'Daddy, what's a tree?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Starr Ranch Sanctuary has been closed to the public since it was donated 
to the National Audubon Society in 1973.  
</P>
<P>
 The National Audubon Society plans to invite the public to return in the 
future. But only when invited. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really glad you're here," DeSimone told the group. "But I hope I don't 
see you hop over the fence with a bicycle after this is over."

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: IS ITO GIVING TOO MUCH CREDIT TO IMPACT OF TV? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At work last week, a colleague wondered how the prospective O.J. Simpson 
jurors will learn about the election campaign since they can't watch 
television, listen to the radio or read the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 The question by Patt Morrison, one of my neighbors in a three-person 
workstation, was intriguing. In the interests of a fair trial, Superior Court 
Judge Lance A. Ito was depriving voters in the jury pool of information needed 
to exercise their right to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 It definitely seemed a case of cutting off a nose to spite a face. And 
certainly a perfect example of the law of unintended consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 I called Jerrianne Hayslett of the court press office and asked her about it. 
She said she'd talk to Ito. The next day, she got back to me. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito, she said, thanked me for bringing the question to his attention. He 
hadn't thought of it. He had a solution. Could The Times put together packets 
of pre-election stories for the jury pool? 
</P>
<P>
 I asked our managing editor, who thought it was a good idea. Our library is 
now compiling election stories back to Oct. 20, and we'll keep the news flowing 
to the jurors every day. The Daily News is doing the same. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury panel may end up being California's best informed voters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The incident got me thinking about the judge, and his relationship to the jury 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been clear from the beginning that he's someone who firmly believes he 
can control events, that his power extends beyond his courtroom, beyond the 
courthouse, into the homes, workplaces and minds of the jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 There is another facet of Judge Ito that is shaping the trial as well. He is, 
as he noted to a juror one day, a child of the television generation. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of this was noted last week by Linda Deutsch of the Associated 
Press, one of the pool reporters in the courtroom. "Judge Ito has this 
incredible knowledge of popular culture," she said. "He knows all the shows, 
the games, the scores. I don't know where he has the time. He tries to keep up 
with everything." 
</P>
<P>
 This, Deutsch said, put him on the same wavelength as many of the prospective 
jurors, who are also movie, television and sports fans. "He has great rapport 
with the jurors," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That helped me understand why he is so intent on controlling the jurors' 
relationship with popular culture, why he kicked one prospect out for watching 
an old Barbara Stanwyck movie on television, and another for watching 
videotaped episodes of "Beverly Hills 90210" and "Melrose Place." 
</P>
<P>
 I can visualize him rising early to catch "Good Morning America" and staying 
up late for Jay Leno, David Letterman (Ito is probably a channel switcher) and 
even Conan O'Brien, whose show begins at 12:35 a.m. As one lawyer told me, 
"They ought to sequester the judge." 
</P>
<P>
 Because he's absorbed in it, I bet Ito thinks all this popular culture has a 
powerful impact on people. Only that could explain his admonition that 
prospective jurors have no exposure to any media, no matter what the subject. 
He must believe a Leno monologue or "Melrose Place" episode can have a powerful 
impact, or that a sentence or a fleeting glance of Simpson case news will 
pollute the jurors' minds. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't how most people think. I watch "NYPD Blue" all the time and waste 
many hours viewing sports. But except to get mad when a favorite team loses, or 
when David Caruso quits his Detective John Kelly role on "NYPD Blue," I don't 
take it seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people don't. Our lives are crowded with family, work, social activities, 
sports, religion, school and the rest. In that mix, "Melrose Place" doesn't 
have much clout. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to believe a judge is worrying about all this. You think of judges 
as big-picture people. Instead, Ito is getting involved in the smallest details 
of the jury panelists' TV habits. That's what parents are supposed to worry 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 This is making things hard on the jury panel. "I'm not happy because I want to 
vote," a Brentwood woman told Ito in complaining about the news blackout. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito assured her that election news packets were on the way. He also has 
promised to ease the media restrictions somewhat within the next two weeks. But 
with his strict, all-encompassing restrictions, I'm sure something else will 
crop up soon.

FOUR STUDENTS GET THE ASSIGNMENT OF A LIFETIME; SIMPSON CASE: A PROFESSOR AND 
JUDGE LANCE A. ITO SELECTED THE ASPIRING LAWYERS TO SERVE AS CLERKS, OFFERING 
THEM SOME PRIME RESUME-BUILDING AND A FEW MOMENTS IN THE SPOTLIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was like offering a team of Little Leaguers a chance to play in the World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bernard Kamins asked the 10 students in his trial advocacy class which of 
them wanted to help out on the O. J. Simpson case, 10 hands shot eagerly into 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months later, three of the students, along with a gutsy young woman from 
Arcadia, are players in what some have called the "trial of the century." 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Moran, Paul Tyler and Steve Golob -- all second- or third-year students 
at Pepperdine University School of Law -- and Tasia Scolinos, a walk-in 
applicant, are law clerks for Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito during 
Simpson's double murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 For nothing more than a few school credits and the sheer exhilaration of it -- 
along with a great entry on their resumes -- they do research for Ito and 
perform tasks such as organizing juror questionnaires, copying documents and 
running errands. 
</P>
<P>
 At the start of the trial, the well-dressed and poised quartet of law clerks 
were a bit of a mystery to court watchers. They obviously had some official 
connection to the case; Ito was allowing them into his chambers regularly, and 
they often sat together in the usually off-limits jury box. It was several days 
before their role became known. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, they are familiar fixtures in the courtroom. Ito often summons them from 
the audience to do his bidding. One has been designated to baby-sit reporters 
as they look over questionnaires submitted by potential jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They are on familiar terms with the case's big-name lawyers and view them as 
living textbooks on courtroom demeanor and strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I felt intimidated," Tyler said. "It was like 3-D. It was like you 
were still watching it on TV, but you were sitting right there." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he and the others have become more comfortable with their role and are 
even enjoying some on-campus celebrity. "People come up to you and say, 'I 
heard you're working on the Simpson case,' " Tyler said. "You're not just some 
anonymous law student." 
</P>
<P>
 Kamins, an adjunct law professor at Pepperdine who also is a Superior Court 
judge and a friend of Ito's, called Moran, Tyler and Golob "the pick of the 
litter" among his students at the Malibu campus. 
</P>
<P>
 And Tasia Scolinos . . . well, Tasia Scolinos is in a class of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent Claremont-McKenna College graduate and law school hopeful decided 
early on that Ito would need her assistance, and -- out of the blue -- sent him 
her resume. It was the only unsolicited application he received. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito called her himself to let her know she was in. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're not assertive and take some risks, you can really miss out on some 
incredible benefits," the 22-year-old said matter-of-factly last week. 
</P>
<P>
 That same sort of assertiveness landed her an internship in the British 
Parliament two years ago when she was studying government as an undergraduate 
at Claremont-McKenna. Scolinos came up with the idea, found a program and 
talked her advisers into approving it. 
</P>
<P>
 Scolinos got her first taste of fame, however, on the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Ito handed her a $20 bill in the middle of a Simpson 
hearing and sent her rushing to a nearby bookstore to buy him a copy of "Nicole 
Brown Simpson: The Private Diary of a Life Interrupted" -- the splashy book 
that shut down jury selection for two days. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler also has had his 15 minutes of fame. 
</P>
<P>
 During one televised court session, Ito, addressing him as "Mr. Tyler," 
summoned the 28-year-old Camarillo native from the audience to the bench and, 
on camera, privately asked him to go research the point of law that was under 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A legal expert providing commentary for the live television coverage of the 
session apparently mistook the law clerk for a member of the police force. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Well, evidently Detective Tyler is going to testify,' " Tyler recalls the 
commentator intoning. 
</P>
<P>
 The other law clerks found that amusing -- and revealing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He couldn't have been much of a legal expert if he thought a witness was up 
there having a sidebar with the judge," Scolinos scoffed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Kamins' idea to draft a corps of student volunteers for the Simpson 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, he said, he gives his students courtroom experience by arranging 
internships for them with prosecutors or public defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he presided briefly over the case of four Los Angeles police officers 
accused of beating Rodney G. King before that trial was moved to Simi Valley, 
he allowed some of his students to assist him. 
</P>
<P>
 They worked out so well, Kamins said, that he approached Ito about doing 
something similar in the Simpson case and got his approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prosecutors had an army of lawyers to assist them and the defense 
certainly had an army of lawyers," Kamins said. "All Lance had was Lance." 
(Actually, the judge also has a research attorney, Rick Ocampo, and his regular 
courtroom clerk, Deirdre Robertson.) 
</P>
<P>
 With the extra volunteer help, "Lance benefits and the students benefit," 
Kamins said. 
</P>
<P>
 The beneficial effects are not lost on Moran, 24, a Cornell University 
graduate who has worked in the San Francisco district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got great resume value," said Moran, who hopes to practice criminal law. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler, who did his undergraduate work at Pepperdine majoring in English and 
religion, and who spent a year studying in Germany, said the Simpson case has 
made him aware of interests he didn't know he had. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the case, he said, he has become fascinated with scientific 
evidence. He currently is writing an article on the subject that has been 
accepted for publication in a Pepperdine law journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Scolinos, who plans to start law school in the fall of 1995 but hasn't decided 
on her specialty, is using the stint in Ito's courtroom to "establish a good 
foundation" for law school. She is already learning skills, she said, that most 
other prospective law students won't learn until much later, such as how to use 
sophisticated computer programs to do legal research. 
</P>
<P>
 Golob, who before law school spent a year doing humanitarian work in Sarajevo, 
said he, too, is grateful to see firsthand the practical application of the law 
in such a high-profile case. 
</P>
<P>
 But he acknowledges that the pressure on everyone, including the law clerks, 
is great. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you make a mistake," he said, "the press is here to see it. Judge Ito 
relies on information we supply him with, so we can't do sloppy research." 
</P>
<P>
 And none of them wants to do anything to embarrass Ito, for whom they have 
nothing but praise. 
</P>
<P>
 "On my first day, I expected him to be highly focused and stressed and tense 
because of the immensity of the case," Tyler said. "I figured it would be 
engulfing him. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I found is that he's a completely relaxed guy, focused, certainly, and 
takes it seriously, (but) he likes his job a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Those remarks were echoed by Golob, who called Ito "very mellow." 
</P>
<P>
 "He really takes the time out to talk to us and goes out of his way to make 
sure we're doing OK," Scolinos added. "At the end of every day, he usually 
talks to us in his chambers. Every day he asks us 'What did you learn today?' "

HARD KNOCKS REUNION; FOR 'TEMPLE STREET KIDS,' LESSONS OF HARDSHIP AND 
FRIENDSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 They could have been talking about today. 
</P>
<P>
 But those telling of immigrant parents, childhood poverty and growing up among 
struggling storefronts at the edge of Downtown were talking of 1934 -- not 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys of Temple Street were back in the neighborhood for a reunion 
Saturday. And memories for Los Angeles' original inner-city youths were sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 The 42 men are mostly in their 70s now and they came from as far as Las Vegas 
to eat a chicken and pot roast lunch at Les Freres Taix French restaurant and 
rekindle friendships interrupted half a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Their old neighborhood is gone. The Hollywood and Harbor freeways gobbled up 
much of the place -- the four-level interchange wiped out their beloved Custer 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 High-rise office buildings have replaced the crumbling Victorian mansions on 
Bunker Hill that were used as boarding houses and passed at the time as the 
city's affordable housing. Apartments and newer commercial buildings have taken 
the place of most clapboard houses and brick-fronted shops. 
</P>
<P>
 But the lessons of shared hardship -- and true friendship -- have survived.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were all first-generation immigrants," said Marvin Marsh, a USC psychiatry 
professor who now lives on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pacific Asians, Hispanics, Filipinos, Jews, Koreans, African Americans. You 
name it, we had it. The neighborhood was a melting pot. We all had a common 
interest: to get along and be good Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody there was poor, I can tell you that," said Chuda (Jerry) Rhee, a 
former hospital administrator from Northridge who recalled that one of his 
proudest moments in life was the day a Jewish friend's mother said he was "her 
third son." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Morrie Greenberg, a retired junior high principal from North Hlls, said 
children growing up along Temple Street in the '30s and '40s never paid 
attention to ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "You looked at people as your neighbor and your friend. Only later did you 
realize that guy was Mexican, or that guy spoke with an Italian accent," 
Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Central American street vendors who these days hawk bags of oranges along 
Temple Street reminded Ralph Arouh of 63 years ago. That was when he and his 
brothers helped build a produce stand out of scrap lumber that was eventually 
parlayed into a commercial meat business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very similar to today," said Arouh, of Tarzana. "People have to make a 
living." 
</P>
<P>
 His brother, Isaac (Turk) Arouh, an office supply salesman who lives in 
Beverly Hills, said the Temple Street neighborhood -- bounded by Figueroa and 
3rd streets, Sunset Boulevard and Echo Park Avenue -- was a comfortable place 
to grow up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could see the shadow of City Hall coming down Temple Street. But you felt 
like you were living in a small town," said Arouh, who organized Saturday's 
reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 The old-timers laughed over the old days. Archie Lifland, a retired Burbank 
teacher who works as volunteer youth sports coach in Lincoln Heights, hugged 
Louis Smith of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy had the only car in the neighborhood and he'd take us to the beach. 
That's why we became friends," Lifland joked. 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Resnick, a retired real estate broker who lives in Van Nuys, was kidded 
about the time neighborhood boys sent him to Chinatown to buy firecrackers -- 
only to be stopped on the way home by police, who confiscated the contraband. 
</P>
<P>
 David Goldstein, now a Las Vegas resident, recalled how he and neighborhood 
chum Mendel Fontes ventured over Bunker Hill into Downtown and discovered a 
group of sailors beating a Latino youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Fontes, now of Pico Rivera, stepped forward "and knocked a sailor out with one 
punch," Goldstein said. The other assailants fled. "Mendel taught me something 
that day I never forgot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those at the reunion passed around a history book picture of Francis Temple, a 
banker who died in 1880 and for whom Temple Street is named. They vowed to get 
together again next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud to be from here," said Mort Rogo, the only member of the Temple 
Street boys who still lives in the neighborhood. These days, however, he lives 
in a posh 31st-floor unit of the Bunker Hill Towers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a poverty-stricken area then. And a lot of it still is," Rogo said. 
"But we're cosmopolitan now."

NEIGHBORS COME OUT TO RECLAIM THE STREETS; COMMUNITIES: RESIDENTS OF 
GANG-TROUBLED SANTA ANA AREA HAVE CARNIVAL WHERE THEY ONCE FEARED TO TREAD. 
THEY SAY IT'S A START.

 In a city park long ago abandoned to drug dealers and gang members, about 300 
residents gathered for a carnival Saturday to lunch on carne asada and 
hamburgers, play games for prizes and learn more about city services that can 
help them reclaim their streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if more of us get together more often for our community, we can 
defeat the drugs and the bad guys," said Irma Torres, a mother of three 
children, 6, 15 and 17. 
</P>
<P>
 For 23 years, Torres has lived in the neighborhood near 3rd and Flower 
streets, an area recently targeted by police in the massive undercover sweep 
known as "Operation Roundup." 
</P>
<P>
 She said residents have been hesitant to come together in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have all been afraid," she said, browsing through free literature on 
services offered by the city's Corbin Community Center. "It's not right that 
only the bad guys get together to defeat us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Flower Park fair was organized by parents who joined ranks last spring to 
walk their children to school safely at nearby Carver Elementary School. The 
event marked a collective sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Children took crayons to what will soon serve as a wall hanging to sketch the 
neighborhood they one day want. One youngster drew a Boys and Girls Club. 
"Healthy Me Drug Free," another scrawled. Others tried their luck tossing 
beanbags for candy and sported Mickey Mouse ears and Halloween masks that had 
been donated by area businesses. There were plenty of prizes for the 
youngsters, including coupons for free burgers, haircuts and eye exams. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to recover our community. Maybe we won't see it right away or 
next week, but it's working. Hopefully the city will help us," said Armando 
Chacon, who helped organize the fair along with his wife, Soccoro, and about 
two dozen others from the Carver Concerned Parents group. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need some slides and things here for the little kids. We need more lights 
on the streets and to get a community watch group. It's a lot of work, but 
we're going to be OK pretty soon."  
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana Assistance League put on the beanbag toss Saturday and 
volunteers handed out information about the organization's day-care center, 
thrift store and other services. Workers with the city's anti-gang program, 
Project PRIDE, were there too, and Santa Ana police officers showed off a 
cruiser to local youngsters, who got a chance to sit behind the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 But the officers also were there for more serious business. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, park-goers perused a police poster-board that displayed 
photos of more than a dozen Operation Roundup suspects still at large since the 
Sept. 7 sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 "Help the Police and Your Community. Can You Identify Any of These Criminals?" 
read the poster board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw that guy," one small boy told an officer Saturday, pointing at one of 
the photos. "He was riding a bike on Bristol Street." 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials say they tried the same tactic at a carnival organized by a 
community businessman at the park last week and received enough tips from 
residents to make a handful of arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of Operation Roundup, city officials have pledged their help for 
the 3rd Street neighborhood, long claimed by what police described as one of 
the city's most dangerous gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, fear of bullets and brazen robberies kept many residents cloistered 
inside their homes, suspicious of their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 John Chacon, 9, a fourth-grader at Carver Elementary School, designed the 
winning logo for vests the Carver parents will soon sport while walking the 
children to school. He said he never used to play outside and couldn't enjoy 
the park before now. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was full of gangs and kids getting hurt. My mom wouldn't let me go 
outside," he said of his neighborhood. "Now I know it's going to change because 
the Carver Concerned Parents are going to stop the violence." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, city neighborhood improvement workers showed up at the park to 
encourage residents to form a neighborhood association and gather suggestions 
about what services are needed there. The city also donated a stage for a 
string of local performers who tap-danced, spun cartwheels and played an 
eclectic blend of Cajun and ranchero music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's long overdue," said Zelenne Cardenas, director of Project 
SABADO, a county-funded alcohol and drug education group that has worked with 
the Carver parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these residents have lived in this neighborhood for 16 years, and 
they've been waiting to use that park for a very long time. Now they can."

DISNEYLAND, UNION REACH TENTATIVE PACT; LABOR: THE AGREEMENT LIKELY ENDS THE 
THREAT OF A STRIKE. FOOD SERVICE WORKERS ARE TO VOTE ON THE OFFER TODAY.

<P>
 Negotiators for Disneyland and the union that represents 1,600 food service 
workers reached a tentative agreement late Saturday, likely ending the threat 
of a strike this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good package, there's no takeaways," said Angela Keefe, president of 
the Hotel and Restaurant Employees Local 681. "I feel great. I just need a 
little sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Disneyland and Local 681 concluded talks at 10:30 p.m. Saturday 
after meeting nearly continuously since Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland's three-year contract with Local 681 expires at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. 
But the deadline for hammering out a settlement was early today, when union 
members are scheduled to vote on the tentative three-year agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Keefe said the union's 18-member bargaining committee unanimously agreed to 
recommend approval of the proposal to its members. 
</P>
<P>
 The union was successful in blocking the company's attempt to create a 
two-tier wage structure and also obtained a concession that will prohibit the 
company from subcontracting with non-union workers, Keefe said. The two issues 
had held up the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides, which have been meeting since early September, had planned to 
conclude talks late Friday but were unable to reach a deal until late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland officials have declined to comment about negotiations. Company 
spokesmen could not be reached Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the union, Disneyland was proposing that wages for new employees 
hired after Nov. 1 be capped at $7.50 an hour. Currently, the top rate for most 
of the union food-service workers at Disneyland is about $9 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The union was also seeking to obtain contract language that would prohibit 
Disneyland from subcontracting, an issue that emerged this summer when the 
company took steps to farm out some union jobs to an outside vendor. 
</P>
<P>
 After protests from the union, Disneyland halted its plan but said it had been 
considering subcontracting in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland's contract with Local 681 covers about 700 full- and part-time 
workers who prepare, serve and ring up food, and bus tables at the theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional 900 so-called "casual employees" -- those who work fewer than 20 
hours a week -- are also governed by the pact.  
</P>
<P>
 The union workers represent nearly 20% of Disneyland's work force. A strike by 
them could seriously hamper operations at the park, which is coming off a weak 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Union workers are scheduled to vote at 10 a.m., 4 and 7:30 p.m. at the Grand 
Hotel, across the street from Disneyland. Ballots will be counted after the 
last voting session.

POLITICS '94: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; 
187'S PRINCE A PAUPER? CAMPAIGN LOAN STUCK IN CREDIT-CREDIBILITY GAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Perils of Prince: As the relatively unknown co-chairman for Proposition 
187, the immigration initiative, Tustin accountant Ron S. Prince claimed in an 
interview in early August that he lent the campaign $20,000 because he believed 
in the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, caught in a legal fight with his former attorney who is seeking payment 
for a $9,600 legal bill, Prince is claiming he didn't make the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue came up last week in an Orange County courtroom, where Prince's 
former attorney, William Baker of Santa Ana, challenged Prince's assertion that 
he has no assets. Baker argued that if Prince could lend $20,000 to the 
Proposition 187 campaign, then he should be able to pay his outstanding legal 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 But Prince told the judge that the cashier's check for the loan came from his 
father, Downey businessman Leland Prince, and that the campaign treasurer had 
incorrectly listed him as the lender. The judge ordered Prince to produce a 
copy of the cashier's check. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign treasurer Betty Presley said she was unaware of the error until 
Prince made his admission in court. The day after the hearing, Presley filed a 
campaign finance amendment listing Leland Prince as the lender, but she said 
she's also waiting for Ron Prince's copy of the check. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Fair Political Practices Commission says the law requires that 
both the lender and the intermediary, in this case Ron Prince, must be listed 
on the campaign reports and that "failure to do so could amount to the campaign 
laundering money." 
</P>

 High Cost of Votes: A recent memo from Democratic Assembly kingpin Willie 
Brown laid out the cost of registering new voters in tightly contested races. 
Among the most expensive was Orange County's 69th Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's memo said Democrats spent more than $85,000 to sign up 9,582 new 
voters, which translates to $9.12 a voter. The only district in the state where 
voter registration cost more per person was San Diego's 80th Assembly District 
at $9.29. Statewide, the average was $5.95 a voter. The Democrats' effort in 
the 69th should pay dividends for standard-bearer Mike Metzler, who is in a 
tough battle with Republican Jim Morrissey. The seat is the only state or 
federal office the Democrats have held in Orange County in recent memory, and 
the departure of Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) to run for attorney 
general has left the party in a testy position. 
</P>
<P>
 As pricey as the registration effort was, it did increase the Democrats' voter 
advantage by 4.5%, the biggest percentage jump anywhere in the state. Democrats 
now hold a 56.1% to 34.3% edge over Republicans. 
</P>

<P>
 To Endorse or Not Endorse: After 14 years on the Capistrano Unified School 
District Board of Trustees, Annette B. Gude has made a lot of friends. Steeling 
herself for the upcoming election battle against challenger Dorsey Brause, a 
conservative Christian who heads the South County chapter of the California 
Republican Assembly, Gude collected a string of endorsements from state 
lawmakers she has worked with. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week, Gil Ferguson took back his vote of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson has known Gude for a decade and gave her his stamp of approval early 
in the campaign. But the Newport Beach assemblyman--who plans to run next year 
for the state Senate--unendorsed her after Gude issued a recent press release 
warning that the "religious right" was trying to take over the Capistrano 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't feel I should be endorsing someone who is going to rail against 
somebody because of their religion," said Ferguson, whose office was flooded 
with complaints from Brause supporters after word of the Gude press release 
spread. "A person I was endorsing was doing something I thought was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Outraged, Gude responded with another fiery press release, saying she was 
"disappointed" in Ferguson and repeating her concerns about the religious 
right's intent "to take over (Capistrano Unified) and indeed every school board 
in the nation."

CAMPAIGN '94: ISSUES AND ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two candidates are running in the Nov. 8 election for the Second District seat 
on the Orange County Board of Supervisors. They are Huntington Beach Mayor 
Linda Moulton Patterson and Huntington Beach Councilman Jim Silva. Here's how 
they stand on four issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you favor or oppose development of a commercial airport at El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station? 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson: "I support the highest and best use of the El Toro MCAS 
area. Assuming that the environmental and land-use reports, as well as the 
economic development studies, show that a commercial airport at El Toro is 
viable, then I will support it. Orange County has rapidly become a large 
community that needs its own airport to allow us to resume our economic growth 
and provide jobs for our county." 
</P>
<P>
 Silva: "A commercial airport appears to be the best use for El Toro. It would 
bring new jobs and new tax revenues into the county, and it would facilitate 
our efforts to make Orange County a business gateway to the rapidly expanding 
Pacific markets." 
</P>
<P>
 How can the county solve jail overcrowding? 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson: "The Board of Supervisors needs to build jails to house 
criminals. Sites have been identified at both the James A. Musick facility in 
South County and also in Santa Ana. However, for too long the board has played 
politics with this issue. Consequently, taxpayers will pay millions of dollars 
more to construct the jail facilities we need and, even more important, 
families have been victimized by criminals who were released too soon because 
there was not a jail cell available due to overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva: "Additional jail space needs to be constructed to house those who 
commit crimes in Orange County. I favor new jail construction, either at the 
current site in downtown Santa Ana or at a rural site away from homes and 
schools. I strongly oppose the early release of criminals to relieve 
overcrowding." 
</P>
<P>
 How should the Bolsa Chica wetlands be developed? 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson: "My first choice would be for a land trade between the 
Department of the Interior and the Koll Co. of the entire Bolsa Chica. If this 
failed, I would accept only development that would do the least environmental 
damage and cause the least traffic congestion, with maximum effort to restore 
and preserve the wetlands." 
</P>
<P>
 Silva: "I support preservation of the wetlands and responsible development by 
the landowners in the area. I support the compromise development plan put 
together by Amigos de Bolsa Chica." 
</P>
<P>
 What is your position on Proposition 187? 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson: "I support Proposition 187 as a means of sending a message 
to the federal government that it must provide funding and help in 
strengthening our border and in providing funding for services provided to 
illegal immigrants locally. I don't believe, however, that our public school 
teachers should be turned into border guards. I am also concerned about what 
will happen to school-age children who are left out on our streets. Proposition 
187 is not the answer, it is more of a warning signal." 
</P>
<P>
 Silva: "I strongly support Proposition 187 and have worked as a city 
councilman to stop taxpayers' funds from going to pay for benefits for illegal 
aliens. People who break our laws should not be rewarded with free government 
services."

2 RALLIES BACK OPPOSING SIDES OF DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The fierce debate over Proposition 187 continued to rage Saturday as opposing 
sides staged well-attended rallies to drum up support. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would deny non-emergency health care, education and social 
services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 At noon, about 200 people attended an anti-Proposition 187 rally at the Santa 
Ana Civic Center that was organized by Students Against SOS (Save Our State).  
</P>
<P>
 "(Proposition 187) opens the door to the beginning of a police state in a 
nation that continues to be democratic," said Zeke Hernandez, past state 
president of the League of United Latin American Citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, more than 300 people crowded into a meeting room at the Holiday Inn in 
Buena Park for a pro-Proposition 187 event sponsored by United We Stand. Ron S. 
Prince, an author of the controversial measure, received a standing ovation 
when he was introduced. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-El Cajon) and Ed Royce (R-Fullerton), and Assemblyman 
Richard L. Mountjoy (R-Arcadia) also spoke in favor of the measure.

HOUSE CANDIDATES SPLIT ALONG PARTY LINES OVER PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Debate on the best way to stem illegal immigration into California split along 
party lines Saturday at a gathering of most of the county's congressional 
candidates at Rancho Santiago College. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans backed Proposition 187 to end social services, education and all 
but emergency health care to illegal immigrants.Democrats favored military 
patrols of the U.S.-Mexico border and vigorous enforcement of employer 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Victor A. Wagner Jr., a Libertarian candidate running for the seat in the 
47th Congressional District argued that most Americans don't want the 
low-paying jobs. "If illegals disappear, the cost of lettuce would double in a 
month or so," Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum, organized by the Concord Coalition of Orange County and United We 
Stand, also focused on congressional accountability and the federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of Huntington Beach suggested 
eliminating government support for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, 
which led his Democratic challenger in the 45th District, Brett Williamson, to 
bemoan having to tell his daughter that Sesame Street might be "on the chopping 
block." 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrabacher replied: "I'm sorry, but taxpayers can't afford $300 million a 
year to keep Big Bird alive."  
</P>
<P>
 On Proposition 187, Gary Kingsbury, the Democratic challenger to Republican 
Rep. Christopher Cox in the 47th District, said it will foster juvenile 
delinquency. "If you think you have a gang problem now, wait until after 187 
passes," he said. Kingsbury said he believes the military should become more 
involved in stopping immigrants from crossing the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox, who favors Proposition 187, said the Democratic strategy of enforcing 
employment laws would make it harder for undocumented immigrants to get work -- 
but would allow them to stay in the state. "Prop. 187 doesn't touch any illegal 
immigrant who works," he said.

CAR WASH NETS $1,000 FOR GIRL'S FUNERAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than $1,000 was raised Saturday at a car wash to help pay for the funeral 
of a 15-year-old Collister Natis Stinson, who police said was fatally wounded 
by her father. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 teen-agers, all friends of Natis, the middle name the teenager was 
known by, washed more than 50 vehicles from 9 a.m. to nightfall, said Trina 
Filbey, who organized the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers will wash cars again today at the Mesa Verde Shell Station at 3131 
Harbor Blvd., she said.  
</P>
<P>
 There is no set price for the car wash, and drivers made donations of various 
sizes Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that David Curtis Stinson shot his daughter apparently while 
cleaning his gun inside their Costa Mesa apartment. He was arrested on 
suspicion of murder Thursday and remained at the Costa Mesa Jail on Saturday.

2 ROB AND BEAT ORANGE BUSINESSMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 58-year-old man was robbed and beaten by two assailants Saturday morning as 
he prepared to open his downtown business. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the two men took $2,000 in cash from Arsa Riston about 8:20 a.m., 
then pistol-whipped and kicked him outside the Universal Electric Motor Co. at 
Collins Avenue and Cypress Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Riston told police that the robbery and beating took place as several 
motorists passed by. But they either did not see the incident or did not stop 
to help. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hearing more and more of that these days," Police Sgt. Bob Green said. 
"People just don't want to get involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Riston suffered jaw and nose injuries but was not taken to a 
hospital. Green said the victim was carrying a large amount of money because he 
intended to purchase equipment for his business later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not known whether Riston was a random target for the robbery or whether 
the bandits were aware that the businessman was carrying the cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects were described as black men in their mid-20s, about 6 feet tall 
and weighing 200 pounds. They fled in a blue Buick Regal.

BOY CRITICALLY HURT WHEN CAR STRIKES HIM IN DRIVEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 1 1/2-year-old boy was in critical condition Saturday after being hit by a 
car while playing in a neighbor's driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbor was apparently backing away from the garage on Regalo Drive about 
9:30 a.m. when Matthew Zona was struck, said Lt. Rex Hatch of the Orange County 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatch said the driver apparently was not aware that the toddler had been hit 
and continued away from the home without stopping. The child suffered head 
injuries and was taken to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center, where he 
was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. 
</P>
<P>
 A next-door neighbor, who asked not to be identified, said authorities 
inspected her daughter's car Saturday morning when the daughter arrived at work 
in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know how the baby got hit," the neighbor said. "We heard that the 
baby walked back to the house crying after the accident. No one knows what 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Hatch said no charges had been filed in the case and that the investigation is 
continuing.

AID TO THE ABUSED; NEW VAN NUYS POLICE TEAM FOCUSES ON HELPING BATTERED WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over and over again, an angry husband stomped his boot into his wife's face, 
cracking her bones and teeth -- and prompting an emergency call to police. 
</P>
<P>
 The black-and-white rolled up to the couple's Van Nuys apartment minutes 
later, responding to a disturbingly common call that patrol officers dread not 
only for its inherent volatility, but also for the hours it consumes in 
comforting the victim and helping her find treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time, the officers were able to concentrate on police work, because 
traveling behind them was another vehicle from the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Van Nuys Division. Inside this unmarked car were a reserve officer 
and a domestic violence counselor who would tend to the victim, freeing the 
patrol car to respond to other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed the Domestic Violence Response Team, the aides are the first group in 
the Los Angeles Police Department dedicated solely to the treatment of domestic 
violence victims. The six-week-old program reflects the LAPD's new, cooperative 
focus on treating the victims of domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past there has always been two philosophies," said Van Nuys station 
Detective Mitch Robbins, who oversees the team. "The LAPD philosophy is we 
attack the suspects, because we want to put them in jail. The domestic violence 
centers wanted to help the victims. Instead of working together, we were 
working on two sides of the thing. Now these two communities are working 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Van Nuys woman so brutally kicked by her husband, the team could not 
have been created too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was all alone and couldn't talk," said Gail Pincus, a team volunteer who 
also serves as director of the Domestic Abuse Center, a nonprofit group in 
Northridge. Pincus accompanied the battered, semi-conscious woman to Valley 
Hospital in Van Nuys. "We contacted her relatives, filled out financial forms 
to help pay medical bills and provided counseling. This is not a police job. 
They don't have the time." 
</P>
<P>
 The team works weekends, when most domestic violence calls occur. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to Robbins, the mid-Valley area patrolled by the Van Nuys Division 
has more domestic violence arrests than any other Valley division: about 100 a 
week. Countywide, law enforcement agencies respond to more than 70,000 domestic 
violence calls each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new program, regular patrol officers arrive first on the scene. They 
make arrests and take police reports. The Domestic Violence Response Team car 
follows. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's duties include photographing injuries, taking victims to a 
hospital, calling relatives and serving emergency protective orders that 
prevent an attacker from approaching a victim for five days. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 69 times the Domestic Violence Response Team has been sent out during 
the past six weekends, it has issued 25 emergency protective orders and 28 sets 
of photos, relocated 13 people, and given out $125 in food vouchers, Robbins 
said. The patrol car made 21 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, victims of domestic violence no longer have a right to deny 
prosecution. Roughly 77% of men who beat up their wives or girlfriends in Los 
Angeles County are convicted, according to the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The team helps victims cope with the arrest or jailing of their husbands or 
boyfriends. "We help them to think about the things they need to do for 
themselves," said Pincus, who has counseled several families about relocating 
and finding financial assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Other services are designed to put them and their families in a safer 
environment. Because there are only 278 shelter beds for battered women in Los 
Angeles County, Robbins said he arranged for local motels in Van Nuys to 
provide temporary shelter and a local supermarket to provide emergency food. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our calls are the type where she says, 'He beat me, he split, I ain't 
going anywhere, and the kids are upset, but he pays the bills,' " said Suzie 
Caron, a team volunteer and counselor for the Los Angeles Commission on 
Assaults Against Women. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the worst bloody-gory call, but it's the most difficult to deal with 
because they have not been convinced that they both need to change their 
behavior or somebody is going to end up dead," Caron said. "I think just the 
few minutes that a volunteer can give at the scene helps tell a woman that she 
doesn't deserve this." 
</P>
<P>
 The team also tries to teach children that domestic violence is not 
acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to break the cycle," Robbins said. "Part of this whole program is 
designed not to just get to mom and dad, but to get the kids, who are going to 
be the future victims or the batterers themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So far, volunteers have handled nearly every kind of case.  
</P>
<P>
 "There have been women attacked with a machete, attacked with a knife, slashed 
with a broken bottle, choked, punched, hit, slapped, scratched," said volunteer 
Tova Seder, 48, of Sherman Oaks. "Everything you can imagine." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, team members said, victims do not realize how severe their injuries 
are until the patrol car rolls away. LAPD reserve Officer Steve Sposta recalled 
a recent incident in which a 19-year-old woman was attacked by her ex-boyfriend 
while she slept with her 6-month-old baby. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the patrol car left, she kept complaining about ringing in her ears," 
Sposta said. "But she didn't think she needed to be transported to the 
hospital. We talked her into it and found out she had ear damage. Had she not 
been treated, she could have been deaf." 
</P>
<P>
 The case illustrates the importance of having civilians on the team, Robbins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have found is that victims will talk to a volunteer more readily than 
they will talk to a detective," Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. James McMurray, commander of the Van Nuys station, said he is pleased 
that the new program frees up patrol cars to respond to other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our patrol cars used to take one to three hours taking care of domestic 
violence calls," McMurray said. "We were getting wiped out on our response 
time. We were taking an average of eight minutes for all calls. Now we're back 
down to around seven minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 McMurray said he is also impressed that the only program cost has been 
gasoline for the car. The counselors are volunteers and the reserve officers 
are already funded through the LAPD budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Other detective divisions in the LAPD may soon create similar domestic 
violence teams. Detective Rick Papke of the Hollywood Division said he sees the 
team as a perfect supplement to the domestic violence kits his division has 
created. 
</P>
<P>
 The kits, which include cameras, emergency protective orders and contacts for 
battered women's shelters, are now carried in patrol cars in the Hollywood 
Division to assist domestic violence victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Van Nuys program is excellent," Papke said. "Hopefully, we'll be 
doing the same things Van Nuys is doing in the next couple of months. And we're 
hoping Van Nuys will be doing what we're doing with these kits."

WIVES CALLED UPON TO HELP THEIR HUSBANDS ON THE HUSTINGS; CAMPAIGNING: WOMEN 
ARE PLAYING KEY ROLES AS SYMBOLS OF DOMESTIC VALUES IN LOCAL RACES. SOME SAY 
THE TREND IS A REACTION AGAINST FEMINISM.

<P>
 Maybe it has to do with family values, feminism or schmaltz, but San Fernando 
Valley candidates are pressing their wives -- and in one case, a fiancee -- 
into service on the political firing line to defend and promote them as the 
Nov. 8 election nears. 
</P>
<P>
 Already Valley voters have received letters from the wives of two GOP 
candidates, one a handwritten missive from Christine Rogan, wife of the state 
assemblyman, that begins: "I have just tucked my twin girls into bed and I'm 
waiting for my husband Jim to come home from a meeting with a constituent." 
</P>
<P>
 Voters have also been informed that a third candidate, a Democrat, will be 
tying the nuptial knot Feb. 19 to the woman shown leaning lovingly on him in a 
photo in his latest campaign brochure. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's plenty of the traditional family displays that are endemic to 
campaigns. For example, the flyer from U. S. Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland 
Hills), now seeking reelection, features the virtually obligatory 
candidate-with-wife-and-family photo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But despite evidence that candidates' family members often grin and bear the 
demands of campaigning, they sometimes balk. Take the case of Greta Sybert, the 
wife of GOP congressional candidate Richard Sybert, who is challenging 
Beilenson. 
</P>
<P>
 Greta Sybert recently resisted her husband's plan to challenge Beilenson to 
join him in offering voters an open-house tour of their respective local homes, 
a stunt designed to show that Sybert has a "real" house in the district (the 
Syberts live in Calabasas), while Beilenson, the incumbent, rents an apartment 
in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still trying to convince Greta (Sybert) to let us go ahead with it," 
campaign manager James Vaughn said last week. "But she wants her home to be 
part of her private life." Greta Sybert declined to be interviewed for this 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, women have long played powerful, if varied, roles in their 
husband's political careers, from Dolley Madison to Hillary Rodham Clinton to 
Arianna Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 "Using the wife is a time-honored political technique," said Sherry Bebitch 
Jeffe, a political analyst at Claremont Graduate School. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, political observers are intrigued by the more intense political 
uses of wives and girlfriends. "It fits right in with the politics of virtue 
and family values" to use a wife as a symbol of domestic values, Jeffe 
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the subtext of this kind of campaigning is an attempt to capitalize on 
some kind of backlash against the Hillary Clinton-type political wife," 
speculated Susan Rasky, a former New York Times political reporter who now 
teaches journalism at UC Berkeley.  
</P>
<P>
 Others are less dispassionate. "This is un-feminist, Beaver Cleaver-era silly 
stuff," contended Judith Hirshberg, president of the San Fernando Valley 
chapter of the National Women's Political Caucus, reviewing some of the uses to 
which Valley wives have been put in the current political season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 'wife letter' is what I call them," said Sacramento GOP consultant Jim 
Nygren, who helped Christine Rogan, wife of state Assemblyman James Rogan 
(R-Glendale), put together the four-page handwritten letter that recently went 
to local voters with her preamble about tucking in the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "They often get the biggest response of anything I do," Nygren said of this 
political genre. Christine Rogan declined to be interviewed for this story. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor are politicians' wives or prospective wives the only family members to get 
tapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs, a Studio City resident who is single, 
dispatched a letter from his 82-year-old mother to Jewish voters calling her 
son a "mensch" (a sensible person) as part of his 1993 campaign for mayor. 
Meanwhile, Pat Maguire, an openly gay candidate in the Democratic primary for 
the 41st District state Assembly seat, tapped his mom to do a mailer for him 
last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 And when a mother is not available, there's always dad. Attorney Edward 
Tabash, who also ran in the fiercely fought 41st District Democratic primary, 
had his father send a letter to voters -- with a potholder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Edward's mother passed away in 1985, she would have loved to send you this 
potholder as a reminder to vote for our son," Abraham Tabash wrote, as he also 
outlined some of his son's policy stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Christine Rogan's letter, with a "Dear Friend" salutation, was 
targeted at about 30,000 women in the district -- both Democrats and 
Republicans, Nygren said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an attempt to give the candidate a human dimension," Nygren said of the 
Christine Rogan letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Nygren won't say it, but others contend that the letter is more specifically 
designed to mitigate Rogan's image among moderate women voters, who might be 
turned off by the candidate's ties to right-wing Christian foes of abortion. 
"It's meant to soften him up," said Steve Gray-Barkan, consultant to Adam 
Schiff, Rogan's Democratic opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nor are the wives relegated simply to gushing over their husbands or 
distributing campaign yard signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Rogan's letter, for example, seeks to deal with accusations by 
Schiff, a former federal prosecutor, that Rogan is a captive of right-wing 
Christians who want to use government to advance their agenda of banning 
abortion and teaching creationism, and that Rogan failed to live up to his 
self-made image as a tough fiscal conservative when he accepted a $20,000 pay 
hike for legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't help but laugh when Adam Schiff tries to paint Jim as some sort of 
greedy politician," Christine Rogan wrote. "Not only did Jim wash dishes to 
stay off welfare (as a teen-ager growing up in a poor family), but he took a 
50% pay cut as a corporate attorney to become a prosecutor trying gang murder 
cases" before winning a judgeship appointment and then being elected to the 
Assembly in a May, 1994, special election. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, as family values have circled the campaign -- Rogan recently told a 
debate audience that if Schiff had a family, he'd appreciate why he accepted 
the pay hike -- Schiff has played his own domestic card by introducing his 
fiancee, Eve Sanderson, to voters in his campaign literature. 
</P>
<P>
 While early Schiff literature includes a photo of the pair and identifies them 
as affianced, later renditions tell voters the actual date of the wedding. It 
looks like the Schiff campaign is fighting fire with fire, one political 
analyst speculated. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent debate, Schiff also introduced Sanderson, who had been sitting in 
the audience (actively booing Rogan at times). "We are, in fact, Adam and Eve," 
Schiff joked.  
</P>
<P>
 Nor has the involvement of the wives been confined to letter-writing. 
</P>
<P>
 GOP congressional candidate Sybert has been particularly active in involving 
his wife in his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 During a campaign year marked by controversy over illegal immigration, Sybert 
-- who supports Proposition 187, the measure to deny benefits to illegals -- 
has insisted that his views are not informed by raw nativism, that he supports 
quality legal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, he has pointed to Greta (a Brazilian native who is not yet a U. S. 
citizen) as the ideal immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
 "With her work skills and college education, she is exactly the kind of person 
we should encourage to live here," Sybert told The Times during an interview in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
 On another occasion, during a GOP primary candidate forum in Thousand Oaks, 
where the talk had turned to immigration, Sybert introduced his wife by saying, 
according to a California Journal reporter: "That's the kind of immigration 
policy we need -- where we skim off all the pretty women from these countries." 
</P>
<P>
 And while Greta Sybert does not have a U. S. passport, she has helped provide 
her husband with a passport of sorts to the congressional seat he seeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert has cited the fact that his wife graduated from Newbury Park High 
School as a sign of his ties to the 24th District -- even though he himself set 
up housekeeping in the district only a year ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Greta Sybert also has been pressed to add a human dimension to her husband and 
possibly shield him from future political attacks, according to Jeffe, the 
Claremont political analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to voters recently, Greta assured readers that her husband -- an 
avowed policy wonk -- won't forget them if he beats Beilenson and goes to 
Washington. Her husband, Greta Sybert also averred, got into politics to make 
the world a better place for their 1 1/2-year-old daughter, Stephanie, and 
other children like her. 
</P>
<P>
 Greta Sybert also warns voters against the coming attacks on her husband and 
all but asks voters to take pity on the Sybert family during these hard times. 
</P>
<P>
 "The political attacks and distortions about my husband Rich Sybert are hard 
on me. And they're hard on our daughter Stephanie, too, because children sense 
when their parents are hurt or upset," Greta Sybert wrote in her two-page 
letter to voters of Oct. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same letter, Greta Sybert also revealed to her readers that "sometimes 
my feet are so tired that Rich has to practically carry me home" after a day of 
precinct walking with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "This looks like an attempt to inoculate the candidate from future attack by 
trying to build up a bond of sympathy with the voters," Jeffe said. And it's a 
campaign ploy, she added, that's as old as the hills.

ACID SPILL FORCES EVACUATION OF 21 ON WOODMAN AVENUE IN VAN NUYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty-one people were briefly evacuated from businesses and homes along busy 
Woodman Avenue on Saturday morning after a five-gallon container of muriatic 
acid fell from the bed of a passing truck, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The chemical spill occurred about 8:45 a.m. near the intersection of Woodman 
Avenue and Branford Street.The acid, which is used to clean swimming pools, is 
harmful if swallowed or inhaled in large doses, said Los Angeles City Fire 
Department spokesman Jim Wells. 
</P>
<P>
 Four people from nearby businesses and 17 from local residences were evacuated 
while Fire Department crews closed portions of both streets to dispose of the 
acid. "They were back inside within minutes," said Los Angeles police Officer 
T. Fudala said of the evacuated people. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the truck did not stop after the spill and that the driver 
apparently did not know the container had tumbled from the bed of the vehicle.

4 DEPUTIES HURT, 3 ARRESTS MADE IN FIGHT NEAR UNIVERSAL CITYWALK; MELEE: BRAWL 
BREAKS OUT AS 500 LEAVE HALLOWEEN PARTY AT RESTAURANT. AUTHORITIES SAY IT BEGAN 
OVER PERCEIVED INSULT.

 Four Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies were slightly injured and three men 
were arrested early Saturday in connection with a fight that started as several 
hundred celebrants left a Halloween costume party at a restaurant near 
Universal CityWalk, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight, which reportedly involved three men still dressed in costume, broke 
out about 2 a.m. as more than 500 party-goers left Fung Lums restaurant at 222 
Universal Terrace Parkway, said Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Deputy Angie 
McLaughlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the fight started over a perceived insult in the parking lot 
of the restaurant. "Somebody's wife or girlfriend was slighted," said sheriff's 
Lt. Brad Welter. "But, who knows what happened? It's like a football fight. The 
guy who gets punched isn't necessarily the one who created the first foul." 
</P>
<P>
 The Halloween party was sponsored by a local production company. Between 50 
and 75 people -- many of whom apparently knew the combatants -- witnessed the 
fight, in which one man wore a skeleton costume and another was dressed in 
black. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know how bar fights go," McLaughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 One deputy was scratched on the leg, one was kicked in the mouth by a 
combatant and two others were sprayed in the face with pepper spray. All were 
treated at a nearby hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities arrested Raul M. Arevalo, 28, of Canoga Park on suspicion of 
assault with a deadly weapon; Richard W. Byrd, 23, of Granada Hills for 
allegedly disturbing the peace; and Brian J. Basowski, 20, of Canoga Park for 
suspicion of battery on a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 All three men were taken to the West Hollywood sheriff's station. Byrd was 
being held early Saturday on $259 bail and Basowski's bail was set at $500. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the suspects was cut on the head during the scuffle and all three were 
sprayed with pepper spray, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Pang, owner of Fung Lums -- which is a 10-minute walk from Universal's 
CityWalk, but not part of the complex -- said the celebrants were part of a 
sponsored party held at the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 He said there were no incidents inside the restaurant and that party-goers 
left in an orderly fashion when the business closed at 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was in costume," he said. "Everyone was leaving at the same time."

MINIMARKET CLERK FATALLY SHOOTS ALLEGED ROBBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an armed struggle taped by a convenience store video camera, a clerk shot 
and killed a would-be robber early Saturday after thinking the gunman was about 
to kill him in a back room of the business, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged robber, identified by authorities as John Ghoghas, 28, was shot 
several times in the upper torso during a robbery of the Arco minimarket at the 
corner of Magnolia Boulevard and Kester Avenue, officers said.He died on the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began about 2:45 a.m. when an unidentified woman, who police said 
was the alleged robber's accomplice, left the convenience store without paying 
for a self-serve drink. 
</P>
<P>
 The clerk, who was not identified, followed the woman to her car and collected 
the money. Moments later, Ghoghas entered the store with a .22-caliber pistol 
and demanded money, according to police accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 After collecting an unspecified amount from the register, police said, Ghoghas 
ordered the clerk into a small back office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The suspect followed the clerk into the room, and as he closed the door, 
pushed the employee backward," said Lt. Stan Embry of the LAPD's Van Nuys 
station. "The clerk thought the suspect would shoot him, so he pulled his own 
gun and they fought over the gun." 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged gunman was shot several times with a 9-millimeter pistol, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers said the woman accomplice was in custody and police Saturday were 
reviewing the convenience store video. 
</P>
<P>
 A store manager on Saturday refused to identify the clerk or comment on the 
shooting.

POST OFFICE CLOSES AMID PROTESTS FROM TOWN'S RESIDENTS; LEONA VALLEY: HAMLET 
LOSES MORE THAN A PLACE TO PICK UP MAIL AND PACKAGES AS A RESULT OF GOVERNMENT 
COST CUTTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There really isn't much to the town of Leona Valley. Now, there is even less. 
</P>
<P>
 About 12:40 p.m. Saturday, Postmaster Pat Hobart rolled down the window inside 
the post office that has served the San Gabriel Mountain hamlet for 40 years, 
and the Leona Valley Contract Post Office was no more -- no more of the fresh 
eggs she sold on the side, or the tray of free candy she proffered, or her 
friendly reminders to please pick up your mail frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 It did not go quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 residents marched in front of Country Hairizons beauty parlor, 
which fronts the building housing the post office. They lambasted U. S. Postal 
Service authorities who decided earlier this month that it wasn't economical to 
have the office open six days a week. Residents also pointed blaming fingers 
eastward -- to the encroaching suburban sprawl of Palmdale, where some may have 
to go to pick up parcels. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're slowly chopping away at the rural lifestyle," said Gail DeJongh, who 
brought some Christmas cards and postcards to be canceled with the Leona Valley 
stamp. "It's just one more chunk of Leona Valley, and they want to take it." 
</P>
<P>
 It all started when Hobart decided to retire after 32 years. The Postal 
Service requested new bids to host the office elsewhere in town, then rejected 
all of them as too expensive. Two weeks ago, they told the town the post office 
would be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 In its place, the Postal Service has erected a bank of metal boxes on the 
corner, to replace the windowed brass ones that lined the wall of the cramped 
office. And mail carriers say they will try to deliver just about anything, 
either to the boxes or to homes. Customers also can order stamps by mail. But 
residents lament inevitable trips to pick up bulky packages at the Palmdale 
post office -- a round-trip jaunt of about 30 miles for some. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But if you think a post office is just about mail, you don't know Leona 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 What town there is consists of a handful of stores scattered along the corners 
of Elizabeth Lake Road and 90th Street, in the midst of a broad grassy valley 
in the northwest corner of Los Angeles County. Everyone lives on at least 2 1/2 
acres, and most have orchards, horses or cattle. 
</P>
<P>
 If they wanted post offices where no one knows your name or cares about the 
weather, they would have moved to Palmdale, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Fears of being swallowed by Palmdale are not unfounded. One of the largest 
developments in the region is planned just between Leona Valley and Palmdale -- 
a virtual city of 7,200 homes called Ritter Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Though a relative newcomer, Carl Frahme, a 54-year-old consultant, may typify 
the fear symbolized by losing the post office. He left Valencia when new 
housing developments crept up to his lawn. He left Canyon Country almost nine 
years ago for the same reason. On Dec. 9, he will move to rural New Mexico. He 
will leave the house keys with the real estate agency when he leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be the first time the house has been locked, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We even can come in here and write a check and they know it's good," Frahme 
said as he picked up a battered package from Hobart. "They don't even ask for 
ID." 
</P>
<P>
 Hobart, 65, held up well through a morning of well-wishers wanting to mail 
just one more item. Maybe someone will save the office, she said. There is a 
town meeting Wednesday night, and a Thursday session planned with postal 
officials and Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita). For now, Hobart 
said, she will spend more time with her husband, Donald, her six children and 
her grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 "My heart is just broken," she said. "We've put in all these years and this 
has come to be. I never thought it would." 
</P>
<P>
 As the 12:30 closing time approached, Hobart leaned over to pick up a box, 
and, as if she read on it the news of someone's death, broke into sobs and 
retreated to a corner of the office. She recovered to hand the last parcel of 
mail to Lee Racket, an 80-year-old grandmother who lives next door. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's been here even longer than I have," Hobart said. 
</P>
<P>
 A half an hour later, Hobart paused before slamming the final cancellation 
stamp on a 6-by-9 envelope from Paul Clark to the Purina Pro Club in Macoutah, 
Ill., 62224. 
</P>
<P>
 All she felt, she said, was a void.

TINY, OFF-THE-WALL THEATER HANGS ON FOR 20 YEARS; LONG BEACH: ITS PLAYS, MOST 
OF THEM ORIGINAL, SATIRIZE AND PROVOKE THOUGHT ABOUT POLITICAL AND SOCIAL 
ISSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Susan Malmstrom admits that she was nervous the first time she attended a play 
at the 40-seat storefront Found Theatre, which sits between a sandwich shop and 
a bridal store on a drab, busy street in downtown Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a tiny alternative theater and you don't know what you'll get 
into," she said. "If you leave, you almost have to cross the stage and everyone 
will notice you." 
</P>
<P>
 But her reticence quickly vanished. Malmstrom loved the production, "Bus Trip 
to Vegas," in which a group of bizarre characters journey to the gambling mecca 
for a few hours to try to strike it rich. Among the passengers were a 
mother-daughter country duo dubbed The Juggs, a beauty queen and a Barbie doll 
clone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was absolutely hysterical," said Malmstrom, who reviews applications for 
arts grants for the Public Corp. for the Arts in Long Beach. "It made fun of 
our materialistic culture." 
</P>
<P>
 The production was typical of the wacky, off-the-wall plays that the theater 
has presented for 20 years. The plays, most of them original, satirize and 
provoke thought about political and social issues of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Found is unabashed about being a "message" house, touching on themes 
ranging from hucksterism and corporate greed to spousal abuse and AIDS. But 
it's hardly preaching. Instead, audiences laugh their way to enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Found has lampooned the shoe fetish of former Philippines First Lady 
Imelda Marcos, even covering the theater walls with shoes for the play. It has 
poked fun at coupon-clipping, coffee-drinking, soap opera-watching housewives, 
and parodied telethons and America's obsession with fast food. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun, fresh, low-cost experimental theater that's not excruciating to sit 
through," Malmstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Found, performers rarely sit. They walk, march, roll, stand on chairs, 
do reverse somersaults, and jump in and out of barrels as they mine a rich vein 
of vigorous, physical theater. The actors usually play multiple roles requiring 
quick costume changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience might see high drama one moment and something resembling an 
irreverent "Saturday Night Live" skit the next. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're either subtle or right out there, in your face," said Joyce Hackett, a 
Found actress who first came to the theater 18 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In the competitive and fragile world of live theater, where even major 
companies can falter, the Found has endured on a shoestring budget and modest 
ticket prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers attribute the theater's success to the tenacity of the two women who 
lead it: Cynthia Galles, 42, who started the Found in 1974, and literary 
director Virginia DeMoss, 46, who signed on a year later. Galles and DeMoss 
"keep it going," said Dorothea MacNeil, who has been attending Found plays 
almost since the theater opened. 
</P>
<P>
 But Galles insists that a core group of devoted "foundlings," as company 
members are called, deserve the credit. They perform without pay, rehearsing 
three hours a night, five nights a week for several weeks before a play opens. 
They paint walls, make costumes and handle lighting and sound. When the theater 
was created, they built the stage and even searched for used theater seats.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were fortunate to have wonderful, generous, talented people willing to do 
everything," Galles said. "People care about this theater." 
</P>
<P>
 The reliance on volunteers allows the Found to stage five plays a year on a 
$15,000 budget earmarked mostly for rent and utilities. The Found's choice of 
material has also permitted it to exist on a pittance. Original plays and 
public domain classics such as Shakespeare don't require royalties. 
</P>
<P>
 The box office, which charges $10 admission for most plays, covers a large 
chunk of the costs. The theater also conducts fund-raisers and receives 
donations and grants. During the last two years, the Public Corp. for the Arts 
has given the Found a total of $6,875, according to Malmstrom. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater has no advertising budget, relying on word of mouth and press 
releases of upcoming performances to draw audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Galles acknowledges that it has been a struggle to keep the Found afloat over 
the years. "We've never been off the edge," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater closed for a few months at one point to search for a new location 
after the rent was increased. And at some plays, the actors have outnumbered 
the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 MacNeil recalls one night when she was the only one in the audience. "I said, 
'Cynthia, you don't have to put the play on,' " MacNeil recalled. "And she 
said, 'We play even if we have only one person.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Marking its 20th anniversary, the theater is staging "Hot Flash Backs," a 
collection of scenes from more than 20 plays that have been performed at the 
Found since it opened its doors. In the show, which wraps up at 8:30 p.m. 
Friday and Saturday, Galles, DeMoss and Hackett juggle 40 different roles with 
speedy costume changes and quick changes of character and mood. 
</P>
<P>
 The show features another Found trademark: a combination of live performances 
and video scenes projected on a wall behind the stage. In some instances, plays 
incorporate video and live action at the same time, with actors on the video 
exchanging lines with performers on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80% of the Found's plays are original. Even when established works are 
produced, they're adapted to such an extent that even their authors might have 
trouble recognizing them. In "Cinderella," for example, the health-conscious 
heroine persuaded the prince to finance her health food restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, the entire theater becomes a part of the play. For the three-part 
"Beyond the Valley of the Flight Attendants," in which the high-altitude 
servers took revenge on surly passengers by murdering them, the theater was 
transformed into an airplane. Members of the audience became passengers, with 
the attendants serving them refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
 On occasion, audience participation has gotten out of hand. During one 
performance of the housewife epic "Broads," a man in the audience walked on the 
stage, took an ashtray from a table, walked back to his seat and lit a 
cigarette. One of the actors casually sauntered over and retrieved it as if 
that were part of the action. 
</P>
<P>
 Galles launched the theater at the suggestion of a college professor at UC 
Irvine. "Cynthia was a student of mine," said the professor, Ashley Carr, who 
now teaches theater arts at Cal State Long Beach. "We were doing experimental 
pieces. I told her to set up her own theater." 
</P>
<P>
 Galles and other UC Irvine theater arts graduates staged the first play in a 
church. They gave the theater its current name after they "found" their own 
space, a former Laundromat at 7th Street and Orange Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 After the rent was raised a few years later, they moved the theater to its 
current site, a former printing shop, at 251 E. 7th St., just west of Long 
Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 While many "foundlings" have been trained actors, others have gotten involved 
after seeing a few shows. 
</P>
<P>
 DeMoss started out attending Found plays. Her knowledge of theater was limited 
to studying classic plays as an English major in college, but in a few months, 
she found herself working backstage, then performing. She wrote her first Found 
play, a long monologue about a woman in a retirement home looking forward to a 
Liberace concert. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was exciting to see what I'd written (being performed) on stage," DeMoss 
said. The Found quickly "became a large part of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 DeMoss and others are quick to point out, however, that the theater is not a 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have your day job to do your acting," said Hackett, a hospital 
admissions officer who has acted at community colleges, sung with a jazz 
ensemble and is a member of Bard in the Yard, which performs summer Shakespeare 
on the Queen Mary. 
</P>
<P>
 DeMoss is a free-lance editor and writer for trade publications. 
</P>
<P>
 Galles works as a graphic artist and has some financial independence through 
her family, thus allowing her to focus on the Found. 
</P>
<P>
 She writes the bulk of the plays, although they are polished during rehearsal, 
with performers contributing dialogue and ideas for stage action. Galles also 
directs the productions and often performs. 
</P>
<P>
 While Galles would like the Found to play to full houses all the time and 
enjoy more financial security, she said moving to a larger facility would 
inhibit what the foundlings do best. "The kind of work we do is geared for a 
facility that's small," she said. "The intensity of the experience we give 
people would go down." 
</P>
<P>
 Other storefront theaters have operated in Long Beach, but the Found is the 
sole survivor, observers say. The Out Theatre, dedicated to plays with gay and 
lesbian themes, is gone. The Uprising, a coffeehouse theater, closed. 
</P>
<P>
 John Traub, the Out's founder, said he closed its in 1991 after five years 
because he "ran out of energy." The Uprising, which staged 13 original plays a 
year, operated from 1986-88 before closing because of financial difficulties, 
according to Carr, its co-director. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Carr and Traub praise the Found's productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Traub said the theater's work is "very intelligent, entertainment that is 
thought provoking." 
</P>
<P>
 Carr said the plays are "fun and dynamic. . . . There's an audience for them 
or they wouldn't have survived for 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 But observers say that without the perseverance and dedication of Galles and 
DeMoss, the Found would have met the same fate as the other storefront theaters 
that folded. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the Found were to vanish, so would a key outlet for original plays, 
they add. 
</P>
<P>
 "Larger theaters are not able to do this kind of original work," said Nanci 
Andersen, who has been with the Found for nine years as an actress and lighting 
technician. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Malmstrom: "They're the only smaller organization performing the kind of 
original material they come up with. There's no more theater like (the Found) 
in Long Beach."

THE LONG ROAD HOME; CONSTRUCTION: FEWER THAN A DOZEN OF THE 321 HOUSES 
DESTROYED BY THE LAGUNA BEACH-EMERALD BAY FIRE HAVE BEEN REBUILT. AN EXPERT IN 
THE FIELD IS NOT SURPRISED BY THE PACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Custom home builder Robert Carey said he became concerned after several 
neighbors who lost homes to last October's devastating brush fire pledged to be 
back in their homes within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey, who has been building homes in Laguna Beach for 25 years, suspected 
that most fire victims were underestimating the incredibly time-consuming 
process needed to design, permit and build a replacement home. So he devised a 
timeline for a typical 2,000-square-foot home sitting on a lot with no known 
geological faults -- the best rebuilding circumstances for which an owner could 
hope. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: Construction alone would eat up eight or more months. Planning and 
permitting could take longer than six months if projects were subjected to 
Laguna Beach's design and review process, which requires a full examination by 
the city Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Building plans that don't dramatically expand a home's size or affect a 
neighbor's view can be cleared by the planning department staff. If size and 
height restrictions are met, the review process could consist of just one 
public meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to show them that, in most cases, if they started (to build) that 
very day, the earliest they could move in would be January (1995)," Carey said. 
"For a lot of them, it was going to mean a whole year before they even broke 
ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Carey was right. 
</P>
<P>
 A year after the fire, fewer than a dozen of the 321 homes destroyed in Laguna 
Beach and the neighboring Emerald Bay development have been rebuilt. Perhaps 30 
additional homes will be completed, Carey estimated, before the vast majority 
of fire victims even enter the municipal permitting process. But the city has 
stuck to its promise to speed up the time it takes to get permits, in part by 
hiring a San Diego-based company to help review designs. 
</P>
<P>
 Public attention rightfully has focused on those who lost homes. But the fire 
also created a window of opportunity for builders, designers, architects and 
engineers who are helping rebuild the destroyed neighborhood atop Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the fire, residents said, the area was overrun by 
out-of-area builders who were trying to snare reconstruction contracts. But 
local contractors and architects, who depend upon hard-won reputations for 
their jobs, tended to take a low-key approach to winning jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get most of your work by word-of-mouth, you want to make sure that 
the job you do is a good one," Carey said. "That means finding skilled 
tradesmen, making sure that geological surveys and (designs) are adequate." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, there has been no dramatic shortage of laborers or materials, 
according to contractors and architects. But that situation could change as 
hundreds of homeowners begin to rebuild during the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey was not trying to discourage fire victims when he unveiled his 
pessimistic timeline. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the 45-year-old Laguna Beach resident shared in the anguish when the 
Oct. 27 wildfire roared through town. He battled flames, strong winds and 
flagging water pressure throughout that night, saving his custom home from 
flames that singed nearby trees. He agonized with two relatives and several 
good friends who lost homes nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an emotional fight, just getting money from the insurance company," said 
Carey, who is rebuilding 12 homes for fire victims. "And at the same time, 
these people are supposed to be counting how many salt and pepper shakers they 
used to have, they're trying to gather up a (home) design team." 
</P>
<P>
 (So far, insurance companies have made at least partial settlements on 2,600 
fire-related claims and have agreed to make payments of $350 million.) 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the fire victims who have rebuilt within 12 months of the fire trimmed 
design and construction time by adhering to relatively simple plans that 
avoided the time-consuming design and review process or by reusing parts of 
their old foundations.  
</P>
<P>
 But most homeowners were unable to save their foundations -- and others were 
forced to pour tons of concrete to anchor new foundations to bedrock. Carey, 
for example, is building two homes that are anchored by a total of 52 caissons 
-- or 100 cubic yards of concrete. Carey has built a few custom homes in Orange 
County each year since the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 One measure of Laguna Beach's revival is the slow-but-sure process of 
restoring electrical power to the devastated lots. Within days of the fire, 
Southern California Edison restored power to 23,000 customers who lost service 
when power poles and lines burned down, said Steven Nelson, Edison's area 
manager for Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 By the middle of this month, Edison had restored full service to six rebuilt 
homes. It also installed temporary poles to provide power to construction crews 
on 87 lots. Electric utilities won't restore full service "until after 
homeowners get a final inspection from the city or county saying that it's OK 
to energize it," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen homeowners, deciding to forgo rebuilding, have put their 
fire-scarred lots in Laguna Beach up for sale. And potential buyers are 
starting to surface. 
</P>
<P>
 "One lot, which was listed at $205,000, is in escrow," said Lee Schapel, a 
real estate agent with Coldwell Banker in Laguna Hills. "And I hope to close on 
one soon that should sell for about $210,000." Schapel said that land and home 
prices are lower than in recent years, as is the case in all of Southern 
California, but that the total number of home sales seems to be rising. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners are asking $200,000 and more for lots that can accommodate 
2,500-square-foot homes, though prices increase noticeably for larger lots with 
better ocean views. And the cost of new homes being constructed varies 
dramatically: Some are reportedly being built for $200,000 or less while others 
cost upward of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 And, the number of lots for sale will likely increase as weary homeowners 
decide not to rebuild. "I've talked to quite a few owners who want to sell but 
whose lots aren't on the market yet," Schapel said. "I'm advising them to hold 
onto them, if possible, for a few years. As more come on the market, the prices 
will be driven down." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire victims have good reason to walk away; many say they have been pulled in 
many different directions since the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the fire, Red Cross volunteers were demanding information to 
gauge the extent of relief efforts. Similarly, Federal Emergency Management 
Agency officials were adamant that victims complete disaster forms, and 
insurance companies were urging them to begin the mind-numbing task of 
compiling an inventory of their losses. After newspapers published names and 
addresses of those who lost homes, homeowners were deluged with sales calls 
from potential builders and subcontractors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of putting their lives back together, homeowners who chose to 
rebuild also were fielding questions from architects, interior designers and 
building contractors. The pressure, professionals say, is sometimes too 
difficult for homeowners to bear. 
</P>
<P>
 "The design process is really something that people should enjoy," said 
architect Brion Jeannette. "They really should have the time to fall in love 
with (the idea of a new home.) It's a shame that it's part of a process that's 
so emotionally taxing." 
</P>
<P>
 Even absent a devastating fire, building a home can be an emotional 
experience. "As joyful as it can be, there are times in the process that are 
very stressful," said Laguna Beach architect Daniel Martinez, who is designing 
seven fire replacement homes. "I see myself as more of an educator, helping 
them understand what is possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Architects report that some homeowners -- including several longtime residents 
-- are content with designs that stick close in spirit and character to the 
homes they lost.  
</P>
<P>
 But others "have been able to view this as an opportunity to project something 
new," said Laguna Beach architect Horst Noppenberger, who is designing five 
homes, including one on Pacific Avenue that recently won a local design 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
 The award-winning house taking shape at Pacific Avenue and Skyline Drive will 
have a roof that appears to float above glass walls. The design incorporates 
"the clear feeling of upward force created by the profile of the surrounding 
hills," Noppenberger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug and Rebecca Wood owe their showcase home -- the only fire home to win 
such an award -- to a bit of serendipity. Doug Wood, 37, stumbled upon 
Noppenberger's Forest Avenue office just days after the fire as his wife 
shopped for new clothing at the nearby Laura Downing shop. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woods were adamant that their home be rebuilt quickly, so Noppenberger 
advised them to stick with a design that wouldn't be subject to much City Hall 
scrutiny. The Woods agreed to meet height and size restrictions -- thereby 
escaping the lengthy review process -- and, by February, they had agreed upon 
the final design. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, along with 6-week-old son Trevor, now hope to move into their new 
home in early May. 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, builder Carl Akins, whose own Emerald Bay home suffered $60,000 
in damage during the fire, said many homeowners who opted to stay in Laguna 
Beach were overly optimistic about the time it would take to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 Akins saved his house from almost certain destruction when he circumvented 
police barricades on the day of the fire by boarding a boat in Newport Harbor 
and then swimming ashore near his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Akins used a garden hose to hold back the flames that devoured three nearby 
houses. The fire that destroyed Akins' landscaped yard and outdoor furniture 
also destroyed part of the home's roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Homes in the exclusive neighborhood of Emerald Bay range in price from 
$600,000 to $2 million, while replacement costs for a custom home range from 
$125 to $200 per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Akins, who's been building custom homes for 20 years, quickly repaired the 
relatively minor damage to his own home. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has a slower-than-anticipated process for eight other homes that his 
company is rebuilding in Emerald Bay. Seven homes are under construction and 
work on another is about to begin. Construction on three homes in Laguna Beach 
that Akins' company is rebuilding is also about to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 "A year ago I thought we'd be under construction within six months," Akins 
said, "but in fact, it took 10 or 11 months." 
</P>
<P>
 Akins blames three bottlenecks for slowing reconstruction in Emerald Bay: 
Customers have invariably taken longer than anticipated to settle with 
insurance companies. Orange County, which has jurisdiction over Monarch Bay, 
has been slow to issue grading permits. And, Akins acknowledged that he may 
have been overly optimistic about the ability of fire victims to start the 
arduous process of rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine if you went home and found your house burned to the ground, and you 
have to remember every single thing you had in the house for the insurance 
company," Akins said. "It's not easy, because everyone's been traumatized. 
There's a lot more to rebuilding their lives . . . than just a house." 
</P>
<P>
 The past year also has been difficult for residents in those neighborhoods who 
didn't lose homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all been very emotional," Akins said. "First you lived without neighbors 
for 10 months and now you have the noise, noise, noise from the big 
construction equipment. It's been tough. But it's now a year later and we're 
coming back."

JAMES FLANIGAN: KEEP IMMIGRATION ON THE SIDE OF COMMON SENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you stick to the facts and use common sense about immigration, answers come 
clear and readily. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, partly, is timing, not numbers. The number of illegal immigrants 
-- roughly 300,000 a year, half of them to California -- is no greater now than 
in the 1970s and 1980s. But back then the economy was booming and California 
politicians, from President Ronald Reagan to Sen. Pete Wilson, supported an 
unhindered flow of illegal immigrants to work in agriculture and industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But the economy is not booming today. Therefore, moves to stop illegal 
immigration are necessary and urgent. That's why the recent recommendations of 
the federal Commission on Immigration Reform are so important, and why 
Proposition 187 is such a dangerous distraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to an unprecedented determination to curb illegal immigration, the U.S. 
Border Patrol has been beefed up at El Paso and San Diego. And in response to a 
Reform Commission recommendation, a computerized registry to validate 
employment documents will soon start pilot programs in five states. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission, which was set up by the Immigration Act of 1990, also 
recommended a cutoff of public benefits, such as welfare, to illegal 
immigrants, but made an exception for education and child nutrition programs. 
</P>
<P>
 That contrasts directly with Proposition 187, which targets children by 
prohibiting education and non-emergency medical care for illegal immigrants. 
The initiative on the Nov. 8 ballot is an angry measure, designed to send a 
message of public ire to Washington, which collects federal income taxes from 
illegal immigrants but lets state and local governments in California pay for 
their social services. Gov. Wilson's office is seeking $2.4 billion in 
reimbursement from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's frustration is understandable, but Proposition 187 is the wrong 
way to go. If it passes, Washington won't pay California any money. But the 
state could lose billions in federal funds and be forced to spend hundreds of 
millions to find, expel and, presumably, deport immigrant students and then to 
fight countless lawsuits -- including a big one with the federal government 
because 187, targeting "suspected illegals" on what amounts to racial and 
ethnic grounds, is almost certainly unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the initiative is only to send a message, it's one expensive telegram. 
</P>
<P>
 The right way to go about it would be to keep pressure on Washington to send 
back tax money to offset California's extraordinary immigration burden and then 
to press enforcement efforts to tighten borders and deport illegal immigrants 
already here. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis at all times should be on enforcing the law, because not to do so 
is an injustice to America's legal immigrants, now numbering 750,000 a year 
plus about 120,000 legal refugees. Not enforcing the law also endangers all 
immigration, an integral part of the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a backlash against immigration is now growing nationwide, though not 
to the angry pitch of former times when America excluded Chinese immigrants in 
the 19th Century, virtually stopped immigration from southern and eastern 
Europe in the 1920s and deported Mexican laborers in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before things get out of hand, we'll see changes in the next few years to make 
immigration policy flexible, allowing more immigrants in good economic years 
and fewer in bad years, says Lawrence Fuchs of Brandeis University, vice 
chairman of today's Immigration Reform Commission and head of the 1979 
commission that outlined policies for the immigration acts of 1980, 1986 and 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration has evolved over time -- and has included a certain amount of 
illegal entry ever since the 1920s, when the first laws controlling immigration 
were passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans never welcomed immigrants when they arrived, although we always 
admire groups that came in years past. "At any time, only 8% of Americans said 
they would favor more immigration," says Rita Simon, a dean at Washington's 
American University and author of "The Ambivalent Welcome, Public Policy and 
Immigration." 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration's high point, before the present, was the decade 1901-10, when 
880,000 people a year came in -- in reality more than that, because only 
steerage passengers were counted, not cabin class. 
</P>
<P>
 But immigration slowed in the 1920s and reversed in the 1930s, with as many 
emigrating from the United States as immigrating to it. A big change came in 
1965, notes Dennis Aigner, dean of UC Irvine's graduate school of management, 
when U.S. policy shifted to admit people fairly from all countries and to allow 
family reunification as a major reason for admittance. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect was profound. Numbers increased from an average 250,000 immigrants 
a year in the 1950s to 500,000 annually in the 1970s and 700,000-plus in the 
1980s. The new people came from Asia and Africa, Latin America and Southern and 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 And increasingly they came to California. Since 1970, the state's foreign-born 
population has climbed from 1.7 million to 6.5 million, according to Kevin 
McCarthy of Rand Corp., the Santa Monica research firm, which is launching a 
15-month study of California immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 The immigrants weren't only hungry masses. Asian entrepreneurs came, set up 
businesses and brought their families. Nurses and doctors came from many lands, 
as well as graduate students in computer science and engineering who stayed to 
staff the frontier companies of Silicon Valley. We have always had a tier of 
high-end immigrants, from Revolutionary War generals like Von Steuben and 
Kosciuszko to refugee scientists like Einstein. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the last two decades we also had an influx of poorer, less educated 
people from Mexico and Latin America, Asia and Africa, just as from the 
earliest days we have received unlettered peasants from Ireland and Germany, 
Poland and Italy -- and involuntary arrivals from Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 But they too have always found work or made their own, whether as servant 
girls -- or nannies for children of middle-class Americans -- or truck-loading 
laborers or farmers or cobblers, or tailors, taxi drivers or gas station 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, no immigrant influx has been without conflict, from the coal mines 
of Pennsylvania to the lettuce fields of California. "But over time, these are 
self-selective people who bring energy to our economy, especially as we favor 
family immigration and so provide an infrastructure," says Fuchs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The main benefit America has always offered immigrants is not a soft life for 
themselves but the promise of a better life for their children. That has kept 
our economy young and vital -- an important consideration for a population that 
needs taxpaying workers to fund Social Security in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 Outsiders often see such historic patterns more clearly than we do. Norbert 
Walter, chief economist of Germany's Deutsche Bank, puts it this way: "Because 
you have selective immigration, I am really optimistic about America at the end 
of this decade, when the United States will be the youngest nation among the 
industrial countries." 
</P>
<P>
 If you use common sense about immigration, the outlook is clear and hopeful.

DISNEY'S MAGIC SCHOOL; CALARTS STUDENTS ARE AT THE CORE OF THE ANIMATION BOOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It may be the best investment Walt Disney ever made. 
</P>
<P>
 Not the mouse who grew to become an American cultural icon, nor the soggy 
Florida swampland that cost Disney about $185 an acre in 1964 and is now worth 
more than $1 billion as the home of Walt Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's masterstroke may have been his founding of a private arts college 
that squats in relative obscurity among the brown, dusty hills of Valencia 
about 50 miles north of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Conceived three decades ago, partly as a clever way to funnel an army of 
skilled animators into the Disney studios, California Institute of the Arts has 
spawned a generation of students who have become the creative nucleus of the 
Disney empire -- responsible for animating the long-locked princesses, chubby 
lion cubs and other characters that have brought the company billions of 
dollars in entertainment and related merchandise revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 If there's one elusive ingredient vital to the incandescent Disney magic, 
CalArts is it. 
</P>
<P>
 As Walt Disney Co. continues to dominate the animated film business with hits 
such as "The Lion King" and "Aladdin," CalArts alumni continue to dominate its 
animation ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 CalArts graduates contributed to "The Lion King," which has 
grossed $267 million domestically so far. The co-producer and co-director of 
1992's "Aladdin" came from CalArts, as did more than 50 other animators on the 
film.  
</P>
<P>
 More CalArts grads were behind the 1993 movie "The Nightmare Before 
Christmas," including producer Tim Burton and director Henry Selick. Nearly 70 
CalArts alumni worked on "Beauty and the Beast." More are now at work on 
"Pocahontas," "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" and "Fantasia Continued." 
</P>
<P>
 These feature films have helped ignite an industrywide boom in animation and 
become Disney's financial core. While attendance at the firm's theme parks lags 
-- the Euro Disney investment is undergoing a massive refinancing effort amid 
losses of more than $550 million -- and its live-action record is mixed, 
animated movies and ancillary products have driven revenue to record levels of 
$7.36 billion for the first nine months of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, the year of "The Little Mermaid," Disney's filmed entertainment 
revenue has swelled from $1.59 billion to $3.67 billion in 1993, and product 
sales have more than tripled, from $411 million to $1.42 billion. Today, 
"animated products affect about 30% of Disney's (annual) cash flow," says 
Harold Vogel, an entertainment analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly how big a contribution CalArts makes to Disney's bottom line is nearly 
impossible to measure, and both Walt Disney Co. and the school like to play 
down their interdependence. Disney executives point out that they also recruit 
from Sheridan College in Toronto and Ringling Brothers School of Art in 
Sarasota, Fla., among others. 
</P>
<P>
 CalArts emphasizes that many of its graduates migrate elsewhere for work and 
that animation artists represent only about a fifth of the school, which is 
also highly regarded for its programs in live-action filmmaking, fine art, 
music, dance and theater.  
</P>
<P>
 But both CalArts and Disney acknowledge that the longtime bond between them 
has grown into a powerful synergy that keeps Disney well at the forefront of 
the animation business -- and brings CalArts money, cachet and connections. 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Disney Co. Vice Chairman Roy E. Disney, whose father, Roy O. Disney, took 
over CalArts' construction upon younger brother Walt's death in 1966, says 
CalArts has had a "huge amount" to do with the studio's ability to produce one 
highly profitable film after another.  
</P>
<P>
 CalArts students "have such good groundwork that they can start out at a much 
higher level in the art than someone coming in from the outside," says Disney, 
who along with recently deposed Walt Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg 
and Animated Features President Peter Schneider, is credited with the revival 
of animation at Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 CalArts opened its animation department in 1972 and graduated its first 
animation class in 1976. But the dynamic partnership didn't fully gel until the 
mid-1980s, when CalArts hit its stride academically and Disney emerged from a 
long companywide downturn that had depressed earnings and resulted in a series 
of dismally performing animated films such as "The Black Cauldron." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Disney leaned on the school simply to provide warm bodies. Roy E. 
Disney says that when he rejoined the company during a dramatic management coup 
in 1984, "there was a bit of an exodus" in the animation department. "We had to 
go to CalArts and say, 'Who wants to come and work?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The beginning of the resurgence was "The Little Mermaid" in 1989, which 
critics said recaptured the Disney magic and which drew millions of moviegoers. 
 
</P>
<P>
 But Disney's tradition of investing in and nurturing animation artists -- and 
keeping them in the fold -- is as old as its treasured mouse. In the 1930s, 
when Walt Disney started art classes at his studio, a visitor was likely to 
encounter 30 men in tailored suits gathered around a sandbox, sketching the 
movements of a live deer in preparation for "Bambi." 
</P>
<P>
 "CalArts started with Walt's having housed a great group of talented artists 
under one roof, and seeing them rubbing off on one another and the synergies 
that happened when they got together. And so his notion for the school was to 
do the same thing as a school instead of as a business," Roy Disney says. "For 
sure, he saw it (CalArts) right from the beginning as a wellspring of finding 
talent." 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty-odd years later, the school sends forth a steady stream of new talent 
that receives in-house classes and training programs at the studio.  
</P>
<P>
 "School just goes on here after they leave there," Disney says. "We think it's 
probably the single most important thing we do." 
</P>
<P>
 That commitment translates into generous support of CalArts. Roy Disney sits 
on the school's board of trustees. So does Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael D. 
Eisner. So does Katzenberg, who helped drive Disney's vigorous comeback in 
animation before he left the company in August. 
</P>
<P>
 When Disney hosts an animated movie premiere, the proceeds usually go to 
CalArts. Following a benefit screening of "The Lion King" in June, for example, 
Roy Disney wrote a check to the school for $800,000. When CalArts President 
Steven D. Lavine decided in 1988 that it was important to equip the animation 
department with computers, the Roy Disney Family Foundation and Walt Disney Co. 
put up the money for a three-year plan.  
</P>
<P>
 In financial terms, Disney's investment in the school represents only a 
smidgen of the company's annual revenue, and Lavine says Disney's total 
contribution represents only about 5% of the school's annual budget. But Disney 
aids the college in other, vital ways. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, when the Northridge earthquake caused $30 million in damage to 
the campus in January, Eisner directed the real estate team at Disney to find a 
temporary site for the school. And "it was Frank Wells (the late chief 
operating officer of Disney) who approached the Bank of America for us and 
helped arrange the financing to get us through it," Lavine says.  
</P>
<P>
 Lavine also turned to his board of trustees to write letters urging the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency to grant money to the school, which 
received more than $22 million in federal aid. The school's A-list board 
includes Creative Artists Agency Chairman Michael S. Ovitz; QVC Chairman and 
Chief Executive Barry Diller; Bruce Berman, Warner Bros. Pictures president of 
worldwide production and a former student at CalArts; L.A. Music Center board 
Chairman Robert B. Egelston, and computer software guru Peter Norton. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to be sure that the people at FEMA understood that there is a 
powerful synergy, and that since in the economy of California the strongest 
element is the entertainment industry, that there is good reason to be 
concerned with the well-being of an institution that feeds the health of that 
industry," Lavine says. 
</P>
<P>
 CalArts' ability to feed Hollywood's health derives from a curriculum that is 
extraordinarily industry-oriented for a fine arts school. Classes emphasize 
what is new and how the arts will define the next generation of entertainment.  
</P>
<P>
 Hartmut Bitomsky, dean of the School of Film/Video, says that "especially the 
character animation students . . . are very industry-driven," inviting 
comparisons between the CalArts-Disney link and traditional 
corporate-university relationships such as that between Eastman Kodak Co. and 
Rochester University or the aerospace industry and California Institute of 
Technology in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Disney is the school's only Hollywood supporter. Lavine says Ovitz 
has been a key help in CalArts' recent move into multimedia. 
</P>
<P>
 "His agents have been exploring which of the new technologies they think are 
going to be the most valuable for their clients to get involved in. . . ." 
Lavine says. "We've been getting advice from that group of agents about those 
new technologies." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A steady influx of Disney-loving students is only one resource CalArts 
provides its corporate founder. The obsessive control Disney exercises 
throughout the Magic Kingdom extends into animation largely through CalArts, 
creating what critics call the "Disney-CalArts look" in its films.  
</P>
<P>
 "Disney has found a formula and it's working for them," says Becky Bristow, 
CalArts' director of character animation. "They are always within their 
corporate icon." 
</P>
<P>
 That predictability has been a key element of Disney's success, driving 
everything from film attendance to patronage of live attractions such as "The 
Lion King Celebration" parade at Disneyland to sales of millions of pajamas, 
CDs, videos, pop-up books, Halloween costumes and other merchandising spinoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Characters with the so-called Disney look crop up often in the work of 
students at CalArts, where seven of the 20 teachers in the character animation 
department are employed by Disney. Mark Kausler, a CalArts graduate and veteran 
Disney animator, says the trademark Disney design "pervades every aspect" of 
its films, from the story line to the character types to the colors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't say they teach Disney style there (at CalArts) per se," Kausler 
says, "but they teach Disney building blocks." Beyond that, he says, "it comes 
out by imitation." 
</P>
<P>
 Animators point out the similarities in the latest generation of Disney 
characters: Pocahontas looks like the Native American cousin of the "Aladdin" 
princess, who in turn looks like the Arab reincarnation of Belle in "Beauty and 
the Beast." The evil Scar in "The Lion King" and the villainous Jafar in 
"Aladdin" could be relatives. Even the large-beaked Zazu in "The Lion King" 
resembles Jafar's parrot sidekick, Iago. 
</P>
<P>
 One obvious hallmark of Disney design is characters with huge, expressive 
eyes. "Disney has a fixation on the eyes, because they feel that the story is 
told through the eyes," Kausler says. Other Disney perennials are a lovable 
lead character, goofy sidekicks that provide the gags and a moralistic tale 
with an upbeat ending.  
</P>
<P>
 CalArts' Lavine insists that the studio maintains a hands-off approach to the 
school's curriculum. Indeed, much of the impetus to create Disney-esque 
animation seems to come from students who view the school as a ticket to a job 
at the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are guys (at CalArts) who have big Disney stars in their eyes, and 
that's where they want to be. That's where they want to go," says one recent 
graduate who declined to be named, out of fear of being blacklisted by Disney. 
"People sometimes do a Disney-looking film because they want to work for Disney 
rather than take risks artistically," he says, adding, "Everyone in my class 
that wanted to go to Disney went to Disney." 
</P>
<P>
 "Disney has made the most profound investment in carrying animation . . . to 
the highest level, pushing the field more, so clearly they attract a lot of our 
best students," Lavine says. 
</P>
<P>
 The studio's lure is powerful, despite a strict hierarchy and rigid rules that 
have led some young critics to label it Mouseschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
 That analogy also extends to Disney's tight grip on its animators, most of 
whom sign three- to five-year contracts. Rival companies hoping to acquire a 
piece of the lucrative animation market accuse Disney of monopolizing talent. 
Sources at Warner Bros., Turner Pictures and Steven Spielberg's Amblin 
Entertainment -- which will be merged into the new studio being formed by 
Spielberg, Katzenberg and record mogul David Geffen -- say Disney has 
unofficially posted a "no poaching" warning to the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The implied meaning, they say, is that competitors who don't want to sully 
their relations with Disney would be wise to keep their hands off contracted 
Disney animators. Roy Disney says he is "not aware of anything like that," 
adding that if there is such a practice at Disney, "I don't want to know about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney often scoops up fledgling animators halfway through their schooling, 
taking advantage of their eagerness to make money after spending $14,600 a year 
in tuition.  
</P>
<P>
 Animators' salaries have soared as the business has gained momentum in the 
past few years. The Cartoonists Union minimum for beginners in theatrical 
animation is $800 a week, and higher-level positions command an average of 
$1,500 to $2,000 a week, topping out at $5,000 or so a week for the industry's 
handful of superstars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students are much more job-conscious now than when I was at CalArts. . . . 
The films are so successful now, there's a desire to be part of it, like being 
part of a winning football team," says Larry White, who graduated in 1979 and 
is currently animating a pug dog character for "Pocahontas." 
</P>
<P>
 White, who has worked for Disney on and off for 15 years, says he was referred 
to CalArts when he applied for a job at Disney in 1976. White earned a 
Disney-sponsored scholarship to help pay for much of his schooling, and he now 
teaches beginning animation classes at CalArts two nights a week. 
</P>
<P>
 White is one of the more than 600 animation artists moving in November into 
new animation headquarters on Disney's Burbank lot, a move symbolic of the 
division's growth both in size and importance to the company. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Disney's resurrection of the art has more young people 
wanting to animate: CalArts' Bitomsky says the number of animation applicants 
has grown 60% in the last several years, to 480 in the current school year. The 
school accepted 88. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that competitors are starting to lure CalArts graduates hasn't 
dampened the Disney hubris:  
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe there are kids who would prefer to work somewhere else for a while. And 
I think probably that it's good for them," Roy Disney says. "Because you find 
that if you do get out there to most places that do animation, and then you 
come in here and realize what an enormously high standard we have, it's a whole 
new challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say Disney's animated film revenue has grown so high, it will 
inevitably flatten over the next few years, no matter what the level of CalArts 
input. Vogel projects that Disney's filmed entertainment revenue for 1995 will 
leap beyond this year's estimated $3.7 billion and that filmed entertainment 
earnings for 1995 will pass the $1-billion mark, due largely to "The Lion 
King." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, at this stage of the game, it gets tougher. 'The Lion King' was 
extraordinary in its success," Vogel says. "There has to be a ceiling 
somewhere." The Return of Animation 
</P>
<P>
 While the contribution by theme parks to Walt Disney Co.'s bottom line has 
steadily waned, from a 64% share of the company's $1.23 billion in earnings 
five years ago to 35% today, filmed-entertainment accounted for 21% of profit; 
for the nine months ended June 30, it made up 44% of the $1.53 billion in 
earnings. 
</P>

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: YOUR MONEY; EMPLOY DOMESTICS? THIS TAX 
CHANGE HITS HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kathy Kristof 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The estimated 2 million Americans who owe so-called "nanny taxes" for 
household workers are in for a pleasant surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress recently passed a bill that significantly simplifies the rules 
regarding paying and filing tax returns for household employees. President 
Clinton signed the bill into law on Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The revisions, which aim to increase compliance with the nation's domestic 
employee tax laws, were spurred by the "Nannygate" scandal last year, in which 
President Clinton's first nominee for attorney general, Zoe Baird, and a later 
candidate, federal Judge Kimba M. Wood, withdrew after disclosing they had 
hired undocumented domestics. 
</P>
<P>
 The media firestorm shed new light on 1950s-era regulations that had turned 
virtually every parent with a Friday-night baby-sitter into a tax cheat. It 
also put pressure on Congress to update the rules for the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Social Security Domestic Employment Reform Act of 1994 does just that. The 
law relaxes rules on high-school baby-sitters, raises filing thresholds and 
significantly reduces the requisite paperwork. It also provides a fairly simple 
way for individuals to go about paying the taxes. Better still, it's 
retroactive -- in effect for this year starting Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, if you haven't yet paid employment taxes for a domestic worker 
hired in 1994, you have not broken the law. If you have paid taxes on someone 
who earned less than $1,000 during the year, you could be due a refund. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislators say they expect compliance with nanny tax laws to soar because 
many of the hurdles to doing so have been removed. Only about 25% of those with 
household workers are believed to be in compliance with the previous law, 
partly because it was time-consuming and difficult to comply. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, for instance, you needed to file between six and 18 forms -- 
depending on where you lived and how much you paid domestic workers -- on any 
household employee who earned more than $50 in three months. Under the new law, 
you will not be bothered with so-called nanny taxes until you pay someone 
$1,000 a year or more. Starting in 1996, the $1,000 filing threshold will be 
indexed for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the new law exempts teen-agers who baby-sit part-time from filing 
requirements. Taxes and forms are due only for adults over 18 or for those 
whose "primary occupation" is domestic work. (The primary occupation for most 
teen-agers is "student," according to tax authorities.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Further, starting in 1995, the paperwork is cut dramatically. Now if you 
employ a domestic worker, you must file quarterly 942 forms with the federal 
government. These forms spell out the names of your workers, their Social 
Security numbers, their wages and the amount of Social Security taxes due. You 
must also remit a check for Social Security and Medicare taxes when you send 
the forms. Under the new law, there will be a new section added to the 1040 -- 
the standard tax form for anyone who itemizes deductions -- that will ask about 
employment taxes for domestic employees. Although the precise wording for it 
isn't known yet, the IRS anticipates that you'll be able to note your 
employment tax obligation on the 1040 without filing an additional form, and 
you'll be able to pay the tax through additional withholding or quarterly tax 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
 The law also requires the Treasury Secretary to compile and provide 
educational materials for domestic employers, explaining their rights and 
responsibilities under federal and state laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some of the confusing elements of the previous law will remain. For 
instance, for many families the toughest hurdle is determining whether or not 
they really have an employee. Someone who works for you could either be 
considered your employee or an independent contractor. If that person is an 
independent contractor, you won't owe Social Security taxes, nor will you have 
to file employment forms related to his or her work. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS puts out a booklet, "Employee or Independent Contractor?," that aims 
to help you determine with a set of 20 questions. Because of the variables 
involved, though, the questions may not make your particular case clear. (You 
can order the booklet from the IRS at (800) 829-3676.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In general, however, the determining factors have to do with control. Do you 
set the worker's hours, provide him or her with supplies and give instruction 
on how the job should be done? Are you responsible for providing this 
individual with the bulk of his or her income? If so, he or she is probably an 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
 If the worker brings his or her own tools, sets his or her own hours, gets 
little or no instruction, and earns a substantial portion of his or her income 
from other sources, then that person is probably an independent contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, although the new law substantially reduces federal paperwork, 
employers must still grapple with the copious and confusing state forms and 
filing requirements. The amount of paperwork varies based on where you live and 
how much you pay. Generally, though, anyone who has a full-time nanny, 
housekeeper or, in some cases, gardener, needs to file state income and 
unemployment tax forms too. The Changes in Baby-Sitting Taxes 
</P>
<P>
 How does the new nanny tax law differ from previous law? 
</P>
<P>
 * Old law: Social Security and Medicare taxes must be paid for any domestic 
worker who earns more than $50 in three months. 
</P>
<P>
 * New law: Social Security and Medicare taxes must be paid for any adult 
employee who earns more than $1,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 * Old law: Even high school baby-sitters are considered employees, required to 
pay Social Security and Medicare taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 * New law: Part-time teen-age workers are exempted from filing and tax 
requirements. Only adults, over the age of 18, or those whose primary 
occupation is domestic work must pay the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 * Old law: Federal filing requirements dictate that employers send in 
quarterly 942 forms and pay employment taxes in four annual installments. The 
taxes amount to 12.4% of wages for Social Security and 2.9% of wages for 
Medicare. The obligation is technically split, with the employer paying half 
and the worker paying half. But the employer is the one charged with sending 
the payments in to the government. 
</P>
<P>
 * New law: In 1995, employers must file annual statements with their 1040 
forms, noting their status as domestic employers and listing their employment 
tax obligations. The tax needs only to be paid once annually, when the employer 
is filing his or her personal tax return. For 1994, a year-end 942 form must be 
filed. However, starting in 1998, employment taxes must be paid "ratably" 
throughout the year either through quarterly estimated payments or employee 
withholding.

<P>
 Orange County voters are split evenly on the controversial and closely watched 
Measure A, which would require a commercial airport at El Toro, with a fifth of 
the electorate undecided as Election Day nears, a new poll shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Orange County Poll also found unusually low voter recognition for 
the measure, despite almost two years of debate on the issue. Four in 10 
reported that they had not heard of the initiative. Even among likely voters, 
one-third had not heard of Measure A. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll, a telephone survey of 600 registered voters, shows that neither side 
has mustered a majority, and the election may hinge on the 21% who say they are 
undecided. Supporters and opponents are almost dead even, with 39% favoring the 
measure and 40% opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Proponents still have to persuade people that an airport is the best possible 
solution. They haven't succeeded in making this argument to the voters," said 
Mark Baldassare, who conducted The Times Orange County Poll. Measure A 
proponents have failed so far to get their message across, he said, though they 
have a consistent core of support for their airport plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The new poll shows a big increase in the undecided vote since a similar poll 
was taken in May, before the measure had qualified for the ballot, but no 
increase in airport support. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents hope to turn that around this week with a $440,000 cash infusion 
from George L. Argyros, a developer and architect of Measure A. Argyros made 
the contributions in the last two weeks to the Yes on Measure A Committee, 
which is expected to use the money to mail campaign literature. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the initiative say it will create 21,000 new jobs and generate 
millions for the local economy. Opponents say an airport at El Toro would harm 
the quality of life in South County and the same economic benefits can be 
reaped by finding an alternative use for the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station 
when the 4,700-acre base closes in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews, some poll respondents said they are wary of the initiative 
because it is sponsored by developers with ties to Orange County's political 
establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've opposed it from the beginning because it's the brainchild of a group of 
millionaire developers who put it together to promote their own interests. I 
don't buy the argument that an airport would lead to thousands of jobs. The 
only ones who gain anything from this would be the developers. There's nothing 
in this for the public," said Miriam Sheddon of Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 In the recent poll, support among likely voters was only slightly better than 
the electorate at large, with 41% saying they would vote yes on the measure and 
38% opposing it. The undecided vote remained at 21%. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, ballot measures have difficulty succeeding when there is a 
large undecided group or when voters do not hold strong views in favor of it. 
It is easier for the public to simply vote no when it remains unpersuaded about 
an issue, Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the survey showed that support for the airport initiative is lagging 
and remarkably few people have strongly held positive views on the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Several poll respondents said in follow-up interviews that they had received 
little or no information about the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a strong inclination one way or the other. I guess you could say 
I'm one of the undecided," said Beverly Brenna of Anaheim. "If I lived closer 
(to El Toro), I think I would probably have a position. But right now I'm more 
interested in the governor's race and in the state propositions." 
</P>
<P>
 As the campaign enters its final week, Measure A continues to polarize the 
county along geographic lines, with voters in the North and Central County 
supporting it by 43% to 34% and South County voters rejecting it by more than a 
2-to-1 ratio. 
</P>
<P>
 There are supporters in South County, however, who are being won over by the 
message that the airport will bring economic improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Niguel resident Albert Minoofar said he has supported Measure A from 
the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a lot of people are against it, but we can't close the door to jobs. I 
think an airport will create the jobs needed to expand Orange County's economy 
and bring prosperity to everyone. There's no doubt that an airport attracts 
businesses, but I don't think that the people who put this (Measure A) together 
have done a good job of educating the public. I'm amazed that I haven't seen 
all that much about the initiative except what I've read in the paper," 
Minoofar said. 
</P>
<P>
 To some degree, the two-year debate about putting a civilian airport at the 
base has had an impact. When given a choice of options, voters most often pick 
an airport as the best future use for the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station: 31% 
said they favored an airport, 15% opted for an industrial center, 13% chose 
residential housing, 12% preferred a transit center and 6% a jail or prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the overall soft support for the measure is apparent even among 
voters who favor Measure A. More than one-third who will vote yes on the 
initiative said they favor something other than an airport. In addition, half 
of the undecided voters also prefer using the base for something other than an 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, only 44% of all voters in the county think that putting a 
commercial airport at El Toro is the most fiscally sound use of the base. An 
almost equal number, 37%, disagree. Of the 44% who agreed an airport is the 
best choice, only 24% strongly agree it is the most fiscally sound use, while 
20% somewhat agree. 
</P>
<P>
 But the measure's soft support is also apparent among likely voters. Not even 
a majority of likely voters -- 45% -- agree that a commercial airport at El 
Toro is the most fiscally sound use of the Marine base, while 37% strongly 
disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to buying the strongest argument of the proponents, only 28% 
strongly agree that an airport would create jobs and improve the Orange County 
economy, down from 34% in May. The Times Orange County Poll 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Orange County Poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare and Associates. 
The telephone survey of 600 Orange County registered voters was conducted Oct. 
22-25 on weekday nights and weekend days. A computer-generated random sample of 
telephone numbers was used. Once a household was reached, we asked to speak 
with a registered voter. The margin of error for the total sample is plus or 
minus 4% at the 95% confidence level. That means it is 95% certain the results 
are within 4 percentage points of what they would be if every registered voter 
in Orange County were interviewed. The margin of error would be larger for 
subgroups, such as likely voters (plus or minus 5%). 
</P>
<P>
 Note: Results might not add up to 100% because of rounding. El Toro Conversion 
Splits Voters 
</P>
<P>
 Measure A, which would stipulate that El Toro Marine Corps Air Station become 
a commercial airport upon the Marines' departure, divides county voters, with 
about four in 10 on each side of the issue. The cutting characteristic is 
geography, with those in South County lining up heavily against the proposal 
and northerners voting in favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure A on the Orange County ballot would designate the Marine Corps Air 
Station at El Toro for civil aviation and related purposes. If the election 
were held today, would you vote yes or no on Measure A? 04,12,08,08,05 North

 Behind the Votes 
</P>
<P>
 While most residents agree Measure A would create jobs and spur the local 
economy, there is less accord over whether a commercial airport would be the 
best use of taxpayer money. And, a big majority agrees that any such airport 
would create excessive noise in the neighboring communities.

NEWS ANALYSIS; CLINTON COURTED U.S. VOTERS WITH MIDEAST SWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the final moment of the central strategic stop on President Clinton's 
three-day trek through the Middle East. At the foot of the Air Force One 
stairs, Syria's president, Hafez Assad, bade farewell to his guest. Leaning 
close, Assad offered a parting word: "Much success in the coming elections." 
</P>
<P>
 The Syrian president does not have to run for office -- his far-spread 
security services keep him in power -- but having dealt with U.S. presidents 
for a generation, he knows that foreign policy and domestic politics move down 
closely linked tracks in America. Those linkages were seldom more clear than in 
this most recent trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The cynical view that Clinton traveled to the Middle East solely for political 
reasons is almost certainly wrong. Finding a way toward peace in the region has 
been a leading concern of Clinton's, as of all of his recent predecessors. 
Having promised Jordan's King Hussein and Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin 
months ago that he would come to the region when they signed a peace treaty, he 
had little choice but to follow through. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the focus of Clinton's attention remained on foreign policy, 
domestic political considerations were never far from his mind or, as Assad's 
comment indicated, the minds of those he met. 
</P>
<P>
 Reminders came repeatedly. There was Hillary Rodham Clinton leaving Jerusalem 
near midnight, after her husband's speech to the Israeli Knesset, to fly 16 
hours in order to attend a Hollywood Women's Political Caucus luncheon Friday. 
And there was the President summoning reporters after his meeting with the emir 
of Kuwait to deliver a brief statement on the latest statistics from back home 
showing continued economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, there was the schedule. White House officials put together a 
six-nation, seven-city tour including two major speeches, a visit to U.S. 
troops, attendance at a formal peace treaty signing ceremony and a lengthy, 
high-stakes negotiating session with Assad. It was a 95-hour marathon that left 
the President puffy-faced, red-eyed and visibly weary. 
</P>
<P>
 Over-scheduling Clinton has been one of the Administration's most common 
problems. But this schedule exceeded even the usual exhaustive standard. The 
reason was simple -- politics. 
</P>
<P>
 In characteristic fashion, Clinton refused to limit his objectives for the 
trip. In similarly characteristic fashion, he insisted on a double-time pace to 
minimize his absence from the domestic political circuit in these closing days 
before next week's midterm elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The events would begin with an elaborate photo opportunity as the President 
attended the signing of the first peace treaty between Israel and an Arab state 
in 15 years. The ceremony was in Jordan, so a visit with King Hussein was in 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 The stop in Damascus was added, Clinton said, because "if I was coming to the 
region, I felt I had to do Syria." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Clinton could not visit the Arabs without stopping in Israel. Nor 
could he go everywhere else in the region without seeing Egypt's President 
Hosni Mubarak, aides argued. They also believed that the President should not 
pass up a visit to U.S. troops deployed in Kuwait to deter an Iraqi attack -- 
even if the stop meant that Clinton would have to also visit Saudi and Kuwaiti 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Sleep, apparently, was of less importance. Clinton arrived in Cairo, his first 
stop on the trip, about 1 a.m. Wednesday and, after arrival ceremonies, stayed 
up until nearly 2:30 chatting with Mubarak. He was awakened less than four 
hours later to prepare for a formal meeting with Mubarak and PLO Chairman 
Yasser Arafat before flying on to Jordan for the ceremony marking the signing 
of the Israel-Jordan peace treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 That afternoon, Clinton dozed on the 45-minute flight from Aqaba to Amman. On 
arrival, he kept King Hussein and Queen Noor waiting at the airport for 15 
minutes -- a slip-up in protocol that aides did not deny was caused by his nap. 
Hours later, after speaking to the Jordanian Parliament, Clinton held another 
late-night session, this one with Hussein, that lasted well into the wee hours. 
He then arose at dawn for the flight to Damascus to meet with Assad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm on my last leg. I'm really tired," he told reporters that afternoon on 
the flight from Damascus to Tel Aviv. At that point, he still had 36 hours to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the exhaustion, the trip provided Clinton with some clear benefits. "I 
came away, frankly, with a much clearer idea of what things the United States 
can do and, indeed, what we must try to do to help make peace successful," 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip, he said, gave him a chance "to see firsthand the potential for a new 
Middle East, the real potential for peace and the yearning for it." 
</P>
<P>
 "These are all things that you know, but until you see it, it's a very 
different thing indeed," Clinton said. "I have seen it on the streets of every 
place I have been, and in the eyes of the people." 
</P>
<P>
 But the impact of the trip was far less than it could have been. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and his aides repeatedly complain that the public does not fully 
comprehend the accomplishments of his Administration. And yet they also 
repeatedly do their work in a way that makes effective communication 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, for example, Clinton gave two major speeches, one each to the 
parliaments of Jordan and Israel, that went largely unnoticed in much of the 
press because both were overshadowed by earlier events the same day -- the 
peace treaty signing and the meeting in Damascus, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 And on his final day, although Army and White House planners put together a 
setting for the President's visit to the troops that looked gorgeous on 
television, the exhausted President had little energy left to deliver the sort 
of speech that might have made for a memorable event. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end, Clinton's eyes were closing involuntarily as he stood in Kuwait's 
Bayan Palace listening to the emir read the citation of an award the Kuwaitis 
were presenting him. 
</P>
<P>
 While the trip was less than it might have been, it did further Middle East 
diplomacy and perhaps will yield political dividends as well. 
</P>
<P>
 On the diplomatic front, Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Rabin insist that 
while the President's visit with Assad did not produce a public breakthrough in 
peace talks, it did advance the agenda significantly -- enough so that senior 
Administration officials now talk of the chance that a historic deal between 
Israel and Syria might be reached by next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides also hope the influence of extremists will be reduced by the impact of 
Clinton's speeches in Jordan, in which he talked of American respect for Islam, 
and in Israel, in which he sought to reassure Israelis about their security as 
they proceed with peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 As the President traveled, back home the prospects for a number of Democratic 
candidates appeared to rise. Analysts say at least some of that may be 
attributable to an improved public view of Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the complete remaking of Bill Clinton," political analyst Stuart 
Rothenberg said. "It has not changed the lay of the political landscape, and it 
has not fundamentally altered the mood of cynicism and distrust among voters. 
And the public still has doubts about Bill Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, "his numbers have moved up from bad to barely mediocre, but even 
that is an improvement and an accomplishment. In terms of broader impact, it 
has added to some Democratic optimism about upcoming elections. There is now 
some hopefulness, when a few weeks ago it was total despair." 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief rest this weekend, Clinton will try to make the most of that 
shifted mood. Over the next eight days, he plans to be on the road nonstop with 
trips to a dozen states, including a final six-day campaign swing before the 
election as he attempts to make Assad's parting wishes for "much success" come 
true.

GUNMAN FIRES ON WHITE HOUSE; SHOOTING: PRESIDENT IS NOT HARMED IN ASSAULT-RIFLE 
ATTACK. PASSERSBY ON PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE TACKLE SUSPECT, IDENTIFIED AS A 
COLORADO MAN. IT IS THE SECOND BREACH OF SECURITY IN AS MANY MONTHS. 
</P>

<P>
 A Colorado man standing among tourists in front of the White House pulled a 
Chinese-made assault rifle from beneath his trench coat Saturday and fired 20 
to 30 shots at the mansion and the West Wing, where President Clinton has his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured, and White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta told 
reporters: "The President and his family were never in any danger." 
</P>
<P>
 The suspected gunman was subdued by passersby. Federal officials, who took the 
man into custody, said they could not immediately assign a motive to the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 They identified him as Francisco Martin Duran, 26, a hotel worker from the 
Colorado Springs, Colo., area, and said he was carrying an SKS semiautomatic 
rifle, a weapon similar to an AK-47, a firearm banned recently by congressional 
anti-crime legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Griffin, chief of protective operations for the Secret Service, said 
he believes that Duran was acting alone, but he cautioned that the 
investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not characterize this as an assassination attempt at all, no way," 
Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a source familiar with the investigation said statements from Duran 
indicate that he may have a grudge against Clinton. Such statements could be 
used by authorities to support a charge of attempted assassination of the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta, who was at work in the White House when the shooting erupted about 3 
p.m. EDT, said the President was watching a college football game on television 
in his upstairs living quarters when he heard the crack of the gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was on a trip to California and the couple's 
daughter, Chelsea, was away from the White House at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta said that after determining what had happened, he went upstairs to 
brief the President. Panetta said Clinton "wasn't shaken at all" and that he 
expressed appreciation that nearby tourists subdued the suspect until uniformed 
Secret Service officers rushed onto the sidewalk to take him into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Saturday, Clinton, speaking to the National Italian American Foundation, 
praised the "ordinary citizens" who apprehended the gunman and said the 
incident demonstrated why Congress was right in passing the crime bill, which 
included a ban on some assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement sources in El Paso County, which encompasses the Colorado 
Springs area, said Duran disappeared from home nearly a month ago, telling his 
wife he needed to buy materials for target practice. They said he was employed 
at the posh Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado Springs and is the father of a 
4-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Dean Kelsey, a spokesman for the El Paso County sheriff's office, told 
Reuters News Service that Duran's wife filed a missing-person report on Oct. 1. 
Kelsey said marital problems were not listed in her report as a possible reason 
for his disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Duran's wife told law officials that he left their home in a brown Chevrolet 
S-10 pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators swarmed over a vehicle matching that description near the White 
House after the shootings. The pickup, with Colorado plates, had bumper 
stickers with these slogans: "Fire Butch Reno," an apparent reference to Atty. 
Gen. Janet Reno, and "Those Who Beat Their Guns Into Plows Will Plow for Those 
Who Don't." 
</P>
<P>
 The Duran family lives in a two-story house in the unincorporated community of 
Security-Widefield, about 10 miles southeast of Colorado Springs. On Saturday 
evening, the house, decorated for Halloween with a large orange pumpkin in an 
upper window and the silhouette of a werewolf on the front door, was surrounded 
by the vehicles of TV news crews and print journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Several neighbors described Duran as a "strange" and reclusive young man who 
angered many of them by not keeping up the yard of the house he moved into 
about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Duran, who worked as an upholsterer at the nearby Broadmoor, was often seen 
covering furniture in his garage late at night. One neighbor, who asked that 
her name not be used, said he was a "sorry young man who watched TV all day 
long in his pajamas and left all the yard work for his wife to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Another neighbor, Candi Howman, 28, said she regrets letting her 9-year-old 
son play with Duran's boy. "He could have lost it in my own neighborhood," she 
said, shaking her head. "From now on, I'm going to get to know my children's 
friends' parents a little better." 
</P>
<P>
 Duran served in the Army from 1987 to 1991, and there were no records of 
mental, emotional or drug problems, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the White House briefing, Panetta and Griffin gave no response to questions 
about Duran's mental health. 
</P>
<P>
 A witness, Lee Brooks, 24, of Newark, Ohio, was standing on the Pennsylvania 
Avenue sidewalk with other tourists 10 or 12 feet from the gunman when the 
shooting began. Brooks said the gunman pulled the weapon from beneath his 
loose-fitting, gray trench coat and began firing through the bars of the 
10-foot-high wrought-iron fence that separates the White House grounds from the 
sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just aimed at the front steps of the White House and started shooting," 
Brooks said. "It took about five shots before anyone realized what was 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
 The shots traveled about 100 yards across the broad expanse of the White House 
front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks said that after emptying his first clip of ammunition, the gunman ran 
east along Pennsylvania Avenue while trying to reload. Two men in the crowd 
tackled Duran and authorities arrived to subdue him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said one of the men, Robert Haines, was walking a baby in a stroller 
before the incident. "We held him down until the Secret Service took him into 
custody," said Haines, who identified himself as an independent candidate for 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors on the sidewalk seemed stunned. Some had been roller-blading or 
walking their dogs in the warm autumn afternoon. Police sealed off access to 
the White House for the next several hours, swarming across the lawn to search 
for shell casings. Tourists with video cameras recorded the scene for their 
memories of the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was detained for questioning at a security post on the White House 
grounds before being driven away for fingerprinting and further interrogation. 
At a Secret Service field office, he invoked his right to have an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we can do is make him comfortable, get him water and food," said Special 
Agent Tim Cahill. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said the U.S. attorney's office was 
considering what charges would be filed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time in memory that shots had been fired at the White House. 
Panetta said three bullets "fired randomly" hit the Executive Mansion's north 
portico and five others chipped the exterior plaster facing of the West Wing 
and broke a window in the White House press briefing room. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin compared Saturday's incident to the drive-by shootings and other 
episodes of gunfire that happen daily in large cities. "Based on that, we 
shouldn't be shocked that a circumstance like this could present itself," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For security reasons, the President's ground-level Oval Office cannot be seen 
from any point outside the White House grounds, and the family living quarters 
do not face Pennsylvania Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta said the Secret Service would immediately expand a review of 
presidential security it began last month after a despondent Maryland resident 
crashed a small single-engine aircraft on the South Lawn of the White House, 
killing himself in what has been described as an apparent suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta and Griffin downplayed any suggestions that White House security is at 
risk, but they hinted that some changes may occur early next year when the 
Secret Service review is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President is in no danger whatever," Griffin said. He added, however, 
that the Secret Service for years has recommended closing off the two-block 
stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House. That has been done

hosted the signing of the Middle East peace agreement between Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser 
Arafat last year.

 Panetta said incidents like the shooting "obviously raise concern, and we have 
to look at the situation." But there is "a fine balance" between beefing up 
White House security and allowing the public a close look at a cherished 
landmark. Electronic monitoring devices line the 10-foot fence and visitors to 
the grounds must walk through metal detectors.

 Panetta said Clinton planned no change in his weekend schedule. "We'll all go 
to church tomorrow and be thankful that no one was injured," he said.

 Officials said that in May the President barred any further imports into the 
United States of the SKS rifle. The President took that action as he extended 
China's trade privileges in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, about 
400,000 of these weapons were exported to this country from 1989 through 1993.

<P>
 Aside from regular public tours, the White House grounds are closed to the 
public and uniformed Secret Service agents are stationed at several guardhouses 
where the press and visitors are admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 There is normal pedestrian traffic in front of the White House and the street 
itself is a major cross-town thoroughfare. Concrete barriers line nearby 
streets to deter automobile attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The first fence at the White House was erected on the building's north side 
along Pennsylvania Avenue in 1818 and was extended along the east and west 
sides of the grounds in 1869.

COLUMN ONE; HEIMLICH'S AUDACIOUS MANEUVER; HE PROPOSES CURING AIDS BY GIVING 
PATIENTS MALARIA. TESTS DRAW CELEBRITY MONEY -- AND RESEARCHERS' PROTESTS. HE 
SHRUGS OFF CRITICISM, NOTING HIS ANTI-CHOKING METHOD WAS ALSO SHUNNED AT FIRST.

 The famous guests made their way through the rain into the warmth of Joanne 
Carson's candle-lit Bel-Air home. Just beyond the door, they found a small 
registration table. Esther Williams, Patti Davis, Jon Voight, Bruce Davison and 
other luminaries dutifully signed in. 
</P>
<P>
 The guest of honor -- a tall intense-looking man in his 70s -- waited in the 
kitchen. Everyone had heard about him, but few had met him. As they filed by to 
shake his hand, Dr. Henry Heimlich nodded and smiled. "Thanks for coming. Thank 
you for your support." 
</P>
<P>
 It was spring, 1993, and Heimlich, bold inventor of the anti-choking maneuver, 
had come to Los Angeles with a bold pitch: To end the scourge AIDS by 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The room fell silent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were awe-struck," recalled Carson. "We all said, 'This is hot. This could 
be it!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Heimlich's prescription for AIDS? Give the patient malaria. 
</P>
<P>
 With no shortage of malaria in the world -- or of desperate AIDS patients -- 
all he needed was the money. And from Hollywood's best and brightest, he would 
get it. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were so moved by his presentations, that at the end of the evening, 
everybody went home and sent their checks in," recalled Carson, who hosted 
three fund-raising dinners last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Actress Amy Irving gave $50,000. Other major supporters included actress 
Estelle Getty, high-powered agent Sandy Bresler and ventriloquist Paul 
Winchell, according to Heimlich's foundation and other sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Fueled by hundreds of thousands of dollars from such celebrity donations, 
Heimlich researchers have begun injecting a small group of HIV-positive men in 
China with malaria-infected blood. 
</P>
<P>
 At best, warn infectious disease experts, the treatment will cause no harm. At 
worst, they say, it can kill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heimlich's life-saving maneuver for people who aspirate food doesn't qualify 
one as an HIV expert," said leading AIDS researcher Dr. Anthony Fauci, who 
called malaria therapy "quite dangerous and scientifically unsound." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview this month Heimlich dismissed criticism of his plan. He said 
no one has been harmed by the treatment and that the first two patients were 
already "feeling better." Still, he cautioned against "false hopes." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a long way to go," said Heimlich, who expects no final results for 
another year or two. Nevertheless, he added, "we could always benefit by having 
more funds." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time the 74-year-old Heimlich's headstrong approach to 
medicine has shocked, even outraged the Establishment. "I don't do ordinary 
things. I don't follow all the rules if there's a better, faster way to do it," 
he boasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Induced malaria therapy -- IMT, as he calls it -- consists of "inoculating" 
patients with blood teeming with malaria parasites. Citing the use of a similar 
therapy for neurosyphilis in the 1920s, Heimlich believes malaria induces 
production of immune substances that could help patients overcome HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 The tiny pathogen that causes malaria -- the protozoan Plasmodium -- 
flourishes in the human body, growing inside red blood cells until the cells 
burst. Without enough red cells to carry oxygen, even patients with the most 
benign strains can suffer severe anemia and die from renal failure or 
convulsions from 106-degree fevers. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing concerns for the safety of human subjects, a group of 20 scientists and 
physicians from the United States and Mexico have petitioned top U.S. 
regulatory agencies to investigate Heimlich's Hollywood fund-raising campaign 
and the touted treatment of HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 "This exploits the AIDS crisis, exploits the generous and caring entertainment 
community, and it exploits the good that Heimlich himself has done in the 
past," said Dr. Paul Bronston, national ethics chair of the American College of 
Medical Quality and a petition supporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "(That petition) is an annoying and painful thing," Heimlich said. "But this 
happens. It's very common in my life. Some people think if they attack a famous 
person, they can become as famous as the assassin . . . Just as the Kennedy 
assassins became famous. 
</P>
<P>
 "And our work takes time. Look, it took the Red Cross 12 1/2 years to 
(endorse) the Heimlich maneuver." Unproven Therapies 
</P>
<P>
 In the absence of a cure for AIDS, underground trafficking in unproven, 
experimental therapies is thriving here and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Desperate for even a crumb of hope, patients have ingested photographic 
chemicals, been sealed in hyperbaric chambers and taken injections of 
everything from snake venom to hydrogen peroxide. 
</P>
<P>
 What stands out about the malaria treatment is that, like the anti-choking 
maneuver, it carries the imprimatur of Heimlich. 
</P>
<P>
 "His name carries a lot of weight," said one loyal Hollywood supporter. "For 
many of us in the entertainment industry, meeting him was like meeting Albert 
Schweitzer. And sure, that affected our generosity." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something about making movies that makes you believe in miracles," 
said actress Esther Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "No question he's one of the great geniuses of our time. I expect he will 
receive a Nobel prize," said Carson, ex-wife of former "Tonight" show host 
Johnny Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 She invited Heimlich to Los Angeles, she said, "because I wanted to help him. 
I think he is very close to the answer and I wanted to get people together who 
really cared so Hank could talk to them and raise the money he needed to start 
the project." 
</P>
<P>
 The entertainment community has lost too many of its own to wait any longer, 
say Carson and other Heimlich supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the search for a cure risks lives? "Well," Bresler said, "that's the 
way it is. This is not a party. People who have HIV are going to die anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have volunteers willing to sacrifice themselves for the good of 
mankind, I'm all for it." 'Creative' Approach 
</P>
<P>
 From the day he picked up his M.D. from Cornell Medical College in 1943, Henry 
Jay Heimlich has reveled in his knack for doing what others say cannot be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never had a failure," he says with bracing -- if not always accurate 
-- self-regard. "It may take a while for the others to see what I see. But 
eventually, they do. Like I always say, 'If your peers understand what you've 
done, you are not being creative.' " 
</P>
<P>
 No question, this man is creative. As a 35-year-old chest surgeon, he devised 
a way to reconstruct an esophagus from a patient's stomach. He called it the 
Heimlich Operation -- "the world's first transplant." 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the Heimlich Chest Drainage Valve, first fashioned from a rubber 
dime-store toy that makes a Bronx cheer when you blow on it: "That valve saved 
lives on both sides of the Vietnam War and is still saving lives today." 
</P>
<P>
 He invented the Heimlich Micro Trach to provide portable oxygen for patients 
with debilitating lung disease. In news reports, patients called it "the 
Heimlich Miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 But it is as the creator of the Heimlich Maneuver that the irrepressible 
inventor is most famous. "According to Norman Vincent Peale, I've probably 
saved more lives than any man living today," Heimlich says. (Officials estimate 
that 4,000 to 5,000 people are rescued each year by his method, which involves 
wrapping one's arms around the victim from behind and thrusting a fist between 
the rib cage and navel.) 
</P>
<P>
 But with his unconventional approaches have come controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a decade neither the American Red Cross nor the American Heart 
Assn. would endorse the maneuver because they said Heimlich could not provide 
scientific proof that it worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Heimlich's response? "We used the media. We couldn't wait for more people to 
die. We went right to the people and we taught them how to do it on TV. We were 
saving lives while the Red Cross was still telling people to slap choking kids 
on the back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was right," Heimlich said, "and they knew it and they risked lives by not 
going along. Creative thinking begins with not accepting anything that is 
supposed to be fact." 
</P>
<P>
 But over the last 20 years, skeptics say the doctor's work has moved closer 
and closer to the fringe. In the last decade, he has proposed treatments for 
AIDS, cancer, asthma, even war. 
</P>
<P>
 Heimlich and his nonprofit institute are based in Cincinnati, where he brought 
his chest surgery practice, his wife and four children nearly 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Murray Heimlich, a daughter of the famed dance team of Arthur and Kathryn 
Murray, is an advocate of alternative medicine and best-selling author of "What 
Your Doctor Won't Tell You." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Heimlich, the work of controversial physician Julian 
Wagner-Jauregg -- who won a Nobel Prize in 1927 for using malaria to treat 
syphilis of the brain -- inspired his early interest. 
</P>
<P>
 But the widow of Leonard B. Greentree, a Harvard-trained Ohio physician who 
published a 1981 paper on malaria therapy, believes her husband's work was 
equally inspirational to Heimlich. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody courted my husband for his ideas as much as Dr. Heimlich," recalled 
Edith F. Greentree. "In 1982, we met with Dr. Heimlich at his home in 
Cincinnati for the expressed purpose of discussing my husband's hypothesis that 
malaria might be a cure for cancer. Dr. Heimlich wanted us to give him money 
(to) set up a foundation and Dr. Greentree said, 'Wait a minute, this idea is 
mine. I want a controlled study someplace, not publicity.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But, his critics say, controlled studies are not Heimlich's style. When he 
first advocated the anti-choking method his research consisted almost entirely 
of collecting anecdotes on how the maneuver was saving lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Greentree, Heimlich first envisioned malaria therapy as a cancer 
treatment. For that disease as well as for Lyme disease and HIV, Heimlich 
believes malaria can stimulate immune responses. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1980s, Heimlich asked the Centers for Disease Control to help him 
get malaria-infected blood for his studies. When plans to do the research here 
collapsed, Heimlich's foundation offered its support to doctors in Mexico, 
Panama and China. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the "successes" of those cancer experiments are cited in Heimlich's 
Hollywood appeal for AIDS research funding, no reports on the methods or 
results have been published for traditional scientific review. 
</P>
<P>
 "To conduct legitimate research in this country, you need a host of 
safeguards," said Bronston. The Los Angeles physician joined the petition to 
investigate Heimlich's research after attending a fund-raiser hosted by Carson, 
a friend of Heimlich's wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need review by other researchers in the field, you need careful 
protocols, you need uniform protection for the patients who are entrusting you 
with their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 But much of the Heimlich Foundation's funding appeal consists of references to 
other scientists' research -- research experts say cannot always be verified by 
outside reviewers. 
</P>
<P>
 The funding appeal describes a 1990 study in Zaire that found that a group of 
children who had malaria and AIDS were "living and well" after a two-year 
trial. "To Dr. Heimlich," potential donors were advised, "the significant 
result is that none of the malaria- infected AIDS patients died." 
</P>
<P>
 But when asked later whether those children were still alive, Heimlich said, " 
You're wondering! What about me ? Nobody tried harder than we did (to find 
out)." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Frank Sonnenberg, a Rutgers physician who evaluates research proposals for 
the National Institutes of Health, calls Heimlich's proposal "monumentally 
flawed," and says it would be "resoundingly rejected by any credible grant 
review committee." Scope Expanded 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the 1980s, Heimlich returned to Mexico to expand his experiments 
to include sufferers of Lyme disease, an arthritis-like immune disorder caused 
by a tick bite. Although most cases are easily cured by antibiotics, a small 
percentage of patients do not recover. 
</P>
<P>
 The first American Lyme disease patient to receive the malaria treatment in 
Mexico was Cyndi Monahan, a 28-year-old New Jersey aerobics instructor so 
crippled by the disease she was confined to a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 Monahan recently recalled the experiments as "exciting (and) very clandestine, 
like a drug deal. We flew down there and went to this hotel. This doctor came 
to our room and opened a black valise with these little vials of blood. He had 
(me) lie down on the bed and he injected (me) with the blood. And (I) went back 
to the States like on the next flight and pretty soon (I) broke out with 
malaria." 
</P>
<P>
 Monahan said she was cured -- for almost three weeks. "I was pretty much 
without symptoms. I could walk, I could run, I could even exercise some," she 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then I started to get sick again, and I can't tell you how disappointed I 
was. By then, I was out of money, totally bankrupt." 
</P>
<P>
 To raise the money for more malaria therapy, Monahan sought help from her 
local newspaper, which invited readers to make tax-deductible donations. The 
campaign raised about $15,000 and she returned to Mexico City where, Monahan 
said, the same doctor gave her another injection of malaria-infected blood. She 
identified the doctor as Heimlich's friend Oscar Velasco. Although Velasco said 
he does not recall Monahan specifically, he confirmed that he has worked with 
Heimlich and has treated American patients with malaria therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the second treatment took her to "a nicer hotel," Monahan said, it 
was not as effective. "Turns out I developed an immunity to malaria, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 Now 32, Monahan told The Times this spring that she is "about 65% as bad as I 
was before I took Dr. Heimlich's malaria therapy . . . But I still can't live 
on my own. I need someone to take care of me pretty much all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Heimlich said he has spoken with Monahan often, but she was never under his 
care. In fact, while the Heimlich Institute supports such research, Heimlich 
said he has never personally treated anyone with malaria therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sallie Timpone, a 34-year-old mother of three who was with Monahan in Mexico 
City, has been speaking out against both Heimlich and malaria therapy for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she, too, experienced an early remission, Timpone says she is now as 
sick as ever: "I've been hooked up to IVs of antibiotics but nothing really 
helps. I'm so sick and weak most days I can hardly get out of bed. But if 
anybody ever asked me about Dr. Heimlich and his supposed cure, I wouldn't 
hesitate to tell them to run away fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I called him again and again and told him to stop using me as an example 
of how malaria therapy was the cure for Lyme disease," Timpone said, "he never 
called me back and kept telling people I was fine, when I am definitely not 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Heimlich said that he first met Timpone at a medical meeting. "She had had a 
complete remission, I recall, but I know she didn't take the full course of 
malaria treatment." Other Lyme patients, said Heimlich, have been symptom-free 
for five years. "In certain cases, we've had remarkable results, OK? My God, 
(what) if I told you about a woman who was crawling for several years on the 
floor because of Lyme disease and she owns 15 horses now and is riding them!" 
</P>
<P>
 Heimlich refused to identify the woman or other patients, citing 
confidentiality. High Risk Cited 
</P>
<P>
 By the spring of 1993, when Heimlich was nibbling hors d'oeuvres with 
Hollywood celebrities, Dr. Sergio Perez Barrio was preparing to receive the 
first HIV patients for malaria injections in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them were to be volunteers from the Los Angeles area -- men with the 
AIDS virus who, Heimlich said, would be cared for before and after their 
treatments by "courageous" local physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, a former public health officer for the border towns around Juarez, says 
he was handpicked by Heimlich to conduct the first malaria trials. But by early 
this year, Perez said, he told Heimlich that the risk to HIV patients was too 
high. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about the money it would cost to care for AIDS patients and the 
risk of exposing them to malaria," Perez said. "And I believe that is when he 
decided not to proceed with the trials here in Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 Heimlich, who says he draws no salary for his role in the research, said 
Perez's estimate of $18,000 a patient was too high. He added that that "the 
costs increased markedly when it became apparent that Americans would be 
involved." When the site of the trials was switched to China, U.S. patients 
were disqualified, he said. Probes Sought 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of millions have been spent on government-approved AIDS studies, with 
no cure or effective treatment to show for it. Many top U.S. scientists have 
all but lost hope of finding a cure through traditional means. 
</P>
<P>
 That made Heimlich's proposal and its relatively modest $591,800 price tag 
seem well-timed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hank's work doesn't involve hundreds of patients and all of that investment," 
said Heimlich's long-time friend and research consultant, Dr. Harry Gibbons, 
retired public health director for Salt Lake City. "In many ways, he's offering 
a real bargain." 
</P>
<P>
 But Heimlich's cost-cutting does little to advance the search for a cure, 
according to Dr. Carlos del Rio, director general of Mexico's AIDS prevention 
and control agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Rio said he was "outraged by the Heimlich proposal" and told petition 
organizers they could count on his cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Rio is among the scientists and physicians who seek state and federal 
probes of Heimlich's AIDS project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are extremely concerned that the IMT proposal may be deceptive and may 
contain false conclusions," says the petition. "We are particularly concerned 
about the health and safety of those who may subject themselves to this 
treatment as well as the possible exploitative techniques for fund-raising." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug 
Administration, FBI and IRS -- the agencies addressed by the petition -- 
declined comment. But the CDC responded by issuing a public health alert. 
</P>
<P>
 In a four-page statement, three top CDC officials repeat the agency's 
opposition to malaria therapy for Lyme disease and warn against the Heimlich 
Foundation's proposal to use the treatment on HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 "No evidence currently exists to indicate that malaria infection would 
beneficially affect the course of HIV infection," said the CDC, which noted 
that malaria-infected blood could contain other contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
 CDC warned that any human research "should undergo thorough ethical review," 
and said the deliberate infection of humans with malaria "cannot be justified." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike traditional research protocols, few Heimlich projects begin in the 
laboratory, or even with laboratory animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he is philosophically opposed to animal research, Heimlich's guinea 
pigs are usually humans. 
</P>
<P>
 That and his failure to publish his research, to expose it to the rigors of 
peer review, have been the source of persistent criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Heimlich told The Times this month that he had agreed to cooperate with the 
China-based doctors in publishing the AIDS research results as soon as there is 
solid data to report. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the results look favorable," Heimlich said, "we'll certainly reach out for 
more volunteers -- and more support." 
</P>
<P>
 Heimlich said that the nine HIV-positive patients who have been infected with 
malarial blood are men in their 20s and 30s who have given informed consent. 
"Our protocols meet all the standards -- exceed the standards -- required in 
the U.S. I am very strict," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The AIDS project's protocol calls for patients to receive "inoculations of 
malaria parasites" and be admitted to a medical facility. After 10 to 14 fevers 
-- spiking near 106 degrees over three to four weeks -- the researchers 
administer anti-malaria medications. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Heimlich assures supporters, only "the benign form" of the disease -- the 
Plasmodium vivax strain -- is used. 
</P>
<P>
 CDC malaria specialist Peter Bloland agrees that the vivax strain is among the 
most curable, but cautions that even in the laboratory, great care must be 
taken to guarantee that that is the only malaria parasite in a sample and that 
no other blood-borne diseases are present. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rarely is malaria-infected blood used for such research," said Bloland. "We 
most always rely on mosquitoes specially bred to (harbor) the specific malaria 
parasite we want to use." 
</P>
<P>
 Heimlich insists that the blood injected into the volunteers is thoroughly 
screened for other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 And the danger to patients? "With the malaria, we can stop (the treatment) if 
the patient is not doing well," Heimlich said. So far, he said, all the 
patients have "tolerated the treatment well and their malaria has been 
curable." 
</P>
<P>
 As Heimlich continues to travel the world to see patients before and after 
their malaria treatments, he says he is hurt and confused by those who question 
his work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's happened before," he said. "It's politics. Or it's financial. Or one 
scientist knows another. Or somebody is working on a vaccine for Lyme disease 
or for AIDS or what-have-you and they're afraid we'll get their funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, you know, if I have something I think is good, how can I let (the 
people) die?" Heimlich asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is risking people's lives and he is trading on the life-saving aura of his 
name to get people to help him," said Dr. John Renner of the National Council 
Against Health Fraud, which has been tracking the Heimlich project. 
</P>
<P>
 "After this, he won't go down in history for the Heimlich maneuver. He'll go 
down in history as a bizarre, mad scientist." Helping Heimlich 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Henry Heimlich's proposal to give AIDS patients blood tainted with malaria 
has attracted support from celebrities, including these three.

 For more than a decade, conservative social theorist Charles Murray has made a 
living pushing the boundaries of politically acceptable debate about the 
welfare state. But nothing the contrarian thinker has written in the past drew 
the level of vitriol now engulfing "The Bell Curve," his new best-selling book 
linking IQ to race and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray has spent the better part of the past two weeks fending off accusations 
that he and his late co-author, Richard J. Herrnstein, are reactionary racists. 
Yet only days ago, as he zipped along a Virginia highway toward his next talk 
show, Murray insisted that his book actually boosts the liberal cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's the great untold story of 'The Bell Curve,' " Murray said. "Dick 
Herrnstein and I have uncovered more data to help the left than any other 
social scientists, data which may be used to argue for massive redistribution 
of income." 
</P>
<P>
 That Murray now applies this Alice-in-Wonderland spin to his thesis -- which 
argues that most low-IQ people are doomed to a life of poverty and possibly 
crime -- is a measure of how the national debate over helping the poor promises 
to become curiouser and curiouser in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the hand-wringing punditry surrounding "The Bell Curve" has focused on 
the so-called Chapter 13 problem -- an analysis by Murray and Herrnstein, who 
was a psychology professor at Harvard University, that genetics as well as 
environmental factors account for the 15-point gap between whites and blacks on 
IQ tests. 
</P>
<P>
 But the main thesis of this 845-page book -- that IQ is largely destiny -- is 
equally incendiary in a nation founded on egalitarianism, and it could further 
polarize Washington's already strained political dialogue over how to better 
the plight of the nation's poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the short run, it will make the debate more ugly," said Robert Rector, who 
has helped fashion Republican welfare legislation from his post as senior 
policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives, likely to be emboldened after Election Day with strong GOP 
gains in Congress, can use the book's findings to make the case that government 
attempts to train the underclass to perform in the new global economy are 
doomed to failure. And if liberals want fodder for the argument that 
broad-based welfare reform designed to curb out-of-wedlock births smacks of 
eugenics, they can flip to page 548. There, Herrnstein and Murray claim that 
current U.S. welfare policies encourage the "wrong women" to have babies. 
</P>
<P>
 With 93 charts and graphs, and a 110-page appendix designed as a statistics 
primer, Murray and Herrnstein pummel the quintessentially American notion that 
all men and women are created equal, that any citizen can buy a piece of the 
dream through hard work and a healthy dose of street smarts. "The ideology of 
equality has done some good," they write, "but most of its effects are bad." 
</P>
<P>
 IQ tests, the authors contend, are the best predictors of a person's success 
in life. America's poor, its criminals, its school dropouts and unwed mothers 
typically have low cognitive abilities, Murray and Herrnstein write. They fret 
that the nation's intellectual health is dropping because low-IQ people are 
having more babies than the "cognitive elite," and because today's immigrants 
have lower IQs than past waves of newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, in an increasingly technology-driven society, they write, 
low-intelligence citizens "are becoming not just increasingly expendable in 
economic terms; they will . . . become a net drag." 
</P>
<P>
 The refusal of U.S. policy-makers to come to grips with these truths, say 
Murray and Herrnstein, accounts for the spotty success of job training or 
educational programs such as Head Start. "Taken together," they write, "the 
story of attempts to raise intelligence is one of high hopes, flamboyant 
claims, and disappointing results." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray and Herrnstein set forth what could be described as the ultimate 
root-cause argument for troubles of the nation's underclass: Poor people can't 
make it because they're stupid. And those who work in poverty programs worry 
that the book will feed a do-nothing attitude on the part of a public already 
cynical about government intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 "The risk is that we lose sight of the potential of people to change," said 
Judith M. Gueron, president of New York's Manpower Demonstration Research 
Corp., which designs and tests education and job-training programs for the 
disadvantaged. "People move in and out of poverty. They move in and out of 
employment. We're in the midst of a very mean-spirited debate about welfare and 
poverty, and this argument risks fueling that." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an incendiary book," said University of Pennsylvania sociologist Elijah 
Anderson, author of the 1990 inner-city study "Streetwise." "It gives aid and 
comfort to people who are privileged and encourages them to do nothing. It lets 
them off the hook. That's very dangerous." Anderson adds that Murray fails to 
examine the flight of jobs from the inner city as a major component of the 
poor's troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the other end of the political spectrum, "The Bell Curve" -- with 
200,000 copies in print and more to come -- is political poison oak for 
conservatives who signed onto Murray's last incendiary cause: attacking high 
rates of out-of-wedlock births by cutting off welfare payments to single 
mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that the proposals Murray makes on welfare are undercut 
by 'The Bell Curve,' " said Peter Wehner, policy director of Empower America, 
the William J. Bennett-Jack Kemp think tank that has backed welfare reform 
aimed at curbing out-of-wedlock births. "It's an inviting target for critics of 
his welfare proposals. But the welfare debate needs to be taken on its own 
merits." 
</P>
<P>
 While Murray and Herrnstein carefully distance themselves from the eugenics 
movement that earlier this century rationalized forced sterilizations and the 
Nazi Holocaust, the authors claim that America is suffering under "dysgenic 
pressure" -- the collective lowering of its intellectual potential because of 
immigration and higher fertility rates among the low-IQ poor. 
</P>
<P>
 With that assertion hanging in the air, politicians who openly fret about 
out-of-wedlock births among the poor -- a concern that for the better part of a 
decade has underpinned Murray's own proposals to end federal welfare -- are 
treading into risky political territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a very difficult mess in their back yard," a key congressional 
source said of lawmakers backing proposals to cut off welfare to unwed mothers. 
Despite Murray's protestations to the contrary, this source adds, the policy of 
ending government payments to poor single women who have children "is 
consistent with a eugenics program." 
</P>
<P>
 The Heritage Foundation's Rector agrees that "people will try to derail some 
policies by saying it's eugenics. But I don't think over the long term it will 
bear fruit." Rector adds that "The Bell Curve's" findings only demonstrate that 
"conventional marriage and family is all the more important" for low-IQ men and 
women in poverty, yet current welfare policies have undermined the family. 
</P>
<P>
 Reducing births to unwed mothers is at the heart of the Republican approach to 
reform welfare in its much-touted "contract with America." The legislation it 
promotes would prohibit cash payments but permit direct services to single 
mothers younger than 18, and would enable states to extend that rule to the age 
of 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare reform is expected to be a top priority for the Clinton Administration 
next year. And while Murray's book makes conservative opponents inviting 
targets for name-calling, private comments by Administration officials suggest 
that they aren't eager to gain political capital by equating the removal of 
children born out of wedlock from the welfare rolls with eugenics. That's 
largely because the President also hopes to address births outside of marriage 
by allowing states to cap payments for additional children, although the main 
focus of the White House welfare proposal is a work requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, sources in the Administration and on Capitol Hill predict that the 
worst denunciations will emanate from groups further to the left, who already 
have denounced family caps and welfare cuts aimed at children born out of 
wedlock as "social engineering." Martha Davis, senior staff attorney at the NOW 
Legal Defense and Education Fund, declined comment on "The Bell Curve" until 
she had read it, but noted that targeting the reproductive capacity of one 
population invites comparisons to eugenics. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray insists his newest book won't throw more gasoline on the welfare 
debate. "I don't buy the notion that this will be seized on for nefarious 
purpose," he said. "If you want to end welfare, do it for reasons other than 
IQ. The only way IQ is relevant is in thinking about what kinds of reforms will 
or will not work." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray's conclusion that society's less fortunate do poorly on IQ tests will 
come as no surprise to those working in the field, poverty experts say. But 
advocates of the poor prefer to use euphemisms like "low-skilled" that suggest 
a person's abilities are not predetermined and can improve with outside 
guidance. 
</P>
<P>
 Gueron of the Manpower Demonstration Research Corp. accedes that job-training 
programs historically have mixed results. However, looking at the results of 
short-term interventions doesn't tell the full story, she adds. "A six-month 
training program is not the same thing as enrolling children in quality 
education for 12 years," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Murray and Herrnstein assert that their arguments are in the mainstream 
of social science, there remains in academia much disagreement about the use 
and effectiveness of IQ tests in measuring innate intelligence. Critics say the 
pair overstate the genetic component while ignoring or dismissing important 
environmental factors. These critics add that Herrnstein and Murray are on the 
shakiest empirical ground when they assert a genetic component in the 15-point 
IQ test difference between blacks and whites. They used that claim to criticize 
affirmative action in both education and hiring. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, including some religious conservatives, are unnerved by the pair's 
fixation with intelligence at the expense of other human traits. "We are 
created in the image of God, who doesn't make those kinds of distinctions," 
said Empower America's Wehner. "IQ doesn't measure character or perseverance or 
loyalty." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it was Murray who paved a moral high road for conservatives 
pushing welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 His first contribution was the 1984 book "Losing Ground," which portrayed poor 
single women who had babies and then collected welfare checks as citizens 
making rational decisions in the face of an irrational social welfare policy. 
That was followed last year by an influential Wall Street Journal opinion piece 
that gave conservatives cover on the race issue by arguing that welfare reform 
was not just about black unwed mothers: Welfare was fostering a growing white 
underclass as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The Iowa-born Murray, a Harvard graduate who insists he doesn't know his own 
IQ, spent the bulk of the 1960s in rural Thai villages, first helping the poor 
as a Peace Corps volunteer and later, as the Vietnam War heated up, conducting 
counterinsurgency research. He spent most of the 1970s studying the results of 
various social programs, particularly those aimed at criminal justice. 
</P>
<P>
 His writings in the past decade are infused with his own experiences in the 
Thai countryside, as well as those from his current home town, a rural hamlet 
nestled in Maryland's picturesque hills. Murray's bottom-line belief is that 
America could regain its moorings if government stepped aside and allowed 
natural social pressures -- the kind found in these small-town settings -- to 
mold its residents into upstanding and informed citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 On welfare, Murray has been able to push the bounds of respectable political 
debate. He and other like-minded thinkers encouraged conservatives to make the 
case that dismantling a welfare state that distorted incentives -- ultimately 
hurting the poor -- was a compassionate position. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberals, meanwhile, grew more comfortable discussing an out-of-wedlock 
birthrate that today hovers around 30%. Even President Clinton last year said 
he agreed with Murray's analysis that welfare played a role in the breakdown of 
the family, although he stressed that he disagreed with Murray's prescription 
to end welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about Murray's latest work at a press conference earlier this month, 
Clinton said: "I disagree with the proposition that there are inherent racially 
based differences in the capacity of the American people to reach their full 
potential. . . . It goes against our entire history and our whole tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to Murray's earlier writings, "The Bell Curve" takes a harsh view 
of the poor, asserting that their generally low cognitive abilities lead to, at 
best, short-sighted judgment calls and poor parenting and, at worst, to 
criminality. The authors' rhetoric about poor single mothers is particularly 
sharp. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greatest problems afflict children unlucky enough to be born to and 
reared by unmarried mothers who are below average in intelligence -- about 20% 
of children currently being born," Herrnstein and Murray write. "They tend to 
do badly, socially and economically. . . . Inadequate nutrition, physical 
abuse, emotional neglect, lack of intellectual stimulation, a chaotic home 
environment . . . are very difficult to improve from outside the home when the 
single mother is incompetent. Incompetent mothers are highly concentrated among 
the least intelligent, and their numbers are growing." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray says he wants his book to force policy-makers to take a more candid 
look at the limitations of social programs. "Let's be realistic," he said. 
"There has been a lot of wishful thinking that everyone can be trained for 
$18-an-hour jobs. We'd better start thinking hard about how to create 
satisfying lives" outside the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray supports returning social services to neighborhoods, where citizens can 
find fulfilling roles in life helping each other. He supports simplifying the 
criminal justice system -- with fixed and clearly stated punishments -- so that 
people with low mental abilities can follow a brightly lit "moral compass." And 
he favors shifting immigration law to emphasize competency rather than U.S. 
family connections in determining who can legally enter the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In a twist typical of this unpredictable conservative, Murray also asserts 
that the country needs to adopt more measures to prop up the value of the 
dead-end jobs that are left for the growing population of low-IQ poor. He cites 
the expansion of the earned income tax credit and a negative income tax -- both 
of which boost the incomes of the working poor -- as two options. "Some sort of 
redistribution is here to stay," he and Herrnstein write. 
</P>
<P>
 The media reaction to "The Bell Curve" has been overwhelmingly negative, with 
most editorialists denouncing the book as dangerous pseudoscience. The Wall 
Street Journal and the New York Times Book Review published positive reviews, 
but the New Republic experienced a near revolt among its staff over a decision 
to print a summary of the authors' arguments on race. The magazine's editors 
responded to the rebellion by surrounding the article with 17 short 
commentaries, nearly all of them trashing the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrnstein, who enjoyed a career as a prominent Harvard scholar despite the 
controversy surrounding his early 1970s work on IQ, died of cancer last summer. 
That leaves Murray alone to pick up the fragments of the political grenade he 
has tossed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Waking up to accusations in the paper every day that you're a racist loses 
its charm," he said caustically. "I'm surprised by the wall-to-wall 
vilification -- yes, that's the right word, vilification. The shrillness and 
hysteria are more marked than I would have thought. You have to give us some 
credit for good faith. I expected abusive phone calls. I expected hate mail. I 
did not expect so many people who present themselves as thoughtful 
intellectuals to knowingly misrepresent the book."

A LONG, BITTER WAIT FOR FREEDOM ENDS; COURTS: MAN IS RELEASED AFTER SERVING 16 
YEARS FOR MURDER HE AND OTHERS SAY HE DID NOT COMMIT. WITNESS RECANTED 7 YEARS 
AGO.

 Growing up in this farm belt town in the 1960s, Charles Tomlin had no patience 
for the Bible verses his mother laid out for him each day or the flagrant 
racism that she and other blacks of the Dust Bowl generation abided with a 
certain turn of the cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 He liked easy money, an impulse that earned him the nickname "Treetop" when 
his mother scolded him for thinking money grew on trees. And he liked white 
women, which led to a new name on the streets, "Sweet Daddy," and a 
never-forgotten threat from Bakersfield police. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't approve of me messing with white girls," he said. "One detective 
told me: 'I'm going to break you.' I said, 'To break me, you're going to have 
to kill me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 They might as well have killed him, he said, for he has lived a kind of death 
ever since. For 16 years, Tomlin, 42, has been locked up for a drug killing he 
and others insist he did not commit -- a first-degree murder conviction 
contrived, they say, by Bakersfield officers making good on their threat. 
</P>
<P>
 The last seven years have been especially bitter, for they have come after the 
state's one eyewitness -- whose testimony was the only evidence against Tomlin 
-- confessed to the court that she sent the wrong man to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 If he lost faith watching the best years of his life swallowed up by San 
Quentin and Soledad, his mother went about her thrice-weekly church routine in 
Bakersfield confident that the truth would emerge. "The devil is just busy," 
Quinolia Wells said. "So I talked to the Lord every day, all day." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, a Beverly Hills attorney who took her son's appeal on a hunch 
called her to say the long wait was over. A federal district judge in Fresno 
had reversed the conviction on orders from the appeals court, which found that 
the case against Tomlin had been prejudiced at his 1979 trial by his first 
attorney's failure to challenge the eyewitness's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4:45 p.m. Friday, Tomlin walked out of Soledad State Prison, a free man. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's windy and sunny -- and it's free," said Tomlin as he stood outside the 
prison looking at the mountains. He could not stop laughing. "My mom, my wife, 
my sister, my auntie . . . all here. I had to hold back the tears. You know, 
it's a man thing -- my lawyer cried for me." 
</P>
<P>
 He won't be coming home to Bakersfield to stay, at least not if his mother can 
help it. Although there are no plans to retry him, "the detective who set him 
up still works here," she said. "It's not safe for Charles." 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Les Vincent, who headed the Tomlin investigation, would not return 
repeated phone calls seeking comment. His superior, Sgt. Ed Bowen, praised the 
homicide investigator's ability to "enforce the law without prejudice." The 
prosecutor who evaluated the evidence and argued the case also declined to 
comment, citing his new job as a Superior Court judge. "I see no useful purpose 
in answering questions about a case long ago when I had a different role," said 
Judge Len McGillivray. 
</P>
<P>
 But from the first days of the police investigation -- when the eyewitness 
seemed to describe two different killers -- to a pretrial lineup that was later 
deemed illegal, the Tomlin case seemed a rush to judgment. Black leaders 
believe it stands as a glaring example of what they have been decrying for 
years, that Kern County condones a two-tier system of justice -- one for them 
and one for whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Racism still runs deep here, they say, a vestige of the Dust Bowl and the 
South. "This is a pretty hopeless place for black people," said the Rev. 
Ishmael Kimbrough of the People's Missionary Baptist Church, which Tomlin's 
mother attends. "We are isolated and insulated geographically, socially and 
politically. You do us in, there's not going to be any repercussions." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wells was one of the forgotten Okies, a black sharecropper's daughter lost in 
the tide of rural whites who migrated to the area in the 1930s and '40s. The 
Bakersfield that greeted her was no promised land but rather a new land crueler 
for the dreams it mocked. 
</P>
<P>
 A single mother, she heeded the old racial divide. When she graduated from the 
cotton fields, it was to work as a housekeeper for a well-to-do white family. 
She lived on the black side of town, worshiped at a black church and warned her 
four children -- Charles the oldest and only son -- not to cross the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember one Sunday Charles had his tie on and he told his mama he wasn't 
going to church," said Rodney Warren, a childhood friend. "She grabbed ahold of 
his tie and tore off all the buttons on his shirt. He put on a new one and went 
to church." 
</P>
<P>
 By his own account, Tomlin started selling marijuana at 14. He got kicked out 
of Bakersfield High School for beating up a white student who called him "the 
'N' word." He was sent to West High, where he was one of a handful of blacks -- 
and the only one bold enough to date attractive white girls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was dating Jeanette or Judy, one of them or maybe both at the same time," 
Tomlin recalled. "Lot of dudes didn't like it." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was expelled for good when he fought a white athlete who was 
picking on the class nerd. Tomlin graduated to heroin sales and grand theft and 
spent more than two years behind bars in separate convictions. Paroled at 25, 
he married Jeanette Pellerin, his old girlfriend at West High, and they moved 
in with her mother in a quiet neighborhood. Tomlin took a job stocking liquor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charles wasn't a coldblooded person," Kimbrough said. "His thing was money, 
sweet talk, con, smooth. He's what I call a debonair hustler. Murder is not his 
MO." 
</P>
<P>
 The murder at the heart of the Tomlin case was a back-alley killing the night 
of Dec. 7, 1978, and the take was nine pounds of marijuana then worth an 
estimated $5,200. The victim was Daniel Stewart, 25, a white drug dealer from 
nearby Oildale. The eyewitness was Stewart's girlfriend, Leticia Mendez, 24, 
who was sitting next to Stewart in a truck when the gunman shot him between the 
eyes and ran off with the dope. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendez told Detective Vincent that she got a decent look at the gunman even 
though it was dark and she was scared. He was a stocky black man, 5-foot-6 or 
5-foot-8, with a mustache and medium Afro. That description came nowhere near 
matching Tomlin. He was 6 feet tall and slim and his hair was the farthest 
thing from an Afro -- tumbling to his shoulders in a straight style. 
</P>
<P>
 What eventually set investigators on Tomlin's trail was the account of a black 
teen-ager who arranged the meeting between the gunman and Stewart that night. 
According to police, the youth was too frightened to name the killer but he 
wrote "Treetop" (Tomlin's nickname) on a piece of paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Distraught and under the influence of tranquilizers, Mendez then picked out 
Tomlin's photo from a series Vincent showed her. The next day, she identified 
Tomlin at a live lineup, which was later deemed unconstitutional because 
Tomlin's attorney, Thomas P. Daly, was not present. Vincent apparently 
neglected to inform Daly of the proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomlin was charged with first-degree murder even though the gun and the drugs 
were never found. None of the fingerprints lifted from Stewart's truck matched 
Tomlin's. He was not carrying a large amount of money at the time of his arrest 
and the killer's clothing failed to turn up in his wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Tomlin said, he did not believe the charge would stick, chalking it 
up to ill feelings between him and Vincent. When he was 16, he said, the 
detective had hauled him off to headquarters to ask about the car he was 
driving. Another time, Vincent warned him about dating white girls. "He told me 
to knock it off or else. A few years later, he tried to pin a robbery on me, 
but I happened to be in the joint at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Vincent has refused to comment on the case, there is no way to check 
Tomlin's allegation of a police vendetta. Kimbrough, for one, believes it to be 
so. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charles dating white women was very definitely a factor in his arrest," he 
said. "For many years now, Detective Vincent has had an averse relationship to 
the black community. . . . On the streets it was said that Vincent was going to 
get 'smart-assed Charles,' and he got him." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen, Vincent's superior officer, said he could find a number of black 
citizens who would vouch for Vincent as a fair and honest cop. But when asked 
to give a name or two, Bowen declined: "I wouldn't be interested in doing that. 
That would put us in a defensive mode. But his reputation in the black 
community would stand the test. Rest assured." 
</P>
<P>
 This much is clear. The day police came to arrest Tomlin, word was all over 
the streets that another black man named Tindle -- shorter and stockier, with a 
medium Afro and violent past -- was the real killer. McGillivray, the 
prosecutor at the time, said he checked out the tip but would not say what he 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the trial, police could not produce the "Treetop" note scribbled by the 
teen-ager -- the note that alerted police to Tomlin. Vincent said he had lost 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's case hinged on Mendez identifying Tomlin in court, and she did not 
disappoint. Daly tried to poke holes in her testimony by pointing out that she 
saw the gunman in the dark for no more than five minutes and that Tomlin looked 
nothing like the description she first gave police. 
</P>
<P>
 But just when he seemed to raise doubts about her identification, Daly made a 
grievous error by asking Mendez about her selection of Tomlin at the live 
lineup. Prosecutors were precluded from broaching the subject because the 
lineup was unconstitutional. But as soon as Daly raised it, they hammered away, 
confirming that Mendez had, in fact, selected Tomlin. Daly compounded his error 
by never eliciting information that the lineup was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomlin had plenty of alibis for that night. His wife testified that he drove 
her to work at the time the gunman reportedly called the victim to set up the 
drug buy. His mother-in-law testified that he was asleep in his bedroom at the 
time of the murder. This was confirmed by Jackie Smith, the self-described 
neighborhood busybody who lived next door. 
</P>
<P>
 "The car was in the driveway and Charles was asleep," Smith said. "I know 
because I went over there that night to sell Avon (products)." 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-man, five-woman jury, all white, found Tomlin guilty of first-degree 
murder and he was sentenced to 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and her husband, both white, would spend the next five years writing 
letters to the governor, newspapers, "60 Minutes" and "20/20." It nearly drove 
her mad, she said, that no one would believe her. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The more Mendez pondered her identification, the more it seemed she had made a 
terrible mistake. She sought the help of a psychologist and then an attorney 
friend, who told her she was suffering normal doubt. She moved twice, hoping to 
start a new life, but the gnawing images would not go away. 
</P>
<P>
 The detectives, she recalled, had flinched the first time she considered the 
photo of Tomlin, a tiny movement that she said intimated this was the killer. 
At the live lineup she expressed some doubt about Tomlin, and they responded 
that any doubt would kill the investigation right there. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you witness a murder, there is pressure to identify," she said. 
"Pressure from your family. Pressure from the police. And your own body puts 
you under a pressure to get it over quickly because you can't deal with it 
emotionally." 
</P>
<P>
 It is likely that Mendez never would have acted on her doubt if not for Gerson 
Horn, a Beverly Hills attorney with a weak spot for underdogs and ostrich-skin 
cowboy boots. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, a year after taking over Tomlin's appeal, Horn tracked down Mendez in 
the Bay Area with the help of a private eye. He had barely introduced himself, 
he said, when Mendez burst into tears and shouted, "I convicted an innocent 
man." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was unbelievable," Horn said. "Like out of some movie." 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing in Kern County, Mendez recanted her identification and Daly 
admitted that he was derelict in his defense of Tomlin. But Superior Court 
Judge Robert Baca was not moved. He found Mendez to be emotionally distraught 
and not believable and denied a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn refused to give up. He spent eight years exhausting state and federal 
appeals. Then two weeks ago he learned that a decision this summer by the U.S. 
9th Circuit Court of Appeals -- that Tomlin's rights had been compromised by 
the illegal lineup and incompetent defense -- was final. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the realization of a dream," Horn said, his voice breaking. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 On a late September afternoon, Charles Tomlin waited inside a 9-by-12-foot 
cell at Soledad for the paperwork that would set him free. It was clear that he 
had made his mark on this world. As he walked across the yard, past the 
weightlifters and joggers and handball players, even the Aryan Brothers with 
swastikas tattooed on their chests greeted him by the name "Tree." A prison 
guard attributed the respect to the time Tomlin had spent in prison and his 
ability to hold onto his pride and spirit. "He's about as high as one can climb 
on the prison ladder," the guard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomlin, the father of seven, said he did not want it this way, to be freed on 
a technicality. He swore that he had swallowed any anger long ago. "I generated 
the injustice into something positive. Into studies and computer classes and 
words in the dictionary." 
</P>
<P>
 His mother is not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of time," she said. "A lot of time."

PROP. 187 BACKERS COUNTING ON MESSAGE, NOT STRATEGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ and PATRICK J. McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For months, the California ballot measure known as Proposition 187 -- which 
has focused attention nationwide on the divisive issue of illegal immigration 
-- enjoyed runaway support in spite of an official campaign that is 
ill-financed, loosely organized and at times seemingly adrift. 
</P>
<P>
 Pro-187 forces, unable to hire a big-name consultant or mount an effective 
advertising effort, instead relied on Gov. Pete Wilson and others to carry 
their message on the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 In the critical days before the election, the movement's most colorful 
advocate is touring South Africa and its enigmatic, secretive chairman is so 
uncomfortable with the press that he flees from some journalists, refuses to 
talk to others and barely conceals his disdain for most of the rest. Initiative 
proponents are often unavailable for public forums or stay away to avoid 
hostile opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of such shortcomings, however, proponents have banked on The 
Message: the widely held perception that an "invasion" of illegal immigrants is 
causing economic hardship and eroding the lifestyles of U.S. citizens and 
authorized immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 This no-strategy strategy seemed destined to produce an extraordinary 
electoral success -- until now. Abruptly the scenario anti-187 activists have 
long predicted, that voter approval would fall as Election Day nears, appears 
to be coming to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest Los Angeles Times Poll shows that support for the initiative has 
dropped dramatically -- from a comfortable 26-point cushion earlier this month 
to a 10-point margin last week. The Field Poll records a parallel decline in 
approval rates for Proposition 187, which would bar illegal immigrants from 
receiving public school education and any of the limited publicly funded 
non-emergency health care programs they now qualify for, including 
immunizations and prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
 In another campaign, experts say, such a surge in opposition might prompt a 
brisk counter-response by advocates. A barrage of commercials would serve to 
reinforce the all-important central message, quell growing doubts and reassure 
the elderly and other core backers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now I would think they would need to recap what's going on, assess the 
damages, and see what direction they want to take the campaign," said Donna 
Lucas, a Sacramento-based political consultant. "They need to be going into the 
last two weeks with a proactive strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ron S. Prince, the Tustin accountant who is chairman of the pro-187 
forces, almost bristles at the suggestion of a tactical rethinking, stressing 
the "grass-roots" origins of an initiative placed on the ballot with more than 
600,000 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just going to keep on doing what we're doing, and then we'll all wait 
and see on Election Day how it works," Prince said in his characteristically 
hushed voice after a public meeting of pro-187 forces in a Garden Grove bank 
building last week. "We're down so close to the election that there really 
isn't a lot of time to worry." 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, the pro-187 campaign and its allies are switching gears, calling 
in volunteers, accelerating fund-raising efforts and hitting the airwaves. "For 
us to let up and coast to a victory is something we really don't know how to 
do," said Prince, who leaped from obscurity to become a kind of Howard Jarvis 
of the contentious immigration debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the slippage now evident in the polls will continue remains to be 
seen. Though a landslide now seems unlikely, the measure still appears destined 
for passage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather be in our shoes than in our opponents' shoes," said Alan C. 
Nelson, former U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service commissioner who is 
a co-author of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happens on Nov. 8, proponents have indisputably scored a tremendous 
success. Their ill-funded movement, born in suburban living rooms throughout 
California, has helped shift the terms of the nation's great debate on 
immigration, possibly for a generation or longer. And it has put pressure on 
the Clinton Administration to take action, including bolstering enforcement at 
the U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've already won," said Robert R. Kiley, the Yorba Linda-based consultant 
who is managing the campaign. "After this passes in November, it's going from 
state to state to state." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite backers' clear accomplishments and still-comfortable lead in the 
polls, voter surveys show that opponents' aggressive campaign tactics have 
managed to engender the kernel of doubt essential for any "No" campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally speaking, if you give someone a reason to vote 'no' on something 
they'll do it," said Arnold Steinberg, a political strategist who usually works 
with Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a fact not lost on the measure's supporters. With barely a week left 
until Election Day, the California Republican Party -- already a major 
financial contributor -- is touting Proposition 187 with 2 million 
"door-hangers," urging residents to vote "yes," as well as in slate mailers 
addressed to targeted households. GOP volunteers are also working the 
telephones to help overcome the fund-raising lag. 
</P>
<P>
 On the media front, Wilson -- who has made Proposition 187 a mainstay of his 
reelection campaign -- began airing two new television commercials last week 
reaffirming his support. This week, a series of pro-187 radio spots is 
scheduled to hit the airwaves statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 The ads, analysts agree, will help. But, already trailing in fund-raising by 
almost 3 to 1, pro-187 forces acknowledge that a shortage of cash is making it 
increasingly difficult to disseminate their message -- just as the other side 
has bolstered its campaign against the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very frustrating," said Barbara A. Coe, who heads the California 
Coalition for Immigration Reform. The Huntington Beach-based umbrella 
organization is a co-sponsor of Proposition 187 and is among those bankrolling 
the radio campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the official initiative committee is lagging in fund raising, assists 
from Wilson and other allies have provided a considerable boost, giving the 
measure much more exposure than the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign recently solicited contributions from hundreds of supporters who 
previously donated an average of $23. On Friday, supporters held their first 
major fund-raiser at an Anaheim eatery. Along with generating much-needed cash, 
the $20-per-person event was also designed to attract media attention to the 
pro-187 effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking out journalists is a novel step for a campaign unusually wary about 
the press. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Prince himself once fled from reporters and has refused to speak to 
several whose articles he disliked. Organizers were so outraged when the Orange 
County Register recently printed the address of the pro-187 campaign 
headquarters -- along with a photograph of the building -- that supporters 
accused the newspaper of endangering lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "All they omitted was a map and a loaded .45 handgun!" the California 
Coalition for Immigration Reform declared in its newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally routine press etiquette -- such as returning reporters' telephone 
messages and providing information packets -- has proved problematic for the 
pro-187 leadership, making it more difficult for journalists to report 
advocates' viewpoints. By contrast, the comparatively well-financed opposition 
has eagerly courted the media. 
</P>
<P>
 At the pro-187 session in Garden Grove last week, a pervasive dread of the 
press prevailed. Speakers and members of the audience alike spoke of the 
"liberal media" being engaged in an orchestrated "smear" campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond what they perceive as biased news accounts, many are outraged about 
attempts by anti-proposition forces to confront and shout down 187 
representatives and link the measure to a New York foundation that critics call 
white supremacist. The allegation is heatedly denied by the foundation and 
assailed by proposition backers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only is the opposition better financed, but they're ruthless, and they've 
tried to shut people up," said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach), who 
spoke at the meeting here and has made a name for himself as a hard-liner on 
illegal immigration. "I think people are being confused by this incredible 
propaganda barrage that is being unleashed on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlawful immigrants, Rohrabacher told the audience, represent the 
"liberal/left foot soldiers in the next decade." 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd of 100 or so who came to listen to an array of pro-187 pitches 
provides a window of sorts into the core support for Proposition 187. 
Participants were overwhelmingly white suburbanites, including many elderly. 
Most of them are clearly troubled by population shifts that, they said, have 
rapidly transformed their once-familiar communities into strange and dangerous 
places where English is heard less and less. Illegal immigration is to blame, 
they all agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are becoming a Third World state," said Robert Lacey, a computer executive 
who traveled from Riverside County to attend. Many of his neighbors have opted 
to leave California, he noted, adding that his home's value had plummeted and 
his wife had found it difficult to find work because she could not speak 
Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Expressing skepticism about the latest poll results, proponents theorize that 
respondents are hesitant to show their real feelings about the volatile issue 
and may be deliberately misleading pollsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Supporters are going underground, declining to state their intention," said 
Barbara Kiley, the mayor of Yorba Linda and state co-chairwoman of Proposition 
187. (She is also the wife of Robert Kiley, the campaign consultant.) "They get 
intimidated." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet outside consultants who watch the polls closely say pro-187 organizers can 
blame themselves in part for the measure's apparent nose-dive in popularity, 
faulting a contradictory campaign strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 In attempting to counter near-apocalyptic charges that the passage of 
Proposition 187 will spread disease and crime, Wilson and other adherents have 
themselves downplayed short-term impacts should the measure pass. The proposal 
to ban illegal immigrants from public schools and other major provisions will 
inevitably face court challenges that will delay implementation for years, they 
stress. 
</P>
<P>
 "As much as I'd like to see services to the undocumented stopped immediately," 
Barbara Kiley said, "I don't believe that's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Although reassuring to some, such statements inevitably dilute the point, 
observers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a weak message," said Allan Hoffenblum, a Los Angeles Republican 
political consultant. "They need something stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 Also narrowing Proposition 187's once-commanding lead, observers agree, is the 
broadening base of opposition. Recent denunciations by Jack F. Kemp and William 
J. Bennett, both prominent Republicans, may have provided conservatives and 
moderates in both parties with right-wing "cover" for their opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 A general lack of cohesion within the pro-187 camp is testament to the 
unwieldy nature of the campaign, which was born in neighborhood meetings and 
quickly mushroomed into a loose-knit, statewide coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, members in different regions and positions have varying agendas and 
largely call their own shots. 
</P>
<P>
 One major faction consists of a group of seasoned political veterans headed by 
two proposition co-authors: ex-immigration commissioner Nelson and his former 
West Coast lieutenant, Harold W. Ezell. The pair broke away from the principal 
group this year to form Americans Against Illegal Immigration, which is 
focusing on the fight at the national level. 
</P>
<P>
 The central "Save Our State" campaign committee is composed of a separate, 
less experienced nucleus of supporters led by Prince. His two state 
co-chairpersons are Yorba Linda Mayor Kiley and Assemblyman Richard L. Mountjoy 
(R-Arcadia). A group of Bay Area supporters directs the Northern California 
front. 
</P>
<P>
 Although united by the cause, the coalition has splintered on personality 
issues, most notably between Prince and Ezell, two men with vastly different 
styles. Prince's reticent, press-shy comportment stands in stark contrast to 
the hail-fellow-well-met demeanor of the gregarious Ezell, who has been known 
to return reporters' calls from the other side of the world, even about stories 
critical of his often-provocative behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Initiative backers have turned down some requests for appearances, Prince 
acknowledged, citing a limited number of volunteers to participate. And some 
sponsors seemed biased, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The pro-187 committee is also avoiding forums "where there are combative 
situations," noted Kiley, the campaign consultant. "We don't want to put our 
people in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
 Such selective appearances, observers said, reflect a strategy based on a 
belief in the inevitability of victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pro side didn't really have a strategy," said Steinberg, the political 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pro side took passage as fait accompli. " 
</P>
<P>
 Although proposition organizers have endeavored to keep their public focus on 
illegal immigration, the lack of cohesiveness among pro-187 forces has 
sometimes led to mixed messages between Prince's measured pronouncements and 
the more incendiary rhetoric from his allies in a movement that has clearly 
tapped into a popular vein of discontent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Multiculturalism" is the favored target of Ruth Coffey, a pro-187 activist 
who runs Stop Immigration Now -- a member organization of the California 
Coalition for Immigration Reform, the initiative co-sponsor -- from her 
cluttered Long Beach apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no intention of being the object of 'conquest,' peaceful or otherwise, 
by Latinos, Asians, blacks, Arabs or any other group of individuals who have 
claimed my country," Coffey wrote recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Another outspoken Proposition 187 supporter, Glenn Spencer, who heads a 
Sherman Oaks-based group called the Voice of Citizens Together, has 
characterized illegal immigration as "part of a reconquest of the American 
Southwest by foreign Hispanics." 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer added: 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone is going to be leaving the state. It will either be them or us."

RIORDAN SET TO BACK FEINSTEIN IN SENATE RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a major boost for her campaign, Sen. Dianne Feinstein is expected to 
receive an endorsement today from Republican mayor Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's campaign issued a statement Saturday afternoon forecasting a 
"major endorsement" today at 11:30 a.m. in Studio City. Riordan's office 
declined to comment Saturday but Feinstein supporters confirmed the 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a Republican, probably next to the governor, the most prominent 
Republican in the state of California," said one Feinstein backer, who asked 
not to be identified. "It sends a signal that very important Republicans, who 
don't often do this, are looking at this race in a very thoughtful way and 
saying this city and this state need Dianne Feinstein." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan joins a long list of prominent GOP officials who have turned their 
backs on GOP nominee Mike Huffington and announced their support for the 
Democratic incumbent, most of whom opposed her last campaign in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The list includes former baseball commissioner and 1984 Olympics chief Peter 
V. Ueberroth and Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Feinstein has also scheduled a news conference to announce 
endorsements from the heads of five of the nation's top defense firms -- 
Northrop, Douglas Aircraft, Rockwell, TRW and Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's campaign was sharply critical of Riordan's decision, comparing it 
to Republican New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's endorsement of Democratic 
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dick Riordan and Rudy Giuliani can go start their own party because they 
clearly don't belong in the GOP," said spokeswoman Jennifer Grossman. 
"Riordan's Republican loyalties run only skin-deep. He has a long history of 
donating huge amounts of money to candidates of both parties to ensure he has 
political access after Election Day. This time, he's picked the wrong horse. He 
hopes Feinstein will feed him pork from Washington, but he'll be stuck lobbying 
a retired Mrs. Feinstein out of San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
 The Riordan endorsement is particularly helpful to Feinstein because her 
toughest battle is in Southern California. Polls show Feinstein holds a thin 
lead in the Senate race statewide, but most of her support is in the north 
where she is better known as the former mayor of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein and Riordan have worked closely together this year on gaining 
disaster aid for the fires and the earthquake that devastated parts of the 
city. Riordan also went to Washington this year to help lobby for the crime 
bill and the assault weapons ban that Feinstein authored. 
</P>
<P>
 When the crime bill narrowly passed, Riordan appeared with Feinstein to 
announce how much money and additional police might be generated for the city. 
Huffington officials were critical of Riordan for making the appearance.

ON CALIFORNIA: THE WEEK IN REVIEW, PANT PANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Remember that long-ago time -- about the middle of last month -- when 
California politicians kept whining and moaning about competition from the O.J. 
Simpson case? The fear was that Californians would be so fixated on bloody 
gloves and 911 calls there'd be no brain room left for politics. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat this posed to the Bear Republic was almost unthinkable. Imagine 
citizens going to the polls without having paid close attention to those great 
instruments of modern democracy -- political television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 After the last week of political theater, the question of whether campaigns 
can compete with the Simpson whodunit seems to have been put to rest. Judge 
Lance A. Ito should take a vacation until after the election. This was a week 
that brought, among other items, Senate candidate Mike Huffington's amazing Zoe 
Baird problem, and a commercial that seemed to implicate Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren 
in the murder of Polly Klaas, and a suggestion from the governor, quickly 
retracted, that in post-Proposition 187 California all citizens will be 
required to carry identification cards. 
</P>
<P>
 For the politicos, it was a week of white knuckles and increasingly shrill 
name-calling and campaign themes rewritten on the fly, of strategies overtaken 
by events. Everything was moving fast. Polls seemed outdated almost upon 
release. Some notes on the weirdness: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 First, to the Huff. He began the week ready to rally voters around his fresh 
endorsement of Proposition 187. He ended it admitting that he and his wife had 
kept an undocumented worker on their domestic staff. To be fair, Huffington 
made it clear he did not hire the baby-sitter. He said his wife did it. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Huffington was big about it all: "As the head of my household, the buck 
stops with me." At their public confession, the Huffingtons came across as 
almost sympathetic figures before the cameras, especially when Arianna 
Huffington spoke of Marisela, the baby-sitter in question: "You cannot buy love 
for your children, and Marisela loves them to this day." 
</P>
<P>
 My guess is that their baby-sitting dilemma would have been forgiven and 
quickly forgotten by most card-carrying Californians -- but for the rhetoric 
Huffington had brought days earlier to his endorsement of Proposition 187: "The 
hostility of this state toward illegal immigration," he had said, "has risen in 
direct proportion to the weakness of our political leaders to enforce 
immigration laws already on the books." 
</P>
<P>
 He said this, it's now clear, knowing full well that an illegal immigrant had 
baby-sat his children for five years. One wonders what he'll talk about in the 
remaining campaign days. Personal integrity? Leadership by example? The 
weather? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A new campaign commercial aired last week, and in a season in which the venom 
in political spots has become almost comic, a burlesque of deep voices and wild 
accusations, this one established a new standard for outrageousness. It shows 
an old man, with flowers, at the grave of a girl. 
</P>
<P>
 The old man is Joe Klaas. He is the grandfather of Polly Klass, the Petaluma 
12-year-old whose abduction and murder by a paroled kidnaper galvanized the 
movement for a "three strikes" law. The ad was produced by the campaign of Tom 
Umberg, who is running for attorney general. It attempts to make the point that 
Polly might be alive today if the incumbent, Dan Lungren, had not cut funds for 
a statewide computer program. The details behind the allegation are 
complicated, disputed and, on the whole, irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 To suggest, as the ad clearly does, that the blood of Polly Klaas is on the 
hands of Dan Lungren is, as the attorney general said Friday in Santa Rosa, 
"absolutely abhorrent," and "despicable," and "the lowest, lowest campaign 
tactic ever" and "disgusting." 
</P>
<P>
 But he understates the point. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Wilson's staff spent the latter part of the week putting out a big fire. 
The San Francisco Chronicle had asked the governor if, should Proposition 187 
pass, all Californians would be required to carry a card to prove they are 
legal residents. After a lengthy preamble, the governor answered "yes." 
</P>
<P>
 The subsequent story caused instant discomfort among those who consider such a 
card as basically un-American. Comparisons were made to the yellow armbands of 
Nazi Germany. Myself, I recalled all the times I had lost my laminated gym card 
over the years. Of course, my skin is not brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, the governor's firefighters moved fast the next day to extinguish the 
controversy. The governor, a spokesman spoke, "did not, is not and has never 
proposed -- nor does he envision -- that all Californians must 'carry' a new 
identification card if Proposition 187 passes." 
</P>
<P>
 Interesting, the word all in that denial, no?

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / CONGRESS; DEMOCRATS DOWNPLAYING TIES TO CLINTON; 
VULNERABLE INCUMBENTS STRESS THEIR INDEPENDENCE AS GOP SEEKS TO EXPLOIT 
PRESIDENT'S DROP IN POPULARITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Richard H. Lehman, a conservative Democrat from the San Joaquin Valley, 
admires President Clinton and thinks he is doing some good things for America. 
</P>
<P>
 But the only reference to Clinton in Lehman's television commercials as he 
fights for reelection is not one likely to get him invited to the White House 
for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Lehman, seeking a seventh term, is trying to distance himself politically from 
Clinton, and he is not alone among Democratic incumbents scrambling to survive 
what Republicans hope will be a GOP landslide nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Democratic congressmen from California who find themselves in tight 
races with Republican challengers are eager to shed their connection to the 
President, who carried California handily in 1992 but has since seen his 
popularity drop by about 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensing a chance to narrow the Democrats' 30-22 edge in the state's 
congressional delegation, the Republicans are determined not to let the 
Democrats edge away from Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 A Republican TV commercial in use across the nation for weeks begins with a 
picture of Clinton that "morphs" into a picture of the local Democratic 
incumbent. Last week, the Republicans unveiled three more anti-Clinton 
commercials, including one that advises voters to "send Clinton's Congress 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 To counteract this strategy, Lehman reminds voters in his TV commercial of his 
bitter fight with the Clinton Administration over water, a life-and-death issue 
in the California farm belt: 
</P>
<P>
 "This year Washington threatened to shut off federal irrigation water unless 
valley growers surrendered to outrageous demands. Raised on a valley farm, Rick 
Lehman fought the federal threats all the way to the White House. Washington 
backed down, and our farmers kept their water . . . Rick Lehman, independent, 
like the valley."  
</P>
<P>
 The commercial then displays a headline from the Fresno Bee: "Lehman Vows 
Clinton Will Pay." 
</P>
<P>
 Lehman and other incumbents are hoping their familiarity with voters and their 
fund-raising advantage will help repel the Republican challenge and the 
anti-incumbent mood of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Democrats are deriding the GOP's "Contract With America" as 
proof that the wanna-be congressmen are more interested in ideological purity 
than in serving their districts. And Clinton is enjoying a slight uptick in the 
polls because of his foreign policy successes. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, those factors have not translated into a willingness by embattled 
Democratic incumbents to embrace their President. When Clinton came to the San 
Francisco Bay Area a week ago only two San Mateo County congressmen, both with 
easy reelection races, came to greet him. 
</P>
<P>
 The need to assert independence from Clinton is particularly keen among three 
first-termers from California who are seen as vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Dan Hamburg, a liberal Democrat from Mendocino County, jumps at the 
chance to tell audiences of his deep philosophical differences with Clinton 
over trade policies, Somalia, health care and relations with China. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamburg feels close to Clinton as part of the same generation of politicians 
who were college protesters against the Vietnam War. He says that Clinton is 
bravely tackling issues ignored by the Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hamburg has no plans to distribute a campaign brochure that he had used in 
the primary displaying side-by-side pictures of him and the President, a 
brochure with the headline, "We're Starting to Make Government Work for Your 
Family." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Lynn Schenk, a "business-oriented" Democrat from San Diego, has a TV 
commercial saying she "stood up" to the President to vote for a balanced budget 
amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills) makes the same pitch during speeches, as 
well as emphasizing that she favored even deeper budget cuts than the 
President. "I have not been afraid to take on the Clinton Administration," she 
tells audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 So insistent is the anti-Clinton rhetoric in some races that even some veteran 
Democratic incumbents are becoming exasperated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear our Republican opponent would rather run against Bill Clinton than 
against us," said Craig Miller, campaign manager for nine-term Rep. Anthony C. 
Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills). "But it's not going to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony Beilenson has a very close relationship with the voters of his district, 
and the voters know there is a big difference between President Clinton and 
congressman Beilenson." 
</P>
<P>
 Schenk says that if her Republican opponent, Brian Bilbray, "wants to run 
against Bill Clinton so badly, let him sign up for the 1996 presidential 
primary." 
</P>
<P>
 Bilbray, a San Diego County supervisor, has mockingly offered to pay Clinton's 
air fare to San Diego so he can campaign for Schenk. 
</P>
<P>
 Lehman's opponent, former Mariposa County Supervisor George Radanovich, went a 
step further. He held a news conference flanked by a life-size cardboard cutout 
of Clinton and offered to pay both air fare and motel bill if Clinton would 
come to Fresno to campaign for Lehman. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Vic Fazio (D-West Sacramento), an eight-term member and chairman of the 
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, downplays the political 
significance of incumbents edging away from the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Fazio calls it "standard fare" and just a reaffirmation of the fact that the 
Democratic Party allows a great deal of internal disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing wrong with the fact that Dan Hamburg disagrees with the 
President on NAFTA, or Rick Lehman disagrees on water, or Lynn Schenk likes a 
balanced budget amendment of a different sort than the President," Fazio said. 
"Disagreement is not the same as repudiation." 
</P>
<P>
 So buoyed are Republicans by Clinton's overall slippage in the polls that the 
party is hoping to defeat one or more of four longtime Democratic incumbents in 
California: Beilenson, Fazio, Lehman and Rep. George E. Brown Jr. of Colton. 
</P>
<P>
 If the GOP succeeds in dethroning some of the four veteran incumbents or three 
first-termers "targeted" in California, it would be a turnaround from November, 
1992, when only one congressman in the state was defeated for reelection: Frank 
Riggs, a Republican, defeated by Hamburg. This year, Riggs is hoping for 
revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 There are potential bright spots for the Democrats, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Fazio believes that Democrats can pick up open congressional seats formerly 
held by Republicans in Santa Barbara and eastern Riverside County and a 
Riverside seat now held by Republican Ken Calvert, who was caught with a 
prostitute last winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Fazio's first priority, of course, is his own reelection. In a briefing for 
local reporters on issues important to Yolo County, Fazio talked for an hour 
about transportation, the environment, student loans and federal subsidies for 
housing at UC Davis. The name Bill Clinton did not pass his lips. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican leaders are delighting in the Democrats' discomfiture. The party 
needs to pick up 40 seats nationwide to give control of the House of 
Representatives to the GOP for the first time in four decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Democrats are running away from their own President," said Jeannie 
Austin, co-chair of the Republican National Committee. "What kind of political 
party is that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats are sensitive about allegations of running away from Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are neither running away from the President nor running toward him," said 
Miller of the Beilenson campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fresno, Radanovich, 39, is branding Lehman a Clinton clone, reminding 
voters of how often Lehman has supported the Administration, and hurling the 
epithet "career politician." 
</P>
<P>
 At age 48, Lehman has been in politics his entire adult life: as a legislative 
aide, an assemblyman and then congressman from a "safe" Democratic district. 
But redistricting two years ago left him a district that is only marginally 
Democratic, and in 1992 he barely defeated a political novice. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other Republican challengers, Radanovich cannot use the 1993 budget 
bill that boosted taxes for upper-income Americans against the incumbent. 
Lehman voted against the bill, despite two phone calls from Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 After his no vote, the White House withdrew an invitation for Lehman to go 
backpacking with Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt in King's Canyon 
National Park, which is in Lehman's district. 
</P>
<P>
 As the election nears, Lehman, an avid backpacker, counts that snub as one of 
the best things that ever happened to him.

SCHOOL CASTS NEW LIGHT ON LEARNING; EDUCATION: SOME STUDENTS FIND THAT WITH 
FEWER SOCIAL PRESSURES THEY CAN FOCUS MORE ON THEIR STUDIES AT WASHINGTON 
STATE'S ONLY EVENING HIGH SCHOOL, THE MODEL FOR A SIMILAR GLENDALE PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dusk falls slowly near the southern tip of Puget Sound. But the 230 students 
of New Century High seem hardly to notice as they sit through lessons well into 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
 At the only evening high school in Washington state, classes begin at 2:30 
p.m. and end at 8:40 p.m. And students like it that way -- from the aspiring 
obstetrician who wakes before dawn to go to work to the longhaired Led Zeppelin 
fan who sleeps until afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 What binds them is a need for a small learning environment that enables them 
to know all their teachers and schoolmates, and a strong dislike of the social 
pressures that pervade traditional high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids just seem to blossom there," said Paula Gilpin, whose daughter is a 
sophomore. "It's mainly for the middle-of-the-road kids who are not failures 
and not hotshots. It's mainly for the middle-of-the-road kids who suddenly come 
into their own. There's not all the pressure from cheerleaders, football 
players, hoodlums and all." 
</P>
<P>
 Respected within educational circles for its success in motivating students, 
New Century is the model the Glendale Unified School District has selected as 
it develops its own evening high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale trustees voted in July to become the first California public school 
system to provide comprehensive classes next fall for regular high school 
students in the late afternoon and evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping campuses open longer is one way for financially strapped districts 
like Glendale's to ease overcrowding and curb dropout rates, while saving money 
and avoiding unpopular year-round class schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in Washington state -- including parents, teachers and the state 
superintendent of public instruction -- say certain teen-agers benefit 
tremendously from nighttime instruction, staying in school when they might 
otherwise drop out. 
</P>
<P>
 But after five years, support for New Century is far from universal. Teachers 
and administrators at other campuses believe that the institution drains 
resources away from their schools. Friction abounds between the staffs -- and 
students -- of the two schools that share, day and night, the same specially 
designed campus. Critics claim New Century has become elitist. 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulties have been exacerbated by tight finances. A proposed tax 
increase for teachers' salaries, classroom supplies and extracurricular 
activities failed in February and April, triggering more than 100 layoffs in 
the district. If voters reject the tax increase again early next year, closure 
of one of the daytime high schools, and possibly New Century, will follow, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But few in this bedroom community of 24,280 near the state capital of Olympia 
deny that evening high schools in general are a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Most New Century students say they adjust well by doing homework before or 
after school, and spending more time with friends and family on the weekend. 
One in four finishes work before school begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Student body President Valerie Reid said she was once an out-of-control 
hoodlum who first smoked pot at the age of 7 and enjoyed beating up strangers 
as a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old California native enrolled at New Century after her father 
walked into the wrong school office. He came out sold on the idea of an evening 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was logical," Reid says now. "I learned more at night because it was my 
prime time. . . . It was not like I hated school. At the time, it was like I 
had bigger and better things I could be doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow senior Aurora Laing dreams of becoming an obstetrician and wakes before 
dawn each day to work as a courtesy clerk at Safeway for up to five hours. 
Then, she returns home to do homework before going to classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bubbly and serious at once, Laing is neither the homecoming queen type nor the 
class nerd, the kind of girl who admits she rarely got noticed by peers. "I 
have nothing against anybody, but I guess I never fit in," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only after she broke down in tears did Laing persuade her father, John, that 
she might blend in at New Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "Originally I thought of it as a dropout school, as an alternative high 
school," he said. "I thought it was for kids with names like Bubba or Killer, 
street-type slang names. . . . But it's for kids who don't want to be bothered 
with all the socializing." 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by miles of evergreens, the 40-acre campus opened last year. It was 
specially built to accommodate two different high schools in much the same 
space. There are two sets of administrative offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools are a study in contrasts. Only in passing do students from either 
school acknowledge one another, and derisive remarks are often traded. In the 
39 minutes it takes for the daytime students to leave the grounds before New 
Century opens, it is clear that the gulf between them is wide. 
</P>
<P>
 "They keep to themselves and we keep to ourselves, and if they have anything 
to say to us, we ignore 'em," said Todd Porter, a New Century senior and 
self-described cowboy fond of wearing Stetsons. 
</P>
<P>
 At River Ridge, the daytime high school that shares facilities with New 
Century, rap, hip-hop and R & B rule -- baggy pants and sports jackets are in 
vogue. For many, popularity can be measured by how many varsity sports you 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 New Century's dress code is come-as-you-are, no one really cares. While most 
students look like typical teen-agers, others resemble a blast from the past 
with long, unkempt hair, tie-dye shirts and sandals. The closest many ever get 
to physical exercise is playing intramural sports in street clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 The student councils of both schools have met regularly, but efforts to bring 
other students together have failed. "We've talked about having a joint school 
dance," said Georgia Cutburth, a co-director for River Ridge, "but our kids 
like hip-hop and rap and theirs like the moshing pits" used by slam dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some River Ridge students mercilessly use words such as geeks, freaks and 
losers to describe their nighttime counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our students sometimes experience discrimination for being who they 
are: individuals," said New Century's principal, Gail Covington-McBride. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though there are some detractors out there, within this environment it 
doesn't touch our students," she said. "Students find acceptance here among 
their peers. Does it hurt me when people say derogatory things about our 
students? Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
 McBride boasts that 64% of her students eventually go on to college. And the 
school's average scores on standardized tests rank just above the district 
average, though some say that is because the sample is taken from a smaller 
student population. 
</P>
<P>
 Its sister school is five times larger than New Century, with about 1,200 
students and the district's highest minority population, 31%. New Century has 
the fewest minorities, less than 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers say they joined New Century for the intimate learning atmosphere, 
though the student-teacher ratio is about the same as elsewhere in the 
district: 24 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 When the program was first conceived, Supt. David Steele said, the district 
suffered from overcrowding and was struggling to find ways of serving students 
with late-night jobs who often dropped out. Not enough room was left for 
portable classrooms on high school campuses, and year-round schooling was not a 
popular option, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want this for kids in trouble. We looked very seriously at these 
bright kids who didn't fit into a traditional schedule," Steele said. 
</P>
<P>
 The superintendent said his 13,000-student district should have avoided 
creating a single campus shared by two high schools with separate identities, 
principals and staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Glendale needs to look very carefully at, rather than having two distinct 
schools on one campus, how to use a campus for a longer period of time," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The faculties "fought all the time," Steele said. " 'Who's using the room? Why 
are you invading my space? Someone's using my stuff.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For parents, the biggest concern was whether students would be safe at school 
and in the neighborhood at night -- a worry similarly shared in Glendale, where 
the school system is more than twice as large. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has been the classroom success that has won high praise from state 
officials and a Blue Ribbon Award from the U.S. Department of Education last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things we've begun to recognize is that all students don't learn 
the same way," said the Washington state superintendent of public schools, 
Judith Billings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact I'm looking at in this case is there are a lot of students who would 
have otherwise opted not to go to school and are staying in school," she said. 
"There is a commitment to learning here that is probably greater than what you 
would find in a regular high school setting."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; SPOILING TO BE A SPOILER; LIKE OTHER MINOR PARTY 
GUBERNATORIAL HOPEFULS, LIBERTARIAN RICHARD RIDER SAYS A VOTE FOR HIM WILL SEND 
THE BIG GUYS -- IN HIS CASE, THE GOP -- A MESSAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Rider would love to have Gov. Pete Wilson's job. He dreams of hacking 
away at bureaucracy, crushing all new tax legislation under a huge rubber stamp 
that reads "VETO." He's even imagined the sound this would make: whoooomp!  
</P>
<P>
 Rider, the Libertarian candidate for governor, is a realist, however. The 
49-year-old stockbroker from San Diego knows that a minor party candidate such 
as himself has no hope of being elected governor Nov. 8. Still, he thinks he 
can help defeat Wilson (whom Rider deems a "wimp" and a "Benedict Arnold" 
masquerading as a Republican), which is why, not long ago, he wrote Democrat 
Kathleen Brown a letter asking for $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the Libertarian Party gubernatorial candidate. Normally that might elicit 
nothing more from you than a yawn. But I can get you elected," Rider wrote. 
"What you need is a third candidate to drain votes from Wilson. I can do that. 
. . . Dollar for dollar, there is no better use for your campaign funds than in 
my race for governor." 
</P>
<P>
 Rider's pitch must have sounded presumptuous coming from a man unknown to most 
Californians. Like the other minor party candidates for governor -- Jerome 
McCready of the American Independent Party and Gloria La Riva of the Peace & 
Freedom Party -- Rider was not invited to participate in the recent televised 
debate between Wilson and Brown. He lacks money, exposure and governmental 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rider has one very powerful thing going for him: a dissatisfied 
electorate. A recent Times poll shows that California voters are unhappy with 
Brown and Wilson and that three out of every five are planning to vote for the 
"lesser of two evils" for governor. If just a tiny fraction of those people 
vote for a so-called third party candidate, political analysts say, it could 
alter the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this state, where elections are won or lost by 1 or 2 points, third party 
candidates can decide elections," said Bill Press, chairman of the California 
Democratic Party, who has followed Rider's candidacy with interest. "If I had 
an extra $500,000, I would give it to Richard Rider and it would be money well 
spent. . . . Every vote he gets is one vote Pete Wilson doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Taken together, the four minor parties that have qualified to appear on the 
California ballot -- American Independent, Green, Libertarian, and Peace & 
Freedom -- represent 456,000 voters, or about 3% of the state's electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Independent and Libertarian parties, though they differ on many 
principles, are both committed to strictly limiting the power of government and 
to cutting taxes. Conventional wisdom says that to vote for one of these 
parties' candidates is to take a vote away from a Republican candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Green and the Peace & Freedom parties, though also very different from one 
another, both seek social justice and equality. These parties are more likely 
to appeal to voters who might otherwise cast ballots for Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 These minor parties' candidates face an uphill battle. Virtually ignored by 
the press and by their more mainstream rivals, they have trouble raising the 
money needed for expensive broadcast advertising and direct mail flyers. As a 
result, minor party candidates can campaign tirelessly, making speeches and 
walking precincts, and still remain largely unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 La Riva, the Peace & Freedom candidate for governor, is a printer and labor 
organizer in San Francisco. McCready, the American Independent nominee, runs a 
shop that sells pre-hung doors and other construction materials in Castroville. 
Rider, who closed his financial planning business at the end of last year, is 
the only minor party candidate who has campaigned for governor full time. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Press, the Democratic Party chairman, believes that politicians 
who ignore these alternative candidates do so at their own peril. This year, he 
has gone so far as to donate his own money to keep a Green Party gubernatorial 
candidate from competing with Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading up to the June primary election, three candidates were vying for the 
Green gubernatorial nomination -- despite widespread concern within the party 
that a Green nominee would siphon votes from Brown in the general election. 
Then, one Green leader launched a campaign urging Greens to vote for "None of 
the Above" -- an option that allows Greens to choose no candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to safeguard Brown voters, Press sent a $500 donation to the 
none-of-the-above campaign, dubbed Friends of Nobody. Then he sent letters to 
his friends asking them to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "I raised $5,000 to $6,000 or more for their campaign," Press said proudly, 
recalling that the effort to gain more votes for no one than for any of the 
candidates was successful. "Nobody won. Which I considered a victory." 
</P>
<P>
 Third party candidates are familiar with this kind of circular reasoning. They 
see no shame in losing, as long as they have introduced new ideas into the 
race. And they believe that every vote cast for a minor party candidate puts a 
little more pressure on the major parties to shape up. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why a conservative such as Rider is working so hard to help a Democrat 
such as Brown. Rider is probably the only Brown supporter who wants to do away 
with state income taxes, abolish the workers' compensation system and phase out 
all welfare payments. He wants to repeal the law that requires motorcyclists to 
wear helmets. He believes the Endangered Species Act will result in the 
nationalization of all property. And he supports the death penalty -- which 
Brown opposes, though she pledges to enforce it as governor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, I'm no fan of the Democrats' pipe dream of a socialist utopia. . . 
. Kathleen Brown would make a terrible governor," Rider said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown would do less damage than Wilson, Rider added, and a Brown victory 
would send a clear signal to the GOP. If he could do that, Rider said, he would 
feel like a winner no matter how badly he lost. 
</P>
<P>
 And, he said, Wilson is not a true Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brown is a very ineffective Democrat. Wilson is a very effective Democrat. 
It's time the Republican Party stopped running stealth Democrats for governor," 
Rider said. "If I pull enough conservative votes to cause Wilson to lose, then 
Republicans will have to start running real limited-government candidates such 
as Ron Unz." 
</P>
<P>
 Rider is a big fan of Unz, the 32-year-old Silicon Valley entrepreneur who 
challenged Wilson for the Republican gubernatorial nomination last spring. 
Before the primary, Rider endorsed Unz, knowing full well it might cost him 
some votes. Then after Unz lost, while winning 34% of the Republican vote, 
Rider began presenting himself as the next best thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Unz recently wrote letters that were published in the state's major newspapers 
urging his supporters not to launch an Unz write-in campaign Nov. 8. Although 
he stopped short of endorsing Rider, Unz asked the 700,000 people who voted for 
him to support "candidates up and down the ticket who are true to the core 
values of the Republican Party -- smaller government, lower taxes and fewer 
regulations." 
</P>
<P>
 Rider said that is as good as an Unz endorsement. After all, Rider proposes 
cutting 90% of all state regulations. And he so abhors taxes that he closed his 
financial planning office in large part to avoid paying them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was working until July 19 for the government," he said. "For a Libertarian, 
that's unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Rider has made sacrifices to run for governor. To enable him to afford 
campaigning full time, Rider and his wife pulled their two sons out of private 
school. ("May God forgive me for that," he said.) The campaign, headquartered 
in one of his spare bedrooms with a "Rider for Governor" bumper sticker taped 
to the door, is truly no-frills. 
</P>
<P>
 His phones are answered by two volunteers -- retirees who refer to Rider as 
"Guv." When Rider is on the road, he often sleeps on supporters' couches. 
Recently, when he heard about a promotion for a time-share condominium, he and 
his wife went and sat through the pitch. The reason: In exchange for their 
time, they received free plane tickets to San Francisco, a city where Rider 
wanted to campaign.

 Most of the $40,000 Rider has been able to raise has gone to buy cable 
television time for his lone commercial, which features the candidate in a 
butcher's smock, whacking a sausage with a meat cleaver and exclaiming, "Wilson 
won't cut taxes, but I will!" By Nov. 8 this spot will have aired in the 
state's five major media markets, and Rider hopes that combined with his 
frequent talk-radio appearances, it will get people's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson campaign officials do not appear worried. With the latest Times poll 
showing the incumbent 9 points ahead of Brown among likely voters, Rider is 
barely a blip on the radar screen. 
</P>
<P>
 But against all odds, Rider perseveres. He knows that some people see voting 
for him as a waste. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been taught since childhood that third parties are dangerous or crazy 
or both," he said, recalling that when he first heard about the Libertarian 
Party in the 1970s he thought it was a "left-wing, commie group." 
</P>
<P>
 "And yeah, sure, we're not going to win," he said. "But the success of a third 
party is in changing the direction of the country. . . . You vote to send a 
message to whoever's in power that this is the direction you want to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the fund-raising message Rider sent Brown has yet to yield a single 
penny. Brown campaign spokesman John Whitehurst said he was unaware of the 
letter asking for $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Rider is not bitter. If Brown is not farsighted enough to see that a hefty 
donation to Rider for Governor could result in her own election, he said, it is 
her loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep checking the mail," he said. "Without my effort, they're dead meat."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; WILSON VOWS TO CUT TAXES IF ELECTED; 
CHALLENGER KATHLEEN BROWN'S CAMPAIGN ASSAILS INCUMBENT AS 'TAX-AND- SPEND' 
REPUBLICAN WHO SIGNED A RECORD INCREASE IN 1991. BOTH CANDIDATES FOCUS ON PROP. 
187. 
</P>

<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, who signed the biggest tax increase in state history in 
1991, said Saturday that he will cut taxes if he is elected to serve a second 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 At a pancake breakfast in Ontario, the Republican incumbent told a crowd of 
about 600 supporters that if he is reelected, "we are going to create enough 
jobs and put enough people back to work in a second term that in fact we are 
going to be able to lower the taxes of this high-tax state." 
</P>
<P>
 Then at a barbecue attended by 300 sign-waving Wilson voters in Valencia, the 
governor repeated the pledge as he drew a contrast between himself and his 
Democratic challenger, Treasurer Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling Brown "a taxer and a spender," Wilson said: "We don't have to get new 
revenues by increasing taxes. We do it by getting new working taxpayers, new 
people who are bringing in good paychecks. When we've got enough of them, a 
reform this state needs -- both in the interest of fairness to taxpayers and to 
make California even more competitive for jobs -- is to cut taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson did not say specifically which taxes he would seek to cut. "We're 
working on (a specific proposal), but it's not something that I can outline for 
you," he told reporters. He also could not say exactly when cuts might be made, 
saying only, "I hope not very far down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown campaign characterized Wilson's tax-cut remarks as a last-minute 
attempt to trick voters with false promises. 
</P>
<P>
 "His lead in the polls is quickly evaporating. His support for the 
immigrant-bashing Proposition 187 is now turning against him. And he's hopeful 
that with only a few days left before the election voters will not be able to 
hear or read about his true record as a tax-and-spend Republican," said Steven 
M. Glazer, a Brown campaign spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete 'Read My Lips' Wilson has enacted a greater level of taxation on 
middle-class families than any state politician in office today. He has failed 
to balance a single budget and has authored more than 200 new tax and fee 
increases -- all the while mouthing the tax-cut mantra," Glazer said. "When 
Wilson's lips move, better hold on to your wallet." 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with a huge state budget deficit the year after he was elected, Wilson 
negotiated and signed a $7-billion tax increase with the Legislature to bridge 
the gap. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates spent much of Saturday talking about Proposition 187, the 
measure that would deny education and health care services to illegal 
immigrants. Wilson repeated his charge that passing Proposition 187 was the 
only way to make federal officials reimburse California for the costs of 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need people who are not even Californians telling us how to vote on 
187," he said at one point. "We will make the decision. We're going to pass 187 
and when we do we will end the unfairness." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown tore into Wilson for his support of the measure as she campaigned in 
Northern and Central California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps there is no issue more telling about character and quality in our 
future than the way this man has cynically used our children and our fears and 
our frustration around the issue of illegal immigration," Brown told about 
1,000 people who attended a rally for Democratic women candidates at the Palace 
of Fine Arts in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The rally was part of an effort to galvanize women voters. Brown shared the 
stage with First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and 
Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin, who is running for state superintendent of public 
instruction against Wilson's education adviser, Maureen DiMarco. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Malcolm, founder of EMILY's List, the fund-raising group for women 
candidates, said her organization would spend $1.25 million on a 
get-out-the-vote effort aimed at California women who are not regular voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women are going to make a difference and women are going to win again in 
1994," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin castigated the governor for cutting schools while raising the prison 
budget by 39.6%. She said the state has ended up with a "Cadillac prison system 
and jalopy schools." In 5,000 years of recorded human history, she added, 
"there was never a country that was considered great because it had the best 
prison system." 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Clinton, just returned from witnessing the signing of the peace treaty 
between Israel and Jordan, praised Feinstein and Brown for their courage -- 
Feinstein for seeking to ban assault rifles and Brown for opposing Proposition 
187. 
</P>
<P>
 Attacking Wilson and Senate candidate Mike Huffington, Clinton said: "We have 
on the one side political candidates who are playing to our fears and who are 
stirring up hatred among us and who are cynically exploiting the modern 
techniques of campaigning in order to convey information oftentimes false about 
their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other side, you have two women, both of whom carry good values, that 
sense of optimism and hope that will make a difference, and already has in the 
lives of real people."

IN SUBURBAN MOSCOW BY-ELECTION, BALLOT OFFERS CAUTIONARY PREVIEW OF 1996 
PRESIDENTIAL RACE; RUSSIA: A RABID NATIONALIST IS AMONG THOSE VYING FOR 
PARLIAMENTARY SEAT. CAMPAIGN RAISES FEARS FOR DEMOCRACY. 
</P>

<P>
 A gangland-style shooting bumped off the last Parliament deputy from this 
suburban Moscow wasteland, so residents will vote for a new one today. 
</P>
<P>
 And the main candidates are: 
</P>
<P>
 * An ultranationalist whose swastika-bearing supporters flash straight-armed 
salutes. 
</P>
<P>
 * A financier facing tax-evasion charges for his now-collapsed pyramid 
company, MMM. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another millionaire, this one considered a democrat, who claimed that mass 
hypnosis influenced the last elections. 
</P>
<P>
 * Not to mention a Russian karate expert. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the wild world of politics, new Russian style. 
</P>
<P>
 This ballot circus could be watched as good fun if it was not considered a 
precursor to a bigger show -- the 1996 presidential elections, when many fear 
that fledgling democracy will give way to Russians' love for "a tough hand." 
</P>
<P>
 That in Mytishchi these days is called "Russian order" -- what Alexander 
Fyodorov, candidate of the black-shirted Russian National Unity movement, 
promises. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only we Russian nationalists can organize bringing the economy out of crisis 
and the revival of Great Russia," he said in an interview. "We have the will. 
Our coming to power is inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not this time. Fyodorov has not led any polls and claims to see the 
Mytishchi elections mainly as a testing ground for campaign tactics to be used 
in Parliament in late 1995 and in the 1996 presidential run. 
</P>
<P>
 But the jackbooted young men who have stacked meetings held with Mytishchi 
voters in recent weeks have already shown that, even if they lack the support 
to win, their catcalls, threats and ability to turn out scores of "brothers in 
arms" allow them to set the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 The election has become "not about getting better lighting in Mytishchi but 
about 'What's your nationality?' " said Sarah Mendelson, observing the race as 
a representative of the National Democratic Institute, a sort of foreign arm of 
the U.S. Democratic Party. "It's become about national identity." 
</P>
<P>
 Millionaire Konstantin Borovoi -- a democrat who is registered as an ethnic 
Russian and Russian Orthodox but has the Jewish-sounding patronymic Natanovich 
-- walked out of a meeting where ultranationalists shouted at him to "Go home 
to Israel!" Nationalists have also strung up banners saying "Zionism will not 
pass." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from walking out of meetings, none of the candidates has responded to 
these provocations with vigor, though Borovoi did print a leaflet with an "X" 
through a swastika. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the extremism of the Fyodorov camp, the Mytishchi race appears to 
indicate a further rise in the Russian nationalism that helped Vladimir V. 
Zhirinovsky trounce other parties in last December's parliamentary elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mytishchi, candidates spouting the nationalist line range from an athlete 
who advocates universal training in the "Russian style" form of martial arts to 
a doctor who complains that "Russia is becoming the vassal of other states." 
</P>
<P>
 But that does not mean rabid nationalism will become the dominant note in 
Russian politics, sociologist Nugzar Betaneli said. 
</P>
<P>
 His recent polls of 6,000 Russians found that only 3% of the population 
believed that ultranationalist leaders would serve their economic and political 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "The population has common sense, and you can depend on it," he said. "The 
people don't ignore their interests." 
</P>
<P>
 If that is so, their popular pragmatism may lead them to vote for Sergei 
Mavrodi, the business whiz behind Russia's biggest investment fund, MMM, whose 
shares collapsed last summer. He now faces tax-evasion charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Mavrodi -- who, if he wins, would enjoy parliamentary immunity from arrest -- 
tells voters that he will be able to restore the value of MMM shares only if he 
is elected and allowed to work in peace. With an estimated 36,000 MMM 
shareholders in the Mytishchi district of about 500,000 people, and the rest of 
the vote likely to be split among 11 other candidates, Mavrodi could win by 
appealing to the most concrete of voter interests. 
</P>
<P>
 In a surprise choice of bedfellows, Mavrodi has joined forces with 
Zhirinovsky's band, the misnamed Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. 
Zhirinovsky paints Mavrodi as a victim of President Boris N. Yeltsin's 
government, just as he sees himself, but he does little to hide his lust for 
Mavrodi's money and has helped openly with his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Mavrodi has promised to invest $100 million in Mytishchi, including $10 
million before Jan. 1 -- and the region of ailing defense factories could 
certainly use it. Even now, after the first winter flurries, some apartments 
have no heat, and home phones are few. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one is interested in politics anymore," Mavrodi said on local television. 
"Voters now are mainly interested in what a candidate can concretely give 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 That apathy, fatigue and disillusionment are perhaps the most salient features 
of the Russian electorate today. Betaneli's polls found that only 7% of 
Russians believe the party they voted for in December has lived up to their 
expectations. And only 12% trust any Russian politician; 53% trust none of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 It is this general cynicism and apathy that make the Mytishchi election 
difficult to call -- and even harder to project to 1995 or 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Asking Mytishchi residents last week whom they would vote for elicited 
responses like the large sigh heaved by dog trainer Yelena Zatyagina, 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't vote for anyone," Zatyagina said. "I trust none of them. For a month 
we've had no heat and no hot water. Who can I believe in?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Horseradish is no sweeter than a turnip," said pensioner Nikolai Kravchenko, 
using a Russian equivalent of "Six of one, half a dozen of the other." 
</P>
<P>
 Polls show the Russian public split into a scattering of small camps, with 
about 10% supporting Western-style democrats, 10% pro-Communist, 10% 
pro-Yeltsin and 10% supporting other groups, including ultranationalists; the 
rest are undecided. Popularity ratings show no political figure breaking the 
15% mark. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mytishchi, a dark horse could end up winning just by garnering 9%, as did 
the deceased deputy, Andrei Ayzderdzis. That could be someone like Alexander 
Zharov, the unapologetic mayor of the district's town of Solnechnogorsk. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain not to win is a would-be deputy from Yeltsin's camp. His folks never 
got their act together enough to field a candidate and ended up supporting 
Borovoi. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course it hurts me to see television reports of those fascist thugs openly 
campaigning in the streets of Moscow," said Lev Ponomaryov, co-chairman of the 
pro-Yeltsin Federal Party of Democratic Russia. "This is their first real 
chance to have their man in Parliament. . . . Unfortunately, we have been very 
busy with our organizational problems recently and didn't have time to prepare 
properly for this by-election." 
</P>
<P>
 The pro-Yeltsin camp has largely been busy dividing itself into new fragments, 
guaranteeing its own confused impotence in the political arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The one ray of light for Russian reformists is that, with the advent of men 
like Fyodorov to oppose Zhirinovsky, the ultranationalist camp appears also to 
be splintering. 
</P>
<P>
 Fyodorov and Russian National Unity have no use for Zhirinovsky; they say he 
stole their ideas and ran with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, they are learning: At the most recent voter meetings, Fyodorov's 
men have begun appearing in suits instead of uniforms, and without their 
swastikas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realized that it turns people off," he said.

ECONOMIC RESPITE FOR N. KOREA SEEN IN NUCLEAR ACCORD; ASIA: U.S. OFFICIALS 
BELIEVE NORTH GAINED TIME TO DEAL WITH SEVERE PROBLEMS BY AGREEING TO FREEZE 
PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 American government analysts have concluded that the nuclear deal the Clinton 
Administration just negotiated with North Korea will provide significant 
economic relief for the fledgling regime of its new leader, Kim Jong Il. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the assistance will probably not make the difference between the 
eventual survival and collapse of one of the world's last Communist 
governments, U.S. officials believe that North Korea has bought some time in 
return for agreeing to freeze its nuclear weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement "takes some of the sting out of their problems," asserted one 
U.S. government expert who closely follows developments in North Korea. "It 
puts them in a better position to deal with the (economic) pressures they are 
under." 
</P>
<P>
 During the 18-month nuclear crisis, some American and South Korean hawks 
argued that the United States and its allies should do as little as possible to 
shore up the Pyongyang regime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through these negotiations . . . you're helping the North Korean regime to 
survive," James Lilley, former U.S. ambassador to South Korea, said last year. 
He warned that over the next five years, North Korea might be able to keep on 
developing its missiles and sell them to countries such as Iran and Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration, by contrast, believes that the importance of stopping 
North Korea's nuclear program outweighs the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. government analysts and some outside experts argue that the economic 
benefits of the Administration's nuclear deal are not enough, by themselves, to 
prevent an eventual collapse of the North Korean economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The American promise to arrange for supplies of fuel oil to North Korea will 
raise by about 25% the amount available for energy-starved North Korean 
factories, experts said. And the American pledge to lift barriers to trade and 
dollar-based transactions could open the way for North Korea to obtain foreign 
investment and other economic benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does this deal do it for them? No," said Nicholas Eberstadt, a Korea 
specialist at the American Enterprise Institute. "It may be cause for 
jubilation in terms of beating the Americans in negotiations, but it doesn't 
put the economy back on its feet. . . . (North Korea) is still a highly 
unattractive environment for foreign investment." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the deal signed in Geneva on Oct. 21, North Korea agreed to an immediate 
freeze of its nuclear weapons program, which the CIA believes has already 
produced enough weapons-grade plutonium for one or two nuclear bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, the Administration agreed to reduce trade barriers between the 
two countries and to clear the way for the opening of diplomatic liaison 
offices in Washington and Pyongyang in the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
 It also agreed to supply North Korea with 500,000 metric tons of fuel oil a 
year and to arrange for construction of two 1,000-megawatt light-water nuclear 
reactors, which cannot easily be used to make fuel for nuclear weapons. These 
new reactors will replace North Korea's gas-graphite reactors, which can more 
readily produce weapons-grade fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea also promised to open the way in about five years for special 
international inspections that would show how many nuclear weapons it might 
have produced. And it agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities and ship 
radioactive fuel rods out of the country in about 10 years, when the 
light-water reactor project is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government specialists said the time delays contained in the deal let 
North Korea postpone, for now, the ultimate decision of whether to abandon its 
nuclear ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agreement puts off the core of the decisions about the nuclear weapons 
program," one official said. "They haven't had to bite the bullet now, and that 
may be important to them (the North Korean leadership) internally." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last five years, North Korea's economy has shrunk by about 20% as the 
country first lost the benefits of economic assistance from the Soviet Union 
and then was required by China to pay for goods at market prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "North Koreans now are told to get by with two meals a day," Korea specialists 
Rinn S. Shinn and Robert Sutter of the Congressional Research Service reported 
in the summer. "Industrial facilities are running at 40% of operating capacity, 
due to shortages of fuel, electricity and raw materials." 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea also faces enormous economic problems because of the need to 
support its army of 1.2 million men, a huge size for a nation of 22 million 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the late 1980s, non-civilian males accounted for fully a fifth of North 
Korea's men of working ages," Eberstadt of the American Enterprise Institute 
wrote last year. "There is no more surplus labor in the country. To satisfy its 
thirst for ever more inductees, the army must deprive state enterprises or 
universities of their recruits." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last few years, U.S. government specialists said, North Korea has 
been able to obtain only about 2 million metric tons of oil a year to keep its 
factories running. In the mid-1980s, before the embargo, North Korea consumed 
more than 3 million metric tons a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The fuel oil provided to North Korea in the deal, one analyst said, will be "a 
significant increase -- but it doesn't take them to fat city. To get their 
economy back in shape, they need that plus whatever else they can get on their 
own." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the U.S. analysts, the North Korean leadership believes that the 
lowering of trade barriers and the broader international legitimacy gained by 
the nuclear deal will help attract foreign investment. "The North Koreans see 
this agreement as opening up a stream of new resources for them," one U.S. 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea promptly began to brag that the nuclear deal conferred a degree of 
official American recognition of a regime that the United States has, in the 
past, often branded a terrorist state. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea's state-controlled media broadcast the full text not only of the 
agreement itself but also of a letter from President Clinton to Kim Jong Il. At 
the time of the broadcasts, Administration officials had not even acknowledged 
the existence of such a letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Special Ambassador Robert L. Gallucci delivered the Clinton letter to North 
Korean officials in Geneva on Oct. 21 when the nuclear deal was signed. In it, 
Clinton gave Kim Jong Il his personal assurance that the United States will 
organize an international consortium to provide the new light-water reactors to 
North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 American officials said Clinton's letter was addressed to "the Supreme Leader 
of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea" and to "His Excellency." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallucci explained that the North Koreans had asked that Clinton address Kim 
in the same glowing terms that they do. "And we addressed it precisely as they 
asked," Gallucci said.

U.N. THREATENS AIR STRIKES ON BOSNIAN GOVERNMENT FORCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.N. peacekeeping force accused government forces of deliberately 
attacking French peacekeepers on Saturday and threatened to call for NATO air 
strikes if the attacks were repeated. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the most serious warning yet to the Muslim-led government army that it 
too could be hit by NATO air strikes, thus far directed only at the Bosnian 
Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Government forces were expanding their strongest offensive of the 31-month 
war, trapping hundreds of Bosnian Serb soldiers on a northwestern front and 
launching an attack on Serbs near Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 The peacekeeping force, in a statement, said four rounds from a government 
army artillery piece landed 25 to 50 yards away from a French peacekeeper 
observation post on Saturday near the Javorak Valley, southwest of Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Peacekeepers were trying to monitor a government infantry and artillery attack 
on Bosnian Serb positions just south of a demilitarized zone on Mt. Igman, 
overlooking Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. force accused the government army of using the demilitarized zone to 
stage the attack on the Bosnian Serbs and of firing artillery from it. The 
government army denied the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Col. Bertrand Labarsouque, a peacekeeper spokesman, said the shelling Saturday 
was considered a direct attack but that U.N. officials decided not to request 
an air strike. 
</P>
<P>
 In northwestern Bosnia, troops of the mostly Muslim government force 
surrounded the town of Bosanska Krupa, trapping several hundred Bosnian Serb 
soldiers, U.N. officials said. Government army sources said their troops had 
entered part of the town. 
</P>
<P>
 With a prewar population of about 20,000, Bosanska Krupa would be the largest 
Serb-held town to fall to the government.

NEW N. KOREA LEADER VOWS TO FULFILL FATHER'S IDEALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 North Korea's apparent leader promised Saturday to carry on his father's 
revolutionary ideals in remarks that could signal he will soon formally take 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency and monitored 
here was Kim Jong Il's first reference to his role in North Korea's future 
since the July 8 death of his father, Kim Il Sung, who ruled the Communist 
state for 46 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Kim had groomed his son as his heir-apparent for 20 years, but the 
younger Kim, often described as lacking charisma and leadership, has not 
formally assumed power. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea watchers in Seoul have said Kim's health or a political shake-up 
may be preventing his succession. Others have said Kim is waiting for an 
opportune moment, rallying people's support for his rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will as ever devote my all to the country and the people, bearing deep in 
mind our people's absolute trust in and expectation for our party," Kim said.

GUERRILLAS, ISRAELI ARMY CLASH IN SOUTH LEBANON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Iranian-backed guerrillas attacked an Israeli post in an occupied strip of 
south Lebanon on Saturday and claimed to have overrun it and set it ablaze. The 
fighting touched off artillery battles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli army said one Israeli soldier was killed and two were wounded. 
Security sources in south Lebanon, speaking on condition of anonymity, said one 
Lebanese civilian was killed and 13 people were wounded, including five Israeli 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fourth straight day of fighting in south Lebanon, the last active 
war front in the Arab-Israeli conflict. The escalation of hostilities was seen 
as a message that Arab extremists remain determined to block peace treaties 
with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours after the morning assault near the village of Dabshe, guerrillas 
of the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah, or Party of God, fired a rocket-propelled 
grenade at an Israeli patrol in Aishiyeh, 1 1/2 miles to the north, inside the 
Israelis' self-designated security zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The security sources said there were no casualties in the second attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent spate of violence flared Wednesday, when Israel and Jordan signed a 
peace treaty in a ceremony attended by President Clinton, who ended his 
six-country, peace-promoting swing through the region early Saturday in Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel's environment minister, Yossi Sarid, said it was possible that Syria, 
the undisputed power in Lebanon, "is convinced that aggression by Hezbollah . . 
. will be useful to Syria in the negotiations . . . and perhaps even lead to 
Israeli concessions." 
</P>
<P>
 "But such acts only lead to a hardening of Israeli positions," Sarid told 
Israel Army Radio.

SUDANESE MAN ARRESTED AS KIDNEY BROKER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Egyptian police Saturday arrested a Sudanese man for arranging sales of human 
kidneys from hard-up Sudanese men and women to wealthy Gulf Arabs, security 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 They said 36-year-old Habib Gamal Din forged letters from the Egyptian 
Doctors' Syndicate authorizing Cairo hospitals to remove kidneys from 
"volunteer" donors and give them to the ailing recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 In one operation, Gamal Din was paid about $3,000 by a Saudi Arabian woman. 
The female Sudanese donor received just $600 for her kidney, the sources said.

EUROPEAN UNION OFFICIALS GET ASSIGNMENTS; DIPLOMACY: SOME OBSERVERS SEE A 
WEAKENED GLOBAL ROLE IN DECISION BY NEW HEAD OF EXECUTIVE COMMISSION TO DIVIDE 
EXTERNAL RELATIONS PORTFOLIO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER MARSHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The incoming head of the European Union's powerful Executive Commission 
distributed portfolios Saturday to his team of 21 commissioners, who will chart 
much of the EC's future over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most controversial move, Commission President-designate Jacques Santer 
decided to split the responsibility for the EU's external relations among four 
commissioners, a decision that some observers fear could weaken the EU's 
effectiveness internationally. 
</P>
<P>
 The new commission is scheduled to begin work in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Santer's choices effectively stripped Leon Brittan, one of the EU's most 
effective and best-known figures, of crucial foreign affairs responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Brittan, who gained prominence late last year as the EU's chief negotiator 
during the final, hectic days of global trade talks, retained his job as head 
of trade relations with the United States, Japan and the industrialized nations 
of the Pacific Rim but was relieved of the key task of developing ties with 
Central and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement after Saturday's meeting, a clearly upset Brittan said he was 
"considering the position that has arisen." His comment fueled speculation that 
he was contemplating resigning. 
</P>
<P>
 Expanding ties with the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe and 
preparing at least some of them to become members of the union by the end of 
the century have become one of the EU's highest priorities. Many believe that 
the region's long-term stability is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, this task passed to Hans van den Broek, the former Dutch foreign 
minister who has been in charge of the EU's external political affairs for two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Van den Broek led negotiations earlier this year with Austria, Finland, Sweden 
and Norway to become members of the EU in January. The Austrian and Finnish 
electorates have ratified the terms of those negotiations, while referendums 
are scheduled next month in Sweden and Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Van den Broek and Brittan, Spain's Manuel Marin and Portugal's 
Joao de Deus Pinheiro will complete the EU's foreign affairs team, sharing 
responsibilities for relations with the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
 Santer, outgoing prime minister of Luxembourg, summoned the new commissioners 
to a secluded chateau in his homeland to tell them who got the prime positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by a bureaucracy of about 15,000 civil servants, the commission is the 
major instigator of Europe-wide legislation and supervises the EU's $80-billion 
annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the 10-year reign of its current president, Jacques Delors, the 
commission has been the driving force behind the creation of the world's single 
richest consumer market. It is now working to implement the terms of the 1991 
Maastricht Treaty, which calls for far closer integration of the member states 
and sets a target of full monetary and political union. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other important portfolios assigned Saturday, two respected 
technocrats, Yves-Thibault de Silguy, a senior French government official, and 
Italian economist Mario Monti, were given jobs that include the task of working 
for a single European currency by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Former French Prime Minister Edith Cresson was given the research portfolio, 
while Britain's former Labor Party leader, Neil Kinnock, was placed in charge 
of transportation policy.

PLAN TO KILL 30 DEER AT ZOO TRIGGERS UPROAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to kill 30 deer to cut costs at the local zoo threw this city into an 
uproar Saturday as noisy demonstrators, shouting "Save Bambi!," vowed to 
impeach the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickets lined the street leading to Mohegan Park Zoo while others demonstrated 
at City Hall -- even though it was closed for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "One caller said: 'Kill the commission, keep the deer,' " said Mary Elizabeth 
Kenyon, secretary to the city manager. "That pretty well sums up the mood." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of fears that the herd could contract rabies or tuberculosis and then 
infect zoo visitors, zoo officials considered an elaborate plan of building 
fences and annually testing the herd. But costs for the program were so high 
that city officials decided to kill the herd.

FRESHMAN HOUSE DEMOCRATS HAVE THEIR FEET TO THE FIRE; CONGRESS: FIRST-TERMERS 
MAKE UP HALF THE LIST OF 'ENDANGERED INCUMBENTS.' THEY FACE THE PUBLIC'S 
GROWING DISDAIN FOR OFFICEHOLDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Facing a surprisingly difficult fight to retain his seat in Congress, Rep. 
Eric D. Fingerhut (D-Ohio) recently exhorted his supporters to work even harder 
at convincing friends and family members to vote for him in the Nov. 8 midterm 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think about the number of people you will come in contact with over 
the course of the next few weeks, just think about how you can influence the 
election," he said, pleading for them to "network" on his behalf in this 
predominantly Republican section of suburban Cleveland. "Tell them it matters 
because (I am) doing things that matter, changing things in Congress," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Why was this man pleading so hard? Not only does he enjoy all the traditional 
advantages of incumbency, he also made a name for himself as leader of the 
reform-minded freshmen Democratic legislators in the 103rd Congress. Isn't that 
what he promised to do when he ran and won back in 1992? Yes it is. But despite 
Fingerhut's best effort, he could well lose this year's election in Ohio's 19th 
District to GOP challenger Steven LaTourette, a popular local prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 And Fingerhut is not alone. According to a recent study by Congressional 
Quarterly, first-term members of the House account for half the names on the 
"endangered incumbents" list, with 31 freshmen among the 63 House members 
judged to be in "competitive races." Democrats outnumber Republicans on the 
list, 23 to 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Swept into office two years ago under President Clinton's battle cry of 
"change," first-term Democratic reformers are now finding themselves struggling 
against a wave of anti-incumbent sentiment among voters who are expressing 
disdain for Clinton and disgust for lawmakers who promise more than they 
deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, many of the more outspoken Democratic reformers hail from 
politically unstable congressional districts that were created by 
reapportionment for the 1992 elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In Utah's 2nd District, for example, incumbent Karen Shepherd is locked in a 
tight race with Republican Enid Greene Waldholtz, whom she defeated, 51% to 
47%, in 1992. Like Fingerhut, Shepherd gained notice in Washington as a 
reformer, but it had little practical advantage back home. Waldholtz has scored 
with voters by pointing to Shepherd's votes supporting the Clinton budget that 
raised taxes -- something candidate Shepherd promised not to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Such arguments find favor with Utah conservatives, who are not fond of Clinton 
or his policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Democratic first-termers encountering similar challenges include Karan 
English of Arizona, Leslie L. Byrne of Virginia, Sherrod Brown of Ohio's 13th 
District and Bart Stupak of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fingerhut stands out in the pack, if only because he led the crusade by 
Democratic freshmen to limit the role of lobbyists, strengthen controls on 
campaign contributions and otherwise reform the way Congress has traditionally 
done business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am reluctant to talk to the national media because of all the attention 
I've received and how little it does to help me in my district," he said in a 
recent interview between campaign stops. 
</P>
<P>
 Fingerhut is now rushing about his district, talking up congressional reform 
and declaring his independence from any orthodoxy in Washington. That was his 
message two years ago and he is pleading with voters to give him another shot 
to complete the job he started. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, however, talking up reform is less pressing than defending 
himself against charges of being a do-nothing incumbent. As a result, his tough 
reelection campaign is a template for the challenges faced by other first-term 
Democrats who went to Washington with a mandate for change, only to discover 
how much easier it is to promise than to deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, we're all in competitive races," Fingerhut said. "But that has nothing 
to do with me and everything to do with the substance of the races and local 
politics." 
</P>
<P>
 Fingerhut's argument is that voters are angry at the inability of Congress to 
make substantive reforms that would give the institution credibility to make 
tougher laws. Congressional leaders -- yes, his Democratic leaders -- wasted a 
prime opportunity to show a skeptical public that lawmakers were willing to get 
their own house in order, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would have made all the difference. That would have put us in a position 
of strength from which we could have tackled and won on the tough choices, 
choices on health care, welfare reform and the budget," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He admitted that the GOP "is having a good year" but he chalked that up to 
"hard, cold politics. . . . It would have been the same for anyone sitting in 
this seat." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, local party officials said the race is competitive in large part 
because the district -- a 130-mile stretch of northeastern Ohio, encompassing 
parts of downtown Cleveland, some southwestern suburbs and all of Lake and 
Ashtabula counties -- is a mixed bag of political ideologies where hard-core 
Democrats make up only a razor-thin majority. 
</P>
<P>
 The district was reshaped after the 1990 census in such a way that many black 
and Jewish voters -- traditional Democrats in the area for many previous 
elections -- were sliced away. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tough district," said Gary Skorepa, the Democratic mayor of North 
Royalton. "This district is a cross-section of suburban to rural to old 
Establishment and inner-ring suburbs. It's a hard district because people here 
vote all over the lot. Some are Democrats. Some are independents. And more and 
more are Republicans." 
</P>
<P>
 Enter LaTourette, who told voters in a Cleveland City Club debate with 
Fingerhut and two independent candidates that the district is "at a crossroads" 
and pitched himself as a "moderate Republican." 
</P>
<P>
 Absent any independent polls, there are no reliable ways of determining 
exactly how competitive the race really is. Yet, Fingerhut apparently isn't 
taking anything for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 At the party rally in suburban Cleveland, the crowd was friendly, if thin. It 
had been a long day for Fingerhut, it was well past dinner hour and only a few 
supporters had turned out in this GOP-dominated corner of the district. 
</P>
<P>
 After recognizing local officials in his opening remarks, he suddenly put the 
microphone down in mid-sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say this is a rally," he said, striding across a parquet dance floor to 
narrow the space between him and his audience. "Well, I'll tell you something. 
I've never been to an old-fashioned political rally where the candidate stands 
this far away from folks. We gotta talk. . . . I gotta get closer to the 
folks." Election '94

 Two members of a banned fraternity chapter at Southeast Missouri State 
University have been sentenced for the hazing death of a pledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent L. King, 21, was sentenced to five years for involuntary manslaughter

SUSPICIONS FLY IN CASE OF TWO MISSING S.C. BROTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite growing public suspicion against a mother who claims her two sons were 
kidnaped in her car, neither she nor anyone else is a suspect in the 
"impossible" case, investigators said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Union County Sheriff Howard Wells refused to confirm or deny reports that 
Susan Smith had failed a police lie-detector test. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to corroborate her story because not only is she the victim in 
this case, but the public is trying to make her the suspect," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Smith's sons -- 3-year-old Michael and 14-month-old Alex Smith -- have 
been missing since Tuesday night. She says a gunman commandeered her car and 
then forced her out, driving away with the children strapped in safety seats. 
</P>
<P>
 No significant leads have turned up despite national publicity and hundreds of 
calls to a tip line. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Smith and her husband, David, from whom she filed for divorce last 
month, have been questioned repeatedly by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities were trying to find a motive. "We haven't had a ransom demand," 
Wells said, and no one seemed "mad at the family." 
</P>
<P>
 Anonymous sources told the Greenville News and the State in Columbia that 
Susan Smith did not pass a polygraph test. The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer 
reported that the test was inconclusive. It was unclear what questions she 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells said he had no immediate plans to question Susan Smith again and 
cautioned against focusing on any individual. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be aware of public speculation and allegations. Persons 
automatically assume things when an investigation goes this long. . . . 
Naturally people are going to speculate," the sheriff said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added, however, "We have not ruled out anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Two intense searches Friday around Union turned up nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 A search for a car matching Susan Smith's, reportedly seen in Shut-In 
Mountain, Tenn., also was fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have dogs here at a moment's notice. We've got a hostage rescue team at a 
moment's notice. We have aircraft that'll take us wherever we need to go," 
Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was nowhere to dispatch them. "Right now, we're trying to do the 
impossible," he said. "We're trying to work a case without a scene."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; PRISON GUARDS SET RECORD WITH GIFT TO WILSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's prison guards, in what apparently is the largest single 
contribution ever reported to a candidate for governor, donated $425,000 on 
Oct. 4 to Gov. Pete Wilson, whose support for longer prison sentences will mean 
the hiring of thousands more guards in the years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. now has given the Republican 
governor a total of $525,000 toward his reelection campaign against Democrat 
Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount is more than three times what California Highway Patrol officers 
gave in 1990 to Democrat Dianne Feinstein, when a $150,000 contribution 
prompted Wilson to castigate her for taking money from state employees whose 
salaries she would have a role in setting. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Brown condemned Wilson on Friday as a hypocrite and accused 
the governor of essentially trading campaign support for favors to the guards' 
union. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson Administration has increased salaries for guards 10% since Wilson 
took office in 1991, after the union spent nearly $1 million in an independent 
advertising campaign to help elect him. Most other state employees got smaller 
raises. 
</P>
<P>
 "This shady arrangement ends the mystery about why prison guards with six 
weeks of training earn more than school teachers," said Steven Glazer, a senior 
adviser to Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Schnur, Wilson's campaign press secretary, said the guards were 
contributing to Wilson because they think he is the candidate most likely to 
keep Californians safe from crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Although private corporations and interest groups have contributed more to 
ballot initiatives, the donation from the guards apparently is the largest 
given to a gubernatorial candidate in modern times, according to the secretary 
of state's office and California Common Cause, which tracks campaign 
contributions.

 A 15-year-old Oxnard graffiti vandal has been sentenced to the California 
Youth Authority for eight years and four months, the harshest punishment ever 
given a tagger in California, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Superior Court Judge Steven Z. Perren handed down the sentence 
last week.The boy, whose name was not released because he is a minor, had 11 
prior misdemeanor graffiti convictions, Deputy Dist. Atty. John Cordoza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perren had given the boy one more chance after he was arrested in August for 
vandalism, Cordoza said. But three days later, the youth pulled metal springs 
from his Juvenile Hall bed and etched his moniker onto walls, books and a light 
fixture, Cordoza said.

HUMOR BRINGS RELIEF FROM ATTACK ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the only political commercial these days with an intended dash of humor, 
"Angus McClintock," the tightwad Scottish pitchman for state controller 
candidate Tom McClintock, is moving to television. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of 15-second spots features Angus, a fictional cousin of the 
Republican nominee, promoting McClintock as the most tight-fisted candidate on 
the political circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 In one ad, Angus starts a timer and says he only needs 15 seconds to portray 
McClintock as the thrifty candidate for state controller. Angus completes his 
pitch in nine seconds, finds he has six seconds left and calls off camera for 
credit for the unused time. 
</P>
<P>
 McClintock's low-budget campaign in his race against Democrat Kathleen Connell 
first used the Angus character in radio commercials, but was unable to buy time 
in major broadcast markets because stations wanted to charge their regular 
rates instead of the discounted rates for political advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides said the McClintock campaign moved up to TV by buying $100,000 worth of 
advertising time in the Los Angeles market. CARL INGRAM

ARISTIDE CALLS ON PEOPLE, LOCAL OFFICIALS FOR PEACE IN TROUBLED COUNTRYSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an urgent speech aimed at rural Haitians and boat people in exile, 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide appealed Saturday for peace in Haiti's 
countryside, where human rights groups report continued beatings and killings 
of civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking on national television and radio from the dining room table of his 
heavily guarded home, Aristide called on the more than 550 rural "section 
chiefs" -- once the enforcers of Haiti's military regime -- to put down their 
weapons and stop attacking the peasants. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the president pleaded with the rural masses who form his 
grass-roots support not to take revenge, even against section chiefs who human 
rights groups said killed at least four people in remote towns in the past two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Aristide suggested that victims of rural violence take their cases to 
the courts -- which, however, have all but ceased to function in most of the 
country. And he appealed for patience as the nation's Parliament plods through 
legislation aimed at enabling newly appointed local officials to launch an era 
of civil justice in the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let us live as brothers and sisters as we are straining the coffee of 
democracy through the filter of justice," Aristide declared, adding later, "We 
don't want the people to retaliate. . . . We know there is a need for justice. 
But we also know violence attracts violence." 
</P>
<P>
 After the speech, the president told reporters he hoped his message would 
reach Haitian boat people living at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, 
Cuba, who he said are still afraid to come home. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are expressing concerns about violence coming from the section chiefs, 
and when those who are in Guantanamo now hear reports like that, they are not 
encouraged to come back," he said. ". . . Now this move puts me into a better 
position to tell them, 'You will get a safer environment.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Human rights groups say the section chiefs are continuing to terrorize 
civilians in several isolated spots in the countryside, outside the protection 
of the 16,000-member U.S. military intervention force. The groups gave the 
names of several individuals believed to be behind the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's message, crafted and broadcast after he met Saturday morning with 
the deputy commander of the U.S. force, also appeared to be directed at the 
American military command, which has covered about 27 towns with Special Forces 
units but has failed to reach remote villages where remnants of the old regime 
continue to rule. 
</P>
<P>
 But throughout his news conference -- Aristide's second since his Oct. 15 
return from exile and his first from the recently renovated suburban villa he 
reclaimed as his home Friday -- Aristide was upbeat about the U.S. military 
intervention and the progress of rebuilding the institutions of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we have reached the point where we can disarm in a peaceful way the 
section chiefs and (paramilitary attaches) ," he said, when asked whether he 
was satisfied with the American military's disarmament efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Underscoring Aristide's comments, U.S.-led forces found a cache of mortars, 
grenades and ammunition, an official said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The weapons, found in a tunnel Friday in Port-au-Prince, were turned over to 
the U.S. military, and no arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide also said he was "satisfied" with the pace of Parliament, which has 
been bogged down in procedural debates over Aristide's prime ministerial 
appointee, Smarck Michel. 
</P>
<P>
 The president, who has kept to the Presidential Palace and his suburban home 
since his arrival, said he hopes to move out into the public limelight soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be there," he said. "I'm still here because I have a lot to do. 
But, at the same time, I try to do my best for the people who are in charge of 
my security."

ENGULFING WAVE OF SCANDALS HAS TURKS CRYING FOR REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The accused -- urbane, well coiffed, very rich -- drove away from court as 
usual in luxury sedans. 
</P>
<P>
 But one recent afternoon, the television cameras stayed. They went home with 
the $700-a-month state prosecutor, Sudi Gener -- on the bus -- trying to learn 
more about this nation's seemingly endemic scandals. 
</P>
<P>
 Power, money, sex, shots in the night. Glitz and gore enough for a soap opera. 
They're all just the most visible part of the "buy anybody" scandals that have 
undermined public faith in Turkey's public institutions and are triggering 
widespread demands here for reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are dealing here with the fate of society. We believe that to obtain the 
just, clean administration that we deserve, we must clean away the dirt from 
the past," wrote commentator Gungor Mengi last week in the newspaper Sabah amid 
calls for a special prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far, the scandals -- unraveling more in the Turkish press than in the 
courts -- show a pattern of collusion and bribery among business people, top 
politicians and directors of state-owned enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot more goes on under the surface, said Tinaz Titiz, a university professor 
and former minister and now a member of the Turkish Parliament. "There is 
corruption at every level, big and small. When people find out that I am in 
Parliament, they back away; the corruption is assumed," he said in an interview 
at his office in Ankara. 
</P>
<P>
 Case in point: The high-living family of former President Turgut Ozal is 
enmeshed in a scandal called Civangate, after a banker who received a 
$3.5-million payoff for engineering a $100-million loan for a businessman. The 
trouble started when Engin Civan left his post as head of a large state-owned 
bank before the loan went through -- but wouldn't repay the bribe. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozal's widow, Semra, was questioned by a prosecutor last week for allegedly 
calling an underworld boss to involve him in the quest for repayment. She 
denies it. Shot three times, Civan developed a pressing sense of contrition, 
talking freely to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Corruption is no stranger to Turkish public life. But analysts say it grew 
exponentially with the breakneck modernization of the 1980s, driven by the 
dynamic Ozal, who died in April, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Striking back from beside Ozal's grave, his politician brother Yusuf Ozal 
recently defended the family: "I don't want to talk politics here, but there's 
been more corruption in the past year than in the first 70 years of the Turkish 
republic." 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives of President Suleyman Demirel -- although not Demirel himself -- 
have been named in inquiries into state land and loan deals. Prime Minister 
Tansu Ciller, a millionaire many times over, called a special news conference 
to explain her wealth and property holdings in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
 Scandal is not restricted to particular parties or families. Newspapers 
sometimes question how the leader of the straight-arrow pro-Islamic Welfare 
Party got so rich; business leaders close to the party are accused of siphoning 
funds donated to help Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 In Istanbul, social democratic administrators used the city water authority as 
a source of party funds in exchange for contracts. The shenanigans became 
public after the authority chairman ran off with his secretary, and his wife 
told all. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no checks and balances in the government or in the judicial system; 
the system's not working," Sabah senior columnist Hasan Cemal said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, the climate of scandal has all but paralyzed a poorly paid public 
administration fearful of being tarred. 
</P>
<P>
 And popular resentment is already inflicting savage political damage. In one 
recent poll, 69% agreed that "the state does not fulfill its responsibilities 
toward its citizens," and 76.9% agreed that "the state apparatus has become a 
toy in the hands of politicians." 
</P>
<P>
 In another sobering opinion sample, the army emerged as the country's most 
trusted institution; only 20% said they trusted politicians. And as scandals 
roll on amid triple-digit inflation and a lackluster economy, Turks regard 
political parties thronging a divided and indecisive Parliament with almost 
total cynicism: Only 1% say they trust them.

VICTIM HURT, SUSPECT INJURED IN PAIR OF O.C. CARJACKINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Saturday carjackings left the victim of one in Fountain Valley seriously 
injured and the suspect of another in Huntington Beach critically injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Assailants beat a 58-year-old man in the Fountain Valley and stole his van 
with $30,000 worth of blue jeans inside, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said three robbers with handguns approached the victim as he was 
backing the vehicle out of his driveway in the 11000 block of Begonia Avenue. 
They beat him in the head with their guns before pulling him out of the 1985 
Ford van, police said. He was taken to Fountain Valley Hospital where he was in 
serious but stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities were searching for the assailants and the van, which has the 
license plate 2M73413. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Huntington Beach incident, Jesse Maldanado Jr., 31, of Hawaiian Gardens 
was hospitalized after crashing the 1990 Ford Mustang he allegedly stole from a 
parking lot off Pacific Coast Highway near the city pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said a Ventura man was standing next to his unlocked car about 4:20 
p.m. when a gunman stole it. A Huntington Beach motorcycle officer spotted the 
car and gave pursuit. The chase ended when the car crashed into four others, a 
signal pole and a wall at Newland Street and Garfield Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Maldanado was listed in critical condition at UCI Medical Center.

VIOLENT CRIME DECLINES SHARPLY IN CENTRAL L. A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YVETTE CABRERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Violent crime in central Los Angeles has substantially decreased in the first 
nine months of the year, reflecting a citywide trend in which the number of 
murders, robberies, rapes and aggravated assaults fell by 17.3% compared with 
the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 From January to September, the latest month for which figures are available, 
all but one of the Los Angeles Police Department's 18 divisions registered 
drastic reductions in violent crime, with the exception being the Harbor 
Division. Violent crime there increased 6%, although the division still has one 
of the lowest crime rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Central Division had a 45% decrease in robberies and a 36% decrease in 
rapes compared to the same period last year. The Rampart Division is far below 
last year's murder figures. To date, Rampart has had 72 murders, compared with 
107 homicides at this time last year, according to LAPD statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Property crimes, which include burglaries and auto thefts, also decreased in 
all of the LAPD's divisions by 13.9%, according to officials from the LAPD 
crime analysis unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Most experts cautioned, however, that the trend may not signal a long-term 
decrease in crime, which has risen steadily over the last three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year's decrease in crime is not as significant as it might seem. Crime 
rates have been high since the '60s and have been steadily climbing since 
then," said Richard Scribner, a USC professor of preventive medicine who 
recently completed an extensive study of factors that affect crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, although there have been decreases of 10% to 14% in the crime rates over 
the years, these decreases should be seen in the context of the previous 
decades. If you look at the big picture, these crime rate fluctuations are just 
blips in an overall trend that is continuing to climb." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Police Chief Robert Gil, who commands the Central Bureau, which 
consists of four divisions at the core of the city, was cautiously pleased with 
the recent decrease. But, like Scribner, he saw no reason to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decrease is great, but I think we should look at the long-term crime 
rates, not this year's rates, which are just compared to last year's figures," 
Gil said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, crime analysts and residents had various theories to explain the 
recent decrease. But the prevailing theory holds that the decrease may be 
attributable in part to a population decline among 13- to 26-year-olds, who 
account for most of the people committing violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a population window of 13- to 26-year-olds who commit the crimes, 
and as the window of candidates moves on in life, they commit fewer crimes," 
said Detective Bob Stresak, supervisor of the crime analysis unit. 
</P>
<P>
 USC sociology Prof. Malcolm Klein, who has studied Los Angeles crime trends 
since 1962, agreed with Stresak's theory but added that in 10 years, the baby 
boomlet of the late 1980s will once again boost the size of the crime-prone 
age. 
</P>
<P>
 The January earthquake may also have contributed to the decrease. Crime rates 
tend to dip after natural disasters, Stresak said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department has not taken much credit for the decrease. Milt 
Stevens, an LAPD management analyst, said that because the number of arrests 
have not increased, the department's role in the decrease is inconclusive. And 
in the wake of such violent incidents as the killing of three people and 
wounding of five in a multiple shooting last week in South-Central Los Angeles, 
officers remain busy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still fill the patrol cars, because even with the decline in crime, there 
are still plenty of things to do -- we are not experiencing any shortage of 
crime," Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures have also provided more fuel to a long-simmering debate over the 
relationship of liquor stores and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Scribner's study found that areas with high densities of alcohol outlets have 
high crime rates. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50% of all violent crimes involve alcohol, Scribner says, and with 
an abundance of mini-marts, mom-and-pop grocery stores and liquor stores, South 
Los Angeles had been particularly susceptible to crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But half of the liquor stores in South Los Angeles burned in the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is the destruction of these alcohol outlets linked to the low crime rates? 
What we are seeing is consistent with our theory," said Scribner, whose study 
will be published in the American Journal of Public Health in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fights, the people having a little too much to drink and cussing people 
out -- the kinds of things that make you feel unsafe -- have decreased since 
our local liquor store has been gone," said Sylvia Lacy, whose dry-cleaning 
business on 51st and Main streets in South-Central Los Angeles was across the 
street from a liquor store that burned down during the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 But liquor store owners have hotly contested the suggestion that their 
businesses are a major contributor to crime. 
</P>
<P>
 James Colquitt, owner for seven years of Fair Way Liquor at Hoover and 54th 
streets, said gang and drug activity are more often behind violent crime than 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't sell dope; we are not involved with the gangs. We patrol our area, 
and we hire people from the area to work in the liquor store," Colquitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others speculate that the new "three-strikes law" has shaken criminals, 
although many scholars dismiss this theory. The law, in effect since March, 
mandates that a criminal with two prior convictions for serious or violent 
crimes receive 25 years to life in prison after a third felony. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are in jail, so they can't be out here doing the same crimes," Central 
Division Detective Supervisor Jack Luther said. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein, however, disputed this notion, especially as it applies to killings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The striking thing about this decrease is that it comes at the same time 
politicians are cracking down on crime, but there is no relationship between 
the three-strikes legislation and the low murder rates. Legislation follows 
rather than affects crime rates," Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murders, he added, are least affected by any type of legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most homicides are between family members or friends; they are often 
impulsive and expressed through anger, which means they are least susceptible 
to our attempts to reduce them. I would expect the three-strikes law to affect 
planned crimes, such as property crimes and thefts, rather than impulsive 
crimes," Klein said.

 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * GANG PROGRAM FUNDING: Approved a $1.8-million contract with the County of 
Los Angeles for the continuation through Oct. 1, 1995, of the Community Youth 
Gang Service Project. The county contracts with the Community Youth Gang 
Services Corp., a nonprofit organization, for administration of the program, 
which deploys mobile teams in efforts to reduce gang violence. A spokesman for 
the Los Angeles Police Department said the project has been effective in 
reducing gang-related crime in targeted areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * RAILROAD CROSSING STUDY: Instructed the Department of Transportation and the 
Bureau of Street Maintenance to conduct a study of the city's railroad 
crossings to determine the number that need repair. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 How South-Central and Eastside City Council representatives voted on selected 
issues.  
</P>
<P>
 * CONTROVERSIAL MURAL: Denied a motion that would have instructed the Cultural 
Affairs Department to find another location for a controversial mural depicting 
the Black Panthers that is to be painted on a wall at Jefferson Boulevard and 
11th Avenue. The mural, which is titled "To Protect and Serve" and depicts 
several armed Black Panther leaders, is sponsored by the Social and Public Arts 
Resource Center. Councilman Nate Holden, in whose district the mural site is 
located, made the motion seeking another place for it. "This is worse then 
hollering fire in a crowded theater," Holden said. Would they allow a mural of 
Nazis on Fairfax Avenue?" Opponents of the motion stated that since the 
Cultural Affairs Department had already issued a permit for the mural, the arts 
resource center had the right to locate it where originally planned. In voting 
against the motion, Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg criticized the Holden's 
proposal as "bordering on cultural censorship." Additionally, an amendment to 
have the mural located in the California Afro-American Museum was defeated. 
Funding for the mural will be provided by the arts resource center, which had 
earlier withdrawn the work from its list of city-funded projects. Motion 
failed: 2-8. Voting Yes: Holden, Rudy Svorinich, Jr. Voting no: Mike Hernandez, 
Goldberg, Mark Ridley-Thomas, Rita Walters. Absent: Richard Alatorre. 
</P>
<P>
 * AFFORDABLE HOUSING: Authorized the city to provide a $546,000 acquisition 
and pre-development loan to the Hollywood Community Housing Apartments, a 
27-unit low-income housing project at 1626-1632 Normandie Ave. The building, 
which was boarded up in 1992 because of deteriorated conditions, requires 
seismic reinforcement, a new roof, flooring, kitchen and bathroom fixtures, and 
replacement of electrical, mechanical, plumbing and fire sprinkler systems. 
Passed 12-0. Voting yes: Goldberg, Holden, Hernandez, Ridley-Thomas, Svorinich, 
Walters. Absent: Alatorre. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; CABLE SHOWS PLAN TURKEY GIVEAWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The staffs of two cable television shows will combine their efforts this year 
to raise money for a Thanksgiving turkey giveaway that they hope will feed 100

VOICES: A HAVEN WHERE FEAR, IGNORANCE AREN'T WELCOME; GRACIELA MORALES AND THE 
GATHERING PLACE SUPPORT, COUNSEL AIDS SUFFERERS AND THEIR CARE GIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Graciela Morales has been executive director of the Gathering Place -- a 
Southwest Los Angeles drop-in center for people with AIDS and HIV -- since 
April, 1994. Born in Fresno , Morales has worked as an educator and a 
counselor. She has trained health care workers and therapists in how to deal 
with HIV-positive patients and, as a consultant to the Centers for Disease 
Control, she helps write study guides for professionals who work with 
HIV-positive clients. She recently spoke at one of the first Women and AIDS 
symposiums ever held in Japan. Morales worked as a psychotherapist at T.H.E. 
Clinic before joining the staff at The Gathering Place. She has three adult 
children and lives in Alhambra. She was interviewed by Karen E. Klein . 
</P>
<P>
 We try to provide a non-judgmental atmosphere for HIV-positive members and 
their care givers at The Gathering Place. It's the only daytime drop-in center 
for people with HIV infection and AIDS in the Southwest area of the city. We 
have 125 to 130 members who use the center each month. 
</P>
<P>
 They're allowed to come here at their leisure. They get a hot lunch, nutrition 
counseling, food staples, clothing and referrals to other services and 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, we want them to leave with the knowledge that they have been 
treated as an individual here. Because they're HIV-positive, that stigmatizes 
them in a lot of settings. There are not many others who understand where 
they're coming from. 
</P>
<P>
 You could say that AIDS has become my life's mission. I'm not HIV-infected and 
I don't have any close family members who are infected. But I'm a very 
spiritual person and the mission and the goals of The Gathering Place fit me. 
I've always been a caregiver and I have a ministerial background, so I see my 
profession as a ministry. This is what God wants me to do. 
</P>
<P>
 I was referred to T.H.E. Clinic as an intern while I was doing my doctoral 
work in educational counseling at UCLA. One of my professors thought it would 
be good for me. I had never counseled in the field of health but I started 
counseling prenatal women at the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 I came across my first HIV patient, a woman who was six months pregnant. When 
the nurse-supervisor told me I had to counsel this woman, I fell apart. I was 
afraid of AIDS, I was terrified of it. 
</P>
<P>
 I went back to school and told my professor, "You didn't tell me I had to deal 
with AIDS!" So he said, "OK, let's get you some training." 
</P>
<P>
 I got training and began to counsel this patient and other HIV-positive 
patients. Being who I am, I wanted to do more. So I became a trainer for other 
counselors who had to deal with HIV-positive clients.  
</P>
<P>
 It's always been inherent in me to be an advocate. I've been an activist all 
my life; it's a calling. I can't give these people money or wealth, but I can 
give part of myself. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gathering Place has been around for four years, but within the last year 
and a half it has turned into more of a family oriented center. We have about 
64% males and 36% females, but the number of women is increasing constantly. 
Four percent of our members are children. 
</P>
<P>
 About 70% of our members are African American, 26% are Latinos, 3% are 
Caucasian and about 1% are Asian. 
</P>
<P>
 With such a high percentage of African Americans and Latinos, the whole family 
becomes involved when one family member is infected. The care givers, who are 
usually family members, may be uninfected but they come in here for services, 
too. They also need support.  
</P>
<P>
 At times, I've had whole families come into my office and I've helped one 
person tell all the others that they have tested positive for HIV. It's a very 
difficult job, and it's very taxing emotionally and physically. 
</P>
<P>
 My entire staff -- I have three full-time and four part-time -- is trained to 
listen and to give social support. They recognize that while they're 
professionals, they also have to be able to push that professionalism aside and 
just listen to the person who is coming in for services. That's what we're able 
to do that a lot of other agencies can't do. 
</P>
<P>
 When I first came here, I was told that because I am Latina and the clientele 
here is largely African American, I'd have difficulty working with them. But 
that has not been true at all. 
</P>
<P>
 HIV and AIDS infects everyone. It doesn't see color. When our members come in, 
they don't see color. I don't see color lines, or gender lines or 
sexual-orientation lines.  
</P>
<P>
 For those members whose disease is advanced, we offer connections to hospices, 
we help them with their wills and with child care and we arrange for adoptions. 
Hopefully, all that burden is taken off of them before they get to the end 
stages of AIDS.  
</P>
<P>
 Recently, we've seen a lot more homeless people infected with HIV at The 
Gathering Place. A year ago, 10% of our members were homeless. Now, it's more 
like 23%. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeless spend a lot of time here. This is their home away from no home. 
They come and use our sofas.  
</P>
<P>
 One man asked me for a tarp to cover up his space on the street, because he 
told me his spot would get taken if he didn't have a tarp. I got him a tarp and 
he was so grateful. Most of us complain about the place we live in. He just 
wanted a tarp. 
</P>
<P>
 We always need financial support, particularly now for women's and children's 
services, and we need volunteers. who can serve lunches, talk to the members, 
provide transportation, do office work, you name it. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope more people can get beyond their fears about AIDS and their ignorance.  
</P>
<P>
 If I had stayed in a fearful position, I wouldn't be here today. Once you 
conquer that fear, there's no telling what you can do.

HOT LUNCH PROGRAM AT OUTREACH MINISTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read the article "Heeding the Call to Help" (City Times, Oct. 23). I was 
surprised and upset at the incorrect remarks made by Garland Robinson 
concerning the outreach compassionate ministry of the First Church of the 
Nazarene of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 To note some of the inconsistencies and outright flagrant remarks: 
</P>
<P>
 He was not present on our site on Friday to minister to the homeless because 
we do not have a Friday service, nor have we ever had one. 
</P>
<P>
 We have no third floor to serve the participants with lunch bags, nor would we 
ever think of throwing the bags out of a window. In fact, we distributed the 
bag lunches from our front office. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that there is a new development in our program. Due to internal 
restructuring and lack of funding, we made some changes. I was appointed to 
head the compassionate ministry of our church. 
</P>
<P>
 In my assignment, I was given the liberty to make some changes. 
</P>
<P>
 I decided to have hot-lunch service rather than a lunch-bag program. I felt it 
was more in keeping with the dignity of our street friends and more satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a hit and still is. It gives us more of an opportunity to be with our 
people and to share.  
</P>
<P>
 We have never in the 5 1/2 years that I have been here felt distance, 
fearfulness or threatening by our street people.  
</P>
<P>
 We were glad to have Mr. Robinson (who worked briefly as a volunteer), as well 
as any of our street people, sit, pray and have fellowship with us.  
</P>
<P>
 We have problems, but our street friends are not one of them.

GAME OF THE WEEK; LANDAZURI'S EXTRA EFFORT KEYS VICTORY FOR SOUTH GATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 South Gate High overcame a sluggish start to defeat Southeastern Conference 
rival Bell, 14-13, Friday night at Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 With South Gate clinging to a 14-7 fourth-quarter lead, Bell quarterback Gus 
Valenzuela connected with Freddie Alcala on a 16-yard touchdown pass with 44 
seconds left.Bell opted to go for the two-point conversion, but South Gate's 
Ronnie Landazuri broke up a pass to preserve the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to go for the win," Bell Coach Henry Santiago said. "If I had to do 
it again, I would do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Landazuri, a junior defensive back, also had two interceptions, including a 
pass in the end zone to end a Bell scoring threat in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew this game would come down to who scored the most points in the fourth 
quarter," Landazuri said.  
</P>
<P>
 Landazuri's heroics ruined an 82-yard drive by the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate scored the game-winning points when quarterback Juan Vasquez hooked 
up with Eddie Montez on a 34-yard touchdown. Vasquez completed 10 of 20 passes 
for 203 yards and two touchdowns to Montez, who had five receptions for 103 
yards. The Rams' Hoffman Cortes gained 106 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate had two opportunites to score inside the 10-yard line in the first 
half but fell short. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams led 6-0 on a 21-yard pass from Vasquez to Montez with eight minutes 
left in the third quarter. Dulio Orellana blocked the extra point. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell scored on its next possession with Herrera hauling in an 11-yard pass 
from Valenzuela. Vern Benard, who rushed for 79 yards in 17 carries, gained 62 
yards in six tries on the drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenuzela completed 15 of 22 passes for 170 yards and two touchdowns.

VOLLEYBALL; BELL GARDENS MAKES SAN GABRIEL SWEAT OUT A VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Gabriel High volleyball team defeated Bell Gardens to move a step 
closer to its fourth consecutive league title, but it didn't come without a 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
 It took more than two hours for San Gabriel to put away the Lancers on 
Tuesday, 15-10, 11-15, 15-12, 15-7, in the battle for the Almont League lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very disappointed but I'm glad we gave them all we had," said freshman 
outside hitter Kristi Reyes of Bell Gardens. "They didn't have an easy time." 
</P>
<P>
 San Gabriel, winner of 13 league titles in the last 15 years, improved to 13-3 
and 7-0 in league with three matches remaining. The Matadors have won every 
Almont League volleyball title since the league was formed in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Gardens, which finished second to San Gabriel last year, is 10-3 and 5-2. 
The Lancers also lost in four games to the Matadors in the teams' first meeting 
Oct. 6 for their only other league loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Valenzuela had 17 kills and five aces for Bell Gardens. Diane Cardoso and 
Reyes added nine and eight kills, respectively, and Georgina Juarez had six 
aces for the Lancers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some amount of fear the first time we played San Gabriel because 
they have won league so many times," said Valenzuela, a junior middle blocker. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew what to expect and weren't in awe this time, but what killed us was 
team unity. On a couple of points, we just didn't seem to want it as much as 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 San Gabriel, boosted by Allison Carey who led the Matadors with 17 kills, 
scored six consecutive points to overcome a 6-4 deficit and take a 10-6 lead in 
the first game. The Lancers rebounded to win the second game after breaking a 
9-9 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Gardens, playing at home, rallied from an 8-3 deficit to close to 13-12 
in the third game, but was unable to tie the score on three consecutive 
sideouts. The Matadors dominated the fourth game to secure the victory, jumping 
to a 7-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think both teams are relatively equal, but San Gabriel had a lot more 
consistency," Bell Gardens Coach Jesse Rodriguez said. "We had too many mental 
mistakes, especially in Game No. 3."

NOTEBOOK; FORFEITS JEOPARDIZE LOCKE'S POSTSEASON PLAY

<P>
 One City football team suffered and others benefited from sanctions handed 
down last week for the use of ineligible players. 
</P>
<P>
 The Locke High football team forfeited victories over Fremont and Huntington 
Park for using an ineligible player, City Commissioner Barbara Fiege said 
Wednesday. Crenshaw, meanwhile, benefited when Carson was forced to forfeit two 
games for its infraction. The Cougars, who originally lost to Carson, 21-20, 
improved to 7-1 overall and 5-0 in the Southern Pacific Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The Locke player was discovered by school administrators to exceed eight 
semesters of athletic eligibility. With the forfeit victory, Fremont's record 
is 6-0, 5-0 in the Southeastern Conference. Huntington Park is 1-5 and 1-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate that something of this magnitude has occurred," Fiege said. 
"However, to Locke's credit, the administration handled the situation 
immediately upon discovering the student ineligibility." 
</P>
<P>
 The losses jeopardize Locke's chances of qualifying for postseason play. The 
Saints, 0-5 and 0-6 going into Friday night's game, must win all their 
remaining games to be considered. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing is a mess," Locke Coach E.C. Robinson said. "No one told me 
the player was ineligible. He wasn't a key player." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second rules infraction for Locke this season. Locke had been 
placed on two years' probation for contacting players outside the school's 
boundaries. No penalties were attached to the probation.

 Ready to sign -- (Moose) Bailey's future collegiate basketball career appears 
draped in purple and white. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-1 senior point guard fom Loyola is expected to sign a letter of intent 
with the University of Portland on Nov. 9 during the one-week early signing 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing two-on-two with friends at his Ladera Heights home, Bailey said he was 
excited about the prospect of playing for the West Coast Conference school. His 
father, John, showed pictures of his son's recent on-campus visit.

 Miller Time/Prime Time -- Mike Miller has done an impressive job in his two 
years as coach of the Los Angeles City College basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs, who went from a 15-15 record in 1992 to a 27-6 finish last season, 
suffered a one-point loss to Chaffey in the semifinal round of the California 
Community College championships. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs are ranked sixth in the nation by Jucodigest magazine. The only 
California team ranked higher was top-seeded Chaffey (32-6). 
</P>
<P>
 Returning for Miller are All-Southern California Athletic Conference players 
Markee Brown, Sai Tuialli and Derek Higgins. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a 6-2 guard, led the Cubs in scoring at 18 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
 But expectations are even higher in 1994 because of a fresh load of new 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the pack is 6-6 forward Derrick Brown, a redshirt sophomore from New 
York City whom Miller calls "my most recruited player." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, 6-5 Terrance Askew from Chicago Crane and 6-8 Tony Cummings from 
the University of Hawaii, will strengthen an already powerful frontcourt. 
Freshman Jason Wright was rated third among point guards at the Rick Ball 
Ballstars Camp in Indiana last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman guard Calvin Patterson, an All-City performer averaged 19 points a 
game at Fremont.

INCUMBENTS RUNNING ON FIRM GROUND; POLITICS: THERE'S GLOOMY PREDICTIONS FOR 
OFFICEHOLDERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. BUT ANALYSTS SAY THAT WON'T BE THE CASE IN 
DEMOCRATIC STRONGHOLDS IN CENTRAL LOS ANGELES.

<P>
 Across the country, political pundits are predicting that incumbents will be 
defeated at every level of government Nov. 8. But in Central Los Angeles, 
analysts say, that will not be the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In local districts, some of which are up to 88% Democratic, races are 
traditionally decided in the primaries, and Republicans seem to run for the 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 That sums up the picture this year, although some local elections aren't 
completely ho-hum. One race to watch is the 37th Congressional District, where 
Rep. Walter R. Tucker III (D-Compton), who was indicted last month on 10 counts 
of federal extortion and tax evasion, faces Libertarian Guy Wilson, a merchant 
seaman. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker is almost guaranteed a victory in the district, which includes Compton, 
Willowbrook and parts of Athens and Los Angeles and is 77% Democratic, but 
observers are curious about whether his winning margin will be affected by 
negative publicity. ASSEMBLY / 45th District 
</P>
<P>
 * Area: Parts of Hollywood and Downtown Los Angeles, Echo Park and Silver 
Lake.

<P>
 * Background: This district, with a 63% Latino population, has elected Latino 
Assembly candidates since 1972. Democrat Antonio Villaraigosa won a bitter 
primary battle with 49.6% of the vote and is expected to clean up in this 
heavily Democratic district. He would replace Richard Polanco, who vacated the 
seat to run for the state Senate.

VIOLENT CRIME DECLINES DRASTICALLY IN CENTRAL L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YVETTE CABRERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Violent crime in central Los Angeles has substantially decreased in the first 
nine months of the year, reflecting a citywide trend in which the number of 
murders, robberies, rapes and aggravated assaults fell by 17.3% compared with 
the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 From January to September, the latest month for which figures are available, 
all but one of the Los Angeles Police Department's 18 divisions registered 
drastic reductions in violent crime, with the exception being the Harbor 
Division. Violent crime there increased 6%, although the division still has one 
of the lowest crime rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Central Division had a 45% decrease in robberies and a 36% decrease in 
rapes compared to the same period last year. The Rampart Division is far below 
last year's murder figures. To date, Rampart has had 72 murders, compared with 
107 homicides at this time last year, according to LAPD statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Property crimes, which include burglaries and auto thefts, also decreased in 
all of the LAPD's divisions by 13.9%, according to officials from the LAPD 
crime analysis unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Most experts cautioned, however, that the trend may not signal a long-term 
decrease in crime, which has risen steadily over the last three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year's decrease in crime is not as significant as it might seem. Crime 
rates have been high since the '60s and have been steadily climbing since 
then," said Richard Scribner, a USC professor of preventive medicine who 
recently completed an extensive study of factors that affect crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, although there have been decreases of 10% to 14% in the crime rates over 
the years, these decreases should be seen in the context of the previous 
decades. If you look at the big picture, these crime rate fluctuations are just 
blips in an overall trend that is continuing to climb." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Police Chief Robert Gil, who commands the Central Bureau, which 
consists of four divisions at the core of the city, was cautiously pleased with 
the recent decrease. But, like Scribner, he saw no reason to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decrease is great, but I think we should look at the long-term crime 
rates, not this year's rates, which are just compared to last year's figures," 
Gil said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, crime analysts and residents had various theories to explain the 
recent decrease. But the prevailing theory holds that the decrease may be 
attributable in part to a population decline among 13- to 26-year-olds, who 
account for most of the people committing violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a population window of 13- to 26-year-olds who commit the crimes, 
and as the window of candidates moves on in life they commit fewer crimes," 
said Detective Bob Stresak, supervisor of the LAPD crime analysis unit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 USC sociology professor Malcolm Klein, who has studied Los Angeles crime 
trends since 1962, agreed with Stresak's theory but added that in 10 years the 
baby boomlet of the late 1980s will once again boost the size of the 
crime-prone age. 
</P>
<P>
 The January earthquake also may have contributed to the decrease. Crime rates 
tend to dip after natural disasters, Stresak said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department has not taken much credit for the decrease. Milt 
Stevens, an LAPD management analyst, said that because the number of arrests 
have not increased, the department's role in the decrease is inconclusive. And 
in the wake of such violent incidents as the killing of three people and 
wounding of five in a multiple shooting last week in South-Central Los Angeles, 
officers remain busy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still fill the patrol cars, because even with the decline in crime there 
are still plenty of things to do -- we are not experiencing any shortage of 
crime," Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures have also provided more fuel to a long-simmering debate over the 
relationship of liquor stores and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Scribner's study found that areas with high densities of alcohol outlets have 
high crime rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50% of all violent crimes involve alcohol, Scribner says, and with 
an abundance of mini-marts, mom-and-pop grocery stores and liquor stores, south 
Los Angeles had been particularly susceptible to crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But half of the liquor stores in south Los Angeles burned in the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is the destruction of these alcohol outlets linked to the low crime rates? 
What we are seeing is consistent with our theory," said Scribner, whose study 
will be published in the American Journal of Public Health in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fights, the people having a little too much to drink and cussing people 
out -- the kinds of things that make you feel unsafe -- have decreased since 
our local liquor store has been gone," said Sylvia Lacy, whose dry-cleaning 
business on 51st and Main streets in South-Central Los Angeles was across the 
street from a liquor store that burned down during the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 But liquor store owners have hotly contested the suggestion that their 
businesses are a major contributor to crime. 
</P>
<P>
 James Colquitt, owner for seven years of Fair Way Liquor on Hoover and 54th 
streets, said gang and drug activity are more often behind violent crime than 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't sell dope; we are not involved with the gangs. We patrol our area, 
and we hire people from the area to work in the liquor store," Colquitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others speculate that the new "three strikes" law has shaken criminals, 
although many scholars dismiss this theory. The law, in effect since March, 
mandates that a criminal with two prior convictions for serious or violent 
crimes receive 25 years to life in prison after a third felony. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are in jail, so they can't be out here doing the same crimes," Central 
Division Detective Supervisor Jack Luther said. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein, however, disputed this notion, especially as it applies to murders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The striking thing about this decrease is that it comes at the same time 
politicians are cracking down on crime, but there is no relationship between 
the 'three strikes' legislation and the low murder rates. Legislation follows 
rather than affects crime rates," Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murders, he added, are least affected by any type of legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most homicides are between family members or friends; they are often 
impulsive and expressed through anger, which means they are least susceptible 
to our attempts to reduce them. I would expect the 'three strikes' law to 
affect planned crimes, such as property crimes and thefts, rather than 
impulsive crimes," Klein said. Crime Stats by Division: Jan. to Sept. 30, 1994

LABOR LEADERS AIM EFFORTS AT IMMIGRANTS; ORGANIZERS WANT TO RECRUIT INDUSTRIAL 
WORKERS FROM A WIDE AREA INTO UNION FOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Labor leaders hope to target hundreds of thousands of immigrant industrial 
workers along the Alameda Corridor in a massive campaign they say would trans 
form union organizing in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Never before in Los Angeles -- and rarely elsewhere -- have organizers 
attempted to create a regionwide, multi-union drive targeting entire 
industries, said Peter Olney, coordinator of the Los Angeles Manufacturing 
Action Project (LAMAP) and a longtime labor organizer. 
</P>
<P>
 LAMAP, a new nonprofit group of labor and community activists and scholars, 
plans to begin organizing ethnic workers next year along the Alameda Corridor, 
an industrial swath that cuts through Los Angeles from Downtown to the port. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the corridor are some of the county's grittiest neighborhoods, where 
industry sometimes abuts schoolyards and where tens of thousands of jobs have 
been lost in the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 But as aerospace, auto and other large industries have left the area, 
industries that produce textiles, apparel and other non-durable goods have 
remained relatively stable. 
</P>
<P>
 About 66% of the workers in those jobs are Latino and 8.6% are Asian Pacific 
immigrants, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Most work in 
non-union shops for low wages and no benefits, and many live in nearby 
communities on the Eastside, in the Southeast area and in South-Central Los 
Angeles, said Olney, a former organizer for the Service Employees International 
and furniture workers unions. 
</P>
<P>
 This immigrant population, working jobs with no real safety nets or future, is 
ripe for organizing, said David Sickler, regional director of the AFL-CIO 
Region 6 and LAMAP co-founder.  
</P>
<P>
 "If there was an economic ladder those people in the Alameda Corridor could 
climb, it would be different," Sickler said. "But you have a permanent 
underclass there, and that's where seeds of discontent are sown." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, but Gordon Richards, chief economist for the National Assn. of 
Manufacturers, said the higher wages that would accompany unionization could 
raise unemployment as employers are forced to cut their work forces. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "When you force wages up, you slow the rate of job creation," Richards said. 
"If you raise wages within particular industries, these firms would likely 
employ less. If you squeeze a producer's profit margin, they need to make it up 
somewhere and they aren't going to raise prices." 
</P>
<P>
 LAMAP, funded with a start-up grant from the San Francisco-based Rosenberg 
Foundation, has enlisted UCLA's Community Scholars program, a joint initiative 
of the school's Department of Urban Planning and Center for Labor Research and 
Education, to analyze which industries in the Alameda Corridor should be 
organized.

 When the UCLA group completes its study in June, Olney said, LAMAP hopes to 
unite up to 15 unions in a regionwide organizing campaign that would target 
entire industries within the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 If successful, the campaign could boost economic development and uplift entire 
communities, said UCLA professor Gilda Haas, who will oversee the study. Since 
the 1992 riots, Haas said, city leaders have proposed a variety of remedies, 
including small business loans, training and educational assistance, to address 
economic and social ills in Los Angeles. Now, she said, leaders should work to 
change industrial employment policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have 700,000 manufacturing workers and they have poor working 
conditions and wages, that's going to affect the communities they live in," 
Haas said. "So if you're going to talk about rebuilding L.A., you have to start 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Civic leaders such as Huntington Park Mayor Ric Loya and Bell Councilman 
George Cole, once an officer for United Steelworkers Local 1845 and a former 
worker at Bethlehem Steel, a plant that employed 2,000 when it closed in 1983, 
have endorsed the LAMAP plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think for the first time we're going to have people look at economic 
development throughout our community," Cole said. "And I'm excited about the 
organizing part because we have so many sweatshops and so much exploitation of 
people who don't have a voice in the manufacturing industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Some economists warn that LAMAP's plan could backfire, forcing industry out of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "My personal guess is that organizing would contribute to the departure of at 
least some companies," said Ed Lawler, a USC professor of management and 
organization. ". . . The win-win argument is that if you uplift your work force 
with good wages and good jobs, you create a positive economic cycle. But there 
are some kinds of (low-skilled) work that don't lend themselves to that sort of 
scenario and can be done cheaper in Mainland China or somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 The Southeast area alone has lost more than 2,000 jobs in the past year, 
despite labor movement efforts to preserve them. But Olney rebuts any argument 
that the labor movement is dead, that companies may flee the city to avoid the 
higher costs of union labor or that immigrant workers are too hard to organize. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County is "the industrial heartland" of the United States, he 
said, home to 717,000 manufacturing jobs, nearly twice the number of any other 
county in the nation, according to UCLA analysts. "The much-ballyhooed death of 
manufacturing in Los Angeles is largely a myth," Olney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he acknowledges that the number of manufacturing jobs in the county 
has declined from 924,000 in 1979 to 671,200 in 1993, he points out that, 
according to UCLA analysts, most losses were in the durable goods industry -- 
products such as steel, rubber and automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs in non-durable goods -- light manufacturing such as the garment industry 
that LAMAP hopes to target -- stayed almost level, decreasing by only about 
7,500 jobs in the same period, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been some very innovative (organizing) campaigns that speak well 
of the future," Sickler added, referring to the successful 1990 Justice for 
Janitors campaign that won a labor agreement for 1,000 workers and the 1992 
strike of 4,000 mostly Latino drywall carpenters that in some cases tripled 
wages. LAMAP's strategy will be to target manufacturers of non-durable goods 
that have demonstrated a need or a preference to stay in Los Angeles, Olney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Olney: "We have to be cold and calculating about what (manufacturing) 
sectors can support higher wages and benefits without becoming insolvent but 
optimistic in the sense that organizing workers has to be done with big 
thinking. That's the only way to create a social movement."

 Along the stretch of Burlington Avenue between 3rd and 6th streets, young men 
wearing pagers loiter warily on the sidewalk, their eyes darting from side to 
side as they boldly approach slow-moving cars with whispered offers of 
narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
 People who live there say that gangs control the street, and their power is 
evident in the graffiti covering almost every building, fence and wall.  
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, a trash-filled vacant lot just south of tiny Maryland Avenue 
served as a hub for the neighborhood's illicit activities, from drug 
transactions and consumption to prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 But little by little, a group of local residents is wresting control of the 
lot from the street's rougher elements. And as soon as they can get a fence put 
in, they plan to turn the neighborhood's most blighted spot into its brightest 
-- a community garden and playground. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping we can create a safe place for kids, away from all the drugs and 
gangs," said Maria, a neighbor who preferred not to give her last name. A 
native of Guatemala, she raised her two children -- now college graduates -- in 
an apartment next to the future garden, which she has volunteered to help 
maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 "When my children were growing up, they didn't have to deal with all this," 
she said. "But it's more dangerous for kids these days. We want them to have 
something they can do, so that even if they have to see the gangs and the drug 
activity, they don't have to participate." 
</P>
<P>
 The lot on which the garden is slowly taking shape was once the site of a home 
where an elderly couple lived and cared for neighborhood children, including 
Maria's. But the house burned down more than a decade ago, and the lot has been 
vacant since. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, the lot's owners, who live out of town but were tired of 
receiving complaints about goings-on at the site, contacted Rampart Division 
police about offering the property for community use, said Nola Marie Mott, a 
neighbor who is also a member of More Advocates for Safe Homes in Los Angeles, 
a Westlake-based community improvement group. 
</P>
<P>
 Mott's group had been involved in an unsuccessful attempt last year to acquire 
a lot at 6th Street and Shatto Place for a community garden. Rampart policeman 
David Bachman, aware of the group's failed effort, mentioned the new lot to 
them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joined by several other local residents, Mott's group managed to negotiate a 
deal with the owners to lease the property on a yearly basis for $1 a month, 
provided they maintain it. A similar deal was struck with the owner of a 
smaller adjacent property that makes up the remainder of the vacant site. 
</P>
<P>
 If the owners ever decide to develop, Mott said, the gardeners will be given 
60 days' notice to vacate. But, for now, those putting the garden together plan 
to use the land as best they can. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're planning to have 25 plots, a communal shade area with picnic tables, a 
composting area and a play area," said David Ceaser, a volunteer helping the 
group, as he planted a sapling at a recent garden kickoff ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he lives in Montebello, Ceaser learned of the garden project through 
his girlfriend, Carrie Johnston, an Echo Park resident who works with Mott. 
</P>
<P>
 Experienced in volunteer work, Ceaser and Johnston have helped the garden 
group acquire donations of labor and materials. So far, they have made contact 
with the Los Angeles Conservation Corps, which donated the tree. 
</P>
<P>
 The corps agreed to till the land once the area is fenced in, Ceaser said. In 
the meantime, the couple are working to have seeds, plants and other materials 
donated. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding someone to donate a fence remains an obstacle to really getting the 
garden started, he said. Afraid that local ruffians will destroy the fruits of 
their labor, neighbors have been reluctant to begin planting without one.  
</P>
<P>
 Already, gang members have tagged an incomplete mural on the retaining wall at 
the rear of the property that was begun by neighborhood children the day of the 
tree-planting ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 The vandalized section had not yet been painted, but the group would like to 
ensure that the completed section of the mural does not get tagged as well. So 
until the fence is up, they have no plans to paint over the graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we're trying not to antagonize the gangs," Mott said. "They own 
the street, we don't. We wouldn't want to see the tree chopped down, or the 
kids' mural defaced." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the group realizes that a fence won't guarantee peace between 
gangsters and gardeners, they are hopeful that once the fence is up, the mural 
is complete and the garden is under way, gangbangers will have a little more 
respect for their efforts and let their work stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure once we get it fenced, we'll still have some problems," Mott said. 
"But there could be such a difference on this street."

<P>
 After two years of fires, shootings, drug activity, transient squatting, an 
ongoing lawsuit against the owners by the state and innumerable headaches to 
neighboring residents and merchants, the abandoned building once known as the 
"Hope House" at 843 S. Bonnie Brae Street has finally met the wrecking ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Demolition crews worked to tear down the three-story, 22-unit structure last 
week, formerly a halfway house for indigent adults. Abandoned in 1992, the 
building had become a haven for thugs, drug pushers, addicts and several 
transients who used it as shelter, despite several attempts by the city to 
board the place up. 
</P>
<P>
 Without plumbing or electricity, the building's illegal occupants used the 
alley behind the building and an adjacent lot as a dumping ground for trash, 
clothing, spent syringes and human waste. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was horrible," said Bertha Wooldridge, whose family has owned a hardware 
store near the building for 15 years. "They would just throw everything in 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Police reports indicate that in the three months between March and August of 
this year, three dead bodies were found in the building. There was also one 
criminal homicide, one assault with a deadly weapon, one robbery, one attempted 
robbery and a recovered stolen vehicle, all on the same property.  
</P>
<P>
 "That was one of the worst nuisance locations I have ever seen," said Mary 
Clare Molidor, a lawyer with the city attorney's office assigned to the city's 
FALCON narcotics abatement unit. "You could literally smell the property half a 
block away." 
</P>
<P>
 Fires were also a problem, said David Marquez, a deputy for Councilman Mike 
Hernandez. In the time the building sat abandoned, numerous fires were reported 
there, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit by the state against the former owners, who lost the property in 
court last year, stems from an alleged misuse of several million dollars in 
state-approved loans. Although the lawsuit did not make an issue of the 
building's status as a nuisance, the state decided to tear it down after a 
court-appointed receiver could not cope with the problems that came with the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 "The receiver just couldn't control it any longer," said an attorney, who 
would not give his name, working on the case for the San Francisco firm of 
England and Belote, which is representing the state. "It had no redeeming 
value, so we decided to do the neighborhood a favor and get rid of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless outreach workers have frequented the property over the past two 
weeks, attempting to inform the many transients who made the building their 
home about shelters and rehabilitation programs. Their attempts have met with 
only small success. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made contact with some of them, but only three wanted services," said 
David Bryan, a team leader with the Los Angeles Homeless Service Authority. 
"The rest just scattered." LESLIE BERESTEIN

 As " El Diablo, " Ben Chavez laughs and prompts characters in a play to listen 
to their worst instincts, to disrespect and harm each other. 
</P>
<P>
 He moves through the play bringing forth its tragic end, when one of the main 
characters dies after beating up his ex-girlfriend, drinking and overdosing on 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Performed by students at Mujeres y Hombres Nobles, an alternative high school 
run by the County Office of Education, the play will commemorate Dia de los 
Muertos, Wednesday, and help the school celebrate its first anniversary with an 
open house. 
</P>
<P>
 The students will perform at the school, 1260 S. Monterey Pass Road, from 2 to 
5 p.m. and then at Self-Help Graphics, 3802 Cesar E. Chavez Ave., from 5:30 to 
6:30 p.m. Students will also exhibit artwork and perform dances and music at 
the open house and at Self-Help. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is to be able to share with their parents and the school the work 
they've been doing here because it's not just academic," said drama teacher 
Olivia Chumacero.  
</P>
<P>
 Mujeres y Hombres Nobles offers independent study for students who have 
dropped out of other high schools or are on probation or pregnant. For many, it 
is their last chance to earn their high school diplomas. 
</P>
<P>
 The drama students came up with their own plot to the play, based on 
relationships they have experienced or observed.  
</P>
<P>
 One student, Mayra Reyes, 15, who plays the new girlfriend in the story who 
suffers from the jealousy of an ex-girlfriend, will wear a sweater belonging to 
her ex-boyfriend who was shot and killed last Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
 Reynoldo Ramirez, 14, who plays the main character, Nano, talks about the 
forces of " La Muerte ," death, and " El Diablo ," the devil, who push and pull 
his character throughout the play. 
</P>
<P>
 " La Muerte wants to take him and the devil wants his soul," Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This came out of a discussion of what they wanted to do," Chumacero said. 
"They improvised on the scenes and made it into a script format. It's their 
manner of speaking and coming from their viewpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 The students made masks that they will paint to portray their characters and 
set them on an altar for the play, like the sugar skulls placed on altars for 
the Day of the Dead, All Soul's Day, which in many Latin American cultures is 
observed as a day of remembering those who have passed away. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school's focus is on Chicano and Latino culture because that's who most 
of our students are," said Consuelo F. Norte, who teaches theater, art and 
culture. "We want to give them a sense of who they are." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the students' presentations, Self-Help Graphics will also hold 
its traditional Dia de los Muertos celebration Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The daylong festivities, from 3 to 9 p.m., will include an exhibit of more 
than 100 artists who have created works for the holiday, poetry reading, 
comedy, music, food and crafts.  
</P>
<P>
 Admission is free.

 The Eastside Boys and Girls Club will soon organize games and other 
after-school activities for young people at the Casa Maravilla Housing Project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boys and Girls Club will use a $50,000 grant from Kaiser Permanente and 
$25,000 from the Gilder Foundation for the program aimed at the housing 
development's approximately 1,500 youths between age 7 and 17, said Gil Silva, 
executive director and program director. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which is expected to begin the second week of December, will be 
designed for latchkey children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal is to provide an alternative to the kids other than the streets," 
Silva said. "We don't want any negative influences. We want to give them 
positive influences. If kids are given a choice, they're going to make the 
right choice." 
</P>
<P>
 The club, at 324 N. McDonnell Ave., is just over two blocks from the Cesar E. 
Chavez Avenue housing project, but many of the youth do not belong to the Boys 
and Girls Club because gang territories restrict them from crossing into 
certain areas. Silva said he hopes the center courtyard at the 504-unit housing 
development will be neutral territory so the children can participate. 
</P>
<P>
 The club will provide about four adults to set up and supervise games and arts 
and crafts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eastside Boys and Girls Club of Los Angeles was started 43 years ago and 
has 1,800 members. MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: HIGHLAND PARK; CENTER TO OFFER PARENTING CLASSES 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Northeast Community Clinic will begin a free class Thursday that aims to 
teach parents how to better raise their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Farias, who has taught such courses for 14 years, will conduct the 
classes from 10 to 11:30 a.m. on Thursdays for the next 10 weeks at the 
Highland Park Family Resource Center, 840 N. Avenue 66. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who have taken his class improve their discipline techniques, 
communicate better with their children and have even become more active in 
their children's education, Farias said. In these families, there is now less 
yelling and physical punishment and more open communication, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As participants get more comfortable with the class and its doctrine, many 
times they draw on their experiences to suggest remedies to other parents, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started a group for the first time, a lot of the parents were shy and 
reserved. It was the first time they were participating in that type of 
program," Farias said. "After awhile you start seeing that they got more 
articulate and they started talking about their personal lives more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now when I go out to different schools, I notice that the parents are the 
leaders themselves," Farias said. "They're out there working with parent groups 
in their schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Often, parents realize that the methods their own parents used could now be 
defined as abuse, Farias said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to hear a lot of horror stories about how parents were abused, 
emotionally and physically, and you can see that they're still scarred. It's 
still fresh in many cases," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group focuses on four points: setting rules about what kind of behavior is 
acceptable and what duties the child must do around the house; implementing 
those rules with good supervision; being consistent, and providing an abundance 
of love and affection. 
</P>
<P>
 The classes are sponsored by the Northeast Community Clinic, the Latino Family 
Preservation Project, El Centro Del Pueblo and the Los Angeles Unified School 
District.

<TEXT>
<P>
 When James Muse learned that Prince Charles planned to visit his class at the 
Toyota Automotive Training Center, the first thought that popped into his mind 
was, "Why?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't understand why he'd come here, to the inner city," said Muse, a 
genial man dressed in the customary blue work clothes of center trainees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of all the places he could visit in Los Angeles, why would he come here? . . 
. But thinking about it, I guess I'm pretty proud we were chosen." 
</P>
<P>
 Muse and his fellow classmates will get the rare chance to meet the Prince of 
Wales on Tuesday, when he and his royal entourage will make a pit stop at the 
training center at 3833 S. Crenshaw Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The news came as something of a shock to most of the 14 students who will be 
present, who say that although the heir to the British throne is hardly part of 
their lunch break conversations, the prospect of entertaining an 
internationally known figure is indeed exciting.  
</P>
<P>
 "I hope he's friendly," Muse said with a laugh after learning that the prince 
plans to tour the facility and question his class, the brake and suspension 
students, about their work. "He might even pay attention to what we're doing 
and learn something." 
</P>
<P>
 The 2-year-old center, operated jointly by Toyota and the Los Angeles Urban 
League, has trained about 150 students in auto repair, including tuneups, smog 
exams, brakes and suspensions, and exhaust systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Its high percentage of job placement in a relatively short period of time -- 
all members of the last graduating class found full-time employment -- caught 
the attention of Prince Charles' delegation, Toyota spokeswoman Nancy Hubbell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the British Consulate toured the center last summer and were 
impressed enough to return two months ago and settle on it as an official stop 
during the prince's Los Angeles visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prince Charles has a real interest in vocational schools and educational 
programs," Hubbell said. "The automotive training center seemed like a good 
example to (the British Consulate) of what's working here in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Center General Manager Joe Saia said that although he feels honored to be paid 
a royal visit, he is not planning on doing anything special. Prince Charles "is 
coming here to see us ," he said. "We have more to offer him than he has to 
offer us. . . . We're putting people to work. He can take what he sees here and 
duplicate it in other industries, other countries." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Parr, who was chosen to present the prince with a special honorary 
degree, said he is somewhat used to rubbing elbows with the politically famous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met Bill Clinton last year, and that was nice," the Los Angeles resident 
said. Prince Charles is "probably a regular guy who happens to live in a 
fishbowl. . . . The best part of this visit is that it'll open a window on 
what's really going on in the inner city all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Muse agreed, saying that central Los Angeles "isn't all shootings. The center 
is very clean and presentable, no graffiti. It's always that way. People just 
need to see how things are day-to-day here." 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Barraza, in his third week of study, said he never figured on getting an 
audience with such a famous person when he signed up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of excited," he said. "How many chances do you get to meet someone 
like this? Never. . . . I'm lucky to be in this class, at this time." ERIN J.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: LEIMERT PARK; PLANS TAKE SHAPE FOR FARMERS MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A group of Leimert Park merchants is getting a long-awaited project off the 
ground -- and out on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for a weekly farmers market on a one-block stretch of 43rd Street are 
quickly taking shape, spearheaded by Jimmy Dodson, president of the Leimert 
Park Merchants Assn. He expects the market to open before Thanksgiving, pending 
city approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodson, who owns Banjo's Yogurt and Deli at 43rd and Degnan, said the idea for 
a Saturday morning farmers market in Leimert Park had been discussed for a year 
among the association's 14 members before he decided to try to make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been trying to get together projects that will get more pedestrian 
traffic around here," said Dodson, who says that his business has suffered in 
recent months. "But we need something ongoing, not just a daylong festival. . . 
. Leimert Park is a perfect setting because of all the arty businesses. People 
will come to the market and have a reason to linger." 
</P>
<P>
 The project is getting $10,000 in start-up money from Community Build, a 
nonprofit economic development agency that is also a member of the merchants 
association. Dodson said he has so far recruited 20 produce growers and sellers 
from other local farmers markets and through referrals from the Southland 
Certified Farmers Market Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at local high schools with garden projects, including Fremont and 
Crenshaw, have also expressed interest in selling goods. The market will 
operate Saturdays from 7 to 11 a.m. on 43rd Street between Degnan Boulevard and 
Norton Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said he has given the project his initial 
blessing and is meeting with the community-based Crenshaw Neighborhood Planning 
Board to ensure broad public support for the project before he brings it before 
the City Council for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "I welcome the idea, particularly since it will be helpful to the Leimert Park 
community in terms of revitalization," Ridley-Thomas said. "The area is going 
to see a lot of growth in the near future. . . . This is just one of the things 
that'll be happening." ERIN J. AUBRY

 When Rachele Lozzi began planning art shows for her Downtown gallery, she 
wanted to capture Los Angeles' cultural and historical richness. This month's 
exhibit, "Origins/Transitions," explores the diversity of Asian and Asian 
American experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen artists of Japanese, Chinese and Korean descent display a spectrum of 
perspectives on art, history and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having all these artists together really gave me a sense of culture and 
cultural history," Lozzi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lozzi chose works in a broad range of mediums, from traditional Chinese brush 
painting to computerized paintings.  
</P>
<P>
 Pat Tom, a third-generation Chinese American, returned to her cultural roots 
when she took up brush painting, an ancient form of Chinese art.  
</P>
<P>
 "As I was learning Chinese calligraphy and how to control the paintbrush, I 
was also learning the culture of China," Tom said. 
</P>
<P>
 With swift strokes of her paintbrush, she created a three-dimensional collage 
of a single lotus in shades of black and gray. Using Chinese ink chips in 
water, Tom added details to the veins of leaves hanging off a persimmon tree.  
</P>
<P>
 "My paintings are very quiet. With Western art, you need to stand back. With 
mine and other Chinese art, people have to come close to the painting to see 
the details, the small hidden images," Tom said. 
</P>
<P>
 Li Huai said she uses radiant reds in her bold paintings depicting images of 
her personal struggles with American culture, including isolation, seduction 
and confusion. On a three-paneled oil painting, stretching across the gallery's 
center wall, the Beijing-born artist and UC San Diego professor said she tries 
to defy the softness typically associated with Asian art. The work uses 
blood-red hues to evoke seduction, confusion and isolation in her bicultural 
experience, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 A first-generation Korean American, June Choi paints portraits of fictitious 
characters from novellas she's read or some of her own short stories. Using 
charcoal, acrylic paints and sometimes tar, her near life-sized paintings play 
with mermaid figures and a robotic, faceless version of Barbie.  
</P>
<P>
 A politically and socially conscious Grace Amemiya said she discusses her 
internal struggles with gender roles and environmental issues through her 
printmaking and etchings. She said her work visualizes an Asian woman's 
frustrations and inner strengths, unrequited love and the dichotomy of 
Catholicism and Buddhism in her background.  
</P>
<P>
 "My work is themed on life. I'm always carrying the array of emotions in my 
work and I hope people look at it and interact with the messages," Amemiya 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Luu, an independent filmmaker and performance artist, read his poetry at 
the gallery and crossed racial and sexual lines by performing a series of Asian 
American characters. Luu said he enjoys exploring his heritage and personifying 
the ordinary idiosyncrasies of Asian American males. 
</P>
<P>
 "People always expect Asian Americans to always be in pain. I portray the 
ordinary struggles of screwed up love, sexuality. People usually have a problem 
with Asian American men who are sexual," Luu said. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit runs through Nov. 5 at the Rachele Lozzi Gallery at the Los 
Angeles Hilton and Towers, 930 Wilshire Blvd.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: CHINATOWN; COALITION OF GROUPS DENOUNCE PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A coalition of Chinese American organizations denounced Proposition 187 
Tuesday as an "anti-difference" measure that will pit Californians against each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition of eight groups, including Chinese American lawyers and 
associations for women and the elderly, said at a news conference at the 
Chinese American Consolidated Benevolent Office that the measure will 
stigmatize all non-Anglo ethnic groups as foreign and illegal.  
</P>
<P>
 "America is a country of immigrants. Asians and Hispanics should not have to 
prove that they are more American than anyone else," said Roger Yee, a member 
of Chinese Americans United for Self Empowerment, a group of business and 
community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the measure, which would deny most public services to illegal 
immigrants, say they are not opposed to legal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a matter of where you come from, but how you're coming here," 
pro-187 campaign chairman Ron Prince said in response to the coalition's 
comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Chi Mui, chairman of the Asian Pacific American Education Commission of the 
Los Angeles Unified School District, called the state initiative's plan to deny 
illegal immigrant children access to education unconstitutional. He also 
criticized its provision requiring educators to verify the citizenship of 
students and their parents and to report those here illegally to the 
immigration service. 
</P>
<P>
 If Proposition 187 passes, the Los Angeles Unified School District estimates 
it may lose federal funding that helps pay for reduced-cost meal programs and 
specialized teaching programs for at-risk youths. Mui, whose two sons attend 
Castelar Elementary School in Chinatown, said about 60% of the school's 1,000 
students depend on meal plans.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's a lot of money, especially when we don't even have enough money for 
pencils and books for some kids," Mui said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187's supporters deny that the measure is unconstitutional and say 
public school funding is not in jeopardy, if the courts uphold the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Lee of the Organization of Chinese American Women said Proposition 187 
poses special problems for women who are here illegally and are dependent on 
their husbands. Some men, she said, might threaten their wives with deportation 
to keep them subservient. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, a counselor for battered women, added that others might be reluctant to 
use health clinics and social services that require verification of 
citizenship.  
</P>
<P>
 The measure has stirred anxiety and misunderstanding among Chinese senior 
citizens who are legal residents, said Deborah Ching, director of Chinatown 
Service Center. Because many cannot speak English, they misconstrue the 
proposition as an anti-immigrant measure that will deny them medical benefits 
and Social Security, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other panelists expressed concern that the proposition will discourage Pacific 
Rim businesses from investing in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Chan of the Self Empowerment group said: "There would be an exodus of 
businesses here if Chinese Americans are unjustly discriminated against. 
Corporations outside the state will be reluctant to enter or invest in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 Partly in response to concerns over the measure, some Chinese American 
organizations have launched voter education and registration programs. 
According to polls conducted by Asian Pacific Americans for a New L.A., most 
registered Asian American voters oppose the initiative. The group's 
coordinator, David Monkawa, said a poll of 1,459 households found 805 opposed 
to Proposition 187, 123 in support and 492 undecided. TINA NGUYEN

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; WALTERS WANTS BLACKS ON EL PUEBLO PANEL

<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilwoman Rita Walters has proposed expanding the city 
panel that oversees operations of the historic El Pueblo de Los Angeles to 
include blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters is seeking to add two seats to the seven-member El Pueblo de Los 
Angeles Historic Monument Authority Commission, which manages the park around 
Olvera Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is of the utmost importance that the monument reflect the tradition of 
racial diversification that is inherent in the history of the city," Walters 
wrote in proposing the expansion.  
</P>
<P>
 The board consists of five Latinos, a Chinese American and an Italian 
American. 
</P>
<P>
 Some commissioners questioned whether the expansion is necessary. "It's good 
to get the African American perspective," said Commissioner Stewart Kwoh. "But 
I also think we can provide that perspective with the current commission." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Lydia Lopez said she supports the councilwoman's motion, but said 
Walters needs to address the racial composition of other local bodies as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "To try to fix this challenge, we have to make sure every other commission is 
also representative of the city," Lopez said. "I hope she uses this same energy 
to look at other commissions."  
</P>
<P>
 Formed in August, the commission is seeking a general manager and staff 
members to manage the birthplace of Los Angeles. Members of the Olvera 
Merchants Assn. are concerned that a larger board may delay the commission's 
agenda and add to its bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want it to be less formal and more progressive," said Viven Bonzo, an 
Olvera Street merchant. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council's Arts, Health and Humanities Committee will consider 
Walters' proposal at a future hearing. TINA NGUYEN

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; OFFICIALS DENY PLEA TO REOPEN SWAP MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LAVIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with neighborhood complaints that it was an eyesore, the swap meet at 
the southeast corner of Vernon and Central avenues has lost a battle with the 
city to continue operating. 
</P>
<P>
 The city permanently shut down the open-air bazaar four weeks ago, denying 
property owner Rodrigo Lazo and swap meet manager Juan Castaneda a renewal of 
conditional-use permits. A recent follow-up meeting at Los Angeles City 
Councilwoman Rita Walters' office to reach a compromise was unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are backing up our community, which said the swap meet was unsightly," 
said Jan Perry, Walters' chief of staff and the mediator at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit Vernon-Central Neighborhood Housing Services and the United 
Block Participation Involvement, two groups of residents seeking to spruce up 
the area, claimed that the six-year-old swap meet contributed to blight in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of trash being thrown into the next lot, which makes the 
community look ugly," said Richard Marshall, 72, a member of the United Block 
group. "We are just trying to make the neighborhood look better . . . That's 
why the vending needs to be controlled." 
</P>
<P>
 The closing of the swap meet has left about 20 people out of work, said 
Castaneda, including himself and his wife. They earned about $80 to $100 a day 
selling baby clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now no one is working. Most of the vendors are going to the Carta de 
Oro meet on San Pedro and Slauson, but only on weekends," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 For 52-year-old Piofilo Mata and his wife, it has been just as tough. Mata 
said that instead of selling secondhand clothes for $60 to $80 a day, he and 
his wife collect recyclable items for $7 to $15 a day. "If it wasn't for the 
kindness of our landlord, we wouldn't have a place to stay," said Mata, who 
said he's been saving pennies to pay the rent. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting, city officials and outside organizations offered alternatives 
for the vendors and for Lazo. But neither the vendors nor the property owner 
are pleased with the suggestions, which included seeking loans to develop the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do they have to pressure me with what I do with the property," said Lazo, 
who's owned the parcel for 10 years. "Instead of giving incentives to people, 
they put you down. South-Central is not Beverly Hills, so we have to plan and 
do business accordingly. An open-air swap meet is something good for the area. 
It might not be good for Beverly Hills, but we're not in Beverly Hills."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: COMMERCE; HOUSING PROJECT FOR DISABLED OPENS

<TEXT>
<P>
 There's already a waiting list for TELACU Gardens, a new affordable-housing 
project for disabled adults. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit East Los Angeles Community Union known by the acronym TELACU 
built the 24-unit project at 7131 Gage Ave. through a $2-million grant from the 
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The city, which provided the 
land, contributed an additional $142,000 for balconies, sidewalks and other 
amenities. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this type of successful partnership, TELACU is proud to put its 
signature on another high-quality development," TELACU President David 
Lizarraga said at a recent dedication ceremony. "We're proud to be part of a 
shared mission to provide affordable housing for our citizens in need." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20 people are on a waiting list to move in. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 24 current residents have never had the opportunity to live on 
their own, officials said. Once they signed up for the program, they waited for 
more than a year to be accepted. The tenants, who moved into the units in 
September, include a deaf college student, six blind people and three people 
who use wheelchairs.  
</P>
<P>
 Most rely on government support to survive. HUD provides subsidies that limit 
tenants' rental contribution to one-third of their income. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the units have lowered sinks and counters and special "roll-in" 
showers with benches. All units have emergency alarms in the bedroom and 
bathroom that allow tenants to call the two resident managers provided by 
TELACU. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is exciting because there's a real feeling of community here," said Edna 
Pena, one of the resident managers. "I can relate to everyone who has moved 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 Pena, 27, who is hearing-impaired, communicates in sign language, English and 
some Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 The East Los Angeles Community Union is a nonprofit community development 
corporation. Its affordable housing division has built or is developing nearly 
1,000 housing units for senior citizens and the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 This is TELACU's second complex for the disabled under the HUD program. The 
first project was the renovation of a 40-unit building in Downtown Los Angeles, 
TELACU Plaza South Park. 
</P>
<P>
 This is also the third TELACU project that is located in and partially funded 
by Commerce. The first, a 75-unit apartment complex for low-income senior 
citizens, is across the street from TELACU Gardens, and the second, eight 
single-family houses built in 1992, is also nearby. SIMON ROMERO

<TEXT>
<P>
 Louis Shephard, city administrator since 1987, has announced he will retire at 
the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not want to work as long and hard as I have been," Shephard, 61, said 
of his decision to retire in December, shortly before his 62nd birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is interviewing 34 candidates from throughout California to fill 
the $131,000-a-year post. 
</P>
<P>
 The city administrator takes care of the day-to-day responsibilities for the 
city, which has undergone profound economic, demographic and political changes 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city administrator has a large amount of power," said Francisco Leal, the 
Commerce city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "The administrator usually takes the lead on development issues and is very 
influential when it comes to hiring and firing personnel," Leal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shephard has been in public service since 1957, when he took an administrative 
intern position in San Leandro after graduating from UC Berkeley. He received 
his master's degree in political science there in 1959 while working for the 
city of Fremont. 
</P>
<P>
 Before coming to Commerce, he served as city administrator in Delano, San 
Pablo and Signal Hill and was director of the Pasadena Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lou's been a great force in Commerce since he arrived," said Ruth Aldaco, a 
former councilwoman. 
</P>

THE GREAT BLIGHT WAY; ALLEYS HAVE BECOME A MAGNET FOR ILLEGAL DUMPING AND 
CRIME. A CITY PILOT PROJECT HOPES TO CHANGE THAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 THEY WERE ONCE THE KEY TO LOS ANGELES' PRISTINE front yards, allowing cars to 
quietly pull into back-yard garages, obscuring utility poles from view and 
hiding trash cans away for pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city's labyrinthine alleys have grown into eyesores, longtime illegal 
dumping grounds for outside haulers and careless residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have become lairs where prostitutes turn tricks on discarded sofas, 
thieves escape from police, crack addicts score drugs and the homeless find 
shelter amid the debris. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles spends about $6 million a year to clean them up, much of it in 
South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty percent of all alley cleaning occurs in the 8th and 9th City Council 
districts, represented by Mark Ridley-Thomas and Rita Walters, respectively. 
Some alleys there are cleaned up to 15 times a year -- five times the average, 
city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people come in trucks and they don't give a darn if you hear them or not, 
they just dump -- rugs, mattresses, automobile tires. They got a whole fire 
hazard down there," said Alice Boutte, 79. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutte's house in the 9100 block of Wall Street is next to one of the city's 
worst alleys, where debris is piled so high some garages are hopelessly 
barricaded. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 30 years, (the city) has been saying they're going to block this (alley) 
off, but I don't ever see it," complained Boutte, who has lived in the 
neighborhood for 37 years. 
</P>
<P>
 That's about to change. Boutte's street is part of the city's pilot project to 
close off half a dozen problem alleys in South-Central and turn them over to 
property owners for community gardens and recreational use. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to cut down on the city's exorbitant cleaning costs and eliminate 
the nuisance the alleys have become to residents, said Bob Hayes, public 
information officer for the Board of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
 To help with the project, students from Cal Poly Pomona surveyed 1,150 of the 
3,600 alleys in the 8th and 9th districts last year, 
</P>
<P>
 identified a dozen "nuisance alleys" in need of immediate closure and designed 
alternative uses for residents to choose from. The designs include walkways, 
vegetable gardens, sitting areas, barbecues and recycling bins. 
</P>
<P>
 Alley conditions have never been as bad as they are now, residents and city 
officials agree. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent morning, only two out of nine alleys in Melinda Stewart's 
neighborhood, near 92nd and Towne streets, could be driven through. The rest 
were clogged with waist-high weeds, carpets, tires, couches and trash. Rats and 
roaches crawled freely through some of the piles and sometimes made their way 
into homes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Midnight dumpers" are the major cause of the problem, public works officials 
say. Small tire shops, contractors and waste haulers -- business people who 
operate on thin profit margins -- dump behind homes to avoid costly landfill 
fees. Residents add to the debris with sofas, TVs, cribs, car batteries and 
other bulky or hazardous objects that city garbage trucks won't pick up. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart even recalled seeing a man dump urine and feces from the toilet of his 
mobile home in the alley behind her neighbor's home, just two blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stench from the urine would get so bad that I would just keep praying for 
it to rain and wash some of it away," said Stewart, 56. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart's block club has already signed a petition calling for the city to 
close the alleys in the neighborhood. The 91st-93rd Street block club is 
shopping around for gates to make it permanent and has already selected designs 
that include a trellis, walkways made from old railroad ties, gardens and play 
areas for children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, the children have no place to play except in the front of the 
house," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents must pay for gates to block their alleys and assume responsibility 
for maintenance and liability of the city-owned property once landscaping is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
 As Stewart's block club has done, a majority of homeowners have to agree to 
the project and raise the money for the gates, which could cost at least 
$2,500. Hayes said the city will draft landscaping plans and find donated 
materials -- such as benches and railroad ties for walkways -- from city 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 Four to six months after the alleys are cleaned, Hayes said, the 
transformation of them should be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that I think everyone will benefit from all around," said 
Herbert Ferberow, a planning lecturer at Cal Poly and supervisor of the student 
group that studied the alleys. "The city is looking to save some money and the 
people are looking to regain a sense of community and get this land in shape." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two alleys -- stretching from 90th to 92nd streets and from Towne and San 
Pedro streets -- were the first to be cleaned for the program and poles were 
temporarily erected to prohibit dumping. Street maintenance workers cleaned a 
third alley -- the one next to Boutte's property -- on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the demonstration alleys," Hayes says. "I want people to see that 
it can be done and to see what a difference it can make." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of closing alleys is not a new one. In the 1970s, the city allowed 
property owners throughout Los Angeles to eliminate alleys altogether by 
constructing fences down the center of them, increasing the size of their back 
yards. But homeowners never took the city up on its offer. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, the city engineer proposed simply closing the alleys to public 
access, but at the time the council rejected the idea. The same proposal was 
made again in 1993. This time the council approved it. 
</P>
<P>
 Half a dozen block clubs have jumped at the alley conversion proposal, hoping 
to end years of living behind festering mounds of garbage and fire hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 But the idea doesn't sit well with everyone. A few homeowners say it will be 
too expensive for senior citizens and others on fixed incomes since it is the 
residents who have to dip into their pockets for the gates. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were quite a few people ready to go along with the conversion project 
until they found out they had to pay for these wrought-iron gates that can run 
anywhere from $2,500 to $5,000. That's about $300 to $350 per household," said 
Melodie Dove, community organizer for Concerned Citizens of South Central L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Dove, who heads a coalition of 45 block clubs in the Vernon Central Block Club 
Council, said the clubs favor any plan to clean up the alleys. But many 
residents believe that the city should fund the cost of the gates since they 
will be saving money by not having to clean the alleys. 
</P>
<P>
 Layvonia Miller, president of the 34th Street block club, said the city should 
revive the idea of deeding the alleys to property owners, who would move their 
property lines back. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes it even more painful for some homeowners to live with the blight is 
remembering what it used to be like 30 and 40 years ago, when the alleys were a 
convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart remembers seeing city inspectors patrolling the streets in the 1960s 
and citing residents who left small piles of weeds or a rusty old chair in 
their back yards for too long. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But things changed. First people started throwing bottles and cans in the 
alley, she said, then tree branches or pieces of wood. The problem now is so 
bad that many South-Central alleys are inaccessible to firetrucks and police 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pileup of trash in the alleys is a real concern for us and a concern for 
the Fire Department," said Capt. Larry Gloebel of the Police Department's 77th 
Street Division. "What happens if there's an emergency at the back of the house 
and a (fire department) truck or (squad) car can't get there because of the 
garbage in the alley?" 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents have given up on getting to their garages from the alleys. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Walker hasn't walked into the alley behind her house to check her garage 
in five years. Walker, who is in her 70s, padlocked the garage inside and out 
because of repeated break-ins. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "As fast as they can clean it up, there's someone waiting to dump right there 
again," said Walker, a 35-year resident of the area. "We never had a problem 
with the alleys when I moved here. Never a problem with people dumping or cars 
being pulled in and being stripped." 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 1, about 2,000 volunteers armed with pale blue garbage bags combed 
through alleys throughout South-Central and the rest of the city as part of the 
Police Department's annual Operation Sparkle campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three weeks later, though, on a drive through the 77th Street Division 
with Officer Keith Thomas, some of the bags were still lying in alleys waiting 
to be picked up by city crews. And new piles of trash and couches were back in 
the middle of other alleys. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, who lives in the area, is a proponent of simply doing away with the 
alleys. "What use are they for anybody anymore? When I look for a house (to 
buy), I don't look for an alley behind it. . . . Plus it will add a few more 
feet of property for people." 
</P>
<P>
 To keep the alleys in his patrol area clean, Thomas started an Adopt-an-Alley 
program last December. Business owners and residents take responsibility for 
cleaning up alleys and discouraging transients from picking through garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 One alley in the 9100 block of Western Avenue, adopted by the owner of a 
neighboring liquor store, is nearly spotless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would love to have all the alleys adopted by someone. That might be the 
first step in getting rid of the problem," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents who have been battling the growing mounds of trash for years 
are ready to give up because the problem is so out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 Sang Brown, 72, still goes out every now and then with his neighbors on 40th 
Place and Hooper Avenue to pick up trash near his home of 47 years.  
</P>
<P>
 "We try and keep it up a little bit, but if the city can't even keep on top of 
it, I don't expect we could do a real good job trying to keep the dumping 
down," Brown said with an air of defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Farther west, near 42nd Street and Gramercy Place, Wanda Garcia and Thelma 
Jones sift through a torn plastic bag of trash and clothes. There are old Wang 
computer disks and operator manuals, magazines and unopened mail -- all 
addressed to a resident who lives two blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, Garcia and residents in the neighborhood complain that their homes have 
become easy targets for thieves who climb over the walls late at night. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners have asked for Ridley-Thomas' help and are circulating 
petitions to include their alley in the conversion project.  
</P>
<P>
 Recently, a dozen property owners huddled in Garcia's living room to discuss 
converting their alley with Hayes of the Board of Public Works. All were 
willing to forget about their garages if it meant they could feel safer at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is more than willing to have the alley closed up," Garcia said. "And 
they're willing to pay whatever it's going to cost to have that sense of 
security." Nuisance Alleys 
</P>
<P>
 In a novel approach to cleaning up nuisance alleys plagued by crime and 
illegal dumping, the city is closing off at least half a dozen of them in 
South-Central and will turn the city-owned land over to the adjacent land 
property owners for community gardens and other recreational uses. (graphic 
follows) How to Get Alleys Cleaned 
</P>
<P>
 1. Call the field deputy in your council member's office. The representative 
for Council District 9, Kim David, is at 237-1088. Sandra Howell, field deputy 
for Council District 8, can be reached at (213) 485-7616. The information will 
be forwarded to the Board of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Residents will receive a petition to circulate on their block. 
</P>
<P>
 3. The petition should be submitted to a council field deputy, who will send 
it to city engineers along with information regarding how the alleys will be 
maintained and who will be responsible for them. The petition calls for the 
alley to be restricted from public use and closed. However, restriction of the 
alley is revocable by the city or petitioners. 
</P>
<P>
 4. The petition goes to the Board of Public Works for review, and then the 
council's public works committee. Hearings will be scheduled for public 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 5. If the petition passes this process, it goes before the City Council for a 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 6. After final approval, the alleys will be cleaned and barred off with poles. 
Residents have six months to purchase wrought iron gates for permanent closure. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Residents must decide on an architectural plan for the alley conversion and 
sign a form agreeing to a specific schedule for implementing the plan.

BEST FRIENDS -- UNTIL FRIDAY; GARFIELD'S RAMIREZ AND ROOSEVELT'S GALLEGOS WILL 
PLAY IN EAST L.A. CLASSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LAVIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They've been best friends since the 7th grade. Despite going to separate high 
schools over the years, their bonds have steadily grown stronger to the point 
where they're as close as brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Living only three houses away from each other on Siskiyou Street in East Los 
Angeles, the two friends have hung out together since their days at Stevenson 
Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
 On the football field, however, they are as distant as Cain and Abel. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Ramirez is a receiver for the Garfield High football team. His compadre 
Johnny Gallegos is also on the offensive line -- for Roosevelt High. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night their communal ties will break for a few hours as the two will be 
on opposite sides of the field in the East Los Angeles Classic. The friendly 
football game between the two high schools has mushroomed to near biblical 
proportions since the rivalry began in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an event where a crowd of more than 25,000 squeezes into Weingart Stadium 
at East Los Angeles College and 2,000 watch from outside the gates. Close to 
600 others -- cheerleaders, drill team members, bands and the teams themselves 
-- will muster on the football field, each with the same agenda -- to win, no 
matter who is on the other team, friend or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neighbors ask us how we even talk to each other when we go to rival schools, 
especially during the week of the Classic," said Gallegos, 17. "We joke around 
that we are going to kill each other on the field, but we know we're not 
serious." 
</P>
<P>
 Serious or not, with area junior high schools such as Robert Louis Stevenson, 
Hellenbeck, Belvedere and Griffith feeding into Garfield and Roosevelt, the 
rivalry between the two high schools has brought families together on the field 
and in the stands only to pull them apart at kickoff. Husbands have met their 
future wives there. Cousin is pitted against cousin. Some parents are forced 
into shifting alliances, taking half their kids to either side because one went 
to Roosevelt and the other to Garfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to Garfield because all my family went there," said Ramirez, 17, who 
added that his parents met at his school. Similarly, most of Gallegos' 
immediate family went to Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, mixed marriages are not uncommon. Mirna Jimenez was wearing a 
Garfield sweater when she met her husband, Roughrider alum Rodolfo, after the 
1970 encounter -- two years before it was dubbed the Classic. The high school 
sweethearts eventually married. Rodolfo's heirs wear his school's colors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since my son and daughter go to Roosevelt, I sit on Roosevelt's side," said 
Mirna, who jokingly admits to being ostracized around this time of year for 
being a Bulldog. "This year they are supposed to give me a break and let me sit 
on the Garfield side."  
</P>
<P>
 As far as taunting the other side goes, Mirna's 16-year-old daughter Erika, a 
cheerleader for Roosevelt, has her hands full. Her cousin Rudy Burruel, 18, is 
a receiver for the Garfield squad. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's exciting when (Rudy) makes a play, but all the same I yell, 'I want you 
guys to get him hard!"' Erika Jimenez said. If her cousin is nailed in a play, 
he deserves it, she added. "(His teammates) are mean. They tell me I'm a loser 
because we lost last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night's game is the 59th encounter between the two ballclubs. Roosevelt 
leads the series 29-23-6. In the Classic, it's another story. Winning in the 
final seconds of last year's matchup, Garfield is on top 11-10-1, earning the 
Bulldogs bragging rights for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell her 'Yeah! we'll see when the time comes,"' said Burruel, "I get into 
it a lot...it pumps everybody up. But it hasn't gone as far as telling her to 
stay away." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the USC-UCLA rivalry, it's a game that transcends whatever else happens 
during the rest of the season: a victory can make a losing season brighter, or 
taint a winning record. Neither Roosevelt nor Garfield has dominated its 
conference this season. The Roughriders enter the game with a 3-5 record last 
Friday after losing to Jefferson while the Bulldogs bettered their record to 
5-3 after beating Locke. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, each team's records are inconsequential this Friday night. 
Brothers are battling each other over school pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know we grew up really close, but he's on the opposite team, and I'm going 
out there to win," said Ryan Ramirez.

A CHEER FOR FAMILY LOYALTY; TEEN-AGER JOINED RIVAL GARFIELD HIGH TO HONOR SLAIN 
RELATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LAVIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 Jennie Carreon, 15, should have gone to Roosevelt High School like the rest of 
her family. But in memory of her step-uncle Frank Villegas, Carreon switched 
her allegiance to Garfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to graduate from Garfield because he never got a chance to," Carreon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Villegas died from gunshot wounds he received in a drive-by shooting last 
December. The 19-year-old senior was a saxophonist for Garfield's band. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was expected to go to Roosevelt," said Carreon, a sophomore cheerleader 
whose mother, aunts and other uncles all were Roughriders. "When I said I was 
going to Garfield, at first they said no," she recalled. But when they learned 
why she was switching sides, they approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives don't know why Villegas went to Garfield except that "he always 
wanted to be different," Carreon said.  
</P>
<P>
 Carreon said she lacked a strong male role model after her parents divorced. 
She came to look up to Villegas, who encouraged her to go to school and become 
a cheerleader. He took her to football games and played "Stand By Me" for her 
on the saxophone. "I felt like I owed it to him" to graduate from his school, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the switch has been something of a shock to Carreon's mother, Virginia, 
a former captain of the Roosevelt cheerleaders team. 
</P>
<P>
 Before enrolling at Garfield as a sophomore last July, Carreon was debating 
whether to attend a private school in Massachusetts where she had obtained a 
scholarship. Carreon opted to stay in Los Angeles to be close to her family, 
but at first she didn't tell everyone of her decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Carreon also joined the Garfield cheerleading team. In the middle of summer, 
she told her mother that she was on a cheer squad, and her mother assumed it 
was for a club at a nearby park.  
</P>
<P>
 "After practice," Carreon said, "my mom asked to see a couple of my cheers. 
She said, 'Maybe I can help.' " Carreon stunned her mother by chanting, 
"GA-RF-IE-LD, GA-RF-IE-LD." 
</P>
<P>
 "Aren't you cheering for the wrong school?" her mother said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But I eventually got her support," Carreon said, "and she helps me out a lot 
now."

CONGRESS 24TH DISTRICT; CAMPAIGNS SET SIGHTS ON BEILENSON'S RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BUZBEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearing the end of his toughest reelection campaign, U.S. Rep. Anthony C. 
Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) is hoping to persuade voters that he's been 
working on the issues they care about: crime, the economy, immigration and 
health care. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not an easy message to sell. The search for solutions has been painful 
and difficult, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes some time," he said. "It takes some money. It's messy and it's 
complicated." 
</P>
<P>
 And largely ineffectual, says Rich Sybert, Beilenson's Republican challenger. 
Sybert says that if voters take a look at the record of Beilenson and Congress, 
they won't like what they see. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you like what's going on, if you want more of the same, then you should 
vote to keep the guys who are there," Sybert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, he expects voters to act otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the issues Sybert is hammering away at is Beilenson's 1993 vote for 
President Clinton's economic plan, which included a tax increase on high-income 
earners. Beilenson's 24th District, an affluent area that includes Malibu, 
Sherman Oaks and other parts of the San Fernando Valley, ranked ninth among the 
country's 435 congressional districts in the number of voters affected by the 
tax increase, according to the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington 
think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beilenson has been a consistent supporter of the Clinton tax increase and his 
economic approach, which I believe is economically illiterate," Sybert said. 
"He has consistently voted against the interests of the district." 
</P>
<P>
 But Beilenson emphasizes the plan's spending cuts and the deficit reduction 
that resulted. Preliminary estimates by the Clinton Administration show the 
fiscal 1994 deficit to be $203 billion, down from $290.4 billion in 1992, and 
headed for a projected $167.1 billion in the next fiscal year, which began Oct. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan passed by only a one-vote margin. If Sybert had been in Congress, 
Beilenson said, it would not have passed and "we'd have half a trillion dollars 
in additional deficit that we're not going to have." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson also touts other accomplishments of Congress and the Clinton 
Administration: approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the 
National Service Act to put 20,000 young people to work in their communities, 
the Family Leave Act to give workers time off to help care for their families 
and the Brady Law to establish a waiting period on handgun purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson also notes that he wrote a provision of the recently enacted crime 
bill that requires the federal government to reimburse state and local 
governments for the cost of keeping criminal illegal aliens in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time ever, we took some meaningful steps to help solve the 
problem of illegal immigration," Beilenson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Through much of the campaign, Beilenson has positioned himself as an 
independent. In a recent debate Sybert disagreed, saying Beilenson votes with 
the Democratic leadership 90% of the time. Beilenson replied that many of his 
Republican colleagues consider him nonpartisan and fair-minded. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, 42, has been emphasizing his experience as a businessman, not a 
professional politician. Beilenson, 61, is in his ninth term in Congress after 
serving in the state Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never run for office and he's never done anything else," Sybert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson discounts Sybert's business experience. Sybert is president of a 
Santa Barbara-based toy company, but from 1991-93 he was a top aide to Gov. 
Pete Wilson. Before that he spent 13 years working as a lawyer in a large 
downtown Los Angeles law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates have also disagreed sharply on the role of contributions from 
political action committees in the race. Beilenson has long refused to accept 
contributions from PACs, saying they're only special interests trying to buy 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sybert notes that Beilenson does accept financial support from the state 
and national Democratic congressional campaign fund, which takes PAC 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "He takes the same money, but he does so in a way that he can present himself 
as not taking it," Sybert said. "I think it's fundamentally dishonest." 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert has taken an estimated $60,000 in contributions from PACs, including 
donations from three oil-related PACs and food industry-related organizations. 
He said his PAC contributions are a sign of confidence from the business 
community for his support for lowering taxes and cutting government 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Beilenson said Sybert's PAC contributions are a sign of him getting cozy 
with Washington special interests and lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line? As of Sept. 30, the candidates had nearly identical war 
chests. Beilenson's campaign had $208,000 in the bank, while Sybert had 
$204,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does the district offer either candidate a decisive advantage in voter 
registration. Although 50% of the district's voters are registered Democratic 
and 37% are Republican, strategists consider it a swing district because GOP 
voters are traditionally more likely than Democrats to go to the polls and 
support their party's candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the election could hinge not on economic policies or PAC 
contributions, but on voters' moods about the nation and the federal 
government. Sybert said he's been stunned at the level of cynicism and distrust 
he has encountered while campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 "People feel we've got a government that's fundamentally non-responsive to 
their needs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Beilenson said voter discontent has been exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are concerned about the government and the direction the country's 
taking, but I don't find the deep-seated discontent and cynicism," he said.

DECISION '94 / SPECIAL GUIDE TO CALIFORNIA'S ELECTIONS; FINDING A CURE IN A 
YEAR OF ANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If 1992 was the Year of the Woman, 1994 might be the Year of Anger in 
California politics. Anger over crime and illegal immigration. Anger at 
incumbent politicians. Anger at the system itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Something's going on out there. The pollsters and other experts aren't sure 
exactly what it is, or how it will manifest itself at the polls on Election 
Day, Nov. 8. But voter frustration is boiling over. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, when The Times invited a group of undecided voters to talk about the 
elections, this is what they thought about politicians: One said, "I personally 
do not believe they give a damn." Another commented, "Fire them, like you'd 
fire anybody else." A third said, "Somewhere, somehow, the whole system has 
fermented and become corrupt." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no doubt, as well, that the primary lightning rod in California this 
year is illegal immigration, and most specifically, the cost of providing 
services such as health care and education to those who are in California 
without benefit of U.S. citizenship or some other form of legal status. 
</P>
<P>
 Once or twice every generation in California, an issue builds up such momentum 
that it tends to overshadow an entire election. The success or failure of 
candidates may rest on how they deal with the issue -- support it, oppose it 
or, often the most fateful choice of all, try to ride it down the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the case in the mid-1960s with the state open housing law and in 1978 
with Proposition 13, the so-called Property Tax Revolt. This year, it is 
Proposition 187, the initiative to deny state services other than emergency 
medical care to anyone who is in California illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Early polls gave the measure a seemingly overwhelming lead. As the debate 
intensified and enveloped candidates at every level, the gap narrowed. But even 
if it fails to pass, the passions over illegal immigration will continue to 
influence California politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Other currents are swirling around California's campaign season, including a 
supposed Republican surge nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Will 1994 be the year of the anti-politician? Will California voters rise up 
and smite incumbents? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary out there," said a longtime California campaign manager. His voice 
was etched with weary anxiety as his arm gestured symbolically toward a vast, 
unseen California voting populace. 
</P>
<P>
 Much depends on who actually turns out to vote this year. Will huge numbers of 
those who are disenchanted with the political situation feel strongly enough to 
go to the polls to register their protest? Or will they show their disdain for 
the system simply by staying home on Election Day? 
</P>
<P>
 The election of 1994 will determine to a considerable degree what the state's 
governance will be going into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, this is an "off-year" election because the presidency is not at 
stake. But this is the "on-year" for the state as Californians choose their 
governor and other ranking statewide officials, a U.S. senator, 52 members of 
the U.S. House of Representatives and 100 of the 120 members of the 
Legislature, and decide on 10 statewide ballot measures. 
</P>
<P>
 For legislators in office when term limits passed in 1990, this will be the 
last run for their current seats. Already, a large number of lawmakers have 
left the Legislature to run for higher office this year or pursue other career 
paths. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An unusual twist to this campaign is that the contest for the U.S. Senate is 
drawing as much attention as the contest for governor. This is primarily 
because of the challenge of freshman Rep. Mike Huffington, a virtually unknown 
Santa Barbara Republican, to Sen. Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Going into the campaign, Feinstein was one of the state's most popular 
politicians and a heavy favorite to win. But Huffington plunged $20 million or 
more of his personal fortune into the contest, and tapping into the widespread 
anger toward incumbents, made it a nationally watched battle. 
</P>
<P>
 A victory by Gov. Wilson over Democrat Kathleen Brown, after his governorship 
sank to record lows in popularity just two years ago, could put Wilson in the 
middle of speculation about a possible spot on the 1996 national ticket. A 
Brown victory would do the same for her in regard to the first presidential 
election of the new century, in the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again California has become a national laboratory for initiatives. 
Passage of Proposition 187 could trigger movements in other states to end 
public services for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Other controversial ballot measures have been largely overshadowed by the 
strong interest in Proposition 187. Proposition 186 would totally overhaul the 
health care system in the state, replacing it with a state-administered 
"single-payer" plan. And Proposition 188, sponsored by tobacco interests, would 
preempt all local smoking control ordinances in California and replace them 
with a milder statewide standard. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the tea leaves from the 1994 vote returns are fully analyzed and 
scattered by the winds, the 1996 presidential sweepstakes will be under way. 
With a March presidential primary, California may play a more pivotal role in 
the nomination process than it has in decades.

DECISION '94 / SPECIAL GUIDE TO CALIFORNIA'S ELECTIONS; GOVERNOR'S RACE; ABOUT 
THIS RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The governor is California's chief executive officer. He or she lays out each 
year's spending plan in the state budget and determines how to finance it.In 
addition, the governor appoints key officials to head a broad array of 
agencies, departments and commissions. The governor also appoints all Municipal 
and Superior Court judges in California and nominates justices to the state 
Court of Appeal and Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the long campaign, virtually all the attention in the governor's race 
has been focused on the two major party candidates: Democrat Kathleen Brown, 
the current state treasurer, and Republican incumbent Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters will have a choice of five candidates when they go to the polls on Nov. 
8. The other three candidates are Gloria Estela LaRiva of the Peace and Freedom 
Party, Jerome (Jerry) McCready of the American Independent Party and Richard 
Rider of the Libertarian Party.

</P>
<P>
 * Family: Married to television executive Van Gordon Sauter; children Hilary 
Armstrong, Sascha Rice, Zeb Rice; stepsons Mark Sauter, Jeremy Sauter. Three 
grandchildren. Background 
</P>
<P>
 Every other decade, the Brown family dynasty deposits one of its own in the 
corner office that is the seat of power for California's governor. First there 
was Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr., the shopkeeper's son who rose in 1958, by dint 
of hard work, to be the 32nd governor of the vast state. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. who rode into office in 1974 on a wave 
of voter desire for new faces and reform. Now comes Kathleen Brown, daughter of 
Pat and sister of Jerry, propelled by a pragmatic ideology that mixes her 
father's lust for building and her brother's sense that government can supply 
some hammers but not do all the construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngest of the four Brown children -- she came along more than seven 
years after closest sibling Jerry -- she had only the passing knowledge of her 
father's profession that is rested upon all youngsters. She describes her youth 
as somewhat apolitical, but it took a life-altering turn in 1975 when she ran 
for the Los Angeles school board. 
</P>
<P>
 There she found both a lust for political life and the political albatross 
that would continue to hang around her neck for the next 20 years. To her 
supporters, she was someone confident enough to question her own beliefs and on 
occasion change her mind. To her opponents, and there were many in the heated 
days of forced busing, she was a woman without a political compass, changing 
her views from day to day at the whim of internal and external forces. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When she entered the governor's race 19 years later, she was the candidate of 
Democratic dreams -- youthful and vigorous, handsome and well-connected, 
possessing by dint of the dynasty a golden luster that attracted moneyed 
supporters and national media attention. She also seemed to corner the market 
on hopefulness, a sentiment in short supply in California of late. She talked 
endlessly of restoring the California dream, and oddsmakers laid good numbers 
that she would be the state's first woman governor. 
</P>
<P>
 But the path toward Election Day has been anything but smooth. Early on, there 
was the question that haunted her from the school board: Just what does she 
stand for? Brown issued reams of detailed policy positions to quell the 
criticism. She took a hard line on crime, immigration and welfare, as though 
the race was already boiling down to a contest of toughness. The problem, even 
her allies suggested, was that Brown was in danger of becoming in voters' minds 
the "me too" candidate, strategically fighting on Pete Wilson's turf instead of 
staking out her own. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Symbolically, there has been no issue tougher than the death penalty. Brown 
spent months refusing to explain her beliefs, then decided to spell out what 
most had guessed: That her opposition to capital punishment rested on her 
religious views and experience she had gleaned at her father's knee as he 
wrestled with it during his governorship. But, she said, she would enforce it 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the troubles, Brown has cornered the market on miles spent in pursuit 
of her goal. For more than a year, she has circled California, campaigning by 
car, plane and bus, touting her experiences as state treasurer. For several 
months, Brown ran on the moniker of "America's Best Treasurer," a claim she 
based on record bond sales and earnings. According to Brown's campaign, she 
saved taxpayers $350 million by cutting waste and streamlining the bureaucracy. 
And she earned a record $4 billion on the state's investment fund. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also points to other approaches she used in the treasurer's office that 
could apply in the governor's suite: encouraging state investments in 
California firms, buttressing small business and providing tools for families 
to save money for college educations. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the campaign, Brown has insisted that the race was about more than 
the problems of the present, that it was about California's future, both 
economically and culturally. She sought to make it a referendum on the 
unpopular Wilson, gibing incessantly that he was "Rip Van Wilson," a man who 
slumbered as the ship of state hit the rocks and woke up only to ensure his own 
reelection. She released a 62-page economic plan that covered her views on job 
creation, education, immigration, crime and government mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 49, Kathleen Brown is a mother and a grandmother, a woman who 
simultaneously raised her children and went to college, divorced and remarried, 
who went back to school and got her law degree at age 40. She has the boundless 
enthusiasm of one who was raised in a California where anything was possible, 
and her test by Nov. 8 is to convince voters that she has the stuff to lead a 
foundering California back to that gloried place. Promises / Goals 
</P>
<P>
 If elected governor, Kathleen Brown has vowed to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Rebuild the state's economy with a combination of tax credits, tax 
moratoriums and bond issues that would spur growth among emerging businesses, 
help retrain defense workers and put California companies first when it comes 
to government contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Manage the state's multibillion-dollar government, reforming it through 
targeted performance reviews and cutting back on unnecessary government 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Help make California safer, through her support of a "three strikes" law for 
violent offenders and a "one strike" law for rapists and child molesters. 
Although she opposes the death penalty, she says she would carry it out as 
governor. She also supports several measures intended to get wayward youth back 
on track, from anti-drug programs and curfews to a statewide system of boot 
camps for nonviolent offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 * Freeze fees for higher education, which have risen sharply in recent years, 
and provide low-interest student loans. She would also develop a master plan 
for kindergarten through 12th grade, modeled after the higher education master 
plan shepherded by her father in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stop the flood of illegal immigration by increasing penalties for employers 
who hire illegal immigrants, and create a tamper-proof Social Security card 
that every employee must show to gain employment. The Speech: In Her Own Words 
</P>
<P>
 * Excerpts from a speech delivered on Oct. 6 to supporters at Santa Monica 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians up and down this state cannot afford four more years of Pete 
Wilson because Wilson's a career politician. Wilson will stop at nothing, he 
will say anything, he will do anything to get votes. He has done it before and 
he is at it again. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me tell you, he's got a record of catering to the right wing of his 
Republican party and he's got a record of catering to the moneyed and special 
interests while he taxes the middle class and balances his budget on higher 
education and sticks it to you, the students, and we can't afford four more 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me tell you what he is good at. What he is good at is he is the master of 
the 30-second spot. Watch his spots and you'll see the same thing you've seen 
every four years. He plays on your fears, he plays on your anger, he taps into 
the cynicism and draws on the worst of our emotions, instead of reaching out 
and challenging us, instead of reaching out and calling upon the best of 
California and trying to inspire our confidence and our hope for a better 
future. No, not our Pete. He likes to divide, he likes to bully, he likes to 
blame, he likes to bash everybody, from kids to immigrants to the President of 
the United States, and I'm here to say he's got to stop and he's got to stop 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 I say, give Pete Wilson a pension, give him a parade but get him out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 The other thing I ask you to examine, I ask you to examine in all these months 
of campaigning, in all the millions of dollars that Pete Wilson has spent, he 
has not laid out a plan, a vision, a strategy for California -- not one word, 
not one line, not one idea. He wants to ride back into that governor's office 
on his broken promises and his slick 30-second spots. It will not happen. The 
people want better. They want change. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I call him Rip Van Wilson, the ghost governor who wakes up once every four 
years with his election year rhetoric and his election year lies. What 
California needs is a governor from Day 1, a governor with a plan and a vision 
and a strategy to rebuild this state and that is what I offer to you today. You 
see it right here. I've done something maybe unusual in this world of 
telecommunications and 30-second spots. I've taken my plan, I've put it in a 
book. I've put in writing. I've put it on the Internet. And I put it in 
libraries up and down this state and I am calling on voluntary street soldiers 
to take this campaign door-to-door and take this plan door-to-door, to take it 
to the people of California who deserve to have a governor who knows where 
she's going, who wants to take the people with her, who wants to rebuild this 
state. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The people of California are taking this state back by reading this plan and 
seeing what our future can be about. Because this has to become a people's 
campaign, a people's campaign to take our state back from the special 
interests, take it back from the right wing of the Republican party and take it 
back from Peter Barton Wilson. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I was a non-traditional student before it was cool or necessary or imperative 
to be a non-traditional student. It took me 7 1/2 years to get my college 
degree. I didn't get a law degree until I was 40 years old. I raised a family, 
I worked, I went to school like so many of you are doing and I know how hard it 
is. But I have to tell you what I also know: I know that without this college 
education, you won't have the chance to be the fully realized citizen and 
taxpayer that I want you to be. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So I'm here to say you are our future. We have got to invest in you and you 
have got to invest back in our state and in our communities, so read my plan. 
It's my blueprint for our future, it's my blueprint for your future. Read it, 
check it out, give me your ideas. You're not going to agree with everything in 
it, that's OK. If you did, you should be running for governor, not me. But the 
idea is you need to have a governor who's got a plan that will take us 
somewhere from this place that we have been locked in, of fear and bullying and 
bashing and blaming. 
</P>
<P>
 Get involved. Use your voice, use your voice and use your vote. If you don't 
use it, you are going to lose it. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Make a choice, because it is your future that is at stake and you have got a 
choice in this election. You have got a choice between politician Pete, who's 
got a plan for his own reelection, and Kathleen Brown, who's got a plan to 
rebuild California for you.

DECISION '94 / SPECIAL GUIDE TO CALIFORNIA'S ELECTIONS; GOVERNOR'S RACE; THE 
ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A look at the key issues in the race for the governor: Immigration 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigration was seized on early by Wilson as a central issue of his 
reelection, and it has been a key battleground of the gubernatorial campaign. 
The incumbent governor supports Proposition 187, which would cut off 
non-emergency health care and public education from illegal immigrants, and 
would require medical and educational personnel to report those suspected of 
being in the country illegally. Brown opposes the proposition, arguing that it 
would throw hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren into the streets, spread 
disease and turn public officials into snitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's positions are based on his theory that illegal immigrants are drawn 
to California by free public services. He favors an amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution that would deny automatic citizenship to the children of illegal 
immigrants who are born in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown believes that illegal immigrants are drawn to the state because of jobs. 
She would strengthen penalties against employers who knowingly hire illegal 
immigrants and favors the creation of a tamper-proof Social Security card that 
all employees would have to present while seeking work. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has waged a much-publicized effort to shame President Clinton into 
paying for illegal immigrants, writing full-page advertisements in major 
newspapers and running ads asking people to call the White House to complain 
about immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has worked with the Clinton Administration to increase federal funding 
for combatting illegal immigration, and has accused Wilson of hypocrisy for his 
current handling of the issue. She argues that while he was in the U.S. Senate 
from 1982-90, Wilson was an advocate for the agriculture industry's desire to 
increase the number of farm workers allowed over the border. Crime 
</P>
<P>
 With crime at the top of the list of voter concerns, both candidates have 
portrayed themselves as tough on criminals. Both have backed stricter 
sentencing laws, tougher sanctions for parole violators and increased crime 
prevention efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson this year signed into law a bevy of tougher sentencing provisions, all 
of which Brown supports. Wilson wants even tougher laws and proposes to expand 
the death penalty to cover carjackers and drive-by shooters who kill their 
victims. Brown opposes that idea but says she would put it on the ballot and 
let the voters decide. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than focus on the death penalty, which Brown says is more important to 
political campaigning than to criminal justice policy, the Democrat says she 
would try to prevent youths from committing their first crime and promises 
swift and certain punishment to those who do. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has criticized Wilson for his handling of the parole system and said she 
would order all ex-convicts who violate the conditions of their parole returned 
to prison pending a hearing to decide their fate.  
</P>
<P>
 Wilson says the parole issue would be moot if convicts were kept in prison 
longer in the first place. Both candidates supported the new "three strikes" 
sentencing law, though Brown has said she preferred a version that focused on 
violent criminals. Death Penalty 
</P>
<P>
 Capital punishment has been the focus of much attention in the governor's 
race, with Wilson clamoring that Brown will not enforce the death penalty -- at 
least not as avidly as he -- and Brown insisting she will. 
</P>
<P>
 The two candidates differ in their personal views about capital punishment. 
Wilson supports it personally, and argues that only a person who believes as he 
does can be counted on to enforce it. Both candidates insist that they will 
appoint judges who will enforce the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown sought to avoid explaining her views for months, then in June said she 
personally opposed it for religious reasons and because she recalled that her 
father, former Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr., agonized over the issue when he 
was in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who has signed execution orders for two men during his governorship, 
spent much of the campaign raising the specter that Brown would handle capital 
punishment like her brother, Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. He named Rose 
Elizabeth Bird as chief justice of the California Supreme Court, a post from 
which Bird cast aside almost 60 death sentences. State Finances 
</P>
<P>
 On fiscal issues Brown has little record, while Wilson has renounced some of 
the key actions he took as governor. Wilson, in his first year, agreed to raise 
taxes by more than $7 billion, but now, as a candidate, he says higher taxes 
are a drag on the state's economy. Brown criticizes Wilson for raising taxes 
but applauded him when he did it and says now she has no plans to undo his 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking a political beating for the tax increase, Wilson tried to tread 
water fiscally by shifting billions from city and county governments to the 
schools, an action that relieved the state of part of its obligation. When that 
tactic failed to balance the budget, Wilson resorted to borrowing, first in the 
guise of "loans" to the schools and then, in his third and fourth years in 
office, by openly accepting year-to-year deficit financing. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson justified the deficit by pointing out that his budgets included a plan 
to repay the borrowing. But this year Wilson abandoned even that argument, 
resting his hopes on the unlikely prospect of the federal government coming 
forth with $2.8 billion to reimburse the state for the cost of serving and 
jailing illegal immigrants. If that money does not arrive, the state will be 
hard-pressed to repay the billions it has borrowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown advocates wrapping the state's debt into a single bond and paying it off 
over five years. The debt payments would be made with money from a surcharge on 
income taxes paid by the wealthy that was adopted in 1991 and is due to expire 
at the end of 1995.  
</P>
<P>
 On other aspects of the budget, both would cut welfare, although Wilson, who 
already has reduced grants by 15%, would cut more deeply. Both would continue 
to fund a massive prison expansion. Both say they would like to give more to 
education, but neither has shown how that could be done. Brown has said she 
would freeze college fees for at least one year. Jobs / Economy 
</P>
<P>
 The economy has been one of the key issues throughout the 1994 election 
campaign. Brown claims that her economic plan, contained in a 62-page booklet 
entitled "Building a New California," will lead to the creation of 1 million 
new private sector jobs during her first four years in office.  
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Wilson insists that economic recovery already is well under way. 
Wilson maintains that his Administration has stopped the outflow of companies 
from California to other states that claim a more attractive business climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in his Administration, Wilson bad-mouthed the California economy and 
made many business leaders irate by saying the Golden State was a bad place to 
do business. In 1993, however, after Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco) sponsored an economic summit conference in Los Angeles, Wilson 
worked with leaders in the Legislature to develop a program that would entice 
California businesses to keep operating here and to attract companies from 
other states. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan included some business sales tax reductions, a first step toward 
reform of workers' compensation insurance and some streamlining of business 
regulations. The governor says he will continue to push for legislation to make 
California an even better place to do business if he is reelected.  
</P>
<P>
 Brown argues that Wilson has not done nearly enough. Brown has proposed a plan 
that includes a state tax moratorium on new, start-up businesses; a tax credit 
of up to $10,000 for every new job created, what she calls "real regulatory 
relief" and the expediting of the permitting process for new firms or expansion 
of existing businesses. Education 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a former Los Angeles school board member, and Wilson, who campaigned in 
1990 on the promise that he would be California's "education governor," each 
claim education as their issue and accuse the other of failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown notes that during Wilson's tenure, fees have increased by large amounts 
at state universities and community colleges. She also criticizes him for 
allowing California's K-12 classrooms to remain the most overcrowded in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has portrayed Brown as an inexperienced manager whose proposals would 
not accomplish what they promise. For example, Wilson says that a $300-million 
bond package that Brown proposes to pay for computers in schools and increased 
school safety would not have any impact on California classrooms until 1996 at 
the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown proposes creating a "JobReady" program in every high school to better 
prepare students to enter the work force. To make schools safer, Brown proposes 
that children who are caught carrying guns to school should be sent to special 
disciplinary academies -- or boot camp schools -- for up to a year.  
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has called for "zero tolerance" for weapons, violence and drugs at 
schools and the immediate expulsion of students who do not comply. He has 
signed a law allowing juveniles 14 or older who are charged with shootings or 
other serious violent crimes to be tried as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding higher education, Brown has pledged to freeze fees at state 
universities and community colleges for one year, and to fight future tuition 
hikes. She wants to create a state student loan program, leveraging existing 
non-general fund dollars to provide up to $200 million in low-interest loans 
for middle-class families.  
</P>
<P>
 Wilson maintains that fee hikes were necessitated by the state's fiscal 
crisis, and that despite them, California's public colleges and universities 
are still a bargain. And he notes that since he took office, financial aid 
loans to California students have more than doubled. Environment 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to the 1990 election for governor, the environment has been a hidden 
issue in the 1994 campaign. Democrat Brown won the endorsement of both major 
groups that take sides in electoral politics: the Sierra Club and the League of 
Conservation Voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, Wilson supported environmental issues such as creation of a 
state Cabinet environmental agency and instituting some form of growth 
management in California. Wilson pledged that he would be active as 
California's "environmental czar." But with the recession and the decline of 
environmental issues as high on the lists of priorities of voters, Wilson has 
been largely quiet on these issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates have pledged to work to streamline environmental regulations 
in the siting or expansion of new businesses as a means of boosting jobs in 
California. The League of Conservation Voters said Wilson has been particularly 
disappointing on the issues of water and growth management. Wilson appointed a 
Growth Management Council of his Administration officials, but its report was 
delayed a year and fell short of expectations on the part of growth management 
advocates. Wilson declined to sponsor legislation to implement any of its 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson moved toward protection of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and 
assurance of quality water supplies to urban California, but broke off the 
consensus process in what the League called "an abdication of a state role." 
Brown pledges to break the Delta stalemate. Abortion 
</P>
<P>
 Both Wilson and Brown support a woman's right to choose to have an abortion. 
Brown opposes all abortion restrictions such as parental notification policies 
and funding prohibitions. Wilson supports parental notification except in cases 
where a judge rules that no notification is necessary. In 1991, after the 
federal government took action to deny federal funds for clinics that provided 
information about abortion, Wilson committed $7 million in state funds to 
compensate for the loss. Both candidates have been endorsed by the California 
Abortion Rights Action League. Gay Rights 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has sent mixed signals on gay rights, vetoing two major bills supported 
by groups representing gays and signing one. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor, in his first year, vetoed legislation that would have prohibited 
employers from discriminating against gays based on their sexual orientation. 
Wilson's veto prompted an outpouring of protest because Wilson had indicated he 
would sign the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, Wilson signed a similar bill that gave gays the right to file 
grievances with the state labor commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Wilson vetoed a measure that would have allowed couples of any 
sexual orientation to register with the state as domestic partners. Brown said 
she would have signed the bill.

DECISION '94 / SPECIAL GUIDE TO CALIFORNIA'S ELECTIONS; GOVERNOR'S RACE; THE 
REPUBLICAN: PETE WILSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>

of California, Boalt Hall, 1962. 
</P>
<P>

U.S. senator, 1983-91; governor since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 * Family: Married in 1983 to Gayle Wilson; stepsons Todd and Philip Graham. 
Background 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Wilson is the incumbent running under the banner of change. 
</P>
<P>
 Elected to public office nine times, the former legislator, San Diego mayor 
and U.S. senator says he wants to complete a job undone. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected to a second term, Wilson says, he will try to cut deeper into 
welfare benefits, enact more laws to stiffen prison sentences for violent 
criminals and make it easier for companies to do business in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican chief executive also says he will try to do in a second term 
what he vowed to do in his first: shift the emphasis of state government from 
remediation -- cleaning up messes -- to preventing problems before they happen. 
</P>
<P>
 That goal, which Wilson outlined during his 1990 campaign and in his first 
speeches as governor, was stymied by an economic recession that depressed tax 
revenues and left him in a four-year struggle to balance the state budget, 
which he never did. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Born in 1933 in Lake Forest, Ill., near Chicago, Wilson moved with his family 
to St. Louis, where his father sold advertising. There, the young Wilson 
attended private schools, dabbling in boxing and football despite his slight 
stature. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson attended Yale on a Marine Corps ROTC scholarship and, upon graduating 
with a degree in English literature, went on active duty just after the end of 
the Korean War. He spent most of his tour in Hawaii as a lieutenant, the 
executive officer of a rifle company. Wilson entered law school at the 
University of California's Boalt Hall in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduation, Wilson moved to San Diego and joined the law firm of the 
father of his former classmate, John Davies. Practicing law for only a short 
time, he quickly moved into Republican politics and in 1966 was elected to 
represent San Diego in the state Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days Wilson was a moderate, pushing for a "no-bust" policy for 
marijuana users and fashioning a comprehensive law to protect the coastline 
from development, a proposal that failed passage but helped lay the groundwork 
for what became the California Coastal Commission. In 1971, at age 37, Wilson 
ran for mayor of San Diego and was elected on a platform to clean up a corrupt 
municipal government and restrain development in the city's burgeoning suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As mayor, Wilson followed through by pushing for campaign reform -- limiting 
political contributions to $250 -- and he fashioned a growth management plan 
for the city that was considered a model for the nation. Wilson tried to expand 
the powers of his office but was rejected by the voters, so he worked within 
the existing structure to accomplish his ends, helping to elect allies to the 
council and engineering the selection of a city manager who would work closely 
with the mayor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1978, when he first ran for governor, Wilson was unquestionably in charge 
of the city, but he still was little-known statewide, and he took a drubbing in 
the Republican primary. As he returned to San Diego and set his sights on the 
next statewide races, Wilson grew closer to the development industry with which 
he had once been at odds. 
</P>
<P>
 In one defining moment, Wilson sided with the builders and against 
neighborhood groups when the city approved a 40,000-home development on San 
Diego's northern edge. Opponents said the project was just the sort of suburban 
sprawl Wilson had pledged to fight, but the mayor said it was a well-planned 
community that would pay its own way and provide services to its residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, Wilson again geared up to run for governor, but Republican financial 
backers persuaded him to run for the Senate instead. He won, defeating Gov. 
Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. while championing a ballot initiative known as the 
"victims bill of rights." It was Wilson's first serious foray into the politics 
of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a senator, Wilson focused on defense policy and agriculture, two issues 
near and dear to his state's constituents. He tried to keep weapons contracts 
flowing to California's defense industry and worked to open international 
markets for the state's farmers. He also represented agriculture's interests in 
the immigration reform debate, pushing for provisions that would make it easier 
for farms to hire foreign migrant workers to pick crops. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, now 61, ran for governor in 1990, defeating Democrat Dianne Feinstein. 
He pledged to clean up the state's fiscal mess and work to improve education, 
protect the environment and fight crime. But the budget problems turned out to 
be far worse than he feared, all but overwhelming his first term. 
</P>
<P>
 We are turning California's jobs climate from a job killer into a job creator. 
And yes, we are proud that after the earthquake we rebuilt the world's busiest 
freeways in record time. And we think that the people need, that they deserve, 
three strikes -- one strike, our law to try dangerous juveniles as adults; we 
are proud that we have passed the toughest package of crime legislation in the 
history of California. 
</P>
<P>
 And we will not rest in our efforts to force Washington to face up to the 
crisis of illegal immigration. In short, we are making the change that is 
needed to make California all that it can be. We're turning this state around. 
We are restoring the hope and the confidence of Californians. Promises / Goals 
</P>
<P>
 If elected governor, Pete Wilson has vowed to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Not raise taxes again. Wilson in 1991 signed a record $7.5-billion tax 
increase but now says higher taxes are a drag on the state's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cut welfare. Wilson has reduced welfare grants by 15% since he became 
governor; he says he wants to cut them more. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reduce regulation of business to entice more companies to expand here or 
open new plants in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 * Expand the death penalty to cover drive-by shooters and carjackers who kill 
their victims. Amend sentencing laws to ensure that all violent felons serve 
the entire term to which they are sentenced. The Speech: In His Own Words 
</P>
<P>
 * Excerpts from a speech delivered to state GOP convention in San Diego on 
Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The voters are looking to the Republican Party this fall because they know we 
are the party of change. The party that is addressing the real issues that 
legitimately stir people's emotions because they, in fact, basically affect the 
quality of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, when I said to Gayle I think we should go home, I said we 
should go home, leave this pleasant academic cloister, the U.S. Senate, come 
home to make change, change that California needs to be all that it can be. 
Well, I am proud of what we have done and I'm running for a second term as 
governor to continue fighting for the further change that we need to further 
improve our jobs climate and create prosperity, to overhaul our welfare system 
and free people from dependency, to improve the quality of our schools and 
reclaim our streets from violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 And like all of you who are working to bring about that fundamental change, I 
am guided by fundamental principles and core values. It's time to give back the 
people who work hard, pay their taxes and raise their children to obey the law 
a decent opportunity. They deserve a break. It's time for us to teach our kids 
as well that their actions have consequences and that society must and will 
hold individuals accountable for their actions. I want California to be a state 
of unparalleled opportunity. I want our kids to learn more and earn more than 
we have. 
</P>
<P>
 But opportunity must begin with responsibility. And the greatest 
responsibility is that of parent to child. It's time that parents started 
accepting that responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 And too many today don't or can't accept it, and by failing to provide love 
and discipline and direction that every child needs, they consign their 
children to material and spiritual poverty. So we've got to get some things 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
 Young men have no right to casually father a child and then walk away, no 
strings attached. So we are cracking down on deadbeat dads and sending them a 
very clear message: If you lack the basic decency to send love to your child, 
you've better damn well send money or we will track you down and dock your pay 
for child support. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-aged girls need to understand that they have no right to have a child out 
of wedlock, to raise a child without a wed father and then expect the taxpayers 
to support their child. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-aged thugs need to know that they will no longer have the right in 
California to commit a crime and then expect to be coddled by the Youth 
Authority simply because they are juveniles. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 And no able-bodied adult has a right to refuse honest work and expect the 
taxpayers to continue supporting him on welfare. Welfare should be a safety 
net, not a hammock. So we propose to set time limits and make work pay more 
than welfare. But, you know, just as individuals have responsibilities, so too 
do governments. They often intrude where they shouldn't, but they also have 
some clear basic responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the federal government's first responsibilities is defending our 
nation's borders. . . . Well, today, the federal government clearly flunks that 
test. Washington has lost control of our borders, but it is California that is 
paying the price. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me say something that I think is important: You know, it is impossible not 
to sympathize with those who struggle to bring their families to a better way 
of life. It's impossible not to admire their guts and their gumption. I only 
wish that Washington had one-tenth the guts of illegal immigrants. But they do 
not, so they continue turning a blind eye . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We must end the federal mandate for services which steal from our taxpayers, 
from our schoolchildren, from our needy elderly, blind and disabled, all of 
whom have suffered erosion because of what we have to pay for these services 
mandated by Washington. And to end the services we've got to send Washington a 
message so clear that it cannot be ignored, and this November we have a chance 
to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, the "Save Our State" initiative, is the two-by-four we need 
to make them take notice in Washington. It is what we need to provoke a legal 
challenge that will go all the way to the United States Supreme Court, a legal 
challenge to the federal mandates that keep in place the incentives to illegal 
entry. It will finally force Washington to accept its responsibility for 
illegal immigration. That's why I support SOS and urge all of you to work for 
its passage on Election Day. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I think the voters want and deserve a governor who will fight crime 
effectively, not someone who fudges on the death penalty. And of course, 
Kathleen has an excuse for everything. She explains away her opposition to the 
death penalty by saying that even though she personally opposes the death 
penalty as a matter of deep personal conscience, of moral convictions, she'll 
enforce the law. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 We are turning California's jobs climate from a job killer into a job creator. 
And yes, we are proud that after the earthquake we rebuilt the world's busiest 
freeways in record time. And we think that the people need, that they desreve, 
three strikes, one strike, our law to try dangerous juveniles as adults; we are 
proud that we have passed the toughest package of crime legislation in the 
history of California. 
</P>
<P>
 And we will not rest in our efforts to force Washington to face up to the 
crisis of illegal immigration. In short, we are making the change that is 
needed to make California all that it can be. We're turning this state around. 
We are restoring the hope and the confidence of Californians.

DECISION '94 / SPECIAL GUIDE TO CALIFORNIA'S ELECTIONS; U.S. SENATE; ABOUT THIS 
RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The outcome of the Nov. 8 election for one of California's seats in the U.S. 
Senate could decide whether Democrats or Republicans control that legislative 
body next year. Republican Pete Wilson won this seat in 1988, serving until he 
was elected governor in 1990.His appointee, John Seymour, was defeated two 
years later when voters chose Democrat Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein now seeks reelection to a full six-year term. She began the election 
year with a strong lead in the polls. But Rep. Mike Huffington (R-Santa 
Barbara) caught up in what has become the most expensive Senate race in U.S. 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Senate is one of the federal government's two legislative chambers 
and consists of two members from each of the 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
 The other candidates on the November ballot are Paul Meeuwenberg, a Los 
Angeles marketing consultant, American Independent Party; Richard Benjamin 
Boddie, a Huntington Beach member of the Libertarian Party; Elizabeth Cervantes 
Barron, a San Jose teacher, Peace and Freedom Party; and Barbara Blong, a San 
Francisco educator, Green Party.

DECISION '94 / SPECIAL GUIDE TO CALIFORNIA'S ELECTIONS; U.S. SENATE; THE ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A look at the key issues in the race for the U.S. Senate: Economy 
</P>
<P>
 One of the major issues of contention between the Senate candidates is the 
1993 Clinton economic package that was narrowly passed over Huffington's 
objection and with Feinstein's support. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein believes the package of spending cuts and tax increases is 
responsible for a reduction in the federal budget deficit and, she said, it is 
a major factor in recent improvements in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has described the vote as a tax hike and a typical Democratic 
solution to budget problems. The GOP candidate voted against Clinton's economic 
package as well as the Republican alternative, which he said did not cut enough 
from government spending. He has also called for a repeal of all tax increases 
in the Clinton package. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton package included an increase in the gasoline tax and a higher 
income tax for upper-income payers. Defending her vote, Feinstein's office has 
calculated that only 163,000 California taxpayers received an income tax 
increase -- representing the state's wealthiest 1.5% -- while more than 12 
million people saw no increase or a reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates have supported a number of incentives for businesses, 
including a reduction in the capital gains tax and tax credits for research. 
Feinstein authored provisions for both, as well as funding for urban enterprise 
zones, in a bill that was passed last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has voted against most of the major appropriations bills to come 
before Congress, underscoring his point that government spending should be 
reduced. He has rarely been specific, however, about his objections or offered 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said he supports a reduction in federal regulations as a means to 
improve the economy. He supported a plan to require that future federal 
regulations include an economic impact report assessing their effect on private 
property values. Another measure would allow businesses adversely affected by 
federal regulations to apply for a waiver. Another sought to improve available 
credit by reducing the regulatory burden on financial institutions that are 
considered safe. 
</P>
<P>
 On trade, Feinstein opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement, but she 
is a supporter of the upcoming General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. 
Huffington supported NAFTA, but he is undecided about GATT. Health Care 
</P>
<P>
 Neither candidate has embraced a specific health care plan. Feinstein was 
originally a co-sponsor of the Clinton plan, but she withdrew her name in May. 
Since then, she has worked with moderate lawmakers in Washington to craft a 
plan that has a more limited government role in the health care system. 
Huffington opposed the Clinton plan and the subsequent compromises that have 
been offered. He also ruled out any employer mandates or tax increases. Welfare 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement outlining "the central theme of my campaign," Huffington 
unveiled a plan during the summer to end government welfare and replace it with 
charitable giving. Huffington said the welfare state is a root cause of many 
growing social problems such as crime, homelessness, poverty and declining 
moral values. He endorsed three steps to reduce government's welfare role -- a 
bill to expand tax breaks for charitable giving; a proposal to prohibit cash 
grants to parents who have children while they are on welfare, and a plan to 
provide federal welfare money to states in block grants, allowing for more 
experimentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington was not specific about how government would transfer its duties to 
private and community groups except to say that he believes the nation is 
becoming more spiritually aware and generous. Critics of Huffington's plan, 
including Feinstein, said they do not believe charitable groups have the 
capacity to assume the responsibilities now handled by government. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein also has been critical of the welfare system. She has supported 
Clinton's plan to stop welfare benefits after two years for those who have not 
found work. Environment 
</P>
<P>
 One of Feinstein's major landmarks in the Senate was passage of the California 
Desert Protection Act, dubbed by supporters as the most significant 
environmental legislation in more than a decade. The bill was introduced by 
former Sen. Alan Cranston and stalled in Congress until Feinstein made it a 
priority of her first term. The legislation elevates Death Valley and Joshua 
Tree national monuments to national parks -- affording greater protection -- 
and adds 4 million acres of wilderness to their territories as well as a new 
national preserve in the east Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington opposed the desert bill, saying it is a federal land grab that 
government cannot afford. He also said it will cost jobs by adversely affecting 
some of the state's interests including ranchers, miners and recreation 
advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On other issues, both candidates have told farmers they support modifications 
to the Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein and Huffington have said they would require an economic impact 
report about the costs related to protection of any species on the endangered 
list. They also agree that there are some cases -- notably the kangaroo rat -- 
in which the economic cost of saving a species is too great. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Green, the 1990 environmental initiative, has also been an issue in the 
Senate race. Huffington, who was living in Texas at the time but said he 
nonetheless opposed the idea, has criticized Feinstein's support for the 
measure. But Democratic officials contend that Huffington was being 
hypocritical because, at the time, he served on the board of directors of the 
Natural Resources Defense Council, a major proponent of Big Green. Huffington 
said he does not remember discussing the issue while he served at the 
organization. Social Issues 
</P>
<P>
 Both Huffington and Feinstein support abortion rights, although the issue has 
still proven contentious. The California Abortion Rights Action League has 
criticized Huffington for voting against federal funding of abortions for 
indigent women. He has said he supports the Freedom of Choice Act, but he was 
criticized by the California group for not being a co-sponsor of the measure. 
Huffington also said he supported a bill restricting protesters at abortion 
clinics, but he was criticized for opposing amendments to the plan that the 
abortion rights group considered crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 On the issue of federal judicial confirmations, Feinstein said support for 
abortion rights would be a prerequisite for her vote. Huffington said he would 
not make such a requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 The two candidates supported Clinton's plan to allow gays in the military. And 
they backed his Family Leave Act, providing time off for employees with family 
emergencies. Immigration 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration is another issue where Feinstein and Huffington have battled 
frequently in speeches and on television. 
</P>
<P>
 On Proposition 187, the November ballot initiative to cut off benefits to 
illegal immigrants, the candidates have split. Feinstein opposes the measure on 
grounds that it is unconstitutional and will be extremely costly to the state. 
Huffington supports the initiative because he believes granting benefits is 
tantamount to a reward for lawbreakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates have called for a significant increase in the border guard 
deployment in California, for more federal money to reimburse the state for 
immigration costs and for tamper-proof identification cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein has introduced legislation that covers a comprehensive list of 
immigration reforms including more equipment and staff for border enforcement, 
fewer benefits to immigrants, tamper-proof identification cards and increased 
penalties for violations. Funding for the improvements would come from a $1 
border-crossing fee, which Huffington opposes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, meanwhile, has voted for a bill that would add 6,000 new guards to 
the border over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington supported the North American Free Trade Agreement, in part, because 
he said it would reduce illegal immigration by improving the economy in Mexico. 
Feinstein opposed NAFTA. Unlike Feinstein, Huffington also supports a 
constitutional amendment that would prevent babies born in America to illegal 
immigrant parents from automatically becoming U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 In their campaign, both candidates have criticized the other's record on 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein charged in a television commercial that her opponent opposed more 
guards at the border because he voted against an appropriations bill that 
included funding for them. Huffington said, however, that he voted to increase 
the guard, but opposed the appropriations bill because it included unnecessary 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has criticized Feinstein's support while she was mayor of San 
Francisco for a resolution calling on local officials not to enforce federal 
immigration laws on refugees fleeing a bloody period in El Salvador. Crime 
</P>
<P>
 Crime has been a major issue of confrontation between Feinstein and 
Huffington, but on many of the major votes or proposals, they have similar 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates support the death penalty, an assault weapons ban, the Brady 
bill waiting period for handgun purchases, the federal crime bill and the 
"three-strikes" initiative on the November ballot. Their conflicts have largely 
focused on the subjective question of who is the tougher crime fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein has claimed to be the champion on the issue, in part because she 
authored the provision in the federal crime bill that bans the sale or 
manufacture of 19 different styles of assault weapons. Huffington supported the 
crime bill and the assault weapons ban. But he has been criticized by Feinstein 
and others for joining other Republicans in a procedural vote that threatened 
to kill the crime bill. Huffington said his vote against a procedural rule on 
the crime bill succeeded in stripping the $30-billion measure of inappropriate 
social spending programs. But Huffington's action angered many police groups 
that had been lobbying for the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference between the candidates on the crime bill was a major reason 
more than a dozen of California's biggest law enforcement organizations -- 
including Los Angeles County's Republican Sheriff Sherman Block -- have 
endorsed Feinstein's reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, in turn, has noted that he is a co-sponsor of the "three-strikes" 
initiative, not just a supporter like Feinstein. In television commercials, he 
has also called Feinstein a flip-flopper on the death penalty. Feinstein 
acknowledges that she opposed the death penalty during the 1960s before she 
became an elected official. She has supported capital punishment for more than 
20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Huffington has tried to question Feinstein's commitment to the death 
penalty. In one of his television commercials, he criticized her vote in the 
Senate for Florida Judge Rosemary Barkett, saying the jurist has opposed the 
death penalty in more than 100 cases including a grisly teen-age murder. But 
even legal analysts speaking for Huffington's campaign acknowledged that 
Barkett has supported more death penalty convictions than she has opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 In voting to confirm judges to the federal bench, both candidates said they 
would oppose any candidate who did not support the death penalty.

DECISION '94 / SPECIAL GUIDE TO CALIFORNIA'S ELECTIONS; U.S. SENATE; THE 
REPUBLICAN: MIKE HUFFINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MIKE HUFFINGTON, Republican 
</P>
<P>
 * Born: Sept. 3, 1947, Dallas 
</P>
<P>
 * Residence: Santa Barbara  
</P>
<P>
 * Current position: U.S. congressman 
</P>
<P>
 * Education: Bachelor's degrees in engineering and economics from Stanford 
University, master's degree in finance from Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
 * Career highlights: Deputy assistant secretary of defense for negotiations 
policy in the Reagan Administration, 1986; vice chairman of Roy M. Huffington 
Inc., a Houston oil and gas company owned by his family, 1976-1990; co-founder 
of Simmons & Huffington, a Houston investment firm, 1974-1976. 
</P>
<P>
 * Family: Wife, Arianna, and two daughters. Background 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Huffington was born in Dallas 47 years ago, son and namesake of Roy M. 
Huffington Sr., the legendary Texas wildcatter who struck it rich in oil and 
natural gas and later became one of the national Republican Party's major 
contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 When Huffington was born, his father was a geologist for Humble Oil. When Mike 
Huffington was 9, his father set out on his own to start an oil and gas 
prospecting company. Huffington and his younger sister grew up mostly in 
Bellaire, Tex., a middle-class Houston suburb of ranch-style homes, diner-style 
cafes and Art Deco movie theaters. Huffington was a teen-ager when his father's 
work started to pay off and, at 14, he was sent to the Culver Military Academy 
in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington rowed on the crew and excelled as a student military officer. After 
Culver, he attended his father's alma mater, Southern Methodist University in 
Dallas, and in 1966 he attended Stanford, where he pursued degrees in 
engineering and economics. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington showed his first interest in politics at Stanford, volunteering for 
Ronald Reagan's 1968 presidential campaign. That summer he also worked in the 
Washington office of Houston Rep. George Bush, a friend of Huffington's father. 
Later, he earned a master's degree in finance from Harvard Business School. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's first step into a professional career was at the First National 
Bank of Chicago, where he spent two years in the finance office with a friend 
from Harvard. In 1974, with his friend's connections, Huffington joined a 
start-up investment company that offered financial advice to companies working 
in the Houston oil fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington left that company two years later, pocketing about $700,000 after a 
lawsuit against his two former partners. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next 14 years, Huffington helped direct the business his father had 
started -- Roy M. Huffington Inc., or Huffco. The company had struck it rich 
while Mike Huffington was in graduate school by hitting a huge natural gas 
reserve in Indonesia. It took years, however, for the company to prepare the 
financing and infrastructure to move the gas from an Indonesia jungle to its 
Japanese buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, Huffington married the Greek-born Arianna Stassinopoulos, a noted 
author and New York socialite. A short time later, Huffington began a one-year 
stint in Washington, where President Reagan appointed him to be deputy 
assistant secretary of defense. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1987, the couple had bought a $4.3-million mansion in the hills of 
Montecito near Santa Barbara. Arianna Huffington moved into the home with her 
mother and sister while Mike Huffington remained in Houston working at the 
family business. By the time Huffington moved to California in 1991, the couple 
had two daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffco was sold in 1990 to Taiwan's Chinese Petroleum Co. for about $600 
million, making Huffington's father one of America's richest men and earning 
the son an estimated $75-million fortune. Huffington said he remained in 
Houston for a year after the sale because of ongoing litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 California political watchers first heard of Huffington when he was about to 
unseat an 18-year Republican incumbent, Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura). 
What made the feat remarkable was that Huffington, virtually unknown in the 
area, spent more than $5.2 million of his own money on the race -- about double 
the previous record for the most ever spent on a House seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his election to the House two years ago, Huffington said, he has 
intentionally avoided the role of legislative activist. For one thing, he says, 
Republicans have little chance of success because Democrats control the 
Congress. For another, Huffington said he went to Washington to scale back the 
size of government, not to add more laws. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, his tenure has been marked mostly by votes against prominent 
appropriations bills and other legislation. But he also demonstrated his 
independence from the Republican leadership by supporting the Family Leave Act 
and the policy allowing gays to serve in the military. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington raised Republican eyebrows again when he announced he would run for 
the U.S. Senate barely nine months after he assumed his House office. The power 
of his wealth cleared the field of any major Republican challengers, leaving 
only former Orange County Rep. William E. Dannemeyer, who was easily defeated 
in the GOP primary. Promises / Goals 
</P>
<P>
 If elected senator, Mike Huffington has vowed to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Improve the economy by cutting the taxes that were raised in the 1993 
economic package, reducing regulations that apply to businesses, requiring the 
government to consider the economic impact of new federal regulations and 
reducing oversight of safe financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make the streets safer with tougher sentencing laws including the "three 
strikes" language in federal cases. To restrict dangerous weapons, he supports 
the ban on military-style assault weapons and the waiting period for handgun 
purchases. He would only vote for judges who support the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stop the flow of illegal immigration over the border by requiring 
tamper-proof identification cards, beefing up the Border Patrol and cutting 
education and health benefits to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 * Decrease the impact of environmental regulations on business by changing the 
Endangered Species Act. The Speech: In His Own Words 
</P>
<P>
 * Excerpts from a speech delivered at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco 
on Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a seismic shift taking place in the country today. Voters are angry 
and justifiably so. Politicians treated voter anger as a fad in 1992, thinking 
this too shall pass -- after one election cycle. They were wrong. . . . When 
they voted for Clinton, they voted for change and they didn't get it. They feel 
betrayed. And justifiably so. 
</P>
<P>
 They won't be fooled a second time. This will be a watershed year, the year we 
begin to make the transition from the professional politician to the 
citizen-politician. When you run to challenge the system, as I have done, you 
challenge -- not just the political status quo, you challenge the fundamental 
ideas upon which the whole system rests. For a lot of people who are very 
interested in the system, that's very threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 People who want fundamental change have responded to my message of taking the 
power out of Washington and putting it back in the hands of ordinary people. 
But there are others who prefer what my opponent has promised: the security of 
the status quo. In fact, Sen. Feinstein's colleague, Congressman Bob Matsui, 
has said it best: "Dianne is someone the Washington Establishment has taken to 
right away. She's not a boat-rocker." Well, I am a boat-rocker, I am a 
risk-taker. I am a businessman who wants to get government out of the way so we 
can unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of the American people. My agenda is 
about more than just different policy proposals. It is about a different way of 
thinking about how democracy should work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is why, I believe, there are those who find my candidacy threatening. . . 
. It's not just that they're afraid of my defeating an entrenched California 
Democrat; it's not just that they're afraid of the impending GOP majority in 
the Senate. It's not just that they fear that my victory will be seen as a 
referendum on the Clinton-Feinstein-Boxer regime. 
</P>
<P>
 What they fear is that by asking people to question the bankrupt ideology upon 
which Washington is built, I have exposed this bankruptcy for all to see. And 
they are afraid that it is only a matter of time -- a very short time -- before 
we send the whole rusted, cynical Establishment tumbling down. By questioning 
the myths of the dominant liberal culture upon which politics as usual is 
founded, I have drawn a line in the sand of time, and they are afraid of being 
found out, stranded standing on the wrong side of history. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, what specifically is it about my ideas that inspires fear into the 
hearts of the guardians of the East Coast liberal Establishment? First, I have 
blown the whistle on the oldest game in town. It's the 
I'll-scratch-your-back-if-you'll-scratch-mine, pork-trading game played by 
lifetime insiders that is designed to keep politicians in Washington forever 
and voters in the dark. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I've broken the first rule in politics: If you want to make friends with the 
emperor, don't tell him he's not wearing any clothes. Well, I don't want to go 
to the Senate to make friends with the Establishment. . . . You would think, to 
judge from the reaction to my candidacy from Mrs. Feinstein and her fellow 
travelers, that I had uttered not political proposals, but religious heresy. 
And I guess, in a way, perhaps I have. Their creed is political salvationism. 
Big government is their god. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's the second reason they are enraged by my candidacy. The myth 
perpetuated by believers in big government is the government is the source of 
all blessings to man -- it provides solutions, it provides programs, it even 
provides, if Hillary Clinton is to be believed, a sense of meaning and 
security. This, of course, is liberal nonsense. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A prime example of how I'd like to achieve (change) is through my proposal for 
dismantling the federal welfare state. . . . I don't care how often Bill 
Clinton and Dianne Feinstein promise to "reform" it by priming it with more 
federal funding -- it can't work, because it attempts to solve local problems 
with centralized government solutions, and because it attempts to help 
individuals -- feeling, thinking human beings -- with the anonymous, antiseptic 
machinery of state. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I'm asking you to imagine an America in which each citizen looks around their 
communities and takes ownership, takes responsibility for at least one problem 
or one person who needs help. . . . The cynics who question the feasibility of 
community-based solutions suffer from nothing less than a failure of the 
imagination -- a pinched view of the generosity of the American people that is, 
thankfully, not shared by the American people themselves. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The third reason is that I have dared to question the gospel according to the 
Capital Gang. I have dared to mention that controversial three-letter word, God 
, and I have had the impudence to suggest that as a society we have forgotten 
him, that we should remember him, that we should -- undeterred by the ridicule 
of the liberal elite -- welcome God back into our lives and into our public 
square. . . . While it has become acceptable to discuss values, the giver of 
all values, God, remains taboo. I have broken the silence. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth reason is that my campaign challenges the liberal Establishment's 
presumption of moral superiority. Republicans aren't supposed to show homeless 
people and volunteers in their campaign commercials as I have. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So what my campaign is about is not just being against something, but being 
for something -- a new vision of how politics could and should work in America. 
My opponent says I have no ideas, but the truth is that my ideas are beyond the 
horizon of her worldview. What little she does comprehend, she does not like 
one bit, and neither does the liberal Establishment she represents. What my 
campaign has done is the political equivalent of showing up at the 
candle-makers union with a flashlight in hand. They do not want to see the 
light. What's more, they do not want others, especially the voters, to see the 
light. 
</P>
<P>
 Because when the light goes on, we will realize that for years we've been a 
democracy in the dark, voting, again and again, in the ignorance enforced by 
those whose whole lives, and livelihoods, and identities are dependent upon 
selling political candles in the dark. My campaign is about turning on the 
light.

DECISION '94 / SPECIAL GUIDE TO CALIFORNIA'S ELECTIONS; STATEWIDE RACES; ABOUT 
THESE RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than at any time in the recent past, voters making choices for statewide 
offices will be electing a field of newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the statewide contests below the rank of governor and U.S. senator, only 
the attorney general's race features an incumbent seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the candidates are seasoned politicians in other arenas, but six of 
the winners will be rookies in their elected posts. Any of these positions can 
be springboards for higher office. On this page and the following two pages is 
a look at these statewide races and the four minor parties with candidates on 
the ballot.

DECISION '94 / SPECIAL GUIDE TO CALIFORNIA'S ELECTIONS; STATEWIDE RACES; BALLOT 
OFFERS FOUR ALTERNATIVES TO VOTING DEMOCRATIC, REPUBLICAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 D emocrat and Republican aren't the only choices for voters. Four other 
parties have qualified by election rules to list candidates on California's 
ballots. Here are the parties and what they stand for: American Independent 
</P>
<P>
 The American Independent Party is committed to the principle that government's 
powers must be carefully divided and limited to safeguard individuals' rights. 
Members believe in traditional moral values and seek to preserve the right to 
keep and bear arms set forth in the 2nd Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Issues: American Independent Party members support strong action to stop 
illegal immigration. They seek to cut taxes, regulations and government waste. 
They support ending foreign aid and seek a trade policy that puts Americans 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 * Membership: About 237,000 Californians are registered with the American 
Independent Party -- or 1.65% of all voters. 
</P>
<P>
 * Candidates: Jerome McCready, a Castroville businessman, for governor; Paul 
Meeuwenberg, a Los Angeles marketing consultant, for U.S. Senate; Dorothy 
Robbins of Redding for secretary of state; Robert Lewis, a Los Angeles 
repairman, for lieutenant governor; Nathan Johnson of San Diego for controller; 
George M. McCoy, an Anza trade school instructor, for treasurer; A. Jacques, a 
retired criminologist, for insurance commissioner. Green 
</P>
<P>
 California's newest political party, the Green Party, was founded on 10 key 
values: protecting the environment, democracy, fairness, nonviolence, making 
government more local, equality, respect for diversity, responsibility, 
community-based economics and future focus. 
</P>
<P>
 * Issues: Green Party members believe that all life is interconnected and 
dependent upon the world's natural systems. They seek social justice based on 
honoring diversity, self-determination and self-definition of all people. 
</P>
<P>
 * Membership: About 85,000 Californians are registered with the Green Party -- 
or 0.59% of all voters. The California Green Party is part of a global network 
of Green parties in 73 countries. 
</P>
<P>

 THE OFFICE 
</P>
<P>
 Duties of the state's No. 2 office include the largely ceremonial and 
seldom-performed task of presiding over the state Senate; assuming duties of 
governor in event of the chief executive's impeachment, death, resignation, 
removal from office or absence from the state; chairing the Economic 
Development Commission, and sitting on about six boards and commissions, 
including the University of California Board of Regents, the State Board of 
Equalization and the State Lands Commission. MAJOR PARTY CANDIDATES 
</P>
<P>
 GRAY DAVIS, Democrat 
</P>
<P>
 * Born: Dec. 26, 1942, New York City 
</P>
<P>
 * Residence: West Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 * Current Position: State controller 
</P>
<P>
 * Education: Bachelor's degree, Stanford University; law degree, Columbia 
University 
</P>
<P>
 * Career highlights: Served as a captain in U.S. Army, earning Bronze Star for 
service in Vietnam, 1969; chief of staff to ex-Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown 
Jr., 1975-1981; member of the state Assembly, 1982-1986; state controller, 
1987-present. 
</P>
<P>
 * Family: Married 
</P>
<P>
 * Background: A well-known figure in California politics, Davis is attempting 
to move up from the office of state controller. As controller, Davis says he's 
been forced to clean up messes made by other officials, such as the IOUs he 
issued in 1992 after Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature were embroiled in a 
protracted budget stalemate. Among achievements that Davis cites in his current 
job are his recent role in persuading Taco Bell Corp. to stay in California and 
publicizing a $2.7-billion accounting error that threatened to undermine Gov. 
Pete Wilson's budget. Davis also has earned points with environmentalists for 
fighting offshore oil drilling. And he reminds voters that he supports abortion 
rights. Davis first drew attention as an aggressive, visible chief of staff to 
former Gov. Jerry Brown. His detractors have criticized Davis, elected to the 
Assembly in 1982, as an ambitious career politician. Immediately after his 
election as controller in 1986, he was accused of having state employees do 
political work for him while on state time. No charges were brought, but Davis 
reimbursed the state for employees' time and telephone charges. Last year, 
Davis was drawn into the spotlight again when it was reported that he had named 
political cronies and personal friends to lucrative part-time posts as probate 
referees. In response, Davis announced steps to reform the appointment process. 
After weathering rough political seas for two decades, Davis, who lost a bitter 
1992 U.S. Senate campaign, has emerged as the front-runner for lieutenant 
governor.

 CATHIE WRIGHT, Republican 
</P>
<P>
 * Born: May 18, 1929, Old Forge, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 * Residence: Simi Valley 
</P>
<P>
 * Current position: Member of the state Senate 
</P>
<P>
 * Education: Associate of arts degree in accounting from Lackawanna Jr. 
College, attended University of Scranton 
</P>
<P>
 * Family: Widowed; one child. 
</P>
<P>
 * Career highlights: Insurance underwriter, 1978-1980; elected to Simi Valley 
City Council, 1978; elected in 1980 to the state Assembly, where she served for 
12 years before moving up to the state Senate in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * Background: If she wins, Wright would become the first woman to capture the 
post of lieutenant governor. Wright lost three races for the Simi Valley City 
Council before she finally took a seat on her fourth attempt. Two years later 
in 1980, Wright, a former Democrat, was elected to the Assembly as a strong 
supporter of property tax-cutting Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Among her top accomplishments, Wright cites legislation to establish a 
comprehensive program to provide mental health services to seriously 
emotionally disturbed children. But after 14 years in the Legislature, 
conservative Wright, an opponent of abortion rights, is best known for her 
combative style and squabbles with other Republican legislators. After she 
failed to join them in a 1988 move to oust Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown, Wright's Assembly GOP colleagues unsuccessfully sought to dislodge her 
from a seat on the Rules Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time, Wright acknowledged that she had enlisted Brown's help 
when her daughter had run up a string of traffic tickets. A district attorney's 
investigation determined that Wright had tried to get police to void tickets 
issued to her or her daughter. However, the probe determined there were no 
clear-cut criminal violations that warranted prosecution. MINOR PARTY

<P>
 The Issues ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
<P>
 Davis says that 40 years ago, he and his family moved to California because 
the state offered the opportunity of a better life. Now, Davis says, with 
California's economy having soured, the state no longer symbolizes that promise 
of an unlimited future. As lieutenant governor, he would embark on an 
aggressive strategy to retain businesses and create new jobs. Wright, however, 
attempts to turn Davis' stint as chief of staff to former Gov. Jerry Brown into 
a liability, saying the "Brown-Davis" Administration reflected an anti-business 
philosophy that markedly increased the burden of regulation on business. Wright 
seeks to cut that burden and make state government more friendly toward 
business. HIGHER EDUCATION 
</P>
<P>
 Davis seeks to harness the brainpower of faculty and students at the 
University of California and the California State University systems to develop 
jobs in the state. He maintains that innovative ideas developed on California 
campuses should be put to use in the state, not overseas. Wright would launch 
financial audits to determine if there is waste in the administration of the 
state's universities and colleges and, if any is detected, the funds would be 
redirected to the classroom and to financial assistance for students. 
IMMIGRATION 
</P>
<P>
 Wright backs Proposition 187, which would cut most public benefits for illegal 
immigrants. In Wright's view, passage of the measure would send a loud message 
to Washington that Californians want quick action taken to staunch the flow of 
illegal immigrants across the Mexican border. Davis says he understands the 
frustration of people who favor the initiative but calls it the wrong solution 
to the problem. Davis favors bolstering the Border Patrol and persuading 
Washington to spend more money to handle illegal immigrants. COMPETENCE 
</P>
<P>
 Wright contends that Davis is not fit to step up to the lieutenant governor's 
seat. She says Davis doesn't perform his current duties, citing his failure to 
attend most meetings of the State Board of Equalization, of which he is 
currently a member. Davis says that as controller he is a member of 63 various 
boards and commissions and could not possibly find time to attend meetings of 
all the panels. Davis says he always sends a proxy if he can't attend a meeting 
and maintains he usually shows up for sessions of the more important boards, 
including the Lands Commission and the Franchise Tax Board. The controller 
questions Wright's ability as a legislator, describing her as an ineffective 
right-wing ideologue.;

SECRETARY OF STATE

<P>
 THE OFFICE 
</P>
<P>
 The Secretary of state is the state's chief elections officer, keeper of 
campaign and corporate records and a member of the state World Trade 
Commission. MAJOR PARTY CANDIDATES 
</P>
<P>
 BILL JONES, Republican 
</P>
<P>
 * Born: Dec. 20, 1949, in Coalinga 
</P>
<P>
 * Residence: Fresno 
</P>
<P>
 * Current position: Assembly member, part-time businessman-farmer 
</P>
<P>
 * Education: Bachelor's degree, Cal State Fresno 
</P>
<P>
 * Career highlights: Fresno County Republican Central Committee chairman, 
1975-76; Assembly member, 1982-present; Assembly Republican leader, 1991-92 
</P>
<P>
 * Family: Married, 2 children 
</P>
<P>
 * Background: During his 12 years representing the Fresno area in the 
Assembly, Jones has been a solidly conservative member of the Republican 
minority. But he has not been part of a doctrinaire inner circle often dubbed 
"the cavemen" for their often take-no-prisoners approach to politics. When 
moderates in 1991 decided to oust the Assembly Republican leader, they turned 
to the more genial Jones as his replacement. Jones lasted less than two years 
on the job, stepping down after the Assembly lost two Republican seats in the 
1992 elections. As an Assemblyman, Jones was the farmers' best friend in the 
Legislature, often carrying measures protective of the agriculture industry and 
its use of pesticides. Like most of his fellow Republicans, he often took 
positions strongly opposed by environmental groups. Now he says that his 
generally pro-business, anti-regulation views have become mainstream, even in a 
Legislature dominated by Democrats. Jones' biggest claim to legislative 
prominence came this year when he co-authored the "three strikes" crime measure 
that is now law.The legislation was the idea of Fresno resident Mike Reynolds, 
whose daughter was murdered in a 1992 robbery outside of a restaurant.

 TONY MILLER, Democrat 
</P>
<P>
 * Born: June 29, 1948, Westwood (Lassen County) 
</P>
<P>
 * Residence: Pleasant Grove 
</P>
<P>
 * Current position: Acting secretary of state 
</P>
<P>
 * Education: Bachelor's degree, UC Davis; law degree, Boalt Hall, UC Berkeley 
</P>
<P>
 * Career highlights: Member Fair Political Practices Commission, 1975-76; 
chief legal counsel, secretary of state's office, 1976-94; chief deputy 
secretary of state, 1981-1994; acting secretary of state, Feb. 1994-present. 
</P>
<P>
 * Family: Unmarried 
</P>
<P>
 * Background: Miller has spent the last 18 years -- the largest part of his 
professional life -- working for Secretary of State March Fong Eu. Miller 
became acting secretary of state in February, when Eu stepped down to become 
ambassador to Micronesia. Under Eu, Miller had broad responsibilities for the 
office, including administering fines for politicians, lobbyists and 
contributors who were late in filing required financial disclosure reports. 
Opponents have tried to tar him for Eu's longstanding practice of reducing or 
waiving many of the fines where the failures were "non-willful," as permitted 
by a 1975 law. Over the years, as chief deputy, Miller spared violators 
millions of dollars in fines, but he says he was evenhanded, treating Democrats 
and Republicans alike. Miller takes some credit for many of Eu's achievements 
in office, including creation of the state World Trade Commission, registration 
by mail and voting by mail. As deputy secretary of state, Miller has shown new 
boldness. Though results were minimal, he urged lobbyists to register with his 
office to put candidates on notice not to solicit them for campaign 
contributions. For the first time, all statewide candidates were given free 
space in the ballot pamphlet sent out to all registered voters. MINOR PARTY

 The Issues VOTER FRAUD 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Jones contends that California's voter rolls are filled with 
"deadwood" -- duplicate records for people who have moved to another county and 
ghost registrations for those who have moved to another state or died. He 
claims that they add up to as much as 15% of those registered, or 2 million 
people. He also contends that many non-citizens -- those here legally and 
illegally -- are on the rolls and that unknown numbers are voting. The system, 
he says, is ripe for election fraud. Democrat Miller contends that Jones has 
exaggerated the size and effect of the problem. Having deadwood on the 
registration rolls is not the same as casting fraudulent ballots, he says, and 
there is no evidence of significant fraud. MOTOR VOTER 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever is secretary of state will oversee implementation of the new National 
Voter Registration Act -- called "motor voter" because it requires states to 
allow voters to register when they apply for driver's licenses or other 
government services. Democratic politicians generally like "motor voter" 
because it expands their voting pool, while Republicans argue that it is 
already easy enough for citizens to register. Miller promises to move ahead 
vigorously with the new law when it goes into effect Jan. 1. Jones says that 
unlike some Republicans, he is committed to expanding efforts to sign up new 
voters. But fellow Republican Gov. Pete Wilson has ordered state agencies not 
to move ahead with motor voter unless the federal government provides the money 
needed to put it into effect. If Wilson is reelected and sticks by his 
executive order, Miller vows to take him to court on Jan. 2. Jones has been 
ambiguous about what he would do, other than talk to Wilson about his position. 
CAMPAIGN REFORM 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates want to end the accelerating campaign arms race by putting a 
limit on campaign contributions from individuals, corporations and political 
action committees. Jones wants to restore the contribution limits in 
Proposition 73, a voter-approved initiative that was struck down in the federal 
courts. Miller wants to reimpose contribution limits but goes further -- 
calling for spending limits for candidates as well. However, the U.S. Supreme 
Court has barred mandatory spending limits as a violation of the free speech 
rights of candidates, so limits must be voluntary. One way to get candidates in 
contested races to agree to limits is to offer them public funding as an 
inducement to accept a spending cap. Like Jones, Miller opposes using tax 
dollars for campaigns. Miller's alternative: Let candidates who agree to a 
spending cap take larger contributions than those who don't. For example, a 
candidate who agreed to limit spending could take up to $1,000 from an 
individual, while a candidate who won't agree to a limit would be restricted to 
$100. Oakland is experimenting with such a system. CORPORATE RECORDS 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary of state's office is home for a host of corporate records. Jones 
faults Miller and his former boss, Eu, for problems the office had installing 
computerized systems, particularly for tracking commercial loans and liens 
under the Uniform Commercial Code. Access to those records is important to the 
availability of business loans in the state. Miller admits that the office's 
first attempt to computerize these records in 1989 was a failure, blaming a 
contractor that did not do the job. He says the office recovered the money that 
was paid to the contractor and hired a new one. The new system was fully 
installed this summer.

DECISION '94 / SPECIAL GUIDE TO CALIFORNIA'S ELECTIONS; STATEWIDE RACES; STATE 
CONTROLLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 THE OFFICE 
</P>
<P>
 The controller is the state's chief fiscal officer and bookkeeper, whose 
signature appears on billions of dollars worth of state payments, from income 
tax rebates to purchases from vendors. The controller also tracks down 
abandoned or forgotten bank accounts for their owners. Much of the controller's 
power stems from membership on a wide variety of boards and commissions that 
affect public policy. For example, the controller serves on the tax-collecting 
Board of Equalization and Franchise Tax Board, public employee pension agencies 
and the State Lands Commission. MAJOR PARTY CANDIDATES 
</P>
<P>
 KATHLEEN CONNELL, Democrat 
</P>
<P>
 * Born: June 30, 1947, in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 * Residence: Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * Education: Bachelor's degree, Hastings College; master's degree, University 
of Pittsburgh, doctorate, UCLA 
</P>
<P>
 * Current position: Owner and president of Connell and Associates, a Los 
Angeles-based investment banking company 
</P>
<P>
 * Career highlights: Founding director of the Center for Finance and Real 
Estate at UCLA; former vice president of Chemical Bank of New York specializing 
in public finance; for six years, director of Los Angeles Department of Housing 
during the Bradley Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 * Family: Married, two children 
</P>
<P>
 * Background: Connell describes herself as a "fiscal conservative and social 
moderate." As a political newcomer, she says she carries no political baggage 
into the race for state controller, her first run for public office. Until she 
became a Democrat last year, Connell was registered as a voter who declined to 
state a party preference. Connell holds six licenses from the federal 
Securities and Exchange Commission and displays an almost laser-like focus on 
what she says she would do if elected. She says she is qualified to be 
controller because of her professional and academic experience in the area of 
public finance. In her business, she lists among her clients the cities of Los 
Angeles, Santa Monica and San Diego. Connell says that during her tenure as 
director of housing in Los Angeles from 1977 to 1983, she was responsible for 
creating or rehabilitating more than 10,000 units of affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 But her opponent, Republican Tom McClintock, charges that the housing agency 
went bankrupt under her "mismanagement." Connell denies the bankruptcy 
allegation, but her campaign concedes that start-up problems bedeviled the 
fledgling department. Aides say there was plenty of blame to go around, 
including the borrowing of funds by the City Council for other purposes. 
Connell says that City Council members who criticized her at the time have 
since endorsed her candidacy for controller.

 TOM McCLINTOCK, Republican 
</P>
<P>
 * Born: July 10, 1956, in White Plains, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 * Residence: Rocklin 
</P>
<P>
 * Current position: Founding director of the Center for the California 
Taxpayer 
</P>
<P>
 * Education: Bachelor's degree, UCLA 
</P>
<P>
 * Career highlights: Chief of staff to former state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa 
Clarita) from 1980-82; in 1982, at age 26, elected to the state Assembly from a 
Ventura County district; served 10 years and built a reputation as a credible 
conservative spokesman on fiscal issues; defeated for election to Congress in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * Family: Married, two children 
</P>
<P>
 * Background: As a member of the "caveman" faction of conservative Assembly 
Republicans, McClintock was arguably the most tightfisted in the lower house on 
taxation and fiscal issues. His attacks against government spending became 
legendary, even against leaders of his own party -- Govs. George Deukmejian and 
Pete Wilson. McClintock proposed long lists of spending cuts. Most, however, 
were deemed unrealistic and few became law. For a time, McClintock flirted with 
the notion of challenging Wilson for reelection, but decided instead to run for 
state controller. Although he was popular with colleagues in the Legislature, 
McClintock was viewed by some as less than effective because of his stiff 
refusal to compromise. Besides his fiscal thriftiness, he is identified with 
the anti-abortion movement and favors gun-owner rights. He is the author of the 
state law that gives Death Row convicts the choice of execution by gas or 
injection. McClintock said he carried the lethal injection bill not to spare 
inmates suffering, but to make sure the death penalty was carried out if gas 
was found to be unconstitutional. A federal court judge recently ruled death by 
gas in California to be cruel and unusual punishment. MINOR PARTY CANDIDATES

 The Issues BUSINESS CLIMATE 
</P>
<P>
 Both major candidates view the controller's office as a tool to stimulate 
economic recovery for California. Both say they favor more investments of 
public employee pension funds into job-producing California industries. AUDITS 
</P>
<P>
 McClintock and Connell favor aggressive use of the controller's auditing 
authority to uncover and eliminate governmental waste, but take different 
tacks. McClintock favors use of existing audit procedures aimed chiefly at 
fiscal issues, while Connell supports performance audits that analyze 
productivity. McClintock says performance audits can be time-consuming and 
there is no time to spare. Additionally, he says, wasteful practices are not 
hard to find. Connell says the task isn't merely locating and eliminating 
waste, but also involves determining if a government program has appropriate 
objectives and is meeting the needs of taxpayers. She maintains that 
performance audits would provide an objective guide on whether programs should 
be maintained, reformed or thrown out. IMMIGRATION 
</P>
<P>
 On the Proposition 187 illegal immigration initiative, McClintock is a 
supporter and Connell an opponent. McClintock says as controller he would 
refuse to approve payments that "fund state giveaways to illegals." He says 
such payments amount to $3.4 billion that California taxpayers provide to 
undocumented immigrants as a result of an "outdated" U.S. Supreme Court ruling 
in 1982. Connell says she is "totally appalled" by the failure of the Clinton 
Administration and Congress to fully reimburse California for its health, 
education and penal costs associated with illegal immigration. But she says she 
opposes Proposition 187 on grounds that it could end up costing California $15 
billion in federal health, education and welfare funds. CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS 
</P>
<P>
 As a virtual unknown in statewide politics, Connell has raised at least $2.2 
million for her campaign, including $1.6 million in loans from herself and her 
husband, developer Robert Levenstein. By contrast, McClintock, heading into the 
final weeks of the campaign, had received $737,000, mostly in relatively small 
donations. His largest single contribution, $15,000, came from Taxpayers 
Political Action Commmittee, an organization of oil, railroad, telephone and 
electric companies. Connell's contributors include traditional Democratic 
supporters such as organized labor, but also Southern California investors, 
developers, entertainment figures and attorneys.;

<P>
 * Education: Bachelor's degree, University of Notre Dame; law degree, 
Georgetown University 
</P>
<P>
 * Career highlights: Elected to Congress in 1978 and served five terms. 
Nominated as state treasurer, but rejected by Democrat-dominated Legislature in 
1988. Won narrow victory over Democrat Arlo Smith in 1990 attorney general 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 * Family: Married, three children 
</P>
<P>
 * Background: An unabashed conservative, Lungren is widely regarded as the 
Republican Party's most likely nominee for governor in 1998. He has spent large 
amounts of time in Washington as a student, staffer on the Republican National 
Committee and congressman, prompting some observers to speculate that Lungren 
is infected with "Potomac fever" and will instead run for the U.S. Senate. 
Lungren grew up in Long Beach, the son of a doctor who served as Richard 
Nixon's physician in the 1950s. During his decade in Congress, Lungren was 
regarded as bright and ideologically passionate, but with a pragmatic core. He 
helped win passage of a watershed crime package as well as the 1986 immigration 
act.

<P>
 * Current position: Member of the Assembly

</P>
<P>
 * Career highlights: Former military prosecutor and assistant U.S. attorney. 
Elected to Assembly in 1990, becoming the only Orange County Democrat holding 
state or federal office. Reelected in 1992 with 60% of vote. 
</P>
<P>
 * Family: Married, three children 
</P>
<P>
 * Background: Should he win, Umberg would become the first challenger in 
modern times to defeat a sitting attorney general. Although only a two-term 
assemblyman, he gained enough support from Democratic powerbrokers to scare San 
Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith, who lost narrowly to Lungren in 1990, out of 
the June primary. After law school, he became a military prosecutor, then 
served as an assistant U.S. attorney in Orange County, prosecuting cases 
involving drugs, white-collar crime and a headline-grabbing cross-burning 
incident. He vaulted to Sacramento after defeating an incumbent Republican in a 
nasty 1990 election confrontation. But in the Capitol he earned a reputation as 
an earnest, hard-working moderate. As a member of the Assembly Public Safety 
Committee, the Democrat-dominated graveyard for GOP crime bills, he 
consistently cast votes for law-and-order issues. MINOR PARTY CANDIDATES

<P>
 The Issues 'THREE STRIKES' 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren takes credit as the first politician to help Mike Reynolds, the Fresno 
photographer who launched the "three strikes" movement in California. The 
attorney general supported the bill signed into law this year and the 
initiative on the November ballot. Umberg, who voted for the law when it first 
appeared in 1993, contends that Lungren did not surface on the issue until it 
became a hot topic this year. Although he supports the initiative, Umberg 
worries about the potential for prison overcrowding. His own version of the 
"three strikes" bill focused only on the most violent criminals. CRIME RATE 
</P>
<P>
 A battle of statistics among the candidates. Umberg argues that the number of 
crimes in California has risen 2.1% since Lungren took office, with violent 
incidents swelling 7.8%. He questions whether voters feel "as safe today as 
they did four years ago." Lungren notes that crime dropped during the first six 
months of 1994 and the per-capita rate has fallen during his tenure. He 
expresses hope that it is the start of a downward trend prompted by tougher new 
laws, but says much more must be done. GUN CONTROL 
</P>
<P>
 Neither supports a ban on all guns, but both get failing grades from the gun 
lobby. Lungren has irked gun owners by siding with Democrats on the state's 
assault weapons ban. He notes that his office enforced the state's 15-day 
waiting period for gun purchases, turning down 6,500 buyers in 1993. But he 
opposes proposals to ban cheap "Saturday night specials," saying it would strip 
the poor of the right to own a gun for protection. Umberg supports the waiting 
period, the assault weapons ban and wants to see more copycat weapons banned. 
He carried legislation designed to improve gun safety, particularly for 
households with children. ENVIRONMENT 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg, chairman of the Assembly Toxics Committee, charges that Lungren has 
slashed the Justice Department's environmental division and compromised on 
settlement of environmental cases. He says a $40-million settlement negotiated 
by Lungren for a toxic spill in Dunsmuir in rural Northern California was not 
enough. Lungren counters that he has done a fair job of weighing environmental 
and business interests. He contends that the Dunsmuir settlement was fair and 
helped speed restoration work. Lungren prodded the wine industry to remove lead 
from the foil that caps bottles, but rejected a $3-million settlement suggested 
by his staff and accepted $900,000 from the vintners instead. GAMBLING 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren has made regulation of the state's gambling industry a top priority. 
He pushed unsuccessfully this year to establish an independent commission to 
license and regulate the industry. But he also took nearly $20,000 in campaign 
contributions from Nevada casinos and a Southern California card club. Umberg 
supports efforts to regulate the gambling industry, but suggests that there are 
higher priorities such as juvenile crime. He has collected more than $40,000 
from Native American tribes that own casinos. OPERATION OF OFFICE 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg contends that the incumbent skewed priorities by cutting the consumer 
protection and environmental enforcement divisions of the Department of 
Justice. He notes that the sex offender registration effort is flagging and 
that fingerprint collection lags 80 days. He says Lungren failed to properly 
fund a statewide computerized database that would have helped in the Polly 
Klaas murder-kidnap case. Lungren takes credit for slicing into management fat. 
He blames many of the problems on cuts by the Legislature. He contends that a 
computer database that might have helped in the Klaas case was in the midst of 
getting funded when the crime occurred. BULLY PULPIT 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren has used his post to rail against the "culture of violence" in video 
games, rap music lyrics and professional football. Umberg contends that the 
pulpit should be used to highlight juvenile crime, in particular the link 
between illiteracy and criminals.;

 THE OFFICE 
</P>
<P>
 As the state's banker, the treasurer cashes the state's checks, manages the 
state's deposits and investments and borrows money on behalf of the state by 
issuing billions of dollars in bonds. The treasurer serves on numerous boards 
and commissions, including the boards of the public employee and teacher 
pension funds, which together manage the largest pool of retirement accounts in 
the country. MAJOR PARTY CANDIDATES 
</P>
<P>
 MATT FONG, Republican 
</P>
<P>
 * Born: Nov. 20, 1953, Oakland 
</P>
<P>
 * Residence: Hacienda Heights 
</P>
<P>
 * Current position: Member of the State Board of Equalization representing Los 
Angeles County 
</P>
<P>
 * Education: Bachelor's degree, United States Air Force Academy; master's 
degree, Pepperdine University, law degree, Southwestern School of Law 
</P>
<P>
 * Career highlights: 1991 appointed as member State Board of Equalization; 
attorney specializing in international business law; service in Air Force; 
founded a small import/export company; managed the successful 1982 campaign of 
his mother, March Fong Eu, for secretary of state before switching from 
Democrat to Republican; 1990 defeated in a race for controller, co-chairman of 
both of George Bush's campaigns for President in California. 
</P>
<P>
 * Family: Married to Paula Fong; two children 
</P>
<P>
 * Background: For much of Fong's term on the five-member State Board of 
Equalization, Republicans have been in the minority and he has been powerless 
to influence its direction. Nevertheless, after the board lost a court suit 
challenging the way it assessed property owned by utilities, Fong is credited 
with engineering a settlement agreement that saved counties from having to give 
the utility companies nearly $1 billion in tax refunds. 
</P>
<P>
 In his Los Angeles district, Fong was also able to save the state an estimated 
$1 million a year by consolidating seven offices into four. During his tenure, 
he improved the efficiency of his office, substantially reducing the time 
taxpayers had to wait for service. He made himself vulnerable to attacks from 
his opponent, however, by choosing to lease office space from development 
interests who then gave him a free office for his campaign.

 PHIL ANGELIDES, Democrat 
</P>
<P>
 * Born: June 12, 1953, Sacramento 
</P>
<P>
 * Residence: Sacramento 
</P>
<P>
 * Current Position: President and owner of River West Developments, a land 
development/site construction management company 
</P>
<P>
 * Education: Bachelor's degree, Harvard University 
</P>
<P>
 * Career highlights: Housing administrator for former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) 
Brown Jr.; chief of staff for former Assembly Majority Leader Michael Roos 
(D-Los Angeles); headed Sacramento land development company, later formed own 
development company; 1990-93 state Democratic Party chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 * Family: Married to Julie Angelides, three children 
</P>
<P>
 * Background: Like his opponent, Angelides has never won an elected office. 
His only other attempts at seeking public office came when he was in his early 
20s and twice ran unsuccessfully for the Sacramento City Council. He was 
co-chairman in California of the campaigns of Michael Dukakis for President in 
1988 and Dianne Feinstein for governor in 1992. In 1991, as state Democratic 
Party chairman, he was given credit for bolstering the party's fund raising and 
increasing party registration. Angelides drew national recognition for the 
design of Laguna West, a large-scale planned community in suburban Sacramento. 
The development includes a town center and requires front porches, bicycle 
paths and access to mass transit. The development became an issue in the 
Democratic primary this year when former Senate President Pro Tem David A. 
Roberti (D-Van Nuys) accused Angelides of bailing out of the project to escape 
financial trouble. Angelides maintained that he divested himself of interest in 
several dozen ventures in order to run for office. MINOR PARTY CANDIDATES

</P>
<P>
 The two major candidates bill themselves as businessmen who would bring better 
fiscal management to the treasurer's office as well as state government. In the 
final days of the campaign, they have unleashed a multimillion-dollar 
advertising barrage against each other. JOBS 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates promise to create more jobs by pushing the two state 
retirement systems to invest at least 3% to 4% more of their funds in 
California. Fong said his plan would produce 250,000 more jobs while Angelides 
said his would produce 100,000 jobs. BORROWING 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates vow to use the power of the state treasurer's office to put 
the brakes on state borrowing. Angelides said he would not allow the governor 
and Legislature to continue short-term borrowing to relieve the state's budget 
shortages. "I do not intend to afford the Legislature and the governor with an 
open-ended credit card," he said. Fong said he would slow the sale of bonds, 
limiting them to those revenue measures that target critical areas such as 
education and prisons. "The treasurer can say 'enough is enough' on bonds," he 
said. WASTE 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates say they plan to streamline the operation of the state 
treasurer's office. Angelides said, "My gut tells me that I will not have 
trouble cutting 10% to 20% from the operation." Fong said he would eliminate 
waste in the operation too but does not use a specific percentage. 
CONTRIBUTIONS 
</P>
<P>
 Angelides has accused Fong of accepting campaign contributions from business 
interests who appeared before him on the Board of Equalization after promising 
that he wouldn't. Fong has said he never made any such promises and has 
criticized Angelides for accepting campaign money from bond houses that may do 
business with the state treasurer's office. Angelides said that the 
contributions were only a small part of his total collections -- 1% -- and that 
they would not influence his decisions. Fong refused to accept bond house 
contributions. INVESTMENTS 
</P>
<P>
 Each has said he would urge the two pension boards to pressure corporations in 
which they have invested heavily to stop giving huge compensation packages to 
top executives, especially when earnings are soft.FONG, MATTHEW (;

SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 THE OFFICE 
</P>
<P>
 As chief advocate for public education, the superintendent oversees day-to-day 
operations of the 2,200-employee state Department of Education. Within the 
state's 5.2-million student system of schools, the officeholder also helps 
local districts carry out policies set by the governor-appointed State Board of 
Education, distributes about $29 billion in federal, state and local school 
funds and helps develop curriculum, school reform efforts, student assessment 
and teacher training. The superintendent also is a member of the University of 
California Board of Regents and an ex-officio member of the Cal State 
University Board of Trustees. The post is the only statewide constitutional 
office that is designated nonpartisan. MAJOR CANDIDATES 
</P>
<P>
 MAUREEN DI MARCO 
</P>
<P>
 * Born: Aug. 2, 1948, Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 * Residence: Cypress 
</P>
<P>
 * Current position: California secretary of child development and education 
</P>
<P>
 * Education: Attended Glendale Community College, USC and Western State 
University Law School 
</P>
<P>
 * Career highlights: A Democrat, she was appointed by Republican Gov. Pete 
Wilson in 1991, as state's first Cabinet-level education adviser. Began as a 
volunteer in her children's classrooms, elected to the Garden Grove school 
board, was president of the California School Boards Assn., served as a 
consultant to former Supt. Bill Honig.  
</P>
<P>
 * Family: Married to Richard DiMarco; two children 
</P>
<P>
 * Background: As consultant to Honig, DiMarco participated in fashioning 
landmark school reform legislation in 1983, which beefed up high school 
graduation requirements and lengthened the school day and year. While working 
for Wilson, she helped initiate such programs as providing health and social 
services on school campuses with large numbers of needy students, expanding the 
state's preschool program and starting a new teacher-intern program.  
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco's defense of Wilson's budget policies during the recession -- in 
essence keeping per-pupil spending the same for three years, with no allowance 
for rising costs -- has been seized upon as a major campaign theme by opponent 
Delaine Eastin, who charges that the governor gives prisons a higher priority 
than schools.  
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco pledges to help "get the politics and bickering" out of education, 
work for improvement in basic academic skills, make schools safer and give 
local districts more say in how their schools are run. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 DELAINE EASTIN 
</P>
<P>
 * Born: Aug. 20, 1947, San Diego 
</P>
<P>
 * Residence: Fremont 
</P>
<P>
 * Current position: Member of California Assembly 
</P>
<P>
 * Education: Bachelor's degree, UC Davis; master's degree, UC Santa Barbara 
</P>
<P>
 * Career highlights: A Democrat elected to the Assembly in 1986, Eastin has 
chaired its Education Committee for four years. Before entering politics, she 
was a community college government instructor for seven years, then worked as a 
manager at Pacific Bell during the court-ordered breakup of the Bell telephone 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 * Family: Married to Jack Saunders; no children 
</P>
<P>
 * Background: The combative Eastin helped lead a successful fight during the 
1992 budget negotiations to protect schools from deeper cuts. She has penned a 
wide range of education bills, including a measure that resulted in tighter 
fiscal controls on local school systems after the financial collapse of the 
Richmond Unified School District in the Bay Area. She also pushed through bills 
to "cut red tape in the education code" and to modernize libraries, both of 
which were signed by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin's strong alliance with the powerful California Teachers Assn. has made 
her vulnerable to accusations that she could not be an independent leader on 
education issues. In particular, she fought unsuccessfully for CTA-sought 
conditions in the state's 1992 charter school law, which grants selected 
schools great autonomy and freedom from most district and state regulations.  
</P>
<P>
 The assemblywoman promises to be a "bureaucracy buster" and to "fight to put 
kids first" through cleaner and more modern schools, higher academic standards, 
education reforms and increased parental and business involvement. The Issues 
</P>
<P>
 Separated by few ideological differences, the candidates nevertheless fault 
each other on specific issues as they tout their records and qualifications to 
overhaul California schools. The DiMarco campaign, trying to portray Eastin as 
the tool of special interests, says in an analysis of the assemblywoman's 
financial supporters that almost half of the $643,000 she raised between July 1 
and Sept. 30 came from labor unions and education employee groups. The Eastin 
campaign, noting that Wilson is raising money for the underfunded DiMarco, 
calls her an apologist for Wilson. STUDENT ASSESSMENT 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco drew criticism from education and business leaders when she 
successfully urged Wilson to veto legislation continuing the California 
Learning Assessment System, the state's widely heralded but problem-plagued 
student testing program. She helped shape the 1991 law creating the system but 
said the program fashioned by the state Department of Education strayed too far 
from the law's intent. But Eastin said CLAS' problems were fixable, and the 
governor's veto wasted the $50 million spent to date and put the state farther 
behind in getting a testing system that would help drive school reforms. SCHOOL 
FUNDING 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates support giving local school districts broader taxing authority 
by allowing them to raise levies with the consent of a majority of voters 
instead of the two-thirds approval now required. IMMIGRATION 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates oppose Proposition 187, the measure on the ballot that would 
deny public education and most health care services to illegal immigrant 
children. Instead, Eastin said, the state must get help from the federal 
government but also "must crack down" on firms that employ illegal immigrants. 
DiMarco disagrees with Wilson on this ballot measure, saying the solutions lie 
"at the border and in Washington" and not at the schools. L.A. UNIFIED 
</P>
<P>
 Neither candidate is supporting a proposed breakup of the Los Angeles Unified 
School District. DiMarco said that "just redrawing the boundaries" will not 
result in improvements. "We need to figure out what kids need" before taking a 
stand on the breakup proposal, she added. Eastin said studies have shown there 
is "no optimum size" for a district. "There is no magic in the numbers," she 
said. "LEARN" 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin is a "big supporter" of the Los Angeles Educational Alliance for 
Restructuring Now, which seeks to improve schools by giving each campus and its 
parents, teachers and community leaders broad decision-making powers. DiMarco 
is skeptical that the local business community-led LEARN will produce 
substantive improvements in student achievement. CRIME ON CAMPUS 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates call for "zero tolerance" of weapons and drugs in schools. 
Eastin supports conflict-resolution training for students, as well as building 
stronger school-community partnerships and providing more after-school programs 
and wider course offerings "to engage kids and give them a sense they have a 
future." DiMarco also advocates dispute-resolution training as well as 
expanding the anti-drug DARE program and hooking classrooms into the 911 
system.;

 THE ISSUES 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman says he would alter California's method of taxing multinational 
corporations. The board gives these corporations, he says, the option of using 
either the worldwide system, which California invented, or the separate 
accounting system, which the Internal Revenue Service and most other states 
employ. He says he would work to mandate the exclusive use of the separate 
accounting system. Dynda disagrees, saying he believes any changes might give 
some companies a loophole to cheat California out of taxes. District 1 
</P>
<P>
 The district covers an area in Northern California. The major party candidates 
are Johan Klehs, a Democratic assemblyman, and Robert (Bob) Strawn, a 
Republican businessman. Minor party: Kennita Watson, Libertarian.

DECISION '94 / SPECIAL GUIDE TO CALIFORNIA'S ELECTIONS; PROP. 187; 187: DENIES 
SERVICES TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 P roposition 187 proposes action in several major areas: education, health, 
social services and law enforcement. Following is a summary of how the measure 
would impact each area and arguments for and against its passage. SCHOOLS 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT IT DOES 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 requires educational administrators to verify the legal status 
of each child -- and their parents -- enrolled in public elementary and 
secondary schools. Children who cannot prove they are citizens or lawfully 
admitted immigrants would be barred from school after a 90-day period. School 
administrators would also be required to forward the names of suspected illegal 
immigrant children and parents to the INS, the state attorney general and state 
superintendent of public instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Estimates by various authorities have placed the number of students statewide 
who could be expelled as a result of this provision at between 300,000 and 
400,000. The annual savings for excluding 300,000 students could amount to $1.2 
billion annually. However, passage of Proposition 187 would put at risk $2.3 
billion in annual federal education funding because the reporting of suspected 
illegal immigrants appears to violate the provisions of a federal educational 
privacy act, according to the state legislative analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other provisions of the ballot measure, which would take effect 
immediately upon passage, verification of the legal status of children 
enrolling in school for the first time would begin Jan. 1, 1995. By Jan. 1, 
1996, the status of current students and their parents would have to be 
checked. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides agree that passage of Proposition 187 would result in a legal 
challenge. In order for this component of the law to take effect, the U.S. 
Supreme Court would have to ignore or reverse its decision in the 1982 Plyler 
vs. Doe case, which made it unconstitutional to deny public education to 
undocumented school-age children. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposition includes a clause, common in statewide initiatives, saying 
that if any portion of the measure is held invalid, other portions would remain 
in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 * ARGUMENTS FOR 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors say that by reducing the number of students in schools across 
California, classroom overcrowding and educational costs would be significantly 
reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's student-to-teacher ratio could be decreased, costly bilingual 
programs could be reduced and the quality of education could be improved for 
students who are legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The process of verifying legal status would not require major bureaucratic 
entanglements since school administrators already are responsible for receiving 
identification documents and health records for students enrolling in school. 
Students who do not produce documents will be reported to the INS so they can 
be returned to their home countries to receive an education. 
</P>
<P>
 A challenge of the Plyler vs. Doe decision could force the Supreme Court, 
which now includes six new members, to reverse its decision, allowing this 
measure, and similar ones that other states might be encouraged to enact, to 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
 * ARGUMENTS AGAINST 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say it is unfair to turn school administrators into 
quasi-immigration officers and immoral to turn children into scapegoats because 
their parents may have broken the nation's immigration laws. 
</P>
<P>
 If children are not educated, yet remain in the country, they are bound to be 
a costly, long-term burden to society. The measure provides no specific means 
of deporting illegal immigrants so most would remain in the state. Youngsters 
who are on the streets rather than in school would be more likely to turn to 
street gangs, drugs and lives of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some youngsters who are citizens could face problems remaining in school 
if their parents were reported to authorities as illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal challenge that would result if Proposition 187 passes would be 
costly, time-consuming and would, in all likelihood, result in the Supreme 
Court reaffirming its 1982 decision. If the sponsors of 187 were serious about 
saving taxpayers' money and wanted to challenge the court decision, opponents 
ask, why aren't they doing it without forcing taxpayers to foot the bill? 
PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT IT DOES: 
</P>
<P>
 The state's public colleges, universities and community colleges would be 
barred from admitting pupils who are not citizens or lawfully admitted 
immigrants. Administrators would be required to verify the legal status of all 
students and provide the names of those suspected of being illegal immigrants 
to state and federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Undocumented students currently taking courses for credit at community 
colleges or the University of California are required to pay non-resident 
tuition to cover the cost of their education. Students in the California State 
University system, in accord with a court ruling, pay in-state tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 * ARGUMENTS FOR 
</P>
<P>
 Those who break the law by being in California illegally should not be allowed 
to make use of the state's public services. 
</P>
<P>
 * ARGUMENTS AGAINST 
</P>
<P>
 There is no reason to penalize students who are paying their own way through 
school. The release of information to immigration authorities would violate 
federal privacy requirements and jeopardize at least $1.1 billion in federal 
funds subject to these standards. HEALTH CARE 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT IT DOES 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all health care clinics and hospitals would be barred from providing 
any services other than emergency medical care to anyone who cannot prove that 
he is a U.S. citizen, a lawfully admitted permanent resident or a lawfully 
permitted temporary visitor. The wording of the measure indicates that medical 
service could not be provided at publicly funded hospitals and clinics even if 
a patient was willing to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Those suspected of being illegal immigrants would be refused health care and 
would have their names forwarded to the state Director of Health Services, the 
state attorney general and the INS. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, illegal immigrants are eligible for prenatal services and nursing 
home care for the elderly and disabled. They also participate in public health 
programs such as immunizations and testing for sexually transmitted disease. 
Illegal immigrants are generally not eligible for non-emergency Medi-Cal 
services but can receive basic indigent health care service. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliminating these services would provide savings of more than $100 million a 
year, according to the legislative analyst, but also appears to run afoul of 
federal confidentiality requirements, placing at risk the approximately $9 
billion in annual federal funds California receives for its entire Medi-Cal 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 * ARGUMENTS FOR 
</P>
<P>
 In an ideal world, all people who need health care would receive it. But with 
health costs high, a system of rationing is required. Proposition 187 would 
accomplish that, saving taxpayers the expense of subsidizing the health care 
costs of those living in California illegally.  
</P>
<P>
 Strict controls on health care might even persuade illegal immigrants to leave 
California or not come here in the first place. Since illegal immigrants are 
not screened for diseases, any effort aimed at reducing their numbers might 
limit the spread of infectious diseases into the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure also does not preclude concerned opponents from setting up their 
own privately funded clinics to pay for and dispense vaccinations and other 
medical services. Sponsors of Proposition 187 have suggested that groups 
ranging from the Catholic Church to the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund could take over such services -- and remove the cost from 
taxpayers' wallets -- since they are so concerned about the rights of illegal 
immigrants. As for the $9 billion of at-risk funds, proponents say it is 
politically naive to think that the Clinton Administration, faced with a 1996 
national election, would deny billions of dollars of funds to California 
because the state refused to pay for services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 * ARGUMENTS AGAINST 
</P>
<P>
 Disease does not recognize borders or ask for green cards. Therefore, denying 
care to illegal immigrants could result in the spread of illnesses to the 
general population. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of preventive treatment, particularly for pregnant women, is likely 
to have much steeper long-term emergency medical costs, since children born in 
the United State are citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Already overcrowded emergency rooms would be further packed, and the measure, 
as written, might even prevent screening exams to determine whether an 
emergency exists when a patient arrives. Also unclear is just when an emergency 
is no longer an emergency, and therefore, when hospitals would have to report 
the legal status of patients who are illegal immigrants to federal authorities. 
Proposition 187 is likely to have such a chilling effect that illegal 
immigrants who need medical care might not seek it until it is too late. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would also turn doctors and nurses into quasi-immigration agents 
when their time is more properly spent dealing with the public health. SOCIAL 
SERVICES 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT IT DOES 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 requires the cutoff of all public social services to anyone 
other than U.S. citizens or immigrants lawfully admitted as permanent residents 
or temporary visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 All persons employed in providing these services would be called on to verify 
the legal status of applicants and turn in the names of anyone suspected of 
being an illegal immigrant to federal authorities and the state attorney 
general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigrants are already precluded from receiving most major publicly 
funded social service grants, including food stamps, unemployment insurance and 
welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 If Proposition 187 is approved, the list of banned services would be extended 
to child welfare and foster care benefits, publicly funded family planning 
programs and specialized government efforts targeting at-risk groups, including 
abused and parentless children, the elderly, blind, homeless, mentally impaired 
and drug abusers. 
</P>
<P>
 Passage of Proposition 187 could save counties and the state roughly $50 
million a year, the legislative analyst estimates. It would also put at risk 
about $3 billion in federal matching funds for Aid to Families With Dependent 
Children because the reporting requirement runs counter to federal 
confidentiality regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 * ARGUMENTS FOR 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigrants who are paid the minimum wage or even less for their labor 
cannot afford to live in many parts of California without supplementing their 
income with public benefits. For that reason, a certain percentage takes 
advantage of social service programs, if need be, by using false 
identifications.  
</P>
<P>
 Strict verification standards might make some illegal immigrants think twice 
about seeking social services they do not qualify for. Moreover, taxpayers 
should not have to pay for any services at all for those who enter the United 
States illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time an illegal immigrant takes advantage of a social service program, 
less money is available for American citizens. Moreover, politically speaking, 
it is silly to think that the federal government would cut off $3 billion in 
funds from California because the state is not paying for social services for 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 * ARGUMENTS AGAINST 
</P>
<P>
 Most social services are already beyond the legal reach of illegal immigrants. 
If there is fraud in those programs, the state simply should enforce the rules 
that already exist. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be mean-spirited to extend the ban to programs for foster children 
and other needy youths. Indeed, if youngsters taken from abusive parents or 
without any parents at all are booted out of county programs, it is unclear 
just what their fate would be. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballot measure does not stiffen the penalty for falsely obtaining services 
currently unavailable to illegal immigrants. Yet it puts at risk federal 
funding for all AFDC cases, including those of legal residents. POLICE 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT IT DOES 
</P>
<P>
 All law enforcement agencies would be required to fully cooperate with the 
federal Immigration and Naturalization Service after arresting anyone suspected 
of being an illegal alien. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officers would seek to verify the legal status of all people 
arrested by questioning them regarding their date and place of birth and entry 
into the United States. Documentation would be demanded regarding citizenship 
status. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrestees who appear to be in the United States illegally would be informed, 
apart from any criminal justice proceedings, that they must obtain legal status 
or leave the country. Officers would notify the state attorney general and the 
INS of the names of all arrestees suspected of being illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would apparently void all municipal sanctuary ordinances 
protecting refugees and end limited-cooperation agreements the INS has with 
some law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * ARGUMENTS FOR 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officers already seek the identity and legal status of those 
arrested, so this provision would hardly turn California into a police state. 
Besides, the measure only applies to those arrested for other crimes -- people 
cannot be arrested on the suspicion of being an illegal immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting tough on the illegal immigration issue requires action that would 
prevent local communities from granting any shelter to those who are in the 
United States illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Passage of the measure would increase the pressure for federal authorities to 
deport illegal immigrants who have committed crimes -- and who now make up 
about one-sixth of the state's prison population. 
</P>
<P>
 * ARGUMENTS AGAINST 
</P>
<P>
 The aura of suspicion created by Proposition 187 would make it tougher for 
police to do their job. Crime witnesses and victims would be less willing to 
cooperate with law enforcement authorities if they feared they might be 
reported to federal immigration officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement agencies across California are already stretched to their 
limits and will be forced to deal with more paperwork and bureaucracy by having 
to report all suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 300,000 illegal immigrant youngsters expelled from school, the 
job of police will be even tougher. FALSE DOCUMENTS 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT IT DOES: 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 provides a new state penalty of five years in prison or a 
$75,000 fine for manufacturing, distributing or selling false citizenship or 
resident alien documents. It also provides a new state penalty of five years in 
prison or a $25,000 fine for using fake citizenship documents. 
</P>
<P>
 * ARGUMENTS FOR 
</P>
<P>
 Stiffening the penalty for selling or using false documents might make illegal 
immigrants more reluctant to use fake identifications to apply for jobs or for 
government-funded social service and health programs. That, in turn, would free 
up more jobs for American citizens and result in fewer phony public welfare 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
 * ARGUMENTS AGAINST 
</P>
<P>
 The manufacture or use of false immigration or citizenship documents is 
already a federal crime and the state already has statutes against the forgery 
of such documents as driver's licenses. Why impose such severe sanctions 
against individuals who are most often carrying fake papers so that they can 
find work, usually at meager wages?

DECISION '94 / SPECIAL GUIDE TO CALIFORNIA'S ELECTIONS; PROP. 187; IS IT 'SAVE 
OUR STATE' OR 'SINK OUR STATE'? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 WHAT IT IS 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors have labeled Proposition 187 the "save our state" initiative. 
Opponents counter that it is more likely to sink our state. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides do, however, agree on one thing: The sweeping ballot measure 
elicits passions of all types on a scale unheard of since the days of Howard 
Jarvis and Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
 As with the seminal -- and controversial -- tax-cutting measure of the late 
1970s, Proposition 187 could have a burgeoning series of economic and emotional 
impacts that will become fully clear only as time passes. 
</P>
<P>
 If enacted and upheld by the courts, Proposition 187 would bar illegal 
immigrant youngsters from attending public schools, colleges or universities 
and would eliminate any child welfare or foster care benefits for undocumented 
youngsters. Illegal immigrants of all ages would be barred from receiving any 
of the limited publicly funded non-emergency health care programs they now 
qualify for -- including immunizations against deadly disease and prenatal 
care.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Proposition 187 requires state and local police agencies to 
report to federal authorities anyone they arrest who is suspected of being an 
illegal immigrant. And it provides stiff new state sanctions for the 
manufacture or use of false immigration documents, already illegal under 
federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 To accomplish these goals, public health, social service, law enforcement and 
educational administrators would be required to verify the citizenship status 
of their clients, arrestees and pupils. Parents of all children in public 
schools also would have to provide proof of their legal status. 
</P>
<P>
 The administrators would be required to turn in the names of those suspected 
of illegal status to the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service and the 
state attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 With an estimated 1.6 million illegal immigrants in California and a weak 
economy, the pre-election debate has turned less on whether illegal immigration 
is a problem than on whether Proposition 187 is a good solution. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative does not directly address several key issues involving illegal 
immigration -- including how to strengthen border enforcement or how to prevent 
businesses from employing illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 If it passes, various provisions of the measure are likely to be challenged in 
court, particularly the ban on illegal immigrants attending public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure is a statutory amendment. If approved, it may be amended by the 
Legislature but only to further the measure's goals. Such changes would require 
a two-thirds vote in each house of the Legislature or a majority vote by state 
voters. ARGUMENTS FOR 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents say Proposition 187 would send a clear message to federal officials 
that Californians are tired of illegal immigration. It would also make a 
statement that those who break the law should not be rewarded in any way for 
their actions. By cutting off services to those who are in California 
illegally, backers say, the state could reduce costs for social services, 
health care and education by more than $3 billion a year if all portions of the 
measure are upheld by the courts. The savings could be used to increase the 
quality of education and provide additional health care and social services for 
legal residents. Proponents say those who are denied these basic services might 
return to their native lands or be discouraged from entering California in the 
first place. The ban on public school enrollment could lead the U.S. Supreme 
Court to revisit a 1982 decision and, backers say, eventually reverse its 
ruling that declared it unconstitutional to deny a free public education to 
undocumented school-age children. ARGUMENTS AGAINST 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say Proposition 187 is mean-spirited and poorly drafted and will do 
nothing to stop the flow of illegal immigrants across the state's borders. The 
measure, they say, flies in the face of the U.S. Constitution and provides an 
open invitation for a flurry of costly and time-consuming lawsuits. It turns 
educators and doctors into quasi-immigration agents and places at risk about 
$15 billion in federal funding for state and local education, health and 
welfare programs because of conflicts with federal confidentiality 
requirements. The crime rate could increase, opponents say, if hundreds of 
thousands of kindergarten through 12th-grade students are ejected from schools. 
Besides, children should not be penalized for the actions of their parents, 
they say. Disease could spread more quickly because of the inability of illegal 
immigrants to receive any non-emergency health care. Moreover, the requirement 
to turn in suspected illegal immigrants could foster a police state mentality, 
in which citizens and other legal residents would be harassed simply because of 
the color of their skin, their accents or their last names, opponents say. WHO

DECISION '94 / SPECIAL GUIDE TO CALIFORNIA'S ELECTIONS; PROPOSITIONS; 188: 
REGULATES SMOKING STATEWIDE; WHAT IT IS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This initiative statute, devised by cigarette manufacturers and funded almost 
entirely by tobacco firms, would reverse a decade-long trend in California by 
mandating the repeal of all local smoking bans and instituting a single, far 
looser, statewide smoking policy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Relaxed Standard: Proposition 188's standard would permit California 
business owners to allow smoking in sections of virtually all indoor 
workplaces, including restaurants, offices and factories. The Legislature could 
alter the statute by a two-thirds vote. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ventilation: The measure would allow restaurants to set aside 25% of their 
floor space for smoking sections. Owners of restaurants and other businesses 
that opt to permit smoking would be required to meet air ventilation standards 
created by a trade group known as the American Society of Heating, 
Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers. The tobacco industry had 
representatives on the American Society of Heating committee that drafted those 
standards in 1989. At least one tobacco company, Philip Morris, the main backer 
of Proposition 188, has contributed money to the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 * Repeals Local Bans: The initiative would repeal local smoking bans in Los 
Angeles and scores of other cities and counties in the state, and would prevent 
local governments from regulating tobacco use in the future. A recent Los 
Angeles County counsel opinion said passage of the initiative would prohibit 
counties from banning smoking even in museums, libraries, hospitals and other 
local government buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Main Target: The main target of the initiative is a new statewide indoor 
smoking ban passed by the Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Pete Wilson 
earlier this year. Authored by Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood), the 
smoking ban would take effect in January, unless the initiative passes. The 
Friedman bill would prohibit smoking in almost all indoor workplaces, including 
restaurants, shopping malls, offices and factories statewide. Friedman's bill 
would prohibit smoking in bars by 1999, unless the state can develop standards 
ensuring that nonsmokers would not be harmed by secondhand smoke. The Friedman 
bill would permit local governments to pass even stronger smoking restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Minors' Access: Proposition 188 claims it would limit cigarette sales to 
minors by restricting their access to vending machines. Currently, 156 cities 
ban or significantly restrict cigarette vending machines locally. The 
initiative would repeal those ordinances, and cities no longer would be allowed 
to regulate vending machine cigarette sales if Proposition 188 passes. It could 
also repeal a new law specifically aimed at blocking minors' access to 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advertising: The initiative says cigarette billboards cannot be placed 
within 500 feet of schools, although billboards are designed to be read from 
such distances. Proposition 188's restrictions would not apply to street-level 
cigarette ads that commonly are placed in store windows. ARGUMENTS FOR 
</P>
<P>
 Business owners should have the right to determine their own policies on 
smoking. Restaurant owners should be permitted to set up smoking sections to 
accommodate smokers and nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventilation standards contained in the initiative will reduce discomfort to 
nonsmokers from secondhand smoke and allow smokers to light up in public 
places. 
</P>
<P>
 Differing smoking standards in various locales confuse the public and are 
unfair to businesses. By stripping cities and counties of their right to 
regulate smoking, and imposing one standard across the state, California no 
longer would have a patchwork of local smoking ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 Standards in the initiative, though far weaker than what is contained in the 
law due to take effect in January, would be stronger than those in cities and 
counties that have not imposed local smoking prohibitions. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would limit minors' access to tobacco, and limits on the placement 
of billboards would reduce the number of cigarette ads that reach children. 
ARGUMENTS AGAINST 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco industry wrote, funded and organized the campaign for Proposition 
188. If the measure passes, tough anti-smoking laws adopted in various cities 
will be wiped off the books. Cigarette consumption will increase in California 
if smokers are permitted to smoke in what now are smoke-free places. 
</P>
<P>
 Several studies have shown that thousands of people die annually from cancer 
and heart disease because of secondhand smoke. Nonsmokers will suffer ill 
effects from other people's smoke if businesses once again are allowed to 
permit smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the initiative's backers claim that California needs one standard for 
smoking, the state will have one standard in January when the Friedman bill, 
the nation's toughest anti-smoking law, takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The billboard restriction is meaningless because children would still be able 
to read the ads from 500 feet away. They would not, however, be able to read 
the surgeon general's warnings that smoking causes cancer, heart disease and is 
addictive. WHO SUPPORTS IT

 Philip Morris USA, the nation's largest cigarette maker and manufacturer of 
such brands as Marlboro, donated two-thirds of the $7.8 million raised by the 
Yes-on-188 campaign, as of the most recent campaign finance report. Other 
tobacco firms gave almost all of the remainder. Some bar and restaurants owners 
also are backing the measure. WHO OPPOSES IT

DECISION '94 / SPECIAL GUIDE TO CALIFORNIA'S ELECTIONS; PROPOSITIONS; 184: 
THREE STRIKES / TOUGHER SENTENCING; WHAT IT IS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In voter initiative form, this is the "three strikes and you're out" measure, 
which significantly lengthens criminal sentences. It makes no change in state 
law because it is word for word the same as the bill passed by the Legislature 
and signed into law in March by Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The "three strikes" law changed sentencing rules across a wide swath of the 
criminal justice system and is expected to have a huge impact on the prison 
population in years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 If voters approve the initiative, the Legislature can change the statute only 
by mustering a two-thirds vote. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lengthens Sentences: Like the legislation, the initiative statute doubles 
prison terms for all criminals convicted of second felonies, after they have 
been convicted of one prior serious or violent felony. Criminals who commit a 
third felony, and have been convicted of two prior serious or violent felonies, 
receive sentences of three times the prison term now in the law for the crime, 
or 25 years to life, with the possibility of parole, whichever is greater. 
</P>
<P>
 In narrow circumstances, crimes committed by juveniles can count as strikes, 
but the crimes must be violent or serious, the youths must be 16 or 17, and the 
prosecutor must have sought to try them as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 * Violent and Serious Felonies: The California Penal Code specifies "violent" 
felonies as murder, voluntary manslaughter, attempted murder, armed robbery, 
mayhem, rape, including rape by an object, forced sodomy or oral copulation, 
kidnaping of a child under age 14, some child molestation, crimes in which 
firearms are used or great bodily injury is inflicted, and some arson. 
"Serious" felonies include all violent felonies, plus home burglary, any felony 
in which the criminal uses a deadly weapon, grand theft of a firearm, assault 
with intent to commit rape or robbery, assault with a deadly weapon on a police 
officer, assault committed by a prison inmate, assault with a deadly weapon, 
exploding a bomb, and selling heroin, cocaine, PCP or methamphetamine to a 
minor. Burglary accounts for roughly a third of all serious and violent 
felonies that result in prison terms. Criminals who have been previously 
convicted of one or more serious or violent felonies are subject to the law's 
strict sentencing scheme if they commit any felony on subsequent offenses. 
California has more than 500 felonies, among them some types of petty theft, 
passing bad checks for large sums, and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other Provisions: The initiative prohibits judges from granting probation in 
lieu of prison sentences to people who fall under its provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 It limits the right of prosecutors to enter into plea bargains to reduce the 
seriousness of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative requires that convicts serve at least 80% of their prison 
sentences for "second" and "third" strike provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 * First Six Months: In the first six months of the law's operation, 
prosecutors found that more than 70% of the felons prosecuted under "three 
strikes" committed non-serious or nonviolent felonies, but nonetheless face or 
will receive longer sentences because they had records of prior serious or 
violent felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Future: The California Department of Corrections estimates that largely 
because of "three strikes," the California prison population, now at 126,000, 
will exceed 230,000 by the turn of the century. California has 28 prisons, but 
will have to build 25 more by 2000 to house all the inmates. Spending on state 
prisons, now $3 billion annually, is expected to double by 2002. ARGUMENTS FOR 
</P>
<P>
 Although the law already is on the books, Californians should pass the 
initiative to ensure that the Legislature realizes that it would be political 
suicide to weaken the "three strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three strikes" removes criminals from the streets and stops repeat offenders 
from committing more crimes by locking them up. It will reduce crime, and 
Californians will save billions of dollars in lost wages, medical bills and 
property damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The provision doubling sentences for felons who commit a second strike will 
remove criminals from the streets until they reach at least age 40, at which 
point most criminals stop committing crimes. The "third strike" provision will 
ensure the removal from the streets of career criminals for many years, up to 
and including life. 
</P>
<P>
 The provision that requires long sentences for criminals who commit "any 
felony" after having committed prior serious or violent felonies will help law 
enforcement remove criminals from society before they commit more violent 
crimes. ARGUMENTS AGAINST 
</P>
<P>
 "Three strikes" will bankrupt California government by draining billions of 
dollars to build prisons. It will clog courts with defendants accused of 
nonviolent felonies who, facing a quarter-century in prison, will demand jury 
trials rather than accept plea bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 The "three strikes" law is poorly written, unfocused and casts too broad a net 
by stating that people with records of serious or violent crimes can be 
sentenced to decades in prison for relatively minor crimes such as shoplifting 
on their "second" or "third" strikes. As a result, prisons, which now cost more 
than $113,000 per cell to build, will be filled with petty criminals, at a cost 
of about $24,000 per inmate per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone who steals a bike from a garage, a basketball from another garage, and 
shoplifts a beer could be sentenced to 25 years in prison. Prisons will become 
costly geriatric wards to care for aging convicts who would pose no threat. 
</P>
<P>
 The high cost of "three strikes" will force the state to cut funding for 
prevention programs and education. With fewer programs, more youths will turn 
to crime. State government no longer will be able to subsidize the University 
of California and the California State University systems because prisons will 
take all available tax money. WHO SUPPORTS IT 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Reynolds, a Fresno photographer whose daughter was murdered in 1992, 
gathered more than 800,000 signatures on petitions to qualify the measure for 
the ballot, seeking a way to keep repeat criminals in prison. Virtually every 
politician seeking state office supports it. The largest donors are Rep. Mike 
Huffington, $350,000; the California prison guards union, $101,000, and the 
National Rifle Assn., which gave $90,000. WHO OPPOSES IT 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Klaas, father of Polly Klaas; the murder of the 12-year-old in 1993 
fueled Reynolds' signature-gathering effort. Also against the initiative are 
the California Teachers Assn., California Federation of Teachers and the Quaker 
church. Opponents have raised little money.

DECISION '94 / SPECIAL GUIDE TO CALIFORNIA'S ELECTIONS; PROPOSITIONS; 186: 
CREATES A STATEWIDE HEALTH SYSTEM; WHAT IT IS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Proposition 186 would establish the Health Security Act, which would create a 
universal health insurance program aimed at putting all legal residents of 
California into one cradle-to-grave health plan. The intent is to eliminate 
insurance companies and use the dollars that now go into private-sector 
administration and profits to expand medical services to Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eligibility: An amendment to the California Constitution, Proposition 186's 
start-up phase would begin immediately, but benefits and tax increases would 
not take effect until Jan. 1, 1996. At first, all Californians except those 
qualifying for Medicare, Medi-Cal or plans backed by self-insured companies 
would be covered. Eventually the initiative proposes to cover everyone, but 
congressional or federal administrative agency approval would be required for 
people covered under federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Benefits: All inpatient and outpatient hospital or clinical services would 
be covered, as would eye care, home health care, prenatal, perinatal and 
maternity care, and durable medical equipment such as prosthetics, corrective 
lenses and hearing aids. Also covered would be podiatry, chiropractic, 
dialysis, rehabilitative care and prescription drugs. Mental health services 
such as treatment for substance abuse and outpatient counseling would be part 
of the package, as would dental care. Preventive care and long-term care 
benefits would also be included, although expenses for room and board, a 
significant cost in nursing homes, are excluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Each Californian would receive the same health insurance card, providing a 
uniform level of benefits. Physicians who agree to be in the program would be 
prohibited from seeing private patients. 
</P>
<P>
 * Costs: Estimates of the annual cost of the program vary, ranging from $75 
billion to just over $100 billion. Increases in individual and business taxes 
would provide the chief source of funding, but architects of the plan also 
presume the availability of federal and state payments now going into the 
Medicare and Med-Cal programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Taxes: Individuals earning less than $250,000 annually or families earning 
less than $500,000 would pay an additional 2.5% of their taxable income in 
state income tax. Those earning more would pay 5%. Employers would pay an extra 
payroll tax of 4.4% to 8.9% on salaries, depending on the size of their work 
force, phased in over three years. Legal challenges are likely to be mounted by 
self-insured corporations, which finance their own plans, on the issue of 
whether they should have to pay the payroll tax. Cigarette taxes would be 
raised $1 a pack. 
</P>
<P>
 As a trade-off for the higher taxes, individuals would be freed from paying 
health insurance premiums and high deductibles. Insurance policy costs now 
borne by businesses for their employees' health care would be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 * Administration: The program would be administered by a health commissioner 
elected in a statewide vote. The governor would appoint the first health 
commissioner; thereafter, the commissioner would be elected every four years in 
the same election cycle as the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioner would operate under sweeping powers. Among the commissioner's 
duties: negotiating reimbursement rates with physicians and other providers, 
setting annual payment schedules for each of the state's hospitals, deciding 
which drugs would be covered under the plan and, in the event of budget 
difficulties, establishing co-payment rates or rationing medical services 
allowed under the plan. The commissioner also would be empowered to set minimum 
nurse-to-patient staffing ratios in hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Local Controls: The state would be divided into an undetermined number of 
regions, decided on the basis of population and other demographics after a 
formal study. Regional administrators, appointed by the state health 
commissioner, would be in charge of operating the regional health plans and 
performing tasks such as determining eligibility of residents and issuing 
health care cards. The Legislature would establish uniform residency 
requirements for all Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer councils with professional staffs of public advocates would be funded 
in each region to represent the interests of consumers and help mediate 
disputes that develop. ARGUMENTS FOR 
</P>
<P>
 * Savings -- For those now paying for health insurance, Proposition 186 offers 
better coverage, at a lower cost, even when the tax increases are considered. A 
family with a taxable income of $40,000 would have to pay an extra $1,000 a 
year under the 2.5% levy, but would be freed of deductibles and monthly 
premiums. As for businesses, sponsors say that businesses with more than 8.9% 
of payroll now going to pay for health care would save money. 
</P>
<P>
 * Accountability -- An elected health commissioner would be more accountable 
to the citizens of California than insurance companies because voters could 
turn the official out of office every four years. Consumer councils add an 
extra level of protection for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Economy -- Early job losses due to insurance industry cutbacks would be 
inevitable, but businesses would find the 8.9% payroll tax an attractive 
trade-off to the spiraling cost of providing employee health benefits. For 
companies now paying, say, 10% or more of payroll for health care, money would 
be freed up for new investment. Union supporters say Proposition 186 would take 
the issue of health benefits, a sharply contentious issue in labor 
negotiations, off the table and allow them to concentrate on wages and working 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Public agencies -- The Los Angeles Unified School District, which supports 
Proposition 186, would save tens of millions of dollars in health-related 
expenses under the simplified system. Similar benefits are predicted for other 
large government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Medical -- Some physicians predict an improvement in the health profiles of 
both high-end and low-end health care consumers. Numerous studies show that the 
indigent, and those with minimal health insurance, have higher death rates and 
worse rates of recovery from serious illnesses than people in the same age 
groups with more money to spend on health care and insurance. On the other 
hand, studies show that many of the insured get unnecessary tests, and even 
surgeries they don't need simply because they have the ability to pay. 
ARGUMENTS AGAINST 
</P>
<P>
 * Financing -- Sponsors can't deliver their liberal package of benefits with 
the tax increases they are proposing. Two studies have predicted 
multibillion-dollar deficits, requiring either higher tax levies or rationing 
of health care services. 
</P>
<P>
 * Big government -- Setting up the massive system called for by Proposition 
186 would be comparable to the creation of the national health care system in 
Canada or the establishment of the federal Medicare system for Americans 65 and 
over. Such a feat, virtually unprecedented for a state, would require 
cooperation between the governor and Legislature, who have not been able to 
resolve chronic budget deficits in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Magnet -- Since no other states have such a system, California would become 
a magnet for the sick, elderly and uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
 * Politics -- Having an elected health commissioner would further politicize 
health care. Feminist groups risk abortion rights and family planning services 
coming under fire. On the other side of the abortion issue, California's Roman 
Catholic bishops complain that all individuals and employers would be forced by 
Proposition 186 to pay into a health plan that would include abortion as a 
defined health benefit. Employers and individuals now can refuse a plan that 
covers abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hospitals -- Hospitals would be required to operate under so-called "global" 
budgets that would cap payments but do nothing to control inflationary factors 
that are driving up health care costs. State approval would be needed to build 
new hospitals or expand existing ones. Attempts at similar controls in the past 
have failed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Economy -- Major new taxes would halt California's economic recovery. 
Businesses that don't provide health benefits now would meet tax increases by 
eliminating jobs. Arbitrary rates provide disincentives for job creation. The 
tax on companies with fewer than 50 employees is 7% of payroll, but jumps to 
8.9% for firms with 50 or more employees. WHO SUPPORTS IT 
</P>

Insurance Assn. of America, which has contributed $1.5 million to the campaign 
so far, the California Chamber of Commerce, the California Medical Assn., 
Health Net and the California Assn. of Hospitals and Health Systems. Other

DECISION '94 / SPECIAL GUIDE TO CALIFORNIA'S ELECTIONS; PROPOSITIONS; 183: 
LENGTHENS TIMING OF RECALL ELECTIONS; WHAT IT IS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The attempted recall of state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) has prompted 
this proposal. It would change the number of days a governor has to place the 
recall election of a state officeholder on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an obscure provision in the Constitution, the governor now must set an 
election within 60 to 80 days after a sufficient number of signatures have been 
gathered calling for the recall of an officeholder. Proposition 183, a 
constitutional amendment proposal authored by state Sen. Milton Marks (D-San 
Francisco), would allow the governor up to 180 days to order a vote on the 
recall if it can be consolidated with a regularly scheduled election. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, after the gun lobby and others organized a signature-gathering 
effort in retaliation for his legislation banning assault weapons, Roberti 
became the first state officeholder in 80 years to face a recall election. A 
majority of those who voted in the special election in his San Fernando Valley 
district voted to keep Roberti in office. Two months later, the senator lost a 
primary fight for state treasurer. He remains a senator but will leave office 
at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the Roberti vote in April, recall elections aimed at state officeholders 
had been held only three times in California history -- twice in 1913 and once 
in 1914. Recall proposals in which proponents failed to gather enough 
signatures to reach the ballot have been attempted 107 times, 55 of those since 
1986. In 1911, voters won the authority to recall an elected state official 
during a wave of reform spearheaded by Gov. Hiram Johnson that also gave them 
the power of initiative and referendum. ARGUMENTS FOR 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the June primary was only two months away, Los Angeles County 
spent $1 million arranging for the separate Roberti recall election. If 
Proposition 183 had been in effect, the recall would have gone on the ballot 
along with other contests at a regular election time, sparing the extra 
expense. Consolidation of recall elections with forthcoming election dates 
would save time, effort and money. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting in a recall election would be more representative of the electorate's 
wishes if held in conjunction with regularly scheduled elections where voter 
turnout is likely to be higher. ARGUMENTS AGAINST 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 183 is designed by legislators to protect themselves by delaying 
the recall process for up to six months, and it would deny voters the right to 
promptly remove an officeholder they dislike. The idea behind the recall power 
was to give voters the right to make an immediate change in the direction of 
government by removing and replacing unsatisfactory officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 183 could also result in a state official being recalled from 
office and reelected on the same ballot, a ridiculous situation. WHO SUPPORTS

DECISION '94 / SPECIAL GUIDE TO CALIFORNIA'S ELECTIONS; PROPOSITIONS; 185: GAS 
TAX INCREASE; WHAT IT IS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Proposition 185, a proposed statute initiative authored by the Planning and 
Conservation League environmental group, would impose a 4% sales tax on 
gasoline to finance mass transit and other transportation projects. The tax 
would go into effect Jan. 1. Though similar to some of the aims of Proposition 
181, Proposition 185 is not part of the larger rail scheme envisioned for the 
state in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 * Taxes: Consumers now pay a sales tax on gasoline that varies by county from 
7.25% to 8.5%. By adding the new tax, Proposition 185 would increase those 
taxes to totals ranging from 11.25% to 12.5% of the purchase price. The sales 
taxes are levied on top of an 18-cents-per-gallon state gasoline tax and an 
18.4-cents-per-gallon federal gasoline tax. 
</P>
<P>
 * Spending: Proposition 185 provides specific guidelines for the allocation of 
funds raised by the increased sales tax. Of the new revenue, 47.5% would be 
devoted to transit capital projects such as buying passenger coaches, 25.5% to 
transit system operations, 15% to earthquake safety and retrofitting, and 2% 
each to bicycle and pedestrian facilities, electric and clean fuel vehicle 
research and development, traffic signal synchronization, environmental 
mitigation, and highway and railroad grade separation projects. Fog-related 
safety projects and ride-sharing programs would each get 1% of the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for earthquake safety projects would expire in 2000 and for clean fuel 
vehicle research in 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure further specifies how transit capital improvement funds are to be 
spent by setting priorities and earmarking certain amounts for particular 
projects. For example, it gives first priority to the financing of a high-speed 
(150 m.p.h.) coastal rail line between Los Angeles and San Francisco by 
allowing up to 10% of the capital improvement funds to be spent on the 
construction of the route. Other priority projects include improvements to the 
Alameda corridor rail line that connects the Los Angeles and Long Beach harbors 
with Downtown Los Angeles; improvements to intercity and commuter rail in 
Riverside and San Bernardino counties, and improvements to the Los Angeles-San 
Diego rail corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 185 also provides up to $5 million for a Yosemite shuttle service 
and a Lake Tahoe/Truckee transit system. 
</P>
<P>
 * Revenue: Proposition 185 would generate about $630 million a year for 
transportation projects. The increased cost is expected to cause some reduction 
in gasoline usage by motorists, decreasing total gasoline and sales tax revenue 
by about $15 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Administration: The measure requires the establishment of a three-member 
committee of the California Transportation Commission to distribute all state 
funds for rail projects. It specifies that no more than 20% of the money it 
raises can be used for administrative overhead. ARGUMENTS FOR 
</P>
<P>
 With the new monies available, Proposition 185 would make it easier for more 
people, particularly senior citizens and those with disabilities, to use mass 
transit. The result would be fewer cars on the road and therefore less 
congestion, reduced air pollution and energy savings. The money Proposition 185 
would pump into new construction would create jobs and help spur California's 
economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil companies pouring hundreds of thousands of dollars into the attempt to 
defeat the proposal have a single aim: to keep people in their cars so they 
will continue to buy gasoline. ARGUMENTS AGAINST 
</P>
<P>
 Californians are overtaxed and Proposition 185 would only make that worse by 
increasing the cost of an essential commodity, gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 185 ignores California's real transportation needs, and instead 
would pour money into the pet projects of the Planning and Conservation League 
and its contributors. Southern Pacific Railroad, which owns the right of way to 
the coastal route for the high-speed rail line, has donated heavily to the 
league's campaign and would benefit financially from Proposition 185's passage.

DECISION '94 / SPECIAL GUIDE TO CALIFORNIA'S ELECTIONS; PROPOSITIONS; 181: 
BONDS FOR RAIL AND AIR PROJECTS; WHAT IT IS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An outgrowth of the movement to reduce pollution and congestion by enticing 
more motorists to take mass transit, this proposal would authorize the sale of 
$1 billion in bonds to finance expanded rail services for California. It does 
not stipulate specific projects to be financed and in fact would permit the 
state broad discretion to determine how to spend the funds generated by the 
sale of the bonds, as long as the state uses the funds to expand and improve 
the state's passenger rail network, including intercity, commuter and urban 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure requires at least 15% or $150 million of the funds to be spent on 
intercity rail services such as Amtrak's San Diegan, which runs between Santa 
Barbara/San Luis Obispo, Los Angeles and San Diego. Apart from that 
stipulation, the bond money could be used for purposes ranging from the 
acquisition of rights of way to the purchase of rolling stock, but could not be 
used to pay for day-to-day operations of transit systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The general obligation bond issue would be backed by the state, meaning that 
general fund revenues would be used to pay the principal and interest on the 
bond loan. Assuming the bonds are sold at a 6% interest rate, it would cost 
about $1.6 billion to pay them off over their 20-year life. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 181 is the third and last in a recent package of transportation 
bond issues totaling $3 billion to be presented to the voters for approval. The 
bond issues were part of a 10-year, multibillion-dollar plan conceived in 1989 
to relieve congestion and upgrade California's transportation system. Part of 
the plan approved by voters included a 9-cents-per-gallon gasoline tax. The 
first bond issue passed in 1990, but the second issue fell victim in 1992 to 
the growing distaste among voters for incurring more debt. 
</P>
<P>
 If Proposition 181 does not pass, state officials will be required by a 
proposition previously approved by voters to make up for its loss with 
transportation dollars intended for highways. Its failure probably would cause 
the delay or cancellation of some road projects scheduled in the years ahead. 
ARGUMENTS FOR 
</P>
<P>
 By providing the financing for projects designed to make California's rail 
service more efficient and reliable, Proposition 181 would help lure increasing 
numbers of motorists out of their automobiles and into mass transit. And fewer 
cars on the road mean less traffic congestion and better air quality. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, a massive rail construction program could create thousands 
of jobs and help stimulate the economy. An expanded and improved rail network 
is essential for economic growth, which is dependent on California having a 
fast and efficient transportation system. Failure to improve the transportation 
system would threaten California's economic vitality. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere was the value of a reliable, efficient rail system better demonstrated 
than in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and the 1994 Northridge earthquake. 
After the collapse of vital highway bridges, it was the rail systems that 
helped keep the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas moving. ARGUMENTS AGAINST 
</P>
<P>
 In this era of dwindling tax revenues, California can ill afford this spend 
now, pay later approach. At a time when California state government is awash in 
red ink, the voters should not be asked to approve another bond issue that 
increases the debt burden. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the millions of dollars that have been invested in mass transit, 
only a relatively small portion of the population travels by rail. Most rail 
services cannot operate from fare box revenues alone; government invariably 
must bail them out. WHO SUPPORTS IT

DECISION '94 / SPECIAL GUIDE TO CALIFORNIA'S ELECTIONS; PROPOSITIONS; 191: 
RENAMES JUSTICE COURTS; WHAT IT IS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Proposition 191 would convert the state's 47 Justice Courts, which operate in 
the smaller towns of rural counties, to Municipal Courts. All Justice Court 
judges would become Municipal Court judges. Both the Justice and Municipal 
Courts hear criminal cases involving less serious misdemeanors and civil cases 
involving disputes of $25,000 or less. The only difference is that Justice 
Courts serve districts of 40,000 people or less; Municipal Court districts have 
more than 40,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 A name change, from Justice Court to Municipal Court, would have no impact on 
the work Justice Court judges are doing -- since, under Proposition 91, Justice 
Court judges and Municipal Court judges already are doing the same work -- and 
the salary is the same: $95,214 annually. ARGUMENTS FOR 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 191 would finish a job that California voters began in the 1988 
elections, that of "professionalizing and equalizing the administration of 
justice" in the state's rural outposts such as Alpine, Inyo, Lassen, Mono and 
Tuolumne counties. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, voters approved Proposition 91, which increased the authority and 
prestige of Justice Court judges. It required that Justice Court judges have a 
minimum of five years experience as a lawyer -- the same as Municipal Court 
judges -- and barred the practice of law on the side. It also authorized 
Justice Court judges to travel throughout the state to hear cases in counties 
whose courts were short-staffed. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Proposition) 191 is long overdue," said Mariposa County Justice Court Judge 
Carlos C. LaRoche. The Justice Court label, he said, is "an anachronism" left 
over from California's frontier days. ARGUMENTS AGAINST 
</P>
<P>
 The only formal opposition to Proposition 191 has come from Gary B. Wesley, a 
San Jose attorney who often submits contrary ballot arguments when no one else 
will. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Justice Courts are to be eliminated, Wesley said, those judges ought to 
have to apply for the Municipal Court. "Perhaps," he said in the ballot 
pamphlet, "they will not be needed or sufficiently qualified." WHO SUPPORTS IT

DECISION '94 / SPECIAL GUIDE TO CALIFORNIA'S ELECTIONS; PROPOSITIONS; 189: NO 
BAIL OPTION FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT; WHAT IT IS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All Proposition 189 would do is amend the California Constitution to make it 
clear that judges have the power to do what they already are authorized to do 
-- jail accused rapists and molesters without bail in the weeks and months 
before a trial. With legislators eager to appear tough on crime, the vote to 
put the measure on the ballot passed the Assembly, 69 to 0.It sailed through 
the Senate, 30 to 0. ARGUMENTS FOR 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 189 is about protecting innocent, law-abiding citizens from the 
lowest and most vicious variety of criminals that prowl our streets -- sexual 
predators. When the public talks about being concerned about violent crime, 
this is the kind of law they would like to see passed. Assemblywoman Dede 
Alpert (D-Coronado), a co-author of the measure, concedes that judges already 
have the power to lock up dangerous sexual offenders. But, she said, "We need 
to make it clearer to judges how significant these particular crimes are." 
ARGUMENTS AGAINST 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 189 "sounds good on paper," said Ted Brown, chairman of the 
Libertarian Party of Los Angeles County. "We don't want rapists walking the 
streets. But what (backers) say it says and what it says are two different 
things." The measure, he said, casts too wide a net: "This would affect people 
who potentially are not violent offenders, like someone accused of date rape 
who has no prior criminal record." Since the law already enables judges to deny 
bail to violent felons, the measure "looks like election year pandering." WHO 
SUPPORTS IT

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN HOFFENBLUM and DARRY SGRAGOW, Hoffenblum, a Republican, has owned and 
run his Los Angeles political consulting firm since 1979, working for a variety 
of federal, state and local candidates. A former Air Force intelligence officer 
who served in Vietnam, Hoffenblum worked to reelect President Richard Nixon in 
1972. He is a graduate of USC.; Sragow has been working for Democratic 
candidates since 1972. A former Navy lieutenant, Sragow ran Sen. Alan 
Cranston's reelection campaign in 1986, worked for Dianne Feinstein's 
gubernatorial campaign in 1990 and most recently managed John Garamendi's bid 
for governor this year. Sragow is an attorney and graduate of Cornell and 
Georgetown universities.

 "Any charge that pops up late (in a campaign) and is particularly personal or 
outrageous is indeed suspect." -- Sagrow 
</P>
<P>
 "More often than not, the opinion as to whether something is true or false . . 
. is based on which candidate is being gored." -- Hoffenblum 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Hoffenblum and Darry Sragow are longtime California political 
consultants. That means they know by trade all the tricks of political 
persuasion at election time. The Times asked Hoffenblum, who works for 
Republicans, and Sragow, who works for Democrats, to warn us about what voters 
should watch for as the election approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 HOFFENBLUM: OK, Darry, it's 10 days before the election and the candidates' 
campaign managers and media advisers are looking at polling data indicating 
they are behind. It is desperation time. Can voters expect to see a barrage of 
last-minute deceptive advertising? 
</P>
<P>
 SRAGOW: I don't know about you, Allan, but none of my candidates would engage 
in those tactics. But I do warn them to expect it from the Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 HOFFENBLUM: Come on, one's party affiliation doesn't determine one's ethics. 
And more often than not, the opinion as to whether something is true or false, 
right or wrong, is based on which candidate is being gored . . . yours or your 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 SRAGOW: The most common trick is to take one teeny piece of information about 
an opponent and totally distort it. 
</P>
<P>
 HOFFENBLUM: You mean the half-truth. 
</P>
<P>
 SRAGOW: I'm not even getting to the "half" truth yet. One typical Republican 
ploy is to create a new organization that issues ratings of officeholders. The 
statement that the "National Taxpayers Alliance" says my Democratic candidate 
has an 8 rating out of 100 in cutting spending may well raise questions in the 
minds of the voters, yet the National Taxpayers Alliance may be the creation of 
a Republican political consultant who computes ratings that are totally 
misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 HOFFENBLUM: OK. But I've seen campaigns where the Democrat consultant just 
turns around and creates his or her own phony group to do the same thing. The 
biggest problem we Republicans have is that several organizations that purport 
to be nonpartisan are actually run by partisan Democrats who tout the liberal 
agenda and are able and willing to send out mailers that often totally distort 
the record of the Republican incumbent or candidate. Environmentalists and 
education groups are the worst offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 SRAGOW: So what you're saying is that groups that endorse Democrats have a 
bias. I'm saying that a lot of Republican endorsement groups don't even exist. 
</P>
<P>
 HOFFENBLUM: Just because the message comes from a real group, or even a 
well-known person, doesn't mean the facts are truthful, especially when it 
arrives at the last minute. Let me give you an example. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years back, I was managing a tough campaign for the state Assembly, and 
just days before the election, a vote-gram arrived in the mailboxes of voters 
over the age of 60, attacking my candidate. Now this is an important group. The 
vote-gram was supposedly signed by Claude Pepper, who was a highly influential 
member of Congress noted for supporting issues important to seniors. One week 
after the election, we discovered that Mr. Pepper knew nothing about the 
mailer. We lost that election. 
</P>
<P>
 SRAGOW: Earlier this year, I was the consultant to a strongly pro-environment 
legislative candidate who was challenging a longtime incumbent with a record on 
the environment that was worse than Exxon's. My candidate was a member of the 
Sierra Club, and was strongly endorsed by the club. In the closing days of the 
race, the incumbent dropped a piece of mail implying that he was endorsed by 
the Sierra Club. That false statement clearly hurt the challenger in strongly 
pro-environment coastal precincts. 
</P>
<P>
 HOFFENBLUM: I can top that. I remember being involved in a tough Republican 
primary, and again, in the closing days of the election, my candidate's 
opponent sent out a mailer which loudly proclaimed on the face of the envelope 
"Reagan Endorsement Enclosed." If the voter bothered to open the envelope to 
read the message, they would have found out that it was the local candidate who 
had endorsed Ronald Reagan, not the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
 SRAGOW: An incumbent's votes on specific bills are fertile ground for 
deception. Particularly in Congress, votes are cast on very complex bills. 
Take, for example, aid to Israel. An up-or-down vote on aid to Israel is highly 
unusual. Those funds are one line in huge, multibillion-dollar, multipurpose 
bills. A member of Congress who votes against the entire bill could be accused 
of voting against Israel, even though aid to Israel is a very small piece of 
the bill, and the member's reason may having nothing to do with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Or there might be several votes on a particular topic. For example, there were 
two versions of legislation to investigate the current post office scandal in 
Congress. A candidate who voted "yes" on one of them and "no" on the other for 
entirely legitimate policy reasons could be falsely accused in a last-minute 
mailer of voting to stop the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 HOFFENBLUM: But again, that's done by both sides. We are really saying that 
voters should be highly skeptical of any charges made against a candidate -- 
regardless of the purported source -- in the closing days of the campaign. If 
the facts are true, a candidate wants to get on top of the highest mountain 
with the loudest bullhorn and repeat the charges as early and as often as 
possible. Charges made at the last moment are in almost all cases suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 SRAGOW: I agree with that. It's tough to get a message across to voters in 
this gigantic state. If I have the goods on an opponent, I will certainly make 
the charge early and repeat it often. Any charge that pops up late and is 
particularly personal or outrageous is indeed suspect, all the more so if it 
comes from a source other than the opposition campaign. Anonymous flyers are 
illegal and I think most voters know that if a charge is made anonymously -- or 
if it's not clear who sent it -- the allegation should be discounted. 
</P>
<P>
 HOFFENBLUM: The more obscure the source, the more suspicious the voter should 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 SRAGOW: One of the great mysteries of California politics are the so-called 
"slate cards," or voter guides. They invariably flood our mailboxes in the 
closing days of the campaigns (and, to the chagrin of some candidates, after 
the election). I've never figured out which slate card to trust. Each looks 
official or purports to come from a political party. The truth is that most of 
these cards are profit-making enterprises that sell space to the highest 
bidder. My advice is to ignore all of them. 
</P>
<P>
 HOFFENBLUM: As one who produces one of the more established slate cards for 
Republican voters, I have to take exception to that. Voters should approach 
slate cards and voters guides like any other piece of campaign literature. Some 
are phony and deceptive, others are not. The voters should look very closely to 
see who sent the slate card. If they can't tell, then throw it away. 
</P>
<P>
 SRAGOW: But I'd like to get beyond practices that are literally deceptive and 
talk about practices that may be truthful, but are misleading. You Republicans 
are especially adept at manipulating emotional symbols. When you've run out of 
anything else to talk about, you fall back on fear. Willie Horton, black and 
white news footage of people scurrying across the I-5, film of a terrorist 
throwing a body of an executed hostage onto the Tarmac. These powerful visual 
symbols are dredged up whenever you have an unpopular candidate or a lousy 
economy and your party can't win on its own merits. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the debate in a campaign is not about particular issues, it is about 
which issue the voter ought to have uppermost in his or her mind when they cast 
their ballot. If crime is the top issue, Republicans will do better. If 
education is the top issue, Democrats will do better. That is because of 
voters' preconceptions of the strengths and weaknesses of the two political 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
 So I would urge undecided voters to avoid being drawn in by the emotion-laden 
symbols they will see in Republican ads during the remaining days of the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 HOFFENBLUM: Give me a break. That is nothing more than partisan, elitist 
drivel. When a conservative attempts to have a rational debate on governmental 
policies pertaining to education or senior citizens or welfare reform, what do 
we hear from your candidates? Not debate, but baseless charges that we are 
anti-education, anti-seniors and insensitive to the problems of the 
disadvantaged. 
</P>
<P>
 SRAGOW: You said it. I didn't. In any case, I don't think we have found scare 
symbols to match Willie Horton. We just appeal to the voters' better instincts. 
</P>
<P>
 HOFFENBLUM: I can go tit for tat with you, if you want, on truthful political 
advertising that has an emotional impact. Democrats use the same techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 SRAGOW: Let me tell you what I think the key problem is. In a state this big, 
voters have no hope of talking directly with the candidates. They have to rely 
on bits and pieces of information that appear fleetingly on TV or radio or in 
their mailbox. Most of those pieces of information are paid for by the 
candidates. You and I are confirming that those advertisements are often 
suspect. So the question is, what information can a voter trust? 
</P>
<P>
 In the long term, I'm convinced that we need to force the broadcast industry, 
which, after all, uses the public airways to make a profit, to provide us with 
more direct access to candidates. But in the next 10 days, I can only confirm 
that the basic rule is "voter beware." 
</P>
<P>
 HOFFENBLUM: Amen.

 SLATE MAILERS 
</P>
<P>
 The week before the Nov. 8 election, millions of so-called slate mailers will 
be sent to voters throughout California.The mailers, often purporting to be 
"official guides" to voting, sometimes are compiled by legitimate organizations 
nd reflect their endorsements. But many of these mailes are organized as 
profit-making ventures by political consultants and the slots are sold to 
candidates. LAST-MINUTE MAILERS 
</P>
<P>
 The hardest campaign charges to answer are those sent by mail in the last few 
days of the campaign when it's either too late or too expensive to respond. 
Voters should be especially wary of any last-minute charges, analysts say, 
becauseif they had merit they would have been raised before.

 Now, caught in a legal fight with his former attorney who is seeking payment 
for a $9,600 legal bill, Prince is claiming he didn't make the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue came up last week in an Orange County courtroom, where Prince's 
former attorney, William Baker of Santa Ana, challenged Prince's assertion that 
he has no assets. Baker argued that if Prince could lend $20,000 to the 
Proposition 187 campaign, then he should be able to pay his outstanding legal 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 But Prince told the judge that the cashier's check for the loan came from his 
father, Downey businessman Leland Prince, and that the campaign treasurer had 
incorrectly listed him as the lender. The judge ordered Prince to produce a 
copy of the cashier's check. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign treasurer Betty Presley said she was unaware of the error until 
Prince made his admission in court. The day after the hearing, Presley filed a 
campaign finance amendment listing Leland Prince as the lender, but she said 
she's also waiting for Ron Prince's copy of the check. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Fair Political Practices Commission says the law requires that 
both the lender and the intermediary, in this case Ron Prince, must be listed 
on the campaign reports and that "failure to do so could amount to the campaign 
laundering money."

 High Cost of Votes: A recent memo from Democratic Assembly kingpin Willie 
Brown laid out the cost of registering new voters in tightly contested races. 
Among the most expensive was Orange County's 69th Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's memo said Democrats spent more than $85,000 to sign up 9,582 new 
voters, which translates to $9.12 a voter. The only district in the state where 
voter registration cost more per person was San Diego's 80th Assembly District 
at $9.29. Statewide, the average was $5.95 a voter. The Democrats' effort in 
the 69th should pay dividends for standard-bearer Mike Metzler, who is in a 
tough battle with Republican Jim Morrissey. The seat is the only state or 
federal office the Democrats have held in Orange County in recent memory, and 
the departure of Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) to run for attorney 
general has left the party in a testy position. 
</P>
<P>
 As pricey as the registration effort was, it did increase the Democrats' voter 
advantage by 4.5%, the biggest percentage jump anywhere in the state. Democrats 
now hold a 56.1% to 34.3% edge over Republicans.

 To Endorse or Not Endorse: After 14 years on the Capistrano Unified School 
District Board of Trustees, Annette B. Gude has made a lot of friends. Steeling 
herself for the upcoming election battle against challenger Dorsey Brause, a 
conservative Christian who heads the South County chapter of the California 
Republican Assembly, Gude collected a string of endorsements from state 
lawmakers she has worked with. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week, Gil Ferguson took back his vote of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson has known Gude for a decade and gave her his stamp of approval early 
in the campaign. But the Newport Beach assemblyman--who plans to run next year 
for the state Senate--unendorsed her after Gude issued a recent press release 
warning that the "religious right" was trying to take over the Capistrano 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't feel I should be endorsing someone who is going to rail against 
somebody because of their religion," said Ferguson, whose office was flooded 
with complaints from Brause supporters after word of the Gude press release 
spread. "A person I was endorsing was doing something I thought was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Outraged, Gude responded with another fiery press release, saying she was 
"disappointed" in Ferguson and repeating her concerns about the religious 
right's intent "to take over (Capistrano Unified) and indeed every school board 
in the nation."
