JACK SMITH: FROM SMALL LOSSES COME FOND MEMORIES AND SHARED PAIN

 When the earthquake struck, my wife and I, of course, were in bed. I lay there 
while the house shook, and shook, and shook. I heard the tinkling of broken 
glass. I was strangely calm. I felt no increase in heart rate. It was just 
another earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you feel that?" I asked my wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you kidding?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She got up, found the power was off and lit a candle. "You shouldn't light 
candles," I told her. "You might start a fire." She put the candle out and 
hunted in the dark for a flashlight. 
</P>
<P>
 I have read dozens of lists on what to do and what not to do in an earthquake, 
but I have never prepared. Our daughter-in-law gave us an earthquake kit a few 
years ago, but all I did was drink the bottle of brandy it contained. I don't 
know how to turn off the water. I don't know how to turn off the gas. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife heard a hissing and went outdoors to find the water heater had a 
leaking line. I felt quite incompetent. I lay there waiting for the 
aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 I have been through so many earthquakes, they no longer scare me. I was a 
school kid when my first one hit. I think it was in 1926. I was hanging by my 
knees from a horizontal bar in the schoolyard. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Long Beach earthquake struck, in March, 1933, I had just come home 
from Long Beach Poly High School and was standing in front of the fireplace in 
the apartment where I lived with my mother and older sister.  
</P>
<P>
 My mother was sitting in a rocking chair nearby. When the place began to crack 
and rumble, I said: "Jesus Christ!" My mother said, "Why, Jack, I didn't know 
you used that kind of language." 
</P>
<P>
 She was more shocked by my profanity than she was by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown Long Beach was devastated. That was the end of the school year for 
me. The dome over Poly High had crumbled into the foyer. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Tehachapi earthquake came in 1952, I was a reporter at the 
Herald-Express. Howard Hughes lent us one of his airplanes to fly a crew to 
Tehachapi, and I was sent. As we landed at the little airport, a huge dark 
shadow enveloped us. I realized that we had just missed a plane taking off. 
That was the closest I ever came to getting killed in an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Whittier quake came in the fall of 1987, my wife and I were traveling 
in Spain. We had just come to an old hotel after a day's journey to find that 
we had a telegram from our older son. It said, "DON'T WORRY. YOUR HOUSE IS OK." 
He didn't say why it might not have been. 
</P>
<P>
 These odd experiences, I suspect, have made me rather blase about earthquakes. 
They're a hazard one lives with in California, the way our ancestors used to 
live with wild beasts. They go with the territory. 
</P>
<P>
 But no earthquake leaves us untouched. Even though we did not suffer any 
devastating losses, as so many others did last Monday, we did not escape 
entirely. Our losses were trivial, but there was a poignancy about them. It 
suggested how profound must have been the despair of those who lost their homes 
and all their possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Our floors were scattered with fallen objects -- glass, pictures, books, 
almost my entire pharmacopoeia and a few treasures I had forgotten I owned 
until they lay shattered at my feet. 
</P>
<P>
 One was a rose-colored fluted crystal vase (my wife called it cranberry glass) 
that had been given to me by Claire Windsor, the beautiful silent screen star. 
I have forgotten the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your Champlin mug is broken," my wife said from the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 She held it up. It was a ceramic coffee mug. The handle was broken off. It had 
a red Harvard shield on one side with the word veritas inscribed on it. On the 
other side, it said: "In Celebration of Charles Champlin, 47. September 24, 
1983." 
</P>
<P>
 I have at least a dozen coffee mugs, most of them in celebration of some 
occasion or another, but for some reason unknown to me, I had almost always 
drunk my coffee from the Champlin mug. One develops habits for which there are 
no logical reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous other souvenirs of this or that occasion lay amid the debris on the 
floor. It was a matter of sweeping up. No great loss. We did not sleep that 
night in the park. We shed no tears. It was just another earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But earthquakes take their toll. No matter how trivial one's loss, one somehow 
feels mistreated by the gods. I will probably never think of Claire Windsor 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Chuck Champlin will send me another mug.

BOOK REVIEW: FICTION; SOME SATIRE, A BIT OF MYSTERY, A DASH OF PHILOSOPHY; 
DANCE, DANCE, DANCE BY HARUKI MURAKAMI , T RANSLATED FROM THE JAPANESE BY 
ALFRED BIRNBAUM ; KODANSHA, $22, 393 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This Japanese novel is like a boxcar rumbling all alone down the tracks. It's 
a big, bright boxcar, loaded with good stuff -- mystery, mysticism, sex and 
rock 'n' roll -- but we can't see the engine that has to be pulling it, or the 
caboose that has to be trailing behind. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, "Dance, Dance, Dance" is a sequel to Haruki Murakami's 1982 novel 
"Wild Sheep Chase." The rather slow beginning of the new story recapitulates 
the ending of the earlier one. A major character in "Wild Sheep Chase" -- the 
Sheep Man -- lives on as a kind of ghost in a shadowy, atavistic world that 
lies beneath the "advanced capitalism" of modern Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Dance, Dance, Dance," the nameless narrator of both books has become a 
34-year-old free-lance writer who "shovels cultural snow" diligently but 
without passion. Divorced, recovering from a nervous breakdown, unable to 
connect emotionally with other people, he is drawn back to Japan's northernmost 
island, Hokkaido, by dreams in which a woman -- perhaps Kiki, the call girl who 
left him in the seedy Dolphin Hotel, where the Sheep Man used to live -- is 
crying for him. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel is gone, replaced by a posh new Dolphin, but a magical pocket of the 
Sheep Man's world still exists. The narrator steps out of an elevator into 
darkness; a hallway leads him to a candle-lit room where a musty figure in 
sheepskins tells him: "You gotta dance. As long as the music plays. . . . Your 
feet stop, you get stuck. . . . Dance so everyone's impressed." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheep Man, it seems, is now the narrator's guardian angel, a cosmic 
switchboard who can "connect you to what you want." But the fact that the 
narrator can see the Sheep Man is a sign of how much he has already lost, of 
his exhaustion, his closeness to spiritual death. 
</P>
<P>
 A young woman who works for the hotel stumbles into the same darkness and 
hears the shuffle of the Sheep Man's slippers. A psychic 13-year-old girl whose 
mother, a brilliant but self-absorbed photographer, has mislaid her at the 
hotel sees the image of the Sheep Man in the narrator's mind. These two are his 
first connections. 
</P>
<P>
 Others follow. Back in Tokyo, the narrator runs into a junior high school 
classmate, Gotanda, now a B-movie star. Gotanda introduces him to another call 
girl, Mei, who knew Kiki. Then Mei is murdered, with the narrator's business 
card in her wallet as the only clue. The hack-novelist father of the 
13-year-old, Yuki, hires the narrator as her companion and, as a hedge against 
statutory rape, buys him a third call girl, who disappears just like the first 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Yuki's jet-set mother, she has a boyfriend, a one-armed American poet 
-- and when the narrator, on another visit to the shadow world, finds six 
skeletons sitting on couches in a vacant Honolulu office building, one skeleton 
has an arm missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Dizzy? Yet this is an extremely accessible novel for American readers, thanks 
to Murakami's colloquial, wisecracking style, ably translated by Alfred 
Birnbaum. Murakami's narrator may be a misfit, but he is a keen observer of the 
slick, corrupt, image-conscious, expense-account society of the '80s. The 
realistic parts of the novel are fast-moving and funny -- no small achievement, 
considering that the narrator often does little more than eat, drink, brood and 
listen to his favorite oldies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dance, Dance, Dance" successfully mixes genres -- the philosophical quest, 
the topical satire, the whodunit. Murakami's characters, from kids to cops, are 
vividly drawn, no matter how unlikely the situations they encounter. The 
narrative voice -- increasingly sure of itself as the speaker's mental health 
improves and he begins to take ethical stands and become capable of love -- 
pulls like a diesel. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through, we have no idea what's going to happen next, yet we have 
confidence that a storyteller as good as Murakami will answer all our 
questions. In fact -- surprise! -- he doesn't. Loose ends dangle from the novel 
like a boxcar's rear coupling -- a sign that it may be linked to yet another 
Sheep Man story, the conclusion of a trilogy, a caboose so far 
clickety-clacking only in the author's mind.

COUNTERPUNCH: COUNTRY IS GONE BUT SONGS STAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STONEY RICHARDS, Stoney Richards has been in broadcasting for 24 years. He 
is now morning host on WQKB-FM (K-BEAR) in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Radio stations come and go. And with a market the size of Los Angeles with 
some 80 competing signals, the comings and goings may be a little hard to keep 
track of. The silencing of country music on KLAC-AM (570) after 24 years was 
duly noted ("The Last Word in Lonesome Is Country," Calendar, Dec. 2). But what 
is so often difficult to convey when an audience loses "its music" is the 
emotional attachment that also went with this pictureless media. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than two decades, KLAC was known throughout Southern California and 
recognized for professional excellence from Nashville to Austin to Bakersfield. 
It was always important for country artists to have their songs played by KLAC. 
Kenny Rogers credits the start of his successful career in country music with 
KLAC's decision to play "Lucille." 
</P>
<P>
 Through the years, some of the greats of broadcasting have stood by the KLAC 
microphones: Jay (Bird) Lawrence, Dick Haines (At the Reins), Bob Kingsley, 
Danny Dark and, of course, Jim Healy. More recently there's been a bit more of 
an itinerant talent list from Jerry House, Scott Carpenter, Gene Price, Don 
Hinson and for a brief moment, even Gary Owens.  
</P>
<P>
 I had the opportunity to ride the crest of this wave out for the past 10 
years. In that time, we all witnessed the change from Country and Western to 
New Country and Hot Country. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a quarter million of us crowded into Hansen Dam for an event called 
Countryfest, where we experienced what was the beginning of the Randy Travis 
star shoot across the music industry. George Strait, Reba McEntire, Ricky 
Skaggs and the Oak Ridge Boys were all KLAC staples. 
</P>
<P>
 But the audience wasn't just discovering this form of music as the latest 
trend to fill the void where pop music lost its soul. Our people belonged to 
Porter Wagoner and Hank Thompson. Marty Robbins was just as famous as Lefty 
Frizzell and our request lines rang for Hank Jr. as much as they did for Hank 
Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Garth Brooks happened, Merle Haggard and Waylon Jennings were 
having trouble selling records. Still, country music is a hot seller here and 
the most-listened-to format of all nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But broadcasters in L.A. share an agenda that doesn't include much music on AM 
radio, and especially not much country music in a market with the demographics 
of Los Angeles. Regardless of the fact that you may have listened, the experts 
say you didn't and so KLAC Country, after 24 years, is no more. The station is 
now playing "adult standards." 
</P>
<P>
 And all we of KLAC Country have left are the feelings of the fun and games and 
gossip we shared and the words of all those great country songs. And no one can 
ever take that away from us. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks for the memories.

COUNTERPUNCH: CULTURAL AFFAIRS NEEDS ARTS VISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SERENA TRIPI, Serena Tripi is president, Board of Directors, the Dance 
Resource Center and an independent performing arts producer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I work with a dance organization that offers, among other things, technical 
assistance to more than 300 dance companies and individual artists. The last 
three years have given me a lot of contact with Cultural Affairs Department 
manager Al Nodal and his staff. There were five of us, representatives of 
various organizations, who gathered in his office every month to assist in the 
planning and execution of the running of a smooth grants process. 
</P>
<P>
 I am well aware that the department has had its cutbacks and that it has 
employees who work above and beyond the call of duty. There is a lot of respect 
that I give to the Cultural Affairs Department and the job that it has in 
trying to spread the ever-thinning arts dollar and there is also a lot of 
trepidation that goes along with that. The trepidation comes from Nodal's 
statements about restructuring the department, as reported by Diane Haithman 
("Cultural Affairs Chief Plans Major Reorganization," Calendar, Dec. 13). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Restructuring of the department . . . (Nodal said) will convert the agency 
into a more 'service-oriented' organization, cutting costs by reducing grants, 
festivals . . . and relying more heavily on community partnerships to help run 
the department's citywide arts centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The department also plans to establish eight 'regional arts councils' to 
increase community 'ownership' of the arts in underserved areas of the city. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, what I want to do is develop a more comprehensive approach to the 
arts in this city," Nodal said. "There is no comprehensive program, everybody 
is doing their own thing. I hope (a staff member) can come up with a real 
marketing plan." 
</P>
<P>
 What does all of that mean? Everybody is doing their own thing? I thought that 
is what art was supposed to be. You cannot have a bureaucratic governmental 
department "market" anything unless they are going to take control of the money 
and the process and then lead us to what we are to "experience." What the 
department is doing is taking away the "experience" of the art. 
</P>
<P>
 I applaud Cultural Affairs spreading money throughout the city so that every 
segment of the population has a share. That had been a long time coming. But, 
they have forgotten one very important thing: art, its growth and continuation. 
 
</P>
<P>
 I am afraid Nodal's position has more to do with social service than with 
creativity. Are we to hinder the artists in our society by cutting back their 
ever-decreasing dollars from the city government so that a "Cultural Affairs 
Department" can take on the business of trying to heal and bandage this 
war-torn society that we live in? Why do our meager arts dollars have to become 
service-oriented dollars? If our city government had been doing its work 
properly in the first place, maybe we wouldn't have to patch up broken areas of 
Los Angeles with arts money. 
</P>
<P>
 Go and watch your City Council people at work. I've been to council meetings 
where they sit and talk and eat while people are speaking. They act much too 
pompous for public servants. 
</P>
<P>
 I want an arts vision for this city. We need more culture and arts activities 
for our children. Action-packed violence in movies and on television is not the 
legacy we need to leave behind. There has got to be a way to help artists make 
art, to grow as artists and to give their work to the community and to the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Cultural Affairs Department doesn't have a lot to do with culture. In this 
city, our culture is drying up and blowing away. Let us try to figure out a way 
to work together and stop the nonsense that never seems to end. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry James wrote in a letter to H. G. Wells: "It is art that makes life, 
makes interest, makes importance, for our consideration and application of 
these things, and I know of no substitute whatever for the force and beauty of 
its process."

TV REVIEWS; 'MANTIS' A SUPER-HERO WITHOUT A PRAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Mantis" is the kind of movie that can give an insect a bad name. 
</P>
<P>
 It airs at 8 tonight on Fox (Channels 11 and 6), introducing a comic 
(unintentionally, it appears) super-hero who wears a mantis-like gizmo on his 
head and moves through the air spritzing criminals with a paralyzing chemical 
while suspended by a chain from a high-tech flying car called a chrysalid. 
</P>
<P>
 The thankless job of playing this clunky lug has befallen Carl Lumbly. Gina 
Torres is police pathologist Amy Ellis, Bobby Hosea is a TV news reporter and 
Steve James is a youth center counselor. Well, it's work. 
</P>
<P>
 Mantis keeps his real identity secret. In his civvies, he's a biologist who 
advises the cops in Ocean City, a crime-ravaged community now existing under a 
tenuous gang truce. But someone wants to break the truce. Who? "Mantis" doesn't 
actually identify the top honcho, opening the door for "Mantis II," a chilling 
prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mantis" is directed by Sam Raimi ("Darkman") and written by Sam Hamm 
("Batman" and "Batman II"). If their intent here was to make a movie containing 
irony or a sense of humor, it doesn't show. Instead, "Mantis" is funny without 
trying to be. The special effects are unimpressive, the action sequences hokey 
and the acting wooden. It doesn't help that Lumbly's voice as Mantis is Darth 
Vader through an echo chamber, with every line he speaks resonating like a 
proclamation. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can go on destroying each other or you can live together," he tells 
gangbangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't be afraid," he tells a female reporter as he plods forward in his 
contraption outfit. "I won't hurt you." Oh, too much. Better an old-fashioned 
mantis, the kind with stout, spiny forelegs. HOWARD ROSENBERG

TV REVIEWS; 'MY NAME IS KATE' HAS STRONG MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "My Name Is Kate" (tonight at 9 on Channels 7, 3 and 10) is a well-intentioned 
story about one woman's struggle to overcome alcoholism. Indeed, this TV movie 
strives so hard to be socially constructive that at times it feels like an 
advertisement for Alcoholics Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the vast number of individuals whose lives have been adversely 
affected by alcohol addiction, that's not an entirely negative quality. This 
film could very well inspire a significant number of alcoholics to seek help. 
</P>
<P>
 But for those viewers looking for a more complex human drama, "My Name Is 
Kate" will probably disappoint. There have been enough films made about 
substance abuse that it's no longer satisfying to simply watch a 
straightforward movie about alcohol addiction. Much-used material like this 
requires new perspective or insight. Instead, this drama seems content to push 
the most obvious buttons. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, the opening segments of "My Name Is Kate" find Kate Bannister 
(Donna Mills) losing her grip on life. A professional woman with a successful 
husband (Daniel J. Travanti), a 19-year-old daughter who's married to a doctor 
and a bright teen-age son, she seems to have everything to live for. 
</P>
<P>
 But her drinking causes her to become unreliable and irrational. Soon she is 
without a job and her family is about to disown her when she finally agrees to 
admit herself into a treatment clinic for women. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Kate remains in deep denial. It takes the efforts of a nurturing 
counselor (Eileen Brennan) and several of her fellow residents at the clinic to 
make her face her drinking problem. Kate is particularly indebted to her new 
roommate (Nia Peeples), a feisty and caring Hispanic woman who is trying to 
kick a crack addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these clinic scenes seem to have been almost designed to offer hope to 
people with alcohol and drug problems. In this unusually friendly and open 
atmosphere, the counselors and residents always seem to be available to lend 
each other support and guidance. All of this is nice, but not entirely 
realistic. In addition, Kate's transition from a hostile drunk to a loving 
mother and wife is too easily made. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, "My Name Is Kate" is an earnest but deeply flawed attempt at 
making a positive social statement. JON MATSUMOTO

TV REVIEWS; 'TO MY DAUGHTER' IS RIGOROUSLY CANDID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "To My Daughter with Love," starring Rick Schroder as a newly widowed dad, is 
pretty unblinking in its depiction of the rigors of single parenthood (tonight, 
Channel 4, 9 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
 It's also unusually lachrymose and downbeat for a movie presented under the 
banner of Disney Family Classics. Sure, it's predictably heartwarming at the 
fade-out, but the rest of the story is too rigorously candid to be cheerful. 
Sentimentality takes a holiday in a script (by Michael de Guzman) that almost 
feels autobiographical. 
</P>
<P>
 Schroder, now in his early 20s and no longer Rick-y, is still boyish enough to 
mirror a husband and father who's barely out of boyhood himself when his life 
takes a tragic turn. His almost-perfect wife (Megan Gallivan) suddenly dies, 
leaving him classically ill-prepared to cope with a young daughter in primary 
school grappling with great adjustments of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 Schroder's character, a construction worker with few prospects who likes to go 
bowling with the boys, is in over his head merely making his daughter's peanut 
butter-and-jelly sandwiches or arriving for appointments on time.  
</P>
<P>
 But his major struggle is the girl's over-solicitous grandparents ("Dallas's " 
Linda Gray and Lawrence Pressman) who live in a big cozy house and weave an 
agenda to bring up the little girl themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl (Ashley Malinger) is wisely directed by Kevin Hooks to be not so much 
cute and sweet as a real troubled little girl painfully missing her mom and 
quick to hurt everybody around her. 
</P>
<P>
 Lending dimension is Gray's elitist grandmother, a snobbish figure chillingly 
rendered, and Khandi Alexander as another single parent who befriends the 
fast-maturing Schroder character without, refreshingly, becoming a romantic 
interest. It's rare enough in movies to find an eligible, not to mention 
attractively interracial couple who are happy just being platonic buddies. 
</P>
<P>
 Choosing not to be saccharine, the movie opts to be tougher than expected. RAY

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TODAY'S AGENDA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week, parks in the San Fernando Valley filled up with people made 
temporarily homeless by the earthquake, and we understood in new ways the value 
of our public spaces. This time, they were a rough but available refuge from 
fright. 
</P>
<P>
 But even in normal times, our parks and other public spaces are safety valves 
of a sort. As cities get more crowded, the need for space beyond one's own 
dwelling grows, says architect Judith Sheine, who teaches at the UCLA graduate 
school of architecture. "Public spaces let us play tennis, take a walk, just 
get away from the family." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheine came here from New York, "where people live in tiny spaces," and have 
tremendous need of public space. But Southern California is growing steadily 
more dense and "the need is going to increase," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes a good public space? That's what a new feature, Favorite Places, 
will look at. The only requirements for the feature are that they be places in 
Southern California that are free and public. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, a great big space like Griffith Park is wonderful, says Sheine. 
"Los Angeles is tending to form ethnic enclaves, and the larger public spaces 
like Griffith Park bring different ethnic groups together for shared 
activities, particularly recreation with children. Parks also let people know 
there are people who share similar recreation goals, from concerts to rose 
gardening." But shopping districts, farmers markets and urban plazas can also 
be great public spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grand Central Market in Los Angeles, Third St. Promenade in Santa Monica, Old 
Town Pasadena and Larchmont Village are small-scale pedestrian shopping areas 
where there is seating and food and good people-watching," says Sheine. "It has 
to do with scale and use. In Italy, all the great public squares have 
restaurants and kiosks and public farm markets on certain days of the week. 
They provide a shared environment where you see people regularly, but not the 
same people you work and live with." 
</P>
<P>
 The identifying measure of a public space is that it's publicly owned, says 
architect and urban designer Chris Miller Fisher. "In Southern California, that 
often means the sidewalks. There's a big difference between a street-level 
shopping area and a mall, which is privately owned and a regulated space." 
</P>
<P>
 Are there bad public spaces? Yes, indeed, says Sheine. "In Southern 
California, a lot of new high-rises have 'public spaces' at their base, but 
they're really pretty miserable. Builders were required to do this to get their 
building permits, but they really don't want to attract people. So they make it 
barren -- they build a big plaza with a sculpture and that's all." 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California "needs more kinds of public spaces," says Fisher. "We need 
more places to walk your dog, enjoy grass and trees within walking distance of 
your home, as well as the great urban squares where people can gather for 
festivals and celebrations." 
</P>
<P>
 Voices invites readers to suggest their favorite places. Call, write or fax -- 
information is in the box at right.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: SERMON; ON 
CONNECTING THE VIOLENCE OF NATURE AND MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIANNE WILLIAMSON, Marianne Williamson is a spiritual adviser and author 
of Return to Love and A Woman's Worth (Random House). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I love those articles that we see everywhere, telling us what psychologists 
have to say about earthquakes and human reaction: 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, first, people are completely shocked. Then they take stock." 
</P>
<P>
 Gee, guys, thank you . 
</P>
<P>
 I've seen the post-earthquake reactions of geologists, politicians, 
psychologists and, of course, all those "everymen" they keep quoting -- but I 
have not seen one question addressed publicly to a priest, rabbi, minister or 
other spirituoso. 
</P>
<P>
 Now this is very interesting, considering the fact that on January 17 at 4:31 
a.m. and in the minutes following, more Los Angeles residents called on God, I 
dare say, than called any politician, psychologist or geologist.  
</P>
<P>
 Once the violent shaking stopped, of course, we all went back to pretending en 
masse that God had nothing to do with this. 
</P>
<P>
 Which, in a way, I don't believe He did. But I think there's a very good 
reason why we called on Him when it happened. We called on Him for help, and I 
would suggest we stay on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Will we remain in our spiritual stupor now, or be willing to awaken from our 
penchant for mass denial? Will we continue to see no connection between the 
violence in our minds and the violence beginning to cascade around us? How many 
riots, fires and earthquakes will it take before we start looking for some 
inner clues? Los Angeles is being challenged now to find our depth, to grow 
into wisdom. Let's search for some deeper meaning here. In the words of author 
Elie Wiesel, "To live through dramatic events is not enough; one has to share 
them and transform them into acts of conscience." 
</P>
<P>
 God help us if everything that goes around, comes around: Violence, after all, 
is our primary cultural export. 
</P>
<P>
 This earthquake emanated from a point miles beneath the surface. So do all of 
our problems emanate from beneath the surface of things, and no windows of hope 
will open for this or any other city in trouble until we start addressing 
what's happening deep inside each of us. 
</P>
<P>
 Deep inside, we are very sad to be living in a world so disconnected from our 
souls. I see very little soul on TV. I see very little soul in the news. I see 
very little soul in American popular culture. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are places where it does burst forth: in transcendent movies, and 
music, and sincerely said prayers. Those who hold the banner of spiritual truth 
-- and every artist, philosopher and lover does -- are holding out hope that 
Los Angeles can heal itself. With every prayer, we heal. With every act of 
beauty, we heal. With every act of love, we heal. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything else is nonsense. If we remember this, there's hope.

 Part-time work is a way of life for many young people, but that first 
full-time career-oriented job is different. What's the key to finding a good 
job? What is a good job? These and other questions are asked in this new 
occasional feature, First Job. If you've had an interesting experience, write 
or call Voices about it. LISA-ANNE SAMUELS 
</P>
<P>
 Television production assistant, Universal City, 23 
</P>
<P>
 I was an English major with an emphasis in theater at Randolph-Macon College 
in Ashland, Va. I knew I wanted to be a part of theater. That didn't work, 
however. So I took three weeks to drive out here to look for work in 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 My resume got on the right person's desk and that person passed it on and I 
got very lucky. They hired me to be a production assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually a PA does anything people tells them to do -- from making coffee to 
running out and buying supplies. I have been assisting the executive producer. 
I help by typing the budget and schedule for the associate producer. I help 
schedule meetings and take care of clerical duties.  
</P>
<P>
 A PA needs to be enthusiastic, know about the industry and know how to operate 
different computer programs. After that, everything is just luck. 
</P>
<P>
 My advice to others trying to break into this business is don't be afraid to 
ask someone you know for help. Ask them to please pass around your resume. 
Don't be afraid to work your first job for free. And work hard. You might start 
at 8 a.m. and leave at 7 p.m. or later. CAROL SAKAI 
</P>
<P>
 Accountant, Deloitte & Touche, Montebello, 23  
</P>
<P>
 Deloitte & Touche is one of the top six international accounting firms in the 
nation. I was supposed to work here after I finished my undergraduate studies, 
but they extended my offer for another year so I could go back and get my 
master's degree. They gave me the summer off and I started in September.  
</P>
<P>
 When I was an undergraduate, I got involved in a lot of student accounting 
organizations such as Beta Alpha Psi, the national accounting fraternity. In my 
senior year I went through a series of interviews. I received a number of 
offers. I decided to work for Deloitte & Touche. They just had more 
opportunities. The master's degree helped, but most of this work is on-the-job 
training. I learned a lot of theoretical and conceptual information, but I'm 
learning practical application. I've met a lot of interesting people who have a 
lot of experience. 
</P>
<P>
 My advice to anyone who wants to work in the accounting field is to set your 
goals and achieve them. Don't give up because sooner or later you'll make it. 
It all depends on how much work you're willing to put in. And I want to break a 
couple of stereotypes: First, you don't have to be good in math to go into 
accounting. You just need to be logical and have a sense of business. Second, 
accountants aren't boring people. JOHN GEREAU 
</P>
<P>
 Design specialist, TRW Space and Electronics Group, Redondo Beach, 24 
</P>
<P>
 I graduated from UCLA in 1992. I design mechanical parts for satellite 
structures.  
</P>
<P>
 When I was a sophomore in college I was on a scholarship program at TRW 
through the Minority Engineering Program at UCLA. I had an internship here that 
was supposed to lead to a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything was going great, but when I graduated, the company was laying 
people off. I ended up getting a job in another place. I kept in touch with my 
old manager. When things leveled off, he offered me a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who wants to pursue a career in this industry needs to get internships 
for experience and to network with people. They also should know that there may 
not be jobs available when they graduate because of all the cutbacks. Out of 
all the people I knew who were studying to be an engineer, I'm the only one 
working as one. DESMOND BLACKBURN 
</P>
<P>
 Marketing director, KMAX radio, Pasadena, 25  
</P>
<P>
 I ran a small part-time janitorial business while attending Cal State 
Northridge's journalism classes. Although the business was doing well enough 
for me to pay my bills, I really felt this conviction deep in my heart that I 
wanted to be in broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
 I contacted a friend who referred me to a radio station in Ventura. We met and 
he hired me as a sales representative. That was a tough move for me. It was a 
straight commission job for a small radio station chain. 
</P>
<P>
 There were times when I was barely eating. But I would always go beyond the 
call of duty to distinguish myself as a dedicated worker. I came in really 
excited about the position. I got my business plan together to help me 
accomplish my goals and expand business for the station. Ironically, the guy 
who hired me was fired and the station offered me the job after about a month. 
It turned out I would get a base salary, benefits and commission. My primary 
duty is to get sponsors on the air to fund our gospel segment. My other duties 
include everything from public relations and copy writing to on-air announcing. 
</P>
<P>
 My advice to other people who want to break into radio is don't be afraid to 
work for free. A lot of internships just let you answer the phones and make 
coffee. Volunteer for everything and make sure you're learning concrete skills.

 In San Pedro, a working-class town that is home to the nation's busiest 
commercial port, the Los Angeles Maritime Institute introduces youths from 
disadvantaged backgrounds to sailing. Educational programs aboard ships have 
long provided young people with character-building experiences, but most such 
programs are costly. The institute was founded in 1992 by San Pedro resident 
Jim Gladson, a retired science teacher who coordinated school-sposored sailing 
trips for students and staff in the Los Angeles Unified School District for 
nearly 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants sail with an instructional crew on the Swift of Ipswich, a 
donated 70-foot schooner once owned by actor James Cagney. Youths learn about 
teamwork and responsibility by understanding the vessel and mastering tasks 
such as raising sails, helping to plot and monitoring radio transmissions. The 
modest operation, which has served about 50 young people so far, relies on 
funding from youth groups and charitable public agencies. Office space is 
donated by the Los Angeles Maritime Museum, with which the institute is 
affiliated.

<P>
 In low-income housing the only people who have money are people are doing 
something illegal. Sometimes such people end up being glorified. If you show 
these kids other things to do than the way they've been living life, they can 
learn that there's more than what's in the neighborhood. Some of the kids here 
participated in the program, and some of them had been were flirting with the 
gangs. We went out about eight times on the ship.  
</P>
<P>
 When you take them onto a ship where there's not a lot of room and there's a 
lot of work to do you get them a little disoriented and suddenly they have to 
learn how to depend on each other. They don't just learn about sailing -- they 
take ownership of the experience. They even voted out somebody who was causing 
a lot of problems. Since the trips the kids have come to me and suggested other 
services for the residents here. They see themselves as a kind of youth council 
representing Harbor Hills. STUDENT

<P>
 I live in Harbor Hills. My favorite part on the Swift was working hard, 
pulling the ropes; the part I didn't like was that there weren't any showers. 
Instead of being here with nothing to do, the sailing taught us to look at the 
sea as more than just water -- it's a place to go to, it's a place to take care 
of. I learned that you can put your mind to anything and it doesn't matter if 
you're a male or female, you can do anything if you try. I tried for myself and 
I did it -- I steered that boat. I used to have a bad attitude and I think the 
sailing brought me closer to people because it taught me about teamwork. AN

 Director of Communication for Associated Marine Institute, a private,

school-referred youth 
</P>
<P>
 Programs for kids "at risk" are a great idea, because you catch them before 
they've broken the law -- you're doing preventive work. I don't think it's the 
sailing or the marine setting that makes it effective -- it's taking kids out 
of their environment, giving them something challenging to do and showing them 
that they can do something different. And this way the kids get to feel they 
belong. Sailing is one way to teach that because if you're in charge of the jib 
or the mainmast, you've got to be there -- you can't be down below drinking a 
Coke because you'll run aground. You learn that everyone's depending on you and 
that you can be depended on. TO GET INVOLVED

 I lost a lot of things in this earthquake. The one thing that came out of this 
is that the most important thing is my family. When it started, I woke up, and 
when I tried to get my brother, he was shaking and couldn't move. My mom got 
us. My dad was holding up these bookshelves because if he hadn't, they would 
have fallen on my mom. He was pretty calm. He had the flashlight and turned off 
the gas. Before this earthquake, I thought I was prepared. You hear about it at 
school and on TV so you think, "It won't happen to me." Well it did, and I 
don't think I was ready. I don't think anybody is really ready. It's OK now.

 When the earthquake hit, I thought I was dreaming. But when I realized we were 
in an earthquake, I started to panic. I kept thinking about my family and 
friends. I'm still having trouble sleeping because those aftershocks are really 
bothering me. I want to leave. I want to live somewhere where there aren't 
earthquakes. I don't know, I guess I wasn't prepared. Next time, I'll have a

 I was a little bit scared. I ran into the hall and my mom grabbed me. We're

 The quake really scared me. My first concern was that my family was OK. We 
have a lot of relatives in the Midwest. I was worried how much they were going 
to worry about us because we had no way of getting in touch with them. Then, 
when I saw all our plates were on the floor in the kitchen and how we hardly 
had any dishes left, I realized it was going to be kind of tough for awhile. 
</P>
<P>
 Not being able to take a shower made me realize how important are the normal 
things you take for granted. We went over to some friends and were able to 
shower. I've never felt so clean. 
</P>
<P>
 I think how important it is that my friends, my family and my dogs are OK. I'm 
happy my school's OK because we won't have to be transferred and things will 
get back to normal.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm a person who saves a lot of things. I have all my school work from seventh 
grade. I was looking in my closet that was totally destroyed and realized that 
things I used to think were important aren't really necessities.

for minor cuts and bruises. 
</P>

 I knew two of the people who were rescued from that housing project that 
collapsed. That was pretty frightening because it hits home to think that

out of here now. I've survived this one but I don't want to be here for the Big 
One. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake put a lot of other things in perspective. I have a very big 
family that doesn't talk very much and we're spread out over the San Fernando 
Valley. Boy, did we get the network going real quick. In a way it brought the 
family closer together.

 It was the most terrifying thing that I've ever experienced in my life. I 
honestly thought I could die right there and there was nothing I could do. So I 
tried to be calm about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, I helped some friends whose home had been damaged. It was a good 
experience to share, helping clean things up. I want to help with other things 
in the future. There are lots of things, especially in L.A., that you can help 
with.

 I believe in God, so I understand what He's doing -- just giving the world a 
reality check. People really calmed down. Basically, they were scared and 
worried about if any other thing was going to happen. They slowed their lives 
down and took time to spend with their families. It's something people usually 
don't do.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: COMMUNITY ESSAY; 
'THE BLACK MALE CRISIS IS REAL'; THERE ARE SOME BRIGHT SPOTS, BUT BLACK 
PROFESSIONALS NEED TO APPLY MORE EFFORT TO TRAINING BLACK YOUTHS AND FINDING 
AND CREATING JOBS FOR THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL OFARI HUTCHINSON, Earl Ofari Hutchinson is the author of The 
Assassination of the Black Male Image, due in April from Middle Passage Press. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Children's Defense Fund Director Marian Wright Edelman has launched a new 
campaign to "save black males." In the past, the fund lobbied, cajoled and even 
tried to shame public officials and business leaders into increasing funding 
and developing policy initiatives for the nation's children. But this time 
she's directly challenging black professional and business people to take 
responsibility for "rescuing" young black men. Edelman is on target for three 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 * The black middle class is highly educated and possesses skills and economic 
clout. Black professionals are the role models of success and achievement that 
young black males desperately need to interact with. 
</P>
<P>
 * The government won't do the job. As cities like Los Angeles face massive 
budget deficits and hunt for ways to cut local programs and services, the 
chances of a massive infusion of dollars to expand public services and jobs and 
social programs are remote. 
</P>
<P>
 * The black male crisis is real. The California Assembly Commission on the 
Status of the African American Male recently underscored the magnitude of the 
crisis. It reported that four out of 10 felons entering California prisons are 
black males. Less than half of lower-income black males under age 29 live in 
two-parent households. And black males in California with a high-school 
education are twice as likely as white males to be unemployed, according to a 
state legislative study. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this is not to say that the situation of young black women is 
unimportant, only that the situation of young black men is dire. The crisis has 
had deadly consequences on the streets of Los Angeles. According to the 
National Center for Health Statistics, from 1985 to 1989, Los Angeles beat out 
Washington as the nation's murder capital. Nearly all the gunshot victims were 
young black and Latino males. In addition, although African Americans make up 
only 11% of L.A. County's population, nearly half the children referred to the 
county-run MacLaren Children's Center because of abuse or neglect are African 
American. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some bright spots. A growing number of black parents and 
professionals in Los Angeles has answered Edelman's challenge. The 100 Black 
Men organization sponsors mentoring programs and provides scholarships and 
grants to young blacks. In early November, state Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los 
Angeles) convened a daylong black male crisis conference in South-Central. At 
the conference, black professionals and business leaders shared their 
experiences with hundreds of high school and junior high school students. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Charles Drew University of Medicine and Science in the 
Watts-Willowbrook area sponsored a conference in which local educators, 
businesspeople and professionals provided parents with learning tips and 
materials to help them improve the study habits of their children. The MacLaren 
Center also has begun a program to train African American and Latino volunteer 
advocates in child counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, I've been proud to take part in the Models for Success program 
sponsored by the L.A. Chapter of Omega Psi Phi fraternity. The program, held 
each January, is aimed at young black males. Black professionals present 
seminars on topics ranging from cultural awareness to career planning. 
</P>
<P>
 The efforts of black professionals and parents are paying off. Last year, 75% 
of young black males graduated from high school nationally. And these young men 
also appear less likely to use drugs and alcohol than young whites. Meanwhile, 
most unemployed young black males continue to actively search for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But this isn't enough. There are too many black males who have fallen, or are 
in danger of falling, victim to the streets. They must be given hope. The most 
urgent need is to focus on job and skills training. There are two immediate 
ways that black professionals and business leaders can act. They can organize 
or conduct biweekly or monthly training workshops that emphasize math, science, 
data processing, computer programming, reading and writing skills. The 
workshops could offer pointers on proper grooming, dress and manners as well as 
instruction in job search, application and interview techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, black entrepreneurs could train and counsel in business management, 
marketing, leasing, franchising, financial planning and investments. And 
African American churches, neighborhood centers, service agencies and 
businesses could donate facilities, reading materials and equipment for the 
workshops. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with these efforts, the volatile mix of unemployment, poverty, 
frustration and despair will continue to drive some young black males to the 
streets. But a rescue program initiated by black professionals can do much to 
decrease their ranks.

<P>
 A visiting music professor from Java has a confusing time when he arrives to 
teach at an American university. His hospitable colleagues frequently invite 
him to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would you like something to eat?" they ask him. 
</P>
<P>
 He always declines the first offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, his hosts again inquire, "Are you sure you wouldn't like something to 
eat?" 
</P>
<P>
 He assures them that he does not desire any food.  
</P>
<P>
 The American hosts do not ask again. They assume that their guest does not 
like American food or that it disagrees with him. They are unaware that he is 
actually hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 For Javanese people, food must be offered three times before guests can say 
yes. And they are not the only ones who believe it is impolite to accept the 
first offer. Filipinos often refuse the first time and Koreans frequently wait 
until after the third invitation before accepting. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for the visiting Javanese professor, Americans usually do not 
offer food three times. To do so seems like we are pushing food upon our 
guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Rule: If your guests decline the first offer of food or drink, offer it at 
least two more times to keep them from seeing themselves as impolite. Or 
automatically serve refreshments right away to relieve guests of the pressure 
of propriety.

 "On Sunday morning I like to go to the Farmer's Market in Hollywood. It's the 
way they shop in Europe.They go out with a basket and buy fresh things. They 
close the street off. There's street entertainment. It's much more fun than the 
supermarket, and the produce is fresher. People have their own home businesses, 
like curing olives. Some people bring baked goods. Vendors wander through the 
crowd -- like a peach salesman -- he'll wander through the crowd giving 
samples. I always run into friends. It makes L.A. a little bit more livable. 
Hollywood can be trashy, but on Sunday morning the community takes over the 
street. It's a venue for getting people together."

<P>
 The market is on Ivar Avenue between Hollywood and Sunset boulevards. It is 
held every Sunday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and includes a crafts fair. The market 
is run by Hollywood Economic Revitalization Effort. It was started with 
redevelopment funds but now operates independently.

 There's been a lot of ink spilled regarding welfare and welfare reform.One 
fact that has been consistently ignored by The Times and many other newspapers 
is that some welfare recipients, myself included, work 72 hours/month for $226 
in cash and, approximately $110 in food stamps. That computes to $4.66/hour. 
Those of us who work are not being given anything.

FOR VICTIMS, SPEED IS OF THE ESSENCE; FEDERAL DISASTER AGENCY IS OVERWHELMED 
BUT UNDAUNTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of Southern Californians are hungry, homeless and, in some cases, 
nearly penniless. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, and other federal, 
state and local disaster officials, are making progress on their pledge to 
speed up relief efforts. But, for many victims, exasperating waits continue. 
It's true that FEMA, the Red Cross and all the other hard-working relief 
agencies are being asked to do the impossible. But anything less than that will 
fall short of what's needed. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, compassionate disaster officials led by FEMA Director James 
Lee Witt zeroed in on the most vulnerable families, those who continue to camp 
outdoors in city parks. When rain and colder weather threatened, they asked the 
National Guard to put up tents -- a considerable improvement on the lean-tos 
and other makeshift shelters of blankets and sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 THE CRUSH: FEMA also deserves credit because President Clinton's emergency 
response team, which included Witt, housing secretary Henry G. Cisneros and 
transportation secretary Federico Pena, got here in a hurry. Along with 
dedicated -- and at times exhausted -- state, county and city officials, FEMA 
opened the first disaster assistance centers three days after the quake -- five 
days ahead of the response to Florida's Hurricane Andrew. Good start. Even so, 
the first centers understandably fell short of meeting the overwhelming need. 
</P>
<P>
 On opening day, the 11 disaster assistance centers, overwhelmed by the crowds, 
provided little immediate comfort to the thousands of people who waited for 
hours in line. Many were given mystifying appointments to return as late as 
mid-February. What they needed was a roof over their heads immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton noticed and has asked for $4 billion in federal earthquake 
aid, authorizing up to 30 disaster centers to speed aid distribution. Twenty 
disaster centers were expected to be open today, staffed with the help of 1,000 
state employees and 1,000 federal workers sent from across the nation and 
Puerto Rico. Cisneros, the bilingual housing secretary, was also communicating 
in Spanish at the camps and on Spanish-language media to get information to 
Latino victims. This is most helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 VOUCHERS FOR VICTIMS: Cisneros also expedited the distribution of federal 
housing vouchers to get earthquake victims out of tents and shelters and into 
more permanent housing as quickly as possible. Well over 2,000 families 
received those coveted certificates over the weekend. As many as 10,000 housing 
subsidies are available to help low-and-moderate-income people who lost homes 
and, in some cases, jobs because of the Northridge earthquake. Newly poor or 
unemployed victims can also qualify for vouchers for rooms at moderate-priced 
hotels, thanks to fast work by the L.A. County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 All who lost their homes, whether rented or owned, may qualify for FEMA grants 
to pay for temporary rental quarters or repairs. FEMA is shortening the process 
to get those checks out more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, one week after the earthquake, thousands remain without an address of 
their own; more than 27,000 have applied for help. Witt, the FEMA director, 
points out that this nation has never had to respond to a housing disaster of 
this magnitude. But a week on a cot or in a tent can seem like forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the obstacles -- bureaucratic or otherwise -- they must be quickly 
overcome. And care needs to be taken to avoid creating unnecessary ones. Senate 
minority leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said Congress should finance the earthquake 
aid with hard-to-find spending cuts. This is a standard not applied to previous 
disasters -- and a potentially devastating cause of delay. Dole should back off 
-- or people may remember him the next time a string of tornadoes hits Kansas.

IS THE SUMMIT NOW IMPERILED?; REFORM PRIME MINISTER HAS GROUND KNOCKED OUT FROM 
UNDER HIM BY JAPANESE PARLIAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The question Washington has to be asking now is whether it makes any sense to 
go ahead with the planned summit on Feb. 11 between President Clinton and the 
progressive but embattled Japanese prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 To American eyes and ears, Morihiro Hosokawa has been little short of a 
godsend. Since taking office five months ago, the reform-minded prime minister 
has seemed to be exactly what the doctor ordered for soothing tense 
U.S.-Japanese relations. He has begun to open up markets, even the seemingly 
sacred rice trade, and has signaled across the Pacific that he favors more open 
trade and deregulated markets -- even a tax cut for Japanese consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday, this new-age politician suffered a stunning, potentially 
devastating defeat in the upper house of Japan's Parliament when his reform 
proposals were quashed. It was a huge setback -- the first time since 1951 that 
any government-submitted bill had been voted down. 
</P>
<P>
 Ominously, two previous governments were toppled on the issue of political 
reform. Worse yet, Hosokawa had staked the very rationale of his government on 
achieving reform before proceeding on other issues. Does Friday's vote mean the 
brilliant Mr. Hosokawa's political end is near? 
</P>
<P>
 One certainly hopes not. Perhaps Hosokawa can stay on his feet, pointing out 
that his governing coalition at least made a good try at the biggest reform in 
Japan's electoral system since the U.S.-written constitution was put into 
effect in 1947. In fact, after his defeat, Hosokawa could have resigned or 
called for new parliamentary elections. Instead, for better or for worse, he 
has opted to try for a compromise with his opponents. But that won't be easy -- 
and the deadline for a deal is Saturday, when the legislative session is 
scheduled to end. 
</P>
<P>
 If somehow they still could be enacted, Hosokawa's reforms would help Japan 
emerge from its gridlocked, tradition-bound system. They would also be valuable 
to the United States. The political disarray in Japan is a potentially severe 
and possibly fatal setback to ongoing U.S.-Japan trade talks. Only a stable 
Tokyo can focus on Japan's many current problems, including the brewing 
showdown with a Clinton Administration determined to bring down a $50-billion 
trade deficit with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa has indicated no plans to call a new election -- a move that would 
escalate the stakes in Japan. But that might be precisely the card to play if 
Parliament is ever to wake up. Moreoever, a new election would give Japanese 
voters a chance to boot out old-style politicians who have repeatedly blocked 
political reform. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what path Hosokawa takes, the trade imbalance has become intolerable 
and must be reduced. The Japanese Parliament has simply made the road rougher.

U.S. POWS IN LAOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "U.S. Fliers Believed Held by Laos at Vietnam War's End," Jan. 2: Laos was 
subjected to four years (1965-69) of intensive bombing by American warplanes 
while representatives of the U.S. government officially denied that it was 
happening. 
</P>
<P>
 That policy of denial has constituted one of the difficulties in finding those 
American crew members who managed to survive the destruction of their aircraft, 
or even to acquire reliable information about them.(If the U.S. was not bombing 
Laos, how could there be American airmen there?) 
</P>
<P>
 The lingering MIA issue, which has brought so much suffering to the families 
of those lost Americans, is another tragic consequence of that "dirty little 
war" in Southeast Asia; yet, it pales in significance before the realization of 
what the Lao people suffered in that four-year period.

'THREE STRIKES' LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Harris' column, "Calling That Third Strike Against Felons" (Jan. 13), 
said I had "grave doubts" about "three strikes" laws. What I told him was not 
all against these measures, which I said would be better than the mandatory 
long-term penalties on first offenses that have helped to unbalance our state 
budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 I mentioned that statistically, offenders who have had an appreciable period 
of non-criminal life between crimes are much better risks for release than are 
those who, from an early age on, have been continuously in crime when not 
confined. I added that house arrest with electronic monitoring, community 
service and fines have been more effective than confinement for reducing 
recidivism rates of lawbreakers with few or no prior offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 One way to reduce crime and costs from "three strikes" laws would be not to 
count crimes followed by five or more years of no further convictions when 
free, provided the defendant's legitimate income accounts for his or her 
expenditures in this period. Another way would be to permit up to the last 
third of prison terms to be served in halfway houses or electronically 
monitored parole supervision, which -- if well-run -- would both aid transition 
to law-abiding lives and permit prompt rearrest if crime is resumed. Most 
important would be rigorous statistical research to assess the effectiveness of 
such provisions.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE; OUR LIFELINES ARE ALSO OUR ACHILLES' 
HEELS; BESIDES BUILDINGS, WE MUST PROTECT ELECTRICITY, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, 
TRANSPORTATION AND WATER AND SEWER SYSTEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By IAN G. BUCKLE, Ian G. Buckle is deputy director of the National Center for 
Earthquake Engineering Research at the State University of New York in Buffalo.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The built environment for a city like Los Angeles can be divided into two 
categories: the buildings in which we live and work and those utilities, 
services and facilities that enable us to educate our children, increase 
productivity, protect ourselves against disease, live in peace and enjoy an 
unparalleled standard of living. 
</P>
<P>
 This second category, the civil infrastructure, can be further divided into 
public buildings and five lifelines: electric power, gas and liquid fuels, 
telecommunications, transportation and water and sewer systems. These provide 
the foundation on which modern society has built its wealth and quality of 
life.  
</P>
<P>
 Since World War II, the United States has invested heavily in its 
infrastructure and has developed some of the most sophisticated lifelines in 
the world. Most of our food, shelter, health care, commerce and defense depends 
on an intricate network of interdependent lifelines. It has been said that 
lifelines are both the lubricant that speeds a society's development and the 
glue that binds us together. But for whatever reason, their existence is almost 
always taken for granted and their availability at minimal cost is considered 
to be the right of every citizen. Yet they are surprisingly fragile. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4:31 a.m. last Monday, a moderate-sized earthquake in the San Fernando 
Valley paralyzed portions of one of the world's largest cities. Electric supply 
was lost, bridges collapsed, major freeways were closed, water mains and gas 
lines ruptured, fires broke out, dams and reservoirs were damaged and a train 
loaded with toxic materials overturned. Los Angeles, a city that lives on the 
edge, awoke to find itself on the brink of a major disaster. Fortunately, few 
people were on the streets at the time, but reconstruction will take many 
years. For some people, the emotional scars and financial impact will last a 
lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 History repeats itself in surprising ways. The 1971 earthquake at Sylmar in 
the San Fernando Valley was of similar magnitude, and it too played havoc with 
our lifelines. In fact, the damage sustained in 1971 drew national attention to 
the importance and fragility of these systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The Technical Council for Lifeline Earthquake Engineering was formed soon 
afterward by the American Society of Civil Engineers, with the object of 
improving the performance of lifelines in earthquakes. But progress has been 
hampered by the very nature of lifelines, their interdependence and the 
conflicting interests of the many owners with jurisdiction over these systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Lifelines have been largely neglected by the research community since they 
have not been perceived to be as important as buildings when mitigating the 
loss of life and protecting property. Funding agencies have also been slow to 
recognize the importance of lifeline research and the development of design 
criteria. This situation has improved slightly in recent years, but with the 
exception of highway bridges, there are still no federal or state codes for the 
seismic design of lifelines.  
</P>
<P>
 Some owners of large utilities in Southern California have developed their own 
standards, and they are to be commended for this action. But this voluntary 
effort is fragmentary at best and inadequate to the public interest. This is 
because most lifelines are linear systems with little redundancy and are only 
as robust as their weakest link. All elements of the system and all 
interdependent systems need to be designed to the same set of seismic criteria 
to assure their continued operation during and after a major earthquake. The 
most expeditious way to achieve this is through the adoption of nation- ally 
applicable seismic standards for lifelines. 
</P>
<P>
 It follows that lifelines are the Achilles' heel of modern society. They are 
the unprotected segment of our built environment without which life as we know 
it would cease to exist. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage to the lifelines in 1971, and again this last week, is the writing 
on the wall for the community and for state and federal decision-makers. 
Seismic standards for lifelines must be developed and adopted before the next 
magnitude 6 or larger earthquake pushes Los Angeles over the edge.

NORTH KOREA'S DEPICTION AS OGRE IS MOSTLY HYPE; PEACE: TENSIONS REMAIN HIGH BUT 
THE OPENING IS THERE IF U.S. AGENCIES AND MEDIA TURN DOWN THE RHETORIC ABOUT 
THE NORTH.

 Any attempt to use military means to force North Korea to comply with 
inspections of its nuclear facilities could bring catastrophic results to the 
Korean peninsula and the tens of thousands of Americans residing there. It is 
for that reason that the recent agreement fostered by the unprecedented 
cooperation between the United States and North Korea is encouraging. Yet, the 
portrayal of North Korea, particularly on the issue of nuclear development, by 
the Pentagon, by U.S. intelligence agencies and by the media is extremely 
disconcerting. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Cold War continues on the Korean peninsula, there has never been 
so much optimism among Koreans and Korea-watchers as there is today that the 
40-year standoff between the South and North can be ended, resulting in the 
peaceful reunification of Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the United States and North Korea have made political concessions in the 
name of peace. In 1991, President Bush withdrew nuclear weapons that had been 
kept in South Korea since 1957. President Clinton is considering canceling 
"Team Spirit," the military exercise that the United States has held in South 
Korea since 1976. This annual event had been a particularly imposing threat to 
the fragile peace since it involved 200,000 U.S. troops and practice in the use 
of tactical nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Reciprocally, North Korea has entered into high-level talks with the United 
States and has also shown a willingness to compromise on a number of political 
issues. Most notable was North Korea's consent to six inspections of its 
facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency between May, 1992, and 
February, 1993. Furthermore, both North Korea and the United States 
demonstrated a willingness to cooperate through a U.S. sale to North Korea of 
light-water reactors. This would allow North Korea to shelve its old 
plutonium-producing graphite reactors, thereby reducing the possibility that it 
could create nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only when the CIA charged that nuclear development might have taken 
place at a sensitive military base that North Korea denied the IAEA permission 
to inspect this additional site, thus provoking the most recent crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is there so much attention to a possible North Korean threat? During the 
Cold War, the CIA and the Pentagon commanded huge budgets. But in the absence 
of a threat from the Soviet Union, these institutions must now identify new 
enemies to justify their funding.  
</P>
<P>
 Another area of great concern is the media's distortion of the North Korean 
situation. From the portrayal of North Korean leader Kim Il Sung as another 
Saddam Hussein to headlines in major U.S. media, the coverage has been 
misleading at best and warmongering at worst. 
</P>
<P>
 The headline on a front-page article in the Los Angeles Times claimed that 51% 
of Americans polled said that they would support the use of force as a way to 
deal with the North Korean nuclear issue. However, it turns out that of 1,616 
Americans surveyed, only 3% -- or 48 individuals -- were concerned with foreign 
issues at all. When asked specifically which foreign issues were most 
important, the North Korean issue ranked third behind trade and the Bosnian 
crisis.  
</P>
<P>
 Because other national media pick up such reports, their significance goes 
beyond just one headline of one issue of one newspaper. Further, such 
sensationalistic journalism manipulates public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans do not want another Korean War. The last one left millions dead; 
130,000 U.S. casualties and 5,000 missing in action. Today, war tensions 
between the North and South remain high. Only a cease-fire keeps the Koreas at 
peace. Another war on the Korean peninsula would exact a toll far greater than 
the last one and would also heavily involve U.S. forces. Therefore, it is 
crucial that we continue to support the slow yet constructive advances made 
toward a peaceful resolution to the current situation, the signing of an 
armistice treaty and the peaceful reconciliation between the Koreas.

AGE-OLD SCHISMS DEFINE ENTRY TO WESTERN ALLIANCE; NATO: THE CHRISTIAN ELITE'S 
DISDAIN FOR THE ORTHODOX AND MUSLIM EAST IS AN IMPEDIMENT TO BUILDING A MODERN 
EUROPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT GERALD LIVINGSTON, Robert Gerald Livingston directs the American 
Institute for Contemporary German Studies at the Johns Hopkins University in 
Washington.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Americans need to understand that ancient cultural divisions underlie today's 
military-strategic argument between the Clinton Administration and the East 
Europeans about where to "draw the line" in Europe, whether to bring Eastern 
European countries into the Atlantic Alliance (NATO) quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of NATO's Western European members also, especially the Germans, would 
prefer an alliance based on a simple -- if always unspoken -- principle that 
gives the European Union, formerly the European Community, its cultural 
identity: If your country is Roman Catholic or Protestant in heritage then you 
are suited for NATO membership sooner rather than later. But if yours is an 
Orthodox or Muslim nation you are not fit to be an alliance (or European Union) 
member now or probably ever. 
</P>
<P>
 All four of the Eastern European countries that have been pleading for quick 
admission into the alliance are fundamentally Catholic in their culture -- 
Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic. That historical tradition 
drives their present insistence that they be recognized as part of the West 
through rapid admittance into the NATO alliance. Russia and Ukraine, which the 
President visited after his stopovers in Brussels and Prague, belong to the 
Orthodox tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Historical antecedents reaching back centuries lend powerful force to appeals 
by Poles, particularly, that the line between East and West be drawn once 
again, in 1994, where it was for so long before the two world wars. Division 
between Catholic and Orthodox Christianity in the eastern part of Europe and 
the Balkans, in fact, goes very far back indeed -- to the great schism of 1054 
between the bishop at Rome and the patriarch at Constantinople. 
</P>
<P>
 Age-old fears in modern guise about dangerous barbarians to the east and 
southeast thus resound in Polish President Lech Walesa's call to Bill Clinton 
to help "cage the Russian bear" by letting Poland into NATO now. German Angst 
about hordes of Russian or Ukrainian refugees swarming across newly open 
frontiers best explains why German political leaders are the first to champion 
the Poles' membership plea. 
</P>
<P>
 During late medieval times, when the Muslim sultans of Ottoman Turkey began to 
move northward into the Balkans and the Orthodox czars of Muscovite Russia 
westward across the steppes toward Warsaw, Catholics like the Poles, Hungarians 
and Croats perceived themselves as guardians upon the ramparts. To wealthy, 
comfortable and relatively safe Austrians, Germans and French, they depicted 
themselves as Catholic Christendom's bulwark against the Muslim and Orthodox 
East. 
</P>
<P>
 Poles, Czechs, Slovaks and Hungarians have seldom since the Middle Ages been 
completely accepted as part of the Catholic Christian West, however. That has 
been tragically true right down until recently. Walesa and Czech President 
Vaclav Havel play upon the West's historical guilt when they remind Paris, 
London and Washington that at least twice in this century, at Munich in 1938 
and at Yalta in 1945, the West sold them out. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Germany's most foresighted political leaders argues privately that 
post-Cold War Europe must group only those countries that experienced the 
Renaissance, Reformation, Counter-Reformation and Enlightenment -- none of 
which, of course, put a stamp on Russia or Islam. Such deep-seated cultural 
attitudes among elites explain better than any strategic rationale why Western 
Europeans have tended until now to close their eyes to the slaughter of Muslim 
Bosnians and why they shudder at the U.S. Administration's idea of one day 
bringing Russia into NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 Overtly defining NATO's (or the EU's) identity in cultural terms immediately 
raises many nasty foreign-policy problems. How, for example, do you justify 
excluding Catholic Lithuania or Croatia? Protestant Latvia or Estonia? Nobody 
will define that identity openly in such terms. But it remains below the 
surface the determinative factor nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite apart from insoluble foreign-policy problems, the United States, where 
openness, diversity and multiculturalism are prized, needs to challenge its 
Western European allies about the long-term wisdom of excluding countries whose 
historical traditions differ from those of Western Europe. American policies of 
inclusion, rather than European ones of exclusion, may be right for modern 
Europe, not only strategically but culturally as well.

GEORGE RAMOS: EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; REMEMBERING A VOW -- AND A 
BIRTHDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two things forced Jorge Gonzales Molina to suddenly get to know his neighbors: 
a 6.6 earthquake, and his wife's fear of it. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a single guy in Mexico City in 1985 when an 8.1 earthquake there killed 
25,000 people. He went to work at an auto repair shop after that quake, knowing 
he didn't have to calm anyone down or help anyone out. 
</P>
<P>
 But now he's a married guy in L.A., living in an apartment building where he 
knew no one. 
</P>
<P>
 So when last Monday's quake hit, that all changed. 
</P>
<P>
 I saw them arguing on the sidewalk outside of their Echo Park apartment 
building in the first hours after the quake. He wanted to go to work but she 
didn't want him to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please don't leave me here alone," wife Magdalena Maria pleaded. He replied 
that it was important to go to work, to earn some badly needed cash and to 
restore a sense of normalcy to the couple's lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that won't make any difference if we have no place to live," she 
insisted. "Please stay with me." He did. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I was struck by the conversation because a lot of Angelenos have been jolted 
into dealing with reality and each other. In scenes repeated from Northridge to 
Downtown, residents have been forced to get to know the person next door, often 
extending patience and courtesies that haven't been seen around this town for 
some time. 
</P>
<P>
 The drought didn't do that to us and neither did the floods, riots or fires. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 6.6er did, probably because it had a more widespread and disturbing 
effect on all of us. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm glad it did because we needed a wake-up call to take stock of ourselves 
and our place in L.A. I know I did. The normal routine of picking up shirts at 
the cleaners or visiting friends in Simi Valley isn't a sure thing anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 I suspect my friends out in the Westside, inconvenienced by the broken Santa 
Monica Freeway, will see the ethnically mixed Mid-City L.A. neighborhoods much 
differently, now that they have to drive through them. It's something that 
wouldn't have crossed their minds in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 It hit very close to home for me when everyone in my apartment building got 
together to celebrate a neighbor's birthday, an event that slipped by unnoticed 
last Monday in all of the chaos of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 After we cleaned up and threw out the damaged belongings that couldn't be 
salvaged, we got together to toast Monique on her special day. We laughed. We 
talked. We got to know each other. We felt good that we are neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 I found out that my next-door neighbors are from St. Louis, Mo., a fact I 
didn't know even though they'd been living in my building for more than a year. 
I then realized that Monique's birthday party was the first social gathering in 
which all of the building's tenants had attended in the 15 years I have lived 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 When I looked up Gonzales a few days later, he had made similar discoveries 
while helping his wife clean up the debris from the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent the free time that Monday getting to know his neighbors in his 
four-story apartment building. He had been too preoccupied to say anything more 
than "hello" when he encountered them in the past, but now appreciated the 
problems and joys of the daily route that Magdalena Maria, who works part time 
as a baby-sitter, follows. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he was horrified to learn how much time she has to spend to get 
to baby-sitting jobs near Downtown. He forgot that his wife doesn't drive and 
must rely on the generosity of friends or public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 He was helping to clean up the couple's one-bedroom apartment when he 
discovered a smashed photo of the couple's wedding day six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember what you told me that day?" Magdalena Maria asked. 
</P>
<P>
 When he mumbled that he couldn't remember everything he had said that day back 
home in the Mexican state of Mexico, she reminded him. 
</P>
<P>
 "You said our life together was more important than a job, or money," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her words cut him like a knife. "I remember saying those things," he admitted 
in a quiet moment. "How stupid of me to think making money was so important." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had thought about having a child but the husband dismissed the idea 
as too costly. A little one would bring unwanted changes to their lives, 
Gonzales had reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he thinks it's a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice to know," he said, "that my wife won't be alone if she has a 
child. She'll have me and the baby." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As I write this, another aftershock is rumbling through the area. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a little nervous about the shaking but I keep on typing. I know I'm not 
the only one who feels this way.

CLINTON TRIP, MOSCOW SUMMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to "Competing With Bobbitts and Ice Skaters, Summit Falls Short," 
news analysis by Thomas Rosenstiel, Jan. 15: 
</P>
<P>
 The headline that the "summit fell short," that there were no "enduring images 
that would capture a nation" is far from the truth, as witnessed via television 
coverage, and by your own Jan. 16 news analysis by Paul Richter and Doyle 
McManus, which states " . . . many of those scenes made strong images back home 
. . . Clinton consorting with Havel, hero of democracy and culture" and "in the 
Kremlin," etc. 
</P>
<P>
 On television, we witnessed the signing of a new agreement removing nuclear 
missiles from the Ukraine; President Clinton walking through a historic Jewish 
cemetery (a far cry from Bitburg); we saw him lighting a candle for his mother 
in a recently refurbished centuries-old Moscow church which the communists had 
turned into a public toilet (a photo you published, Jan. 14, without noting the 
historical context). And we saw meetings, an endless round of purposeful 
meetings with leaders of new and old countries, hour after hour, all happening 
immediately following the burial of President Clinton's mother, which the press 
seems to have already forgotten. 
</P>

 Rosenstiel complains that Clinton's aides don't have the media savvy that 
Ronald Reagan's did to create enduring images. That's OK. I like what Clinton 
is doing. And I could have done without some of the enduring images from the 
Reagan years like the Iran-Contra hearings; the HUD scandal; and a conveniently 
forgetful ex-President Reagan in a witness box.

 I was born a Republican, but now have begun to have an open mind about 
politics and the future of our beloved United States. So many political figures 
seem to be bigoted, narrow-minded and even cruel. This was very apparent during 
the death and funeral of President Clinton's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Our President's heart must have been heavier than usual, losing his beloved 
mother and facing the burden of the summit in Russia. But he went on with his 
duties with a stoical smile that endeared him to almost everyone. With the 
admirable job he did under stressful conditions, I think Clinton deserves high 
marks for his brilliant diplomatic astuteness.

 In the town hall meeting in Moscow (Jan. 15), President Clinton stated that he 
would not trade places with President Boris Yeltsin. I wish President Clinton 
every success as our chief executive, but he will probably not be another 
Washington or Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Washington, Yeltsin is the first president. Like Lincoln, Yeltsin for an 
awesome moment embodied "government by the people" as he stared down the 
fascists during the coup attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 President Yeltsin will be a watchword for democracy as long as it exists.

invite a Russian to this country to deal with our problems. What about shelter 
for the homeless? What about jobs for the millions out of work?

 I was reading my morning Times and the main stories were on President 
Clinton's recent successes in the former Soviet Union and Middle East. It 
appears to me that the President has done much in his first full year in 
office. He not only had Ukraine give up its nuclear arsenal (which is pointed 
at our country) but was also able to persuade Syria to commit to a peace treaty 
with Israel (Jan. 17). Last year, he passed the national budget in record time 
and got the health care debate off to a good start, as well as many other 
significant accomplishments. But back in Washington, waiting for our President 
to return from a historic trip, is Republican leader Bob Dole.  
</P>
<P>
 I, for one, do not care if Bill and Hillary Clinton had investments in a 
failed thrift. George Bush's son was a director of the failed Silverado Savings 
and Loan and nobody really cared about that. Furthermore, in the past 12 years, 
between the Reagan and Bush administrations, at least a dozen investigations 
took place, which included the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages scandal. And what 
happened to those presidents? Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 I care primarily about our national leaders' job performance, and if our 
President is competent enough to move our country out of this economic 
depression and keep me out of a war, then he has my support. Let the President 
govern and get our nation back on its feet, and Bob Dole, start being a 
constructive political leader.

THE ARROGANCE OF THOSE WHO KNOW SECRETS; INMAN: ACCESS TO INSIDE INFORMATION 
CAN CREATE DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR AND OMNISCIENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MILDRED G. GOLDBERGER, Mildred G. Goldberger was a contributor to the column 
Scientific View in the Los Angeles Times in the 1980s.

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Information is always better than ignorance." That was the explanation 
offered to me by academic friends who took assignments for American 
intelligence operations in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 The intelligence community, both ours and Britain's, learned during World War 
II how useful professors could be: mathematicians to break enemy codes and 
devise unbreakable codes for Our Side, practitioners of the "hard" sciences who 
could analyze collections of disparate bits of information, even medievalists 
to interpret hidden information in damaged documents. 
</P>
<P>
 But the CIA was never popular on campuses, even when its representatives 
appeared as recruiters, so those academics whose CIA connections were known 
found themselves pressed to explain that connection. Thanks to the student 
activism that ended the decade, the CIA lost much of its interest in the 
professoriate, and of course vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 But from those halcyon days I remember an augmentation of the hired academics 
different from the bank accounts enlarged by consulting fees. They displayed 
the kind of glee that accompanies knowing important secrets, whether on a 
playground or in the upper reaches of policy-making. And I remember, in even 
dear and trusted friends, the increase in arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing secrets is, in the current cliche, "empowering," no question about it. 
Knowledge is not only better than ignorance. It's more powerful. For those 
academics, even the mode in which they learned secrets added to their feelings 
of importance: passed through guarded entrances, listened to respectfully by 
people with swollen self-importance, made aware of their own distinction from 
their colleagues -- they would have to have been superhuman to avoid having 
swelled heads. But having a swelled head is just another name for arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
 To their credit, most of the academics co-opted by the intelligence community 
retired to the campuses where they were quickly cut down to size by colleagues 
with their own weapons of professional arrogance. And they came to view the use 
to which their skills had been put with some degree of skepticism as they 
readapted to campus life. They were like straying husbands happy to be welcomed 
back after extramarital affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 But intelligence is a much more impregnable ivory tower than academia ever 
could be. Paranoia -- delusions of grandeur and omniscience -- was a kind of 
occupational hazard for many of those whose careers lay there. Think of William 
Casey, the Irangate principal, and his leading disciple Oliver North. Think 
even of the otherwise sane members of the Reagan Cabinet who treated the 
members of Congress as their inferiors, unworthy of sharing the power of 
important secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 So Bobby Ray Inman's hallucinatory press conference should have come as no 
surprise. He was, after all, a card-carrying member of that elite corps, 
believing his knowledge of insider secrets put him above the rules that govern 
the lives of other people. For such a bred-in-the-bone believer, it would be 
unreasonable to submit to an examination of his career by those so clearly his 
inferiors. After all, how many of them would ever be entrusted with important 
secrets? 
</P>
<P>
 Whew! That was a narrow escape!

OPERA REVIEW; INTIMACY WITHOUT PASSION IN S.D. 'ONEGIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lurid ads are popular with opera companies these days. Impresarios everywhere 
-- well, almost everywhere -- have decided that Hollywood hype is useful when 
it comes to selling the lyric muse to the unwashed masses. 
</P>
<P>
 The blurb for "Yevgeny Onegin," which opened the belated San Diego Opera 
season on Saturday, was interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 "From Russia With Love," it blared, "and Betrayal and Jealousy and Death." 
</P>
<P>
 Socko. Wacko. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, as a perverse fate would have it, there was more passion in the 
pitch than in the performance. Hardly anyone at the Civic Theatre seemed to get 
very excited about the inherent emotional traumas. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems began in the rather scraggly pit, where Kenneth Montgomery, the 
Irish conductor from Amsterdam, seemed intent on evading storms at all cost. He 
obviously valued grace and sentiment, and he wasn't afraid to slow things down 
nearly to the stalling point whenever maximum introspection loomed. But he did 
little to accommodate, much less propel, the seething, throbbing, thrashing 
pathos with which Tchaikovsky delineated Pushkin's drama. 
</P>
<P>
 This might not have mattered too much if the stage had been populated with a 
cast of singing-actors who could muster turbulence on their own. But Ian 
Campbell had assembled a rather placid crew for this revival of the Canadian 
production first seen here in 1985. Compounding the expressive alienation, he 
had the mostly Anglo-Saxon cast dutifully mouth phonetic Russian while the 
audience dutifully followed a translation screened atop the proscenium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Onegin" had been a gripping theatrical experience eight years ago. Now it was 
just a nice concert with pretty costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 One artist managed to suggest what might have been. Hans Peter Blochwitz 
offered a sensitively detailed, overwhelmingly poignant portrait of the poet 
Lenski. 
</P>
<P>
 Courtly, bookish and eminently vulnerable, the German tenor looked pretty much 
like the impetuous 19-year-old described in the libretto, and he sang the 
reflective passages with bel-canto tones worthy of Mozart. It will be difficult 
to forget the choked pianissimo phrases with which he launched the great 
second-act ensemble, or the stunned resignation with which he defined his 
farewell to life in "Kuda, vi udalilis." 
</P>
<P>
 Nature did not endow Blochwitz with much thunder for the heroic outbursts. He 
refused to force for impact, however, and thus managed to make a dramatic 
virtue of vocal frailty. One could believe his desperation as well as his 
ardor. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Black was undertaking the title role for the first time. The hulking 
Australian baritone sang very well when the line didn't rise above his comfort 
level, and he made a conscientious effort to convey the drastic change in 
Onegin's character after the fatal duel with Lenski. He succumbed to 
exaggeration, however, making the St. Petersburg dandy an insufferable prig in 
the early scenes (how could Tatiana love this man?) and a slobbering fool in 
the later episodes. 
</P>
<P>
 Renee Fleming, one of the few bright prospects in the new generation of spinto 
sopranos, sang Tatiana's music with radiant tone, ample thrust and, in the last 
act, exquisite shading. But she did little to suggest the heroine's romantic 
torture, or to differentiate adolescent longing from mature renunciation. In 
other words, she couldn't compete with memories of Kathryn Bouleyn (a.k.a 
Kathryn Day), who left her unique imprint on the role in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Hegierski, more a mezzo-soprano than the contralto required by the 
composer, returned as a properly pretty, properly flighty Olga. Stefan 
Szkafarowsky conveyed little noble dignity in Prince Gremin's wonderful aria, 
but his rough-edged basso coped impressively with the range extremes. Douglas 
Perry waved a Pavarotti hankie (it's time to lay that easy cliche to rest) as 
an all-too prissy Triquet; at least he avoided caricature in his singing of the 
old pedant's sad little aria. The maternal duties were pleasantly dispatched by 
Martha Jane Howe (Mme. Larina) and Debria Brown (Filipievna). 
</P>
<P>
 John Copley's well-focused staging scheme, devised for Festival Ottawa in 
1983, remains a model of narrative intimacy. The same can be said for Robin 
Don's lightly stylized sets -- up to but not including the tacky St. Petersburg 
palace. The visual illusions were compromised by a series of lighting mishaps 
on this occasion, and Terry Gilbert's mock-Russian choreography looked better 
in Larina's country than in Gremin's city. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis Rizzo's supertitles actually respected and reflected the stresses of 
the Russian text. Still, "Onegin" in English would have made better sense on 
both sides of the proscenium.

 'Philadelphia' Edges 'Mrs. Doubtfire': It was neck-and-neck at the nation's 
box office during the weekend: TriStar's "Philadelphia" was barely beating 20th 
Century Fox's "Mrs. Doubtfire" for the No. 1 spot. Both movies took in about 
$9.1 million, with "Philadelphia" ahead by only a few thousand dollars, 
according to early industry estimates. "Philadelphia," featuring Tom Hanks in 
his Golden Globe-winning performance, was first for the second weekend in a 
row. No. 3 was Paramount's "Intersection," with $8.2 million its opening 
weekend despite negative reviews. Next, Warner Bros.' "Grumpy Old Men" with 
$6.1 million, followed by Disney's "Iron Will" with $4.1 million. Universal's 
"Schindler's List" was seventh with $3.4 million on just 343 screens. Industry 
sources said box-office business was better than expected considering the shaky 
ground in Los Angeles and the winter storm in the East. TELEVISION

 Dole on 'SNL'?: Sen. Bob Dole would love to do "Saturday Night Live." As long 
as he wouldn't have to do Wednesday, Thursday and Friday nights too. The Senate 
minority leader said he can't spare the four days needed to rehearse the NBC 
show. Dole said he has told "SNL" producer Lorne Michaels that he would be 
willing to make a cameo appearance, but Michaels is angling to get Dole as a 
guest host. In either case, Dole said he'd have to know what kind of skits were 
planned before he accepted.

 NBC Attacks Violence: Viewers will get to talk back to NBC News this week 
during its weeklong examination of violence in American society. The theme, 
"America the Violent: Fed Up and Fighting Back," will involve all news 
programs, including "News at Sunrise" through "Today," "Nightly News," 
"Dateline NBC" and "Now With Tom Brokaw and Katie Couric," and will feature 
anti-violence themes on prime-time programs such as "Empty Nest" and "Law & 
Order." Each weekday's coverage is organized around a daily issue. Today's is 
"Should we legalize drugs?" Other issues involve juvenile crime, media 
violence, guns and parole. Viewers can join in the debate via a 900 telephone 
number, a "fax hot line" and an Internet computer billboard. QUAKE NOTES

 Notes From TV-Land: The CBS series "Second Chances" isn't taking any chances. 
The show, which features Connie Sellecca, shut down production Friday because 
of extensive earthquake damage to its Valencia production facility. The show's 
producers are shopping around for a new venue. Episodes that have already been 
filmed are scheduled for Thursday and Feb. 3. A spokeswoman said she hopes it 
will be back on the air by summer. . . . Tom and Roseanne Arnold have donated 
$10,000 to the American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund to help earthquake 
victims. . . . Spanish-language TV station KVEA Channel 52 helped serve more 
than 1,000 hot meals to earthquake victims in the Pico-Union area last week.

 Which Shake, L.A?: "Which Way, L.A.?" KCRW's (89.9 FM) radio show that was 
born after the L.A. riots, is now confronting the earthquake. This week the 
show will address earthquake-related topics such as today's "Two Earthquakes: 
Past and Present," which will compare last week's quake experience to the 1971 
Sylmar quake and "Alternative Transportation" on Tuesday, which looks at how to 
get around without the usual freeway routes. On Wednesday, the show offers a 
report card on the delivery of housing, food and water to quake victims and on 
Thursday, how small businesses are handling the quake. The show airs at 1 p.m. 
and again at 7 p.m. MUSIC

MACPHERSON'S RENDITION OF AFRICAN POP MUSIC HITS PLENTY OF HIGH NOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill MacPherson is a long-haired, red-headed guitarist of Scottish descent who 
looks something like a young Van Morrison. So it seems a bit incongruous that 
MacPherson leads a band that concentrates on the African pop music form from 
Zaire known as Soukous. 
</P>
<P>
 But follow the twisted path of MacPherson's life and everything suddenly makes 
sense. The son of missionaries, he spent his teen-age years in Zaire, soaking 
up its sounds and rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, he moved to San Diego, where he picked up the guitar. Then it was 
on to Boston's Berklee School of Music to earn a degree, then back to San Diego 
where, as a graduate student, he rediscovered the music of Zaire. Saturday 
night he and his five-piece backing band, Third Beat, could be found at 
Randell's. 
</P>
<P>
 As you might expect, percussion plays a central role in MacPherson's music. 
Besides a drummer, a conga-player and a percussionist who focuses on African 
drums, the group's keyboard player, Chris Jones, serves as a percussive foil, 
especially in accompaniment. And the band's bassist, Nee Sackey who hails from 
Ghana, has a firm grip on the beat, pounding out his own thumb-driven rhythms 
on his electric's strings.  
</P>
<P>
 The resulting rhythmic layer cake makes a substantial base that MacPherson 
frosts with his own sweet-toned guitar lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's opening number "Kwilu," named for the Zairian river, built on a 
four-beat shuffle that suggested the Nigerian Ju-Ju form popularized by King 
Sunny Ade. Above this heated tempo, MacPherson suspended guitar lines that 
recalled early Pat Metheny in their construction and tonal quality. 
</P>
<P>
 His solo built quickly to a dynamic peak, then stayed there, matching 
intertwined lines with chordal strums. Then the beat suspended as drummer 
Michael Evans and bassist Sackey spaced their insistent beat with silence, 
building a bridge back to the theme. 
</P>
<P>
 That MacPherson's sound is a hybrid was apparent from the mix of styles 
presented in the hourlong set. Sackey's "Purple Flower" was a mid-tempo funk 
piece to which MacPherson applied harder-edged tones and temperament. The 
guitarist switched to a nylon-stringed acoustic instrument for the samba-like 
feel of his "A Cool Warmth," delivering warm statements that were accented by 
percussionist Jason Hann's talking drum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shakin' It Out," dedicated to the recent quake that made a mess of 
MacPherson's Sherman Oaks home, opened with a danceable African figure, but 
soon developed a tightly formed groove that allowed keyboardist Jones to soar. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones shone throughout the set, using acoustic tones from his synthesizer to 
serve up Herbie Hancock-inspired runs and chordal play. Improvising with 
bell-like electric sounds, his playing became more rhythmic as he splashed 
note-combinations against Sackey's bass riff and the band's wall of percussion. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, there were plenty of breaks where the percussionists took 
total control, usually led by Hann on the djembe drum cradled between his 
knees. These forays between percussionists took on the form of conversations 
with one drummer taking the lead as the other two rattled behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Though there were times that music might have been more tightly constructed, 
especially at points of change, its overall feel was one of groove and 
variation, with finely spun guitar lines strung over a tense, rhythmic 
framework.  
</P>
<P>
 MacPherson has found an appropriate direction to pursue, one that speaks to 
his personal history as well as the shrinking face of the musical world. Third 
Beat is the kind of cross-cultural musical exploration that celebrates the 
similarities and the differences between our planet's inhabitants.

THEATER; 'MAZE PLAYS' AN IRRESISTIBLE, MAGICAL CHILDREN'S WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ah, the magical, mystical world of childhood -- a world long on surprises, 
wonder and imagination. A world where you don't have to belabor how Sea Witches 
can steal voices ("The Little Mermaid"), people can disappear for years in a 
hot-air balloon ("The Wizard of Oz") and a girl and her dog can save the day 
from the forces of evil ("Annie"). 
</P>
<P>
 In the American premiere of the irresistible "Mr. A's Amazing Maze Plays" at 
the Old Globe's Cassius Carter Centre Stage, British playwright Alan Ayckbourn 
proves himself marvelously adept at tapping into that world -- with an original 
and modern twist. 
</P>
<P>
 When his young heroine, Suzy, wends her way into the home of the evil Mr. 
Accousticus -- who steals voices -- the audience decides by a show of hands 
whether she goes down the hallway or through a door, whether she goes to "the 
red room" or further down the hall, whether she goes through a small concealed 
door or opens French windows to reveal a jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to a brave new interactive age in which the audience must help their 
heroine save the day. Welcome to the suspense of wondering if the actors can 
truly master the 26 possible locations the devilishly clever Ayckbourn has 
written into a children's play that is definitely not child's play. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayckbourn, whose prolific and funny pen has earned him the sobriquet of the 
British Neil Simon, has never previously been a happily-ever-after sort of 
playwright. Most of his 47 works gleam with acidic details of adult betrayals 
and peccadilloes. But, here, the master of the difficult puzzle play for adults 
fools us again by entering the innocent world of a child with complete, 
unabashed good humor and good will. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, pigtailed Suzy (Jennifer Hugus) is just the bright, stalwart and 
stubborn young English heroine you can trust to solve the mysteries of "The 
Secret Garden" or "Alice in Wonderland." Ever since her father (Steve Jones) 
disappeared in a hot-air balloon, she has been a comfort to her lovable but 
dizzy mother (Lynne Griffin) and her dog Neville (whom we see grow up from a 
bit of barking fur to actor Sean Sullivan in a dog suit). 
</P>
<P>
 Then Mr. Accousticus (Jonathan McMurtry) moves into the large, mysterious 
house across the street, and people, dogs and birds start losing their voices. 
Suzy realizes immediately that something is not right about this oily-voiced 
man in the dark, handsome suit, but will she be able to persuade her mother 
before Mr. Accousticus literally charms the words right out of their mouths? 
</P>
<P>
 In the world of magic -- as any wise child knows -- all ingredients must be 
just so, from eye of newt to head of toad. Under the exquisitely detailed 
direction of Old Globe executive producer Craig Noel, every ingredient is 
precisely right, from Greg Lucas' spookily suggestive set to the impeccable 
casting. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugus' self-possessed Suzy anchors the play, much of which is told in 
alternating narration by the dryly funny Ralph Elias and the exuberantly warm 
Katherine McGrath at opposite stair exits from the theater in the round. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynne Griffin plays the daffy mother to sweet perfection while Richard Easton 
sloshes delicately around as Suzy's friend, the chronically inebriated Mr. 
Passerby. McMurtry's unctuous delivery as Mr. Accousticus conjures up a likely 
devil, and Sullivan's Neville, the ultimate scene-stealing dog, is a marvel of 
mop threads masquerading as fur, a whitened face with a funny nose mask, 
prancing and rolling on all fours, snuffling and barking and needing nary a 
word to tell his every thought. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lucas' stark but suggestive set, hot-air balloons rise and descend, smoke 
and light billow up through loose blue-gray flagstones, and cobwebs hang from 
chandeliers borrowed from Miss Havisham's stock. Clare Henkel's elegant English 
costumes, largely in black and white, summon us back to the world of old 
movies. Michael Gilliam's lighting deepens the mystery and the all-important 
sound design of Jeff Ladman hits a rousing climax when Suzy and Neville 
discover the cabinet where Mr. Accousticus files all his stolen voices and 
noises right down to burglar alarms and toilets flushing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. A's Amazing Maze Plays" debuted at Ayckbourn's own Stephen Joseph Theatre 
(also a theater in the round) in Scarborough in 1988 and opened at London's 
National Theatre last March. Since then, Ayckbourn has written five more 
scripts for children and adults who have not lost the child in them. 
</P>
<P>
 In a world that can never have too much wonder and goodwill, here's looking 
forward to the next of Mr. Ayckbourn's amazing maze plays. 
</P>

OPERA; UNMERRY 'WIDOW' IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Opera Pacific, official guardian of theatrical music at the costly, glamorous 
and presumably sophisticated Orange County Performing Arts Center, declared 
bankruptcy Friday night. Artistic bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 The opus on display was Franz Lehar's lovely old Viennese operetta, "The Merry 
Widow." It isn't exactly a heady or risky choice for a company that can only 
muster four productions in a year. Nevertheless, one can make a case for its 
place in the repertory if it is given a classy production -- that is, a 
production elevated by style, wit, charm and big-league voices. 
</P>
<P>
 Style, wit and charm? Big-league voices? Forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 Opera Pacific seemed steadfastly intent on ignoring Lehar's essential, 
admittedly dated elegance. The company hijacked the fragile 88-year-old vehicle 
and took it on a camping trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The creaky plot -- rather loosely translated and "adapted" by Ted and Deena 
Puffer -- became an exercise in silly banality. Dorothy Danner, listed as 
director as well as choreographer, encouraged her cast of has-beens and 
would-be's to do little but indulge in nonstop mugging, leering and prancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell Krieger, the resident maestro, enforced mechanical brio without much 
concern for the insinuating lilt, and, when it came to three-quarter time, he 
trampled the hesitant beat. He proved one thing in the process: how hard it is 
to waltz in a straitjacket. 
</P>
<P>
 Subtlety went a-slumming, and this "Widow" turned out to be anything but 
merry. All night long, one longed for champagne. The waiters kept serving 
cornballs. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this was, to put it kindly, disappointing. Still, it need not have been 
offensive. We have endured leaden Lehar in better places. But David DiChiera, 
the genial general director of Opera Pacific, added an ultimate musical insult 
to idiomatic injury. He enlisted a "sound designer," Abe Jacob, to turn on the 
infernal microphones. 
</P>
<P>
 It is bad enough that we have to endure amplified noise in place of bona-fide 
music these days in so-called musical comedies. But Lehar isn't Lloyd Webber 
(thank goodness). One would like to think that operatic voices don't need 
dishonest reinforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 From a good seat half-way back on the lower level of Segerstrom Hall, the 
score sounded as if it were being piped in from Albania on a bad shortwave 
radio. The volume was loud, the distortion louder. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the circumstances, one had a hard time assessing the singing. Certain 
truths, however, remained self-evident. 
</P>
<P>
 For the title role -- the young merry-maker widowed after an 8-day marriage -- 
DiChiera engaged Roberta Peters. She owned the only famous name in the program, 
and, after a career that has spanned more than four decades, she proved that 
she still can sing beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
 She brought a pretty shimmer and some startling atmospheric ascents to the 
long lines of the "Vilja" song. Like many a star before her, she capitalized on 
the third-act interpolation of "Meine Lippen sie kussen so heiss," a finesse 
aria Lehar wrote 29 years later for Jarmila Novotna in "Giuditta." 
</P>
<P>
 Peters continues to exude a certain pert glamour, and she musters professional 
aplomb for even the tawdriest of cliches. It would be less than realistic, 
however, to pretend that the passage of time has left no mark on her, or that 
she was perfectly cast as the seductive Hanna Glawari. For all her enlightened 
diligence, she seemed more a superannuated soubrette than ageless diva, and her 
relatively modern costumes clashed with the Jugendstil creations designed for 
the other women on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The most striking features of her dapper Danilo, Ron Raines, turned out to be 
a good voice and a bad wig. The duties of the incipient juvenile lovers were 
robustly dispatched by Robin Follman (the ingenue Valencienne) and Fred Love 
(the tenorino Camille). 
</P>
<P>
 The gaggle of would-be comedians was led with shameless bravado by Marshall 
Borden, voiceless and fatuous beyond the norm as Baron Zeta. Tony Tanner 
attended knowingly to the expanded routines of his deadpan 
servant-for-all-reasons, Njegus. 
</P>
<P>
 The various chorus liners sang, bounced, kicked, posed and executed cancan 
splits, as needed, with diligent frenzy. Gotta dance, dance, dance. Gotta sell, 
sell, sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Zack Brown's lavishly literal storybook sets looked nice. Unfortunately, they 
couldn't sing.

ASHKENAZY CONDUCTS SHOSTAKOVICH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For his only local conducting appearances this season, Vladimir Ashkenazy 
chose a satisfying program to lead the Los Angeles Philharmonic through. It 
combined William Kraft's bright, very short Fanfare, Brahms' "Tragic" Overture, 
Mozart's G-major Violin Concerto and Shostakovich's Tenth Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 And satisfying it was in all ways, Friday night in the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion of the Music Center. Well received, too: Not only did the audience 
refrain from coughing during most of the playing, it also cheered loudly at 
appropriate points. 
</P>
<P>
 Shostakovich's deep-boned Tenth provided the climax to these proceedings, yet 
its pleasures were spread out. 
</P>
<P>
 Kraft's Fanfare -- the second of a dozen new pieces noting the Philharmonic's 
75th anniversary -- prevented early dozing in the most positive way. Quartets 
of trumpets, horns, trombones and percussionists, plus one tuba, exclaimed six 
important-sounding musical sentences in what the Philharmonic's resident 
archivist reported to be 53 seconds. This was not the first time that Kraft's 
music has made us smile; we believe it will not be the last. 
</P>
<P>
 Brahms' nominally "Tragic" overture had the same effect, and justifiably. One 
does not always hear this composer's music laid out so persuasively in 
structure, or transparently in texture. 
</P>
<P>
 Making her third Southern California appearance in the 1990s, young Antje 
Weithaas, a young German violinist of high accomplishment and resourceful 
virtuosity, gave a graceful, loving and pointed reading to Mozart's K. 216 
Concerto. In this she was assisted carefully by conductor Ashkenazy and a 
reduced Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 Following intermission, the Russian-born maestro led Shostakovich's sometimes 
grim Tenth with an apprehensible sense of purpose and clear emotional 
definitions. The orchestra responded deftly, providing the full dynamic 
spectrum called-for by the composer and the contagious motivation demanded by 
the conductor. Without slighting either the lyrical peaks or the aggressive 
climaxes along the way, Ashkenazy let the structure build to its final 
statements in a convincing ascent of feeling. That, of course, is what 
conductors are supposed to do.

SOUTHWEST CHAMBER PLAYS EARLY CARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Elliott Carter. The mere mention of the name strikes dread into the ears of 
some listeners, complete, enthusiastic admiration into others.Probably no other 
living composer can boast such a disparate range of reaction, with very little 
in between. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreaders and admirers alike could come together for the latest of several 
recent local Carter tributes, put on Saturday at Pasadena Presbyterian Church 
(repeated Sunday at Chapman University in Orange) by the Southwest Chamber 
Music Society. That's because the tribute concentrated solely on the early, 
relatively approachable works of the 85-year-old composer, who was in 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the First String Quartet (1951) is an easy thing, but it is when 
compared with some of the later music. As the initial step on the composer's 
road to aggressive complexity, this quartet retains an immediacy of impact that 
the later work doesn't always have. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southwest String Quartet -- Peter Marsh and Annie Chalex, violins, Jan 
Karlin, viola, Roger Lebow, cello -- exposed its many layers clearly and 
brought it to dramatic heights convincingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, soprano Phyllis Bryn-Julson and pianist Leonard Stein had offered 
Carter songs from 1943: "Three Poems of Robert Frost," "Voyage" and "A Warble 
for Lilac Time," all written in an American neo-classical vein. Though 
Bryn-Julson was not in her best voice, she and Stein communicated this rugged, 
rhapsodic music with assurance. TIMOTHY MANGAN

GOLDBERG REVIVES WHITE BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 30 years ago the likes of Paul Butterfield and Mike Bloomfield built a 
rock-solid brand of blues that served not only as a bridge between blues 
purists and young rockers, but also as an essential step between the "real" 
blues of Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf and the later mutations of Cream, 
Hendrix and Led Zeppelin. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago-born organist Barry Goldberg, a key figure in the '60s white blues 
explosion, brought that missing link back to life in a three-day stint over the 
weekend at the Genghis Cantina. Saturday's show was a virtual clinic in 
blues-rock basics. 
</P>
<P>
 The rhythms of bassist Mark Goldberg (no relation) and especially drummer Gary 
Mallaber swung mightily, while guitarist Matt Sherman and harmonica player and 
singer Stanley Behren, like their leader, displayed impressive instrumental 
skills without gratuitous flash. Guest turns from veteran English vocalist 
Terry Reid and American guitarist Harvey Mandel hinted at where this music 
ultimately led -- Zeppelin-esque sweep and pyrotechnic fusion, respectively.  
</P>
<P>
 But it was the solid foundations of the band that stood out. Even after 
decades of stretching and innovation from Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan, et 
al., the key elements of blues-rock remain exactly what Goldberg and crew 
offered in large supply: depth of knowledge, feeling and -- most importantly -- 
love of the music. STEVE HOCHMAN

EAST L.A. BLAZERS GO BEYOND CLASSIC R&B 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Blazers hail from L.A.'s Eastside, but their 90-minute set on Friday at 
the Palomino -- framed with Chuck Berry's "Down the Road Apiece" and "Bye Bye 
Johnny" -- firmly placed the quartet in the city's roots-rockin' bar-band camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Classic R&B is the foundation, but the Blazers incorporated healthy dollops of 
country, straight blues and rock 'n' roll.The group's Spanish-language material 
is largely built on the slinky cumbia rhythm, which snugly fit the R&B slant. 
"Short Fuse" and the country-guitar hook and ingratiating chorus of "Yeah, 
Yeah, Yeah" indicate they can fashion convincing originals. 
</P>
<P>
 The band revolves around Big Manuel Gonzales, an extremely dexterous, 
fleet-fingered guitarist -- he played a lot of notes, but they were marked by 
constant invention. Ruben Guaderrama complemented Gonzales with simple, melodic 
solos. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like another Los Lobos? Well, not yet anyway. The Blazers -- whose 
debut album, due next month, will be produced by Lobos' Cesar Rosas -- lack the 
musical range of their East L.A. forerunners, and neither Gonzales nor 
Guaderrama matches Rosas or David Hidalgo as singers. But within its narrower 
framework, the band's arranging smarts, energy and Gonzales' stature as a 
budding guitar hero bodes well for the future. DON SNOWDEN

ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH / SPECIAL REPORT: HEALTH CARE

<TEXT>
<P>
 TREND-SETTERS: For many Americans, health care reform will mean joining 
cost-saving health maintenance organizations. But Orange County residents are 
far ahead of other Americans in accepting HMOs.Experts are unsure why, but 
suggest that Southern Californians have long been conditioned to managed care. 
Kaiser Permanente, the nation's largest HMO, was founded in California, and 
Orange County is home to two major groups: PacifiCare Health Systems of Cypress 
and FHP International of Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 HEALTH CZAR: As the White House struggles with health care issues nationally, 
Orange County is starting to deal with its own concerns. . . . Mary Dewane, a 
Medicaid expert, recently was picked to head OPTIMA, the HMO-like program to 
provide health care for Orange County's poor. Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, 
who helped dream up OPTIMA, said the first hurdle is over, but expects more to 
come, including raising funds: "We'll certainly achieve our goal of being 
operational by 1995." 
</P>
<P>
 FAMILY PLAN: Laguna Hills dentist Bruce Glover is among a handful of dentists 
who recently signed on to a new dental plan designed by Santa Monica-based 
Dentnet Inc. Called the Modern Family plan, it acknowledges that an increasing 
number of families don't fall under the traditional definitions and offers 
benefits to gay and lesbian domestic partners, other unmarried couples, in-laws 
-- just about anyone who can prove they live under the same roof. "You just 
can't predict what families are supposed to look like these days," Glover said. 
"This really takes care of that issue." HMO Popularity

RIORDAN PRESENTS TRAFFIC PLAN; RADICAL CHANGE IN COMMUTING HABITS SOUGHT; 
DISASTER: OFFICIALS SAY QUICK FIXES WILL ALLOW ROADS TO ACCOMMODATE ABOUT 60% 
OF NORMAL FLOW. RIDE-SHARING, PARKING RESTRICTIONS AND NEW DETOURS ARE PART OF 
PACKAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan asked earthquake-shaken Angelenos on Sunday to radically 
change their commuting habits, and he presented the first formal plan designed 
to solve a transportation crisis that could dwarf the challenge faced during 
the 1984 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 The region's damaged freeways offer the strongest incentives for car-pooling 
since the Summer Games, when 5.5 million visitors and spectators inundated the 
city. The quake plan will offer special advantages of faster, easier commutes 
to motorists who share rides. It will also restrict on-street parking to ease 
traffic flow. And officials said they will ask local businesses -- as well as 
government agencies -- to alter the standard 9-to-5 workweek, as they did 
during the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monday morning will be a major strain on the transportation system," Riordan 
said. "While people might yearn for a so-called normal rush hour, we cannot 
expect it to resemble a rush hour in any way, shape or form." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with all the quick fixes, officials said the solutions that they can 
provide will only allow the region's roads and freeways to handle about 60% of 
the normal traffic. About 40 lanes of city streets would be necessary to make 
up for the collapsed, closed portions of the Santa Monica Freeway -- the 
busiest freeway in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, thousands remained homeless after nearly 11,000 dwelling units were 
declared uninhabitable as of Sunday. At Northridge Apartments, next door to the 
Northridge Meadows complex that collapsed, residents were allowed to return to 
their units and retrieve belongings for 15 minutes Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-nine Red Cross and Salvation Army shelters and five tent cities erected 
by the National Guard sheltered the displaced, while for the first time since 
the quake, a few lucky families began to move into new homes with the aid of 
federal vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Aftershocks Sunday renewed concerns about the safety of the Pacoima Dam and 
led to the evacuation of the shelter at San Fernando High School. The threat of 
rain dissipated Sunday, but forecasters said another storm was possible today 
that would snarl recovery plans. 
</P>
<P>
 In a news conference in City Hall, Riordan -- flanked by federal officials -- 
announced a blueprint for handling the region's congestion woes. Their plan has 
been in the works since the quake hit a week ago; Olympic traffic planning was 
three years in the making. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake plan includes: 
</P>
<P>
 * Opening a short detour for only car-pools and buses around the Santa Monica 
Freeway by using Robertson Boulevard, beginning Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Converting the two southbound truck lanes on the Antelope Valley Freeway to 
general use; one lane would be dedicated to car-pools and buses, and the other 
would be mixed flow. 
</P>
<P>
 * Opening a detour around Interstate 5 using Calgrove Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reopening Washington and Venice boulevards by sometime Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Activating the city's existing "smart corridor," a network of automatic 
traffic signals, to ease the flow of traffic along major east-west surface 
streets alongside the Santa Monica Freeway, such as Pico, Washington, Venice, 
and Adams boulevards. To make sure the traffic signals are regulating vehicles 
efficiently, the corridor area will be monitored by cameras installed in 
various locations and by helicopters flying during mornings and evenings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Building a special "bypass" roadway for westbound bus and car-pool traffic 
from Washington Boulevard to La Cienega Boulevard on Los Angeles Department of 
Water and Power property. That route will be built and opened within a week. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reopening the Simi Valley Freeway between the Golden State and San Diego 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 When alternate routes and lanes are reopened, Caltrans officials say, they 
will have few other options to offer -- short of reconstructing the damaged 
thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we do all that, I will have run out of tricks," said Jerry Baxter, head 
of the local Caltrans office. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6.6-magnitude quake that rocked the Los Angeles Basin last week pounded 
the region's freeways, collapsing bridges and shutting portions of six 
thoroughfares, including the San Diego, Golden State and Santa Monica freeways. 
On Sunday, Caltrans officials reopened the closed sections of Pacific Coast 
Highway. They will decide this week whether to build a temporary bridge to span 
the gap in the Santa Monica Freway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be the worst traffic nightmare in the history of the region," 
said Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. "People need to think of 
alternatives. . . . Otherwise, they are going to be frustrated sitting in 
veritable parking lots on the roads." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, with lighter-than-normal commuting, traffic has been backed up for 
hours and miles. Although today's traffic is expected to be close to normal, 
officials believe that Tuesday's will be the real headache, when schools 
reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation officials all pounded out the same drumbeat: Don't drive unless 
you must. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting the debris removed and beginning the rebuilding process is going to . 
. . take many, many months," said U.S. Secretary of Transportation Federico 
Pena. "So the question is, how do we deal with the immense challenge of 
improving mobility?" 
</P>
<P>
 Take the train, the bus, Pena urged. Share rides with other motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping that Angelenos will heed the message, Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority officials have increased the number of trains running and created 
more bus routes. They also extended the Metrolink commuter rail line another 50 
miles on old freight train tracks so trains can stop in Lancaster and Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews have been working 18-hour days to construct the two temporary train 
stations in Lancaster and Palmdale. The cities have spent more than $300,000 on 
the new platforms -- an amount officials hope will be reimbursed by the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 When traffic flowed smoothly during the 16 days of the 1984 Summer Olympics, 
transportation officials declared that they had accomplished a minor miracle. 
That feat, however, had consumed three years of intensive planning. 
</P>
<P>
 To handle the crunch of traffic, Olympic officials had carefully crafted a 
scheme that included converting streets into one-way thoroughfares, embedding 
traffic sensors in 200 miles of roads, installing remote-control traffic 
signals and ramp meters, getting employers to agree to a staggered workweek, 
and shifting truck deliveries to off-hours. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, transportation officials basically have only days to implement a plan 
they hope will be nearly as effective. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks ahead, officials will probably try out some of the features of 
the Olympics plan. Riordan is considering converting certain streets -- such as 
Pico and Olympic boulevards -- into one-way thoroughfares. He is also preparing 
to launch a campaign asking employers to alter the standard workweek so fewer 
motorists will brave freeways during rush hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Other aspects of the Olympics plan are more easily implemented. To ease the 
burden on city streets that are now accommodating hundreds more cars than 
normal, officials said they will reconfigure on-street parking and install 
multiple turn lanes at key detour intersections. 
</P>
<P>
 On other streets, the timing on traffic signals will be fine-tuned to allow a 
greater flow of cars. On Devonshire Street in Granada Hills, which is being 
used for traffic diverted from the Simi Valley Freeway, officials will set 
stricter parking restrictions to prevent cars from clogging the roadway during 
rush hour. They will also rejigger the timing on signals on the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Riordan's traffic management plan, crews will begin taking an inventory 
of the major damaged parking structures so that in some areas, on-street 
parking restrictions will be relaxed. In other areas, such as those near the 
damaged Warner Center, officials will install angle parking on selected 
streets. And to make sure every motorist heeds new parking restrictions, 
officials say they will propose raising fines for violations. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Hollywood news conference, Gov. Pete Wilson announced that he had signed 
an executive order allowing Caltrans to waive most of the standard construction 
requirements usually imposed by the state, so that the agency can expedite 
highway repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials, Wilson said, "have shaken hands with contractors who are 
already at work." The move, he said, should shave six months to a year off the 
time it will take to repair quake-damaged roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said he does not expect the corner-cutting to cut into the quality of 
repair work or the fairness of the bids. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're dealing with people who know what the costs are, who have a good 
reputation for (minority-owned and woman-owned firm) participation," Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with the expedited process, he said, repairs are expected to take a 
year or more. Last week, Caltrans officials vowed to have the freeways repaired 
in 12 months or less. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Caltrans crews set off explosives to help clean away the broken 
connector roads from the Antelope Valley Freeway to the Golden State Freeway.

 Rumors of an impending settlement have swirled around the case since Jan. 14, 
when lawyers for both sides met in chambers with Superior Court Judge David 
Rothman. Afterward, the judge said the attorneys had agreed to halt their 
public comments on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, a number of reports and courthouse rumors have suggested that a 
deal was in the works. A London tabloid reported last week that Jackson had 
agreed to pay at least $40 million to the boy, while Time magazine will report 
this week that the figure is closer to $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources told The Times that the deal is for "eight figures" -- somewhere 
between $10 million and $100 million -- but would not elaborate. Negotiations 
continue, they said, adding that talks have not revolved around the amount of 
the settlement but around other issues concerning resolution of the civil case. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry R. Feldman, the boy's lawyer, did not return phone calls Sunday. Howard 
Weitzman, a lawyer for Jackson, was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Motions in the case are scheduled to be heard Tuesday, and if a deal is not 
made by that time, the courtroom session will go ahead, sources said. On the 
other hand, if both sides resolve the lingering issues, the lawyers are 
expected to announce at that session that the case has been settled. They are 
not expected to disclose details of any settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Of particular interest to police, sheriff's deputies and prosecutors from Los 
Angeles and Santa Barbara counties is what effect a settlement might have on 
their criminal investigation into allegations that Jackson sexually molested 
the boy over a period of about four months last year. Investigators have 
interviewed dozens of witnesses -- including the alleged victim -- as part of 
that probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts said no written agreement could prevent the boy from testifying 
against Jackson in a criminal case. Drafting such an agreement could be 
construed as obstructing a criminal investigation and could be punishable under 
legal provisions that preclude anyone from "compounding a crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, under California law, minors can be and sometimes are required to 
testify against their will. The law includes an exception for adult or juvenile 
victims of sex crimes, however, so the boy in this case probably could not be 
forced to take the stand if he decided against it, legal experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as important as the law, however, is a practical question: If the boy 
were to refuse to testify in the criminal case, would prosecutors be willing to 
force him to the stand to press their case against Jackson? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a difficult call," said Harland Braun, an experienced criminal lawyer 
and former deputy district attorney. "There are two considerations here: You 
prosecute crimes partly for the victims, but also to protect the public." 
</P>
<P>
 For Jackson, ending the civil case would at the very least remove him from a 
proceeding that has damaged his career and, according to the entertainer and 
his advisers, taken a toll on his health. Jackson abruptly ended a world tour 
last year, claiming that the allegations and recent scalp surgery had caused 
him such stress that he became addicted to painkillers. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, one of Jackson's lawyers, Bertram Fields, said the singer was 
"barely able to function adequately on an intellectual level" and would require 
at least six to eight weeks of treatment at an undisclosed location overseas. 
Jackson returned to the country four weeks later and publicly proclaimed his 
innocence in a nationally televised statement from his Los Olivos ranch, known 
as Neverland. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, the legal pressure against Jackson has mounted, as the boy's 
lawyer has pressed the civil case on several fronts. On Jan. 10, Feldman filed 
a motion seeking access to Jackson's financial records, and he attached to that 
motion a number of excerpts from depositions taken as part of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 In those depositions, a former maid for Jackson spelled out what she said were 
several instances in which she saw the entertainer naked with young boys. Other 
employees and former employees described a security system that alerted Jackson 
whenever someone approached his bedroom, and one former secretary acknowledged 
that she told police Jackson was a pedophile, though she added that she 
regretted and disavowed those comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Jackson's lawyers had sought to prevent release of the depositions to 
the public or prosecutors, Rothman overruled that motion. As a result, the 
information learned in the civil case is available to prosecutors considering 
whether to bring criminal charges.

RENTER WHO MOVED BEFORE QUAKE HAUNTED BY SURVIVAL 
</P>

<P>
 It was a New Year's resolution that saved Terry Gosier. Nothing grand, like a 
midlife career change or a move to Montana, but something simple: saving money. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 1, just 16 days before the 6.6 earthquake, the nurse and graduate 
student moved out of her home in the Northridge Meadows apartments and into 
cheaper student housing on the other side of the Cal State Northridge campus. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4:31 a.m. last Monday, Terry Gosier's former home, Apt. 238, was destroyed. 
Where her bed once stood there is now a gaping hole. Ceilings are waist high. 
The second-floor apartment is now on the first floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The mile move has saved $265 a month on rent and utilities -- and perhaps her 
life. "I feel like the luckiest woman on the planet, the most blessed person in 
the universe," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Gosier, 36, is the Northridge earthquake's equivalent to the traveler 
who got off the plane before the crash, the investor who pulled out of the 
stock market before the 508-point plunge -- in society's eyes part psychic, 
part cheat. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when Southern Californians are surrounded by destruction, stunned by 
death, Gosier's story still has the power to chill: Sixteen neighbors died in a 
building she had just left. And it is just this view that gives her the 
greatest pain, brings tears to her eyes: Terry as Talisman, Good-Luck Gosier, 
The Woman Who Cheated Death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sort of guilty for surviving," she said quietly as she sat in her 
campus apartment, surrounded by broken glass. "I feel like I'm really dead, in 
heaven -- I believe in heaven and hell -- and I have some sort of special gift 
to come back to Earth after the quake, see what it's like and then be snatched 
back. I don't feel like I'm really here. I feel so guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 There is plenty of precedent to Gosier's tale: the lack of seat space that 
took guitarist Tommy Allsup and future country music star Waylon Jennings off a 
small chartered plane that crashed in Iowa, killing rock stars Buddy Holly, 
Ritchie Valens and J. P. (The Big Bopper) Richardson in 1959; the illness that 
caused In-N-Out Burger co-founder Esther Snyder to disembark last month from a 
chartered plane that later crashed at a Santa Ana auto mall, killing her son 
and several others. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is a name for what Gosier is living through now, as the battered San 
Fernando Valley digs out from the massive earthquake: survivor's guilt, that 
most bittersweet of ailments. To suffer from it is to be alive and have a 
heart. Not to suffer from it is a very scary thought indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The important part of it is the humbling part of it, to realize how fragile 
life is," said psychologist Lilli Friedland, a member of the Los Angeles County 
Psychological Assn.'s disaster response team. "Just like in life, a little bit 
of guilt is good. It reminds us of how thankful we need to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Gosier needs little reminder. 
</P>
<P>
 Sleeping in her cinder-block campus apartment Monday morning, Gosier was 
awakened by a flying mirror that hit her on the back of the head. Stepping out 
of bed in the dark, pitching room, she put her foot through a small television 
set, gashing her shin. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her neighbors were herded across Zelzah Avenue to spend a chilly hour 
on a CSUN soccer field. When dawn broke and she heard of the damage at the 
Northridge Meadows, where Apt. 238 remained vacant, she raced across campus. 
The force of the quake had shoved the top floors downward, reducing the first 
floor to a heap of rubble a foot high. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was down," she said. "And I couldn't believe it. I almost fainted. Some of 
the ambulances were taking bodies away. They were still pulling people out. We 
were still having tremors. You could see the building settle. It was terrible, 
terrible. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of elderly people in the building. I'm a nurse. If I still 
lived there I could have helped them." And her voice trails off. 
</P>
<P>
 Her Rollerblades and the abundant, twisting walkways at Northridge Meadows 
apartments allowed her to meet most of her neighbors, know them at least by 
sight, many of them much better than that. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, as she fingered a list of the people who died in the quake, she 
murmured their names and remembered: Manuel D. Sandoval, 24. Cecilia Pressman, 
72. Myrna Velasquez, 18, "the most beautiful girl. She's one of those Chanel 
girls, every hair in place, pearls and pearl earrings even when she wore sweats 
and did laundry." 
</P>
<P>
 Her finger goes down the list and stops at Adam Slotnik, 27, recently 
transferred from the East Coast to manage a restaurant in Northridge. They'd 
bowl together on occasion, he was going to buy her sofa when she moved out, his 
life was falling perfectly into place. 
</P>
<P>
 "He bragged that he was going to retire before age 30," she recalled. "He had 
all these stocks and bonds. He'd say, 'I won't have to worry about anything 
when I'm 30.' He sure won't." 
</P>
<P>
 They are gone. She is not. And everywhere she goes, everyone who knows her 
tale looks at her just a little differently these days. They ask her questions 
as if she foresaw what happened. She insists, over and over, that she did not. 
She just wanted to save some money, pay her tuition at CSUN, get the 
prerequisite courses done and head for a Ph.D. program at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 She does, however, trust her judgment more these days. She has learned to be 
prepared, keeping a packed bag near her apartment door, showering with her keys 
in her teeth. The other changes are more of a mixed bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a week after the quake she was still sleeping in her Jeep, couldn't 
stand the thought of being in a building for more than an hour. By Friday, her 
flu had blossomed into pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
 She is plagued by a nagging feeling of doom, that her luck has run out, that 
the next time "it'll be me," that she's "used up all my tickets on luck." But 
even that pain comes and goes, threaded through, as it is, with sweet relief 
and a feeling that something good must come of all this. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lost so much in my life: my parents, my brother, two marriages that 
failed. It's just hard," she said. "Before the quake that's why I stayed by 
myself. I didn't think anyone had lost as much as I did. . . . But now 
everybody talks to everybody. I'm going to be a much nicer person."

HOURS OF TERROR IN THE RUBBLE, DUST; QUAKE: AT COLLAPSED APARTMENT, MANY WERE

LOVED ONE.

<P>
 Editor's note: Last Monday's quake devastated the Los Angeles area, but the 
human toll was heaviest at a Northridge apartment complex that collapsed, 
killing 16. The survivors rescued, comforted and consoled each other for almost 
an hour before help came. This is their story.  
</P>
<P>
 Steve Langdon rolled over at 4:30 a.m., eyed the clock groggily and pulled 
himself out of bed, half an hour earlier than usual, but ready to brew some 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 Three doors down the hall in Apt. 101, mechanic Pil Soon Lee was already up, 
quietly brushing his teeth to avoid waking his wife and their two sons. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the northern alleyway of the Northridge Meadows apartment complex, Cary 
Erdman guided his car slowly toward the electronic security gate, heading to 
his supermarket job in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as 4:31 popped up on clock radios throughout the building, daily 
routines came crashing down with a roar -- along with the walls, stairways, 
floors and ceilings of a typical beige stucco San Fernando Valley apartment 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Erdman, 49, watched in the yellow glare of his headlights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in the car shaking," said Erdman, a six-year resident, "and the next 
minute the right side of my building is coming down." 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty yards away, Scott Bui heard rather than saw as he headed across Reseda 
Boulevard toward his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 At first "it felt like a wave -- like you were standing on a surfboard," said 
Bui, 20, a Cal State Northridge student who had just pulled up after driving 
from his girlfriend's home in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But the shaking grew violent. The lights blew out. Dust choked the air. And 
Bui, knocked to his knees on the asphalt, heard a huge crash -- the sound of 
Northridge Meadows collapsing onto its first floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Jolted awake in Apt. 101, Hyun Sook Lee, a nurse, thought her husband was 
doing something to shake the apartment. She quickly realized she was wrong. A 
slender woman, she literally flew through the air as the tremors intensified. 
When she landed, she found the ceiling on top of her. She was bruised and cut 
across the knee, but alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people on the first floor never knew what hit them. But others slowly 
died in their beds, unable to breathe as they were crushed under the weight of 
two stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Second- and third-floor residents had no idea that the complex had crunched 
down 15 feet and pitched north another 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The pulse of auto alarms, and human screams, pierced the blackness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is everyone all right?" "We're trapped!" "Oh, God, help us!" 
</P>
<P>
 But help from the outside would not arrive for almost an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Sirens approached within the first 10 minutes, but wailed past and faded. Los 
Angeles City Fire Department Capt. Bob Fickett and his six-man crew saw the 
damage at Northridge Meadows but did not stop. Earthquake procedures demanded 
that they first survey the entire neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 They knew they would be back. But they did not immediately realize that a 
three-story complex had pancaked. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, Scott Bui's 18-year-old sister, Diana, wondered why the firefighters 
kept going. "I think they just drove by and thought, 'That's a two-story 
building,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents, such as Langdon and his roommate, Jerry Prezioso, 67, could do 
nothing but wait. In the southeast corner, in Apt. 106, both men were trapped 
in their bedrooms, pinned by the ceiling and walls that had splintered and 
fallen. They were conscious and communicating, but neither could get free. 
</P>
<P>
 Nails dug into Prezioso's abdomen. Langdon's ribs had cracked, puncturing a 
lung. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared, but Jerry said not to worry -- that if we were alive, there had 
to be a reason for it," said Langdon, 45. 
</P>
<P>
 The building nearly crushed Raymond Goodwin, as well as his girlfriend and two 
friends staying in his first-floor apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything started falling. All of the ceiling was falling on us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miraculously, it stopped just four feet short of Goodwin and his friends, who 
were able to scramble out. 
</P>
<P>
 On the north side of the complex, in Apt. 351, a prime unit overlooking the 
inner courtyard, Erik Pearson sprang into action. Wearing only sweats and 
tennis shoes, he dashed to his front door, tramping on glass and debris, and 
found it jammed shut. Pearson, 27, searched for another way out of the 
apartment he had lived in for just a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to die!" his wife, Susan, shrieked. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson, a certified emergency medical technician, switched into rescue mode. 
He went over the balcony and made his way to the ground. He ran into one of the 
buildings and punched his fist into a glass-encased emergency cubbyhole, 
pulling out a fire hose to use as a rope. He then hurried back and used the 
hose to help his wife escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Others followed his example. They flung fire hoses to residents on their 
balconies, shouting instructions to tie the hoses and shinny down. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrified by powerful aftershocks, tenants clambered over second-story 
balconies now at ground level, leaving behind all their possessions. Those who 
could spilled into alleys north and south of the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-story dwellers groped through darkened hallways, crawling up floors that 
had buckled three feet high in places. They picked their way down crumbled 
stairwells into the courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the older renters, who with college students made up the bulk of the 
tenants, had to be carried away from the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Kubeisy, a free-lance photographer who lived on the top floor on the 
western edge of the complex, relied on faith to escape an apartment riddled 
with gaping holes in the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a Christian. The Scripture says: '(God) will direct your path,' " 
Kubeisy, 34, said. "I have no doubt that's what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Out in the hallway, he and a friend pounded on doors, called out to those 
still trapped and shepherded a trembling elderly neighbor onto a hanging ladder 
thrown up by others. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't want to come out. So I literally looked into his eyes and said, 
'Norm, you don't have an option,' " Kubeisy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a familiar smell brought him up short. 
</P>
<P>
 "Turn off the gas barbecues! Turn off the gas!" he yelled frantically. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors had lighted candles. A few in the courtyard were smoking cigarettes. 
Tenants aware of the danger ordered everyone to extinguish the flames. Resident 
Robin Dunn, a gas company employee, scrambled to shut off gas to the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Still trapped within the walls of the complex, down the corridor from Kubeisy, 
Curt Harkless hammered his way out of his apartment, although he had sprained 
his left hand when the floor of his bedroom fell out from under him. With the 
same hammer, he freed the woman next door, who pleaded for sugar and something 
to drink. Harkless handed her a Pepsi, one of three cans he had slipped into 
his jacket on the way out. 
</P>
<P>
 Together they inched down the hall, joined by others who kicked in doors along 
the way. Within minutes they descended into the courtyard, where dozens of 
dazed survivors were gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a tranquil suburban sanctuary complete with putting green, swimming pool, 
Jacuzzi and a network of running streams, the courtyard resembled a war zone. 
Trees had fallen. Shattered glass was everywhere. Older residents huddled in 
chairs, babies bawled, and young and old hugged each other in consolation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary McDonald tried to comfort her friend Elizabeth Plant, who was suffering 
from chest pains. Both women had managed to break out of first-floor 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Blatt of Apt. 263 became Northridge Meadows' link to the outside world. 
With Pearson's help, he squeezed out of the complex through a gap in the 
northwest wall, then ran for the fire station at Lassen Street, a mile north. 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters had gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were two ladies in lawn chairs sitting on the driveway of the fire 
station, and I said: 'Where are the firemen?' " recalled Blatt, 25. "I said: 
'Look, you have to tell them that 9565 Reseda Boulevard has collapsed. People 
are dying in there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters, when they passed at 4:40 a.m., had noticed that the building was 
in trouble. But they had other problems, too: a mall collapse, several major 
fires and a multitude of gas leaks. It would be another 45 minutes before they 
could work their way back to Northridge Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the courtyard, Beverly Reading hoped that her friend Ruth Wilhelm, 77, 
a recent widow who lived in Apt. 127, would appear, but she knew hope was 
slight. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson had tried to save Wilhelm after seeing her leg protruding from a pile 
of beams and hearing her hoarse cries. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he returned with a neighbor, he was met with silence. Desperate, 
Pearson crawled into the tiny crevice that had been the woman's bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I yelled at her, shined a light in, pushed a leg, tried to get her to respond 
to me," he said. "Unfortunately, she had passed away." 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson wept. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without tears, it was impossible for anyone to see clearly. The lights 
were out. The moon had set hours ago. A red glow from a nearby fire brought 
embers but no illumination. Only a few flashlight beams sliced through the 
pitch darkness -- and until dawn, they were the only source of light. 
</P>
<P>
 Worried relatives were converging on the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Angeline Cerone, 80, whom everyone knew as Ann, had lived in Apt. 103 for more 
than two decades. When no one answered the phone, her grandson, Stephen, 28, 
rushed over from Van Nuys. When he peered inside what he thought was his 
grandmother's unit, he was puzzled to see furniture and personal items that he 
did not recognize. Suddenly, he realized he was squinting into a second-story 
apartment, and that his grandmother's unit was beneath. 
</P>
<P>
 Two doors away, Hyun Sook Lee screamed for her sons and her husband. There was 
no response from Pil Soon or their older son, Howard, 14, but finally 
12-year-old Jason answered. His legs were pinned. Unable to move herself, she 
told him to fight free of the debris. He cried that he couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keep trying," his mother commanded. Finally, Jason yanked his legs free, 
straining so hard that he dislocated his right leg. The toes on his other foot 
were crushed and bleeding but Jason began crawling in the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 As the dawn broke, Jason squeezed through a 14-inch-wide hole and emerged into 
the arms of other tenants who, hearing his cries, pulled him free. He had been 
trapped inside 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 It took rescuers 15 more minutes to dig out his mother, who recited Hail Marys 
until she was freed. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the collapsed entryway, in Apt. 104, a young man known to 
firefighters only as Robert cried out in horror. He was pinned, trapped with 
three of his friends. Shouting through the walls, he said he had heard them 
screaming. Then, helpless, he had heard them die. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first half-hour, fire Capt. Fickett and his crew worked alone -- six 
men covering 160 apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realized as soon as we got back there, 'Holy Christ, this is major,' " 
Fickett said of the collapsed building. 
</P>
<P>
 The first round of reinforcements arrived about 6 a.m. As soon as he stepped 
off his truck, firefighter Jim Walter was swarmed by people telling about 
others trapped inside. The arrival of his company doubled the contingent of 
firefighters. About 20 minutes later, Battalion Chief Bob De Feo arrived from 
Hollywood and took charge, along with Station 73's captain, Steve Bascom. 
</P>
<P>
 From their command post, a Ford Escort covered with concrete dust, the 16 
firefighters made a dogged stand. They repeatedly tried to summon 
reinforcements on their radios, but other rescue units were busy. 
</P>
<P>
 They would win a few battles, then lose some. 
</P>
<P>
 By now it was light -- 6:30 a.m., two hours after the quake had collapsed the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Splitting into three teams, the firefighters began a methodical search, 
clearing people from the second and third floors. They carried out a man with 
cerebral palsy, and an elderly woman who had just had hip surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 They broke down the door of one apartment to free an elderly man, who had 
started to vacuum his carpet. They persuaded him to leave, hurrying him up a 
corridor that tilted at a 60-degree angle. 
</P>
<P>
 Fickett paced the perimeter of the huge building, questioning residents who 
were pulling each other out of the courtyard and into the alleyway: "Do you 
know of anybody that's trapped? Have you heard any voices? Have you gone around 
and yelled?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson and other residents struggled to finish the work they had begun, 
digging into sunken first-floor apartments inside the courtyard, trying to 
reach those still trapped. But at least five times, Pearson discovered a 
lifeless limb jutting from the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone keeps asking me, 'You're a hero, Erik, how do you feel?,' " Pearson 
said. "I don't feel like a hero, because I had to see five people dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert -- firefighters never learned his full name -- was freed in about an 
hour and taken to Northridge Hospital Medical Center. That night he was so 
terrified, he refused to leave the hospital. He slept in the lounge. 
</P>
<P>
 Prezioso had lived in Apt. 106 for 20 years, but he said two decades felt like 
nothing compared to the five hours he spent trapped. 
</P>
<P>
 He joked with his roommate that the next time they moved, "let's get an 
apartment on the top floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Prezioso watched as firefighters used a jack to clear away bricks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see the blue sky!" he exclaimed when freed. "It's beautiful!" 
</P>
<P>
 To get to Langdon, rescuers tunneled 15 feet deeper inside the building. 
</P>
<P>
 They found Langdon beneath another collapsed wall, wedged underneath a chest 
of drawers, his head hanging off his bed and painfully pinched by rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 The rescues of the two men were cheered by onlookers and boosted the 
firefighters, who by then had seen too many bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a while there, it was 'There's another dead body. Here's another one. 
Here's another one. When's it going to end?' " De Feo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Hemsath, 37, trapped beneath his refrigerator in Apt. 110, was the last 
tenant they found alive. 
</P>
<P>
 His parents, Rusty and Verna, waited anxiously in an alleyway, where they knew 
their son would be carried out to an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifteen minutes," they were promised over and over, but the wait seemed 
interminable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the longest 15 minutes in the world," Rusty Hemsath said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hemsath was carried out, the rescue mission turned to a body recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen of the 16 dead were found lying in their beds. 
</P>
<P>
 Many died like Sharon Englar, 58, and her husband, Phil, 62, who were found 
holding hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaime Reyes, 19, spent his final moments trying to shield his girlfriend, 
Myrna Velasquez, 18, from the collapsing walls and ceiling of Apt. 104. In the 
other bedroom, roommate Manuel Sandoval, who had moved in only the day before, 
was crushed to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecilia and David Pressman, both 72 and married for 51 years, died in an 
embrace in Apt. 105. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who slept alone covered their faces, their expressions painful proof 
that death was not always instantaneous. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters said these operations were particularly difficult because as they 
worked, crowds of friends and relatives looked over their shoulders, clinging 
to hope when often there was none. The aftershocks rattled nerves, and the work 
was arduous. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing was as difficult as fire Capt. Dave Thompson's grim task: 
informing Hyun Sook Lee that her 14-year-old son, the boy who aspired to be a 
priest, had died in his bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, a veteran who flew a medical evacuation helicopter in Vietnam, 
approached Lee as she stood silently by the tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ma'am, listen to me. Your son, how old is your son?" 
</P>
<P>
 She began to cry. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to talk to me. It's very important," Thompson gently urged. "How old 
is he? 14? He's 14? Is there anyone else in the bedroom?" 
</P>
<P>
 She said her husband might be in there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ma'am, your husband is not in the bedroom. He's not in the bedroom. It's just 
your son." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as chain saws continued whining, Thompson's voice dropped and he 
delivered the bad news: 
</P>
<P>
 "This son is dead, ma'am. He is dead. There's nothing we can do for him. We'll 
look for your husband next." 
</P>
<P>
 Pil Soon Lee's body was the 16th, and last, to be carried from the building at 
10:50 a.m. Tuesday, more than 30 hours after the earthquake.

 The earthquake killed 16 people at Northridge Meadows Apartments, making it 
the single deadliest location. But rescuers were able to save as many as 10 
victims. The rescue team, totaling more than 160 people, consisted of police, 
city and county fire department Urban Search and Rescue units and two 56-member 
FEMA response teams. They searched the building, recovering victims and 
providing treatment.

MANY CALL FOR TOUGHER CODES, RETROFITTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like aftershocks rattling the region, the death and destruction from the 
Northridge earthquake is triggering calls for tougher building codes and 
expanded efforts to strengthen structures across Los Angeles and other 
quake-prone parts of California. 
</P>
<P>
 As with every major California earthquake in the last 60 years, the toll of 
last Monday's 6.6-magnitude temblor in lives and property damage has thrust the 
issue of seismic safety to the forefront of public attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake safety experts warn that as devastating as the quake was, leaving 
51 dead and more than 2,300 buildings uninhabitable, the losses could have been 
far worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been so lucky," said Samuel Aroni, former dean of UCLA's School of 
Architecture and Urban Planning. "What would have happened if this earthquake 
had occurred at 4 in the afternoon instead of 4 in the morning? Thousands of 
people would have been killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Aroni said only by learning the lessons from this quake and engaging in a 
concerted effort to prevent the collapse of buildings and freeways can the loss 
of life and property be reduced the next time the earth moves violently. "We 
can't rely on luck," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Building officials, engineers and geologists said in interviews that a major 
part of that effort must involve the tightening of building codes and the 
strengthening of structures -- from smaller brick buildings to apartment 
complexes and commercial structures to parking garages, and City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 As squadrons of building inspectors examined thousands of structures that 
suffered the quake's wrath, a preliminary picture began to emerge about the 
types of buildings that did well and those that fared poorly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The newer buildings in the city did not suffer the damage the older ones 
did," said Bob Steinbach, emergency management coordinator for the Los Angeles 
Department of Building and Safety. A Times computer analysis found that 
two-thirds of the buildings declared unsafe were built before codes were 
strengthened after the 1971 Sylmar quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Building officials credited those code revisions with improving the seismic 
safety of newer buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks, months and years to come, the question of why some buildings 
survived and others failed will be the subject of much investigation and 
discussion at City Hall and in the state Capitol. City Council hearings are 
planned in the coming weeks, after building officials complete their 
assessments. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the task of inspecting damaged buildings is complete, Steinbach said 
engineers will do a structural analysis of every building that was declared 
unsafe "to see why it didn't perform the way it was designed." 
</P>
<P>
 Already there are calls from several council members for stricter building 
codes for new structures and new requirements for retrofitting older buildings 
to save lives and reduce property damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Hal Bernson, who led the fight to require buttressing of 
unreinforced brick buildings that are considered the most hazardous, said the 
time to act is now, before the danger posed by earthquakes recedes from the 
public's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a tragedy like this, there is going to be an opportunity," Bernson 
said. "It is only after something like this that you can get legislation that's 
tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Every major earthquake has its hallmark of tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 The images of the collapsed Veterans Administration hospital in Sylmar and 
buckled freeway overpasses in the San Fernando Valley linger as the legacy of 
the 1971 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The television pictures of the twisted and crumbled Nimitz Freeway resting on 
top of commuters' cars and the broken upper deck of the San Francisco-Oakland 
Bay Bridge are vivid reminders of the devastation unleashed by the 1989 Loma 
Prieta quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1933 Long Beach quake that killed 115 people and led to the first 
seismic safety standards, every major earthquake has generated its own 
response. 
</P>
<P>
 After 49 people died in the collapse of a Sylmar hospital, legislation was 
passed to require stricter earthquake standards for new hospitals. The state 
also took the first steps to begin retrofitting freeway bridges to resist 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 When 43 people lost their lives on the Nimitz and Bay Bridge, strengthening 
freeway overpasses, bridges and interchanges took on sudden urgency -- an 
effort that continues today. 
</P>
<P>
 With last week's quake, the starkest scenes may be of crippled freeways and 
the collapsed apartment building in Northridge where 16 died in the worst 
concentration of death. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other haunting images of destruction -- crumbled brick buildings, 
pancaked parking structures, a mangled mall and concrete offices reduced to 
rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 It is these failures that will be scrutinized most closely to determine what 
directions new and revised codes should take and where retrofitting efforts 
should be concentrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Although California has the strictest seismic safety codes in the nation, the 
magnitude of the damage stunned building officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "To those at the epicenter, this was the Big One," said Gerald Takaki, chief 
of the Los Angeles Building and Safety Department's Bureau of Community Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Building officials must learn what happened to the three-story Northridge 
apartment building that suffered severe damage when one floor collapsed onto 
another, Takaki said. "We're going to have to look at that very closely." 
</P>
<P>
 City and state officials said the wood-frame Northridge Meadows apartment 
building did not appear to have plywood reinforcement in the stucco walls, a 
seismic safety feature that was not required at the time of construction in the 
early 1970s, but is now. The builder said he believes that plywood was used. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, two years after the Sylmar quake, the building code for new apartment 
buildings was tightened to require plywood in the exterior walls to help resist 
the lateral movement of an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The code was not retroactive. But the Northridge apartment's collapse prompted 
former state geologist James Slosson to say: "Now we have to do it for 
apartment houses built from 1950 to 1972." 
</P>
<P>
 After seeing the building, Tom Tobin, executive director of the California 
Seismic Safety Commission, urged local officials to require reinforcement and 
strengthening of older low-rise apartment buildings, especially those built 
over parking garages. "They clearly have a very characteristic weakness," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson, whose heavily damaged San Fernando Valley council district includes 
the quake's epicenter, vowed to press for passage of an ordinance that would 
require retrofitting the type of apartment complex that failed. "They have 
proved to be one of the most dangerous types of buildings that we have," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Building officials also are concerned about the failure of a number of 
so-called tilt-up buildings, commonly one-story or two-story warehouses or 
commercial buildings, where the concrete walls are lifted into place and 
anchored to a wooden roof. In a serious earthquake, the walls can tear away, 
collapsing the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Deppe, former chief of the city's Earthquake Safety Division, said the 
collapse of tilt-up buildings in the 1987 Whittier Narrows quake caused the 
building department to draft a retrofit ordinance for that type of 
construction. The proposal was ready more than a year ago, Deppe said, but did 
not go to the City Council because of concerns about its impact on businesses 
during a deep recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobin said the estimated 100,000 tilt-up buildings across the state are "the 
backbone of California commerce" and should be safeguarded. Retrofitting is 
relatively simple, he said, and can be done at a reasonable cost by installing 
steel straps to link the roof to the concrete walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Much more difficult and costly is strengthening older concrete frame buildings 
that are not flexible enough to withstand powerful shaking in a major quake. 
Building officials said one of these structures, the Kaiser Permanente building 
in Granada Hills, suffered severe damage when the concrete in supporting 
columns shattered. 
</P>
<P>
 The same problem, officials said, forced demolition of a severely damaged 
high-rise medical office building at Olympic Boulevard and Barrington Avenue on 
the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson said he wants building officials to consider requiring the 
retrofitting of this kind of "non-ductile" concrete building, which sometimes 
are too rigid to withstand the bending of earthquake forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Requiring retrofitting of buildings is not an easy task for government. 
</P>
<P>
 If history is any guide, property owners are likely to resist efforts to force 
them to upgrade existing buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 It took until 1981 -- 10 years after the Sylmar earthquake -- for the city to 
adopt an ordinance requiring owners of unreinforced masonry buildings of more 
than four units to strengthen them so the walls that support the building do 
not collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Deppe said 95% of the city's 8,100 unreinforced masonry buildings 
built before 1933 have been retrofitted or demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Monday's quake caused extensive damage, Deppe credited the retrofit 
program for the fact that no one died in the older brick buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, whose Hollywood district was hard hit in 
the quake, said she wants officials to study whether the retrofit requirement 
for unreinforced masonry buildings should be expanded to brick buildings with 
fewer units. 
</P>
<P>
 Building officials also would like to extend the retrofit program to include 
other steel and concrete frame buildings that have unreinforced masonry in the 
walls. Deppe said City Hall is the tallest building of this type in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not embracing any specific changes, City Council President John 
Ferraro introduced a motion Friday calling on building officials and the Fire 
Department to review the building code and make recommendations for "any 
earthquake reinforcements to damaged structures that may be needed to avoid 
collapse of those structures" in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes an earthquake to get people's attention," said Bill Petak, executive 
director of USC's Institute of Safety and Systems Management. "Society tends to 
be pretty reactionary. It's the horse-out-of-the-barn syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
 A member of a recently formed city commission on seismic safety, Petak said 
there is a need to move ahead with an expanded retrofitting program for 
existing buildings. "New buildings are not the problem," he said. "It's the old 
buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulty boils down to economics -- a struggle between the need for 
seismic safety and property owners who would be forced to pay the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trying to get ordinances and legislation passed that cause building owners to 
spend sums of money to retrofit these buildings has always been a problem," 
said Rawn Nelson, president-elect of the Structural Engineers Assn. of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took 10 years to get through L.A. city an acceptable ordinance for 
retrofitting of the unreinforced brick buildings. It took longer for the state 
to adopt it, and for the local municipalities to then follow through and 
enforce it," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 To ease the burden on building owners, the Seismic Safety Commission's Tobin 
believes that some kind of tax credit or tax incentives are needed for those 
who invest in earthquake safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Slosson, the former state geologist, said "the basic philosophy . . . is as 
you learn, you improve design and construction. There is a gradual 
improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 But it is far more difficult to win approval for measures that require changes 
in existing buildings. "Unless (there is) a very serious crisis, you never make 
the code retroactive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attention needs to be paid to retrofitting hospitals that were built before 
the Sylmar quake and have not been upgraded, Slosson said. The law passed after 
the Veterans Administration hospital collapsed applied only to new hospitals, 
not existing ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Nuys-based geologist also urged officials to examine the design of 
parking structures where hundreds of people can be found at peak periods during 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking structures at the Northridge Fashion Center and Cal State Northridge 
campus collapsed or suffered severe damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The code obviously is not stringent enough on precast (concrete) parking 
structures," said Bob Harder, manager of the Building and Safety Department's 
Van Nuys office. "We need to look at that again." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Harder said, building officials need to look at construction of 
single-family homes which, according to a Times analysis, accounted for 18% of 
the buildings declared uninhabitable so far. Many homes sustained major damage, 
he noted, even though they were bolted to their foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 Local, state and federal governments have much work to do to improve the 
seismic safety of their own facilities, said Tobin of the Seismic Safety 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think government should be ashamed of its progress. There is no question 
that government is far behind," he said. "Earthquakes are something that will 
happen. We all have a responsibility to deal with them." Proposed Changes 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the Northridge earthquake, several Los Angeles City 
Council members are calling for stricter building codes and expanded programs 
to improve the seismic safety of structures that suffered heavy damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Unreinforced masonry buildings: City building officials say a retrofit program 
to prevent collapse of older brick buildings saved lives. One proposal would 
expand the effort to residential buildings with four units or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Apartments: Attention is focused on the design and construction of low-rise 
apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking structures: Building officials want to investigate why modern parking 
structures failed in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Concrete office buildings: The Kaiser Permanente clinic and office building in 
Granada Hills that failed in the quake is an example of an older concrete 
building that lacks the flexibility to ride out severe shaking.

A MILESTONE: FIRST VOUCHER FOR NEW HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Winded and giddy, his wife and children exhausted, his neighbors still mired 
in a maze of red tape, an out-of-work janitor on Sunday registered a milestone 
for this punch-drunk metropolis: Lundy Macias got a new home. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a week after the quake demolished their creaking Hollywood apartment 
house, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros announced that 
Macias and his family would be the first to rent a new home under a hastily 
deployed federal voucher program. Despite early problems in processing the 
overwhelming crush of applicants, Cisneros promised that the Maciases' success 
story will be the first of hundreds as Los Angeles fights its way to recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 To the 30-year-old handyman, who had spent the week riding back and forth to 
the local disaster relief center on his bicycle -- the only transportation he 
has -- the announcement was a welcome jolt in a week of aftershocks, geologic 
and otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just a few days ago, I was in tears. Now we feel like we just landed in 
Beverly Hills," Macias exulted as his weary wife, Linda, rocked their 
4-month-old infant on her hip. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told the senator or secretary or whatever-he-is-Cisneros, 'Man, thanks for 
coming through, and don't forget to tell Mr. Clinton I said hi!' " 
</P>
<P>
 The federal emergency housing program under which Macias and his family got 
their new apartment is aimed at allowing low-income quake victims to rent 
replacement homes quickly. Cisneros said HUD has been authorized to distribute 
as many as 10,000 vouchers if the need arises -- and from initial statistics, 
it appears that it will. By Sunday morning in the city of Los Angeles alone, 
building and safety inspectors had declared nearly 11,000 units at least 
temporarily uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
 But the voucher program was a touchy subject along the long lines for aid, as 
the waiting list for a processing appointment began to stretch into the middle 
of next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the quake, more than 80,000 poor residents had been waiting for a 
year or longer to qualify for similar housing assistance. The new voucher 
program has pushed needy quake victims to the head of the line, but the help 
has not been as immediate as some of the dispossessed had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how much more I can take. I've been living in my car. I washed 
up at a McDonald's this morning," said Lois Stroud, a 38-year-old nurse's aide 
at a Downtown area group home. 
</P>
<P>
 Stroud said she is afraid to go either to her quake-damaged apartment or a 
public shelter because both places have roofs that she fears could cave in. She 
cannot wait to find a new home. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday morning, it was unclear how long that process would take. She had an 
appointment, she said, but it could take days or weeks for federal officials to 
verify that she was indeed left homeless by the quake and not among the 
thousands of otherwise needy families in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 And so she sat patiently, her application in triplicate on her lap, along with 
her pocketbook, which contained a towel, soap and deodorant. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a few blocks away, Macias was as good a personification as any for 
Los Angeles' resilient side. He laughed and jammed his hands into his jeans 
pockets as he talked about the wild ride that has been his week. 
</P>
<P>
 When the quake hit, he said, he and his family were asleep in their 
$475-a-month apartment, No. 307, in a rickety, four-story apartment house on 
Kenmore Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ceiling dropped in and all we could think about were the kids," he 
recalled. "We didn't know if we were going to live or die. We just stood there 
with the whole place shaking, with my wife holding the baby and me trying not 
to lose our 4-year-old. When we finally went out (into the hallway), all the 
lights were out and all the fire doors were shut." 
</P>
<P>
 Edging forward in the inky dark, their feet crunching on cracked plaster and 
shards of glass, Macias and his wife managed to locate a stub of candle, which 
they split in half and used to light their way down two flights of stairs to 
the street. The minute they were clear of the building, they said, they ran 
across the street and sat down on the curb -- a handyman and a housewife with a 
baby daughter and a toddler son, "wondering what we were gonna do next." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Macias said, he was simply elated to be alive. By afternoon, his 
sister had offered his family shelter in her apartment nearby. But a day later, 
reality was setting in, Macias said; his sister's apartment manager had 
informed her that if her guests stayed more than 15 days, the landlord would 
raise her rent. Meanwhile, his apartment manager was arguing with him over his 
security deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me that my money had gone to the people who had moved out when we 
moved in," Macias said. "He told me I'd have to take him to court." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a setback he could ill afford, Macias said. The family has been on Aid 
to Families With Dependent Children since last year, when he lost his 
janitorial job. Although he has looked daily for work, he said, he has been 
unable to find any opening that pays enough in salary and benefits to support 
his family, and the small odd jobs he has done in the interim have only worked 
to lower his welfare grant. Without an address, there was no place for the 
state to forward his welfare check. Without a check, there was no hope of 
obtaining a new apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had 15 days and then I was going to be on the street," he said. "I broke 
down and cried." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he said, he collected himself. It occurred to him that he may have lost 
his home, but his hustle was still intact. He left his wife and children at his 
sister's home and balanced his short, thick body on his bike and rode down to 
the carnival-like collection of tents and card tables on the grounds of the 
Hollywood Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 He got in line and got an appointment to meet with an assistance worker the 
next day, and when that day came, he showed up two hours early and got in line 
again. He was prepared to be dogged, he said, but as it turned out, he was 
called early, which was a good thing -- the paperwork, he said, took four 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The program operates under the rules that traditionally govern Section 8 
housing, with the exception that in addition to being poor the applicants must 
also have lost their homes to the quake. The Section 8 voucher program requires 
the applicants to spend up to 30% of their income on rent, with the federal 
government making up the difference between that amount and the fair market 
rent. It is up to the applicant to find a landlord willing to accept the 
federal subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 Macias said assistance workers demanded proof that his building had been 
rendered uninhabitable. They would not take his word, he said, that the floors 
now tilted crazily and the ceiling had caved in. 
</P>
<P>
 "They sent inspectors to the building. We had to give the full information," 
he said. "But the (voucher) paperwork was just one sheet. It wasn't bad. I was 
more than surprised." 
</P>
<P>
 The processing, he said, took more time. But by the arrival of the weekend, he 
had a housing voucher good for a new Section 8 apartment. Then, when he found 
an apartment, he had more snafus -- the HUD inspector told him that the unit 
lacked a working smoke alarm, that if it wasn't replaced, the unit would not 
qualify, and that Macias had 25 minutes to get the job done because the 
inspector's shift was about to end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got back on that bike," he laughed, "and I rode till my legs hurt." But in 
short order, the alarm was replaced and the apartment was his. It is on the 
first floor of a newer building less than a mile from the disaster relief 
tents, a two-bedroom unit that normally rents for $750 a month. With the 
Section 8 voucher, Macias will be able to stay for 18 months at the 
much-reduced rent of $193. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus was Macias counting himself among the lucky on Sunday, standing in the 
middle of a crush of reporters and cameramen in an otherwise empty living room 
with an empty kitchen and two empty bedrooms behind him and not a stick of 
furniture to interrupt the brown wall-to-wall carpeting. All of his family's 
possessions, he said, are in a condemned building now, and he is afraid to go 
in and carry them out. 
</P>
<P>
 His new home is across the street from a pawnshop, on the route of a produce 
vendor whose truck horn plays "La Cucaracha" when he beeps. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I ain't crying," Macias said. "I got a roof over my head. God shined on 
me. And once I got my family settled in, and my gas and electricity turned on, 
I'm gonna go back to that assistance center and give 'em a hand. As I 
understand it, they're pretty overwhelmed."

RUSSIAN CONSERVATIVE GAINS FROM REFORMERS' FAILURES; POLITICS: AS PRIME 
MINISTER CHERNOMYRDIN'S POWER STRENGTHENS, HOPE FOR A WESTERN-STYLE ECONOMY 
FADES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to charisma, he's no match for Boris N. Yeltsin or Vladimir V. 
Zhirinovsky. He sat out last month's parliamentary elections, quietly 
supporting two parties that finished far back. 
</P>
<P>
 His job performance in 1993, his first year as head of the Cabinet, was just 
as mediocre: The economy shrank 14%; prices shot up 900%. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin has gained more clout than any other 
figure from Russia's recent political upheavals. As President Yeltsin comes to 
resemble an aloof constitutional monarch, and Zhirinovsky's populist tantrums 
start to bore fellow lawmakers, Chernomyrdin is shaping a far more conservative 
government in his own gray, managerial image. 
</P>
<P>
 The 55-year-old prime minister, who once ran the Soviet gas industry, took the 
initiative after free-market candidates close to Yeltsin fared poorly in the 
parliamentary vote. While two reform economists quit the Cabinet last week and 
Yeltsin kept silent, Chernomyrdin announced a new lineup and a new mandate -- 
no more Western-style monetarist reform at the expense of production. 
</P>
<P>
 "What sort of reforms can one talk about at a time when huge enterprises come 
to a standstill?" he asked. "No matter how progressive it might be, no theory 
can by itself salvage a huge country from shortages of food, energy and 
commodities. . . . If we fail to boost production, we will fail to salvage the 
emerging market economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Chernomyrdin is convinced that the state must return to a bigger role in the 
economy, supporting heavy industry and collective agriculture -- unprofitable 
stalwarts of the failed Soviet system. How far he can go in slowing the 
reformers' 2-year-old effort to shrink the state -- or in reviving a 
central-command economy -- remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear, for example, whether Boris G. Fyodorov, the strict-monetarist 
finance minister who quit Thursday, is really out. Amid signs of unease in the 
West, Chernomyrdin asked him Saturday to stay but refused his demand for more 
authority in the Cabinet. Fyodorov said he will press his case in a meeting 
with Yeltsin this week. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also worth remembering that Chernomyrdin serves at Yeltsin's pleasure. If 
the prime minister tries his statist approach and it fails, the president has a 
constitutional right to fire him. 
</P>
<P>
 But Russian politics is more complex. As Yeltsin has retreated from the 
details of government, Chernomyrdin has spread his influence throughout the 
Russian bureaucracy. He is far more confident, and much less malleable, today 
than the awkward, mumbling, seemingly transitional figure who became prime 
minister 13 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before our very eyes, power is shifting from Yeltsin to Chernomyrdin," said 
Mikhail Berger, a columnist for the newspaper Izvestia. "Maybe with the 
president's consent or maybe without it, but that is what's happening." 
</P>
<P>
 People who know Chernomyrdin say two life experiences define him. 
</P>
<P>
 First, he's a consummate apparatchik. A street-fighting village kid from 
Russia's Orenburg region, he finished high school with a C-minus average and 
flunked math in a technical institute entrance exam. But thanks to army and 
party connections, he got a degree and moved up the Communist ladder, rising 
from machine operator at an oil refinery to a Central Committee post. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, that career ladder passed through the gas industry, still the most 
regulated sector of the Russian economy. He became Soviet gas minister in 1985 
and turned the ministry into a profitable state corporation, earning a third of 
Russia's export revenue. The experience gave him only a narrow understanding of 
economics and a strong bias toward state control. 
</P>
<P>
 A gruff, heavy-set man prone to wisecracks and foul language, Chernomyrdin 
shares Yeltsin's earthy, muzhik image and Communist background. He won 
Yeltsin's admiration -- and a post in the Cabinet -- by giving a better speech 
at a 1992 gas seminar than the pro-reform government economist in charge of 
that sector. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1992, with living standards falling and reformers in retreat, 
Yeltsin named him prime minister, replacing acting premier Yegor T. Gaidar, the 
brains behind the reforms. At Yeltsin's insistence, Chernomyrdin kept most of 
Gaidar's team around him and brought in Fyodorov to control the money supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, however, Chernomyrdin became his own man. His ministry ballooned to 
more than 1,000 bureaucrats, taking from other agencies such powers as export 
licensing. He boosted his own political standing by touring the country with 
pork-barrel promises, then dumping on Fyodorov for refusing to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chernomyrdin has a keen sense of power, but no sense for policy," said 
Swedish economist Anders Aslund, an adviser to Fyodorov. 
</P>
<P>
 A Western official who meets with the prime minister added: "He doesn't 
understand that ruling the country means making some people unhappy. He wants 
to please everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 As Russia slid toward violent civil conflict last fall, Chernomyrdin wisely 
chose to back Yeltsin against the Soviet-era Parliament, then stayed out of the 
fractious Dec. 12 elections of a new one. With his nod, the state gas company 
helped finance two centrist parties -- Future of Russia-New Names and the 
Russian Party of Unity and Concord. Together they got 9% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily for Chernomyrdin, no party gained a majority. In part because Yeltsin 
didn't want a fight with Parliament over a new nominee, Chernomyrdin kept his 
post as a compromise between Gaidar's Russia's Choice on one side and the 
Communists and Zhirinovsky's ultranationalists on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading the vote as a mandate against reformers, Chernomyrdin muscled out 
Gaidar, who had rejoined the Cabinet in September, and stripped Fyodorov of his 
deputy prime minister rank. He brought in two ex-Soviet economic advisers, 
Nikolai Petrakov and Leonid Abalkin, to modify the plan they wrote for Civic 
Union, a centrist party led by factory bosses with little voter support. 
</P>
<P>
 "The return of these men means the return of administer-by-command economy," 
economist and Yeltsin adviser Pavel G. Bunich said. "The Civic Union lost the 
elections, but they have won the government." 
</P>
<P>
 Chernomyrdin told reporters last week that he will make good on $5 billion 
worth of promised credits to money-losing farms and defense plants, doubling 
the first-quarter budget deficit. To hold down inflation, he offered to try 
such "non-monetary" methods as wage and price controls. He also expressed 
support for a currency union with Belarus, which critics say will cost Russia 
$1.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Many economists believe that Chernomyrdin simply doesn't understand the 
inflationary consequences of such mega-spending and may be leading Yeltsin, who 
also has little grasp of economics, toward disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 A cartoon in Izvestia illustrates that view. It shows Chernomyrdin piggyback 
on Yeltsin, cupping his hands like horse blinders to narrow the president's 
vision. Yeltsin is staggering in circles, declaring, "We will not stray from 
the path of reforms!"

COLUMN ONE; SEEKING SOLACE IN SIMPLICITY; AFTER YEARS OF FAT LIVING, SOME 
JAPANESE EMBRACE THE IDEA THAT LESS IS MORE. THEY ALSO FIND INSPIRATION IN THE 
FEUDAL EDO ERA, AND THE BELIEF THAT 'THIS WAS PURE JAPAN, THE WAY WE WERE, THE 
WORLD WE LOST.' 
</P>

<P>
 Fumiaki Kuraishi has every material possession he could want: a 1991 Nissan 
car, a new refrigerator and washing machine, three televisions, two stereos, a 
videocassette recorder, a computer and word processor -- all crammed into the 
home he shares with his wife and two children. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the worst recession in two decades continues to cast a long, lingering 
shadow over Japan, Kuraishi says the heady materialism of the recent past is, 
for him, passe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little tired of finding new electronic gadgets," the 50-year-old 
government economist said. "I want to change my habits from spending to more 
spiritual satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
 So Kuraishi has sought inspiration by reading the works of renowned educator 
Yukichi Fukuzawa and others born in the late Edo era. Although the Edo -- from 
1603 to 1868 -- may be best known for the Tokugawa shogunate's foreign 
isolation and feudalistic repression, it also was a time of unparalleled peace 
and the blossoming of a vibrant, distinctive Japanese culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "We inherited many habits and ways of thinking from the Japanese in the Edo 
era," Kuraishi said. "By reading these older books, I found I can understand 
present Japan better." 
</P>
<P>
 As uncertainty and recession grip a land where many have sated material 
appetites during a long economic boom, experts say more Japanese are seeking 
lifestyles rooted in simplicity and spiritual wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 Advertising giant Dentsu calls it a shift from "valuing the tangible to the 
intangible." 
</P>
<P>
 The Japan External Trade Organization, in a new report on the Japanese in the 
1990s, says the economic downturn, wide disgust at political corruption and 
boredom with excessive consumption have led many to seek a life "with emphasis 
on moderation, quality rather than quantity and spiritual satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
 The paths toward more psychically enriching lives are diverse, ranging from 
nature activities to volunteerism to self-help seminars. 
</P>
<P>
 But some, like Kuraishi, are exploring their roots -- in particular, the 
lifestyle, arts, culture and economy of the Edo. 
</P>
<P>
 Books on the period, many recasting the former feudalistic image into a more 
creative one of simple living and cultural innovation, enjoy brisk sales; a 
plethora of new titles describe everything from Edo energy and technology to 
exorcists and cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisuke Ishikawa has written five books in the last seven years on the Edo but 
says they only began selling well in 1993 -- hitting the 20,000 mark, unusual 
for the genre. 
</P>
<P>
 Ishikawa and other authors depict the Edo as a dynamic time in which the 
Japanese lived in harmony with nature, using solar energy and vegetable oil, 
recycling everything from ash to straw slippers. This portrayal has caught the 
public fancy as a potential trove of lessons for modern Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trend was started before the bubble burst, but it was probably 
intensified by it," said Tessa Morris-Suzuki, a senior fellow in Japanese 
history at Australian National University in Canberra, who recently analyzed 
the Edo book trend. "At one level, it's a fad. But at another level, it's an 
important part of the debate about Japanese identity: how Japan will define its 
identity now that it has caught up with the West. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now Japan is trying to find its own models within itself," Morris-Suzuki 
said. "Edo is seen as a model, because it was the last period before Japan got 
heavily Westernized. So there is the idea that 'This was pure Japan, the way we 
were, the world we lost.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The period produced much of what is typically associated with Japan, from 
ukiyoe woodblock prints to brilliant Basho haiku poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 For those overdosed on materialism, the traditional Japanese aesthetic offers 
a soothing balance of understatement and tranquillity. At the same time, its 
popular culture, including sumo wrestling and Kabuki, offer raucous escape. 
</P>
<P>
 (The rich development of arts and leisure was promoted partly by more than 250 
years of internal peace. But it also grew out of the need to entertain 
thousands of samurai, who were forced to travel yearly to Edo -- the former 
name for Tokyo -- to pay homage to Tokugawa shoguns, who found the costly trips 
a handy way to prevent regional lords from acquiring excessive wealth and 
power.) 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Kabuki -- the highly stylized art form that combines dance and drama 
and that has typically attracted older audiences -- is drawing younger fans who 
have helped the theater record sellouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanae Hirama, 23, began attending performances last year; her frequent 
encounters with foreigners sparked a desire to explore her roots. A specialist 
in French literature who has been abroad five times, she was embarrassed at not 
being able to answer questions about Kabuki, geisha and ukiyoe.  
</P>
<P>
 Traditional music collections are enjoying record sales; tea ceremony and 
other cultural classes are gaining new followers. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's 1993 Leisure White Paper reported a 15.8% increase in 
participation in calligraphy and a 4.8% increase in tea ceremony in 1992 over 
the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Seibu, the retail and transportation conglomerate that is one of the nation's 
quickest trend-spotters, two years ago began a special "Japan Is Good" series 
of classes at the community college it operates in the Ikebukuro district of 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the classes, ranging from tea and Kabuki appreciation to samurai art, 
have waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's ultimate monument to the life of the era, the new Tokyo Edo Museum, 
has drawn more than 2 million people -- double the number projected -- since 
opening in March. 
</P>
<P>
 The cavernous museum features displays such as a life-size Kabuki theater 
replica, merchants' quarters, the famous Yoshiwara pleasure district, woodblock 
prints and the nagaya , or long rows of connected houses that gave Edo village 
life its distinctive communal feel. 
</P>
<P>
 For Tomie Sekiguchi, 51, the row houses stirred a nostalgia for a warm 
community life, in which families and neighbors traded gossip, laughter and 
meals; she rarely finds such camaraderie in this bustling 21st-Century city, 
where many complain that they live surprisingly isolated existences. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, she said, seeing the magnificent workmanship of Edo pottery 
underscored the wastefulness of modern society, where "everything is so cheap 
you just throw it away." 
</P>
<P>
 "During Edo, people really treasured things and kept them for a long time," 
Sekiguchi said. "Although they were poor, the family life was very warm. I want 
to pass these teachings on to my children." 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesman Masaichi Sugaya attributed the museum's unexpected popularity to the 
societal reflection that he says is occurring as many Japanese search for their 
next goal, now that material needs have been fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are wondering what kind of lifestyle to lead from now," he 
said. "Amid the Edo boom, as they look into the past, they are groping for 
answers." 
</P>
<P>
 A cultural revival of sorts is also occurring with food. 
</P>
<P>
 Displacing Thai and Italian cuisines, 1993's hottest trend was yatai mura , or 
colorful stalls selling down-home Japanese cooking, such as shrimp pancakes and 
boiled vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 Hirano Hisawa, a 33-year-old restaurateur, last year put up a food village in 
the Ikebukuro district, offering lively wooden stalls illuminated with red 
paper lanterns. His aim: to revive the flavor of old Tokyo and offer cheap, 
filling food amid the recession's gloom. 
</P>
<P>
 The village attracts crowds and long lines every night; his monthly revenue of 
$270,000 is running 50% higher than predictions. This year, he plans to open 
another food village in the nearby Okubo district with a stage for traditional 
plays and comedy and an area to demonstrate the art of pounding rice cakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Masako Yamazawa, a teacher waiting in line, said she came back to the food 
village not only because the recession has curtailed her spending but because 
she enjoys the rare, old-Tokyo flavor amid Ikebukuro's skyscrapers, department 
stores and ubiquitous fast-food joints. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Japanese stay home and read, they also encounter the Edo influence, 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The top buzzword of 1993, according to an annual poll of the mass media here, 
was seihin , which translates as "honest poverty." 
</P>
<P>
 It was popularized by the runaway bestseller "Seihin no Shiso," which examines 
the lives of 15 painters, scholars, monks and other paragons in the Edo and 
other periods and urges Japanese to end their mindless materialism. 
</P>
<P>
 Author Koji Nakano had been hammering the same theme in 40 books for 25 years, 
but most of his works sold about 10,000 copies each. In 1993, however, his 
"Seihin" sold 700,000 copies in a success that startled the publishing world 
and made him a national celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakano said that reflection is occurring not only in Japan but also in Europe 
and America, as industrialized nations seek ways to reconcile their voracious 
consumption and production with their limited natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
 If the United States has its Puritan ethic to draw upon for answers, Japan has 
the Edo, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarai, a magazine devoted to finding simple pleasures in Japanese history and 
tradition, was a surprising success among the many new publications launched 
during the "bubble era" of exploding prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
 As other magazines on real-estate and other material themes floundered with 
the recession's onset, Sarai has doubled its circulation, to 350,000 in 1993 
from 170,000, when it first started in 1989 as a deliberate counterpoint to 
"the bubble's" excesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent issues have featured the art of cultivating bonsai , living in modern 
nagaya row houses and good-luck totems. The largest group of readers are in 
their 50s -- people who devoted their lives to rebuilding Japan into an 
economic titan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until now, people have not had the time to look at themselves; they've just 
been busy running," said Satoshi Iwamoto, Sarai editor. "Now they're coming 
back to the basics." 
</P>
<P>
 That is exactly what one Tokyo publishing employee has been yearning to do. 
She is bored with spending money. During the prosperous days, she bought the 
most expensive perfume, ordered the most lavish French cuisine, took fancy 
vacations and accumulated a house filled with the latest electronic gadgetry. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there is nothing left she wants to buy. Since the economy crashed, she 
does not feel like spending in the gloomy environment anyway. So what does she 
seek next? 
</P>
<P>
 "Tranquillity," she said. "I want to go to a faraway temple that no one knows 
about, sit in a bamboo forest with moss-covered rocks and drink tea from a 
beautiful Japanese cup." 
</P>
<P>
 To pursue that quiet time for herself, she is thinking of taking up 
calligraphy. 
</P>
<P>
 But her husband, a computer specialist, is still happily spending. 
</P>
<P>
 And Dentsu, even as it proclaims an era when the intangible will be valued, 
notes that more than 80% of people recently surveyed still had something they 
wanted to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 As Japan Monitor put it: People want simpler lifestyles, not simple ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The move toward simplicity, in fact, could be bad news for the lagging 
economy, which is depending on consumer demand to revive itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japan Economic Research Assn. estimates that a 5% decrease in consumption 
would push the economy down to zero or negative growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Fujitsu Chairman Takuma Yamamoto is blunt in critiquing the "honest poverty" 
movement: "This is the thinking of social dropouts. As a businessman, the ideal 
is to earn enough money and consume to some extent. Nobody wants to live not 
getting things you want." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people also worry that Edo nostalgia could spark a worrisome nationalism 
or a trend toward that era's sakoku , or isolationism. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one is talking about shutting the world out, as if such a thing could 
be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Shinji Kuroki, 26, and Hajime Hosoda, 22, may eschew the guitar and choose to 
study biwa , a Japanese-style mandolin. 
</P>
<P>
 They may say that playing the biwa gives them a greater feeling of peace than 
Western instruments and better suits the Japanese language in which they sing 
of great battles between the Heike and the Genji clans. 
</P>
<P>
 But as they practice in a tatami room (one with bamboo mats) with their 
teacher, Yukihiro Goto, they mix their ancient instrument with the accordion 
and meld the traditional rhythms with the modern influences of jazz and rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Masayuki Kurokawa, an architect, has also returned to his roots by designing 
works such as teahouses, instead of the exclusively Western buildings of his 
past. But he retains a blend of old and new, combining washi paper with 
computer graphics in his latest design. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurokawa and others say that if the search for spiritual enrichment leads many 
back to their cultural roots, all the better: It will help Japan and the world 
comprehend each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not nationalism," he said. "If you can love Japan, you can love the 
world. By questioning who we are, we can deepen international understanding."

CORONA AREA IN UPROAR OVER SPRAYING PLAN; MEDFLY: LAWSUIT SEEKS TO BLOCK AERIAL 
APPLICATION OF MALATHION, SET TO START TONIGHT. LOCAL OFFICIALS SAY THEY ARE 
BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. STATE SAYS ACTION IS ESSENTIAL TO PROTECT 
AGRICULTURE.

 After 311 Mediterranean fruit flies were found in Los Angeles County in 1993, 
and 59 more in Orange County, and another 27 in San Bernardino County, state 
agricultural officials said they would flood the area with billions of sterile 
flies to try to rid the region of the crop-ravaging pest. 
</P>
<P>
 But after just one mated Medfly was found in Corona last month, the state said 
it would call in the air cavalry: a phalanx of helicopters swooping over the 
Riverside County city at 500 feet, spraying the insecticide malathion over 18 
square miles of city blocks, residential neighborhoods, parks, schools, farms 
and corrals. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement touched a communal nerve in Corona and its small rural 
neighbor, Norco. Residents have organized protests, local politicians and 
professors have challenged the state's findings that malathion is not 
dangerous, and the Corona City Council has taken the state to court to block 
the aerial spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're being dumped on. They picked our areas because they don't feel we have 
the political clout to stop it," said City Councilwoman Barbara Carmichael of 
Norco, part of which is in the aerial spraying target zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona City Councilman Jeff Bennett is equally outraged. "I told (state Food 
and Agriculture Secretary) Henry Voss we're being sprayed because we're just a 
bunch of hicks," Bennett said bitterly. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials put a decidedly different spin on the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery of even a single Medfly in Corona signaled to officials the 
likelihood that possibly hundreds of others were in the area. Officials said it 
was an ominous development because it showed that the fly had escaped 
previously quarantined areas of Los Angeles and Orange counties and could be 
headed toward farmlands and groves elsewhere in California, jeopardizing the 
state's No. 1 industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a serious economic as well as environmental issue that needs to be 
addressed," said Carl DeWing, spokesman for the Department of Food and 
Agriculture. "Aerial spraying is the only alternative we have at this point. 
We're not spraying on Corona because it has less political clout than L.A. We 
may still have to go into other areas with aerial spraying." 
</P>
<P>
 The spraying is scheduled to begin at 9 tonight -- the first of what may be as 
many as eight three-hour aerial applications of the insecticide here in the 
next five months. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Corona officials filed a lawsuit in Riverside Superior Court -- 
just as other communities did in 1989 and 1990 -- to stop the spraying. A 
hearing is set for today on whether to ground the helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials acknowledge that they are trying to succeed where more 
powerful cities and politicians failed four years ago, when helicopters 
blanketed 500 square miles of Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties with 
malathion-laced corn syrup bait for more than 100 nights. Hundreds of people 
complained of rashes, respiratory problems and other maladies. 
</P>
<P>
 But citing post-spray medical monitoring and tests, the state concluded that 
malathion -- the most common and among the gentlest of household and garden 
insecticides -- could not be blamed for wholesale medical complaints. At most, 
it was responsible for relatively few, short-lived incidents of rashes and 
other minor problems, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, agricultural officials said afterward that they hoped never to 
have to resort to aerial spraying again. 
</P>
<P>
 With the steady return of Medflies in the Los Angeles Basin since 1991, state 
officials have relied on manual, ground spraying of malathion and the release 
of sterile Medflies. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has not worked. On Jan. 13, Voss announced that the Medfly 
quarantine area in the greater Los Angeles Basin was being increased to 1,461 
square miles, encompassing much of Los Angeles County and reaching farther into 
Orange and San Bernardino counties because the number of trapped Medflies kept 
rising. 
</P>
<P>
 To battle the Medflies in the basin, the state said it will release nearly 500 
million sterile Medflies every week for 22 months, starting in March, in a 
strategy they hope will doom the species locally. 
</P>
<P>
 But the laboratories in Hawaii supply only enough sterile Medflies to release 
in Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Orange counties, Voss said. To kill the 
Medflies over the 18-square-mile area in Corona and parts of Norco, officials 
have no choice but to spray malathion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials bristled at not getting notice of the announcement and felt 
that they had been dismissed as outside the political decision-making loop. 
Community activists mobilized to fight the aerial spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 At a public meeting last Monday to discuss the spraying, state officials were 
shouted down. On Tuesday, the Corona City Council voted 5-0 to sue the state. 
On Thursday, a public demonstration was staged at the local library. 
</P>
<P>
 Malathion opponents have enlisted the support of state Sen. Ruben S. Ayala 
(D-Chino), longtime veteran of the agriculture and water resources committee. 
Citing "ambiguities" in a 1991 scientific review of the effect of malathion, 
Ayala wrote Gov. Pete Wilson on Wednesday that he is unconditionally opposed to 
using malathion until there is no longer any doubt about its safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to sound hasty and say, 'To heck with the crops,' " Ayala said 
Friday. "But if it's between crops and health, nothing is as important as 
health. We should sacrifice the crops." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the broader political and public health questions, local critics 
argued that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Helicopters will spook the 14,000 horses and other livestock in the zone. 
(Food and Agriculture Department spokesman Carl DeWing suggests that they be 
tethered, hobbled or otherwise restrained during the quick flyovers.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Malathion will stick to corral fences and lure livestock to lick the 
insecticide. (DeWing says an animal would have to lick more than two miles of 
fence before it might be affected.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Spraying should be conducted after midnight -- after children and adults are 
home and inside. (Based on the 1989-90 experience, DeWing says noisy 
post-midnight helicopter flights would create an even greater public outcry.) 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the opposition, California Department of Food and Agriculture 
officials, with the blessing of the state Department of Health Services and 
Cal/EPA, say they are committed to the aerial spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 A key element in the debate is the 1991 report by an independent, scientific 
review panel set up by Wilson. The panel concluded that malathion was generally 
effective and safe. But the report also called for further research, especially 
on its long-term effects, and said that aerial spraying of malathion should 
only be considered as a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, that moment has come, the state has said. 
</P>
<P>
 Agriculture officials are making some concessions this time. The spray mixture 
will contain only 10% malathion, and 90% bait -- half the amount of insecticide 
used in 1989-90. The lower dose is effective, yet doubles the margin of public 
safety, said Veda Federighi, spokeswoman for the state Department of Pesticide 
Regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the local political opposition, Wilson is not expected to block 
spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agriculture industry is so important to California's economy that the 
only thing a prudent governor can do is make a decision based solely on the 
science," said George Gorton, manager of Wilson's reelection campaign. "And 
that's what he has done. The science in this case says you've got to spray." 
</P>
<P>
 Norco officials suggest that instead of spraying, a fraction of the sterile 
Medflies headed for the Los Angeles quarantine area be diverted to their 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 But DeWing said the margin of sterile Medflies necessary to do the job in the 
larger quarantine area is dangerously slim, and none can be spared for Corona.

NEWS ANALYSIS; CANDIDATES' STYLES SET TONE FOR GUBERNATORIAL RACE; POLITICS: 
PETE WILSON PROJECTS IMAGE OF GRITTY FIGHTER, KATHLEEN BROWN SEEMS METHODICAL 
BUT TOUGH, AND JOHN GARAMENDI SHAPES UP AS THE BULL IN THE CHINA SHOP OF 
GOVERNMENT-AS-USUAL.

<P>
 Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and Democratic challengers Kathleen Brown and John 
Garamendi appear to have set the tone for the 1994 campaign for governor before 
any of them has formally announced as a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual three-way forum in Burlingame over the weekend, the three seemed 
to come across to an audience of schoolteacher union representatives in the 
same fashion they are known to political insiders. In a nutshell, each 
projected these political personae: 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson -- The gritty fighter holding the line against big spenders and higher 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown -- Cool and tough, but smart, the developer of well-considered programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi -- The risk-taker who wants California to get on with solving its 
problems. Now. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, 60, is tough -- tight-lipped tough. He is the guy who has had to steer 
California through stormy waters, and the victim of circumstances: the 
recession, massive illegal immigration and a string of disasters that have 
compounded California's fiscal woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Adversity has forced Wilson to put on hold his 1990 vision: preventive 
government programs such as early school health screening that cost money now 
but would save California millions down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look forward to a second term when California has experienced the kind of 
economic recovery that will allow us to give the sort of resources that we have 
been unable to give in the past," he told the governing body of the California 
Teachers Assn. on Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 So for now, Wilson is tough: tough on budgets, tough on the idea of anymore 
new taxes, tough on illegal immigration, tough on criminals. Looking younger 
than his 60 years, he governs somewhat like he used to play as a 150-pound 
guard on his high school football team: head down, teeth clenched, plugging 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 State Treasurer Brown, 48, has become the candidate of position papers: a 
13-point plan on education, 33 points on crime and, some say, more than 50 
points in an economic program she is scheduled to unveil in a speech in San 
Francisco on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, when she was considered by many as the overwhelming favorite for 
the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in the primary this June, and was 
raising massive amounts of money for her campaign, friends were concerned that 
Brown's record was an empty slate, except for esoteric dealings with state bond 
issues and short-term notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was polished. She acted gubernatorial, they said, and was adept at 
projecting a revival of the progressive vision of California put forth by her 
father, Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, when he was governor in the 1960s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 But these supporters said Brown needed to venture out and tell people what she 
stood for in terms of the major problems facing California. She has done that 
in-depth, at the risk of some ribbing and sniping from opponents that her 
position papers sound a little like high school term papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Brown is a far more cerebral and controlled politician than Pat Brown, 
the Irish pol and doer from San Francisco. She likes to say her programs are 
tough, but smart, as demanded by the changed nature of the California dream in 
the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 Accustomed to dealing with bond brokers and financial wizards in her first 
term in state office, Brown sought to connect with teachers by expressing her 
frustration in dealing with the Los Angeles school board as a mother and 
would-be activist in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 She had never planned to go into politics, she said, but in butting heads with 
the Board of Education, "I guess that sleeping giant woke up in me. I knew 
there was much to be done." She ran for the school board and won. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is John Garamendi, who will turn 49 on Saturday, the day he 
formally announces for governor. He is winding up a single term as the state's 
first elected insurance commissioner, the man who has portrayed himself as the 
consumer's advocate in dealing with giants such as State Farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, a veteran of two decades in the Legislature, can discourse 
extemporaneously on virtually any state program enacted in that time, and often 
will volunteer that he had some hand in crafting it. He is a policy wonk turned 
populist who is campaigning around the state by working with "real people" -- 
sawmill hands in Yreka and El Dorado County, cops in Crescent City, teachers in 
Modoc County and sulfur-breathing auto battery manufacturers in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the sort of campaign tactic often undertaken by the underfunded, or 
the underdog who needs the free publicity, but Garamendi does it whether the 
cameras are there or not, and seems to enjoy himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi demonstrated Saturday that he is the risk-taker of the crowd, the 
challenger who promises -- or threatens -- to be the bull in the china shop of 
government-as-usual, or, for that matter, within the Brown-leaning Democratic 
Party Establishment. Ultimately he might come across to voters as the candidate 
of action. His opponents are likely to portray him as an ambitious grandstander 
who leaps without looking. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson and Brown staffs both passed around prepared handouts at the 
teachers union forum. Wilson listed his education accomplishments of his first 
three years in one packet and his proposals in another. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown gave out her 13-page, 13-point education plan. "I am the only candidate 
to set down an education plan on paper," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no handouts from Garamendi. He tends to wing it. Act now, he said. 
Californians should not wring their hands waiting for others to come in and 
help, should not beg the feds for earthquake aid before committing themselves 
to action. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said: "The issue is today. If we fail today to find the leadership 
to rebuild, how can any one of us stand up here and tell you that tomorrow -- 
that tomorrow -- I will make the necessary proposals?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't work," he said. "It does not work." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Brown nor Wilson would buy that approach, involving new state sales or 
gasoline taxes, or both. 
</P>
<P>
 Premature, said Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Premature, said Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 The events of January may have little to do with how voters decide to cast 
their ballots in the primary in June, or the general election in November. 
Issues come and go. There almost always is some dramatic event in a campaign 
that can alter its nature. 
</P>
<P>
 But experts say that intangible factors such as style, character and trust 
often are as important as issues in determining how people vote. In that sense, 
the teachers in Burlingame on Saturday probably got a good sneak preview of the 
nature of the 1994 campaign.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: PEOPLE WANT ACTION, NOT MORE CAUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid all the preening, posing and posturing at photo ops, Sacramento's 
politicians have been taking some distinctive positions on earthquake recovery. 
Most stands are cautious, but a few are courageous. 
</P>
<P>
 Some pols have been provocative; others seemingly passive. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching "briefings," interviews and viewer call-ins on television, for 
example, it has been difficult to ascertain exactly how Gov. Pete Wilson 
intends to lead state government's rebuilding effort. Glum-faced in his 
green/blue parka, he appeared to be sleepwalking last week from one TV camera 
to another. He often resembled an uncomfortable man at a funeral, feeling he 
should be there but not quite sure what to say to the devastated family. 
</P>
<P>
 Observed one well-placed Capitol Republican: "He sounds like a Caltrans 
engineer: 'You're going to have to find alternate routes . . .' I already know 
that. I want to hear that he's going to fix it. I don't even care how he's 
going to fix it. He ought to be saying, 'I'm gonna kick butt and get you back 
on your feet.' " 
</P>
<P>
 By week's end, the governor did declare, unemotionally, that "we simply will 
not tolerate any bureaucratic delays." And he announced some immediate relief 
steps: bridge loan guarantees for small businesses awaiting federal funds, 
suspension of overtime rules to allow for more flexible workhours and plans for 
one-stop permitting in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But he still was waiting to find out "the total magnitude" and "precisely what 
it is we're going to be required to do" before deciding whether taxes should be 
raised temporarily to help finance repairs. "The Legislature will have time to 
act," he insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) was seeing it differently. 
Delaying legislative action, he said, "makes it more difficult because, little 
by little, you lose the energy that comes from the tragedy." Ultimately, he 
warned "you create gridlock." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-San Jose), chairman of the previously obscure 
Committee on Earthquake Preparedness and Natural Disasters, predicted from 
experience: "There'll be a window of opportunity to get things done. After 
that, the politicians and the press will move on to other crises." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Wilson's non-position on a tax increase was shared by Treasurer 
Kathleen Brown, one of his Democratic rivals for reelection. Both the extent of 
damage and federal aid should be determined before state taxes are considered, 
she said. "We don't want to do anything to minimize federal match by moving too 
precipitously. I'd rather have the feds pick up the tab than our taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 It's fantasy, however, to envision the feds picking up the entire tab -- 
estimated "conservatively" by Wilson at more than $30 billion. Inevitably, 
state and local governments will have to pony up a few billion of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasurer Brown does have some specific ideas involving "tools at our 
immediate disposal" in her office. She wants to spend $237 million from an old 
earthquake safety bond issue. The money is still there, she said, because the 
Wilson Administration has "failed to identify projects." Additionally, she is 
prepared to loan school districts up to $1 billion from the state's investment 
fund. She also is looking into bridge loans for small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The award for courage goes to Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, the other 
Democratic candidate for governor. I saw him on C-SPAN at the briefing 
conducted for President Clinton. After searching wildly for a microphone and 
finally grabbing one off the head table, he was standing awkwardly with his 
back to the camera assuring the President that "Californians are prepared to 
sacrifice . . . whatever it takes." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, I called and asked whether he was alluding to the dreaded "T" word. He 
was. 
</P>
<P>
 "We simply have to rebuild," Garamendi asserted. "It is imperative for the 
spirit of California and it is imperative for the economy. A failure in 
rebuilding will break the back of both the spirit and the economy and lead to 
the state's eventual destruction. There exists in California the preliminary 
signs of that destruction and we simply must intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to do this we have to sacrifice and we have to pay. We need to 
immediately raise the revenues. If that means going to a higher sales tax, a 
higher gas tax, we must do it." 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, he continued, "we did it on the cheap; 
nickle-dimed it. Anytime you try to get by on the cheap you're asking for 
trouble. We just simply cannot allow a repeat of the five-year wait for repairs 
that San Francisco has had." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi thinks the anonymous Republican has it right: People want it fixed 
and don't much care how.

 From a small Korean Presbyterian congregation in Sylmar to a Jewish synagogue 
in mid-town Los Angeles and Catholic Masses in Santa Monica, the question among 
earthquake-shaken worshipers was the same: If there is a God, why does God 
condone human misery and suffering? Why do bad things happen to good people? 
</P>
<P>
 "The freezing, the floods, the fires. God's telling us something," Terry 
Lopez, 40, declared from under a tarp outside Santa Rosa Catholic Church in San 
Fernando, one of three damaged churches where Cardinal Roger M. Mahony 
celebrated Mass on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez is not alone in his thoughts. The cataclysms visited upon Southern 
California in the last several years -- wildfires, riots, mudslides, drought 
and now earthquakes -- can seem almost biblical in their dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the week since the 6.6 temblor that killed 55 people and caused untold 
suffering, callers on radio talk shows and hosts on late-night national 
television, among others, have offered ideas on what God had in mind, some more 
serious than others. 
</P>
<P>
 Comedian Jay Leno, on NBC's "Tonight Show" on Wednesday night, mimicked God 
holding Los Angeles in the palm of his hand, shaking it violently and 
demanding: "They're still making those porno films in L.A.?" God, Leno quipped, 
must be angry. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Los Angeles -- long celebrated and denounced for its sometimes wicked 
lifestyles -- reeling from the wrath of God? 
</P>
<P>
 Clergy -- Protestant, Catholic, Jewish and Muslim -- were nearly unanimous in 
not blaming God for the earthquake. Many, but not all, were hesitant to call it 
judgment from on high. 
</P>
<P>
 Religious broadcaster Pat Robertson said during a fund-raising telethon for 
his "700 Club" that "it isn't coincidental" that there have been Midwest 
floods, Florida hurricanes and California earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesman Gene Kapp said later that Robertson believes God may be lifting His 
"hand of protection" over the United States ". . . to get our attention, for us 
as a nation to repent and pay attention to his word." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mahony, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Los Angeles, demurred. "I don't 
think God deals with us like that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In houses of worship throughout Los Angeles this weekend, the message was much 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
 At Wilshire Boulevard Temple on Saturday, Rabbi Harvey J. Fields repudiated 
unnamed Christian fundamentalist preachers that he said were from the "Los 
Angeles had it coming" school. 
</P>
<P>
 "They claim Los Angeles is a modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah," Fields boomed 
from the pulpit of the Reform synagogue, where 180 congregants came for Shabbat 
services. "And God's finger of judgment has brought all this destruction upon 
us . . . to shock us into repentance. . . . Such a notion makes of God a 
monster, a force not for good but evil, a power that picks out tiny babies and 
old innocent women and deliberately bashes in their skulls." 
</P>
<P>
 At the 8,000-member Church on the Way in Van Nuys, one of the largest 
congregations affiliated with the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel 
denomination, Pastor Jack W. Hayford gently admonished well-meaning Christians 
who saw the quake as God's judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to callers on a radio talk show, Hayford said to several thousand 
members Sunday: "Almost nobody says anything that has anything of light to it, 
including believers who defend God. 
</P>
<P>
 "God isn't responsible for pain. He didn't collapse an apartment house and 
kill 16 people. He didn't collapse a freeway so that a motorcycle officer could 
drive off," Hayford said, referring to fatalities in last Monday's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayford blamed the quake on the "fallen state" of the world. He said that 
before sin entered the world, everything about God's creation -- both humans 
and the physical planet -- was perfect. He held that it was only when God gave 
man responsibility for the planet and he fell into sin that both humans and the 
planet itself became broken. 
</P>
<P>
 Suffering and pain result from the fall, not from God's will, Hayford said. 
</P>
<P>
 At All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena, the Rev. George Regas said before 
services Sunday: "It is really important for people not to lay upon God what 
happens in such tragic ways to us. . . . I feel deep within me that in a tragic 
moment the first heart to break is God's heart." 
</P>
<P>
 But if God did not cause the earthquake, can God use it for good? Clergy and 
various church members interviewed Sunday said that God can. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's God trying to get us to reflect on what we've done, how we act. We are 
all sinners. It's a signal he's sending us," Luz Efelia Diaz, 37, said standing 
outside Mary Immaculate Church in Pacoima, where 3,700 followers packed the 
first two Masses of the day -- double the usual attendance. Heavily damaged in 
the quake, the church entrance was cordoned off and a statue of the Virgin Mary 
lay toppled. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sylmar, about 200 college-age Korean Americans crowded into the 22 pews of 
Valley Korean Community Church, where the sanctuary ceiling was cracked from 
the quake. John Koh, the 27-year-old pastor, made no attempt to explain why the 
quake struck but prevailed on his young congregants to look for the good that 
may come out of the disaster, such as drawing closer to one's neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene Cho, 21, a student at Occidental College attending the church in 
Sylmar, said: "I was just humbled by the experience. It just puts into 
perspective who God is, how powerful he is and how little I am. It just reminds 
me that Jesus is going to return soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Maher Hathout, chairman of the Islamic Center of Southern California, said 
Muslims look at natural disasters not as God's punishment, but as a test. "The 
feeling of Muslims is that with every difficulty there is a test. And with 
every difficulty there is some kind of mercy in disguise. It may bring out the 
best in people, the best in the community, and remind people of their 
limitations and the unlimited power of God that is embedded in nature," Hathout 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At quake-damaged St. Stephen's Episcopal Church on Old Orchard Road in 
Valencia, the Rev. Lynn Jay said asking why God caused the earthquake was the 
wrong question. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a better theological question to ask is, 'What now am I required to 
do because of this?' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than fine theological points, getting help and assistance to others in 
need was the message stressed in pulpits across the city, from quake-battered 
St. Monica's Catholic Church in Santa Monica, where tearful parishioners 
observed Mass before a makeshift altar in the church school gymnasium, to St. 
James Presbyterian Church in Tarzana, another sanctuary that sustained severe 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Many also said disasters can be a time to reconsider what is important in 
life. "For the first time in 100 years," said the Rev. Jess Moody, senior 
pastor at Shepherd of the Hills Church, a 6,000-member Southern Baptist 
affiliate in Porter Ranch, "Los Angeles has had a great divorce (from) 
materialism." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric A. Thomas, pastor of Christ Community Church in Canoga Park, no more than 
two miles from the epicenter, said before Sunday services, "I think the people 
that have suffered loss have all walked out of their apartments (and homes), 
over the glass and litter, and said, 'Thank God I'm safe,' " he said before the 
sermon. "Someone inevitably says, 'What did you lose?' and they inevitably say, 
'It's not important.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But if clergy were relatively certain that God was not to blame for the quake, 
they were more hard pressed to explain why some die while others are spared. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not know why these tragedies happen," evangelist Billy Graham said in a 
statement issued immediately after the Los Angeles earthquake. "But we know 
that he can use what has happened as a result of this disaster to bring people 
closer to him and closer to one another," Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme of togetherness also resonated with the Rev. Cecil A. Murray of 
First African Methodist Episcopal Church, a leading congregation in the African 
American community, where 2,000 packed the sanctuary for Sunday services. 
</P>
<P>
 "As devastating as Mother Nature is, it's not half as devastating as human 
nature," Murray intoned. "Mother Nature is an equal-opportunity employer -- 
Mother Nature visited Beverly Hills, Mother Nature visited Imperial Gardens. 
Mother Nature has no respect over humans. Human nature plays favorites. That's 
why divine nature seems to bring a message to us out of this act of Mother 
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "Divine nature," Murray concluded, "says that you are all shook up -- the 
person from Beverly Hills and the person from Imperial Gardens. The red, 
yellow, black, white, the Christian, the Muslim, the Jew -- you are all put on 
this thing together, and you're all shook up together."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; TEMPLE IS TEMPORARY HOME TO BAPTIST CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is not every day that people pray to Jesus Christ from the pulpit of Temple 
Israel. But it is not every day that the Messiah -- the Messiah Baptist Church, 
that is -- needs temporary shelter because of a natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 If calamity brings people together, nowhere was it more evident than in the 
chapel of the Jewish congregation in Hollywood, where 150 members of the 
Southwest Los Angeles African American church found refuge on a sunny Sunday 
morning to conduct their weekly services. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocked by Monday's earthquake, which caused lightning-shaped cracks in the 
church's bell tower and inner support columns, Messiah parishioners were 
welcomed with open arms by Temple Israel, with which they have had a covenant 
relationship for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 As a 16-member gospel choir belted out a rollicking version of "Oh Happy Day" 
in front of the holy ark, the eternal light and the tablets -- in Hebrew -- of 
the Ten Commandments, a smattering of yarmulkes could be seen swaying in time 
with the gold and fuchsia hats of elderly black congregants. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time in Temple Israel's history that we have welcomed a 
church to pray to Jesus Christ in our synagogue," said Senior Rabbi John L. 
Rosove. "It's wild. But we have a real sense of community with Messiah. And we 
feel very grateful we're able to reach out." 
</P>
<P>
 Messiah Rev. Kenneth J. Flowers, who has preached at the temple several times 
-- the latest at a joint Martin Luther King Day celebration last week -- said 
he also felt at home with the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wherever I pray," he said after the conclusion of the 2 1/2-hour service, "I 
get the fire in my bones." 
</P>
<P>
 Messiah Baptist, one of several major African American churches and community 
institutions in Southwest Los Angeles to suffer crippling damage in the quake, 
is expected to be closed anywhere from three months to a year while repairs are 
made. In the meantime, it has been offered nearly unlimited use of the Jewish 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Flowers said because of the distance from the Crenshaw district, 
Messiah will probably set up shop temporarily at a location closer to home. 
Next Sunday, he said, services will likely be held in a Southwest Los Angeles 
elementary school or the sanctuary of Angelus Funeral Home. 
</P>
<P>
 At Temple Israel, where many Messiah members arrived in a church bus, 
earthquake damage was limited to a fallen chandelier in the main sanctuary -- 
shuttering it temporarily until the remaining light fixtures are reinforced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our structure is strong," said Rosove, shortly before the church choir sang 
"The Solid Rock." "We're literally on a rock here." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosove drew shouts of "Praise the Lord" when, in opening remarks, he told the 
Messiah congregants: "If you need a place to worship, Temple Israel is your 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 But in a sanctuary where the sermons rarely threaten to blow out the speaker 
system, Flowers delivered a particularly passionate message, based, fittingly, 
on a passage from the Old Testament. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many have turned away from God, so many have turned their backs on God," 
said Flowers in rhythmic cadence. "The Lord has sent us a natural disaster to 
bring us back together." 
</P>
<P>
 That message was not lost on anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what the Lord has planned for us to do," said Erma Jean Carter, who 
runs Messiah's nursery school program. "He wants us to be aware we are brothers 
and sisters, regardless of our race and religious affiliations." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Green, a Temple Israel member who danced in the aisles as the 
white-and-red-robed choir sang of Jesus washing sins away, said he couldn't 
agree more. "This," declared the retired shoe salesman, "brings us all 
together."

earthquake: 
</P>
<P>
 * DEATHS: Coroner's report is 55. 
</P>
<P>
 * AFTERSHOCKS: Sunday at 12:55 a.m., the region was rattled by a 4.0 temblor, 
and a 4.5 at 8:15 p.m. Nine other tremors greater than magnitude 3.0 shook 
residents in the 24 hours ending Sunday evening. Since Monday, scientists have 
recorded 1,500 aftershocks, 271 of which were between 3.0 and 3.9 magnitude, 32 
between 4.0 and 4.9, and two between 5.0 and 5.3 
</P>

dwelling units, were declared uninhabitable, totaling an estimated $793 million 
in damage 
</P>
<P>
 * INJURIES: More than 7,315 people have been treated and released at 
hospitals; about 1,454 were admitted for care 
</P>
<P>

GUNMEN KILL 33 REVELERS AT STREET PARTY IN COLOMBIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gunmen believed to be leftist rebels fired automatic weapons at revelers at an 
early morning street party Sunday, killing at least 33 people and wounding 
eight, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The massacre in Apartado, a poverty-stricken town of wood-plank shacks and 
cement storefronts 300 miles northwest of Bogota, was the bloodiest in Colombia 
in more than five years.It was unclear if the attack was politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities interviewed on local radio said 35 people were killed. But morgue 
officials said they counted the bodies of 32 men and one woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Apartado denied earlier reports that the massacre occurred at the 
site of a political rally. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the rally of the Hope, Peace and Freedom Party, formed by former 
guerrillas, was held at a school half a mile away. They said gunmen attacked a 
street party held to raise money to send children to school.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK; BENTSEN'S WIT HITS PEAK AS HE TRAVERSES AN ECONOMIC CHASM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Communism and capitalism are intersecting in strange ways these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who completed a 12-day visit to Russia and 
Asia on Sunday, is the scion of a prominent Texas ranching family, a position 
in society that, just a few years ago, might have earned him a Mao Tse-tung 
epithet of Evil Landlord. But that did not stop him from citing a Chinese 
proverb frequently used by Mao himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The story involved Old Man Yu, who persuaded his family to move a mountain, 
shovelful by shovelful, because it was in his way. Despite the taunts of 
neighbors, their determination got the job done after several generations, 
proving that hard work can accomplish anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen's audience at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences giggled 
appreciatively -- whether in recognition of the proverb, or at the irony that 
the salesman of capitalism and the Great Helmsman of Chinese communism could 
find common ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporting on a meeting he held with Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, the Treasury 
secretary said they talked about free markets, how they work and the speed with 
which China is shedding its Communist economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said they were ready to go with a socialist market system," Bentsen said, 
adding wryly, "I told him we were ready to go with a capitalist market system." 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury secretary made the obligatory tour of Beijing's bustling shopping 
strip, Wang Fu Jing Street. 
</P>
<P>
 At the McDonald's on Changan Boulevard just off Tian An Men Square, he picked 
up a cup of coffee, smiled and shook some hands. He caused more of a fuss, he 
acknowledged, than when he first ran successfully for the U.S. Senate in Texas 
in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Was that man the laobang , the boss, of McDonald's? asked one of the young 
Chinese he greeted. No, came the reply, he is the U.S. Treasury secretary. Not 
quite as impressive.

AMERICAN ALBUM: GUN PLAY: A QUICK DRAW FOR FLORIDA TOURISTS; BUT CITY AND 
BUSINESS LEADERS THINK ORLANDO NEEDS GUN RANGES LIKE IT NEEDS A HOLE IN THE 
HEAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CLARY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a year in which Florida's image was bloodied by the brutal murders of 
several foreign visitors, tourism officials say the last thing the Sunshine 
State needs to start 1994 is a couple of shooting ranges where the whole family 
is invited to blast away with everything from a .44-caliber Magnum to an air 
gun that fires paint balls. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet here they are, in the heart of one of the most popular family vacation 
spots in the United States, boldly luring tourists who have time to kill 
between trips to nearby Disney World and Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy shooting, and this is getting very hard to do in the U.K.," said 
Kenneth Reid, 32, a tourist from Edinburgh, Scotland. Reid, a funeral director, 
was preparing to squeeze off a few rounds from a Colt revolver at Quick Shots, 
one of two shooting galleries that have opened here amid controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I think it's safe," Reid said. "My brother and I were deciding between 
driving those go-carts and coming here, and we decided this was safer." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Quick Shots and Shooting Sports opened last month in spite of opposition 
from city officials and business people who cater to tourists along 
International Drive, a crowded three-mile canyon of hotels, shops and fast-food 
franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police and businesses have resigned themselves to the fact that they are 
there," said Joe Mittiga, a spokesman for Orlando Mayor Glenda Hood. "But they 
are under close scrutiny." 
</P>
<P>
 The scrutiny, Mittiga said, is prompted by concerns that renting and selling 
weapons could promote violence. "The police are watching to see if people are 
loading guns in their cars, for example," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But another concern is the damage the gun ranges may do to the state's image 
and its $31-billion annual tourism industry. In the last 15 months, nine 
foreign tourists have been slain in Florida, and millions of dollars have been 
spent to counter the impression that a visit here could be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe these places are totally inappropriate in a family tourist 
corridor," said Cheryl Taubensee, executive director of the Central Florida 
Hotel and Motel Assn. "The ranges are not the problem; they may be safe. But 
it's the fact that we're encouraging violence and sale of guns in a tourist 
area." 
</P>
<P>
 The gun range operators insist that opponents just don't understand. Quick 
Shots manager Arvind Bissoondath said: "We knew from the beginning there would 
be objections, but it came down to providing entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Spielvogel, one of the owners of Shooting Sports, said that only 
"anti-gun persons or the very narrow-minded" object to the ranges -- or to the 
huge billboard, featuring a picture of a handgun, that his company has erected 
on busy Interstate 4. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting ranges are proving to be particularly popular with foreign 
visitors. "Here you have freedom of choice," said Reid, referring to the easy 
availability of both gun ranges and guns for sale in the United States. "We 
definitely don't have that at home." 
</P>
<P>
 After Quick Shots and Shooting Sports got building permits, Orlando changed 
its zoning laws to block any more ranges from opening. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the heels of some tragic shootings, and tourism industry complaints, we 
don't need more," Mittiga said. "And we doubt that a shooting range is an 
incentive for coming to Orlando." 
</P>
<P>
 Spielvogel, for one, says he sees nationwide franchise potential in 
family-atmosphere gun ranges, with special appeal to foreign visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tourist people are shooting themselves in the foot by making statements 
about what they see as a problem with shooting ranges," Spielvogel said. 
"Tourists are coming to us in droves, happy to find an alternative to Mickey 
Mouse." 
</P>
<P>
 The average Quick Shots customer spends $25 to $40 to rent a handgun and a 
lane, and to buy targets of a human silhouette and a box or two of ammunition, 
Bissoondath said. In a separate range, minors can shoot paint balls at moving 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Before renting a Magnum, a 9-millimeter Glock or a .38-caliber Smith & Wesson 
at Quick Shots, customers must fill out a form that asks, among other 
questions: Are you a fugitive from justice? Are you an unlawful user, or 
addicted, to narcotics? Have you ever been adjudicated mentally defective? 
</P>
<P>
 No one has ever answered yes to any of those questions. And Bissoondath is not 
surprised. "The people who do the killing, they use illegal guns, and they 
don't come to the range to practice. This is fun and safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Mittiga remains unconvinced. "The way the city looks at it, a shooting range 
is not an attraction, it's a place where you go to hone a skill in an activity 
that involves an element of danger and expertise. It is not an alternative to 
putt-putt golf."

 GATHERING STORM: Congressional liberals worry that conservatives now have the 
momentum to pass a balanced-budget amendment and a package of deep spending 
cuts that nearly carried in a raucous battle last fall. Approval of the two 
measures would keep liberals from replenishing social programs slashed under 
Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Key aides say that the new 
budget-cutting storm could also increase resentment over California's seemingly 
endless demands for disaster aid -- earthquakes on top of wildfires on top of 
floods on top of riots. . . . Democratic leaders have often bottled up the 
balanced-budget measure, but Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) 
has grudgingly agreed to permit a vote next month, and House Speaker Thomas S. 
Foley (D-Wash.) has promised to give the House a shot if the Senate approves 
the legislation. Senate sponsors claim that they have 60 of the 67 votes needed 
to prevail.

 STORM CONT'D.: Liberals face an even more pressing threat to their spending 
wishes: a bill named after Reps. Timothy J. Penny (D-Minn.) and John R. Kasich 
(R-Ohio) that would slash programs by $90 billion on top of the $255 billion in 
cuts enacted last August. The Penny-Kasich measure fell a few votes shy last 
October in the face of strong White House opposition. But a coalition of House 
Republicans and conservative Democrats is bringing it back, and GOP leaders 
believe that they can round up enough Republican strays to pass the measure 
this time. . . . Liberals hope that Clinton's expected austerity budget for 
1994-95 will curtail the gale winds propelling Penny-Kasich II.

 LOW NUMBERS: Bush used to say that he wasn't strong on "the vision thing," but 
it turns out that his White House also was astonishingly thin on the polling 
thing. Despite the widespread impression that Bush relied on polls to tell him 
what to do, Robert M. Teeter, his pollster and 1992 campaign manager, says that 
"polls had the least role in Bush's Administration of anyone since Dwight 
Eisenhower." . . . Teeter conducted only three national polls during Bush's 
first year in office, only three his second year and only one in 1991 (plus two 
special polls on the Persian Gulf War). Those numbers are extraordinarily low. 
Richard B. Wirthlin, Reagan's pollster, did 16 national surveys in Reagan's 
first year alone. . . . "Bush was curious" about polls, but then-Chief of Staff 
John H. Sununu believed that "polls were useless. . . . There was no one inside 
who used them at all," Teeter said. "It is simply symbolic of a lack of any 
political planning."

 SPLIT ON CRIME: Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun (D-Ill.) finds herself at odds with 
leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and officials 
of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People -- an unusual 
situation for the only African American member of the Senate. At issue is 
Moseley-Braun's sponsorship of an amendment to the Senate-passed crime bill 
that would allow children as young as 13 to be tried as adults if they are 
accused of certain violent crimes. . . . The proposal, which still must be 
considered by the House, was denounced as "inhumane" and "a return to the 19th 
Century" by witnesses at a forum sponsored by the Black Caucus. Moseley-Braun's 
rejoinder: "They're wrong. I'm right."

CHINA'S TRADE STATUS IN DOUBT, U.S. SAYS; HUMAN RIGHTS: SECRETARY OF STATE 
CHRISTOPHER DECLARES BEIJING'S RECENT GESTURES AND POSSIBLE PRISONER RELEASE 
STILL FALL SHORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the eve of talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher said Sunday that Beijing has not yet met conditions to 
renew its preferential trading status with the United States, despite recent 
gestures and unconfirmed reports of the possible imminent release of political 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher also cautioned against high expectations about the outcome of the 
U.S.-Chinese talks today. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have to decide right now. It's a yearlong test," he said during a 
press briefing. "At the present time they have not met the conditions of the 
executive order, but they were not intended to meet it by January." 
</P>
<P>
 China has until June to improve its human rights record, a precondition for 
renewal of the "most favored nation" trade and tariff benefits critical to its 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States accounts for about one-third of all Chinese exports. Without 
MFN status, tariffs would increase from an average of 8% to about 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 But Christopher suggested that a series of meetings between U.S. and Chinese 
officials is "a very positive sign." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is in the midst of a full-court press to convince 
China that it will refuse to renew MFN without progress on several human rights 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Those issues include ending exports produced by prison labor; freedom of 
emigration; release of, or accounting for, political prisoners; the free flow 
of radio and television broadcasts into China, and protection of the religious 
and cultural heritage of Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
 The session today will be the fourth meeting between Christopher and Qian 
since an Administration strategy of constructive engagement was launched six 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The next four months are widely considered critical in improving U.S.-Chinese 
relations, which have been rocky since Beijing's crackdown on dissent during 
the 1989 Tian An Men Square pro-democracy demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior official traveling with Christopher said that the strategy is 
beginning to show results, but he added: "I want to equally emphasize that 
there is a considerable distance to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the high visibility of the issue, China has not significantly softened 
one of the world's most hard-line policies on human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration fears Beijing believes Washington will buckle as the 
deadline approaches and not follow through on its trade threats. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Administration recently permitted the sale of three satellites to 
China, despite sanctions imposed last August after Beijing reportedly sold M-11 
missile technology to Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the senior U.S. official said, "the unity of the Congress and the 
President on this subject is unique. It is something that has not been seen in 
the past and I think the Chinese are beginning to understand that this is not 
something they can pretend is going to go away easily." 
</P>
<P>
 China has taken small steps in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Tibetan political prisoners were released earlier this month in the capital of 
Lhasa, an area of particularly ruthless control. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks are now underway with the Red Cross about visits to Chinese prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 And during the visit last week of Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, Beijing 
announced that it will allow U.S. Customs officials to inspect five prisons 
suspected of producing goods for export to the United States, in violation of 
U.S. law. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong television also reported Sunday that China may release Wang Juntao, 
a leading organizer of the Tian An Men Square demonstrations, and other 
political prisoners.

ARAFAT MEETS EGYPT'S LEADER TO TALK PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 PLO leader Yasser Arafat met Sunday with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to 
discuss ways to speed up the Middle East peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 After the session, chief PLO negotiator Nabil Shaath said his team will meet 
again Tuesday with Israeli delegates on the key issues that are delaying 
Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat was accompanied to the Mubarak meeting by several Palestine Liberation 
Organization negotiators. No one spoke to reporters after the 90-minute talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Sunday, Arafat left for Saudi Arabia on his first visit to the kingdom 
since relations were ruptured three years ago over his pro-Iraq policies during 
the Persian Gulf War. He was to make a stopover in Damascus to offer 
condolences to Syrian President Hafez Assad on the death of his son Basil in a 
car crash last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaath said the talks on such sticky issues as who will guard borders to 
Jordan and Egypt will resume Tuesday in the Egyptian resort of Taba. Separate 
talks on civilian issues will start today, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel is seeing progress in 
its talks with Palestinians, and he called on Assad to meet him "anyplace on 
Earth" to pursue a peace treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking before a group of American rabbis, Rabin was asked if he would meet 
with the Syrian leader personally to make peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am ready to meet President Assad in Damascus, in Jerusalem or anyplace on 
Earth," Rabin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Israel and Syria are hoping to break the stalemate over who should go 
first in moving toward peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel wants Syria to commit itself to open borders, an exchange of 
ambassadors and trade with the Jewish state. Syria wants Israel to declare it 
will withdraw from the entire Golan Heights captured in the Six-Day War of 
1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat's consultations with Mubarak, who often has served as a mediator in 
Middle East disputes, followed by one day a meeting between Arafat and Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres to try to resolve differences that have stalled 
Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arafat-Peres meeting was held in Oslo, where both men attended the funeral 
of Norwegian Foreign Minister Johan Jorgen Holst, who died Jan. 13 after two 
strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Holst was behind secret meetings that led to the historic Israel-PLO accord 
signed Sept. 13.

SYRIAN PRESIDENT ASSAD'S HARD SELL: PEACE; MIDEAST: FOR A QUARTER OF A CENTURY, 
THE DICTATOR HAS TAUGHT HIS PEOPLE TO HATE, FIGHT AND DESTROY ISRAEL. 
PERSUADING THEM TO EMBRACE PEACE MAY BE HIS TOUGHEST CHALLENGE OF ALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Four-year-old Faiz Suleimani was playing with his toy pistols, pretending to 
kill Israelis, when his president appeared recently on the television set in 
the family's sitting room with a historic message of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suleimanis had crowded around to hear it. Like millions of other Syrians, 
they were riveted to the set through the day, while Syrian leader Hafez Assad 
met with President Clinton in a marathon summit in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
 Their government had promised that the session would be a turning point in the 
quest for Mideast peace. And by nightfall on Jan. 16, Syria's tough military 
leader delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in a quarter of a century of emergency rule, Assad offered 
the possibility of peace to them and to Israel, a sworn enemy that, until that 
day, he had taught his people to hate, fight and destroy. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most Syrians, the Suleimanis were stunned. 
</P>
<P>
 True, they said, Assad's message brought new hope to a nation where many 
believe in only the vaguest concept of peace. For them, it was little more than 
a dream, this thought of life without costly armies and official states of war, 
a life free from poverty, international isolation and the need for 
authoritarian rule. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the Suleimanis and most of Syria's 14 million people -- an entire 
generation that has lived since birth under a dictatorship that justified 
itself for 24 years through the belligerence of a more-powerful neighbor -- 
embracing that peace is quite another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was like this kid, I had nightmares about the Israelis," explained 
Abdul Razak Suleimani, Faiz's 32-year-old uncle and a former Syrian army 
commando. "My mother said, 'Don't worry. When you grow up, the problem between 
Israel and Syria will be finished.' But then I grew up. I went into the army. I 
was shot in the leg. I watched many friends die. These are not easy things to 
forget." 
</P>
<P>
 In Assad's Syria, nothing is. It is one of the most highly structured, 
strictly controlled societies on the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, a sophisticated regime has employed propaganda, censorship and 
occasional imprisonment to teach its citizens what to think, where to go and 
how to behave. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, Syrian society has remained largely loyal, accepting almost 
universally the sacrifices that the regime has demanded. 
</P>
<P>
 In place of the freedoms it denied, Assad's leadership provided a quarter of a 
century of unbroken stability -- this in a land where coups, countercoups, 
rampant crime and bloodshed preceded the 1970 military coup that brought his 
regime to power. 
</P>
<P>
 And in exchange for mandatory military duty for all men and the vast military 
spending that has left much of the nation poor, Assad built an army strong 
enough to keep its enemies at bay. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the Suleimani family demonstrated on the day Assad offered a new era of 
peace, selling that prospect to his own people now may well be the Syrian 
leader's most difficult challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 He must do it at a time when the Syrians' expectations for economic and 
political reform are growing for the first time since he took power. 
</P>
<P>
 And to fulfill what Syrian and Western analysts say is among Assad's chief 
motivations to seek peace, the aging Syrian leader must do so in such a way 
that he retains enough power to install a hand-chosen successor; until he was 
killed in a car accident Friday, most believe that individual was the eldest of 
Assad's four sons, Basil. 
</P>
<P>
 The regime insists that selling the peace to the Syrian masses, to simple 
families such as the Suleimanis, will be no more difficult than it has been to 
motivate them for war. Like everything else, it will flow from Assad's 
universally acknowledged cunning and calculation. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, Israel must withdraw from every inch of the Golan Heights," said 
Mohammed Salman, Assad's information minister, referring to the strategic 
plateau Israel has occupied since the 1967 War. "When Israel will withdraw from 
the occupied territories, certainly there will be some change for Syria." 
</P>
<P>
 The return of the Golan, Assad's key demand in return for his offer to 
negotiate peace with Israel, clearly is a goal both strategic and personal for 
Assad. 
</P>
<P>
 Assad was Syria's defense minister when the Israelis overran and occupied the 
Golan 27 years ago. And most veteran diplomats and Syrian intellectuals in 
Damascus said Assad is driven to recover the land before he dies. 
</P>
<P>
 But those same sources added that the issue of Assad's successor, combined 
with the Syrian leader's personal need to solve Syria's growing economic 
disparities and mounting fiscal woes in his final years of life, is at least as 
strong a motivator for peace as the Golan. 
</P>
<P>
 The most difficult of the problems Assad must attempt to solve is Syria's 
complex, often confounding national economy, which diplomats, intellectuals and 
families such as the Suleimanis said is inseparable from the issue of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Golan is Assad's emotional selling point for peace, the promise of 
prosperity is the practical one for his people. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of Syria's economic nightmare is its huge defense budget, Assad's 
massive spending on a vast military-civilian security apparatus. Western 
diplomats say it consumes more than half the national budget. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years since the collapse of the Soviet Union -- which was Assad's 
longtime ally and supplied billions of dollars in military hardware and 
training -- Syria's defense costs have ballooned. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Syrians hope that the regime will reroute these sums into health, 
education and public services, many of which are strained by Syria's 
mushrooming population. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, electricity is strictly rationed in Damascus. Hospitals and schools 
are overcrowded; basic government services are plagued by long delays. 
</P>
<P>
 Syria has one of the world's highest population growth rates; its population 
is expected to double in just 20 years, draining the public sector even more 
and threatening any regime that attempts to manage it. 
</P>
<P>
 These are demographic realities well-known to Assad, who sensed the imminent 
collapse of his Soviet benefactors and three years ago launched a bold 
initiative to strengthen Syria's small private sector, diplomats in Damascus 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assad's recent, historic peace offer came at a time when Western and Syrian 
economists say the regime has been walking a tightrope between its traditional, 
Soviet-style socialism -- which guarantees all basic needs of its people -- and 
its post-Soviet, free-market reform. 
</P>
<P>
 It came at a time when, most economists and intellectuals agreed, those 
reforms have created a growing disparity between rich and poor, dotting 
Damascus' gritty skyline with conspicuous new symbols of wealth that have 
served only to raise the ambitions of Syria's poorer masses. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day Assad offered Israel his olive branch, for example, there were few 
signs of the regime's liberalization policies in the lives of the Suleimanis. 
</P>
<P>
 In a downtown district where late-model Corvettes and $100,000 luxury sedans 
jostle with horse-drawn carts hauling gasoline through mounting traffic jams, 
the Suleimanis still drive the battered Pontiac Silver Streak the family bought 
new in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 Only through permanent peace, families such as the Suleimanis concluded, can 
that gap be bridged. 
</P>
<P>
 The regime is also gradually releasing some control over the nation's mass 
media and giving Syrians their first taste of the West. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two years, the regime has permitted hotels and foreign residents 
to install satellite dishes; American videotapes are now widely available in 
Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
 Information Minister Salman confirmed that these samplings of Western culture 
will become a feast of information later this year when the government offers 
cable television for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 But Salman insisted that the allure of the West and its open democracies will 
not turn the Syrians against their deeply entrenched government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, there is no kind of regime in the world that satisfies all," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the Syrian citizen knows well his country, his state and his government. 
The Syrian people are very organized. Every part of society is organized."

FOR SALE IN BRITAIN: BUNKER WITH A VIEW 
</P>

<P>
 With the Cold War over, Britain's Defense Ministry has put 21 underground 
bunkers up for sale, euphemistically calling them "small country estates with a 
view." 
</P>
<P>
 The bunkers, measuring 15 by 3 1/2 feet, were constructed to be manned by 
soldiers in the event of nuclear war. 
</P>
<P>
 Ministry officials say the bunkers could make ideal wine cellars, bases for 
camping or even ultra-quiet country retreats. 
</P>
<P>
 Many are situated in areas of natural beauty with lovely views, they said.

AS REFORM FALTERS, U.S. MAY SHIFT FOCUS TO EX-SOVIET STATES; RUSSIA: DEPARTURE 
OF REFORMERS FROM CABINET IS VIEWED AS SERIOUS. TREASURY SECRETARY BENTSEN 
ENCOURAGES MOSCOW TO STAY THE COURSE. 
</P>

 The United States may turn its attention away from Russia and more toward 
other former Soviet republics, senior U.S. officials said Sunday as they 
expressed discouragement over the departure of economic reformers from the new 
Cabinet of Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a shift would make Yeltsin's task of redrawing the Russian economy into a 
free-market system more difficult after 70 years of Communist rule, but it 
would underscore how seriously the United States views the realignment taking 
place in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials, traveling with Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen on his return 
from a 12-day visit to Russia and Asia, had been notably upbeat as they left 
Moscow eight days earlier at the end of President Clinton's meetings with 
Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 But the departures of Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar and Finance 
Minister Boris G. Fyodorov have left them deeply disappointed and uncertain 
about the course that Yeltsin's government will follow. 
</P>
<P>
 The shake-up occurred after nationalists and others seeking to slow down, or 
reverse, the redesign of the Russian economic system strengthened their hands 
after parliamentary elections Dec. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written statement issued Saturday night, Bentsen encouraged Russia to 
remain on the reform course. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia's economic future depends on the vigor with which it implements 
President Yeltsin's commitment to reform," he said. "I am troubled by some of 
the indications we are getting out of Russia. There is no way to have a healthy 
economy without controlling inflation, and no way to slow inflation without 
controlling budget deficits and credit growth." 
</P>
<P>
 The statement goes to the heart of the differences over the course that Russia 
should take: The United States and others advocating "shock therapy" are 
pressing Yeltsin to rein in those who would continue pumping out rubles to 
support failing, inefficient industries unable to survive without costly 
government support that is fueling inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen pointed out in his statement that the support offered to Russia by the 
international financial institutions "will depend on Russia taking credible 
measures to reduce inflation." 
</P>
<P>
 In Moscow, there were signs over the weekend that the message is getting 
through. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, who shaped the new Cabinet, met 
Saturday with Fyodorov and urged him to stay as finance minister. Fyodorov 
continued to insist on greater power to block inflationary government spending 
-- a condition Chernomyrdin has refused -- and said he would press his cause in 
a meeting with Yeltsin this week. 
</P>
<P>
 As his spokesman rejected "the mechanical transfer of Western economic methods 
to Russian soil," Chernomyrdin also telephoned Russia's representative at the 
International Monetary Fund in Washington to press for an IMF mission to Moscow 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia is counting on the IMF and the World Bank for loans and grants. The 
United States is committed to a two-year aid program valued at $4.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But any slackening in the plan to bring down inflation and impose strict 
standards on the economy to keep the privatization program on course will cause 
the IMF to retreat, a senior U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chernomyrdin is in a panic," said Swedish economist Anders Aslund, who 
resigned Friday as an adviser to the Russian government. "He realizes that all 
this Western money may dry up" unless reformers stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Another likely result of the reformers' departure, an official traveling with 
Bentsen said, would be a new attention on the former republics, which have 
complained that they are getting short shrift and are concerned that Russia 
will get too strong.

DEMOCRATS REASSERT NEED FOR HEALTH CARE REFORM; LEGISLATION: PARTY LEADERS 
REJECT GOP ARGUMENT THAT WELFARE AND CRIME ARE MORE PRESSING ISSUES. DOLE SAYS 
CLINTON PLAN WON'T FLY.

 Overhaul of the nation's health care system, including coverage for everyone, 
remains the goal this year despite Republican rumblings that it is not as 
important as crime and welfare reform, Democratic congressional leaders said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do have to act on health care reform," said Senate Majority Leader George 
J. Mitchell (D-Me.), who said health care and welfare reform can be passed this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas argued -- as he has on several 
occasions -- that Congress ought to scale back President Clinton's sweeping 
health care proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to get the vast programs that the President and Mrs. Clinton 
want," Dole predicted on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation." He said the Clinton plan 
amounts to "trying to shove something down the throat of the American people." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole said health care coverage for all Americans, an area on which Clinton has 
said he will not compromise, is still a goal, but he added: "You're not going 
to be able to legislate universal coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, also appearing on CBS, said that while various health care proposals 
will be considered, coverage for the 37 million Americans now without health 
insurance must be "the essential element" of any bill for it to be passed. 
</P>
<P>
 House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), meanwhile, rejected suggestions that 
health care reform is not as badly needed as refashioning the welfare system. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't any reason we can't work on both of them together," Foley said on 
ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell and Foley also said they expect passage early this year of a major 
crime bill that puts more police on the streets and provides more money for 
prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley discounted those who claim that there isn't a crisis in health care, 
citing among other things the sharp increases in medical costs in recent years 
and the fact that many Americans are without health care coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical costs totaled $75 billion in 1970, increased to $260 billion by 1980 
and jumped to $700 billion by 1990, Foley said. "Within a year, we're going to 
be spending over a trillion dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Republicans -- including Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, who appeared 
with Foley on ABC -- have argued that there isn't a health care crisis and say 
lawmakers should concentrate on welfare reform or legislation aimed at curbing 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Senate 
Finance Committee, also suggested that health care reform is not as pressing as 
the need to overhaul welfare. He suggested that he might bottle up health care 
legislation if welfare changes are not given the same priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said Sunday that he does not favor "holding one bill hostage to 
another."

PEROT SAYS HIS GROUP WILL INFLUENCE ALL '94 FEDERAL RACES; POLITICS: IN TV 
INTERVIEW, HE SPELLS OUT UNITED WE STAND AGENDA. HE ALSO ATTACKS CLINTON HEALTH 
PLAN, BUT MEMBERS HAVE YET TO CONSIDER IT. 
</P>

 Ross Perot pledged that his political organization will influence every 1994 
House and Senate race and said President Clinton's health care plan is "an 
airplane with no wings." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview broadcast Sunday, Perot said the agenda of his United We 
Stand, America, Inc. organization will be headed by calls for spending 
discipline, government reforms, campaign finance overhaul, term limits and a 
balanced budget amendment. The group's planning meeting isn't slated until next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Perot said it would be up to leaders of United We Stand state 
chapters whether to add health care. But later in the 45-minute C-SPAN 
interview, he delivered a lengthy criticism of the Clinton plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Perot also renewed his charge that Clinton had "opened the Treasury" to buy 
enough votes to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Perot 
vehemently opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 While Perot's standing in national polls fell sharply after NAFTA passed, the 
1992 independent presidential candidate said: "As far as grass-roots America is 
concerned, as far as our membership is concerned, it had no impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Perot said United We Stand now has leaders in every congressional district in 
the country and that the organization would sponsor issue forums and debates 
throughout the election year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our people will be very active in trying to get voter awareness and 
involvement in every race in the House of Representatives and every race in the 
Senate," Perot said in the interview, conducted in his hometown of Texarkana, 
Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Perot also renewed his 20-year claim that the government deliberately left 
Americans behind at the end of the Vietnam War and suggested that he had 
evidence that some were alive and being used for slave labor. 
</P>
<P>
 When pressed, he refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I say it, they will move them, but we have a pretty good idea where they 
are," Perot said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said "all should be accounted for" before the United States lifts its trade 
embargo against Vietnam. But Perot said there was a growing sentiment to "go 
ahead and recognize them and just write these men off." 
</P>
<P>
 Perot said his conversations with average Americans during his travels had 
convinced him that the public is deeply skeptical of the heavy government role 
in Clinton's health care plan. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his personal view was that the government should prove itself first by 
improving veterans hospitals and making needed reforms in Medicare and 
Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the organizational chart of Clinton's health care bureaucracy "makes 
the Pentagon look like a ballet dancer. That thing is designed to fail." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a system that needs dramatic improvement," Perot said. "But just 
turning it over to the federal government, with its history of mediocrity and 
failure in managing social programs and its total lack of discipline on 
spending when it comes to social programs . . . this is an airplane with no 
wings."

PERRY STILL IN RUNNING FOR DEFENSE JOB; PENTAGON: REPORTS OF DEPUTY DEFENSE 
SECRETARY'S MISGIVINGS HAD CIRCULATED. BUT A CLINTON SPOKESMAN SAYS HE 
'CONTINUES TO BE A CANDIDATE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The White House took the unusual step Sunday night of saying that William J. 
Perry was still in the running for secretary of defense after reports 
circulated that he had expressed misgivings about the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry is deputy secretary of defense and has been regarded as a front-runner 
for the top spot after nominee Bobby Ray Inman, a retired admiral, bowed out 
Tuesday with a blast at his critics. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Times, in its Monday editions, cited Pentagon officials as saying 
Perry told Thomas (Mack) McLarty, President Clinton's chief of staff, Saturday 
that he did not want the Cabinet post. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its embarrassment over Inman's abrupt withdrawal, the White 
House has also been told by two prominent defense experts, Sen. Sam Nunn 
(D-Ga.) and former Republican Sen. Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire, that they 
did not want to be considered for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 An Administration official, who asked not to be identified, said Perry had 
expressed some reservations but subsequently voiced "affirmative interest" in 
the high-profile post. 
</P>
<P>
 White House communications director Mark D. Gearan, taking the unusual step of 
talking about a candidate on the record, said Sunday night that Perry 
"continues to be a candidate. The President has not made up his mind at this 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 Gearan also told the New York Times that Perry was "very much in the running." 
</P>
<P>
 The paper said Vice President Al Gore had called Perry, a friend of long 
standing, to insist that he not let the Administration down. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry, 66, discussed the job Friday with the President but was not formally 
offered it then, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House forced Defense Secretary Les Aspin to announce his resignation 
last month. Aspin agreed to stay on until a successor was found. 
</P>
<P>
 Aspin's troubled tenure included controversies over the Clinton policy on gays 
in the military and the deaths of members of U.S. humanitarian forces in 
Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry is a respected military expert with a background in both academe and 
industry. He is credited with pushing the successful Stealth aviation 
technology on Air Force officials who resisted it in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry is reported to advocate the continued production of major weapons such 
as submarines, even when not needed, to preserve the military-industrial base 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Presidential spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said the search for a replacement for 
Inman was headed by McLarty, with assistance from Gore and National Security 
Adviser Anthony Lake.

 Former Vice President Dan Quayle spoke of family values to about 3,000 
religious conservatives, while 1,000 protesters outside called for tolerance 
and an end to bigotry.Addressing delegates to a three-day "Reclaim America for 
Christ" conference in Ft. Lauderdale, Quayle criticized rap music "that 
degrades women or advocates killing cops" and repeated his complaint that TV's 
"Murphy Brown" glorifies single mothers. The conference, aimed in part at 
helping Christians win elections, renewed questions about Quayle's future. He 
jokingly told reporters he thinks of running for President in 1996 "probably 
once or twice an hour."

PENTAGON QUITS AIDS DRUG TRIALS; MEDICINE: TOP HEALTH AGENCIES ALSO OPPOSED THE 
PROGRAM. FUNDS FROM THE CONTROVERSIAL $20-MILLION VACCINE TEST WILL GO TO 
UNSPECIFIED ARMY RESEARCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pentagon has scrapped plans to begin a third phase of clinical trials for 
an experimental AIDS vaccine, saying it was too soon to tell whether it was 
worth going ahead with the $20-million program, despite orders from Congress to 
conduct the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the decision was announced in a Jan. 4 letter from Edward D. 
Martin, acting assistant secretary of defense for health policy, to the 
National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration. Both 
agencies had opposed continuing the trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin's letter said the Defense Department would instead turn the $20 million 
over to the Army to conduct more broadly based research on acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not specify what the new research would entail, and officials said no 
firm decision had been made. 
</P>
<P>
 The program had been controversial almost from the start. Although the NIH and 
FDA both had recommended against conducting the trials so soon, MicroGeneSys, 
the Connecticut-based manufacturer of the vaccine, successfully lobbied 
Congress to mandate the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The vaccine, known as VaxSyn, is designed only to slow the progress of AIDS, 
not to prevent infection with the human immunodeficiency virus that causes the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug contains gp-160, which is made from fragments of the outer membrane 
of HIV in order to help attune patients' immune systems to the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Some researchers and AIDS activists had complained of political meddling in 
connection with the tests. Although the Defense Department has frequently 
conducted trials of drugs, the selection traditionally has been made by the NIH 
rather than Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin's letter was part of a package that also included recommendations by 
FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler and NIH Director Harold E. Varmus that the 
government not continue the trials involving a single drug. 
</P>
<P>
 An amendment to this past year's defense appropriation bill would have 
required the Pentagon to go ahead with the third phase of the trials unless the 
Defense Department, the NIH and the FDA all recommended against further 
testing.

TODAY, RAISING THE TOTAL TO 15.

 As aftershocks continued to ripple across the region Sunday, the Southland 
tried to get back to its feet, helped by a rainstorm that did not materialize 
but daunted by word that nearly 11,000 dwellings have been declared at least 
temporarily uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of housing units crippled by last Monday's 6.6 earthquake -- 10,961 
-- is "the equivalent of a small town," said Housing and Urban Development 
Secretary Henry G. Cisneros at a news briefing. And building and safety 
officials have still not completed their survey, the secretary noted. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the first voucher recipients -- an unemployed Hollywood janitor and 
his family -- moved into a rented home, and federal disaster officials 
announced that they had mailed 1,100 checks under that Federal Emergency 
Management Agency's program to provide temporary rental assistance for up to 
three months. The agency has taken 24,717 applications for the grants, FEMA 
Director James Lee Witt said. 
</P>
<P>
 To deal with the crush of applicants, FEMA plans to open two new disaster aid 
centers today -- bringing the number to 15. Five-hour waits were commonplace at 
some centers Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 As it struggled to regain its composure after an earthquake that left 55 dead 
and billions of dollars in damage, the Southland got a little help from the 
weather. A predicted rainstorm did not materialize, except for scattered 
sprinkles. 
</P>
<P>
 But further complicating efforts to get back to normal are Weatherdata Inc.'s 
predictions of a 70% chance of rain by this afternoon. "It looks like you'll 
get wet this time," said forecaster Bruce Thoren. A quarter-inch of rain at 
most is expected, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A cluster of morning and evening aftershocks rumbled like thunderclouds 
Sunday, the strongest a 4.5-magnitude temblor Sunday evening, followed just 
over 90 minutes later by quakes of 4.4 and 4.3. 
</P>
<P>
 No new damage was reported from the temblors -- three of them between midnight 
and 6 a.m., and four more between 6:30 p.m. and 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, weary disaster workers reported that the population of dozens of 
impromptu and worrisome park encampments, whose conditions had concerned health 
and public safety officials, continued to dwindle Sunday. Their inhabitants 
drifted back to their pre-quake dwellings or moved to shelters managed by the 
Red Cross and Salvation Army. At the peak, more than 20,000 persons were 
reportedly camping in city parks. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,300 people were still camping in the parks Sunday, according to Dick 
Andrews of the state Office of Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Department of Water and Power officials also had good news -- 
water service was restored to all but residents of Granada Hills by Sunday, the 
same day that state health officials said residents of North Hollywood, 
Panorama City, Sun Valley, Sunland-Tujunga and Van Nuys no longer needed to 
boil drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
 Also taken off the boiled-water order Sunday were parts of Studio City and 
Sherman Oaks, according to Pankaj Parekh, a DWP official. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet hundreds of thousands of DWP customers were still being told to boil their 
water as a precaution against contamination: all neighborhoods in the Santa 
Monica Mountains north of Sunset Boulevard, including Brentwood, Bel-Air and 
the Hollywood Hills, and parts of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the slow return to familiar rhythms and habits, the test of nerves was 
expected to continue today when the city braces for the heaviest commuting day 
since the quake. With some freeways severed by the earthquake, and the 
possibility of rain, the commute for many is expected to be grueling. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson predicted that the city's quake damage would outstrip the $18 
billion in destruction wrought in August, 1992, by Hurricane Andrew in the 
Southeast, making it the nation's costliest disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson resisted efforts to fix a price tag on the damage from the 
Northridge quake, saying that "it would be a great mistake to rush to judgment 
and give Congress a number that is less than the actual damage." 
</P>
<P>
 And in any case, Wilson added, he believes that the federal government should 
bear the brunt of the region's recovery costs. 
</P>
<P>
 With brush fires and mudslides on top of the recession and slumping aerospace 
industry, and now this latest calamity, Wilson said, "this area has been very 
hard hit, and has had more than its share." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am in no rush to raise state taxes and impose more costs on this state when 
we are already suffering," Wilson said. "The President said this is a national 
problem . . . just like the floods were in the Midwest." 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA director Witt agreed that the quake disaster was "probably the worst 
we've had in a long, long time."

LEE A. DUBRIDGE; LED CALTECH FOR 22 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lee A. DuBridge, president of Caltech for 22 years and science adviser to 
President Richard Nixon, died Sunday, Caltech officials said. He was 92. 
</P>
<P>
 DuBridge, who had retired to Laguna Hills, headed the Pasadena institution -- 
known for scientific education and research including space exploration -- from 
1946 until 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 He then worked for Nixon from early 1969 until shortly before his 69th 
birthday in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 In reluctantly accepting the resignation, Nixon praised DuBridge for his 
"skill, wisdom, and seasoned judgment," traits the scientist and administrator 
used throughout his career to apply science to overall human endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world is sorely in need of young men understanding the place of science 
in the world at large -- leaders who will see that science serves mankind 
rather than contributing to destruction," DuBridge said shortly after he was 
named Caltech president in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 His initial task was to move Caltech -- and himself -- from a World War II 
orientation of secret military projects toward fundamental scientific education 
and research. 
</P>
<P>
 As a nuclear physicist, DuBridge had supervised the construction and 
installation of an atom-smashing cyclotron, which soon produced the highest 
energy proton beam of the time, at the University of Rochester in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1940 to 1946, he headed the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
radiation laboratory set up by the National Defense Research Committee. The 
unit was then considered the largest research and development laboratory ever 
assembled and was credited with giving Allied forces supremacy in radar during 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 As scientist and administrator, DuBridge helped bring together science and 
government, setting the pattern for the Manhattan Project, which developed the 
atomic bomb. Much later, he played a role in space exploration by supervising 
the development of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for the new National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he stressed adapting atomic energy for peaceful purposes and saw little 
need for sending people into space. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I hope is that we don't let the glamour of the term 'space science' 
confuse us," he said in 1963. "There is a lot we can learn about the moon, for 
example, by just using earthbound astronomical telescopes. Let's not be seduced 
into sending expeditions to the moon just to look for things we can see 
perfectly well from Palomar Mountain." 
</P>
<P>
 A strong advocate of academic freedom even during the McCarthy era, DuBridge 
publicly spoke out on behalf of Caltech chemist Linus Pauling when he was 
denied a passport because of suspicion that he was a Communist, and on behalf 
of his nuclear physics colleague Robert Oppenheimer, whose security clearance 
concerning atomic information was revoked. 
</P>
<P>
 DuBridge adhered to a concept of Caltech as a small, select institution of 
excellence with carefully controlled growth. During his tenure, Caltech 
expanded from 30 acres to 90, a $17-million endowment to $100 million, 260 
faculty members to 550, 20 buildings to 64, and an $8-million budget to $30 
million. He supervised construction of the 200-inch Hale Telescope at Palomar 
as well as guiding the development of JPL. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally sought by Democratic and Republican administrations, DuBridge was 
named to the original national Science Advisory Committee by President Harry S. 
Truman in 1951, and made chairman a year later by President Dwight D. 
Eisenhower. He served on several other governmental advisory committees and as 
adviser to more than 20 private organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, DuBridge helped to found public television station KCET and to 
establish the California Museum of Science and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
 He had honorary degrees from 29 universities and colleges and earned more than 
20 professional awards, including the British King's Medal for Service in the

MORNING BRIEFING: THIS WASN'T WAKE-UP CALL THEY WANTED

 Last week's earthquake reminded hockey legend Emile Francis of the time in 
1971 when he was in Los Angeles as coach of the New York Rangers and he gave 
the team a dressing down before a game with the Kings. He told them that if 
they did not have a good road trip, he would shake up the team with a major 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, the next morning around 6 a.m. we had an earthquake," Francis, 67, 
recalled in a conversation with Jim Smith of Newsday. "The bed in the hotel was 
shaking. The chandelier was shaking -- for about 40 seconds. Later, when I saw 
(center) Pete Stemkowski, he said, 'Geez, you threatened us with a shakeup. You 
didn't have to order an earthquake.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who holds the Professional Bowling Assn. one-year record for 
earnings? 
</P>
<P>
 Rainbow Rodman: For real shock value, the sight of San Antonio forward Dennis 
Rodman earlier in the season -- a tall black man with a thatch of dyed blond 
hair on top of his head, the sides close-shaven -- remains unequaled. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point Rodman's hair was burgundy. Now he has short-cropped blue hair. 
The Knicks' Anthony Bonner likes it: "I think it's a nice touch -- if he has a 
blue suit to go with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodman has plans for yet another look if he makes the All-Star game. "If I get 
voted in I'm going to change it to green . . . loud green," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Different strokes: During the Qatar Open tennis tournament, when a signal 
sounded throughout the city of Doha, white-robed spectators stood up and left 
to pray. Later, they returned to their seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Miles, chief executive officer of the ATP Tour, told Ross Atkins of the 
Christian Science Monitor that the periodic mid-match departures were "a lot 
less disruptive than the planes flying overhead at Flushing Meadow," during the 
U.S. Open in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Right name: Richard Ace made a shot to match his name -- on the sixth hole of 
the Gulf Gate Country Club in Florida.

<P>
 Inflation: The original Stanley Cup, a silver bowl, cost $48.67 when it was 
purchased by Lord Stanley in 1893. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of the NFL champion's cup today is $85,000, according to Boffey, 
Inc. of Montreal, maker of the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 The way it is: The late Chub Feeney, former National League president, is 
remembered by San Francisco Examiner columnist Art Spander for his views on the 
designated hitter rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "We play the game in our league the way it was supposed to be played," Feeney 
told Spander. "With nine men."

 Trivia answer: Mike Aulby of Indianapolis, $298,237, in 1989.

TENNIS / AUSTRALIAN OPEN; DAVENPORT ADVANCES PAST FERNANDEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Monica Seles on the sidelines, 17-year-old Lindsay Davenport is becoming 
the new off-court jester of tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport, of Murrieta, Calif., laughed her way through a news conference 
Sunday after overcoming an attack of nervousness to defeat Mary Joe Fernandez, 
6-2, 6-7 (4-7), 6-2, and reach the quarterfinals of the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport won despite wasting four match points in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of weird and I don't know if I can explain this, but I was pretty 
relieved when it got to a third set," Davenport said. "In the second set, when 
it got close I got nervous and stopped going for my shots. But in the third set 
I felt better. I don't know. It sounds really weird." 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport has become a sensation for those looking for a new tennis 
personality in Seles' absence. The three-time champion is recovering from being 
stabbed in the back by a spectator in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport, who is 6 feet 2, has a laugh as robust as her booming serve and 
powerful ground strokes. She said part of the reason for her success is that 
she still enjoys tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I turned pro when I was 16 and I have only been doing it for a year," she 
said. "So maybe in two years I won't be smiling." 
</P>
<P>
 Then she laughed and blurted into a microphone: "No, that was a joke!" 
</P>
<P>
 In other women's matches, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario defeated Magdalena Maleeva 
and will next play her older sister, Manuela Maleeva-Fragniere, who defeated 
Sabine Hack in three sets. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriela Sabatini fell behind, 3-1, in her match against Mary Pierce but won 
seven consecutive games en route to a 6-3, 6-3 victory. Sabatini will play Jana 
Novotna. 
</P>
<P>
 In men's matches, two-time defending champion Jim Courier defeated Wayne 
Ferreira, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2, and will next face Goran Ivanisevic. Magnus Gustafsson 
will play Pete Sampras after defeating Martin Damm, 2-6, 6-3, 6-1, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Muster defeated Alexander Volkov, 6-3, 6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Stefan Edberg advanced to the quarterfinals with a 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 victory over 
Swedish compatriot Lars Jonsson in 97-degree heat Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the 10th consecutive year Edberg has reached the Australian Open 
quarterfinals.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Where is the Playoff Bowl when we really need it? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Steve Young and Joe Montana would be matched if the game that used to pair the 
NFL Western and Eastern Conference title-game losers was still around and 
involved the NFC and AFC runners-up. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, America will have to settle for Troy Aikman and Jim Kelly in a Super 
Bowl between the only two teams that belong there, the Dallas Cowboys and the 
Buffalo Bills. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Hey, some people probably didn't want to see the Brooklyn Dodgers play the New 
York Yankees in the World Series for the fifth time in nine years in 1955, 
either, but the Dodgers finally won the championship. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the Bills do their best work in the Super Bowl when they have only 
one week to worry about it. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Johnson's guarantee that the Cowboys would win sure got the 49ers' 
dander up. Otherwise, they probably would have lost by 40 points. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The inexperienced San Francisco defensive line, which had a fine day against 
the New York Giants after a shaky regular season, couldn't cope with the fierce 
Dallas blockers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It was nice to hear some good things about Leon Lett. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 So much for Thurman Thomas and Emmitt Smith being tired and banged up. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not even the Chiefs use Marcus Allen enough. It probably would have been a 
touchdown instead of an interception late in the second quarter if Montana had 
been throwing to Allen instead of Kimble Anders. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders didn't blitz enough against Buffalo.The Chiefs blitzed too much. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Bills' defensive coordinator Walt Corey and his swizzle stick got plenty of 
close-ups on the sidelines, but the terrific job by offensive coordinator Tom 
Bresnahan also should have been recognized. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In four AFC championship games, the Bills have outscored their opponents, 
120-33. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 How confident were the Bills that they would reach the Super Bowl again? Their 
media guide has a seating chart of the Georgia Dome. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 However, that same guide includes scoring summaries from every Buffalo 
postseason game in history except the 52-17 loss to Dallas in Super Bowl XXVII. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It had nothing to with the result of the game," a club public relations 
assistant said Sunday. "The page was left out because of a printing error and 
the mistake wasn't detected until it was too late." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I'm glad that we will again be able to hear Pat Summerall and John Madden, the 
best team ever to announce football. The only difference is that they will be 
on Channel 11 instead of Channel 2. Big deal. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Now comes the hardest part for UCLA. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Four college basketball teams have won and then lost the No. 1 ranking. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A difficult two-game road trip awaits the Bruins -- Thursday against Stanford 
and Sunday against California. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 However, they appear to be up to the challenge. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins could have been mentally and physically weary after their intense 
victory over Arizona at Pauley Pavilion Thursday, but they played their best 
down the stretch against Arizona State two days later. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I don't care about NBA potential or other extraneous factors. I want Tyus 
Edney as the point guard on my team. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The smallest Bruin was their biggest star last week, scoring 47 points and 
getting 14 assists in the two victories. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He picked apart highly regarded Damon Stoudamire Thursday and controlled the 
decisive final 10 minutes of the game. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the highest compliment that can be paid Edney is that he reminds 
veteran Pauley observers of Mike Warren, one of John Wooden's all-time 
favorites. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA-California game Sunday will be televised at 1 p.m., meaning that you 
can enjoy the action from the Oakland Coliseum Arena instead of being subjected 
to hours of Super Bowl pregame hype. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Against the Arizonas, USC showed that it lacks the arsenal to stay with good 
teams for 40 minutes. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brocco, the horse, got the same raw deal that Notre Dame, the football team, 
got in the polls. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Brocco beat Dehere easily when they met in the Breeders' Cup, but, aided by 
the Eastern bias, Dehere won the Eclipse Award for best 2-year-old male. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen a lot of Heisman Trophy winners who haven't made it in the NFL," 
said Brocco's trainer, Randy Winick. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "This one was for Jeff," jockey Pat Day said after riding Tabasco Cat, the 
horse who ran over assistant trainer Jeff Lukas, to victory in the $200,000 El 
Camino Real Derby Saturday at Bay Meadows. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The most underworked employees in New York last week were the penalty-box 
attendants at the NHL All-Star game. . . .  
</P>

 Super Bowl prediction: Dallas 31, Buffalo 17.

NBA ROUNDUP; WEATHERSPOON, WOOLRIDGE WITHSTAND THE KNICKS, 99-92 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it came time to make the crucial shots, Clarence Weatherspoon and Orlando 
Woolridge came through. 
</P>
<P>
 Weatherspoon and Woolridge each made a tough jump shot as the shot clock 
expired in the final 1:18 of the Philadelphia 76ers' 99-92 victory over the New 
York Knicks Sunday night at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Hornacek had 23 points, Tim Perry 18 and Weatherspoon 17 as the 76ers won 
at Madison Square Garden for the first time since March 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only the fifth home loss of the season for the Knicks, who were led by 
Patrick Ewing with 36 points and a season-high 21 rebounds. The Knicks scored 
only 15 points in the fourth quarter -- none in the final 3:30 -- and made only 
37% of their shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as good of a win as we've had all season long," 76er Coach Fred Carter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second loss in a row at home for the Knicks. John Starks had 20 
points and Charles Oakley had 14 points and eight rebounds, ending his streak 
of 16 consecutive games with at least 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The 76ers ended a four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks didn't trail from early in the first quarter until 8:35 remained, 
when Eric Leckner dunked to give the 76ers an 80-79 lead. The Knicks held a 
small lead for the next seven minutes, but Weatherspoon made consecutive shots 
from the corner -- the second with one second left on the shot clock -- to put 
the 76ers ahead, 93-92, with 1:18 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami 113, Washington 80 -- Glen Rice scored 17 of his 21 points in the first 
quarter and Steve Smith had a career-high 15 assists at Miami, ending the 
Heat's seven-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat Coach Kevin Loughery won his 600th game, and it came against the team he 
played for and once coached. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, averaging only 5.3 assists, had 12 by halftime and finished two short 
of the franchise mark of 17 set by Sherman Douglas in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The 33-point victory margin was the Heat's largest of the season.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; MICHIGAN'S HOWARD STARTS FROM SCRATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Fisher had a choice: Return Juwan Howard to the lineup or face the 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher bowed to Howard's wishes, and No. 15 Michigan defeated Illinois, 74-70, 
Sunday at Champaign, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, who sat out last Wednesday's game against Minnesota because of chicken 
pox, made two consecutive shots at the start of the game and finished with 20 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd have pounded on my head if I hadn't started him and continued to play 
him," said Fisher, whose team still is without Jimmy King, also suffering from 
chicken pox. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hopelessly beaten if we don't have Juwan in that game," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard was at his best in the first half, scoring 16 points as the Wolverines 
took a 20-point lead. He said he felt only 85%, but added that he "got on a 
good roll." 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, when Michigan (12-4, 4-2 Big Ten) wasted a 13-point lead, 
it was Jalen Rose who rescued the Wolverines after the Fighting Illini (10-4, 
3-2) seemed poised to take command. 
</P>
<P>
 After a free throw by T.J. Wheeler tied the score at 68 with 1:59 to play, 
Rose put Michigan ahead to stay with two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 A basket by Leon Derricks extended the lead to 72-68 before Rose made two more 
free throws with 12 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basketball is a game of runs," said Rose, who scored 28 points. "Once they 
cut our lead, we didn't let them get a sizable margin." 
</P>
<P>
 No. 11 Temple 78, Rutgers 56 -- Aaron McKie had a season-high 31 points and 
was five for seven from three-point range to lead Temple to its fifth 
consecutive victory at Piscataway, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 McKie had 18 points at halftime as the Owls (11-2, 4-1 Atlantic 10) took a 
46-28 lead. But the game became a struggle at the start of the second half as 
Rutgers (5-9, 1-4) -- which has lost seven of nine -- went on a 13-0 run to 
pull within 46-41 with 14:55 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 McKie, who also grabbed 11 rebounds, made a three-pointer to end the Owls' 
drought. Temple missed six shots and committed five turnovers while the Scarlet 
Knights made their run. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Brunson's three-pointer for Temple was sandwiched by two Rutgers free 
throws, and then McKie scored on a drive and Eddie Jones added another 
three-pointer as the Owls took a 57-43 lead with 11:53 left. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 17 Georgia Tech 74, Virginia 70 -- Travis Best and James Forrest scored 20 
points apiece to lead Georgia Tech at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Best fouled out with slightly more than a minute to play and Forrest didn't 
start because of a stomach virus, entering the game four minutes after it began 
and going the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Forrest's short jumper in the lane with 4:42 left to play capped a 10-0 
Georgia Tech run and gave the Yellow Jackets (11-5, 2-3 Atlantic Coast 
Conference) their largest lead of the game, 63-52. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia (10-6, 4-2) battled back from a nine-point deficit in the last 1:51 
to pull to 71-69 when Cornel Parker scored with 12 seconds remaining. But 
Georgia Tech's Drew Barry made two free throws to make it 73-69 with 11 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 Memphis State 62, No. 19 Cincinnati 55 -- Cedric Henderson and Sylvester Ford 
each scored 16 points at Memphis to help Memphis State end an eight-game losing 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers (6-9, 1-4 Great Midwest) went on a 19-0 run during a nine-minute 
period in the first half to take a 23-14 lead over Cincinnati (12-5, 1-2). 
OTHER GAMES 
</P>
<P>
 B.J. Tyler had 36 points and Terrence Rencher and Albert Burditt each had 22, 
leading Texas (11-6) to a 107-96 victory over Georgia (8-8) at Austin, Tex. . . 
. Jim Rullo scored a career-high 24 points to lead Drexel (14-2) to a 88-73 
victory over Boston University (7-8) at Philadelphia. . . . Greg Smith scored 
18 points to help Delaware (9-7, 2-2 North Atlantic) to a 59-56 victory over 
Northeastern (4-11, 1-3) at Newark, Del.

WORLD SPORTS SCENE / RANDY HARVEY; KWAN, THE CALM AMID STORMS, JUST GOES ABOUT 
HER BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While the earth shakes in nearby communities, and man-made tremors threaten to 
split apart her sport, Michelle Kwan of Torrance diligently goes about her 
business at Lake Arrowhead's International Ice Castle, preparing her programs 
in case she is called upon to skate in next month's Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were told right after the national championships that we were to train 
very hard, as if we were going to Norway," Kwan's coach, Frank Carroll, said 
over the weekend. "That's what we've been doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. wanted the 13-year-old Kwan, the 
first alternate because of her second-place finish in the national 
championships, to be ready in case Nancy Kerrigan was unable to skate because 
of knee injuries sustained in the assault in Detroit. But now that it seems 
Kerrigan will be fine, it could be that Kwan will replace national champion 
Tonya Harding if Harding is implicated in the attack and removed from the 
Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're kind of in limbo," Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
 So is the USFSA, which has until Jan. 31 to name its Olympians, including 
alternates. If anyone selected to compete in Norway is subsequently unable to 
skate, the U.S. Olympic Committee has until Feb. 21, two days before the 
women's competition begins in Norway, to replace her with an alternate. 
</P>

 Should Harding's legal status not be resolved before the U.S. women are 
scheduled to leave on Feb. 9, it is possible Kwan would be asked to go to 
Norway with them in case a change has to be made later. But because alternates 
are not allowed to live in the athletes' village or skate at official 
practices, the USOC would have to arrange alternate accommodations. 
</P>

<P>
 A recent item in this column reporting that George Steinbrenner is a financial 
contributor to Kwan could have caused her problems with other backers, who 
wondered why they should give if the New York Yankee owner is picking up the 
tab. As since has been explained to them, Steinbrenner has sent her $7,000, 
which, while generous, does not put her in Don Mattingly's income bracket.

 Most Europeans do not seem concerned about the security of their figure 
skaters, probably because their champions rarely become cultural icons such as 
Peggy Fleming and Dorothy Hamill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would never happen in France," Eugene Peizerat, secretary general of the 
French Ice Skating Federation, told the Associated Press. "We don't think that 
way here. It seems to me to be a money-related problem. It's gone commercial 
over there."

 Speaking of commercials, Kerrigan made a brief trip to Los Angeles last week 
to film one for Reebok. According to Reebok spokesman Dave Fogelson, the 
general theme was "overcoming obstacles." 
</P>
<P>
 But Fogelson could not reveal the location of the shoot because he didn't 
know. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to know," he said. "If I'm captured, it can't be beaten out of 
me."

 The sports scandal captivating Great Britain involves Cliff Temple, the 
respected track and field correspondent for the London Times who committed 
suicide by throwing himself under a train. The British Athletic Federation is 
investigating to determine whether its promotions officer, Andy Norman, 
emotionally pushed Temple. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sports boss hounded suicide reporter," claimed a recent headline in the 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned about a Times investigation into his activities as the most powerful 
man in British track and field, Norman allegedly threatened to spread stories 
about a sexual relationship between Temple and a female athlete formerly 
coached by the correspondent. The athlete, Shireen Bailey, denied there was a 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey and other athletes who were coached by Temple and the British Athletic 
Writers' Assn. have called for Norman's banishment from the sport, but the BAF 
has allowed him to remain in his position during the investigation.

 Helen Stephens, 75, died last week after a stroke in Florissant, Mo. She was 
less famous for the two gold medals she won in track and field in the 1936 
Summer Olympics in Berlin than for her encounter afterward with Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hitler comes in and gives me the Nazi salute," she said later. "I gave him a 
good old Missouri handshake. Immediately, Hitler goes for the jugular vein. He 
gets ahold of my fanny, and he begins to squeeze and pinch and hug me up, and 
he said, 'You're a true Aryan type. You should be running for Germany.' 
</P>
<P>
 "So after he gave me the once-over and a full massage, he asked me if I'd like 
to spend the weekend in Berchtesgaden." She declined.

 Andrew Magee's errorless final round of 67 on the par-72 Tucson National 
course kept him ahead of all challengers and produced a two-shot victory Sunday 
at the Northern Telecom Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Magee, 31, started his 10th PGA Tour season with his first title since 1991 
and fourth overall.His four-day total was 18-under 270. He won $198,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Don Blake, Loren Roberts, Vijay Singh and Steve Stricker tied at 272. 
Roberts shot a 64, the day's lowest round, and Singh carded a 65. 
</P>
<P>
 Magee birdied Nos. 3, 8, 11 and 14, then finished with four consecutive pars 
while Blake and Stricker, his closest pursuers, faltered. 
</P>
<P>
 Olin Browne had the shot of the day on the 495-yard, par-five No. 2 when he 
made double eagle-two by sinking a four-iron shot from 217 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
 But Browne was only two-under for the rest of the round and finished sixth at 
273.

GOLF / DAN HAFNER; MCSPADEN, NOW 85, HAS TWICE SHOT 11 STROKES UNDER HIS AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He doesn't hit the ball quite as far and his putting is a bit shaky, but 
Harold (Jug) McSpaden, according to Chi Chi Rodriguez, is a golf phenomenon at 
85. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days before the big money in professional golf, Byron Nelson and 
McSpaden were called the "Gold Dust Twins." 
</P>
<P>
 Between them, they won most of the tournaments on the PGA Tour. The "gold" was 
sometimes as much as $1,500 for a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nissan Los Angeles Open, to be held at Riviera Country Club Feb. 8-11, is 
honoring McSpaden, who won it half a century ago, in 1944 when the tournament 
was played at Wilshire Country Club. McSpaden remembers playing Riviera in 
1929, when it was only 2 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 He is still a solid golfer, as he proved with an 80 in a practice round the 
other day at Riviera. Twice last year he shot rounds of 74, 11 shots under his 
age. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chi Chi said it was the most amazing feat in golf," McSpaden said. "He bows 
every time he sees me and says it's guys like us old-timers who made it 
possible for these people to earn all this money. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1934 I won all four tournaments in California. I won here in L.A., at 
Pasadena and Sacramento and won the San Francisco match-play tournament. I won 
less than $6,000 for the bunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last spring at the Legends of Golf, they held an unusual event. All the old 
golfers, like Tommy Bolt, Jerry Barber and myself, were in a 36-hole contest. 
The feat was to shoot your age or under for both rounds. If you failed on the 
first you were gone. I shot 78-80 and won $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, bread costs a lot more than a nickel these days." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1944 McSpaden was No. 2 on the money list, behind Nelson, and earned 
$23,855.30 in War Bonds. After winning 17 tournaments, McSpaden, then 38, 
retired in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just plain got tired of it," he said. "We drove to all the tournaments and 
played golf five or six days a week, depending on how far we had to drive 
between tournaments. I knew how long it took and the best roads to take to just 
about every city in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "That last year in the L.A. Open (1947) at Riviera, Sam Snead made a birdie 
three on the 18th to beat us. I quit after the Masters that year. I 
three-putted 11, 13 and 15, and when I three-putted 18, I lost to Jimmy Demaret 
by two shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe my best year was 1938. I played more than 100 rounds that year and 
sportswriter Grantland Rice figured that I averaged 69.37 strokes a round. I 
remember during the war Bob Hope and Bing Crosby staged a tournament to raise 
money for the war. I shot 64-65 -- 129 to win it. Bob Crosby and I won the 
pro-am and it made Bing so mad he wouldn't give the trophy to his brother." 
</P>
<P>
 When McSpaden left the tour, he joined Palm Beach Clothing Co., which sent him 
to Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when I finally started to make money," McSpaden said. "The stock just 
kept going up. . . . I was tired of the traveling to play golf, but in my 
clothing job I was on the road almost as much." 
</P>
<P>
 He was headquartered at a home on the Victory Hills Golf Course in Kansas 
City, Kan., which he built in 1929. At 2 a.m. one day in 1978, McSpaden awoke 
to find the house on fire from a smoldering cigarette. He woke up his wife, 
Betsy, and she thought he was joking. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was no joke," McSpaden said. "It was terrible. The flames were all around 
us and we tried crawling. A glass door blew out and we were right in the fire. 
We made it out, but I was temporarily blinded. I had cataracts on both eyes. I 
had to have surgery and in those days they didn't have laser. It took a doctor 
with steel nerves and it was scary, but I finally regained my eyesight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The house was mostly redwood and the fire just wouldn't stay put out. When it 
finally burned itself out, the only thing left was the fireplace. We rented a 
trailer and lived on the property until the house was rebuilt." 
</P>
<P>
 Golf became an avocation after he left the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was retired 40 years until I was persuaded to start playing in some senior 
events," McSpaden said. "I kept playing socially, but never worked at it. So I 
started playing in the Legends and the Senior Open." 
</P>
<P>
 The USGA decreed that players in the Senior Open must walk 18 holes all four 
days of the tournament in 1989. Some elected not to play. But McSpaden, then 
80, could still walk a brisk 18 holes, and he did. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he says he doesn't play often now, he apologized for shooting the 80 
at Riviera. He was breaking in a new set of clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was in his prime, McSpaden was a long hitter, but not as long as Jimmy 
Thompson. Thompson, the John Daly of that day, often hit the ball 325-350 
yards, McSpaden said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nowadays, they are making clubs that won't slice or hook," he said. "So the 
present-day golfers can't do the things with a golf ball we could." 
</P>
<P>
 McSpaden shot a 59 long before Al Geiberger did at Memphis. "The only problem 
was that it came in the round before the San Antonio Open," McSpaden said. 
"When it counted, I shot a 74, but I followed that with a 63. I had a 
distinguished group sign the card for the 59. Playing with me were Nelson, Paul 
Runyan and Walter Hagen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hit my drives about 50 yards shorter than I did then, and sometimes I don't 
putt so well, but with these new clubs, I guess I'll keep playing a bit 
longer." Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Al Geiberger recently bought a second home in Palm Springs, then learned there 
won't be a senior tournament there this season. The Vintage at the Vintage 
Country Club was one of the first successful senior events, but it became 
unwieldy for the club to handle last year and it was moved to Indian Wells 
Resort. It couldn't find a sponsor this year, but is expected to return to the 
area in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Floyd told Golf Digest he hopes his sons Raymond Jr., 19, and Robert, 
17, don't pursue professional golf careers because they wouldn't have their own 
golf identities. But Dave Stockton is reveling in Dave Jr.'s qualification for 
the PGA Tour. In his first event, the Hawaiian Open, Dave Stockton Jr. finished 
five under par and picked up $2,819. . . . Stockton Sr. has already informed 
officials he will play in the GTE West at Ojai March 3-6.

RUNNING; PFEFFER IS SAN DIEGO WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WOLF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Kirk Pfeffer retired from road racing nine years ago, he was one of the 
best distance runners in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he is on the road again, Pfeffer looks as though he never left. 
Sunday, he made a runaway of the San Diego Marathon, winning by more than a 
mile in 2 hours 20 minutes 55 seconds. His time for 26.2 miles averaged 5:22 
per mile. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfeffer, 37, who grew up in San Diego, attended the University of Colorado and 
lives in Boulder, spent five years in retirement before he reached the 
conclusion that he didn't like it. This was his first marathon victory since he 
began his comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got my confidence back now," he said. "Even though this isn't a race 
like New York, I finished first, and I feel like I've got some good races 
left." 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Luis Chuela of Guadalajara, Mexico, finished second in 2:27:21. James 
Sheremeta of Del Mar, a San Diego State alumnus, celebrated his 30th birthday 
by completing his first marathon in three tries and running third in 2:29:50. 
Marcial Beltran of Cuernevaca, Mexico, a former Fullerton Community College and 
Occidental College runner, was fourth in 2:33:49. 
</P>
<P>
 In the women's race, Cheryl Brady, 34, of Honolulu overtook Terri Chapman of 
Escondido in the 24th mile and won in 3:00:16. Chapman was second in 3:02:05, 
Cinde Wiebusch of Phoenix third in 3:06:13 and Susan Given of Roanoke, Va., the 
early leader, fourth in 3:12:32. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1981, Pfeffer won a marathon in Japan in 2:10:29, his personal best. 
Five years before that, he set a world junior record of 2:17:44 in the old 
Mission Bay Marathon in San Diego. When he entered Sunday's race, he was aiming 
at 2:20, which he missed by a mere 55 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just ran what I thought was a comfortable pace," he said. "My calves 
tightened up after 10 miles, but I eventually felt better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took over pretty much from the start. Chuela was with me 'til the 12th or 
13th mile, but then he started falling back, so I felt he was done." 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman came from far back to take the women's lead from Given in the 13th 
mile, only to be outlasted by Brady. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hurting," Chapman said.

SANTA ANITA; MCCARRON WILL LOSE RIDES IN TWO STAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There seldom is a good time for a jockey to draw a suspension, and Chris 
McCarron's five-day penalty is no exception. The suspension, which starts 
Thursday at Santa Anita, also applies to other tracks because of racing's 
reciprocity rule and will prevent McCarron from riding the Eclipse 
Award-winning Dehere in his debut as a 3-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 Dehere, who beat the Santa Anita-based Brocco in a close vote for best 
2-year-old male, is scheduled to begin his Kentucky Derby campaign next Sunday 
at Gulfstream Park in the $75,000 Hutcheson Stakes, a prep for other Gulfstream 
races leading up to the Florida Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll miss him this time, then get back on him his next race," said Scott 
McClellan, who is McCarron's agent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Anita stewards announced McCarron's suspension Sunday after 
reviewing the interference that his mount, Queens Court Queen, caused in the 
stretch run of Saturday's seventh race. Queens Court Queen was disqualified 
from first to third place. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspension will also cost McCarron the mount on Bien Bien, who will be the 
favored Saturday in the $125,000 San Marcos Handicap at Santa Anita. McCarron 
rode Bien Bien to victory last year in the Hollywood Turf Handicap and the 
Sunset Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 After other jockeys rode Dehere in his first two starts last year, McCarron 
was hired to ride the colt. Bob Brennan, who owns Dehere, wanted a California 
jockey because the Breeders' Cup Juvenile was going to be run at Santa Anita in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarron rode Dehere to three of his four stakes victories, including the 
Hopeful at Saratoga and the Champagne at Belmont Park. In the Breeders' Cup, 
however, Dehere bled from the lungs and ran eighth as Brocco won by five 
lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarron's suspension ended a week that started with his home being damaged in 
the Northridge earthquake. A few of his Breeders' Cup trophies were broken. 
</P>
<P>
 Working between races Sunday at Gulfstream, Dehere was timed in a fast 57 4/5 
for five furlongs. Jerry Bailey was aboard for the work, but he is committed to 
another horse in the Hutcheson. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarron is the leading stakes jockey at the Santa Anita meeting with four 
winners, including Saturday's astride Hill Pass in the San Pasqual Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other leading jockeys at Santa Anita -- Kent Desormeaux and Chris Antley 
-- were handed five-day suspensions on Saturday for not maintaining straight 
courses with horses on Friday's card. Those suspensions start Wednesday. 
McCarron's suspension runs through Wednesday, Feb. 2. Desormeaux, who has 21 
winners, is tied with Alex Solis for the top spot in the standings and Antley 
has 20. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On his last mount before the suspension starts, Chris Antley rode Individual 
Style to a narrow win over Argolid in Sunday's $110,050 California Breeders' 
Champion Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual Style, paying $5.20, won by a neck, becoming only the third 
favorite to win a stake out of 17 at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual Style, who has won six of eight starts, earned $65,050, increasing 
his total to $223,650 for his owners, Jim Reynolds, Ronnie Penton and Chris 
Hemming. His time for seven furlongs was 1:21 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time he ever ran, Individual Style won by 10 lengths in a $32,000 
claiming race. Since then, he has won four stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We seemed to have most of the speed in the race, especially when The 
Immobilizer scratched," trainer Lin Wheeler said. "But I knew they weren't 
going to give us an easy lead, and sure enough Bob Baffert's horse (Argolid) 
went right with us most of the way. Then when my horse kicked loose at the 
quarter pole, I thought he was going to win easy. Then Baffert's horse came 
back at us a little bit." Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In another stake on Sunday's card, Monde Bleu, who finished seventh in the 
Breeders' Cup Sprint, won his first race in the United States, the Reb's Policy 
Handicap. Wayne Lukas, who trains Monde Bleu, said his El Camino Real Derby 
winner, Tabasco Cat, probably will run in the Fountain of Youth Stakes at 
Gulfstream Park on Feb. 19. Tabasco Cat's victory at Bay Meadows Saturday came 
in his first start since a third-place finish in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. He 
is the horse who knocked down Wayne's son, Jeff, on Dec. 15 in the barn area at 
Santa Anita. The younger Lukas, his father's chief assistant, has been 
hospitalized with head injuries since the accident. Wayne Lukas said that his 
son was told that Tabasco Cat won the El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
 Wekiva Springs will probably meet Valiant Nature and Brocco, the 1-2 finishers 
in the Hollywood Futurity, in the San Rafael Stakes on March 6 after winning 
the Santa Catalina Saturday. "The spacing is perfect," trainer Bob Hess Jr. 
said, "not only between Saturday's race and the San Rafael, but between the San 
Rafael and the Santa Anita Derby (on April 9)." . . . Gary Stevens called in 
sick Sunday and two of his mounts won with substitute jockeys. . . . Spirited 
Susan, winner of the third race Sunday, gave owner Susan Hallman her 100th 
winner. . . . Only four 3-year-old fillies -- Emerald Colony, Princess 
Mitterand, Dianes Halo and Jacodra's Devil -- were entered for Wednesday's 
Santa Ysabel Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita has pledged $15,000 and the Oak Tree Racing Assn. $5,000 to the 
American Red Cross for earthquake relief. Santa Anita will also donate $1 per 
person for fans in excess of 15,000 at the track on Saturday. . . . Jockey Alex 
Solis and his agent, Harry Hacek, will donate all of their earnings from 
Friday's races to earthquake-relief funds. . . . Meafara will be bred to 
Dayjur, the horse who jumped a shadow near the finish line and finished second 
to Safely Kept in the 1990 Breeders' Cup Sprint. Before she was recently 
retired, Meafara finished second in the last two runnings of the Sprint.

COLLEGE TENNIS; LEACH DUPLICATES OLDER BROTHER'S FEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jon Leach on Sunday became only the second player in the 12-year history of 
the Adidas Invitational tennis tournament to win both singles and double 
championships in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
 And it came as no surprise to the USC senior to learn that the first was his 
older brother, Rick, a former Trojan All-American who accomplished the feat in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's won so many tournaments," Leach said of his brother, a doubles 
specialist who helped the United States win Davis Cups in 1990 and 1992, "that 
basically, every tournament I win, he's already won." 
</P>
<P>
 Leach duplicated one of the most noteworthy of his brother's undergraduate 
accomplishments by defeating Arizona sophomore Jan Anderson in the singles 
final, 6-3, 6-3, and combining with Wayne Black to defeat USC assistant Matt 
Anger and teaching pro Sean Brawley in the doubles final, 6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Black, a USC junior, was the defending singles champion and was seeded No. 2 
this year, but he lost to the unseeded Anderson, a left-hander from Hamar, 
Norway, in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who played at Nebraska as a freshman, started fast against Leach, 
breaking his eighth-seeded opponent's serve in the second game to open a 2-0 
lead on the clubhouse court at Hyatt Grand Champions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Leach held serve the rest of the way in gaining a wild-card entry into the 
Newsweek Champions Cup Feb. 28-March 6 at Grand Champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas Black was content to slug it out with Anderson, who rarely strays from 
the baseline, Leach frustrated Anderson by bringing him to the net to retrieve 
a succession of drop shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "He played his best match, and he had to," said his father, USC Coach Dick 
Leach. "I just can't wait until his brother finds out he won this. Rick's going 
to be really proud of him." 
</P>
<P>
 On the whole, Jon Leach has not been able to duplicate the individual 
accomplishments of his brother, the only four-time All-American in both singles 
and doubles in NCAA Division I history. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon, though, helped USC win national championships in 1991 and 1993, something 
his brother never did. His play in the Adidas Invitational, which included 
professionals and top-ranked juniors as well as college players, will do 
wonders for his self-esteem, his father suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 "This might give him confidence for the rest of the year," Dick Leach said. 
"He's just getting better and better and better." 
</P>
<P>
 Better than his brother? 
</P>
<P>
 "He beats Ricky more times than he loses to him," Dick Leach said. "Ricky gets 
so frustrated, saying 'Why don't you play like this in the tournaments and 
maybe you'd beat some of the college players.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Anderson knew Rick Leach's frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "He played a great match," Anderson said. "I haven't seen him play much better 
than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Until the final, Anderson was the surprise of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's still an unknown quantity to me," said Arizona Coach Bill Wright, who 
recruited Anderson last summer without having seen him play after learning that 
Anderson had been released from his scholarship by Nebraska and wanted to 
transfer. "I knew he had to be pretty good. I didn't know he was this good. 
He's got a lot of potential." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright wasn't discouraged by what he saw Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Leach) played just too great," Wright said.

CHINESE DRAFT SWEATSHOP LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A southern Chinese province that is home to thousands of sweatshop factories 
is drafting a law that would limit work hours and set job safety standards, an 
official newspaper said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The worker protection law being drafted in Guangdong province, which adjoins 
Hong Kong, will limit the workday to eight hours and require workplaces to be 
safe and sanitary, the China Daily Business Weekly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Factories that have dormitory housing for workers from the countryside must 
provide at least around seven square feet of living space per worker, the paper 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Many of the factories employ young people from poor villages who are willing 
to work for extremely low wages. In many cases the workers are being forced to 
put in 12- to 14-hour days and face harsh discipline.

ANN CONWAY: THEY CHOOSE TO MAKE DIFFERENCE; FOUR TELL WHY THEY VOLUNTEER TO 
CHAIR CHARITY AFFAIRS, EVEN THOUGH SUCCESS OR FAILURE CAN DEPEND ON THEIR 
VISION AND DRIVE.

<P>
 Dozens of meetings, hundreds of telephone calls, enough faxes to fill a 
compact car -- that's what it takes to plan the mega-benefits that this year 
will sink hundreds of thousands of dollars into Orange County charity coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do social leaders do it? Their reasons are as varied as the menus at their 
black-tie galas. 
</P>
<P>
 But one thing they share: unflinching vision. As Tiffany Vice President Jo 
Qualls puts it, "If you don't shoot for a star, how do you get one?" 
</P>
<P>
 A look, then, at People to Watch in 1994, the volunteer organizers behind "The 
Phantom of the Opera" gala at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, the 
Symphony of Jewels for the Pacific Symphony, a weekend extravaganza on behalf 
of the Smithsonian Institution's Archives of American Arts and more: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shari Esayian: When "The Phantom of the Opera" makes its debut at Segerstrom 
Hall on July 23, two celebrations are planned. The first, a daylight preview 
party, will take place immediately before the production, says Esayian, the 
Newport Beach arts activist who was invited to be gala chairwoman by the center 
board. The second, a higher ticket party, will be staged following the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Esayian plans to hold the events al fresco (think summer) in the large space 
between the center and its parking ramp. "We've trundled off to ballrooms often 
enough," she explains. "We want it to be fresh." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most exciting aspects of gala organizing is concept development. 
"We're trying to decide whether to create the dark and mysterious Phantom's 
lair or a bright and colorful masquerade atmosphere with candelabra and 
chandeliers," Esayian says. "It will be dark at the post-performance event. 
That will really lend itself to a dramatic backdrop." 
</P>
<P>
 Esayian volunteers her time to blockbuster charity projects because she has 
"so much fun with everybody," she says. "And, like any chairwoman, I want a 
beautiful product, but nobody lived or died because the stamp on the invitation 
didn't match the gala napkins. I go at it with a sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Jaquith: As a Los Angeles attorney and a trustee of the Leo Freedman 
Foundation, which doles out $650,000 annually to local charities, Jaquith has 
plenty to keep her busy. 
</P>
<P>
 But she is organizing and personally picking up the tab on the Feb. 11 dinner 
that will launch "Seven Decades: Modern Mexican Art from the Bernard Lewin 
Collection" at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in Santa Ana. (The Leo 
Freedman Foundation has made a $1-million commitment to the Bowers). 
</P>
<P>
 She will also co-chair the Pacific Symphony Orchestra's May 7 "Symphony of 
Jewels' with Qualls at the Hyatt Regency Irvine. (The foundation has made a 
$850,000 pledge to the orchestra.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel an emotional commitment to these groups," says Jaquith of her 
willingness to roll up her sleeves. "Anybody can write a check. It's more than 
just a money thing with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Guests at the Bowers' dinner honoring Bernard Lewin will include New Mexico 
sculptor Allan Houser, "Rain of Gold" author Victor Villasenor and his mother, 
Lupe (the main character in his book), artist Vladimir Cora, museum supporters 
and members of the business and arts communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting involved in a variety of charity projects is what life is all about, 
Jaquith says. "For me, it's important to understand people of different 
cultures, respect their differences, and work with them so we can help each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I believe in something or someone, I believe with all my heart. I'm 
willing to put in the time and effort and whatever financial resources I have 
available." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jo Qualls: With her corporate connection to Tiffany & Co., Qualls has a unique 
opportunity to bring a New York brand of sophistication to local galas. After 
all, the coffee table book, "Tiffany Parties" -- penned by the jeweler's design 
director, John Loring -- is society's unofficial guidebook to stylish 
soiree-giving. 
</P>
<P>
 Her involvement with the "Symphony of Jewels" marks the second time Qualls has 
chaired a gala in two years. Last December, she co-chaired the Candlelight 
Concert on behalf of the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinarily, a corporation will donate funds to a gala, buy tables, or provide 
auction items. It is unusual for a company vice president to take on the 
responsibility of a chairmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt it was a way I could show personal support behind the support the 
company would give," Qualls says. "It makes me feel good to think I have been 
part of the process, beginning to end. I enjoy helping out with the creative 
decisions. I like the opportunity to help others see new ways of doing things." 
</P>
<P>
 Qualls promises that this year's Symphony of Jewels will be the annual event's 
most exciting. She is about to sign on the dotted line with the two musical 
stars of the Broadway stage ("I can't announce their names until they've signed 
the contract," she says) who will perform at the gala. Orchestra members will 
also be featured in the entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the elements used in the grand opening of Tiffany & Co. at South Coast 
Plaza five years ago will be incorporated into the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're bringing back our vignette concept," she says. During the gala's 
cocktail reception, guests will be able to gaze upon 12 dressed-to-the-hilt 
models dripping in millions of dollars' worth of Tiffany jewels. 
</P>
<P>
 And, for the first time, a keepsake calendar informing them of the orchestra's 
performance schedule and related information about composers will be 
distributed to guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualls says the gala is going to be "stretchy" and "reachy." "We're going to 
move everything up a notch or two across the board," she says. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Electa Anderson: When she attended last year's Los Angeles benefit on behalf 
of the Smithsonian Institution's Archives of American Art, Anderson took 40 
people from Orange County with her. The cost for the gala honoring artist David 
Hockney ranged from $500 to $750 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, it struck Anderson that Orange County was ready for the same kind 
of fund-raiser. "We've become sophisticated enough to support a benefit like 
that," says Anderson, an arts activist who does special event planning for 
Roger's Gardens in Corona del Mar. Orange County is full of art enthusiasts and 
serious collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan: a weekend getaway this fall at the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point (the 
locale is not confirmed, she says) that will culminate in a lavish Sunday gala. 
</P>
<P>
 On the guest list, besides locals: national members of the support agroups for 
the Archives of American Art, a resource bureau within the Smithsonian 
Institution that can provide background information on virtually any American 
artist. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson would also like to found a support group for the archives here. "The 
archives is the one place a person can get information on an American artist 
without worrying about the information provider's agenda," she says. "It is not 
self-serving."

POLITICALLY PERILOUS TIMES FOR SAFETY PANEL; LEGISLATURE: GROUP SEEMS TO BE 
HEEDING PUBLIC DEMAND FOR ANTI-CRIME LAWS. O.C. MEMBER SEES THAT AS A 
'POSITIVE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a political lynching on drive-time radio. One recent afternoon, talk 
show hosts John Kobylt and Ken Chiampou of KFI-AM in Los Angeles were whipping 
up their Southland audience with discussion of the tragic murder of 12-year-old 
Polly Klaas. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief problem, they growled, was the feloniously lenient Assembly Public 
Safety Committee, a traditional killing field for tough anti-crime proposals. 
Among their targets -- Orange County Assemblyman Tom Umberg, a moderate 
Democrat on the crime committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that Umberg, a former federal prosecutor eyeing a run for state 
attorney general, considers himself one of the good guys on the panel. Never 
mind that he typically votes tough on crime. "The blood of Polly Klaas" is on 
the hands of the assemblyman and his peers, the talk show hosts concluded, 
wondering aloud how Umberg might feel if a similar tragedy befell his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, not every listener distinguished rhetorical overkill from 
reality. In the hours that followed, Umberg received several death threats. 
</P>
<P>
 Such overt forms of intimidation aside, these remain politically perilous 
times for the Assembly Public Safety Committee. With voter anger over the 
state's unflagging crime problems continuing to soar, the committee has become 
a bull's-eye for scorn. 
</P>
<P>
 Victims' rights groups are shouting long-simmering gripes. Newspaper 
columnists and editorial writers are bludgeoning the committee in print. 
Republicans in the Capitol are having a field day. Still more criticism is 
likely to come during Gov. Pete Wilson's two-day "crime summit," which is 
scheduled for early next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruised by the attacks and wary of alienating voters in an election year, the 
Assembly Public Safety Committee now appears to be steering a new course. Newly 
reconstituted with two Republicans and three moderate Democrats to offset a 
trio of liberals, the eight-member committee has acted in recent days to 
approve the first of what could be a bumper crop of law-and-order legislation 
made to order for the campaign trail. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting bills out I never thought we'd get out," said Assemblyman 
Richard K. Rainey (R-Walnut Creek), a former Contra Costa County sheriff and 
current committee member. "It's definitely a different year." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the legislation that has moved out of committee in the first weeks of 
session is a Rainey bill making it a felony for convicted sex offenders to 
avoid registering with police and another once-stalled Republican measure 
toughening the state's pornography laws. Most notably, the panel approved 
several different versions of the headline-grabbing "three strikes, you're out" 
proposal, which would put repeat felons behind bars for life. Last year, the 
idea was waylaid in the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the GOP celebrates newfound successes, most predict it won't last 
long. Once public attention turns away from crime, the committee will revert to 
its old ways, Republicans predict. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to strike while the iron is hot," Rainey concluded. "As soon as the 
heat is off, they'll go back to the way they were." 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats like Umberg (D-Garden Grove) aren't so sure. "This firestorm has 
caused the Legislature to refocus and has hopefully changed some attitudes," he 
said. "In my view, that's a positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Others see the furor ignited in the aftermath of the Klaas case more as the 
sort of mob mentality that won't produce intelligent, reasoned laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now it's like everyone is just piling on, trying to dream up the most 
Draconian proposal they can," said Assemblyman Tom Bates (D-Berkeley), a 
liberal on the safety committee who has continued to oppose many of the 
anti-crime measures. "People need to understand that we've made our sentencing 
laws in California the toughest in the world and it simply has not worked. It 
hasn't made us safer." 
</P>
<P>
 Such sentiments have helped drive the actions of the Assembly Public Safety 
Committee for roughly a quarter century. The panel has long been considered a 
cemetery for legislation the Democratic majority deemed reactionary or 
unconstitutional -- everything from measures to strengthen the death penalty to 
bills that would relax controls on firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's actions have been oriented as much toward politics as policy, 
insiders say. By killing bills before they reached the Assembly floor, the 
panel has protected Democratic members -- particularly those in vulnerable 
districts -- from having to cast politically damaging votes Republicans might 
use against them on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Former staffers, both Democrats and Republicans alike, today say the panel 
often did a service by killing half-baked legislation whipped up by lawmakers 
out to appear tough on crime. But the committee also snared a few good ideas, 
some contend, particularly from the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reason did not always prevail," said Judge Gary Mullen, who was appointed to 
the Sacramento County Superior Court in 1990 after staff stints with the state 
Senate and California District Attorneys Assn. "Historically, the committee has 
been absolutely stacked, in some years to such a degree that it's essentially 
been controlled by the (American Civil Liberties Union) and the criminal 
defense bar. Even moderate legislation was killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite gains in the first weeks of 1994, Republicans continue to grouse about 
the makeup of the committee, which has a smaller percentage of GOP 
representatives than any other. Under Assembly rules calling for proportional 
representation on all committees, the public safety panel should have three 
Republicans, but in recent years has featured only two. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans say the reason is simple: Assembly Speaker Willie Brown wants to 
ensure that tough crime legislation stays bottled up while "providing cover" 
for Umberg and Assemblyman Bob Epple (D-Cerritos) to cast law-and-order votes 
that play well in their blue-collar districts. As it is, Umberg and Epple can 
side with the two Republicans and bills still fail to get the five votes needed 
to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg, however, rejects such Machiavellian characterizations. "I've had my 
own frustrations in that committee. I've had bills watered down or killed," he 
said. "But I think those actions are born of true philosophical differences 
between members of the committee and not political machinations." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some critics concede the committee gauntlet has occasionally yielded 
legislation pleasing to the toughest crime fighter. Prison construction bills 
usually trundle through, they say, and help for law enforcement agencies is 
routinely embraced. When a rash of freeway shootings hit the Southland a few 
years ago, the committee reacted within weeks by producing new laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Mullen has surprisingly fond memories of working with Assemblyman John Burton 
(D-San Francisco), a former safety committee chairman and one of three liberals 
on the current panel, on a pair of bills in 1990 to reform the state penal code 
from top to bottom. Although approved by both houses, the law was later vetoed, 
presumably because it would have caused prison construction costs to soar, 
Mullen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience gave Mullen a new respect for Burton. "He, of all the past 
chairmen, was a realist," Mullen said. "You could sit down and talk to the man. 
We didn't get a lot, but what we did get was extremely significant." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Burton's role remains weighty, some Capitol insiders say. A close 
friend and ideological kin of Brown, Burton serves as a "ghost chairman" of the 
panel even though Epple now wields the gavel, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton scoffs at such assessments with his characteristic bluster. "I tend to 
get into details," he said, "but everyone knows Bobby is the chairman." 
</P>
<P>
 A more weighty question is whether the committee will continue on its current 
tack. While no one denies that liberals and conservatives in the Assembly 
continue to disagree on solutions, some say the gulf may be narrowing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Times have changed," Burton said. "People realize you can't give criminals 
cookies and milk and a pat on the head and say, 'Now be good boys.' In the same 
vein, I don't think most Republicans really believe you've got to lock them up 
on the first offense and throw away the key. You've got to take a shot at 
rehabilitating these first-time offenders." 
</P>
<P>
 Bates said he hopes the Legislature will get beyond the current fervor over 
the "three strikes" effort and seize on more innovative approaches. He suggests 
programs providing focused help to "at-risk" families and struggling 
grade-school students. Bates also wants to see alternatives, such as 
well-supervised work programs for drug dealers and other nonviolent offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people are vengeful and have blood in their eyes, politicians will reflect 
that," Bates said. "I have to hope the electorate will come off its emotional 
frenzy and realize that the direction we're now in hasn't worked." 
</P>
<P>
 Many members of the GOP, meanwhile, aren't optimistic that bipartisan 
solutions are near. 
</P>
<P>
 "The center of gravity in the Democratic caucus remains way to the left, and 
the Public Safety Committee reflects it," said Assemblyman Pat Nolan 
(R-Glendale), who faces criminal charges himself in the ongoing Capitol 
corruption scandal. "The only time important bills break free is when the 
public is screaming. It'll soon be back to normal." 
</P>
<P>
 Rainey, however, sees change as the state's term-limits law pumps new blood 
into the Legislature -- and ensconced Democrats like Brown are forced out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new lawmakers coming in will realize they only have a few years up here," 
Rainey said. "And after Willie is out in 1996, there will never again be a 
speaker who can consolidate power as he has. Hopefully, there will fewer games 
being played."

LIGHT RAIN IS GOOD NEWS FOR EVACUEES; AFTERMATH: THE 4,000 RESIDENTS IN 5 TENT 
CITIES GIVE SIGHS OF RELIEF. GRANADA HILLS REMAINS THE ONLY AREA LACKING WATER 
SERVICE.

 As the threat of rain evaporated and more tap water was pronounced drinkable, 
San Fernando Valley residents flocked to churches, learned to keep house in 
National Guard tents and continued tidying up quake-jumbled homes while 
cringing from additional aftershocks Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 After testing local water supplies, state health officials said residents of 
North Hollywood, Panorama City, Sunland, Tujunga, Sylmar, Pacoima, Lake View 
Terrace and Van Nuys no longer need to boil drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the last 5,000 Northridge households without water had their 
service restored, and residents north of Ventura Boulevard in Studio City and 
Sherman Oaks were advised they can use water straight from the tap. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the day, Granada Hills was the only Valley community still 
without water service. 
</P>
<P>
 Although meteorologists had predicted a major downpour over the weekend, only 
small amounts of rain fell briefly on parts of the Valley, bringing sighs of 
relief to more than 4,000 people crowding into five tent cities erected by 
National Guard soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 By Sunday night, five aftershocks measuring magnitude 3.0 or greater had 
rolled across Los Angeles, keeping jolt-weary residents on edge yet another 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8:15 p.m., a 4.5 temblor struck about three miles south of Newhall, 
according to a Caltech seismologist. That brought the number of aftershocks 
since Monday's 6.6 quake to more than 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Sunday, construction crews toiled into the night to put finishing touches 
on two Metrolink stations in Palmdale and Lancaster. The stations, built in 
just four days, are intended to ease an anticipated crush of commuters heading 
out of the Antelope Valley toward Los Angeles this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 While there was no rainstorm, doctors staffing clinics at the tent cities said 
the cool, drizzly weather contributed to some medical problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Dan Grossman, a member of a medical team from UCLA-Olive View Medical 
Center in Sylmar attending to residents of the tent city at Winnetka Recreation 
Center, said that in one hour Sunday the team saw 85 patients, many of them 
children with colds or flu. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't say it's an epidemic," Grossman said, "but it's very dusty and 
damp here." 
</P>
<P>
 An infant at the Lanark Recreation Center tent city in Canoga Park was taken 
to a hospital after apparently choking. The infant was treated and released, as 
was another child airlifted to Children's Hospital after suffering minor 
injuries from a fall at a Salvation Army service center in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 People at the Winnetka tent city were treated to some musical entertainment in 
the afternoon when a band, complete with electric guitar and congas, struck up 
a rollicking rendition of "Soy Feliz" ("I'm Happy"). A group of about 40 people 
clapped and swayed to the music. 
</P>
<P>
 But some teen-agers seemed to be suffering from boredom after days of outdoor 
living. "It's not much fun," said a dejected Sandra Ramirez, 14, as she sat in 
front of a tent at the Winnetka center, munching an apple. 
</P>
<P>
 The day also was filled with church services, both indoors and out. 
</P>
<P>
 About 35 members of the Voices of Iglesia de Cristo Church went to Reseda 
Park, singing hymns and dancing to a guitar and tambourine as they motioned for 
campers in the park to join them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even when things seem bad, the Lord is always there. . ." the church group 
sang, in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Another church group walked into different campsites asking victims if they 
needed to talk. "We are telling them not to be afraid," said Juan Salmeron, 
holding the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in the same situation as them." 
</P>
<P>
 Salmeron's group was from Iglesia Christiana Adonai Church in Canoga Park, 
which was damaged by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most oft-repeated Bible quotations on Sunday was taped to the back 
of a Salvation Army truck at the tent city at Lanark Recreation Center. It is 
taken from Psalm 46. 
</P>
<P>
 "God is our refuge and our strength, an ever-present help in trouble. 
Therefore we will not fear though the Earth give way. . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Roman Catholic Cardinal Roger Mahony said Mass before thousands of 
parishioners at damaged churches. At Santa Rosa Church in San Fernando, the 
church was packed to overflowing but the aisles were kept clear and the doors 
open in case of an aftershock. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last few days we have had to change our priorities to our family, our 
health," Mahony said, as parishioners who were afraid to enter the building 
knelt outside, praying feverishly, unable to hear him. 
</P>
<P>
 "These things have become more important than the loss of a television or 
other material possessions. . . . From this misery, much good can come." 
</P>
<P>
 At Valley Korean Community Church in Sylmar, a throng of 200 college-aged 
Korean Americans crowded into a small, 22-pew sanctuary, its concrete ceiling 
cracked and plaster peeling from the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "God's intent is not to laugh at us and to have fun with his children," 
preached the pastor, John Koh, to an upbeat audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see, it doesn't matter if you have a 7.5-earthquake, or if the earth 
rumbles for the whole year," Koh said. "Don't let circumstances rob you of 
God's peace." 
</P>
<P>
 In sharp contrast was a sermon given in the same church later in the morning 
to an older crowd. The disaster, said the Rev. Kevin Shim, was God's way of 
awakening and disciplining his children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have sin in our heart," Shim declared. "If God did this to us, we must 
turn to God and confess our sins to him." 
</P>
<P>
 In Northridge, the partially collapsed Northridge Meadows apartment building 
where 16 residents died Monday remained off limits to survivors wanting to 
salvage their remaining possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 City building inspectors were devising a plan to shore up the building with 
heavy timber supports before letting people in, a process that may take several 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents refused to wait for permission to retrieve such necessities as 
money, identification and a change of clothes. One unidentified man snuck in 
under the yellow police tape and entered the condemned building, only to be 
detained and later released by police officers early Sunday, said Morris 
Reaves, an engineer with the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Glantz, 27, was one of the impatient ones. Since the disaster 
occurred, Glantz said he has crawled past National Guardsmen eight times to get 
into his girlfriend Julie Rush's second-story apartment to retrieve possessions 
and to videotape the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not risking my life," said Glantz, who said he earned about $300 by 
selling the videotape to news stations. 
</P>
<P>
 City building inspectors did allow residents access to some units in the 
apartment complex next door, the Northridge Apartments. 
</P>

Timothy Williams, and correspondents Kay Hwangbo and Jeannette Regalado

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE IN RECORDER'S OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A number of official reviews of Orange County Recorder Lee Branch's office 
over the years have raised serious questions about the way he managed. The 
concern has grown in recent months, and now the Board of Supervisors is poised 
to censure him. 
</P>
<P>
 Branch has not been charged with or convicted of any official wrong-doing, and 
he denies that he has done anything wrong. But clearly he has lost both the 
confidence of his own employees and that of a broad cross section of county 
leaders who have investigated his stewardship. It is therefore apparent that he 
cannot continue in office with any reasonable expectation of effectiveness. He 
should resign for the good of the county and for the good of his staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints from judges and various reports since the 1980s, two that came in 
last week, all point to serious concerns about his management. The county's 
affirmative action officer, who investigated employee complaints, concluded 
this month that Branch should leave. In the other recent report, focusing on 
management deficiencies, a review found that the recorder had become isolated 
and unresponsive. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees told investigators in both reports that they are demoralized. The 
report compiled by the affirmative action officer found that at least nine 
employees sought medical or psychological treatment for stress and depression. 
In an office that deals with the vital records of an individual's life -- birth 
and death certificates, the deed to a house -- workers have enough stress 
meeting the public's expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 A major source of the latest complaint in the affirmative action inquiry about 
Branch has been his involvement with a woman who worked for him, a relationship 
both acknowledged. Subordinates said she "wielded tremendous power" and used it 
to "intimidate" others. Both Branch and his assistant deny that. But many 
companies bar one person in a relationship from supervising the other. And 
these recent concerns are but one example of a lengthy record of concerns about 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, when Branch held the combined post of recorder and county clerk, 
state appellate court judges in Santa Ana issued more than a dozen orders 
threatening to hold Branch in contempt for not forwarding long-overdue files 
from Superior Court trials. More deficiencies were found in a management audit 
the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 In subsequent years, county supervisors denied Branch pay raises to get him to 
reform. There have been recent complaints of sexual harassment and physical 
abuse, which he denies; last year they led the supervisors to put him on paid 
leave for several weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the inquiries by the affirmative action officer and a 
specialist in employee relations, the supervisors have been urged by the county 
administrative officer to take control over the office. If Branch resists 
stepping aside, there is little the county can do. A seldom-used law lets the 
grand jury recommend the district attorney file civil misconduct charges, but 
that requires a full-fledged trial. That would not start until long after June, 
when Branch is up for reelection.  
</P>
<P>
 He makes $75,000 a year, and county officials estimate he could get nearly 
$60,000 a year in retirement. The best advice for Branch is in those numbers; 
he should take the money and go.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; WEEK 2: RATTLED, BUT REOPENING; STOP DENYING, 
START PREPARING FOR NEXT CRISIS, EXPERTS WARN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA K. H. WALTERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For many small- and medium-size businesses throughout Southern California, the 
denial stage -- "It can't happen to us" -- was shattered a week ago today along 
with glass and nerves. Now is the time to get ready for the next disaster, no 
matter what form it takes. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you are trying to put your business back together, were spared 
significant damage or are thanking your lucky stars that you hadn't yet opened 
your planned small business, there are lessons in emergency preparedness to be 
learned from the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say that while smaller businesses may not have the resources to 
develop and implement full-scale disaster plans as larger corporations do, 
there are many things they can and certainly should do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Earthquake preparedness is very good business. It's bottom-line stuff," said 
Eliza Chan, an official with a San Francisco Bay Area office of the Earthquake 
Program of the Governor's Office of Emergency Preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan cited statistics from the U.S. Small Business Administration showing that 
28% of businesses that close after an emergency never reopen. Of those that do, 
about a third continue to have financial problems for the following two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing is for business not to be closed down by emergencies," Chan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Libby Lafferty, president of Lafferty & Associates, a La Canada Flintridge 
disaster and emergency consulting and training firm, said emergency planning 
should be integrated into a business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something for emergency preparedness should be in the budget every year," she 
said. "Then you have to exercise your plan and update it regularly." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are steps suggested by various safety, earthquake and emergency planning 
experts: The First Step  
</P>
<P>
 The most significant step in getting ready for the next crisis, Lafferty said, 
is the first one: Stand back and assess your company's situation. What things 
are most crucial to the business? Which employees, suppliers, customers, 
equipment and information would be absolutely necessary to a bare-bones 
operation in the days immediately after a crisis? Where is the company 
vulnerable -- its physical plant, its lack of supplies, its lack of backup 
systems? 
</P>
<P>
 Once you've studied your strengths and weaknesses, you have the basics for a 
plan of action. Your first job is to set priorities: Make sure the most 
important things will be preserved or duplicated; whatever needs fixing, begin 
now, said Ian Mitroff, director of USC's Center for Crisis Management. 
</P>
<P>
 The next steps vary in cost and difficulty. No-Cost Things  
</P>
<P>
 * Determine what local government and emergency agencies are prepared to do. 
But then count on going it alone for the first hours or days of a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't depend on these agencies to take care of you right away," Lafferty 
said. "They can only do so much and might not be where you are. It's important 
that everybody assume responsibility for themselves, especially for the first 
few days." 
</P>
<P>
 * Draw up your own emergency plan. Discuss problems and options with key 
personnel, determine each person's role and responsibilities and designate 
alternates for those people. Put together a phone tree, including each 
employee's phone number and an emergency contact for each person. 
</P>
<P>
 Designate one phone number (preferably with an answering machine attached) for 
employees to call during the emergency to learn if and when they are needed to 
return. Decide on at least one alternate phone number or out-of-state contact 
(a relative will do) in case local telephone service is disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 Decide on a site that could become a mini "command post," said Bill 
Regensburger, director of emergency planning at USC. "Create a little 
checklist. You know that at the time (an emergency) happens, you're going to 
forget most of the things you should do. Right now, it's probably fresh in your 
mind, so write it down and put it in a red folder where everybody knows where 
it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Staudenmeir, of the computer risk management group at accounting firm 
Arthur Andersen, said it is vital to keep emergency plans up to date and test 
them regularly. "Most plans almost never work the first time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Talk to your customers and suppliers. Discuss the possibilities of 
disruption and arrange emergency communication and distribution options. Talk 
to your suppliers about their plans for coping with emergencies; ask about 
their backup systems. Know of other suppliers that can be called upon if your 
suppliers are knocked out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take advantage of free services and information. Much is available from 
local organizations and government agencies. The Governor's Office of Emergency 
Services offers workshops, brochures, handouts, posters and sample emergency 
plans. For these services in the Los Angeles area, call (818) 304-8383. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make arrangements with various contractors or professionals. Those you might 
need in the first hours or days of an emergency include building engineers, 
attorneys and accountants. Include their phone numbers on your list. 
</P>
<P>
 * Get to know others in your line of business. With them, you could establish 
a mutual aid network. Join or form an association; join a civic organization. 
Discuss possible emergencies and what resources could be shared if needed. 
Things That Cost Little  
</P>
<P>
 * Obtain emergency preparedness supplies. Many cost next to nothing. There are 
restraints, or "lips," that can be placed on shelves to help keep items from 
falling off during an earthquake; a simple wire across glass items (as in a 
grocery or liquor store) would help prevent much damage. Latches can keep 
storage doors from flying open. There are devices for keeping computer monitors 
securely on desks and tables. Make sure your fire extinguishers are checked 
regularly and that employees know how to use them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Review work areas and get rid of hazards. Pull down heavy items stored on 
upper shelves and find another spot for them. A new product clips onto heavy 
artwork and secures it to the wall. Bolt shelves and files to walls. Have 
safety plastic installed on large windows (or do it yourself) to keep the glass 
from shattering. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember that many insurers offer discounts for improved safety measures. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep a certain number of emergency supplies on hand. Include first aid kits, 
water, flashlights or other light sources, batteries, battery-operated radios 
and other basic items. 
</P>
<P>
 * Help employees become prepared at work and at home. You could start by 
supplying each employee with a flashlight and emergency preparedness 
guidelines. Consider providing safety training. Encourage all employees to have 
their own away-from-home stash of emergency supplies, either at their desks or 
in their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you cannot afford computer system backup services, create your own. 
Consider having employees keep duplicate copies of their important files at 
home. Routinely back up computer data and files and store these copies 
off-site. Some small-business managers train themselves to pop in a floppy disk 
at the end of each day, copy files and information and carry it home with them; 
your business' data might need to be backed up only weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 Vital files and programs should be copied and stored in more than one spot and 
in fire-safe containers. Consider out-of-state storage of the most important 
records, USC's Mitroff said, and remember that not just computer records should 
be copied; copies of important legal documents should also be stored at a safe 
distance. Things That Cost More  
</P>
<P>
 * Consider buying backup generators (and any extension cords you might need) 
and cellular phones. Loss of power and telecommunications is always a threat in 
a natural or even human-caused disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hot" and "cold" backup services are available, but may be too expensive and, 
in some cases, unnecessary. Hot sites have computer systems ready and waiting 
to operate for you; cold sites can be empty spaces wired and ready for computer 
and telecommunications systems. If your business has more than one location, 
you can imitate these services by distributing your data and systems among your 
various sites. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look into business interruption insurance. While such insurance does not 
help you recover lost time or information, such policies do cover losses of 
income from disasters after a prescribed period. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you can, consider providing employees with the resources they need to 
return to work. This could range from hiring cleaning crews for them to 
providing transportation, temporary housing, loans, food and clothing and 
trauma counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consider new ways of doing business. If your assessment of your 
vulnerability is just plain frightening, now may be the time to implement new 
work methods and technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 It might be time to plunge into the computer age and buy that PC for yourself 
or the office. If your business couldn't exist without the little printing 
company down the street and you've discovered it has no emergency plan in 
place, weigh that risk against the cost of your own computerized desktop 
publishing system. A new "notebook" computer for key employees and accounts 
might be less expensive in the long run than your current system.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; WEEK 2: RATTLED, BUT REOPENING; SOUTH-CENTRAL'S 
FOUNDERS BANK FACES TASK OF REBUILDING ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reorganized as a bank in 1991 from the ashes of a failed savings and loan, 
Founders National Bank's mission has been to help capital-starved South-Central 
Los Angeles businesses and residents pick themselves up by their bootstraps. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's the bank that needs a lift. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's earthquake hammered the bank's main offices in South-Central Los 
Angeles, causing severe structural damage and delaying the bank's expansion and 
lending plans. Founders President Carlton Jenkins and other employees have been 
racing to keep the bank running after city inspectors on Wednesday declared the 
headquarters building unsafe and ordered it evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, virtually everything must be moved -- quickly -- including the bank's 
teller operations, loan department, customer records and a central computer 
that runs its automated-teller system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to cry when I saw the damage (Monday morning) because I knew 
what it would mean to us in terms of a business interruption," Jenkins said. 
"It was just so demoralizing to see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding insult to injury, the bank last week was slated to celebrate its third 
anniversary as California's only black-owned bank. A party Thursday night for 
hundreds of employees, supporters and community leaders to celebrate the 
anniversary had to be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins sees the calamity as a temporary setback rather than a crippling blow. 
Aside from the inconvenience to customers of its headquarters and main branch 
on West Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, who will have to travel to another of 
its three branches, customers shouldn't notice any disruption of service, 
Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bank's plans for adding new branches in 1994 and expanding its lending 
programs will be hampered. The bank had planned to unveil a home lending 
program this month, but that will be delayed, Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bank is a lender of first resort or last resort for many people," 
Jenkins said. "For every dollar that doesn't come in here, it means $15 less in 
lending we can do for the community." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Jenkins added, "our employees are safe. Nobody got hurt, 
and we're just going to keep going." 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins estimates that repairs to the two-story headquarters and branch will 
cost up to $600,000 and will take three to six months. Meanwhile, Jenkins has 
transferred 40 corporate office employees and lots of equipment to the three 
other branches. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many small- and medium-sized businesses, Founders had opted not to buy 
earthquake insurance because of the expensive premiums. The bank has the cash 
to pay for the damage, Jenkins said, but may seek federal or private loan 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The corporate largess that Founders received following the Los Angeles riots 
of 1992 -- as businesses sought to aid the city's rebuilding efforts -- could 
help Founders' own rebuilding efforts now. Atlantic Richfield, the Automobile 
Club of California, State Farm Insurance and Bank of America have invested a 
total of $4 million in Founders. The bank has $92 million in assets and is 
financially strong, Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank got a big scare Wednesday when the Department of Water and Power 
wanted to shut off power to the building after inspectors deemed it unsafe. 
That would have forced Founders to completely cease operations, since the 
bank's main computer is still there. Founders quickly contacted Los Angeles 
City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who persuaded DWP officials to keep the 
power on until the computer can be moved. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage to the building could have been much worse. Two months ago, as part of 
ongoing renovations to the 1960s-era structure, Founders replaced the 
building's glass walls with concrete block. Without that change, engineers told 
Jenkins, the structure might have collapsed in the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 The recovery process has been a little easier because the bank had an 
emergency disaster plan, though Jenkins said the plan was designed with riots, 
not earthquakes, in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Moss, president of the men's group at the Bethel African Methodist 
Episcopal Church in Los Angeles, says the community won't let Founders founder. 
</P>
<P>
 "A black bank in the black community will survive and still meet the needs of 
the people," he said. "The community will come to Founders and help them the 
way they did last time," after the 1992 riots.

TURMOIL ROILS TOKYO MARKETS, MAY STALL RECOVERY; JAPAN: HOSOKAWA'S ECONOMIC 
STIMULUS PLAN IS IN TROUBLE; THE PRIME MINISTER MAY LOSE HIS JOB. STOCKS PLUNGE 
IN EARLY TRADING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Pessimism sparked by the defeat late last week of Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's anti-corruption political reform package prompted a sharp plunge in 
Tokyo stocks early today. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa's setback in Parliament clouds prospects for quick passage of an 
economic stimulus program, which investors have counted on to jump-start 
Japan's stagnant economy. Political disarray in Tokyo also poses new 
difficulties for the resolution of U.S.-Japan trade disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa's fragile, seven-party coalition government has been drawing up a 
$120-billion program of public works outlays, other spending programs, 
deregulation measures and income tax cuts aimed at pulling Japan out of its 
worst postwar recession. 
</P>
<P>
 But action has been delayed by the priority given to the anti-corruption 
political reform package and by a split in the ruling coalition over whether 
income tax cuts should be balanced by a consumption tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hosokawa cabinet's inability to quickly enact a stimulus program adds to 
already deep gloom about the economy's short-term prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tokyo Stock Exchange was closed Friday when Parliament's upper house voted 
down the political reform. In mid-afternoon trading today, the Nikkei was down 
842.58 points, or 4.4%, to 18,464.85. An equivalent drop in U.S. markets would 
shave 168.32 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which starts the week 
at 3914.48. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest reason for the decline is the failure of the political reform 
bills in the Upper House," noted Tomoatsu Yamamuro, a trader at Yamaichi 
Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
 After plunging during the final months of last year, Tokyo stocks had risen 
sharply in recent weeks on investment by foreign bargain-hunters and 
expectations that a stimulus package might finally set the economy on a path 
toward renewed growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "U.S. pension funds and mutual funds (have been) buying Japanese shares," 
Tetsuo Tanimura, vice president at CS First Boston (Japan), explained earlier 
this month, while the market was rising. "It would be too late after signs of 
economic recovery are seen." 
</P>
<P>
 The relative optimism of foreign investors continued this morning. "The 
encouraging thing is that foreigners are not changing their positions as net 
buyers," commented a trader at a foreign securities firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Widespread Japanese sentiment was reflected in comments after Friday's vote by 
Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Federation of Corporate Executives. "I 
feel absolutely frustrated," he said. "Japan will suffer if, in a political 
vacuum, something is not done about the economic slump." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration also is worried about the potential effects of 
political turmoil in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington hoped that Hosokawa's reform-minded administration would push broad 
deregulation of Japan's economy and nurture greater receptivity to imports. But 
those expectations are now threatened by the possibility that the prime 
minister himself will be out of office within weeks, either through resignation 
or a decision to call new parliamentary elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa had hoped to achieve passage of political reforms on Friday and 
announce an economic stimulus program this week. The idea was to have both 
packages firmly in hand before meeting President Clinton Feb. 11 in a 
trade-oriented summit. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime minister still has that aim, even if political reform has to be 
watered down and economic policies need to be patched together amid political 
confusion. But Hosokawa may arrive in Washington without either one. There also 
is great uncertainty whether any significant bilateral trade agreements will be 
ready for signing at the summit. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd M. Bentsen, visiting Tokyo, said Sunday that the 
trade talks could fail to produce acceptable results. In that case, the United 
States may take a more forceful approach to prying open Japanese markets, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A failed summit could lead to U.S. efforts to promote a stronger yen -- and 
that would hurt Japan's ability to export. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington could also decide to impose trade sanctions if other measures prove 
unsuccessful in boosting U.S. exports to Japan and reducing the bilateral trade 
imbalance, which hit about $50 billion last year. Any such measures would 
further chill prospects for recovery in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa will try again this week to reach a compromise with the opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party to allow passage of a revised set of reform bills. 
</P>
<P>
 But attempts at compromise could put further strains on his own coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Government ministries and ruling coalition parties are currently working on 
the budget, but their efforts will not be 100% as long as the political reform 
bills are pending," Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, a key coalition figure, 
acknowledged after defeat of the original reform proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa's cabinet was already behind schedule in preparing a budget for the 
1994 fiscal year, which begins April 1. Many of the proposed stimulus measures 
are intended to go into this budget.  
</P>
<P>
 With the ruling parties in disarray, it is unclear when the government can 
focus on the economy. Should a general election be called, strong economic 
measures could be postponed for months.

FOOTNOTES /JAMES BATES: EARTHQUAKE AFTERSCHLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JAMES BATES

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not even a major earthquake could damage Southern California's publicity 
infrastructure. Some of the highlights from the past week: 
</P>
<P>
 * A San Fernando Valley health food specialist announced a plant-derived 
remedy is available for "post-earthquake stress" that she claims works because 
"people just stop being frightened, and they will feel much, much better." 
</P>
<P>
 * Woodland Hills-based 20th Century Insurance Co. announced "casual dress is 
appropriate" for its employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The company later updated its apparel edict with a bulletin saying casual 
dress is all right at four offices, but other locations "are requested to 
observe the company's normal business attire requirements." 
</P>
<P>
 * A Calabasas mortgage company invited photographers to snap pictures of 
employees using hair dryers to blow hot air on water-soaked documents. 
</P>
<P>
 * In a "Make My Day"-like boast, Pacific Bell said, "Three days after staring 
down Southern California's most serious earthquake, Pacific Bell's network is 
offering Angelenos a detour around collapsed freeways and buckled roads." Art 
of the 'Huh?' 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly lost amid all of the earthquake news last week was the disclosure by 
New York developer/newlywed Donald Trump that he won't bid on the Aladdin hotel 
in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Trump had been expected to bid on the hotel, but passed, saying the price 
would be too high. 
</P>
<P>
 In justifying his decision, Trump was quoted in one interview as saying: "Now 
with the earthquake, people stop going to Las Vegas. Maybe I turned out to be 
right." Foot in La Bouche 
</P>
<P>
 One of the bigger earthquake-related gaffes was made by Daniel Toscan du 
Plantier. He's a French government official active in his nation's film 
industry, which has been battling Hollywood over restrictions on American 
movies shown in France. 
</P>
<P>
 According to French press accounts, Toscan du Plantier made light of the 
earthquake when he said: "And now with the earthquake that's hitting Hollywood 
and the San Fernando Valley, where numerous studios can be found, one knows 
that God, who rarely reveals himself, is at work. And he's chosen his side." 
</P>
<P>
 The accounts add that an embarrassed Toscan du Plantier hurried to retract his 
comments after the media reported them. Other News 
</P>
<P>
 Not all news was earthquake related. Some of the morsels that may have escaped 
public attention last week included a disclosure by the Quaker Oats Co. that it 
sold 5.7 million pounds of oatmeal in one week during the deep freeze in the 
Midwest and East. Quaker said that was up 60% from early January. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Tiffany & Co. announced it has finished working on the Vince Lombardi 
Super Bowl Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the Pest Control Operators of California announced a training program 
to get ready for what may well turn out to be California's next the natural 
disaster -- the invasion of "killer" bees. 
</P>
<P>
 One group official said "fighting killer bees is a whole new ball of wax."

NBC TO KEEP PROGRAMMING CHIEF; TELEVISION: THE MOVE ENDS TALK OF WARREN 
LITTLEFIELD LEAVING. NETWORK HAS SEEN RATINGS GAINS THIS SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 NBC, on a ratings rebound after several years mired in third place, has 
renewed the contract of programming chief Warren Littlefield for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The renewal ends speculation that Littlefield would leave the network.The talk 
began after NBC President Robert C. Wright recruited producer Don Ohlmeyer to 
oversee the program division last year. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC is the only network to post gains this season in all three key ratings 
categories: overall households, adults 18 to 49, and adults 25 to 54. Much of 
the gain has come from renewed strength on Thursday nights with the hits 
"Seinfeld" and "Frasier." 
</P>
<P>
 Littlefield acknowledged the uncertainty about his future after Ohlmeyer was 
named president of NBC West Coast, effectively adding a new layer of management 
between him and NBC executives in New York. The appointment was widely seen as 
a move by Wright to halt the ratings slide at the network in the wake of 
previous programming chief Brandon Tartikoff's departure two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither of us knew how it would progress," Littlefield said. "But it's worked 
out well. And I'm having fun again." 
</P>
<P>
 NBC is currently developing shows for next season. Littlefield said NBC will 
order about 15 comedy pilots and about eight drama pilots from which to pick 
the fall's prime-time schedule. He estimated the network will replace four to 
five hours of programming.

 Taiwan Will Cut Trade Barriers, Report Says: The China Times said that three 
days of talks last week between the United States and Taiwan ended with the 
Taipei government agreeing to cut tariffs on more than 70 industrial products

become part of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

LIFETIME EMPLOYMENT FADING FAST IN JAPAN; EMPLOYMENT: TOYOTA WILL HIRE 
DESIGNERS ON CONTRACT -- A NEW SIGN OF EROSION IN JAPAN'S SYSTEM OF LIFETIME 
JOBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a new assault on Japan's slowly eroding system of lifetime employment, 
Toyota Motor Corp. says it will begin hiring experienced automotive designers 
on a contract basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, such work has been done by permanent employees hired after college 
graduation who worked their way up in the company. But the new employees -- who 
may be of any age and nationality -- will be hired on the basis of experience 
and offered merit-based rather than seniority-based pay increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Erosion of long-term job security has become a topic of intense public concern 
in Japan. Faced with the most prolonged recession in decades, companies are 
looking for new ways to reduce costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Firing workers is generally seen as socially unacceptable and is usually 
considered a measure of last resort. But programs such as the one Toyota is 
launching -- a variation on the worldwide trend toward less-than-permanent work 
forces -- would shift a growing portion of new employment to positions carrying 
no guarantees against termination. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, for a prestigious corporation like Toyota to take the step makes it 
easier for others to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
 At Toyota, the newcomers will be offered one-year contracts that can be 
extended up to five years. They are expected to "propose novel designs and 
revitalize the whole company with unconventional ideas," the company said in 
announcing the program Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 While the experimental program will initially involve only a small number of 
new hires, the company is portraying the new policy as a step toward broader 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "To respond flexibly to the further globalization of business in the coming 
years, it is essential that corporations adopt a diverse employment system," 
Toyota's statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newly hired automotive designers will have a first-year salary of about 
$90,000 -- an amount usually attained by the firm's white-collar workers only 
after about 15 years on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The designers will receive "appropriate upward adjustments . . . depending on 
results," the company said. If performance is impressive enough, their pay 
could double in the second year, Toyota spokesman Naoto Fuse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a pay system would differ drastically from that applied to lifetime 
employees, who receive incremental annual increases based more on seniority 
than merit. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials say the new system may eventually be applied to about 10% of 
white-collar hires. 
</P>
<P>
 While most Japanese appear comfortable with the existing employment system, 
talented and ambitious individuals sometimes find it a source of immense 
frustration. People in their mid-30s, for example, cannot hold high positions 
or receive especially large salaries, regardless of how well they do their 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a survey conducted last year by the Japan Productivity Center, 89% of 
responding firms said they favored lifetime employment in principle. But only 
56% said they actually guaranteed jobs until retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 As to the merits of the system, 83% said it helped them secure and train 
employees and 79% said it offered psychological stability to their workers. But 
63% said it locked in inflexible personnel costs.

sales, profits, employment, prices and inventories, Dun & Bradstreet said in 
its quarterly survey of business expectations. The first-quarter study for 
fiscal 1994 shows that 67% of companies surveyed expect to see sales rise; 10% 
said they expect a decline. Expectations are strongest for non-durable goods,

 Mercedes-Benz Sales Up Sharply: Sales of the luxury cars and trucks in China 
soared to $313.6 million in 1993, representing a nearly tenfold increase since 
1991, the German auto maker said. The Daimler-Benz subsidiary said Chinese 
customers bought 5,000 cars, mostly top-of-the-line S-Class units, and 300 
commercial vehicles last year. The totals in 1991 were 400 cars and 130 
commercial vehicles, which generated revenue of $33.9 million.

 Bonnie Benton is a consultant. But unlike many of her peers, whose 
self-employment began when companies cut them loose during the recession, 
Benton launched her business by choice in the midst of a boom. 
</P>
<P>
 With a background as a real estate agent and sales and marketing strategist 
for a number of major home builders and developers -- including Mission Viejo 
Co. and J.M. Peters Co. -- Benton jumped the corporate ship in 1987 to start 
her own business. And despite a four-year recession that has ravaged Southern 
California's development industry, she says she hasn't looked back. 
</P>
<P>
 She has survived the economic crunch by "being lucky enough to have some 
pretty good clients to start with, companies that realized they needed more 
information as times got bad. And my background enabled me to be flexible as 
the economy and clients' needs changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Benton also did something that many would-be entrepreneurs fail to do: She 
identified a niche and filled it well. She did so with a plethora of 
professional contacts, a willingness to get out and talk to the people who buy 
and sell real estate, and a powerful personal computer linked by telephone to 
numerous commercial databases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many small businesses don't establish a well-defined target market, and 
if you try to spread yourself over a huge area you won't have the expertise to 
do it all," said Judee Slack, a Westminster tax consultant and president of the 
local chapter of the National Assn. of Women Business Owners. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many much bigger real estate analysis companies than Benton's in 
Southern California. But, working from a home office in Laguna Niguel, Benton 
sets herself apart by tackling what she calls "the extraneous, odd studies that 
a client probably wouldn't get from the larger, more generalist type of 
consulting firm." 
</P>
<P>
 Benton has prospered by giving her clients highly customized and personalized 
service and by offering a unique perspective on the market. Her clients -- 
builders, developers, banks and other marketing and consulting firms -- deal 
largely in the new-home industry. To that, Benton brings an understanding of 
the interplay between the resale and new-home markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people in the new-home industry ignore the resale market, and they don't 
look very far away from their location. I want to give my clients an even 
better picture of what the market really is in terms of competition and price." 
</P>
<P>
 So a Benton study is characterized by an analysis of new-home competition on a 
broad regional basis and by an in-depth look at what is going on in the same 
region's resale market. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulling up resale data, she said, gives her the ability to tell her clients 
things like the ethnic makeup of the area from which customers are likely to 
come, the age of the existing housing stock, the size of lots and homes in the 
area, and the prices of homes that buyers might consider as alternatives to the 
client's product. 
</P>
<P>
 All of that helps the client decide exactly what to build and how to focus 
advertising, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 A builder planning a typical 1990s tract of 2,500-square-foot homes on 
3,000-square-foot lots, for example, needs to know if there are four other 
new-homes tracts in the area and what those projects offer in terms of price, 
lot size and product style. 
</P>
<P>
 But the builder also needs to know if all of the surrounding existing homes 
are small, 20 years old and built on big 6,000- to 7,000-square-foot lots, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That tells you that your project, if you build it as planned, will be way too 
big for the area. The people who might buy won't want to live in that 
neighborhood," Benton said. "And people in the neighborhood who might be 
tempted to move up might decide that it's less expensive to add on to their 
existing homes and keep their big lots." 
</P>
<P>
 Benton said that the hardest part of running her own business has been time 
management. In the early days, she said, she would often burn herself out by 
putting in 12- and 15-hour days. Even now she figures that she averages 65 
hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Her smartest move? "I forced myself to take the time to learn how to use my 
computer, and I keep abreast of the software that is useful in what I do. It's 
what keeps me in business, because with it I can do the work of three people." 
</P>
<P>
 Benton said she now it tackling one of the toughest decisions of her career. 
She has reached the limits of what she can do as a one-woman firm and must 
decide whether to draw a line and go no further or to expand -- which would 
mean hiring a full-time staff and diluting the personal service she now gives.

Q & A: SHENA CRANE; AUTHOR OF "WHAT DO I DO NOW? MAKING SENSE OF TODAY'S 
CHANGING WORKPLACE" 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Debora Vrana, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shena Crane, founder and president of Mentor Career Services in Irvine, is a 
career strategist who helps people find jobs and manage careers in an 
increasingly tight job market. She is the author of a new book that will be in 
local bookstores this week. Crane, 44, gleaned her information while getting 
her MBA from UC Irvine and working for 16 years in the corporate world as a 
marketing vice president for three companies. She recently spoke with Times 
correspondent Debora Vrana. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There is a plethora of how-to books about job hunting. What's special about 
yours, "What Do I Do Now? Making Sense of Today's Changing Workplace"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: My book is different for several reasons. First of all, I have 16 years of 
experience in the workplace and an MBA. I have a practical background. I think 
there is nothing wrong with books written by counselors and psychologists, but 
I think they are coming at it from a different perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 The other thing is that my book is written to address what has happened in the 
workplace in the past couple of years. Basically since the 1990 recession, the 
workplace has changed dramatically, and it has changed permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 The kind of career advice people were getting before, even in 1988, really 
isn't applicable anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 So what I tried to do is make it a pop volume in the sense of taking big 
academic business volumes and synthesizing the information into an every-person 
sort of book, a book that says everything has changed and this is what you need 
to do.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What has happened in theworkplace in the past fewyears? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Some major things have happened. Obviously everyone knows we've downsized, 
and the different thing about it this time is we have downsized permanently. 
Companies are stripping back to what it is they basically do, and they are 
outsourcing everything else. So things like accounting, advertising, marketing 
and public relations are going to people whose business that is. 
</P>
<P>
 People have stripped companies down to just the people who really have to be 
there. So what you're seeing is that a "womb to tomb" type of career is gone. 
Instead, your career is going to be a series of working for someone else, 
working for a small company, working on your own and going back and forth 
between all of those." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You mentioned that workers need to think of their careers as a business. 
How does a person do that?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think in the past careers were something that happened to you. You got 
hired somewhere, then you got hired somewhere else, and we actually got used to 
the fact that our employers would take care of us. 
</P>
<P>
 These days I don't think you need to be disloyal to your employers, but you 
really need to think of yourself as a business leader. Because when your 
employer lays off 30 people it's not so much that it's a personal decision, 
it's a business decision. 
</P>
<P>
 You have to have that for yourself, too. You have to say, "OK, I'm with this 
company. Is it good for me to stay here? Would it be better for me to go off 
and do something else?"  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are the mistakes a worker could make in managing his or her career in 
this radically shifting job market? 
</P>
<P>
 A: People who won't recognize that things have changed. For example, if they 
are working for a company, and that company has sold off a division or laid off 
people, you can't put your head in the sand and say, "This won't happen to me." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the mistakes is a refusal to see what is going on. You need to face up 
to what's happened. 
</P>
<P>
 I know someone who recently got laid off in the computer industry and decided 
to open up a dance studio, something he had always wanted to do. You need that 
type of thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about a worker who has only worked for one or two companies, let's say 
an aerospace worker in his late 40s or 50s, who is laid off? How does he 
suddenly get the courage to open a dance studio? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's hard. Usually what happens is that people go out there and look for 
something in their field. 
</P>
<P>
 They call a couple of recruiters, do the classic things you used to do. 
Unfortunately, it gets to the point when they say, "This isn't working. I don't 
know why, but this isn't working." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people are very good at looking at a situation and deciding, "OK, this is 
what I need to do," while others are stuck in the mud.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We've been talking about older workers, but what about the 20-somethings, 
someone entering this workplace for the first time?  
</P>
<P>
 A: They are in a Catch-22 because we are telling them "you need lots of 
education," which has gotten more costly. And at the same time, they are 
getting out of school and there are no jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The thing I've found that helps is that you can do internships after you 
graduate, and you can create your own internship program. 
</P>
<P>
 You can send a company a letter explaining what you would do. This can lead to 
a full-time job.  
</P>
<P>
 Also you don't have to work for the bigger companies. There are opportunities 
in the smaller companies.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are the skills workers need to survive in this new environment? 
</P>
<P>
 A: They need to constantly be training. You need to have the ability to learn 
and to communicate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Your book talks about cultural diversity in the workplace. Explain that. 
</P>
<P>
 A: A lot of companies are starting to have diversification programs, basically 
teaching different types of people to get along. 
</P>
<P>
 Often minorities are not hired for career track positions. Some companies now 
are having mentoring programs -- like Xerox is identifying what the career 
track is and hiring minorities for those programs. 
</P>
<P>
 These are programs a worker needs to be aware of. By 2005, minorities and 
women will outnumber white males in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On her new book. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just limited to job search. It's about career management, and the 
point I try to make is that people need to look at their own careers as a 
business -- and make decisions accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On staying motivated during a job search. . . 
</P>
<P>
 One of the problems is that you don't know when it's going to end. You can't 
control it, so you just need to take things one day at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On keeping busy while job hunting. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "While looking, you can do interim jobs. I've had CEOs who have worked in 
sales at Kmart. People know how the economy is, and they will respect you for 
keeping bread on the table. It's much better than sitting around the house in 
your bathrobe." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the workplace of the future. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to see more of the 'contingency work force,' the temporary 
workers and independent contractors hired for certain projects."

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: CIRCUS CIRCUS INVESTORS ARE NOT AMUSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Has Wall Street's once-favorite casino operator lost its hot hand? 
</P>
<P>
 That's the question dogging Circus Circus Enterprises, the Nevada gaming giant 
that has helped lead Las Vegas' transformation from Sin City to family resort. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday, Circus' stock plunged $2.25 a share after the company said the 
general manager of its new Luxor hotel/casino in Las Vegas, William J. Paulos, 
had quit. Friday, the stock eased further, losing 37.5 cents to $36.50. 
</P>
<P>
 While shares of Circus' big gaming rivals -- such as Caesars World, Hilton 
Hotels and Mirage Resorts -- are hovering near all-time highs, Circus' stock 
has tumbled 27% since peaking at $49.75 in October, just before it opened 
Luxor. 
</P>
<P>
 Circus investors appear spooked by two major concerns: 
</P>
<P>
 * A bad-mouthing of Luxor among Wall Streeters who have stayed there -- and 
apparently by many other guests as well. Critics of the $400-million 
pyramid-shaped hotel say the elevators are inadequate, the service often 
slothlike and the layout too puzzling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a gorgeous exterior, but they compromised on the interior," said Michael 
Mueller, analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, in a common 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street has also trashed Circus' pink-domed "adventuresphere" amusement 
park that opened in August next to the company's flagship Circus Circus casino, 
at the other end of Vegas' Strip from Luxor. "That thing was almost a waste of 
$75 million," one gaming industry analyst fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 * The continuing revolving door in Circus' executive suite. Luxor's Paulos is 
the fifth senior Circus officer to quit since 1991. A year ago, Glenn 
Schaeffer, Circus' president and heir-apparent to iron-willed Chairman William 
G. Bennett, was forced out after challenging Bennett's authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street's fear is that Bennett, 69, is jeopardizing the company's future 
by sending talented managers packing. Though institutional investors' doubts 
about Bennett are tempered by their awe over the wealth he has created (Circus 
shares, adjusted for splits, have risen 15-fold since 1984), the loss of 
earnings momentum this year is eroding support for him. 
</P>
<P>
 According to analysts' consensus estimate, Circus will earn $1.47 a share in 
the fiscal year ending next Monday, up just 4% from 1992 after growing an 
average 25% annually since 1987. Revenue is expected to hit a record $1 billion 
for fiscal 1993, fed by Luxor and by Circus' other major hotel/casinos in 
Vegas, Reno and Laughlin, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Friday, Bennett, suffering from a sore throat but otherwise 
feisty, conceded that Circus has had problems with the Egyptian-themed Luxor, 
especially with the elevator-inclinators that travel the four corners of the 
30-story, 2,526-room pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also expressed surprise -- and concern -- that criticism of the hotel 
has continued. "I understood we had this solved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Service complaints in particular rankle Bennett, who has built Circus largely 
by fostering "great customer loyalty," as he puts it. Told of one guest who 
waited 40 minutes for a beer in a Luxor restaurant on a recent Friday, Bennett 
admitted, "That stinks." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if guests don't like Luxor, it isn't yet apparent in the resort's 
financial performance, Bennett said. The hotel's occupancy has been topping 
90%, with many sellouts. More important, the gaming take in Luxor's opulent 
casino has apparently beaten projections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Financially, Luxor has been performing better than expected. We're very happy 
with the bottom line," Bennett said. In addition, he said, Luxor's tourist 
allure has raised traffic at Circus' 3 1/2-year-old, 4,000-room Medieval-themed 
Excalibur hotel/casino next door. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the Strip, at the company's aging Circus Circus property, Bennett 
concedes that the addition of the Grand Slam Canyon "adventuresphere" in August 
didn't provide the expected boost in family business. Critics say that, with 
just two major rides, the dome is a dud. "We're working now on getting some 
additional things in there," Bennett said without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street -- disappointed in the slowdown at the Circus Circus property and 
the weakness in Laughlin (hurt by Vegas' must-see status, with Luxor, Treasure 
Island and the MGM Grand resorts all new) -- had been counting on strength at 
Luxor and Excalibur to restore Circus' earnings growth. 
</P>
<P>
 And indeed, Bennett said, "We thought we were going to have a very strong 
(fourth) quarter." 
</P>
<P>
 Until, that was, last Monday's deadly earthquake in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, "attendance (in Vegas) has dropped off enough that we are 
concerned about it," Bennett said. Normally, about 15% of Circus' business 
comes from the L.A. area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the uncertainty, Bennett declined to say whether analysts' earnings 
projections (the consensus is $2.02 per share for 1994) are still reasonable. 
If Los Angeles stays depressed, "I've got to figure out how to get more people 
from the Midwest in here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What about the departure of Paulos, Luxor's manager? Some Vegas insiders say 
Bennett had grown unhappy with Paulos, but whether that stemmed from complaints 
about Luxor isn't clear. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the job Paulos took -- chief operating officer of a new casino 
development in Australia -- gives him a higher-profile post than he had at 
Circus. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett scoffs at talk that he's stifling executive development, driving good 
people out. "The real story is that our executives are good enough to get these 
kinds of deals" from rivals, he said. Investors needn't worry about succession 
at Circus, he says. "We have a lot of good people here." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Circus' investors give Bennett the benefit of the doubt. "He's 
irascible, but he's a genius, too," said Jim Mair, research chief at Roger 
Engemann & Associates, a Pasadena money manager that owns 4.6 million Circus 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
 With the stock at $36.50 now, or 18 times estimated 1994 earnings, "I'm sort 
of a roaring bull on it," Mair said. Hilton shares, by contrast, are priced at 
25 times '94 estimates; Mirage is at 21 times. 
</P>
<P>
 The near-term risk, however, is that Nevada-dependent Circus could be hurt 
worse than rivals by the Southland's new misery. 
</P>
<P>
 And longer term, with Bennett's plans to develop Circus casinos in new 
jurisdictions -- including Canada, Australia and on the Mississippi River -- 
the company's need for talented managers will intensify. 
</P>
<P>
 If Luxor's growing pains, Paulos' exit and the misstep with Grand Slam Canyon 
are symptoms of a bigger problem in Circus' executive suite, Wall Street may 
just be beginning to affix a lower valuation to this long-vaunted franchise.

broadcasting stations like PBS to computer makers like E-Systems and Cray 
Research to government entities such as NASA and NATO. Financially, the company 
looks equally attractive: a current ratio of 3.0, predicted 1994 revenues of 
$86 million, a long-term debt to capitalization ratio of 0.55 and a price to 
sales ratio of 0.58. Fiscal 1993 was the company's 23rd consecutive year of 
profitability."

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: CONTRARIANS OFFERING A WAY TO HEDGE YOUR BET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are ways to protect yourself against a possible stock market plunge 
without having to stash your cash under a mattress. 
</P>
<P>
 One strategy might be to invest in a mutual fund that's positioned to profit 
the next time stock prices tumble. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of taking a defensive posture with mutual funds is nothing new. 
Several well-known portfolios enjoy leeway to flee to the safety of cash when 
their managers think the market is ready to sink. 
</P>
<P>
 But a few aggressively contrarian funds are more than just defensive -- 
they're actually looking to reap big profits from falling stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
 How do they hope to accomplish this? By stocking up on gold shares, using 
futures and options to exploit a broad market decline and selling individual 
stocks short. 
</P>
<P>
 A short sale, the most radical of the three approaches, is the opposite of a 
regular or "long" transaction. The idea is to sell borrowed shares now at what 
you think is a high price. Then you pray the stock tumbles, allowing you to buy 
the shares at a lower price, repay the loan and close out the position at a 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
 The most notable new entrant in the small field of funds that do much shorting 
is Robertson-Stephens Contrarian of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 This fund has raised $200 million since its debut in late June. It returned 
11.9% during the second half of 1993, about four points better than the average 
stock fund. 
</P>
<P>
 In designing the portfolio, manager Paul Stephens said he wanted to maintain 
maximum flexibility to move among different asset categories. Although the fund 
can make major bets either in favor of or against the stock market, the current 
position is downright bearish. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, the fund's holdings include: 
</P>
<P>
 * A 25% stake in growth gold mining companies, reflecting gold's reputation as 
a hedge against inflation and social uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another 25% in stocks sold short -- notably niche beverage companies, 
restaurant chains and high-flying technology stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 16% in the common shares of nickel, aluminum and copper stocks, which also 
would be expected to fare well if higher inflation returned. 
</P>
<P>
 * 15% in cash (Treasury bills), a low-risk investment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 6% in real estate stocks, another potential beneficiary of higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 4% in put options on the Standard & Poor's 500 index, which would surge in 
value if the stock market dived. 
</P>
<P>
 * 2% in call options on gold stocks, which would hit pay dirt if the 
underlying shares rallied. 
</P>
<P>
 With this mix, Stephens is making a major bet that the decade-long trend 
toward low interest rates, low inflation and higher stock prices will soon 
reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you don't agree with this forecast -- and it's worth emphasizing that 
the stock market has been very kind to loyal investors over longer periods -- 
Stephens feels his portfolio is a good way to hedge your other mutual fund 
holdings without having to sell them. 
</P>
<P>
 He views Robertson-Stephens Contrarian ((800) 288-7726) as a lower-cost, 
lower-minimum alternative to private hedge funds, which are limited 
partnerships designed for high-end investors -- typically those with $250,000 
or more to spare. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the salient features of private hedge funds is that their managers 
typically take a 20% cut of any profits, says Stephens, who runs some hedge 
partnerships himself. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Robertson-Stephens Contrarian is open to investors with $5,000 or 
more ($1,000 and up for individual retirement accounts), and there's no 20% cut 
on profits. Stephens said the Securities and Exchange Commission wouldn't allow 
that on mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 It's important to note, however, that Robertson-Stephens Contrarian isn't 
cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 Management expects that annual operating expenses will run about 2.75%, about 
double the norm for stock funds. Although there's no front-end sales charge, 
the expense ratio does include a 0.75% annual marketing fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the mutual fund most similar to Robertson-Stephens Contrarian is 
Dreyfus Capital Value (Premier), a New York-based portfolio that also does 
short selling, has been heavily into gold stocks and maintains a modest option 
weighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1985, Dreyfus Capital Value (Premier) won some acclaim in 1987, 
when it returned 34.5%, compared to an average rise of just 0.5% for general 
equity funds. However, it trailed the S&P 500 in four of the next six years and 
badly lagged in 1991 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The $445-million portfolio carries a maximum sales charge of 4.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the most intriguing thing about hedge or contrarian mutual funds is that 
there are so few of them. Stephens believes that most fund families see a 
potential conflict with their existing product lines. "Most groups don't want 
to introduce a fund that implies the other funds they're promoting aren't 
attractive," he says. "But a year from now, I think there will be many more 
like it." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Chicago-based Acorn International ((800) 9-ACORN-9) says it will close its 
doors to new investors effective Feb. 11, less than two years after it 
premiered. Existing shareholders will be able to continue adding to their 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Ralph Wanger said the fund's management wants to control growth so 
that its investment focus of buying small foreign stocks isn't impaired. The 
no-load portfolio, which bested most rival international funds in 1993, has 
attracted more than $650 million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
 The sibling Acorn Fund, which invests primarily in small U.S. stocks, has been 
closed since 1990. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Liberty Financial Funds of New York has unveiled a quarterly newsletter 
designed for its shareholders under 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our research has shown that kids have a strong desire to learn more about 
investing," said Kenneth R. Leibler, the company's president. 
</P>
<P>
 The Liberty Financial Advisor for Young Investors will feature articles and 
word games and will include a question-and-answer section. It will also profile 
companies of interest to younger shareholders, such as PepsiCo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Vanguard Group has unveiled three new index funds covering the short, 
intermediate and long ends of the bond market. The no-load portfolios will hold 
government and corporate bonds in three maturity ranges: one to five years, 
five to 10 years and 10 years or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanguard ((800) 662-7447) says the funds will feature some of the lowest costs 
around, with anticipated expense ratios of about 0.18%, or $1.80 for each 
$1,000 investment. A $10 account maintenance fee will be waived for 1994. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Dalbar Research of Boston says it found that the shareholder statements put 
out by mutual fund groups vary widely, with some being easy to use while others 
"require an interpreter." 
</P>
<P>
 In a study, Dalbar evaluated actual account statements at 40 fund groups. The 
company cited four firms for the best presentations -- Putnam Investments of 
Boston, Invesco Funds of Denver, New York-based Dreyfus Corp. and G.T. Global 
in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Traits associated with user-friendly statements included large type size, 
explanations of how to read the statements and summaries that prominently show 
the total value of an investor's holdings.

FIRST PERSON / PAUL DEAN: '6.6 A NEW MEASURE OF PERSONAL TOUGHNESS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you are not among the hundreds bloodied or the thousands bathing at water 
fountains in Woodley Park, this is the moment to exhale, kiss jujus and thank 
whomever is your god. 
</P>
<P>
 We've made it. Cats are limping home. Crickets are peering from cracks. Satan 
shrugged and lost. To redirect Winston Churchill: If Los Angeles and Southern 
California last a thousand years, men will still say: "This was their finest 
hour." 
</P>
<P>
 And if over the age of 50, know that you have survived the Big One. Because, 
by the stringy whiskers of fallible Nostradamus, you won't live long enough to 
see anything worse than these convulsions that left dozens dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Trust me. I've been mortared in Beirut and firebombed in Phoenix. There were 
rubber bullets in Belfast and a nasty assortment of projectiles in Vietnam. But 
all that was instantaneous danger. Done in a blinding instant and dimming by 
the second beer. 
</P>
<P>
 My only experience as vicious as the Northridge earthquake -- the one time 
where peril was incessant with absolutely no place to hide -- was any month 
during a childhood stunted by the London Blitz. Then came buzz bombs. Then 
V-2s. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Los Angeles, wear your survivor T-shirts with pride. Like the mandatory 
eight count, you've made 6.6 a new measurement of personal toughness. You've 
seen Armageddon and journeyed home. You've found fresh priorities during an 
epochal week where the aftershocks had a heftier wallop than most anything we 
had felt before. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's time to flip off the gloom, look back in better humor and continue 
the philosophy written by one Ventura Boulevard merchant on the plywood where 
her store windows used to be: "The Glass Is Still Half Full." 
</P>
<P>
 Our first act after the 18-wheeler rolled through the upstairs bedroom was to 
disengage from twisted sheets, paintings on the pillows, night stands on the 
bed and each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Thoughts and words were shards that rattled and collided in the dark. You OK? 
Seen my slippers? Hear any hissing, smell any burning? Thank God for large Mag 
Lites. 
</P>
<P>
 This certainly was more excitement that any couple deserved with the lights 
out and their jammies on. 
</P>
<P>
 And at 4:31 a.m. on Jan. 17, Los Angeles certainly was no place for any man 
with a passion for collecting antique clocks. And staircase walls no inspired 
choice for displaying her collection of ceramic masks.  
</P>
<P>
 I asked about the dining room. "Ankle deep in a generous contribution to the 
wealth of Lord Waterford," she said. "Our 16 glasses are now a priceless 
1,750-piece collection." 
</P>
<P>
 She asked about the kitchen. "Your worst nightmare." Eggs in an olive oil 
marinade? "Molasses and soy sauce," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cocktail cabinet had exploded. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing so benign as Jack Daniel's to wipe up from hardwood floors. Just a 
wall-to-wall slick of tawny port and Bailey's Irish Cream, a puddle of maroon 
ooze that might have marked Jack the Ripper's last victim. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was no joy in Plasticville. 
</P>
<P>
 Chez Lilian, a fine French restaurant, was on its roof. A trestle bridge had 
collapsed on a vintage car. Residents were prone, supine, eyes staring, feet 
showing from beneath huge rocks, a human litter around the horror of a crashed 
locomotive and crushed boxcars. 
</P>
<P>
 But my Lionel model railroad can be righted and rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey the cat, displaying uncanny feral wisdom, had gone AWOL 12 hours ahead 
of the show. Wednesday night there was a furry thud against the front door. The 
wayward gray had returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Collar and tags were gone. She ate three cans of 9 Lives fisherman stew, drank 
two bowls of water and hasn't purred since. We are withholding salmon until she 
tells us where she has been. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Animals are odd, sad little victims of earthquakes. Flyers are sprouting 
everywhere. Anyone seen Tabiatha? Benny needs medication. A $100 reward for 
Turbo. Several thousand cats must be on the lam, with none in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 I suspect they're alongside Interstate 10 around Covina, paws out and hitching 
rides to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Jake, the very British bulldog belonging to a friend. He has legs 
like fireplugs -- the dog, not the friend. Shoulders broader than the Thames 
Estuary. But when it hit the fan, this tough doggie pooped himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Back to hitchhiking. Tuesday, a homeless person hefting a single tote stood by 
a Ventura Freeway on-ramp. He held a new line in cardboard signs. It said: 
"Oregon." 
</P>
<P>
 Just for an instant, I became achingly aware that I had the wheels and if this 
guy had money for gas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 That same day, the first twitch of normalcy returned to the San Fernando 
Valley. Just before noon, KFWB-AM paused for a breath from uninterrupted, 
shiver-to-shake coverage of the quake -- to give us an update of the Lorena 
Bobbitt trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, with gas but no water, with electricity and two dishes, we also 
nudged closer to routine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have broccoli and bean sprouts, a jar of water chestnuts, two cans of 
chunky chicken, and I see the wok underneath the bookcase," she announced. "We 
will have a stir fry." 
</P>
<P>
 She thought about it some more. No can do. No soy sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Physically, materially, more than a million citizens are months away from 
recovery. Emotionally, none of us will remain unstained by these awful days. 
Too many tents and sobs in the night in public parks. Too many chilled children 
with diarrhea. Too many old, sick and lonely people who will forever gasp 
whenever a truck rumbles by. 
</P>
<P>
 With the roof over our heads in less of a shambles, we must now reach out. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight pounds of oven-baked chicken should go a long way in Balboa Park. Peanut 
butter and jelly for a dozen loaves won't cost much. We have some gallons of 
Sparkletts water, wearable T-shirts in storage, aspirin and much canned food 
for those who right now are trying to reuse disposable diapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomorrow, next year, sometime when other troubles rise, we will lessen them by 
turning to a pewter tankard and an old harmonica. 
</P>
<P>
 The tankard is mine. It came from the MV Stirling Castle, one of the 
courageous little ships that evacuated Dunkirk. The mug survived that, only to 
be squashed oval half a century later in alien Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The harmonica is hers. A gift from long ago. It has made music around a dozen 
campfires and eased many blues when days didn't go right. Monday it was crushed 
into a V. 
</P>
<P>
 So we've put them together as a personal memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 To dark, frightening times when there was little to drink and certainly no 
music.

PEOPLE; YOU ALWAYS HURT THE ONE YOU LOVE

<P>
 Suppose you're betrayed by your beloved, making you the hapless victim in a 
love triangle. At whom are you likely to be angrier -- your philandering mate, 
your rival or yourself? 
</P>
<P>
 Your partner, hands down, says Eugene Mathes, a psychologist at Western 
Illinois University who queried 40 college students and published the findings 
in Psychological Reports. 
</P>
<P>
 In his survey of 20 men and 20 women, students rated themselves on probable 
anger and aggression toward each member of the triangle. While the partner 
received the most anger, the rival "is a real close second," Mathes says. 
</P>
<P>
 His findings confirm several British studies of love-triangle murder cases "in 
which the victim is almost always the straying partner," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is the wayward mate the object of the most venom? 
</P>
<P>
 Mathes suspects it's because he or she has betrayed the partner, but the third 
party has not. The stronger the betrayed love, the more fierce the anger. 
</P>
<P>
 In another survey, respondents told Mathes that they would rather lose a 
relationship to a rival who has a lot going in terms of income, brains, looks 
or a combination than to someone perceived as a loser. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just easier on the self-esteem," he says. KATHLEEN DOHENY

STREET SMART: TEENS, IGNORE RUMORS: LEGAL DRIVING AGE IS STILL SWEET 16 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 We would like to know what's going on with a law that we've heard about that 
supposedly says that if you were born in 1980, you cannot drive until you're 18 
years of age. We have heard many different rumors saying both that the law has 
passed, and that it hasn't passed. 
</P>
<P>
 We want to know the truth. Is this actually a law, or is it only an urban 
myth? 
</P>
<P>
 The Eighth Grade Print Media Class St. Margaret's School San Juan Capistrano 
It's a myth. You can begin driving as early as age 15 1/2 if you meet the 
requirements to obtain a driver's learning permit and drive with someone who is 
18 or older. 
</P>
<P>
 You can get a full-fledged driver's license at age 16 if you pass written and 
road tests, said Department of Motor Vehicles spokesman Bill Madison.  
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 When will Barranca Parkway in Irvine be open from Sand Canyon Avenue to 
Jeffrey Road? 
</P>
<P>
 Donald E. Nordstrom Laguna Hills Construction on the 1.6-mile extension of 
Barranca Parkway will begin in February, 1996, and should be completed by 
October of that year, said Timor Rafiq, principal transportation analyst for 
Irvine. The project is now in the design and funding phases. 
</P>
<P>
 Linking Sand Canyon and Jeffrey was not a priority until recently, when 
development began burgeoning in the area, Rafiq said. The practice in Irvine, 
as in many cities, is not to construct a street until developers begin to build 
in the area.  
</P>
<P>
 When it's done, Barranca's missing link will include two lanes in each 
direction, bicycle lanes, graded shoulders and landscaping, Rafiq said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 At Lambert Road and the Orange Freeway there is a park and ride. Access to it 
is easy if one is coming from the freeway or westbound on Lambert. However, for 
anyone who is trying to enter it coming from the west or south, a U-turn at the 
freeway is the only solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, to get back on the freeway in either direction is an exercise in courage 
and determination. You have to cross three lanes of traffic and then make a 
U-turn. Isn't there a safer way? 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Markson Fullerton Caltrans spokeswoman Rose Orem says when the freeway 
interchange was originally designed, it provided for safe traffic flow to and 
from the freeway, but did not allow for any park-and-ride lots. The lot at 
Lambert Road was added years later by the Orange County Transportation 
Authority, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the park-and-ride lot does have some drawbacks, it is the only 
available site in the area for that purpose, Orem said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the strength of your letter, Caltrans will explore possible improvements. 
Any plans would have to involve the OCTA, the county and the city of Brea, 
where the lot is located, she said. Meanwhile, Caltrans suggests to cross the 
three lanes of traffic safely, you may have to give yourself more time and 
continue to the next intersection before completing the U-turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I'm writing about the feasibility of making a second left-turn lane from 
Camino del Avion onto Del Obispo Street in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 During the school year, the left-turn lane is stacked two blocks at times. The 
option of looping around on Camino del Avion via Alipaz Street back to Del 
Obispo isn't that popular. I don't use it because it is longer and requires a 
longer wait trying to get back onto Del Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 Camino del Avion has three southbound lanes. Why can't the middle lane be an 
optional left/straight lane since there are two lanes available and much fewer 
cars using it to proceed directly ahead? 
</P>
<P>
 Mae T. Nikaido South Laguna San Juan Capistrano's traffic engineer Bud Vokoun 
said your letter is the first time the city has been made aware of this 
situation. City traffic engineers will study the area and if, throughout the 
day, traffic seems to back up consistently, they may consider your suggestion 
to re-stripe the lanes, or implement another plan.  
</P>
<P>
 You are welcome to call Vokoun at (714) 493-1171, Ext. 200, in about two 
months to find out the results of the investigation.

 Directors of the Ventura County Community Foundation recently faced a problem 
that charities normally never consider: With its goal of $5 million in assets 
achieved six months early, what to do next? 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation's success in attracting dollars comes at a time when most other 
Ventura County charities have seen donations choked off by a tight economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so easy to get the money, it's almost embarrassing," said Kate McLean, 
who heads the foundation's tiny staff in a modest suite of offices in 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers say the group, which is entering its seventh year, has managed to 
sock away millions of dollars in endowments because it has a committed, 
energetic board of directors and an experienced staff. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps more importantly, they say, the foundation has filled a gaping 
hole in the county's philanthropic community. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the foundation was created, there was no place where wealthy Ventura 
County residents could set up charitable trust funds in a cost-efficient 
manner. As a result, when people died, they often left assets to organizations 
outside the county, said Beverly Viola, an official of the Ventura County 
chapter of United Way. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the Ventura County Community Foundation, individuals or families can 
establish a permanent fund that generates income from interest and dividends. 
Revenue from the fund is then disbursed annually in the family's name in the 
form of grants to a variety of charitable causes, Viola said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The foundation has the expertise to set up endowments and to administer 
grants from them," Viola said. "They are providing a service that no one else 
does." 
</P>
<P>
 The group started in 1988 with a $50,000 endowment from the Teague family, 
longtime Ventura County farmers and ranchers. Dividends from that endowment 
provide a $2,000 annual scholarship to a student pursuing a degree in 
agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the foundation manages 80 separate endowments worth $5 million. This 
year, it will award $55,000 in grants to youth and family service programs in 
support of a variety of philanthropic interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, for example, poor children received dental care at Clinicas del 
Camino Real in Oxnard under a $1,000 grant provided by the Ag Land Services 
Community Fund. The Boys & Girls Club of Moorpark received $2,000 for a 
homework tutoring program, and the Ojai Shakespeare Festival received $3,250 
that it used to encourage teen-agers to attend performances. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of fund-raisers associated with United Way decided in 1987 that 
Ventura County needed a community foundation, McLean said. Such umbrella trusts 
to benefit community needs have been around for nearly a century, and they are 
the fastest-growing area of philanthropy in the United States, a spokesman for 
the Council of Foundations in Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 400 community foundations in the nation today, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who eventually made up the Ventura County Community Foundation's 
first board of directors were attracted by the ease and flexibility of 
establishing funds, McLean said. But a twinge of envy also helped get it off 
the ground, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighboring Santa Barbara County has had a community foundation since 1928 and 
boasted $40 million in permanent endowments, McLean said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think our community leaders liked to hear that Santa Barbara County 
had $40 million in its community foundation and this county had nothing," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Ventura County foundation was launched, with the board of directors 
holding its first meeting in February, 1988. From the start, the foundation was 
able to lure some of the county's most powerful and wealthy residents to its 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancher Alan M. Teague is one of the founding directors and currently serves 
as president. Other directors include rancher-developer Tom R. Leonard, lawyer 
Laura McAvoy and citrus rancher John V. Newman. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its stellar board, however, the foundation struggled to attract money 
in its first three years. At the end of 1990, it had just $420,400 in permanent 
endowments. 
</P>
<P>
 That changed dramatically over the next three years. By 1991, assets had more 
than tripled; 1992 and 1993 also saw explosive growth, with the foundation 
reaching its goal of $5 million in permanent endowments six months ahead of its 
June, 1994, deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 McLean attributes the success to the group's increased visibility. As people 
began to learn about the foundation and what it could do, more donated money, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money has always been here," she said. "People were just waiting for a 
vehicle that they could trust and that could invest and manage their funds 
wisely." 
</P>
<P>
 Others say much of the credit goes to McLean herself. The fund's rapid growth 
began shortly after she was hired to run things at the end of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation recruited McLean away from Interface Children, Family Services 
of Ventura County, a social services agency she helped found 20 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kate is a dynamo," Viola said. "She built (Interface) from a tiny 
organization into a multimillion-dollar group with nearly 50 employees." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first things McLean did was to urge each board member to establish 
a fund in the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had not done that," McLean said. "I told them that until they were 
visibly committed to the permanence of the foundation, it was going to be 
difficult to convince others to be committed." 
</P>
<P>
 McLean also persuaded trustees of other private funds and foundations in 
Ventura County to transfer their money to the Ventura County Community 
Foundation, where it could be more efficiently managed. And she made sure that 
estate planners knew about the foundation and would recommend it to interested 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
 But no foundation can prosper without the leadership and visibility of a 
strong board, McLean said. The foundation's directors are movers and shakers 
representing every corner of the county, she said. And each one is committed to 
the idea of building a lasting establishment, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teague agrees that directors are in it for the long haul. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are making up for lost time," he said. "The core is there, and the spirit 
is there." 
</P>
<P>
 Current directors include cardiologist Dr. William L. Hart, banker Marshall C. 
Milligan and Otis Chandler, former chairman of the board of Times Mirror Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have people who are seen as credible, honest, committed and visionary 
people," McLean said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaching the $5-million mark has bestowed the Ventura County Community 
Foundation with legitimacy among its peers, said Charles Slosser, executive 
director of the Santa Barbara County Community Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of an unwritten rule that once a foundation reaches $5 million, it 
has the stability and assets to keep growing indefinitely," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's foundation is "strong, growing, young and energetic," Slosser 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since reaching that $5-million target, McLean says, the foundation's directors 
have set an ambitious new goal: They want to have $40 million in permanent 
endowments by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on a roll," she said. "I see no reason for it to stop now."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; CHURCHES OFFER WORDS OF COMFORT; RELIGION: IN 
SIMI VALLEY AND FILLMORE, MINISTERS URGE CONGREGATIONS TO COPE WITH THE QUAKE 
AFTERMATH BY RELYING ON THEIR FAITH AND BY HELPING THEIR NEIGHBORS.

<P>
 The alabaster likeness of Mother Mary still lies toppled and cracked outside 
the shaken house of worship that is St. Peter Claver Church in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But inside the chapel Sunday morning, Father Dennis Mongrain used last week's 
deadly earthquake -- and the stories of heroes and humanity that have since 
been told -- as the cornerstone of a sermon that preached encouragement and 
concern for others. 
</P>
<P>
 "God writes with great and crooked lines," Mongrain told members of his 
congregation. "God reminds us of the preciousness of people and how quickly our 
lives can change." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of parishioners listened Sunday as ministers in Simi Valley and 
Fillmore urged their congregations to keep their faith and to help each other 
rebound from the series of temblors. 
</P>
<P>
 Church services in the two hardest-hit cities in Ventura County were dominated 
by inspirational messages delivered to victims of the earthquake and their 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Some said the pews were a little fuller at St. Peter Claver on Sunday than in 
previous weeks. Others said it was the earthquake that brought people to church 
who might never have come. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can pray at home and read your Bible at home, but when you come to 
church, it's like a whole family coming together," said Beverly Avery, a Simi 
Valley woman whose home suffered structural damage in the Jan. 17 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sermon helped me to relieve the tension I feel deep down inside, and it 
will help me face the rest of this week," she said. "We have all suffered the 
same shock." 
</P>
<P>
 Janice Schaeffer said she was so frightened by the quake that she plans to 
move from Simi Valley to Arizona as soon as possible. Schaeffer said that when 
the earthquake struck, her immediate concern was for her young children: 
Taylor, 7; Sara, 6, and Sally, 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been through the rollers. I've been through lots of these," she said 
outside St. Peter Claver. "But it's never before jeopardized my children's 
health or safety. I'm actually thankful I have three screaming kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The church suffered moderate damage in the earthquake and aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceiling in the back of the building, where religion classes are held 
during the week, was badly cracked but inspectors have already ruled the 
facility safe, Mongrain said. The classes are canceled through Wednesday while 
repairs are under way, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the structural damage caused by the quake, Mongrain sees stress and 
worry in the eyes of his worshipers. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I also see a willingness to reach out and help," he said between Masses. 
"Even people who have lost their own homes have asked me what they could do to 
help." 
</P>
<P>
 In Fillmore, 191 members of Fillmore Bible Church abandoned their red-tagged 
65-year-old sanctuary and held an afternoon service at undamaged Faith 
Community Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The bell tower of Fillmore Bible Church sustained severe structural damage, 
orphaning the 300-member congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who would have thought Fillmore Bible Church would meet anywhere other than 
1st and Central?" Pastor Dave Fenska asked church members in his opening 
remarks Sunday. "This week has proved that the church is not a building . . . 
the church is people." 
</P>
<P>
 Fenska said the church, which was built in 1929, will be closed for at least 
two months while the damage is assessed. The congregation will meet at Faith 
Community Church this Sunday, too. 
</P>
<P>
 It will cost an estimated $1,500 to inspect the structure, he said. The church 
has no earthquake insurance, and elders are still trying to determine how to 
pay for the inspection and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 During Sunday's service, Fenska invited members of the congregation to the 
podium to share their earthquake experiences and to thank friends and neighbors 
who helped in the quake's aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore resident Kathy Campbell held back tears while assuring the 
congregation that she and her family would recover from the loss of their 
century-old home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here this morning, and I didn't know if I could do this," she said in 
a shaky voice. "I know that by the grace of God, we will get through." 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, whose husband, Roger, is a member of the Fillmore City Council, 
quoted her 18-year-old daughter, Laurie, as saying: "We're not homeless; we're 
houseless." 
</P>
<P>
 Tears and laughter filled the church as friends and neighbors shared their 
sometimes horrific and often humorous stories of the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thankful we have a God we can call on any time -- I sure called on him at 
4:30 in the morning," said 78-year-old Ruth Miller, whose home now displays a 
yellow tag that means that she can enter at her own risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller spent Sunday morning at the Federal Emergency Management Agency center 
in Fillmore, applying for federal aid, before going to church. 
</P>
<P>
 But others found something positive in the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "This quake made me feel like a kid again," said Auston Burson, 47, of 
Fillmore. "I haven't been rocking and rolling at 4 o'clock in the morning in a 
long time." 
</P>

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; RAIN THREAT BRINGS NEW FEARS AS AREA RECOVERS 
FROM QUAKE; WEATHER: SUNDAY'S STORM WAS MILD, BUT THE PREDICTED HALF AN INCH 
FOR TODAY COULD HAMPER CLEANUP EFFORTS AND WORSEN CONDITIONS FOR DISPLACED 
RESIDENTS.

 A mild storm early Sunday dropped only a fraction of an inch of rain on much 
of the county and spared the areas hit hardest by last week's earthquake, 
leaving refugees who camped in tents and cars in Fillmore and Simi Valley dry 
at least for the present. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Ortiz, 62, and her family were among those camping after the 
earthquake damaged their Fillmore home. They were allowed back into their house 
Saturday night, but other family members were still sleeping in a trailer over 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really a miracle," Ortiz said. "I prayed to God that he wouldn't send 
us any rain. We don't need that right now." 
</P>
<P>
 But weather forecasters said a stronger front carrying more rain and cooler 
temperatures was on its way from the Gulf of Alaska. The National Weather 
Service predicted up to half an inch of rain across the county by mid-day 
today, with temperatures dipping into the low 40s at night and low 60s during 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain could hamper efforts to clean up an oil spill in the Santa Clara 
River east of Piru if the runoff pushes the slick beyond a 12- to 15-mile area 
where the oil is contained, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleanup crews were expected to work through the weekend to vacuum up the 
crude, which poured from a pipeline ruptured in Valencia during the Jan. 17 
earthquake. The cleanup effort is expected to continue for weeks, even without 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy rain could also cause more buildings to collapse in the severely damaged 
downtown district in Fillmore as collecting water adds weight to already 
unstable rooftops, said John Foy, a Ventura County Fire Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still in the emergency mode because of the threat of rain," he said. 
"We're worried about things like basements filling up with water. In general, 
the rain is just going to make a mess." 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, P. J. Scholer came to the Red Cross shelter at the Royal High 
School gymnasium for lunch. She said she hoped that the storm forecast for 
today would again skip over the city because she is sleeping in her car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lived in the new three-story senior apartment building," Scholer said. "But 
I'm afraid to go back in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Scholer said she would survive if it rains. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least I have a car to sleep in. Some people don't even have that," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Disaster center manager Beatrice Hutson said 115 people stayed at the gym 
shelter Saturday night. The gymnasium Sunday was a sea of beds and blue 
blankets, with children's toys, boxes of clothes and other belongings scattered 
around. A cat in one of the dozen pet kennels near the entrance yowled to get 
out of its cage. 
</P>
<P>
 People are concerned about the possibility of rain, Hutson said. But they have 
a warm, dry place at the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a television set up for them," she said. "And the kids are happy 
now," she said, pointing outside to an inflatable room with a large purple 
dinosaur on top where children were allowed to bounce around. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Hightower of Simi Valley said he brought the "Din-O-Rama" to the high 
school to cheer up the children. Shelter officials and a county mental health 
employee said Hightower's idea was working. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it!" said Carmen Acosta, 7, of Simi Valley. "It's bouncy." 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles away at the Federal Emergency Management Agency center at the 
Sycamore Drive Community Center in Simi Valley, quake victims waited to talk 
with workers as officials vowed to keep the emergency office open as long as 
they are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Two dozen more FEMA interviewers arrived at the center Sunday, bringing to 80 
the number of workers on hand to help victims of the 6.6 temblor sort through 
the loan and grant application process. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers on Sunday were guiding victims to various agencies, sending some to 
the Small Business Administration, Veterans Administration, or state and 
federal tax offices. The Veterans Administration was offering $200 vouchers to 
those meeting its eligibility guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom DeRose of Simi Valley, whose home remodeling firm sustained major damage 
in the earthquake, waited at the FEMA office with his wife, Sherri, for a 
chance to apply for a SBA loan. DeRose said he lost cabinets and other 
inventory valued at more than $300,000 when the ceiling of his Northridge shop 
collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't get some type of funding, we'll be out of business," he said. 
"Someone told us it was going to be a couple of weeks before we get any help." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the auditorium, hundreds more victims waited in line merely to 
schedule appointments with caseworkers. By midmorning, workers were handing out 
appointments for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohammed Rafiq said 23 people were living in his Simi Valley house because the 
homes of his relatives had been damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wall fell off and everything inside is broken," he said of one of his 
relatives' houses. "It's a disaster. We are six, seven families living in one 
house." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, at the front of the line, Rafiq was told to come back today to begin 
filling out low-interest loan applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they had served more than 3,100 people at the Simi Valley FEMA 
center since the earthquake. But spokesman Robert Mullins said it would be 
eight or nine days until anyone applying for help Sunday receives grant or loan 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Mullins said applicants could receive up to $2,800 in grants and as much as 
$20,000 in loans after inspectors process applications. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not an instantaneous process," he said. "And there is a backlog." 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Abuzaid, 35, a U. S. Postal Service worker in Moorpark, had gathered his 
loan applications and was collecting his family. His mother, father and several 
other relatives were staying with him and his young son when the earthquake 
hit. Now they are living between a family van and a car. 
</P>
<P>
 "Except me," Abuzaid said. "I slept in the house, even though it was damaged." 
</P>
<P>
 He was grateful that the rain had spared the city, but was nervous about 
forecasts for today. "My roof is open where the tiles fell off," he said. "You 
can see the light through it." 
</P>
<P>
 In Fillmore, about 325 people were expected to have completed disaster 
assistance applications by Sunday. Workers there were handing out appointments 
through Thursday, but they were also able to help some people as they arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Fritschle, Fillmore disaster application coordinator for FEMA, said 
people were able to complete applications in two hours, a dramatic difference 
from the four, five or even 11-hour waits some victims experienced elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth residents Bob Medof and Zacary Batsalkin said they waited in line 
for five hours at a Northridge FEMA center Thursday and were told that they 
would have to wait another three hours at the Simi Valley center when they 
drove there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were ready to riot in Northridge," he said. They drove to Fillmore on 
Friday and found no waiting and returned Sunday to complete their business. 
</P>
<P>
 Red Cross officials there said 55 to 60 residents a night have slept at a 
shelter at the Memorial Building since the quake, and another 100 people have 
registered but not yet come to the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 130 people slept at the Fillmore Middle School gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat of rain could bring more residents to the shelters in coming days, 
said Sandro Monteverde, 22, a Red Cross site manager at the Memorial Building 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people find their roofs leaking or other problems occur, they could end up 
here," he said.

Bosch, and correspondent Jeff McDonald. How to Help

STREET SMART: POST-QUAKE ROAD PROBLEMS CENTERED IN FILLMORE, SIMI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Readers: 
</P>
<P>
 For the past week, it seems that most residents have been too busy dealing 
with post-quake problems to worry about mistimed traffic signals and faded lane 
striping. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Street Smart mailbag is not exactly overflowing with its usual array 
of clever missives, we offer a quick guide to some of the quake-related 
closures and changes in Simi Valley and Fillmore, the Ventura County cities 
most affected by the earthquake. In Fillmore: 
</P>
<P>
 There are no major road ruptures around the city, now that a huge chasm caused 
when a gas storage tank under California 126 exploded has been neatly filled in 
and covered. 
</P>
<P>
 However, several intersections and streets are closed indefinitely because of 
severely damaged buildings. They are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Central Avenue from Main to 1st streets. 
</P>
<P>
 * The intersection of Main and Saratoga Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 * The intersection of Fillmore Avenue and Santa Clara Street to Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
 * All the alleys between Central Avenue and Mountain View Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore Public Works Director John Kozar said he would not be able to reopen 
the streets until all the buildings in the area were inspected and rated for 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief closure on Jan. 17, the stretch of California 23 linking 
Fillmore and Moorpark is open, but looking somewhat unfriendly. During each 
aftershock that rolls through the area, piles of sand and dirt collect at the 
edges of the roadway, growing as debris slides down the hillsides. In Simi 
Valley: 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the quake-enhanced bumps and blips along Los Angeles Avenue and 
Cochran Street, roads are operating smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, however, minor inconveniences on some streets:

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CLASSES OFFERED ON QUAKE PREPAREDNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The county chapter of American Red Cross has expanded its schedule of 
earthquake- and disaster-preparedness classes in response to heightened public 
interest after last week's temblors. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-hour classes, which cost $5, outline home-safety tips, first-aid 
basics and information about buying and assembling earthquake kits. 
</P>
<P>
 Lectures and videos are used for the class instruction, and participants will 
receive brochures and a 32-page planning guide. 
</P>
<P>
 The first classes were held this weekend and more are scheduled in Santa Ana 
at 600 N. Park Center Drive, Room 217, on these dates: 
</P>
<P>
 * Feb. 13, at 10 a.m. Class is in English. 
</P>
<P>
 * March 10, 7 p.m. Class is in English. 
</P>
<P>
 * March 12, 2 p.m. Class is in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Instructors will offer a variety of safety tips and information on topics such 
as storing water, food, first-aid kits, shovels and ladders in accessible 
places, and placing smoke detectors in the most effective spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristen Haydon, assistant director of health and safety services for the local 
Red Cross, said the checklist given to participants can help families scan 
their homes for trouble spots. 
</P>
<P>
 The classes focus on earthquakes but also offer information about fire and 
flood risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We give people an idea of the hazards that they might confront, which helps 
them react better during an emergency," Haydon said. "A lot of times, people 
just panic and don't know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 For more information about class schedules or to register, call (714) 
835-5381, Ext. 231. 
</P>
<P>
 For information on earthquakes, write to the local Red Cross, P.O. Box 11364, 
Santa Ana, Calif. 92711. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross also offers a disaster welfare inquiry service to people who 
have been unable to reach relatives or friends in the areas hardest hit by the 
Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The service, which will be offered as long as necessary, is available daily 
from 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. at (714) 835-5381.GEOFF BOUCHER

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; HIGHER TIERRA REJADA SPEED LIMIT OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Moorpark City Council has decided to raise the speed limit on Tierra 
Rejada Road from 40 m.p.h. to 45 m.p.h. between Spring Road and the Moorpark 
Freeway, given recent improvements and expansion of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 0 last week to increase the speed on the road, which 
was recently converted from an aging, two-lane stretch to a newly paved, 
four-lane divided highway. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the new and improved road service and an expanded number of lanes, 
people can safely travel faster on that road," Councilman Scott Montgomery 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned by the road's former condition, council members voted about two 
years ago to reduce the speed from 45 m.p.h. to 40 m.p.h. JAMES MAIELLA JR.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; CITY PLANS TO BUY LOT FOR LOW-COST HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JAMES MAIELLA JR.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Moorpark will attempt to buy about 1.3 acres of land downtown now 
in tax default with Ventura County and use the property for affordable housing, 
City Council members said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council last week voted 4 to 0 to pursue the purchase of the land for 
about $32,000.Councilman Pat Hunter was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the city can buy the property, located near the Le Club apartment 
complex, it must clear a series of county bureaucratic hurdles, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an opportunity that comes along to buy a piece of property at a very low 
price, which plays right into one of our priorities, in that we can potentially 
develop some affordable housing in the area," Mayor Paul Lawrason said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrason said the land is zoned to allow 15 housing units per acre, so the 
city potentially could build up to 20 units of affordable housing by taking 
advantage of affordable-housing development incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Scott Montgomery also supported the acquisition and said that even 
if the city is not able to develop the land, it probably stands to benefit from 
the transaction. "It's available at such a bargain price," Montgomery said. "If 
we are subsequently unable to do anything with it, we could easily get our 
money out of it." JAMES MAIELLA JR.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; 250 INDULGE SWEET TOOTH TO AID YOUTH CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Abby Johnson's mission in life Sunday was clear. 
</P>
<P>
 For three hours in the afternoon, the 8-year-old Camarillo girl made it her 
goal to sample each of the dozens of chocolate cakes, ice creams, confections 
and other sugar-coma-inducing treats offered during the Camarillo Boys & Girls 
Club Chocolate Sunday event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've tried nearly everything, but so far I'd have to say that I like the 
chocolate-covered bananas the best," Abby said. "But the white chocolate isn't 
bad either." 
</P>
<P>
 Abby, her pal Melissa Sopoliga, 9, and about 250 other chocolate lovers of all 
ages attended the event in the gymnasium of the Boys & Girls Club on Temple 
Avenue in what organizers described as combination community outreach and 
fund-raising event. 
</P>
<P>
 As participants munched in the balloon-bedecked gym, they were entertained by 
a Dixieland band and magicians. But only a face-painting artist could distract 
the kids from their gooey targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the second annual event were pleased with how many people 
participated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering the earthquakes and the playoff games, I'd say we have a pretty 
good turnout," said Jay Grigsby, the club's executive director. "This year, we 
have definitely had some obstacles thrown our way." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, club officials said the event would net about $5,000 for the club. That 
money will provide programs and services for Camarillo-area youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Participating in the feast were an estimated 25 service clubs, bakeries, 
restaurants and businesses, said Laurie Carie, a member of the club's parents 
auxiliary. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a chance for folks to come out and see the facility and learn about 
the various programs the club offers," Carie said. "When people find out that a 
year's membership for their child is just $12, they can't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Joining in the fun were a few people who, despite great temptation, didn't get 
swept away by the chocolate tide. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo pediatric dentist Mark Lisagor and his staff handed out about 300 
toothbrushes during the event -- along with chocolate-dipped bananas. 
</P>
<P>
 "There actually is some research indicating that chocolate . . . may not be as 
bad as we once thought in terms of promoting tooth decay," said Lisagor, a 
principal of the Camarillo Childrens Dental Group. "But we're here to support 
the club and have some fun. If I have any message, it would be to promote 
general dental hygiene. Hence the toothbrushes." J. E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; COUNCIL MAY AMEND PLANNING PROCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council on Tuesday will consider proposals to streamline the 
city's planning process and give the council more control over land-use issues. 
</P>
<P>
 One ordinance would create the new position of city zoning administrator, who 
would have the authority to issue minor permits that now must be approved by 
either the Planning Commission or City Council.That official, who would also be 
the city's community development director, would decide requests for zoning 
variances, but such decisions could be appealed to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 A second proposal would refer all significant projects proposed in Oxnard to 
the council before a formal application is accepted. The pre-application 
screening would enable individual council members to comment on the projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The pre-application screening would increase council control over land-use 
planning, said William Fulton of Ventura, who publishes the California Planning 
and Development Report. 
</P>
<P>
 Fulton said the change would diminish the role of the Planning Commission to 
more of a technical review body. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Flores, who resigned from the Oxnard Planning Commission when the council 
reduced its membership and called for direct appointments by individual council 
members, criticized the proposal. "What's the point in having a Planning 
Commission if (the council) gets a shot at a project before it goes to the 
commission and then has the final say?" Flores asked. PATRICK McCARTNEY

QUAKE MAY END BATTLE OVER FILLMORE HOTEL; AFTERMATH: HISTORIC HOME TO 
LOW-INCOME LABORERS WAS SEVERELY DAMAGED. OWNER MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REBUILD, 
PLEASING REDEVELOPMENT FORCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the walls of the Fillmore Hotel peeled away and crumbled to the sidewalk, 
a long-running dispute between the owner of the historic building and city 
officials may have been jolted to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 As a pre-dawn earthquake gripped the two-story brick apartment house Jan. 17, 
dozens of farm workers fled the crumbling structure, abandoning everything they 
owned. The walls of the building collapsed, crushing a row of cars on the 
street below and fully exposing the one- and two-bedroom apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The walls were falling down all around me," hotel resident Francisco Perez 
said. "We were waiting for the ceiling to fall in on top of us. We were waiting 
to die." 
</P>
<P>
 The damage left more than 50 people homeless and confirmed the fears of city 
officials who had shut down the aging apartment house in 1987 after concluding 
that an earthquake had turned hairline fractures into inch-wide cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 "My gut feeling is that that building was never safe," said Fillmore Fire 
Chief Pat Askren, noting that the building is now so severely damaged that it 
could be condemned. "We're just lucky that no one was killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Marsh, who won a legal battle to reopen the 17-unit hotel he bought in 
1986, said he intends to take a hard look at whether to try to rebuild the 
turn-of-the-century building, a longtime home to fieldworkers and other 
laborers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of bigotry here," Marsh said. "If I were to try to rebuild, I 
would meet so much resistance that it would probably not be worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 If Marsh can't rebuild, he concedes that it would mean the end of a 
hard-fought battle to keep the hotel open. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a building that they have wanted closed for a long time," said Marsh, 
who maintains that the 1987 earthquake was used as an excuse to try to rid the 
downtown area of the hotel and its low-income tenants. "Ultimately, they may 
have succeeded." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fillmore Hotel has been trapped in the city's struggle to boost its 
financial future by re-creating its past. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have embarked on an ambitious redevelopment campaign aimed at 
rejuvenating the local economy by revitalizing the historic downtown business 
district. In recent years, the city has poured hundreds of thousands of dollars 
into refurbishing the turn-of-the-century buildings that make up Fillmore's 
business core. 
</P>
<P>
 Just days before the earthquake, the city was scheduled to push forward with 
the redevelopment effort along Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hotel had not been included in those plans, city officials say, even 
though it is on Main Street and was built in the early 1900s. Marsh said he 
believes that the hotel was excluded partly because of its stormy relationship 
with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also contends that officials don't want the hotel or its tenants in the 
downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders and residents privately admit that the hotel's demise would 
benefit the Main Street improvement project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was considered unsafe years ago and it hasn't been fixed," said Dorothy 
Haase, executive director of the Fillmore Historical Museum and a member of a 
task force set up to guide downtown redevelopment efforts. "They should have 
never allowed the people to move back then." 
</P>
<P>
 In October, 1987, city inspectors condemned the hotel a few days after a 
powerful earthquake, centered in Whittier, badly rattled the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine days later, officials served the mostly Spanish-speaking residents with 
bilingual evacuation notices and directed them to a Red Cross shelter. A few 
weeks later, Marsh filed a lawsuit charging that the evacuation discriminated 
against the 100 mostly Latino residents who live there. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1988, a Fillmore appeals board ruled that the building was not a 
hazard and that city officials erred when they ordered the evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, made up of building inspectors from neighboring cities, ruled that 
the apartments could be occupied if a sagging floor was bolstered, smoke 
detectors were installed and gas shut-off valves were placed on all appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsh said he has spent nearly $100,000 on improvements, including a 
substantial amount on trying to earthquake-proof the masonry as much as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't fall down. Those walls fell out, which is what they are designed to 
do," Marsh said. "I'm really pleased with the performance of that building." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are others who are less than pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 "We reached a settlement, and it was supposed to be fixed so something like 
this wouldn't happen," Councilman Mike McMahan said. "It's a wonder no one was 
killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly lost in the debate are the laborers and their families left homeless 
when the earthquake hit. City officials say they are working as quickly as 
possible to find housing for them. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the residents have not been allowed to return to the 
building. The hotel has been red-tagged, meaning that the building is unsafe 
and that re-entry may never be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything we have is still in the apartment," said Alvaro Reyes, who like 
many of the other hotel residents is staying at one of the emergency shelters 
set up in the city. "What are we going to do now?"

 Beset by financial shortfalls and dwindling enrollment, Ventura County 
Community College District leaders are debating whether to recruit more foreign 
students who pay hefty tuition and other surcharges. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign students provide a cash windfall for the college district because 
their education is not subsidized by taxpayers and they pay a minimum of $3,120 
in tuition and fees a year. Even with recent fee hikes, a full-time student 
from California pays $312 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Moorpark, Oxnard and Ventura colleges, with a total enrollment of 
26,588, collectively enrolled 239 foreign students without a 
district-coordinated recruitment effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The five trustees of the college district have widely varying views on how 
foreign student recruitment should be handled. 
</P>
<P>
 At one end of the spectrum, Gregory P. Cole would rather the district ignore 
the whole issue and concentrate on the instruction of American students. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something inherently wrong with trying to attract foreign nationals," 
said Cole, who has also announced plans to run for the Thousand Oaks City 
Council. "We have enough problems trying to educate our own American students." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other end, Pete Tafoya argues that board members should decrease the 
surcharges on foreign students to make Ventura County colleges more attractive. 
Tafoya also recently requested a district study on the possible benefits of 
recruiting more foreign students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm asking for a change in paradigm, to use these students as a revenue 
source," he said. "We can take a more positive role in this, or we can continue 
to treat them like someone we don't want." 
</P>
<P>
 College board President Allan Jacobs said that after considering the matter, 
he has come to agree with Tafoya's position. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees Karen Boone and Timothy Hirschberg concur that recruiting foreign 
students may be a good idea for the cash-strapped district, but they see no 
reason to lower their fees, or even to refrain from raising them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want our local taxpayers to subsidize the education of foreign 
students," Hirschberg said. "With the squeeze hitting our public institutions 
today, we need to be responsible to our local taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, foreign students paid $110 per unit, the $13 per unit charged by 
the state on all students, plus a newly added foreign student surcharge of $5 
per unit. Earlier this month, district trustees voted 3 to 2 to increase that 
surcharge by $2 per unit, with the added money going toward a district 
construction fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Tafoya and Jacobs voted against the $2 surcharge. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, some foreign students are bitter about the escalating fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to the States because I was just curious of seeing the land of milk 
and honey," said Opiyo Odhiambo, 27, an Oxnard College student from Nairobi, 
Kenya. "But here they are milking the bits of money I have by raising the fees 
every semester." 
</P>
<P>
 Odhiambo, who is living with family friends near the college, said he is just 
scraping by with a 7 1/2-hour-per-week, $5-per-hour job at the campus library, 
and can barely afford the surcharges levied by the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Some college staff who work directly with foreign students are also irritated 
by the board's penchant for increasing foreign students' fees while 
simultaneously making little effort to accommodate them. 
</P>
<P>
 These staff members say that whatever push for change that exists at the 
district level is in part the result of their own constant harping on the needs 
and struggles of the colleges' foreign populations. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing that seems really wrong with this system is we make these foreign 
students jump through hoops," said Judy Arnold, an adviser to Moorpark 
College's foreign students for about five years. "We need to encourage them, to 
broaden their program, but we don't need to constantly increase their fees." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign student advisers say such students not only get an education at local 
colleges, but also immeasurably add to the education of their American 
classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find they really enrich campus life and help our students learn about other 
cultures," said Pat Preston, the foreign student administrative officer at 
Santa Monica College. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of a student body of 26,000, Santa Monica College has 2,300 foreign 
students, Preston said. The students bring about $8.5 million to the college 
every year that helps fund extra classes and myriad programs the cash-strapped 
college could otherwise not afford, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, college officials fly all over the world recruiting foreign 
students, attending English language schools and study abroad fairs, pitching 
the attractions of their California campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Tafoya and college staff hold up Santa Monica as a college that has benefited 
from foreign student recruitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Santa Monica Community College District uses foreign students as a 
revenue source," Tafoya said. "Right now, we're not marketing for foreign 
students. Every time you increase fees, no matter how much, you lose students." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all foreign students, however, balk at higher fees. Kinuko Osada, for 
instance, finds the United States in general -- and Oxnard College in specific 
-- a bargain, compared to her native Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Osada, 31, moved in with her aunt in Oxnard in December and registered at 
Oxnard College this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I need to study English," she said. "If I go to university in 
Japan, it's more expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 A civil servant at her local city hall since high school graduation, Osada 
decided this year to make a change. She has visited the United States before, 
but this time, she quit her job, gathered up her belongings and money, and 
moved halfway around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family -- well, they don't like it, but they can't stop me," she 
explained. "It is unusual in my part of the country -- I come from a rural area 
-- for women to do something like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Osada said she hopes to continue on to a four-year university after receiving 
her associate's degree from Oxnard College. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Moorpark College's Arnold said, foreign students are often among the 
best at the college, with 80% of Moorpark's foreign students continuing on to a 
four-year institution upon graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They usually do very, very well scholastically," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark College's foreign students often tutor American students and are even 
occasionally called on to lecture a class about a subject that relates to their 
home country, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the classrooms, foreign students can add to political discussions," she 
said. "They bring reality into the classrooms."

NFL PLAYOFFS / XXVIII LOOKS JUST LIKE XXVII; BILLS HOPING FOURTH TIME IS THE 
CHARM; AFC: THOMAS RUNS WILD AS BUFFALO KNOCKS OUT MONTANA AND ROLLS TO 30-13 
VICTORY, SETTING UP REMATCH WITH COWBOYS.

<P>
 As the final minutes ticked away in Sunday's AFC title game at Rich Stadium, 
Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly leaned into a sideline camera, beamed and 
declared, "We're back." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't touch that dial, America. Your worst nightmare is about unfold in living 
color. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills are back in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Back where nobody outside of Buffalo seems to want them. 
</P>
<P>
 Back for the rematch with the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 Back facing abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Back seeking redemption. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo, loser of three consecutive Super Bowls, qualified for an 
unprecedented fourth in a row by beating the Kansas City Chiefs Sunday, 30-13, 
behind the running of Thurman Thomas to win the AFC championship before a 
sellout crowd of 76,642. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief quarterback Joe Montana's dream of getting into a fifth Super Bowl ended 
in disappointment and confusion. Montana finished the game on the sidelines, 
his head whirling from a concussion he received early in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other sideline, Kelly was reveling in the fact that he had disappointed 
so many people who wanted a new AFC representative in Super Bowl XXVIII. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the people who counted us out and didn't want us here," Kelly said, "I'm 
sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 But when it comes to the AFC, the Bills have nothing to apologize for. 
Sunday's victory was Buffalo's fourth in a row in the conference championship 
game, ninth in a row in the AFC playoffs and eighth in a row in Rich Stadium, 
where Buffalo has never lost an AFC playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills weren't about to lose Sunday's game. Not when they saw the Chiefs in 
a defensive scheme that featured six defensive backs, one linebacker and four 
down linemen. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas was salivating at the thought of the havoc he could wreak in the Kansas 
City backfield against that alignment. 
</P>
<P>
 So was Kelly, who couldn't wait to call Thomas' number -- and did, over and 
over and over again. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was 33 carries for 186 yards for Thomas, a club playoff record, and 
three touchdowns in what Thomas called "probably the best game of my six-year 
career." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas scored on runs of 12 and three yards in the first half, blowing by a 
Kansas City blitz on both occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first touchdown, Thomas filled a hole left by an onrushing Martin 
Bayless, avoided a one-handed swipe by Charles Mincy at the five-yard line and 
trotted into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 On his second touchdown, Thomas could have walked in. 
</P>
<P>
 As a matter of fact, he practically did. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Kansas City three-yard line, Thomas was supposed to head up the 
middle. Instead, he found an all-out blitz going directly over center Kent 
Hull. 
</P>
<P>
 So Thomas veered right and found no Chief within reach and barely any within 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you've got 300-pound linemen beating on defensive backs," Thomas said, 
"you're going to put a little wear and tear on a guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just pumped up. Everything was going for eight, nine, 10 yards every 
time I touched the ball and that adrenaline I knew was going to stay with me 
for a long, long time." 
</P>
<P>
 The only one able to keep the Chiefs in the game in the first half was kicker 
Nick Lowery, whose two 31-yard field goals left Kansas City only a point 
behind, 7-6, after one quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 After Thomas' second touchdown, Steve Christie added field goals of 23 and 25 
yards to extend the Bills' lead to 20-6 with two minutes remaining in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Montana made his presence felt, the Joe Montana, the Montana who 
has won four Super Bowls, the Montana who invigorated the Chiefs this season, 
the Montana who has brought his teams back in the fourth quarter 29 times in 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting at his 20, Montana drove the Chiefs to the Bills' five-yard line. A 
touchdown would send Kansas City to the locker room trailing by only seven 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana had that touchdown in his sights when he tossed a pass over the middle 
to a wide-open Kimble Anders. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ball sailed out of Anders' hands into the waiting arms of Buffalo 
defensive back Henry Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 He was knocked out of the game on the third play of the second half, his head 
hitting the hard turf when he was sandwiched between defenders Bruce Smith, 
Jeff Wright and Phil Hansen.  
</P>
<P>
 Montana left having completed only nine of 23 passes for 125 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 On came veteran Dave Krieg, who proved more effective than Montana at moving 
the club. Krieg drove the Chiefs to their only touchdown of the game, Marcus 
Allen going over from a yard out in the third quarter. Allen finished with 50 
yards rushing in 18 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 His touchdown made it 20-13. Suddenly, Kansas City was only seven points back. 
And suddenly that fast-moving Buffalo running game was reduced to a crawl. 
Switching back to their base defense in the second half, the Chiefs closed up 
those big holes the Buffalo offensive line had been opening. 
</P>
<P>
 But only temporarily. The Bills, who would wind up with 229 yards rushing and 
389 yards in total offense, put together two fourth-quarter drives to put the 
game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 The first ended with an 18-yard Christie field goal, the second with another 
three-yard scoring run by Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, the Buffalo defense closed the lid on Kansas City's bid to return 
to the Super Bowl for the first time since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 James Williams intercepted a Krieg pass in the fourth quarter to kill one 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
 On the final play of the game, with the Chiefs at the Bills' three-yard line, 
Krieg hit Todd McNair with a pass that appeared to be good enough for the 
touchdown that would at least make the final score respectable. 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite. 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Darryl Talley corralled McNair at the one-yard line as the 
celebrating began. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say that we should be proud of everything we have accomplished," 
Allen said when it was over, "and I think that taste in our mouth should bring 
us back next year." 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, the Chiefs are going home. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Bills are going back to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Eat your heart out, America.

NFL PLAYOFFS / XXVIII LOOKS JUST LIKE XXVII; 49ERS LOS COOL, AND THE GAME; 
COWBOYS: VICTORY GUARANTEE BY JOHNSON MIGHT HAVE MADE SAN FRANCISCO PLAYERS A 
LITTLE TOO ANGRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before laying the myth of the San Francisco 49ers to rest for another season, 
let us not forget their great comeback Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for them, it occurred before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Cowboys' Kevin Smith approached Jerry Rice in the end zone during 
the pregame to offer best wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice flipped him the bird. 
</P>
<P>
 What the comeback lacked in originality, it made up for in relevance. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite what history will show, the 38-21 victory by the Cowboys over the 
49ers in the NFC championship game occurred long before the opening kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
 How about, say, on Friday? 
</P>
<P>
 That's when the 49ers were privately enraged by Cowboy Coach Jimmy Johnson's 
victory guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when they realized they were not playing another predictable NFL team, 
but the University of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when they lost the one thing that had separated this organization from 
all others during the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when they lost their cool. 
</P>
<P>
 "When this game started," tackle Steve Wallace admitted, "we were really 
angry. We were ready to get it on." 
</P>
<P>
 And so they did. The pregame end zone shoving match that was caused by Rice's 
gesture was only the start of an afternoon where they were handcuffed by their 
emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They committed five cheap shots in the first nine minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Overzealous quarterback Steve Young threw a ball so hard, it bounced off 
John Taylor's hands and led to a game-turning interception. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cornerback Eric Davis tried to leap into a highlight film with a daring 
interception of his own, but instead was burned for a game-clinching touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers were still angry afterward, ripping the Cowboys for a lack of 
professionalism. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, after they extracted their heads from their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always try to win with class, and a few other NFL teams win with class, 
but it was different today," Wallace said. "A lot of the things these guys did, 
we would never do." 
</P>
<P>
 He was speaking of the Cowboys frequent taunting and dancing, not of their 
four touchdowns in five first-half drives. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's OK, as long as they keep winning, I guess they can keep doing 
whatever they want," Wallace said. "But we have long memories." 
</P>
<P>
 So do the Cowboys. Some of them still remember when the 49ers were as much 
arrogance as talent. 
</P>
<P>
 They were most proud that their ability to get inside the 49ers' blocking 
scheme was surpassed only by their ability to get inside their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever was talking about that, I hope they keep talking," Cowboy receiver 
Michael Irvin said. "Because it worked." 
</P>
<P>
 Something worked on Rice. He caught only six passes, none longer than 23 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think mentally, we got into Rice's head this week," Cowboy safety Darren 
Woodson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice acknowledged: "Yeah, they got under my hair a little bit . . . I thought 
what Johnson said was insane." 
</P>
<P>
 Something also worked on running back Ricky Watters. He scored four fewer 
touchdowns than in last week's playoff game against the New York Giants -- he 
had one Sunday -- while rushing for only 37 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 And something worked against the 49ers' veteran offensive line, which gave up 
four sacks and numerous other pressures on Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Johnson's pregame guarantee, 49er center Jesse Sapolu said, "It was all 
part of their strategy. You didn't see him saying that against the Green Bay 
Packers last week, did you? 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're not sure if you can win, make a statement like that, see what 
happens. Well, it worked." 
</P>
<P>
 And something certainly worked on Young. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when Jimmy made his statement, he was thinking, 'Well, Steve is 
playing pretty well, maybe I'll try to get at him a little bit,' " Young said. 
"That's something you do in college." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Young forgets that Johnson was a national champion at that level, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that it worked, but Young was so upset immediately afterward that he had 
difficulty speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am really trying to keep a stiff upper lip and all that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He later added: "I would never believe we would come down here and get beat by 
a score like this. I would never believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Young had his chance to be a hero. But once again, the big-game magic of his 
predecessor eluded him. 
</P>
<P>
 Four minutes into the second half, although still trailing by 21, the 
opportunity was given to Young. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers had the ball on their 43-yard line. Troy Aikman had just wobbled off 
the field with a concussion. Emmitt Smith had just thrown a block that left his 
right shoulder numb. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers had the Cowboys right where they wanted them. At least, that's what 
Joe Montana would have said. 
</P>
<P>
 Young had Rice open around the Cowboy 20-yard line, but underthrew the pass, 
causing Rice to stop and leap for the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all the time defender Larry Brown needed to knock the ball out of 
Rice's hands. 
</P>
<P>
 On second down, Young threw a screen pass behind Rice, with the ball falling 
incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 On third down, Young gave up on the long pass and flipped a screen to Watters 
that went for all of three yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers punted and, even though they scored on their next possession, an 
opportunity was lost. 
</P>
<P>
 And so Young will spend the summer wondering how someone can win three 
consecutive passing titles while losing two consecutive NFC championship games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were going to be poking at things in this game for a long time," Young 
said. "We had our chances right there in the third quarter and they shut the 
door on us." 
</P>
<P>
 That door will probably shut again on several 49er veterans as the team 
struggles this off-season to squeeze under the salary cap while revamping a 
pitiable defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to make changes, no question about that," Wallace said, shaking his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 He suddenly looked as old as his team and its reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to be up there," he said softly, longingly. "That used to be us on 
that mountain."

NFL PLAYOFFS / XXVIII LOOKS JUST LIKE XXVII; COWBOYS MAKE COACH AS GOOD AS HIS 
WORD; NFC: JOHNSON HAD PREDICTED A DECISIVE VICTORY OVER THE 49ERS, AND DALLAS 
GETS IT, 38-21, DESPITE THE LOSS OF AIKMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jimmy Johnson's brassy promise of a Cowboy victory in the NFC championship 
game rang true Sunday, and now how about the Buffalo Bills, the AFC's 
papier-mache representative the past three years in the Super Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be very quiet this week," Johnson said moments after running 
from the field, a fist waving in the air, his screams of joy fighting to top 
those of 64,902 fans in Texas Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys had defeated the 49ers, 38-21, much as Johnson had said they 
would, and now Johnson has the opportunity to become the first NFC coach in NFL 
history to guide a team to back-to-back Super Bowl victories. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Coach Johnson predicted that we were going to win this game, it showed 
the team something," Cowboy cornerback Larry Brown said. "You get a lot of 
coaches who are scared to say that, which shows they don't truly believe they 
can win the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The pumped-up Cowboys scuffled with the 49ers during pregame warm-ups, stormed 
to a 28-7 halftime lead and then overcame the loss of quarterback Troy Aikman, 
who suffered a concussion and was sent to Baylor Medical Center for overnight 
observation. Aikman is scheduled to have an MRI today and is expected to be 
ready to play in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas quarterback who was 14 of 18 for 177 yards and two touchdown 
passes, took a knee to the head with more than 11 minutes remaining in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He couldn't remember some of the plays and he was dazed," Johnson said. "We 
didn't want to take any risks, but I thought he would clear his head and return 
a few minutes later." 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman, however, complained of dizziness and left the field for the locker 
room. With four minutes remaining in the game, he was sent to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 After Aikman left the game, the 49ers attempted a rally. Ricky Watters, who 
gained 37 yards in 12 carries, ran four yards for a touchdown and the 49ers 
trailed by 28-14 with 5:47 left in the third quarter. "That was our window of 
opportunity," 49er Coach George Seifert said. "I honestly felt we were going to 
get back into this thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys turned to Bernie Kosar in relief of Aikman, and the 49ers went to 
their all-out blitz. On third and nine from the Cowboys' 19-yard line, Kosar 
beat a heavy rush and completed a 12-yard pass to Michael Irvin for a first 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was as big a play as there was in this game," Johnson said. "We were a 
little bit unraveled at the time, what with Troy being hurt, and that was just 
a great throw by Bernie." 
</P>
<P>
 Kosar, who had defeated the 49ers, 23-13, before being released by the Browns 
earlier this season, had signed a $1-million guaranteed contract to finish the 
season with the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 "An investment that obviously paid off," Cowboy owner Jerry Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 On third and three at the 49er 42, the 49ers blitzed and cornerback Eric Davis 
made an ill-advised attempt to intercept Kosar's pass for wide receiver Alvin 
Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way the game was going, we needed to make a play," Davis said. "We had to 
take some chances. I got a good read on the route and just went for it, but the 
ball floated on me." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis cut in front of Harper at the 49er 33, but the ball went over his head 
and into Harper's hands. Harper went untouched for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't the touchdown pass to Harper," Seifert said. "It was the play prior 
to that: the third-down pass to Irvin. Had we made that play, I suspect it may 
have been a different ballgame. But I wouldn't predict the outcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' miscalculation was not unlike the one made by teammate Don Griffin in 
last year's NFC championship game in San Francisco after the 49ers had rallied 
to trail the Cowboys, 24-20, in the fourth quarter. Griffin went for the ball, 
missed and Harper caught it and ran 70 yards to set up a touchdown for the 
Cowboys on their way to a 30-20 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thank God for this opportunity," said Kosar, the loser three times 
with Cleveland in AFC championship games. "I'm not accustomed to being a 
backup, but to play a role in a game that gets us to the Super Bowl is just a 
great feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys, who will be making their seventh trip to the Super Bowl -- the 
most by any NFL franchise -- took control of the game almost before it began. 
After 49er wide receiver Jerry Rice exchanged unpleasantries with Cowboy 
cornerback Kevin Smith during pregame warm-ups, players from both teams began 
shoving each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerry Rice came over and started popping off," Cowboy defensive lineman Jim 
Jeffcoat said. "That's the worst thing he could have done. I guess he doesn't 
realize he's in Cowboys country. Don't ever come in here and challenge us like 
that, or we'll destroy you." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys, who appeared much stronger than the 49ers along the offensive 
line, on special teams and overall on defense, appeared intent on punishing the 
49ers once the game began. And as running back Emmitt Smith said later, "It was 
easier than we expected." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who shunned a pain shot for his injured shoulder before the game, 
carried seven times on the Cowboys' opening drive, which covered 75 yards in 11 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith ran five yards for a touchdown to give Dallas a 7-0 lead, and from the 
outset, the 49er defense appeared overmatched. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys had an opportunity for a 14-0 lead on their second possession, but 
after beating Davis in the end zone, Harper dropped what would have been a 
39-yard touchdown pass from Aikman. 
</P>
<P>
 After 49er quarterback Steve Young threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to 
fullback Tom Rathman on the opening play of the second quarter, the rest of the 
half belonged to the Cowboy offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys took possession three times and three times they scored. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the kind of game you live for," said Norv Turner, the Cowboys' 
offensive coordinator who is expected to become Washington's head coach after 
the Super Bowl. "What a great first half of football." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullback Daryl Johnston capped an 80-yard drive with a four-yard touchdown run 
to give Dallas a 14-7 lead, and then safety Thomas Everett put the Cowboys in 
scoring position again after intercepting a deflected Young pass at the 49er 38 
and returning it to the 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Four plays later, the 49er defense failed to cover Smith, and Aikman found him 
for an 11-yard score over the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys completed the first-half scoring after tight end Jay Novacek put a 
move on linebacker Bill Romanowski and broke free to catch a 19-yard touchdown 
pass from Aikman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was shock to look at the scoreboard and see that it was 21-7 and then 
28-7," 49er tackle Steve Wallace said. "We never had a chance to get into our 
game plan, and the crowd continued to stay in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 After Harper's touchdown, the Cowboys added a 50-yard Eddie Murray field goal 
in the fourth quarter to extend their lead to 38-14 before Young finished the 
scoring with a one-yard plunge with 4:06 left. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we came out on the field, we felt right away we were the better team," 
Cowboy guard Nate Newton said. "I mean, Jimmy done guaranteed it."

MIKE DOWNEY: NFL PLAYOFFS / XXVIII LOOKS JUST LIKE XXVII; MONTANA HAS ONE OF 
THOSE DAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I still don't remember much," Joe Montana said, knocked goofy and not going 
to Disneyland. "Soon as I landed, everything went white for a couple of 
seconds. And there was a sharp pain in my head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't remember anything for most of the third quarter. I didn't know 
what was going on. I couldn't remember what the score was, or how they got 20 
points." 
</P>
<P>
 Dazed. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana was dazed. That was the word a team doctor used to describe the 
condition of the quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs, who, with a mild 
concussion, missed most of the second half of Sunday's AFC championship game. 
Montana's mind was dazed and his eyes were glazed after a 30-13 defeat, 
symptoms he shared with millions of football fans dreading another Super Bowl 
appearance by the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer than 90 seconds into the third quarter, Montana was hit high, low and 
sideways by three Buffalo tacklers upon release of a 17-yard completed pass to 
Keith Cash. Pinballing into him -- possibly a little late -- were 270-pound 
nose tackle Jeff Wright, who came in shoulder high, followed by 275-pound left 
defensive end Phil Hansen, who took out the ankles, and finally 273-pound right 
defensive end Bruce Smith, who smothered the 205-pound quarterback on the way 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana's helmet struck the artificial turf. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think so," he said later. "That's what they told me." 
</P>
<P>
 His season was over. Dave Krieg relieved the groggy Montana at quarterback. 
While he sat on the bench attempting to get the cuckoo back into his clock, 
Krieg, on Kansas City's next possession, moved the team the length of the 
field. Although Buffalo already had 20 points, which was news to Montana, the 
game was tight again because Krieg had done what Montana had not -- driven the 
Chiefs to a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 But Marcus Allen's one-yard plunge was the only scoring of the half for the 
Chiefs' offense, which snuggled in cloaks on the sideline waiting for Buffalo's 
Thurman Thomas to get tired. Thomas' three-yard touchdown run with 5 1/2 
minutes remaining confirmed the Bills' reservations for their return engagement 
to the Super Bowl -- or, as a banner here described it, "The Road To Atlanta 
Goes Through Montana." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas outrushed Allen by 136 yards on a day dominated by running backs. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how impressed he was with what he saw of Thomas' rushing, Allen said: "I 
didn't really get to see him much. But I heard the announcer quite often say, 
'First down,' 'First down,' 'First down,' and so on and so on." 
</P>
<P>
 Their careers once in jeopardy, Montana and Allen returned to active duty this 
season with style. Yet this was hardly the way they wanted to go out. Not with 
Montana completing only nine passes and suffering a lethal interception late in 
the first half. And not with Allen averaging 2.8 yards per carry and getting 24 
of his 50 rushing yards on a single play. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither needed be accountable for a total Kansas City breakdown, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana swallowed the blame for nine dropped passes, faulting neither his 
receivers nor a football slippery from a steady mist. He said: "I had guys 
open. It was just my inability to get them the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Coach Marty Schottenheimer asked officials to cover the football and 
keep it dry after numerous drops. He said it was slick, particularly during the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana noticed the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then I kept going, 'Damn, Jim (Kelly) isn't having a problem with it,' " 
Montana said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cursed throughout the '90s by injury, Montana at least awoke a new passion, 
along with Allen, among football fans in Kansas City, where during the past 
week many of them clapped along to something called "The Schottenheimer Polka" 
and expected Montana to escort them to the big Super Bowl dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Didn't work out that way. The season ended unhappily. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Allen: "We knew the road to the Super Bowl would be tough because that 
road goes through Buffalo." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the Chiefs persuaded themselves that they had lost not only to a 
better team, but to the best NFL team, in spite of Buffalo's previous 
championship flops. Derrick Thomas, for one, dared to say that if the Bills 
play up to their capabilities, "I don't see anybody beating them."  
</P>
<P>
 This seemed a mouthful, but Schottenheimer spouted one, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they put their minds to it, they are a handful," the losing coach said 
of the Bills. "And I don't want to put any jinx on them, but if Buffalo goes to 
play next week anywhere near how they played today, then all those people who 
have been the doomsday people about this Buffalo team can just pack it away, 
because Buffalo is a hell of a football team." 
</P>
<P>
 Sounded a little dazed himself there.

UNSER'S MOVE IN FAMILY TRADITION; AUTO RACING: DRIVER SWITCHED TO PENSKE TEAM 
AFTER AN UNHAPPY PARTING OF THE WAYS WITH GALLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 11 years as an Indy car driver, Al Unser Jr. has had a remarkable career -- 
he has won the Indianapolis 500, the PPG Cup national championship and 19 races 
-- but the second-generation driver from Albuquerque, N.M., says his best years 
are ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm with the best team I've ever had," he said the other day. "Now that I'm 
with Roger Penske, I don't see how things can get anything but better." 
</P>
<P>
 After three seasons with Doug Shierson and eight with Rick Galles, Unser 
signed with Penske, the winningest owner in Indy car history, after the 1993 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been wanting to get with Penske for a long time," Unser said. "My dad 
(four-time Indy 500 winner Al Unser) and my uncle Bobby (three-time Indy 
winner) both drove for Penske and both of them told me nothing but good things 
could happen to me if I made the move." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1969, Penske-owned cars have won nine Indianapolis 500s, eight Indy car 
championships and 79 races, including eight of 16 last year. The late Lou Moore 
is a distant second among owners with 38 victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Unser is now part of a three-driver team with Emerson Fittipaldi of Brazil, 
last year's Indy 500 winner and a two-time Formula One champion, and Paul Tracy 
of Canada, winner of five races in his first full Indy car season last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I've always said I wanted to be a one-driver team, but all of the top 
teams have two drivers now," Unser said. "Penske is just taking it one step 
farther. The way I look at it, with three drivers testing, we get that much 
more information. Each one of us has our own engineer and crew chief and (team 
manager) Chuck Sprague makes sure all the information is pooled and everyone 
gets the same input. 
</P>
<P>
 "That didn't happen with Galles, and that's one of the main reasons I wanted 
out, even though we had a good run together. Galles told me that Danny Sullivan 
and I would share everything we learned, but then I'd show up at a race and 
Danny would have things on his car that I didn't have. 
</P>
<P>
 "When something like that happens, and it happened several times, it 
undermines your confidence. Then, when Danny took me out at Long Beach in '92 
when we could have run 1-2 -- and got congratulated for it -- I knew it was 
time to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 With two laps remaining in the Long Beach Grand Prix, Unser was leading in 
quest of a record fifth consecutive victory on the street course when he was 
tapped from behind by teammate Sullivan. The impact spun Unser around, allowing 
Sullivan to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Galles' reaction: "I thought it was a whale of a race, and a clean race." 
Unser, although he denied it at the time, apparently thought otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan was released by Galles last week when his sponsor dropped out of 
racing. That leaves Galles with only one driver, rookie Adrian Fernandez of 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Unser said he first had thoughts of leaving Galles nearly two years ago when 
he was told that the Galmer chassis building program was being shut down. 
Galles and car designer Alan Mertens had formed a partnership in 1990 to build 
their own car instead of racing store-bought Lolas. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I signed a three-year contract with Galles in 1990, I was promised my 
own race car, which is what you need these days to win consistently," Unser 
said. "The car didn't show up until 1992, but it was a good car. It won Indy -- 
we were awfully lucky -- and was very reliable. That's why we won Indy, because 
we were there at the finish after Michael (Andretti) dropped out." 
</P>
<P>
 Andretti led 163 of the 200 laps, often by nearly a full lap, before the car 
sputtered to a stop with 11 laps remaining. Unser beat Scott Goodyear to the 
wire in the closest finish in Indy car history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was devastated the night before Indy when Rick told me he was shooting the 
Galmer project down," Unser said. "I was stunned, shocked. Winning the next day 
didn't change anything. As far as I was concerned, the race team went downhill 
from then on." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the announcement of Unser's move to Penske was not revealed until 
after the final race of 1993 last October at Laguna Seca, negotiations were 
under way much earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roger and I have talked about getting together for a number of years, but 
every time he had an opening, I couldn't move, and when I could move, he didn't 
have an opening. We were just out of sync. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to keep it quiet during the season because when moves like that get 
out early, it hurts both teams. I still had races to run for Galles and I 
wanted to win as much as ever, and Emmo (Fittipaldi) was going for the 
championship so Roger didn't want any disruptions." 
</P>
<P>
 Unser's only victory last year was at Vancouver, in August. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only disappointing thing for me was that I wasn't able to leave after the 
'92 season," he said. "I told Galles I wanted out. One day he would tell me he 
didn't want a driver around who didn't want to be around, and the next day he'd 
tell me he was holding me to my contract. I just had to swallow my pride and 
get on with it. It made for a long year. But now I'm free." 
</P>
<P>
 Unser has been testing Penske's new car, a '94 Marlboro Penske Ilmor V-8, 
since it arrived in early December from the team shops in Poole, England. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's hardly any difference between it and the '93 car, which is fine 
because the '93 was the best chassis on the circuit last year," he said. "The 
Chevy engine was a little down on horsepower to the Ford Cosworth. This year we 
hope the new Ilmor D engine will give us more horsepower." 
</P>
<P>
 Nigel Mansell won the Indy car championship last year in a Lola powered by a 
Ford Cosworth, but the next three, Fittipaldi, Tracy and Bobby Rahal, all had 
Chevrolet engines. Unser, in a Lola-Chevrolet, finished seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevrolet, which lent its nameplate to the Ilmor Engineering engine for a 
substantial sum of money for the last eight years, withdrew from Indy car 
racing last October. However, Mario Illian and Paul Morgan, who founded Ilmor, 
announced that they would continue to build engines, including the new D model 
for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've tested well and our lap times compare favorably with what we've heard 
from other teams, but you never know until you get down and run in race 
conditions," Unser said. "What I really like is that we're testing and testing 
is what gets results."  
</P>
<P>
 Last Monday, a test at Phoenix ended abruptly when a cut tire sent the new 
Penske into the wall coming out of the fourth turn. 
</P>
<P>
 "The car spun around and went in (the wall) backwards," Unser said. "It hit 
square with the gearbox and knocked the wind out of me. It usually doesn't do 
that, but it did this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tub never hit with the front end, so we were lucky. It wasn't as bad a 
hit as it could have been." 
</P>
<P>
 Unser sees the 1994 season, which will start March 20 in Australia, as the 
most competitive since he joined the circuit at 20 for the 1982 Riverside race. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nigel will be back with a year's experience and Mario (Andretti) will be 
tough because he wants to make a strong showing in his last year. Then Michael 
(Andretti) is back (from Formula One) with a Reynard that has tested very quick 
with the Ford Cosworth engine. Reynard has a great track record in building 
chassis for other series, so it should be quick right out of the box in 
Michael's hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bobby Rahal has a new Honda engine that Mike Groff has been testing. From the 
way Honda performed in Formula One, I imagine he'll be very strong. Robby 
Gordon was quick at times last year and now that he's moved (from A.J. Foyt) to 
Derrick Walker, he should do a lot better. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting tougher and tougher every year. I'm just glad I made the move I 
made. It's a great feeling to know that I'm driving for the best team in 
racing."

NFL PLAYOFFS / DAILY REPORT; AFC; BEAUTY OF BILLS IS DEFINITELY IN EYE OF 
BEHOLDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For calling the Buffalo Bills the "serial killers of the Super Bowl," 
columnist Mike Lupica of the New York Daily News made few new friends here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stop the Bills before they kill another Super Bowl," Lupica wrote before 
Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Stop the Bills' is no longer just a smart throwaway line. . . . It is a 
rallying cry, in 49 states and most of New York as you move east. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bills' general manager, someone named John Butler, said, 'I know the 
media (roots against the Bills), because they want new faces and different 
stories. But I think the average fan likes us.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe Butler was struck in the head by a rogue snowplow. The average fan does 
not like the Bills." 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, a die-hard Bill fan, responded: "I like Mike 
Lupica, but this is the end of his credibility." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here's Butler, the general manager, on his Bills after Sunday's game: 
</P>
<P>
 "Again, they showed just how amazing they are. I absolutely love this team. 
They are an amazing, amazing bunch of people to get done what they did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thurman Thomas, what other way can you put it other than we have a chance to 
witness one of the greatest running backs who ever put on a uniform? When you 
look at an all-around running back, I dare someone to tell me there's a finer 
running back in the game. I'd like to know who he is. If he's still out there, 
I'll try and draft him. If he's retired, I'd wish him the best, because he'll 
probably be in the Hall of Fame, where Thurman will be." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Ralph Wilson was effusive, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it'll probably be 75 or 100 years -- really, I'm serious -- before a 
team wins four consecutive conference championships. Because everybody in 
football knows how difficult this is." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How big are the Bills in Buffalo? The Empire cable TV sports network here 
features "The Marv Levy Show" Mondays at 8 p.m.; "The Thurman Thomas Show" 
Wednesdays at 7:30 p.m.; "The Frank Reich Show" Thursdays at 7 p.m., and "The 
Don Beebe Show" Fridays at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich is the team's backup quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Russell Copeland aided the Bills' winning cause with 133 yards in kick 
returns and the first-year man from Memphis State could be of further use. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I'm new to this Super Bowl thing," Copeland said. "Maybe they've been 
waiting for me." MIKE DOWNEY

 Buffalo defensive lineman Bruce Smith: "All we heard all week long was how 
everybody wants to see Joe Montana and the Dallas Cowboys or San Francisco, and 
we hadn't even played yet. That's no respect at all. . . . The hell with what 
everybody wants to see.If they don't want to watch, don't turn the TV on."

 Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly on the play of his offensive line: "They opened

 When the Bills and Chiefs met in the regular season at the end of November, 
the Chiefs won, 23-7, coming up with four sacks and three interceptions. 
Sunday, Kansas City got neither a sack nor an interception. . . . Thomas set a 
team playoff record with his 186 yards rushing, but it is only the 
fourth-highest total in postseason history. Eric Dickerson set the record as a 
Ram when he rushed for 248 yards against the Cowboys in 1985. . . . Thomas 
scored three touchdowns on the ground Sunday and Kansas City's Marcus Allen got 
one. That gives each of them 11 in the postseason, tying them for third on the 
all-time list. Franco Harris of the Pittsburgh Steelers is the career leader 
with 16, followed by John Riggins of the Washington Redskins with 12. . . . 
Buffalo Coach Levy has won both postseason games in which he has faced Kansas 
City Coach Marty Schottenheimer, but is 0-4 lifetime against Schottenheimer in 
the regular season. . . . Schottenheimer is now 0-3 in AFC title games, having 
lost his previous two to the Denver Broncos. STEVE SPRINGER

 They appeared to forget about him, and imagine that, overlooking Emmitt Smith, 
the NFL's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second quarter, however, Smith ran uncovered into the 49ers' secondary 
and caught an 11-yard touchdown pass to give the Cowboys a 21-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the same Emmitt Smith who ran six times and caught a 28-yard pass on 
the Cowboys' opening drive, which ended with a five-yard touchdown run -- by 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 The same Emmitt Smith, who had the ball handed or thrown in his direction on 
the first four plays of the team's second drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just seemed to forget all about me," said Smith, who ran 23 times for 88 
yards and caught seven passes for 85 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who carried only twice last week against Green Bay in the second half 
after aggravating an injured shoulder, appeared to run without difficulty 
against the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shoulder held up fine . . . I'm still standing," Smith said. 
</P>

 Coach Jimmy Johnson explained his reasoning after Sunday's game on why he 
predicted a victory earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he sensed that his players were tight earlier in the week, "and I 
did something to loosen them up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also thought it would be a good way to get the crowd into it. The people 
were as loud as I have ever heard them here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he expects a great Super Bowl. "People talk about last year's 
game, but they had nine turnovers and that really made for a big difference in 
the score." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys defeated the Bills, 52-17, last year, and in his book, "Turning 
The Thing Around," Johnson said that he had gone into the prediction business 
shortly before that game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told our coaches while jogging that we were going to win," Johnson said. 
"It wasn't a big deal, though, because no media was around to hear it." T.J.

 Charles Haley, former 49er outcast, celebrated his second consecutive 
championship game victory over his former teammates as if it were the most 
important game he will play this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was my Super Bowl," said Haley, the Cowboy defensive end who had one 
sack and one blocked pass."We play Buffalo in the Super Bowl, it's just another 
game for me. This is my game right here. Everybody knows how I feel about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Steve Young of the 49ers certainly knows. Because Haley was in the 
backfield on nearly every play, Young spent as much time talking to Haley as 
his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "All afternoon, we talked," Young said. "He would knock me down and I would 
say 'Nice hit,' or I would get off a good throw and he would say, 'Nice pass.' 
"

<P>
 Apparently, baseball clubs aren't the only sports franchises that can build a 
team to fit a stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers claim that the Cowboys are the perfect team for Texas Stadium. They 
say the combination of their speedy defense, and the noise inside the partially 
enclosed stadium, is tough to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "They get off the ball so quick, and it's so loud, it's hard for the linemen 
to pick each other up and let each other know what is going on," tackle Steve 
Wallace said. "They are in there before you know it, and there's not much you 
can do about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace said there was another factor Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know Jimmy told the people to get drunk before the game," he said. "By the 
sounds of things, they listened to him." BILL PLASCHKE

</P>
<P>
 The Associated Press poll will be out today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins (13-0) are the nation's top-ranked team for the first time since 
January of 1983, when Larry Farmer was the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, UCLA was tied with Kansas for the No. 1 spot in the USA Today/CNN 
poll and ranked No. 2 behind Kansas in the AP poll. The Jayhawks (17-2) lost to 
Kansas State on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins defeated No. 9-ranked Arizona Thursday night and Arizona State 
Saturday. UCLA was a near-unanimous selection for the top spot in the USA 
Today/CNN poll, receiving 33 of 34 first-place votes and 849 points from the 
coaches' panel. No. 2 Duke (13-1) got the other first-place voice.

 Tonya Harding approached two unidentified men at a Portland gym about "bumping 
off" Jeff Gillooly, her husband, during their separation last summer after she 
suspected him of stealing her truck, the Oregonian newspaper reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oregonian quoted neither of the two men directly and provided no separate 
support for the allegations.Neither Harding nor Gillooly commented on the 
allegations and calls to their attorneys Sunday by the Associated Press were 
not returned. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was furious," the Oregonian quoted an unidentified source as saying. "She 
told two men -- some people she worked out with at an eastside gym, some people 
she barely knew -- that she wanted Gillooly taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
 The report comes amid accusations by her onetime bodyguard, Shawn Eckardt, 
that Harding and Gillooly helped plan and cover up the attack on Nancy Kerrigan 
in Detroit on Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding has denied the accusations and has not been charged with any crime.

<P>
 Pat Day became the 10th rider to win 6,000 races, in the first race at Oaklawn 
Park on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Day, 40, rode Miss Popsnorkle to a six-length victory.She paid $12. 
</P>
<P>
 Day, who has won four Eclipse Awards, won No. 5,000 on Nov. 22, 1990, at 
Churchill Downs aboard Pete Vestal-trained Screen Prospect. Vestal also trained 
Miss Popsnorkle. 
</P>
<P>
 Day's 4,000th victory came March 29, 1988, at Oaklawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Day rode three winners on Friday, opening day at Oaklawn. He flew to 
California and rode two winners Saturday, including Tabasco Cat in the El 
Camino at Bay Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do it and get it over with," said Day, who is seeking his 12th 
consecutive Oaklawn riding title. "It is a wonderful feeling. I wanted to reach 
6,000 here at Oaklawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a do or die situation. I knew if I remained healthy, it was going 
to come." 
</P>
<P>
 He said his only regret was that his family couldn't be on hand for the 
occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Shoemaker has the record of 8,833. The others with 6,000 are Laffit 
Pincay, Angel Cordero, Jorge Velasquez, Larry Snyder, David Gall, Carl 
Gambardella, Johnny Longden and Sandy Hawley.

SOUTHERN SECTION TIGHTENS ITS BELT; HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS: MEMBERS OF THE 
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAVE MORE BUSINESS, LESS PLEASURE DURING GETAWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For many of the top high school athletic administrators in Southern 
California, the new year has always been something to look forward to. It meant 
football season was complete, basketball was in full swing and the school year 
was half over. 
</P>
<P>
 And it also meant a weekend getaway with associates, during which business was 
mixed with pleasure, was around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1986, the governing body of the California Interscholastic Federation's 
Southern Section, which oversees nearly 500 schools, has routinely moved its 
January meeting from the section's board room to a resort hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18 members of the Executive Committee and their spouses were invited by 
the section's commissioner to attend a three-day weekend retreat of meetings, 
cocktail parties, dinners and golf. The Southern Section, a nonprofit 
organization that relies in part on school dues, picked up the tab. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last two years, the January meeting has been held at the Doubletree 
Resort in Palm Springs. In 1992, the Executive Committee meeting cost the 
section $10,392, of which $1,752 was spent on golf and golf equipment. The 
committee spent $9,155 last year, including $1,611 on golf. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Thomas organized those weekends. He was the section's commissioner from 
1986 until last October, when he resigned after a lengthy audit showed he had 
abused his expense account by more than $35,000 from 1991-93. He was ordered to 
pay $5,000 restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 With the section facing a $112,000 deficit accumulated over the last two 
years, many in the organization questioned such lavish spending on meetings 
that could have been held at the office in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who think things have gotten out of hand are exactly right," said Gary 
Smidderks, president of the Executive Committee and superintendent of Los 
Angeles Baptist High in North Hills. "In all fairness, though, I do not think 
the committee understood the kind of spending that was going on or the deficit 
that was building. When all of this came to light, we took care of the matter 
in the best way we knew how." 
</P>
<P>
 This month's meeting was to be held at the stately Ojai Country Club, but 
Smidderks said the section could not afford it in light of its budget problems. 
He moved the meeting to the Holiday Inn in Buellton, near Santa Barbara, and it 
was two days instead of three, last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding Executive Committee meetings at hotels is nothing new. It's a 
tradition started by Kenneth Fagans, commissioner from 1954-75. Of the 
Executive Committee's seven regularly scheduled meetings each year, two have 
usually been held at hotels and another at Anaheim Stadium in conjunction with 
an Angel game. The other four usually have been at the section's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Plutko, section commissioner from 1980-86, said he held meetings at hotels 
in June and August of each year. One was to wrap up the school year, and the 
other to set the agenda for the upcoming one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought they were important because Executive Committee members are 
volunteers and this was a way of saying 'thank you' for their services," said 
Plutko, now the principal at Temple City High. "But I watched the expenses very 
closely. I shopped around for the best room deals I could find. We went to Palm 
Springs in August." 
</P>
<P>
 When Thomas replaced Plutko, he decided to move the June getaway weekend to 
January. He selected fancier hotels, which were always connected with a golf 
course. And he started making golf part of the agenda, something Plutko had 
never done. Thomas and many committee members often played a round on Friday 
afternoon and another on Sunday morning. They did section business on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Executive Committee members consider these weekends a perk, and that is not 
unreasonable," Thomas said. "But when they travel, they like to go first class. 
They order room service. And they often like to have drinks in the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "They also enjoyed playing golf, and they never questioned when I would pick 
up the tab. They were not offering any reimbursement out of their pockets, 
either." 
</P>
<P>
 The Executive Committee sets policy, oversees the budget and listens to 
appeals of athletes, among other things. Most members are principals or 
superintendents from school districts throughout the area. Some travel from as 
far away as Atascadero, Bishop and Rialto. 
</P>
<P>
 They are voted in by the section's council, which is made up of a 
representative from each league. They have the final say in all section 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
 They are reimbursed for business mileage and an occasional meal, but Executive 
Committee members get little else for their services. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were to charge the CIF for the time I put in, they couldn't afford me," 
said Robert Packer, a committee member and former president of the State CIF 
council. "My consultation fee would normally be $500 a day. For want of a 
dinner, lunch, continental breakfast and perhaps another dinner, you are 
getting a lot of professional service for the high schools of Southern 
California. I think the getaways are very important." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone agrees. Cynthia Grennan, a former committee member and the 
superintendent of the Anaheim Union High School District for the last 15 years, 
said she never felt comfortable at such meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a believer in athletics and activities," Grennan aid. "But I don't think 
excessive expenditures can be allowed right now. Over the last few years, I 
have had to fuss over declining budgets, staff reductions and loss of programs. 
I can't spend a lavish weekend away with money that I could be using for my 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
 School districts throughout the area have reduced their budgets the last few 
years because of funding cuts on the state level. Athletics have also suffered, 
with many districts eliminating lower level programs, reducing coaching 
stipends, and in some cases, charging athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Southern Section's budget has grown from $717,291 in 1983 to 
$1,310,193 in 1993. It increased every year under Thomas, who was earning 
$85,800 per year when he resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from school dues, money for the section is raised from gate receipts 
from football, basketball and volleyball playoffs and corporate sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
 The Executive Committee has not closely monitored the budget because a deficit 
has been rare. And few questioned Thomas' spending habits. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee held its last two August meetings at the Singing Hills Country 
Club and Lodge in El Cajon. It spent $7,840 in 1992, including $1,570 on golf; 
and $6,003 last year, including $1,320 on golf. El Cajon is outside of San 
Diego and not in the Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said spouses were encouraged to attend, and many members also brought 
their children. In very few cases, he said, was the section reimbursed for the 
extra expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, I suggested to the committee that we only travel once," Thomas 
said. "They said 'no' to that. These meetings were important to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Things have begun to change since Thomas' resignation. With much of the 
section's spending made public, the Executive Committee formed a finance 
committee in October. Headed by Tom Triggs, principal at Buena Park High, the 
finance committee has put the section on a hiring freeze and is auditing all 
expense reports, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Crowley, acting commissioner, said his office staff is down 25%, but is 
doing business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want to make it through the year and take it from there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smidderks said the spending spree is over. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had my druthers, the Executive Committee would have been more 
responsible for their expenses," he said. "Some of this is certainly our 
fault."

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; PLAYERS' GROUP IS NOT EXPECTED TO WELCOME SALARY-CAP 
PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Major League Players Assn. will ask two basic questions of baseball's 
seemingly determined and united owners when the owners lay out their salary-cap 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why is it needed? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Do we share in decisions as to how revenue is generated, or are we partners 
in name only? 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the owners have agreed to a revenue-sharing formula to fund a 
salary-cap system of compensation, collective bargaining negotiations are 
expected to begin soon. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little reason to believe the players will be pleased with the answers 
to their questions. 
</P>
<P>
 There also is little reason to believe that an eighth consecutive 
negotiations-related work stoppage -- either in September of the 1994 season or 
in the spring of '95 -- can be averted. 
</P>
<P>
 It's this simple: 
</P>
<P>
 The union does not believe a $1.7-billion industry is in financial peril or 
requires a new compensation system. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does it believe the owners will ever allow players to sit in on major 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 As Don Fehr, the union's executive director, noted after the owners had 
finally agreed to revenue sharing: "We were deliberately kept in the dark again 
and excluded from the process. When does the partnership begin?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the full sense, probably never. Even Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief 
negotiator, acknowledged as much the other day when he referred to the 
salary-cap agreements in the NBA and NFL and said: 
</P>
<P>
 "Not by precedent or otherwise has it been demonstrated that a salary cap has 
to be accompanied by player control (of economic decisions)." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr's response is that NFL players had to swallow a salary cap in return for 
free agency and that NBA players agreed to it at a time when the league was 
near death, and that they will attempt to remove it in the next negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 He calls the cap concept troublesome and knows it will be accompanied by an 
equally troublesome attempt to severely modify arbitration and free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the owners want to redistribute their revenue, let them do it," he said. 
"We've never cared how they did it, as long as it didn't adversely affect the 
free market, but now they want the players' cooperation in restricting the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can color it any way you want, but that's what a salary cap does. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other troublesome aspect is that the owners refuse to involve the players 
in their decisions, but they are now willing to redistribute revenue to the 
very owners who have shown no ability to manage it or generate it." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the revenue-sharing formula that will be implemented only if the owners 
get their salary cap, the list of clubs that would pay and receive would change 
annually, depending on their economic profiles. 
</P>
<P>
 If implemented today, a baseball official said, Montreal and Milwaukee, at the 
lowest end of the revenue ladder, would receive about $9.5 million, and the 
Dodgers, among big-revenue clubs, would contribute about $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who have the seventh-lowest revenue, according to industry 
accounting, would get about $3 million, but would have to increase their 
payroll more than that to satisfy the minimum funding requirements of the 
salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has nothing to do with helping the Angels make a profit," owner Jackie 
Autry said in Florida the other day. "It will only help bring our payroll up to 
the required level. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's up to us to work out other areas of income. I mean, (coupled) with the 
right lease (at Anaheim Stadium), it will help correct some of our problems, 
but we need to get back up from having the seventh-lowest revenue to the top so 
that we can give rather than receive." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr, however, is not alone in his belief that if some clubs have economic 
problems, mismanagement is the reason. Two owners of high-revenue clubs, Peter 
O'Malley of the Dodgers and George Steinbrenner of the New York Yankees, voiced 
similar concerns before agreeing to the formula. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Ravitch argues that there is a legitimate disparity among the 
clubs' revenue sources -- "some clubs' payrolls exceed the gross revenues of 
other clubs" -- and unless a measure of balance is achieved through revenue 
redistribution, the competitive balance will be jeopardized, along with 
economic viability. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (national) TV revenue provided many clubs with false security, but the 
bloom is off that rose," Ravitch said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't be easy, but (a new system is) so critically important that I'm 
confident we can reach resolution with the union. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can the union be happy with a system in which 10% of the players receive 50% 
of the compensation and more and more veterans are being forced out in favor of 
rookies making the minimum salary?" 
</P>
<P>
 The union's response: So be it. 
</P>
<P>
 The market, it says, has always and will continue to respond to economic 
conditions and adjust itself, barring collusion. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no conspiracy now. The owners are out in the open on this, and Ravitch 
has a seemingly free hand. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no commissioner to intercede, as Fay Vincent did in the 1990 lockout, 
and the threat of capitulation by the often divided owners seems to have been 
reduced by a change requiring three-fourths approval of a new labor agreement 
or work stoppage rather than simple majority. 
</P>
<P>
 So the owners gear for acrimony while talking about an end to their 
acrimonious relationship with the union. Will this be a negotiation to cap all 
others? Bet on it.

 At a time when contributions to the Orange County Performing Arts Center have 
already been hard hit by the recession, organizers of a big fund-raiser for the 
center -- the glitzy annual Center of Fashion show -- are preparing to cancel 
this year's gala. 
</P>
<P>
 Beset by internal dissent and financial hardship among retailers, board 
members of the center's guilds -- the support group that organizes the benefit 
-- will meet Thursday to consider a recommendation by its executive committee 
to delay this year's event, which would have been the fifth annual, until the 
fall of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just need a little between time," said Shari Esayian, a Newport Beach 
resident who will become chairwoman of a 1995 event. 
</P>
<P>
 Esayian, who was Center of Fashion chairwoman in 1991, said the guilds 
circulated a questionnaire among the fashion retailers who participated in last 
year's show, and "everyone felt it needed a little rest." 
</P>
<P>
 She noted that even if the board decided it wanted to sponsor a show this 
fall, "we're too late" to put it together. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Sutherland, the center's new managing director of development, said of 
the potential loss of funds: "If there are any decisions that affect the budget 
of an organization, what one does is find ways to make up for whatever holes 
may be punched into a budget." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the '93 show brought in approximately $105,000 for the center, the 
event cost more than $300,000 to produce because the guilds paid for the 
professional dancers, producers, printing and rent for the center. The 1990 
show made $110,000, followed by $175,000 the next year and $150,000 for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 A show cancellation would mean more bad economic news for the center, which 
last week announced that it missed its 1993 fund-raising goal by 20% and had to 
dip into a "programming subsidy" to avoid red ink. The center had established a 
fund-raising goal of $5 million, but $4.1 million was raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Postponing the fund-raiser would also be a setback to many involved with the 
production. The annual fall event features guild members and professional 
models wearing designer fashions from upscale Orange County stores. Last year, 
its afternoon and evening shows attracted an audience of more than 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The guilds are the oldest center support group. They were established 15 years 
ago to help build the center, which opened in 1986, and now have 2,600 members 
throughout the county. The nine guilds continue to donate money to the center 
for its operating expenses; last year they donated about $500,000, according to 
Greg Patterson, center spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't directly receive revenues from the Center of Fashion," Patterson 
said. "When they give money back to the center . . . it's in one lump sum. The 
guilds have many activities, and the Center of Fashion is (just) one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Money is also a problem for the show's participants. Esayian said the guilds 
are finding it difficult to ask stores year in and year out to come up with the 
$2,500 required to be represented in the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a heavy tapping of the same people," she said of the 19 stores that 
participated last year. "Retailers almost make one (payment) when it's time to 
hit them for another." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the entry fee, retailers incur extra costs to promote the event 
within their stores and loan fashions for the production. 
</P>
<P>
 "As much as we'd love to support the Performing Arts Center, it is very, very 
expensive," said Michele Vicale, store manager of South Coast Plaza's Escada, 
which dropped out of the show after participating in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "These days you want the maximum amount of exposure for your dollar, but at 
the Center of Fashion you share the stage with so many people. It's a much 
better return when you go one-on-one with a group," said Vicale, who instead of 
participating in the Center of Fashion last year invited the guilds' Sound of 
Music chapter into the store for informal modeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "As budgets get cut back, it's always the promotions and marketing that goes 
first, before staff," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vicale would also like the guilds to change the production. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are ready for a different format. I just don't know how many years you 
can keep doing the same thing," she said. "The novelty of it has worn off." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The guilds began reviewing the Center of Fashion's format after last year's 
production raised complaints within guild ranks about the show's direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Some members said the Center of Fashion was alienating its community 
supporters by putting too much emphasis on producing a slick, professional 
show. Specifically, they complained the model selection process had become too 
stringent, and that powerful Orange County women who had contributed big 
dollars to the center were being left off the model list because they didn't 
have model figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't use enough of the doers and shakers in the community. It became 
more of a professional model show," said Janice Johnson, a former guilds 
chairwoman who founded the Center of Fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year the Center of Fashion added about 20 professionals to its roster of 
100 amateur models. Auditions were held so that only those guild members who 
met strict size, weight and appearance requirements were allowed to model. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of our top women in the community weren't asked to model," Johnson 
said. "You need the whole community in back of (the show) and excited about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson got the idea for the show from a similar fund-raiser that's been held 
in Chicago for a Presbyterian hospital for 75 years. That show uses no 
professional models. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a huge success, and it's a totally amateur show," she said. "This could 
have been just as successful. You have to use the community to make it 
attractive (for people) to be in it. They should have kept it an amateur show." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said a one-year delay would give the board time to re-evaluate 
finances and the model-selection process. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of us feel it's time to do some changes," said Marlene Short, 
chairwoman of the guilds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've argued over the process," said Fiona Petersen, who served as guilds 
chairwoman for two years before Short. Pleasing "the stores is important -- 
they pay money to be in the show -- but we want the guild members to 
participate. First and foremost in our minds is, this is a guild event." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the guilds, wooing retailers to enter the show every year is a challenge. 
Not all stores feel they fit into the high-gloss, large-scale show. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't do it again," said Alison Cottrell, manager of Calvin Klein in South 
Coast Plaza. Calvin Klein participated in the show for the first time last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real inconvenience, and as far as rewards, we didn't get any," 
Cottrell said. "A lot of people who attended aren't Calvin Klein customers. 
Calvin Klein is a little more understated than what a lot of those people are 
looking for." 
</P>
<P>
 After the store paid the entry fee as well as extra staff to transport the 
clothes back and forth to the show, Cottrell said the show attracted no new 
customers to Calvin Klein. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concept behind the show is fabulous, and it's nice to contribute to the 
community, but not to get anything back was frustrating," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other retailers have found the Center of Fashion to be a positive experience. 
Mi Place in Laguna Niguel and Fullerton has participated every year, and 
co-owner Mary Rubenstein said the stores have always seen a return on their 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We rent a bus and bring people (to lunch and) to the show. My customers love 
going. We make it a whole day," Rubenstein said. "If it were just the show, it 
wouldn't be worth it. We make it work for ourselves."

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; GRACE UNDER PRESSURE; WORKERS: AS BUILDINGS 
FELL AND FEARS ROSE, THE ONES WHO PATCH US BACK TOGETHER KEPT A STEADY FOCUS ON 
THEIR JOBS. 
</P>

<P>
 In the hours after Monday's temblor, when the shaking ground had many people 
badly shaken, some were able to keep their cool. 
</P>
<P>
 A desk cop soothed worried callers. A utility worker left his battered home to 
report for work. An emergency room nurse, not knowing if his family had 
survived, remained at his post. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have the type of job where I can go screaming out the door and run 
home," said Richard Paige, who works the night shift at Northridge Hospital 
Medical Center. "I have to keep focused on what I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Operating somewhere between heroism and paralyzing fear, Paige and others 
performed their jobs, maintaining a professional front while all hell broke 
loose around them. 
</P>
<P>
 When the quake struck, Paige's first thoughts centered on his safety and that 
of his wife and two daughters at home in Valencia. But his attention quickly 
snapped back to matters at hand. The emergency room lay dark in a shambles all 
around him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew we were going to get massive amounts of people in here," he said. "I 
knew we had to get ready." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Paige's task to organize the skeleton crew of nurses on duty at that 
hour. They checked the physical condition of their building and decided to set 
up tables and chairs in the parking lot. Paige called the supply room for more 
bandages and equipment. Then he gathered the nurses to remind them of the 
disaster plan. It was not a pleasant task. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had already decided where the morgue was going to be," he said. "The 
people who were severely injured, who would require lots of help, we weren't 
going to be able to help them. We would have to put them aside and help the 
ones that could be helped." 
</P>
<P>
 And in the moments before the first injured arrived, he tried to call home. 
The lines were busy. 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles from the hospital, Ron Nielsen was surveying his Winnetka home. 
Cracks shot through walls and chunks of stucco had broken loose. Nielsen's wife 
and son were unharmed, but his daughter had spent the night at a girlfriend's 
house and he had no way of knowing if she was safe. Still, he hurried to work. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene at his Department of Water and Power yard was chaotic. Nielsen and 
his crew spent the first hour clearing debris to get at equipment and trucks. 
Once they were on the road, the enormity of their task became apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of main breaks and street separations, a lot of water 
running everywhere," he said. "On an average day, we might report to one or two 
emergency incidents. On that day, we were looking at 50 or 100." 
</P>
<P>
 They began just after sunrise, digging up broken pipes at Van Norman 
Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain people excel in stressful situations, said Mark Mallinger, a 
management professor at Pepperdine University. These types are usually serious 
about their work and take satisfaction in helping others. Disasters, Mallinger 
said, are when they shine. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Los Angeles Police Department's Devonshire Division in Northridge, most 
of the off-duty officers arrived by midmorning. Officer Roger Ruggiero manned 
the front desk, dealing with panicked callers. People wanted to know how to 
locate family members or retrieve personal items from damaged apartments. For 
Ruggiero, working the phones became more difficult as the day brought more 
aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This building is all brick and concrete," he said. "Every time it shook, we 
had a couple of guys fighting for the doorway. It was real scary." 
</P>
<P>
 The officers could not always hide their fear from callers. Nor could the 
counselors at the West Valley Mental Health Center in Van Nuys, who also 
fielded calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided that it was OK to let our clients know that we were feeling it 
too," said Ron Klein, a district chief at the center. "In some ways, it makes 
the person calling understand that you know how they are feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Mallinger said that workers who are pressed into such duty can help themselves 
while helping others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a stress-coping device," the professor said. "They can pull back from 
their own feelings and focus on a task at hand. Some people deal best with 
stress when their attention is diverted in this way." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Crisp nodded her head. "I'm one of those people. A disaster addict." 
</P>
<P>
 Crisp is an official of United Animal Nations, a sort of Red Cross for animals 
in Northern California, providing advice and manpower to animal shelters during 
disasters. When Hurricane Andrew struck South Florida, Crisp was there. Same 
with the Midwest floods. She arrived at the West Valley Animal Care and Control 
Center in Chatsworth on Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some people, pets are as important as children," she said. "They call in 
a panic." 
</P>
<P>
 Crisp offers sympathy and, more important, the wisdom of experience. She knows 
that cats usually hide close to home for several days and return unharmed. Dogs 
run, so she advises that owners check at a shelter each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Crisp has the advantage of arriving from elsewhere, working without 
concern for her own family and home. People such as Paige and Nielsen had to 
work all day before learning that their loved ones were safe. And after 
backbreaking shifts, they returned to damaged houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone else got to spend the day picking up," Nielsen said. "Those things 
were still waiting for me when I got home."

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; COUNSELING AIMS TO EASE PARENTS' MINDS; 
SCHOOLS: STAFFING LEVELS WILL BE MAINTAINED EVEN IF ENROLLMENT DROPS, OFFICIALS 
SAY. STUDENTS WILL HAVE THE SAME INSTRUCTORS -- AND LESS UPHEAVAL.

 As they whittled down the list of unsafe classrooms Sunday, Los Angeles school 
officials showed federal visitors some rubble-strewn campuses and announced 
plans to ease the "terrible trauma" of the earthquake by extending counseling 
to parents as well as to students and staff. 
</P>
<P>
 In the effort to provide some stability after last week's 6.6-magnitude 
temblor, the district will also abandon plans for midyear staff transfers at 
schools with reduced enrollment, so students will have the same instructors and 
less upheaval throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither measure is expected to cost the beleaguered Los Angeles Unified School 
District much additional money in light of a massive rebuilding tab, currently 
estimated at $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But promises of federal help in returning school life to normal in the 
nation's second-largest school district were issued Sunday by U.S. Education 
Secretary Richard Riley, after a tour of four quake-damaged campuses in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important for a community that's had a major disaster to get back into 
the daily rhythm of life as soon as possible," Riley said during a news 
conference at Kennedy High School. The Granada Hills campus, near the epicenter 
of last Monday's quake, is among the district's hardest hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schoolchildren in schools is one of the most important parts of that rhythm," 
Riley said, "and we're going to do that and make sure it's done right." 
</P>
<P>
 The visit to Kennedy came after a tour of Porter and Northridge middle schools 
in the West San Fernando Valley, and Marvin Elementary School near the closed 
portion of the Santa Monica Freeway. As Riley spoke on the high school's main 
quadrangle, fallen bricks and other debris from the condemned administration 
building lay strewn on the ground to his right. To his left, a large wall clock 
was stuck at 4:31 -- the time of the 6.6 quake last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is shocking to see the power of this," said Riley, wearing sturdy leather 
walking shoes. "Fortunately, school was not in session." 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers, administrators and support staff were scheduled to return to work 
today as part of a rush to clean and prepare most classrooms for the resumption 
of school Tuesday. As of Sunday afternoon, about 500 classrooms were still 
deemed unusable -- a modest number, officials said, considering the district's 
30,000 classrooms at 946 sites. District officials on Saturday had put the 
number of unusable classrooms at 300, and said Sunday they still hope to 
achieve that level by Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday evening, they met with school board members to determine which schools 
were safe to reopen Tuesday and how much further they could reduce the number 
of closed campuses. They are planning to issue a definitive list of working 
schools today. 
</P>
<P>
 While students at closed schools -- most of them in the hard-hit West Valley 
-- will be staying home for now, Supt. Sid Thompson and Board President Leticia 
Quezada said Sunday they were encouraged by the rapid progress of the cleanup 
effort -- from 1,500 unusable classrooms Saturday to 795 Sunday morning to 500 
by Sunday afternoon. And by Tuesday, a spokeswoman said, officials hoped that 
number would be down to 300 classrooms districtwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the numbers continue this way, I think the picture is very good," Quezada 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 To accommodate students whose schools will not quickly reopen and keep 
instruction going, Thompson said, district officials are considering morning 
and afternoon sessions, reopening schools already closed because of declining 
enrollment and altering bus routes. Transporting 33,000 students from central 
Los Angeles to the Valley, and 17,000 students from the city's east to west 
side, will be the biggest problems, he said, because of closures at the Simi 
Valley and Santa Monica freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 To deal with longer-term academic repercussions of the quake, particularly in 
hard-hit areas with closed schools, the district also is considering delaying 
final exams and extending the school year, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said dealing with the emotional trauma of the quake and getting school 
life back to normal for 640,000 students will be the first priorities of 
educators once school buildings are declared safe and operational. Counselors 
will be available to students and staff on campus, and hot lines opened for 
parents, especially those afraid to send their children back to class. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't do that kind of training for parents, it's very likely many kids 
will not return to school," Quezada said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning today, clinical social workers and senior psychologists will be 
available by telephone. Some concerns may be handled over the phone, while 
other cases may require an office visit for group or individual counseling, 
according to a district announcement Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Marleen Wong, director of the district's School Mental Health Services unit, 
said that returning young people to familiar routines such as school is one of 
the most helpful steps in recovering from a trauma like an earthquake. But she 
cautioned that fears about being separated from the family may still occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Pledging whatever additional funding may be necessary to bring normality back 
to campuses, Riley said, "I'm told that when a young person is accustomed to 
having their school open it's part of the family structure. When it's not, it's 
very difficult for them to deal with and we're going to see to it that the 
proper counseling is there." 
</P>
<P>
 Quezada said the district also has decided to abandon its usual adjustment of 
school staffing at the end of January -- transferring teachers and other 
employees from schools with dropped enrollments -- to maintain continuity for 
traumatized students. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is usually a cause of great turmoil and instability and we don't want to 
have that now." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Riley said later that the federal government will not pay 
the salaries of existing school counselors, but will reimburse expenses such as 
overtime and additional staff if such costs are incurred because of the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district has yet to estimate the cost of such disaster-related 
operational expenses -- apart from rebuilding costs to be covered by FEMA, said 
spokeswoman Camille Johnston. So far, the U.S. Education Department has 
committed $10 million, and a bill seeking additional funding is expected to be 
heard in Congress this week, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA Director James L. Witt, who accompanied Riley on his school tour Sunday, 
reiterated promises of speedy funding for rebuilding. He said teams of state 
and federal building inspectors will start writing reports on the school damage 
so they can be filed and the funding process begun immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA can also send portable classrooms within 10 days if they are necessary, 
Witt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think a lot of people realize the magnitude of this disaster," Witt 
said at the news conference. "This is a very large disaster and it's taking a 
tremendous amount of people and assets to respond to it."

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; DOLE REBUFFED ON PLAN TO OFFSET U.S. COSTS; 
RELIEF: SENATE LEADER WANTS TO CUT OTHER PROGRAMS TO PAY FOR AID. FEDERAL 
OFFICIALS BUDGET UP TO $5 BILLION IN INITIAL PACKAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials Sunday shaped a preliminary Southern 
California earthquake relief package of $4 billion to $5 billion, and rejected 
a demand by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) that Congress offset 
disaster payments by cutting other federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
 With the figures on earthquake-related damage rising rapidly, officials 
cautioned that the full cost to the Treasury could rise higher. Nonetheless, 
Administration aides plan to begin discussions with congressional leaders 
Tuesday or Wednesday on an aid package. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said several hundred million dollars of the proposed aid would be in 
the form of loans to individuals to repair homes and to businesses to fix 
damage from the earthquake. Federal law allows low-interest home repair loans 
of up to $100,000, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bulk of the federal outlay would be direct spending. The money would 
go for several purposes: funds to repair schools, highways, streets, water 
mains and other public facilities; housing vouchers to pay for temporary 
housing for those left homeless; public health expenses ranging from disease 
control to some mental health costs, and short-term disaster relief costs such 
as the shelters set up to house families. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as they try to keep up with the escalating estimates of the cost of 
repairs, aides to President Clinton have been bracing for potential opposition 
in Congress. Dole's remarks, made on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation," were the first 
sign that such opposition is beginning to surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole signaled that Republicans in both the House and Senate would advocate 
immediate reductions in federal spending to balance any emergency assistance 
for earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Some lawmakers had urged offsetting cuts during debate last year over Midwest 
flood relief, but Congress rejected the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ought to provide the relief as quickly as we can, in whatever amount it 
takes, but we ought to pay for it," Dole said. "We shouldn't add it to the 
deficit." 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials, however, said the Administration would oppose any 
requirement to make multibillion-dollar reductions in government outlays in 
order to aid quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not favor offsetting cuts for the (1993) flood relief, which helped 
Kansas, nor do we think it appropriate to change the rules that have applied to 
previous disasters in the case of the Los Angeles quake," said Christopher 
Edley, associate director of the Office of Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The clashing views came as Gov. Pete Wilson said damage estimates now exceed 
$30 billion, thus making it the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 Edley declined to estimate the total cost of the Administration's quake relief 
package. But another senior official who estimated the cost of current plans at 
$4 billion to $5 billion also rejected Dole's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The deficit is coming in way below where anyone thought it would be. We're 
not in crisis," the official said, referring to estimates showing the federal 
budget deficit has dropped from nearly $300 billion to roughly $180 billion. 
Dole's suggestion "is sort of odd," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 A $4-billion to $5-billion relief package would be roughly similar to the $4.6 
billion Washington has paid to cover aid for the seven Midwestern states hit by 
flooding last spring and summer. It would be substantially more than the 
roughly $2.5 billion that the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in Northern 
California cost the Treasury, but would be considerably below the nearly 
$8-billion cost of the three major hurricanes that hit Florida, Louisiana, 
Hawaii and Guam in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the cost to the federal government, state and local governments 
are also expecting to pay large amounts in earthquake-related costs, and 
private insurers have said they expect to pay out several billion dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 As federal and state assessment teams continued their review of the 
earthquake's impact, damage estimates have mounted rapidly. Figures for one 
major category of relief costs doubled on Friday alone, one official said, 
indicating that a final total may not be available for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration probably will propose a disaster relief bill that would 
provide several billion dollars up front with additional funds set aside in a 
reserve that could be used if needed. The Midwest flood aid bill contained a 
similar provision. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials say the disaster cost estimates have been rising rapidly in 
part because of additional damage to buildings caused by aftershocks but also 
because engineers are finding new problems as they continue their assessments. 
</P>

 The costs of a downed freeway interchange, for example, can be estimated 
rapidly, but "it takes time for engineers to walk, use ultrasound scanners and 
look for hidden stresses," Edley said. There could well be "need for more 
demolition and reconstruction of highways than now seems likely," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government will pick up 90% of the cost of repairs to interstate 
highways. Clinton is also likely to grant a request from Wilson for the federal 
government to pick up 90%, rather than 75%, of the cost of repairing other 
public facilities, such as schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, money for such uses has been classified as a budget "emergency" 
by both the President and Congress, thus exempting it from the pay-as-you-go 
provisions of the budget law. Without such a designation, every dollar of 
disaster payments would have to be offset by another dollar of reduced spending 
or tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Dole declared his intentions to seek the pay-as-you-go treatment for 
California earthquake aid, however, he acknowledged that he might not prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have a plan to pay for it," he said. "If it loses, it loses. . 
. . We'll see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 But, underscoring the political difficulty in finding budget cuts that will 
get majority backing in both the House and Senate, Dole said there is as yet no 
agreement among Republicans on how to make the spending reductions that would 
be required to offset the quake aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "The budget's going to be very tight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic leaders have issued similar warnings, noting that Congress approved 
a hard freeze on spending for most domestic programs for five years as part of 
Clinton's economic program, which was enacted in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But there have been increasing demands by lawmakers for some method of 
financing the cost of disaster relief without adding to the massive federal 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of deficit-conscious Democrats and a solid bloc of Republicans raised 
the issue last summer, temporarily delaying congressional approval of federal 
relief for victims of the Midwest floods. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, Clinton, following the example of his Republican predecessor, 
George Bush, asked Congress to waive the pay-as-you-go budget rules in 
approving flood relief. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the bill's progress was stalled in the House when a 216-205 vote 
rejected the first attempt to bring up the measure without offsetting budget 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we keep on doing what we always did, we will always get what we always got 
-- a $4.3-trillion deficit," said Rep. Jim Nussle (R-Iowa), who supported the 
pay-as-you-go move in that debate. 
</P>
<P>
 But House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) responded: "When we have 
unforeseen emergencies and circumstances that demand immediate action, we do 
not stop everything and go through a budget process." 
</P>
<P>
 Congress eventually passed the flood-relief bill without any offsetting cuts 
in spending, but, bowing to pressure from members of his own party, House 
Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) agreed to set up a bipartisan task force to 
consider ways to pay for future disaster relief costs.

DAMAGE ESTIMATES DOUBLE AS TRANSIT WORK PROGRESSES 
</P>

 City officials nearly doubled their estimates of earthquake damage to local 
homes, businesses and public buildings as Caltrans engineers dynamited a ruined 
Golden State Freeway overpass and workers put finishing touches on hastily 
built Metrolink stations in Palmdale and Lancaster Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena thanked workers who erected a pair 
of Metrolink stations in just four days in anticipation of a crush of commuters 
headed south into Los Angeles this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to congratulate you for doing such a great job and doing it so 
quickly," Pena told construction workers, who were still toiling late Sunday. 
"It's incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Clarita, city officials raised their estimates of the damage to $222 
million. But they added that residents seemed to be coping well as they settled 
into a routine of post-quake disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think things are going well," said Ken Pulskamp, Santa Clarita's assistant 
city manager. "We've kind of passed through a lot of the critical things. 
People have water. The utilities have been turned on. Now, at least people are 
getting settled into some kind of routine." 
</P>
<P>
 In their latest assessment, city officials added $39 million worth of damage 
to various private buildings and about $50 million to the California Institute 
of the Arts, a private college. That brought the number of private buildings 
damaged in the city to nearly 1,100. 
</P>
<P>
 City spokeswoman Gail Foy estimated that more than half of the area's nearly 
3,000 mobile homes were knocked off their pads by last Monday's temblor, 
cutting them off from utilities. Thirty teams of building inspectors are 
assessing the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday evening, firefighters evacuated about 10 homes in a Santa Clarita 
neighborhood after workers accidentally broke a high-pressure gas line. There 
were no injuries or fire in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials expect to begin reopening City Hall on Valencia Boulevard this 
morning. Crews worked through the weekend to repair its estimated $2 million 
worth of damage. But the city's emergency center will remain in tents and 
trailers in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 In Palmdale and Lancaster, crews have been working 18-hour days and more to 
construct the two temporary Metrolink stations. The cities have spent more than 
$300,000 on the platforms and hope that the federal government will reimburse 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink ridership has surged since the quake, with Antelope Valley commuters 
last week having to catch the train at the Santa Clarita station. More than 
6,000 people rode Metrolink from the station Friday morning, surging from a 
pre-quake average of 500. 
</P>
<P>
 Just after 5 p.m., Caltrans crews used about 400 pounds of explosives to 
demolish a damaged section of the northbound Golden State Freeway at Gavin 
Canyon where the freeway crosses over the Old Road, part of the work necessary 
to open a freeway bypass by the end of this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans engineer Jay Steele said the massive explosion dropped about 1,500 
tons of concrete debris onto a 15-foot-high mound of dirt that had been trucked 
in to cushion the roadway and underground utilities. Workers hope to break up 
the debris and truck it away by late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The blast was intended to clear the damaged freeway overpass over the Old Road 
so that roadway can serve as a bypass for the damaged freeway between Calgrove 
Boulevard and the Weldon Canyon truck inspection station. The demolition and 
paving work are expected to cost about $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, relief officials reported that five shelters throughout the Santa 
Clarita Valley, where about 590 people stayed Saturday night, are getting 
adequate supplies of food and water, with donations and volunteers coming from 
around the country. That number was down by about 60 people from the night 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said most electricity had been restored to homes in the valley, but 
about 30% of residents still were without natural gas. Most areas also had 
water service, except for several thousand Valencia Water Co. customers. 
However, valley residents still were being advised to boil tap water before 
drinking it. 
</P>
<P>
 The city continued to operate a group of water distribution centers, 11 
locations offering bottled water and nine with water tankers. The stock 
included at least 18 truckloads of Miller beer bottles filled with water that 
the brewing company donated to the relief effort.

HOMETOWN MEMORIES; ONCE A NICE QUIET PLACE, NORTHRIDGE IS THRUST OUT OF ITS 
OBSCURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN RODERICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is a strange feeling to have your hometown suddenly become known around the 
world after a lifetime of undeserved obscurity. 
</P>
<P>
 By my reckoning, Northridge has been famous only twice before. In 1969 the 
most raucous rock concert ever held in Los Angeles raged for three long days 
and nights at Devonshire Downs, the old horse racing track and fairgrounds. It 
was a lot more fun than the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Some years later, comedian Richard Pryor burned his face in an accident at his 
gated estate, a block and a half from the more modest house where I grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't live there anymore, but driving around to survey the earthquake damage 
reminded me that Northridge has always been underrated. It was a pretty fair 
place for a boy to grow up in the 1950s and '60s, a semirural gem that was 
never just another faceless Valley subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
 There were hidden creeks for catching tadpoles, an abundance of pomegranates 
and oranges for a furtive snack in someone's back yard, and lots of horses. We 
had tall, elegant old walnut trees in our yard, relics of the orchards that 
replaced wheat as the crop of choice. 
</P>
<P>
 It never felt like the city or even a real suburb. At various times we had a 
horse, a cow, a peacock, a parrot, a toad and possums show up in our yard. My 
dad still traps possums every so often and calls Animal Regulation to come get 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge had its own parade and rodeo, the Stampede, every year. The fair at 
Devonshire Downs each summer was the place for neighborhood kids to show off 
their prize rabbits and ewes. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge was also a Hollywood colony for those who liked horses or just 
enjoyed being out of town. Barbara Stanwyck, Jack Oakie and Betty Grable lived 
in Northridge. Montie Montana, the cowboy star, rode in the Stampede and was 
the honorary mayor for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents there had enough clout to ensure good schools and to get Willie Mays 
and Don Drysdale to come to the opening of Little League season one year. New 
subdivisions and sewers were constantly under construction, so there were 
always bulldozers to climb on and scrap lumber for treehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge was different for a reason, I came to believe. Long before it fell 
into line as a suburb of imperial Los Angeles, it was a real place. It had a 
main street -- now Reseda Boulevard -- a train depot on the Southern Pacific 
coast line, and a different name: Zelzah (and, for a time, North Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A few days after the quake, I picked up my brother, Peter, and we went to 
check out the old sights. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of Plummer Hill, a piece of high ground shaded by eucalyptus trees and 
cooled by a small creek probably known only to neighborhood kids, an old adobe 
house of mysterious origin was still standing. 
</P>
<P>
 The aging houses also looked all right in my favorite old Northridge 
neighborhood, an area of dirt streets and overgrown pepper trees that began as 
a subdivision of chicken ranches in the 1920s. There were some broken windows 
but the old houses looked like they had held their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Not two blocks away, modern apartment buildings across the street from Cal 
State Northridge had collapsed on each other. 
</P>
<P>
 In our old neighborhood, which has somehow come to be called Sherwood Forest 
by the real estate agents, the house where my parents still live got thoroughly 
shaken. They lost a toilet, some other plumbing and their quota of valuable 
glassware. But their chimney held. 
</P>
<P>
 A few blocks away, where the homes are bigger and newer and worth more, it 
seemed as if the chimneys had fallen off every fourth house. 
</P>
<P>
 Yards are huge in this area, sometimes close to an acre, and typically hidden 
behind screens of trees or -- more commonly as the Valley became inundated with 
cars -- block walls. Now, for the first time since I was young and willing to 
sneak over fences, I could see in many of those yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The wall was down in front of where Jim Davis had lived, and I could see that 
the house that fascinated my friends and me as 10-year-olds was actually pretty 
basic. Jim was an old Western character actor who didn't become a household 
name until he starred as the oil patriarch Jock Ewing on TV's "Dallas." 
</P>
<P>
 As kids we knew Jim as the gruff but daring Wes Cameron on "Rescue 8," one of 
the first shows, if not the first, to glamorize rescue squads and paramedics. 
One birthday I asked for (and got) a coil of rope because of my absorption with 
his rescue exploits. 
</P>
<P>
 Many walls had also fallen around the two dozen homes built on what used to be 
actor Walter Brennan's estate. Some of the walls had just laid down, their 
masonry intact, so they now looked like brick sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of old downtown Northridge was gone long before this quake. When we were 
kids, the train station still stood at the intersection of Reseda Boulevard and 
Parthenia Street. Nearby was Brown's feed store, which had a wooden boardwalk 
in front and a wonderful smell of hay and saddle leather. 
</P>
<P>
 The ghosts of both old landmarks were buried under a new train overpass built 
in the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 We did find the old Norwegian Lutheran church, which was built in 1917. It is 
part of a Japanese Free Methodist church now on Gresham Street, and its white 
shiplap looked sound. With its steep stairs and narrow girth, it looks like a 
church you'd find sitting all alone on the Kansas plains. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the places I wanted to inspect was Northridge Skateland, my proving 
ground as a teen-ager. I held my first job -- and first flirted with girls -- 
at the old roller rink. I also spent many Friday nights there dancing to a 
young Tina Turner (still with husband Ike at the time) and rock bands such as 
Iron Butterfly and the Standells. 
</P>
<P>
 The rink's dual life as a dance hall ended when its curmudgeonly owner, Roy 
Bannister, quit the business. Dave and Mike Fleming, whose father bought the 
place in 1968 and kicked out us riffraff, were there last week overseeing 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceiling had fallen down and what used to be the back wall was open to the 
elements. The damage was not as bad as it looked, said Dave Fleming. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was built (in 1956) as a warehouse . . . in case the roller rink didn't 
work out," he said. The gape in the wall was where the loading doors had been. 
They planned to reopen the rink this Friday with a benefit skating session to 
raise money for Red Cross quake relief efforts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not as lucky were a number of old stone houses at Rancho Cordillera del Norte 
on Wilbur Avenue. At least one of the rock houses was in shambles and others 
appeared severely damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The new Northridge has none of the charm of the old. Built mostly on land I 
remember as orange groves and pasture on the far fringes of town, it is mile 
after mile of walled enclaves with names such as Running Springs, Devonshire 
Country Estates, Ridge Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 At least, they were behind walls until last Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 At Devonshire Downs, there was nothing left to be damaged. The exhibit halls 
where 4-H kids competed for ribbons and the horse corrals are long gone, the 
property now an adjunct to Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The last orchard of any size is a token seven acres of oranges at CSUN. Even 
our Little League field is gone, covered by a tract of homes where some of the 
families spent last week living in the driveway in their RVs. 
</P>
<P>
 But I was relieved to find that at least some of the Northridge that I 
remember survives, enough that it still feels like home. 
</P>
<P>
 My old hometown may never again be totally obscure, but that's not such a bad 
thing. Sometimes it's nice when everybody knows your name.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; SANTA CLARITA DAMAGE ESTIMATE DOUBLES; 
RECONSTRUCTION: QUAKE TOLL IS PUT AT $222 MILLION. CALTRANS DYNAMITES A WRECKED 
INTERSTATE 5 OVERPASS, AND TWO NEW METROLINK STATIONS ARE RAPIDLY BUILT. 
</P>

 Santa Clarita officials on Sunday nearly doubled estimates of earthquake 
damage to structures in the city as Caltrans engineers dynamited a ruined 
Golden State Freeway overpass nearby and workers put finishing touches on two 
hastily built Metrolink stations in Palmdale and Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Antelope Valley, U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena thanked 
workers who erected a pair of Metrolink stations in just four days in 
anticipation of a crush of commuters headed south into Los Angeles this 
morning.  
</P>
<P>
 "I want to congratulate you for doing such a great job and doing it so 
quickly," Pena told construction workers, who were still toiling late Sunday. 
"It's incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita city officials on Sunday revised their estimate of damage to 
homes, businesses and public buildings in their city at $222 million. But they 
added that residents seem to be coping well as they settle into a post-quake 
routine of disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think things are going well. We've kind of passed through a lot of the 
critical things. People have water. The utilities have been turned on. Now, at 
least people are getting settled into some kind of routine," said Ken Pulskamp, 
Santa Clarita's assistant city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 In their latest assessment, city officials added $89 million worth of damage 
to various private structures, $50 million of it to Cal Arts, a private 
college. That brought to nearly 1,100 the number of private buildings damaged 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Gail Foy, a city spokeswoman, estimated that more than half of the area's 
nearly 3,000 mobile homes also were knocked off their pads by last Monday's 
Northridge-centered temblor, cutting them off from utilities. Thirty teams of 
building inspectors are assessing the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials, meanwhile, expect this morning to begin reopening City Hall on 
Valencia Boulevard. Crews worked through the weekend to begin repairing its 
estimated $2 million worth of damage. But the city's emergency center will 
remain in tents and trailers in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 In Palmdale and Lancaster, crews have been working 18-hour days to construct 
two temporary train stations. The cities have spent more than $300,000 on the 
platforms and are hoping the federal government will reimburse them. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink use has surged since the earthquake, with Antelope Valley commuters 
last week having to catch the train at the nearest station in Santa Clarita. 
More than 6,000 people rode Metrolink from the Santa Clarita station Friday 
morning, up from a pre-quake average of only 500. 
</P>
<P>
 At the federal disaster assistance center in Canyon Country, officials 
accepted relief applications from more than 400 people on Sunday and more than 
1,700 had appointments booked through the end of this week, as the growing 
operation spilled from a park building into the outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 Just after 5 p.m. Sunday, Caltrans crews demolished a damaged section of the 
northbound Golden State Freeway at Gavin Canyon, part of the work necessary to 
open a freeway bypass by the end of this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief officials reported that five shelters in the Santa Clarita area housed 
about 590 people Saturday night -- down by about 60 people from the night 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said most electricity had been restored, but about 30% of 
residents still were without natural gas. Most areas also had water service, 
except for several thousand Valencia Water Co. customers.

 They came with the best of intentions, bearing four television sets and 
pancake breakfasts for 1,000, hoping to help the victims of last Monday's 
earthquake take their minds off their misery. 
</P>
<P>
 But it became immediately clear that the dozens of volunteers who descended on 
the American Red Cross shelter in San Fernando on Sunday calculated the 
appetites of the evacuees better than their craving for entertainment. The 
volunteers, from the Hyatt Hotels and Resorts, tuned the four television sets 
to National Football League playoffs, but a Mexican soccer game, some 
Raiderettes and the appearance of a Catholic priest proved to be bigger 
attractions than the Kansas City-Buffalo game. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers, who provided food for hundreds of residents as well as the 
more than 500 people staying in the shelter, thought football would be a 
welcome diversion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sunday is such a family day, such a football day," said Lisa Haller, one of 
the Hyatt employees who organized the event at the shelter at San Fernando 
Recreation Park. "We tried to bring home out here as much as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 But as the earthquake victims clustered on cots in the gymnasium and under a 
giant tent outside, enjoying the hearty meal of scrambled eggs, home fries, 
bacon and pancakes, only a handful paid any attention to the television sets. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the gymnasium, about a dozen men changed the channel on one of the sets 
so they could watch two Mexican soccer teams face off. Sitting on a metal 
folding chair in front of the screen, Joaquin Moreno explained that the game, 
between rival Mexican teams, was more exciting for Mexicans than the NFL 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a Super Bowl for us in Mexico," said Moreno, whose mobile home in 
Sylmar was flattened by the quake. "It's like a classic." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the children staying at the shelter passed time playing in the park 
playground or talking with their families as they sat on cots inside, or on 
grassy areas under gray skies. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in black-and-white Raiders jackets and carrying silver pompons, a trio 
of Raiderettes offered another distraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know you are somebody even though they don't know who you are," said 
Raiderette Kelly Morris of Whittier before pausing to sign an autograph for a 
young boy. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither the Mexican soccer game nor the Raiderettes came close to the 
power of attraction that Catholic priest Gerrit Crawford demonstrated when he 
arrived at the park at midmorning, dressed in white robes and carrying a silver 
bowl of communion wafers. 
</P>
<P>
 A medical missionary from St. Jude Health Center in San Bernardino, Crawford 
visited the shelter as one of many stops on a tour of the San Fernando Valley 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to keep going until the sacrament runs out," Crawford said, 
adding that he had enough for about 1,200 people. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 people dropped their conversations or put down their plates and 
swarmed around Crawford, who tied a tapestry of the Virgin Mary around a tree 
trunk and began a five-minute service from behind a makeshift altar made of a 
folding table draped with a white cloth. As he recited the Lord's Prayer, a 
hush came over the park, with only the thumping of a military helicopter 
overhead and the occasional cry of a small child to interrupt it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very beautiful," said Edward Sierra, a shelter resident who lost all 
of his possessions when the quake hit the home he rented in San Fernando. "It 
helps people's souls so they won't be afraid anymore."

BAR QUAKE AID TO NON-CITIZENS, LAWMAKER SAYS

 Illegal immigrants who suffered losses in the Northridge earthquake should not 
receive federal relief funds, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher says. 
</P>
<P>
 An outspoken critic of illegal immigration, the Huntington Beach Republican 
said Saturday that he plans to introduce legislation that would require 
disaster victims to show proof of legal residency before receiving funds from 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the people of California to understand that hundreds of millions of 
dollars that should be going to them as citizens and legal residents are 
instead going to illegal aliens, and it's absolutely outrageous," said 
Rohrabacher, who believes that federal policies encourage illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once people realize that there is free money available, the line will be 
never-ending and will reach all the way to the border," the three-term 
congressman said. 
</P>
<P>
 An immigrant rights activist called Rohrabacher's comments racist, accusing 
him of trying to further his political career on the backs of undocumented 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think that there was anyone that cruel," said Arturo Montes, state 
director of urban affairs for the League of United Latin American Citizens. 
"This is a situation where someone is drowning, and he wants to say: 'Show me 
some ID before I rescue you,' " Montes said. "This is racist, and it's worse 
than those people selling a loaf of bread for $10," Montes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrabacher said he was aware that his comments would draw criticism, but that 
he believes that federal funds should go only to legal citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is that there are limited amounts of emergency funds in the 
country," Rohrabacher said. "I'm not kicking anybody when they are up or down. 
I'm saying we have to use our hearts, but we have to use our heads."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; SOME VENUES CRIPPLED BY DAMAGE; ENTERTAINMENT: 
HARDEST HIT ARE EL PORTAL AND AMERICAN RENEGADE THEATRE COMPLEX IN NORTH 
HOLLYWOOD. THE MUSIC SCENE SUFFERED LESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD and ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Entertainment venues for live music and theater in the San Fernando Valley 
were among the victims of Monday's 6.6-magnitude earthquake, damaging buildings 
and closing some clubs and stages for several days. 
</P>
<P>
 While many have reopened, some suffered crippling blows. Hardest hit was the 
Valley's theater community, with major damage to the venerable El Portal, which 
recently became home of the Actors Alley troupe, and the American Renegade 
Theatre complex. Both are in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The local music scene suffered less. The most prominent Valley venue, the 
Universal Amphitheater, was left virtually untouched and most of the clubs 
remained intact. 
</P>
<P>
 But club owners voiced some concern over the possible loss of audiences, too 
preoccupied with damages at home to venture back out at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm scared to death of what the future holds," said Dale Jaffe, co-owner of 
Le Cafe in Sherman Oaks. "There's condemned buildings all around us. There's 
people without homes. I really wonder if we're going to have the customers we 
need to support our business in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the theaters damaged by the quake were: 
</P>
<P>
 Actors Alley at the El Portal Theatre. A significant portion of the theater 
and lobby ceilings fell, but initial reports indicated that the Lankershim 
Boulevard facility was structurally sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "The building needs a lot of work now," said Marty Cooper, spokesman for 
Actors Alley. "But it's definitely not a loss, and no consideration is being 
given to just walking away from it all." 
</P>
<P>
 The roof of the theater was apparently undamaged, as was the troupe's "arena 
theater" space built inside the larger hall and an adjacent storefront 
performance space. 
</P>
<P>
 Actors Alley, which leases the building, was weeks away from opening the first 
productions in its new home after months of restoration and redesign. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the company is faced with finding a new venue for its two upcoming 
productions of Peter Lefcourt's "The Audit" and James Thurber's "The Male 
Animal." 
</P>
<P>
 American Renegade Theatre. The exterior veranda of this Spanish-style 
structure, built in 1902, partially collapsed. The multi-theater complex on 
Magnolia Boulevard also sustained large cracks in the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-artistic director David Cox estimated repair costs as high as $100,000. 
"But our immediate concern is that the roof doesn't cave in," Cox said. "We 
will certainly have to remove all the tile from the roof." 
</P>
<P>
 The adjoining building at the site, built in the 1920s, separated a few inches 
from the main theater building. The company's smaller rear theater space was 
undamaged. 
</P>
<P>
 American Renegade's production of Mike Reynolds' "Knockin' 'Em Dead" is being 
transferred to the West End Playhouse, where it will open Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Art of the Dance. The North Hollywood performance space sustained water damage 
from a broken water heater. Carpets had to removed, dried and reinstalled by 
facility staff. Ceiling tiles also fell, but dance classes were expected to 
resume soon. 
</P>
<P>
 California Cottage Theatre. The theater, located in the Van Nuys home of Roy 
and Adele Brocksmith, was structurally undamaged, although props and glass 
items were damaged or demolished. Roy Brocksmith said that the only physical 
harm he suffered was from four volumes of Shakespeare that fell on him from a 
bookshelf while he was in bed. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Connection Comedy Theatre. Although the Ventura Boulevard theater -- 
located in the heart of severely damaged Sherman Oaks -- appeared to have no 
structural damage, an assessment is still pending. The theater's storefront 
windows were shattered during the quake. Performances were expected to resume 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster Performing Arts Center. The only damage suffered at the large 
theater center was to the mechanisms that carry the weight of the stage 
curtains. The damage occurred during a Monday afternoon aftershock, and repairs 
were quickly made. 
</P>
<P>
 NoHo Studio. Corners of the North Hollywood performance complex were cracked, 
but structural engineers have declared the brick building sound. The damage was 
superficial, according to studio operator Dan Hirsch, who noted that if the 
building had not been seismically retrofitted, "it might have come down like a 
house of cards." 
</P>
<P>
 While repairs take place, the Artists Confronting AIDS production of "The 
Desired Effect," scheduled to open at the studio this weekend, will reopen Jan. 
30 at the undamaged Limelight Theater in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 A Noise Within. The only visible damage in the company's home, the Glendale 
Masonic Temple, were chunks of plaster that fell in the lobby and stairwell 
areas. A complete building inspection will be made early in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Victory Theatre. A temporary structure housing the Burbank theater's dressing 
room collapsed, but the concrete-and-steel theater building was undamaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Music venues hit by the earthquake include: 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge Music Department. Because the school has been sealed 
since Monday, the staff remains unclear about the full extent of damage to 
campus music venues. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, several music events will have to be rescheduled. Among those was 
a planned concert by the CSUN Symphony with singer-actress Nichelle Nichols, 
which will probably be pushed back at least two weeks from its original 
mid-February date. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to do what we have to do, whether that means putting up huts on 
the ball field or getting tents for rehearsal space," said David Aks, music 
director for the symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 The Classroom. This live blues club near the quake's epicenter in Northridge 
suffered no structural damage, but did lose its water heater, toilets, ice 
machine, stools and more than $10,000 in liquor stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The club has reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 The Country Club. Damages to the Reseda club included cracked walls, broken 
glass and damaged sound equipment and computers. "I know that roof is going to 
need some work," said owner Tony Longval. "I've got light coming in." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he hopes that repairs will be completed in time for a scheduled rock 
concert Feb. 19 with Reverend Horton Heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Le Cafe. A ruined wine cellar, superficial wall damage and the loss of the 
glassware and china adds up to about $20,000 in damages, one of the owners 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The club has reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baked Potato. The venerable Valley jazz club in Sherman Oaks lost about 
half its glassware, but reopened two days after the earthquake to good 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess everybody's been in the house too much," said manager Justin Randi. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Saloon. This North Hollywood venue for blues and rockabilly lost little 
more than "a couple of beer bottles," said bartender Carlos Alvarado. The club 
was reopened a day after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Caballo Loco. This banda club in Canoga Park had only been open a week, at the 
former location of the Longhorn Saloon country music venue, when the quake hit. 
Suffering only broken glass and bottles, it reopened Friday night.

INJURED DRIVER OF CAR IN CRASH TO FACE MANSLAUGHTER CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 27-year-old man whose car crossed a divider line and killed a 75-year-old 
Van Nuys man will be charged with manslaughter when he recovers from his 
injuries, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Manual Placentia of West Hills was driving east on Victory Boulevard near 
Encino Avenue about 5:30 p.m. Saturday when he crossed the yellow divider and 
slammed into a car driven by Harold Hartung, a Van Nuys retiree. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartung was pronounced dead at the scene, said Officer Jim Johnson of the Los 
Angeles Police Department's Valley Traffic Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Placentia, who suffered severe head and neck injuries in the collision, was 
booked on a vehicular-manslaughter charge and was expected to be transferred 
from UCLA Medical Center to the jail ward of the Los Angeles County General 
Hospital late Sunday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a police report, Placentia exhibited signs of heavy alcohol 
consumption at the scene of the crash, and police are awaiting the results of a 
blood-alcohol test.

<P>
 Dallas by 35. HALFTIME ENTERTAINMENT

</P>
<P>
 For other enjoyable programming next Sunday on CBS, ABC and ESPN, please 
consult your local listings. COACHES 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo -- Marv Levy, a nice man who must have done some tremendously awful 
things in a previous life. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas -- Jimmy Johnson, who boldly predicted his Cowboys would whip San 
Francisco's butt, did just that and has nothing to say about Buffalo because, 
well, Marv Levy is a nice man. QUARTERBACKS 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo -- Jim Kelly. Like Joe Namath, he predicted the outcome of a Super 
Bowl when he spotted a TV camera near the end of Sunday's AFC title game, held 
up four fingers and shouted, "We're b-a-a-a-a-ck!" 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas -- Troy Aikman. Unlike Kelly, he is undefeated in Super Bowls, which is 
why he gets invited to throw footballs into open taxi cab windows on Letterman 
and can now wallpaper his house with $100 bills. RUNNING BACKS 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo -- Thurman Thomas. Forgot to hang onto his helmet in Super Bowl XXVI. 
Forgot to hang onto the football in Super Bowl XXVIII. Would probably do 
himself a favor by forgetting to show up for Super Bowl XXVIII. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas -- Emmitt Smith. Scored two touchdowns in Sunday's NFC title game with 
a separated right shoulder, which means he'll probably have to hold the Super 
Bowl MVP trophy with his left arm. WIDE RECEIVERS 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo -- Don Beebe. In last year's Super Bowl, he caught two passes for 50 
yards and Dallas defensive tackle Leon Lett on the two-yard line, forcing a 
fumble that prevented the Cowboys from scoring an eighth touchdown, the 
highlight for the Bills in last year's Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas -- Michael Irvin. Now starring in a TV commercial with (Downtown) Julie 
Brown, where he gets to show off his big car and his big house. After Sunday, 
he can film another, in which he gets to show off his bigger car and his bigger 
house. DEFENSIVE STARS 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo -- Bruce Smith, currently appearing in two TV commercials in which he 
gets Cliff from "Cheers" to put on a dress and Dennis Hopper to smell his shoes 
-- without uttering a single word. Is also appearing in his fourth consecutive 
Super Bowl. Hopper can tell you what happened in the first three. "Bad things, 
man." 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas -- Leon Lett, who became a media recluse after mistaking a blocked 
field goal for a live ball, touching it and turning it into a live ball and 
setting up Miami for a game-winning field goal on Thanksgiving Day. Much ado 
about nothing, as it develops, as Miami can tell you. HOW THEY GOT HERE 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo -- Miami didn't win another game after Thanksgiving. Pittsburgh lost 
Barry Foster before the playoffs. Denver traveled to L.A. for a wild-card game, 
forgot to pack its defense. Buddy Ryan, hired by Houston after the Oilers went 
winless in last year's playoffs, went winless in this year's playoffs. The 
Raiders came to Rich Stadium and froze. Kansas City came to Rich Stadium and 
Joe Montana bumped his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas -- Signed Aikman and Smith to lucrative long-term contracts in 
midseason. HISTORICAL IMPLICATIONS 
</P>
<P>
 1. Before Buffalo, no team had appeared in four consecutive Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Before Buffalo, no team had lost four consecutive Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Before Buffalo, no team had lost three consecutive Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 4. No team that has ever lost a Super Bowl by 35 points has come back the next 
year to win it. 
</P>
<P>
 5. No team has ever lost back-to-back Super Bowls to the same opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 6. No team has ever lost to Buffalo in a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 7. On the bright side, the Bills have some sympathizers. The Lakers went 0-8 
against Boston in the NBA finals before finally winning in 1985. The Brooklyn 
Dodgers went 0-5 against the New York Yankees in the World Series before 
finally winning in 1955. The Boston Bruins have never beaten Montreal in the 
Stanley Cup finals, going 0-6. And the Washington Generals lost, literally, 
thousands of games to the Harlem Globetrotters. PREDICTIONS 
</P>
<P>
 1. Dallas, 52-17. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Dallas, 63-7 (incomplete). Levy pulls his team from the field with 13 
minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Bad things, man.

MORENO DOESN'T LET PAIN KEEP HER DOWN; SOCCER: DESPITE NUMEROUS INJURIES, EL 
MODENA GOALKEEPER HAS CONTINUED TO PLAY WELL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Playing with pain is an occasional necessity for most athletes, but El Modena 
goalkeeper Amy Moreno might have set a standard last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno's injury report: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Left leg: partially torn ankle ligaments, strained Achilles' tendon, pulled 
calf muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Right leg: pulled hamstring, pulled quadriceps. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Back: bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a mess," Moreno said. "Every part of my body seemed like it was 
injured. My trainer said I should invest in tape." 
</P>
<P>
 Desiree Baker, the trainer, said most would have been sidelined by the injury 
to either the hamstring or the quadriceps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she had the record," said Baker, a senior in the athletic training 
program at Chapman University. "I would see her in the training room with six 
or seven bags of ice on different parts of her body. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was incredible that she could play with those injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Moreno always passed the tests Baker put her through before clearing her 
to play; although Moreno could barely walk away from the field, she wasn't 
limping when she jogged to the goal for each of the Vanguards' Southern Section 
playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not once did we hear a moan or a complaint," El Modena Coach Tino Ray Younger 
said. "She just said, 'Tape me up. I'm going in.' 
</P>
<P>
 "She's the toughest girl athlete that I've ever seen in terms of pain 
tolerance." 
</P>
<P>
 After the games, Moreno's legs went into shutdown mode. She would spend the 
next day in bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "My teachers were pretty cool about it because we were in the playoffs," 
Moreno said. "They always knew I wouldn't be there the day after a game because 
I could barely walk." 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Moreno is in much better shape, although she had some anxious 
moments in the fall. In August, she injured her knee at a goalkeepers camp, and 
in late September, she aggravated the injury playing in a club game. But with 
acupuncture therapy and diligent rehabilitation the knee now is fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Or so Moreno says. She's been known to fib about how badly she's injured. "If 
she had broken her leg, she would try to play on it -- that's how she is," 
Baker said. "She's very stubborn." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno brushes off such talk. Sure, she feels the pain of her injuries, but to 
her it is more excruciating to stand idly on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 It's this type of determination that the Vanguards have come to expect from 
Moreno, who is in her fourth year as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's put her life and blood and guts into the team for the past three years, 
and it's nice that her goals seem to be finally coming to fruition," Younger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Halfway through the Century League season, El Modena (14-4, 5-0 in league) is 
in first place and closing in on its first league title in girls' soccer. 
Moreno has allowed 12 goals in 17 games for the Vanguards -- one more than she 
allowed in 23 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Vanguards, who are ranked No. 4 in Orange County and No. 2 in the 
Southern Section Division II, have a tougher schedule this season -- two-thirds 
of the goals (eight) have come against No. 1 Marina, No. 2 Edison, No. 3 
Capistrano Valley and No. 9 El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the defense in front of Moreno is inexperienced, only junior Erin 
Warren and sophomore Laurie Zemke were starters last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But expect no excuses from Moreno, who fumes when a ball gets past her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes she's too critical of herself," Younger said. "She puts too much 
pressure on herself to make every save. I've told her for three years, 'The 
ball has to come through 10 other people before it gets to you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 When it does get through, however, Moreno is usually in position to turn the 
other team away, a fact that has attracted attention from college coaches at 
UCLA, USC, UC Davis and Pepperdine, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 In December at the Foothill Excalibur tournament, one of the strongest high 
school tournaments in Southern California, she was the only goalkeeper on the 
all-tournament team. She was especially steady in penalty kick shootouts, the 
way ties were settled. Moreno stopped four of eight penalty kicks as the 
Vanguards beat West Hills Chaminade and Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her hobbled condition last season in the playoffs, she made 
spectacular saves that kept the Vanguards close in a 2-1 overtime victory over 
La Habra in the first round and a 1-0 victory over Alta Loma in the second. 
Arcadia, the eventual champion, then beat El Modena, 2-0, in a quarterfinal, 
but not before Moreno was moved to forward to try to spark the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's always making the saves to keep us in it and give us the chance to 
win," Younger said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Moreno joined the team as a freshman, Younger didn't have such high 
expectations. She had been a forward for her club team, but the Vanguards 
needed a goalkeeper. Moreno remembers her first tryout: "Tino basically lined a 
bunch of people up and said, 'Catch.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno won the starting position, and Younger says he remembers thinking that 
she would do a more than adequate job. An injury forced her to sit out El 
Modena's first game, an 8-0 loss. The rest of the season, Moreno allowed 18 
goals in 21 games and recorded 10 shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, she has started every game of significance, making saves that 
leave her coaches shaking their heads. For instance, last season with El Modena 
trailing, 1-0, against La Habra in the playoffs, La Habra's Amber Duarte took a 
hard shot from about 18 yards that seemed certain to find the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's raining, absolutely soaking wet," Younger said. "It would have been a 
good play just to knock it over the goal. How she holds onto it I have no idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "She does these things and on the sideline we always look at each other and 
say, "Are you kidding me, right now?' "

RECRUITING / JEFF FELLENZER: PEARSALL'S DEFENSIVE SKILLS DRAWING ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FELLENZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Grant Pearsall doesn't have great speed. He can't jump very high. And by most 
college football standards, at 6 feet 1 and 190 pounds, he isn't very big. 
</P>
<P>
 So, exactly why is Pearsall, a first-team Times Orange County selection from 
Villa Park High, one of the most heavily recruited defensive backs in Southern 
California? And why were head coaches Terry Donahue (UCLA), John Robinson (USC) 
and Rich Brooks (Oregon) in his living room at various times last week? 
</P>
<P>
 First, let him try to explain. 
</P>
<P>
 "College coaches tell me they need someone who's like a quarterback on the 
field, someone who can call the defensive signals," says Pearsall, who excelled 
as a tailback for the Spartans last season and also split time between strong 
and free safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not always size and speed that count the most." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite rushing for 1,232 yards (6.1 yards per carry) and scoring 19 
touchdowns as a senior at Villa Park, Pearsall leaves little doubt which 
platoon he prefers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Defense has always been my favorite," he says. "You get to be a little more 
wild, a little crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably my favorite thing about the game is to come up and make the big 
hit." 
</P>
<P>
 College scouts and recruiters have noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's aggressive, tough and does a lot of things well," says Dick Lascola, 
head of the Fallbrook, Calif.-based Scouting Evaluation Assn., which provides 
videotape and scouting reports on high school and community college football 
players for nearly 100 colleges across the country. "He really makes things 
happen out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Said a Pac-10 defensive coordinator: "Grant Pearsall is a terrific player. You 
need guys like him on your team." 
</P>
<P>
 For Pearsall, tackling a ballcarrier in the open field was easy compared to 
picking a college. With the Feb. 2 signing date for football players fast 
approaching, he has narrowed his original list to four schools: UCLA, USC, 
Arizona State and Oregon. His final recruiting visit was to USC over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearsall is agonizing over several factors. His oldest brother, Jay, has a 
year left at Arizona State (another brother, Brian, plays football at Cal Poly 
San Luis Obispo); his girlfriend, Kayli Whitley, attends Oregon. And, although 
he feels no pressure, Pearsall admits that his parents, Jim and Linda, would 
prefer that he stay closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been making lists, comparing the good points and bad points of each of 
the schools," says Pearsall, who hopes to make his final decision this week. 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 USC and UCLA seem on the verge of excellent football recruiting classes. The 
Trojans could end up signing as many as nine community college players, highly 
unusual for a top program, in a large class numbering between 20 and 25. The 
latest of four community college players to enroll in time for the spring 
semester was defensive end Israel Ifeanyi (6-4, 230) of Orange Coast, a native 
of Nigeria. In addition, USC has unwritten commitments from offensive linemen 
Richard Beatie (6-6, 290) of Glendale and Heath Baughman (6-7, 290) of 
Bakersfield, and cornerback Mario Bradley (6-2, 180) of Cerritos. The Trojans 
are still recruiting running back-defensive back Leonard Green (6-foot, 180) of 
Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut and defensive lineman Anthony Sanford (6-6, 
270) of Pasadena. Green, who attended high school in Silver Spring, Md., took a 
trip to USC over the weekend and is trying to decide between the Trojans and 
Maryland. Another weekend visitor to USC was Valencia fullback-linebacker Chris 
Draft (6-1, 205), who has narrowed his choices to Stanford, UCLA and USC. High 
school standouts who committed to USC recently were: tight end Rome Douglas 
(6-7, 250) of Claremont, wide receiver Larry Parker (6-2, 180) of Bakersfield, 
linebacker Willie Perryman (6-4, 215) of Burbank, tackle Ken Bowen (6-7, 315) 
of Orlando, Fla., cornerback Prentice Hill (5-8, 170) of Dallas Carter, and 
defensive back Brian Kelly (6-1, 190) of Aurora, Colo. In spite of his 
commitment, Parker, perhaps the top wide receiver prospect on the West Coast, 
visited Notre Dame over the weekend. The Trojans also might sign running back 
Marlin Carey (5-10, 185) of San Diego Mt. Carmel, though he has not qualified 
academically. Having lost its top quarterback prospect, Scott Covington (6-3, 
175) of Dana Hills, who committed to Miami, USC is now recruiting Brad Otten 
(6-6, 215), who showed promise last season as a freshman at Weber State but has 
decided to transfer. Otten, from Tumwater, Wash., is also considering 
Washington State and Fresno State. He would be eligible to play immediately as 
a sophomore, thanks to a rule recently passed regarding transfers from Division 
I-AA schools to Division I-A. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA has received recent commitments from cornerback-wide receiver Javelin 
Guidry (5-10, 165) of Cerritos Gahr, brother of UCLA freshman defensive back 
Paul Guidry; standout wide receivers Jim McElroy (5-11, 165) of Washington High 
and Tod McBride (6-2, 180) of Walnut, and offensive lineman Terry Williams 
(6-6, 260) of El Dorado. The Bruins expect to sign community college linebacker 
Tim Waddleton (6-3, 215) of Hutchinson, Kan., who was at UCLA over the weekend. 
Waddleton also visited Wisconsin, Indiana, Kansas and Pittsburgh. Two other 
weekend visitors to Westwood were linebacker Brandon Williams (6-4, 240) of 
Buffalo and fullback Jarvis Watson (5-11, 215) of Downey Warren. Williams will 
decide between UCLA and Wisconsin; Watson will likely sign with the Bruins if 
he is accepted academically. In addition, UCLA is considered the favorite to 
sign highly regarded tight end Sheldon Jackson (6-4, 220) of Damien LaVerne. 
Jackson visited Nebraska over the weekend. The Bruins are also competing with 
the Cornhuskers and Miami for defensive lineman Jason McCullough (6-5, 250), a 
native of Allentown, Pa., who attends a prep school in Potomac, Md. . . . Add 
UCLA: Contrary to a published report, the Bruins are not recruiting community 
college quarterback Tony Banks (6-5, 210) of San Diego Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 However, two other San Diego prospects are high on UCLA's priority list: 
defensive lineman Darrell Russell (6-5, 290), of St. Augustine High) and 
linebacker Terrell Cade (6-3, 220) of Lincoln. Russell, arguably the West 
Coast's top prospect, is expected to choose from among UCLA, USC and Cal. 
Cade's short list includes UCLA, Cal, Washington State, Colorado and Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoop report: Jelani Gardner, the 6-6 All-American point guard from Bellflower 
St. John Bosco, took a recruiting trip to Minnesota over the weekend. He has 
one more official visit scheduled, to Syracuse, where he'll watch the Orangemen 
play Kentucky Feb. 12 in the Carrier Dome. Last Friday night, California Coach 
Todd Bozeman and Arizona State assistant George McQuarn were at St. John Bosco 
to see Gardner score 16 points as the Braves beat La Canada St. Francis, 52-46. 
Gardner, as unselfish as he is talented, attended the UCLA-Arizona game at 
Pauley Pavilion last week, and said his top three college choices were 
Arkansas, UCLA and Arizona State. The spring signing period for basketball 
players begins April 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Add UCLA-Arizona: Among high school standouts on hand to watch the Bruins' 
74-66 victory over the Wildcats were freshmen forwards Schea Cotton (Mater Dei) 
and twins Jarron and Jason Collins (Studio City Harvard-Westlake), and 
sophomore guard Olujimi Mann (Santa Ana Valley).

THE SOUNDS OF MUSIC ARE HEARD IN ANAHEIM; GATHERING: EVERY INSTRUMENT IN THE 
WORLD, ALONG WITH PEOPLE TO PLAY THEM, ARE ON DISPLAY AT CONVENTION CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Composers are missing the opportunity of a lifetime here. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprawling through the National Assn. of Music Merchants Winter Market that 
ends today at the Anaheim Convention Center is virtually every musical 
instrument in the world, in quantity, along with the people to play them, just 
begging for a guiding hand to lead them into a majestic symphony celebrating 
human diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the lack of a unifying composer keeps people from pounding away on 
all the instruments anyway, with the net effect being not so much a wall of 
sound but a tower of babble. Resounding throughout the Convention Center's six 
halls was a nearly maddening clash of Native American drums, Japanese flutes, 
Arabian dumbeks, warbling synths, disco beats, blaring horns, hip-hop samples, 
pianos, bagpipes, and the overriding noodling sounds -- to quote Eric Burdon 
from the decidedly more rhapsodic "Monterey" -- of 10,000 electric guitars 
a-groovin real loud. 
</P>
<P>
 If an earthquake hit, it might be a while before anyone noticed it amid the 
din, which began Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 At one booth, piano polish maker Barron Abramovitch displayed a photo montage 
of the havoc the quake caused at his Chatsworth home, and offered a glass bowl 
full of concrete rubble with a sign reading "Free Epicenter Souvenir." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the NAMM show (which is not open to the general public) is to 
allow musical merchandise manufacturers and distributors to introduce their 
wares to retailers, and it is a decidedly big business, drawing about 48,000 
people annually, with millions of dollars in orders being taken. 
</P>
<P>
 It is where instruments that will affect the sound of music in years to come 
are introduced, and where others that fail to catch the ear will fall by the 
wayside. 
</P>
<P>
 Musical instruments, at their best, are conduits for expression, invention, 
mood, individuality and soul, as well as being the tools on which a huge 
entertainment industry is founded. Given that, the NAMM sales floor might serve 
as an indicator for the state of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 In years past that indicator could be pretty grim. Through the '70s and much 
of the '80s, musicians generally felt that major manufacturers -- many of which 
had been bought up by corporate conglomerates -- had lost their vision and 
weren't putting out viable instruments.  
</P>
<P>
 And while some small independent firms were making innovative, quality 
instruments, it was painful to see the swift demise of hapless others who meant 
well but hadn't a clue of how to compete. Let us have a moment of silent 
remembrance for those departed makers of banana-flavored saxophone reeds and 
Chevy fin-shaped guitars. 
</P>
<P>
 But over the past several years, a remarkable turnaround has occurred. Major 
firms, often under new, smaller ownership, began making instruments that 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 A particular example is guitar-making giant Fender, late of Fullerton but 
largely relocated now to Scottsdale, Ariz. With both exacting reissues of its 
classic '50s and '60s guitars and amps (the coveted Fender tube reverb unit has 
been reissued this year) and creative variations blending in modern technology, 
the company is doing right by the legacy of its departed founder Leo Fender, 
whose decades of invention are being celebrated in an exhibition at the 
Fullerton Museum Center. 
</P>
<P>
 At the forefront of the current Fender company's efforts is its Custom Shop 
headquartered in Corona. There, instruments are made to a musician's exact 
specifications, along with radical designs originated by the plant's 40 master 
builders. Among their new works this year were an Egyptian-motif Stratocaster, 
a metal resonator Telecaster and a gold metal-flake Dick Dale signature model 
guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of their designs, such as the Signature Series (including Jeff Beck, 
Stevie Ray Vaughan and Eric Clapton models), have been successfully introduced 
into Fender's mass-produced line. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Custom Shop head John Page, "When we started the Custom Shop seven years 
ago with just two guys we were looking to resurrect the mystique of Fender. 
That had gone down over the (former corporate owner) CBS years. So it was a 
prestige building thing, where the company said, 'We don't care about making 
money, let's just make some great guitars.' 
</P>
<P>
 "As builders, we've found artistic freedom there. It's probably one of the few 
occasions that corporate America and art have been able to merge, where the 
artists don't feel stifled and the corporate side doesn't feel like they're 
bleeding. It's a nice profitable operation." 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarist John Jorgenson of Hellecasters and Desert Rose Band fame used to be 
one of Leo Fender's musical guinea pigs, trying out the guitars he developed in 
the '80s for the G&L Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Strolling the NAMM show Friday, Jorgenson remarked, "As I've both read and 
know from experience, Leo Fender and those old guys always wanted to talk to 
the players and listen to what they like and don't like. The business moved 
away from that for quite a while, but now they're sensitive to what musicians 
need again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something else that's bringing back the values those old vintage instruments 
had is now the age group that originally liked those things has moved into 
positions of influence. We're the old (dudes) in control now." 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever is in charge, they do seem to have more fun than one sees at other 
trade shows.  
</P>
<P>
 Samick guitars advertised their wares with a display in which a 
guitar-flailing teen-ager roamed his messy teen-ager's bedroom, safely behind 
bars bearing a sign reading Guitarus Teenageous. One vendor selling discotheque 
systems had go-go dancers frugging atop its booth. At the Marshall amp display, 
rep Michael Doyle urged customers to sample the firm's new 4,000-Watt bass amp: 
"Step into our sound room to hear them, and get your pancreas shifted around," 
he offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Some firms promoted their wares with private concerts featuring such name 
talents as Los Lobos, Richard Thompson and Buddy Guy. But the most creative 
marketing effort, by far, came from New Jersey-based Charlie Stringer Strings. 
Anyone making use of any of the 203 urinals at the Convention Center couldn't 
help but note that the plastic strainer in each bore Stringer's name, booth 
number and the invitation to come visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten an unbelievable response to that," said Stringer, who sells 
guitar strings called Snarling Dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Stringer's packaging and ads are full of flippant jokes, and says, "I find if 
you personalize the stuff like that, the kids love it. I've been getting fan 
mail." It has allowed his small company to find a niche in a very crowded end 
of the business, and thinks that bodes well for the state of the American 
entrepreneurial spirit. "This says we can all still get to Hollywood if we all 
put our eyes on the ball," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County successes include Huntington Beach's Actodyne General, which 
this year is introducing an acoustic guitar pickup to its line of acclaimed 
electric guitar pickups, which are used by Eric Clapton, and are stock features 
on several of Fender's upscale models.  
</P>
<P>
 Placentia's Bigheart Slide Co., meanwhile, has picked up the Hellecasters as 
endorsers for its guitar bottleneck slides, and introduced a line of ceramic 
slides.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though guitars are still the noisiest kid on the block at the NAMM show, the 
only things that might truly be regarded as innovations are happening in the 
somewhat less sexy realm of microchips. It is a brave new world, as noted 
Chantays' surf guitarist Gil Orr observing the show, "We're like typewriter 
guys looking at computers here." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the current high-tech excitement at NAMM lies in the burgeoning amount 
of hard and software available to set desktop computers to musical tasks. There 
are innumerable means now for getting your PC or Mac to produce, mix and edit 
music, so that anyone can be a desktop Phil Spector. 
</P>
<P>
 The most readily impressive item for guitar-heads was the G-Vox from Lyrrus 
Inc., which "puts your guitar and computer on speaking terms," says the 
company's Kristin Stearns. The $395 product has vast possibilities, including 
the ability to play something on your instrument and have it instantly 
converted into sheet music form. It also offers tutorial functions where one 
can follow note-by-note on computer screen diagrams of riffs by guitar hotshots 
such as Steve Morse. 
</P>
<P>
 The standout innovation of the show came from Yamaha, which has its U.S. 
headquarters in Buena Park. Yamaha has long led the field in synthesizers, but 
has practically thrown out all it has done previously in designing its new VL 1 
(Virtual Lead 1), the harbinger of a whole new synthesizer technology which is 
not dissimilar to the computer virtual reality models of physical environments. 
 
</P>
<P>
 According to Yamaha rep Jim Presley, "The VL 1 is unique in the fact that 
there are no samples, no tone generators, no oscillators as all previous synths 
have relied on. It instead is a computer model of a musical instrument. Its 
physics are the same as the physics of the real musical instrument. As a result 
you get something sounding very much and reacting very much like a musical 
instrument." 
</P>
<P>
 The computer modeling uses a complex algorithm to simulate the physical 
properties of a real instrument. That model in the VL's case is a tube, which 
can be configured to respond like any number of woodwind instruments, including 
a few that don't exist. Like a real-life instrument, there are more nuances to 
master than on a standard synth. The payoff is that it is far more musically 
expressive -- responsive to a player's input -- than previous synths. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it is modeled on wind-driven instruments, the instrument, which looks 
much like other keyboard synths, is best used in conjunction with a MIDI breath 
controller, into which a player blows. Unlike the polyphonic synths long 
standard on the market, the VL 1 can only sound two notes at once. That is one 
more than you can get on a real sax, though, Presley points out. 
</P>
<P>
 They do have a working polyphonic prototype, which may eventually find its way 
to the market for $30,000 or $40,000, Presley says. The VL 1 lists for $4,995, 
which may seem a lot to pay to avoid the taste of a sax reed (banana-flavored 
or no), but the VL 1 may well be the breakthrough in the lack of warmth and 
expression that even synth manufacturers have admitted to be a hurdle in their 
products.  
</P>
<P>
 It's innovations like these that can set players on the path to a career in 
music, such as street musician Mike Masley, who was setting up his Hungarian 
hammered dulcimer in the chill evening air outside the NAMM show Friday. On a 
microphone stand he had mounted an inverted 7-Up liter bottle, with the bottom 
cut off to accept donations. "They're a pretty responsive audience here," he 
commented.

'SCHINDLER'S LIST' BREAKS THE JINX FOR SPIELBERG; GOLDEN GLOBES: AWARDS END 
SPECULATION THAT DIRECTOR WOULD GET COLD SHOULDER AGAIN; HANKS, HUNTER, 
WILLIAMS ALSO HONORED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. FOX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Now, I can breathe again," said Steven Spielberg, as he stepped off a 
backstage podium with his two Golden Globe Awards for "Schindler's List" -- the 
first time he has actually won one of Hollywood's major film prizes. In the 
past, he had been nominated for Globes and Oscars but never took one home. 
</P>
<P>
 Only minutes earlier, Spielberg was sitting among the hundreds of celebrities 
and entertainment industry power brokers who had gathered for Saturday night's 
51st annual presentation of the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn.'s annual prizes. 
Hollywood's "Moses" himself (a.k.a. Charlton Heston) delivered the 
announcement: "Schindler's List," a black-and-white film depicting the 
Holocaust and a German industrialist who saved more than 1,300 Jews from Nazi 
death camps, had won the best dramatic picture prize for 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the evening, actor Gregory Peck had opened the envelope and read 
Spielberg's name as best director. 
</P>
<P>
 The two wins ended film community speculation about whether the director of 
the two box-office giants "E.T." and "Jurassic Park" would again get a cold 
shoulder when it came to prizes. His previous nominated directing efforts for 
"Jaws," "The Color Purple" and "Raiders of the Lost Ark" had been overlooked by 
the Golden Globe voters -- and the members of the Academy of Motion Picture 
Arts and Sciences who vote for the Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
 To many, it appeared as though the Golden Globes, held at the Beverly Hilton, 
may have been -- once again -- the dress rehearsal for the Academy Awards to be 
presented on March 21. 
</P>
<P>
 But what a dress rehearsal. Nerves were jittery from the Los Angeles area 
earthquake and the aftershocks as the show began. Hostess Faye Dunaway 
expressed thanks for the safety and survival of the guests in the ballroom. At 
the earlier cocktail party, the earthquake even beat out Oscar speculation as 
Topic No. 1. An unnerved Bette Midler, nominated for best actress in a 
television film for her role in the musical "Gypsy," left town with her family 
and did not attend. She won the Globe, however. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an evening that drew a variety of celebrities -- the music world's 
Janet Jackson, Huey Lewis, Clint Black and Bruce Springsteen (who won a Globe 
for best song for a motion picture, "Philadelphia"), TV's Jerry Seinfeld, 
Steven Bochco and Roseanne Arnold, plus Al Pacino, Angela Lansbury, Sally 
Kirkland, Anjelica Huston and Jack Lemmon. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening's emotional highs were the heartfelt acceptance remarks that Tom 
Hanks gave as he won for best actor in a drama for his role in "Philadelphia," 
as an attorney dying of AIDS, and the enthusiastic standing ovation that 
greeted Peck as he announced Spielberg's directing award. 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg said the best film honor for "Schindler's List" really belongs to 
the 1,300 courageous survivors of the Polish concentration camp depicted in his 
movie. It was an emotional moment also for Spielberg's co-producers Branko 
Lustig, who survived the Auschwitz camp, and Gerald Molen, who observed "that 
one man can and did make a difference" -- the suggestion being that Schindler 
took a chance and so did Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
 In remarks backstage, Spielberg was asked if "Schindler's List" was the 
favorite of his films. "You're not supposed to prefer one child over another. 
But since the others won't take it personally, I can say that 'Schindler" is my 
proudest moment as a filmmaker. . . . I'd trade three 'Jurassic Parks' . . . 
for all the letters that I've gotten since the movie opened." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about an incident last week where rowdy, laughing students in Oakland 
disrupted a showing of his film, Spielberg had this response: "In certain 
socioeconomic circles a lot of kids are desensitized to violence, because of 
what's happening in the streets. Lots of them are living their own Holocaust." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanks said, in part: "It is odd and surreal for me to stand here and say that 
I feel lucky. As a heterosexual man who does not have AIDS, to say that I was 
lucky to play him -- a gay man who suffers from terminal AIDS -- to stand here 
tonight after all that we've been through as a city, to stand here today in the 
midst of all that we're going through as a nation, as a people, as a society in 
the face of the current Holocaust that is taking hundreds of thousands of 
lives. However, I have to say that I am a very lucky man." 
</P>
<P>
 In all, "Schindler's List" won three awards, the most of any film. 
Screenwriter Steven Zaillian picked up the prize for his work. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Williams won as best actor in a comedy for his cross-dressing role as a 
nanny in "Mrs. Doubtfire," and the film was named best film -- comedy or 
musical. That tied with "Philadelphia" as a winner of two prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 A surprised Angela Bassett arrived on stage to whoops and cheers as she 
collected the best actress prize in a musical or comedy for her performance as 
pop star Tina Turner in "What's Love Got to Do With It." 
</P>
<P>
 Holly Hunter, who won as best actress in a drama, for her non-speaking role in 
"The Piano," told the press: "It's remarkable how much I didn't miss speaking. 
There's a magic -- and a lot of economy -- in keeping things private for 
yourselves. Still, nine weeks into the shoot, (co-star) Sam Neill and I were 
sitting in the make-up trailer and I said to him that I felt I hadn't done my 
part yet. That's probably because I hadn't spoken." 
</P>
<P>
 On the television side, the Castle Rock Entertainment sitcom "Seinfeld" on NBC 
collected three prizes -- for best series, actor, and supporting actress Julia 
Louis-Dreyfus. 
</P>
<P>
 HBO's cutthroat business drama "Barbarians at the Gate" and its star James 
Garner won two Golden Globes. 
</P>
<P>
 Another multiple winner was ABC's controversial dramatic series "NYPD Blue," 
produced by Steven Bochco Productions. It won as best series and for actor 
David Caruso. 
</P>
<P>
 Backstage, Caruso told reporters: "I was one of the people living in the 100 
buildings destroyed in Santa Monica (by the earthquake). So this is a nice way 
to end the week. I guess I see this as a vindication since people at one point 
were after the show (for its language and occasional nudity). In the end, the 
viewers made the decision." The winners:

A LIFE OF MUSIC ESOTERICA; ELLIOTT CARTER, 85, HAILED FOR HIS WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Longevity can have its downside for a celebrated composer like Elliott Carter. 
In town through January as part of an 85th birthday celebration, Carter has 
been engaged in a whirlwind schedule of concerts of his music by various 
ensembles around the Southland, culminating in a concert at the Japan America 
Theater tonight as part of the L.A. Philharmonic's "Green Umbrella" series. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, he ushered the visitor into the living room of the Santa Monica 
apartment where he has been set up by his main sponsor, the Getty Foundation, 
inching past the Steinway baby grand filling up half the living room. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no rest for the restlessly creative -- not to mention amply 
commissioned -- composer, of whatever age. "I thought I was going to get some 
work done while I was out here," the New York-based Carter said, gesturing to a 
desk strewn with manuscript paper work-in-progress, "but they've kept me pretty 
busy with concerts and appearances. This peace and quiet I thought was going to 
be here wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 You get the sense that it is, for a composer too often neglected in his own 
country, a happily hectic visit. What began as a Getty-sponsored monthlong 
visit expanded into a more multi-organizational effort. Between the several 
concerts by the Southwest Chamber Society and the EAR Unit and tonight's 
Philharmonic concert, Southern California is getting a full dose of Carter this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 The sum effect is a retrospective overview of the composer's music. Tonight's 
concert, for instance, ranges from his 1948 Cello Sonata to the multilayered 
Double Concerto for Harpsichord and Piano and Two Chamber Orchestras of 1960, 
to "In Sleep, In Thunder," settings of poems by Robert Lloyd written in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the work of Pierre Boulez, Milton Babbit and other composers working in a 
post-serial vocabulary, Carter's music -- of the last 40 years, anyway -- has 
carried the torch of the 12-tone revolution laid down by Arnold Schoenberg, but 
taken to another evolutionary level. 
</P>
<P>
 For Carter, what could be dryly intellectual becomes a puzzle and a drama. He 
likes to have instrumentalists assume varying roles, as if in heated dialogue 
in an implicitly theatrical exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 In conversation, too, the composer alternates between seriousness and 
ingenuousness, with a disarming smile that occasionally consumes his face. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, who has taught at several prominent East Coast schools, is widely 
considered to be among the most important living composers, whose 
complex-but-conversational writing has won him international acclaim, if not 
household-name popularity. Winner of two Pulitzers, the United States National 
medal of the Arts, and a constant stream of commissions -- mostly from Europe 
-- Carter makes music that is still relatively obscure, although a recording of 
his Violin Concerto recently earned him a Grammy nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my recent works have been commissioned abroad," he stated 
matter-of-factly, with a shrug of resignation "except for a piece I finished 
recently for the Chicago Symphony. It's because I think my music got the 
reputation of being very difficult, and nobody in America wants to work." 
</P>
<P>
 The musical organizations rallying to put on the L.A.-based Carter celebration 
represent part of the global network of groups who have made Carter's music 
part of their regular repertoire. "I don't like to boast," Carter said, "but 
the people who spend a lot of effort on my music find it very rewarding. I've 
always thought, to tell the truth, that I was really not writing for an 
audience, but writing for performers playing the music. When they get over the 
horror of playing the pieces, which are sometimes very hard for them, then they 
like to play it." 
</P>
<P>
 As seemingly dissonant and arcane as Carter's music sounds to many ears, his 
earlier pieces tap into a more neo-classical language, partly as a result of 
his studies with the renowned, now-deceased Nadia Boulanger, who taught 
numerous 20th-Century composers of note. He also acknowledges a debt to jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always felt that my music derived from jazz," Carter asserted. "It came out 
of the idea of having a regular rhythm accompanied by improvisation. My music 
is continually playing between regular beats and improvisatory things -- 
sometimes simultaneously, sometimes one after the other." 
</P>
<P>
 Based as it often is on shifting relationships of rhythm and emotional 
character, Carter's music tends to avoid traditional forms, in the search for 
"an internal diversity that involves you immediately in a new kind of structure 
that doesn't fit in the ordinary kind of musical structure," as the composer 
puts it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it hard sometimes to find that in a piece of any length. In the old 
music, you went back to the beginning or did something similar. But when you're 
constantly going on and on and changing, the problem of how you get on with the 
last 10 minutes of a longer piece is a very interesting problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can always make a big bang somewhere," he laughed, "but you can't make a 
big bang if it's a flute piece." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, even working on a small canvas -- and the composer is known for his 
intimate chamber works -- Carter likes to inject marked contrasts of character. 
Stagnant or meditative passages are not encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed out that even "Riconoscenza per Goffredo Petrassi," a solo violin 
piece dedicated to the Italian composer Petrassi, which was played in a recent 
EAR Unit concert, is charged with a nervous eventfulness. It's as if the 
violinist is engaged in an interior monologue involving multiple personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is the idea that there are interruptions," Carter explained, "but life 
goes on and on. Petrassi is a man who somehow is jolly and tells jokes, and 
then other times is sad and melancholy. I thought it would be interesting to 
write a piece that was interrupted but still had one long continuity." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the esoteric circles of his appeal, Carter has a kind of pragmatic 
philosophy about his music. He feels that he is writing about life as we know 
it, not making mazes in an ivory tower of his own devising. 
</P>
<P>
 He leaned forward on the couch and surmised, "It seems to me that what it's 
all about really is the way we lead our human lives. It seems to me that too 
much music has been too conventional in all of this. It isn't a picture of 
living somehow. I've tried to do that, to picture thinking and feeling."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: MORE CHEAP CHATTER ON DAYTIME TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trying to fix NBC's feeble daytime schedule by adding "Jane Whitney" and 
"Leeza" is like trying to make Quasimodo prettier by grafting on another hump. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there they are -- along with syndicated newcomer "Rolonda" on KCAL-TV 
Channel 9 -- affirming the continued cynicism and dysfunction of daytime 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 Behold the recycled legion of kinks, the weird and fringe wounded, the 
publicity-seeking afflicted and walking spasms of humanity, the bizarre 
subcultures that, through repeated exposure on national TV, become accepted as 
mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 And those are just the hosts. 
</P>
<P>
 You get a sexual thrill from walking your dog dressed as Napoleon, call this 
800 number. You think your dentist is really Donald Duck? And you yourself are 
Goofy? Join our panel and tell inquiring minds your story. Have we got a show 
for you. 
</P>
<P>
 The only positive result of the Northridge earthquake was that its coverage 
here delayed the Los Angeles debuts of the new talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Leeza" used to be "John & Leeza," an hour of show-biz chats and celeb 
interviews. But low ratings prompted NBC to drop the bubbly Leeza Gibbon's 
co-host, John Tesh, and have her front a standard audience-participation talk 
show exploring topics "of interest to women." As if other daytime talk shows 
were aimed at longshoremen. 
</P>
<P>
 If ever a show appeared to be on the cutting edge of mustiness, this is it. On 
Thursday's "Leeza" you saw two women sitting together, holding hands. Naturally 
one of them was once a man. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leeza" and "Jane Whitney" (9 a.m.) are confirmation that the network 
considers its daytime audience dim bulbs. The gratuitous, exploitative Whitney 
pads around in her stocking feet, her hybrid personality fusing the surly 
toughness of a bail bondsman with the naivete (surely posed) of someone who has 
just awakened from a 10-year sleep. Her syndicated talk show was near the 
bottom of the food chain, naturally making it a leading candidate for NBC's 
daytime schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitney joined the pursuit of the Nancy Kerrigan-Tonya Harding story Friday. 
That included repeated replays of that overused footage of the clobbered 
Kerrigan crying out, "Why? Why?" 
</P>
<P>
 No one on the show connected Harding to the attack that already has resulted 
in the arrests of her ex-husband and three others. And Whitney said: "She's not 
been charged, she's not been indicted, she's not been arraigned." Very noble. 
Yet the hour's message was mixed. Accompanied by scary music, its repeatedly 
flashed title was "Ice Rivals." Get it? And one of the guests was Verna Heath, 
famous for being the alleged target of Wanda Holloway in the Texas cheerleading 
case. Whitney's introduction: "Next a woman who relates to the jealousy and 
evil that may have motivated the attack on Nancy Kerrigan." 
</P>
<P>
 Jealousy from whom if not "ice rival" Harding? 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, on came a woman identified as Harding's "second mom," but not the 
one earlier claiming to be her surrogate mother on "Sally Jessy Raphael" and 
"CBS This Morning." On came a fellow skater supportive of Harding. On came two 
Kerrigan friends. On came Russel Rietz, who claimed that Harding's so-called 
bodyguard offered him $65,000 to murder or break the legs of Kerrigan. On came 
the editor of the Harding fan club newsletter, complaining about "gratuitous 
negativity" aimed at Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 Gratuitous negativity? Did Whitney's eyes light up or what? 
</P>
<P>
 But no such luck. Yes, a man in the audience screamed at Rietz, and two 
panelists clashed over whether Harding was a money grubber. But this was 
relative sweetness.  
</P>
<P>
 With no prolonged arguments or whipped-up audience frenzy, this show was a 
bust by Whitney standards, the opportunity to distort and create false fears 
and paranoia disappearing right before her. Better days were coming, though, 
evidenced by this 800-number recruiting pitch that appeared on the screen 
midway through the hour: "If you are willing to do anything to stop your 
child's impending marriage, please call . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, anything!  
</P>
<P>
 "Jane Whitney." Why? Why? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Phil Donahue was schmoozing with famous-for-being-nasty Zsa Zsa last 
week and two sisters were calling each other sluts on "Jenny Jones," someone 
named Laura told Rolonda Watts, "I had eating disorders. I cleaned my house 
twice a day. None of that is normal." 
</P>
<P>
 Abnormality? All right!  
</P>
<P>
 Look, it's a dirty job that "Inside Edition" alumnus Watts has taken on as 
host of the new "Rolonda" at 2 p.m. on Channel 11. But somebody has to make the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Watts tackled sexy lingerie on Friday. She needed a breather after Thursday's 
intense show about the repressed and fake memory syndromes. A therapist had 
induced Laura to believe that her parents sexually abused her. But they hadn't. 
They were on the stage with her now. So was her 14-year-old daughter, who was 
crying. Then Laura started crying. Then Watts held their hands because, like 
Sally Jessy, she cares. Really cares. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a woman named Kimberly claimed she really did repress her memory of 
sexual abuse. Ditto for her, added her sister, who did, however, deny saying on 
ABC's "PrimeTime Live" that she once killed babies and drank blood. "That was 
taken completely out of context," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the dueling experts, one who believed in the repressed memory 
syndrome, one who didn't. Then audience members berated the skeptical expert. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you believe this?" Watts said. Unfortunately, yes. If only you could 
repress your memory of "Rolonda." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky for Watts, meanwhile, Laura and her family are all extremely overweight. 
She can have them all back when she does her show on fat people with fake 
memory syndrome.

SURFING'S AMBASSADOR GOING STRONG AT 78 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From his cramped kitchen that doubles as an office, Bruce Hopping is burning 
the midnight oil, pounding out yet another nightly blitz of faxes. 
Destinations: Rio de Janeiro, Morocco and Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nighttime is the only time I get to reach people in other countries because 
of the time differences," Hopping said, "so I rise every day about 10:30 in the 
morning and I don't get to bed till 3 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
 His habits are those of an investment banker. But portfolios are not his 
interest. Hopping is Orange County's surfing ambassador. He has spent more than 
two decades as an organizer of international surfing contests and has helped 
introduce that sport to Third World countries. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent evening, Hopping sent dispatches first to Brazil for an upcoming 
cultural exchange with U.S. surfers and Brazilians scheduled for May, then to 
Morocco, thanking the government for its help during a visit in December, and 
then Greece, where Hopping is sponsoring a trip in August for an all-star water 
polo team from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 At 78, you would think he would slow down. But he hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Hopping accompanied U.S. amateur surf teams that visited Tahiti, 
Bali, Barbados and Morocco. In addition, he scouted surfing venues in Western 
Samoa and visited Florida's International Swimming Hall of Fame, where he sits 
on the hall's board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a wealthy New Jersey family, Hopping was vice president of his 
father's lumber company and transferred a portion of its assets into the Kalos 
Kagathos Foundation, a private, nonprofit organization he formed in 1953. Kalos 
Kagathos translates from Greek to "physical distinction, nobility of mind." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my goal when I founded the foundation to put athletic fitness on a 
pedestal, much like the Greeks did," Hopping said. "I'm trying to perpetuate 
something started thousands of years ago in Athens to mix academics with 
sports." 
</P>
<P>
 He is venerated in the sports community. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people like to get excited about organizing these different events 
and then they quit. Bruce doesn't," said Jim Machado, a north San Diego County 
surfing coach who took a foundation-sponsored team on an historic visit to 
Vietnam two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't take no for an answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Vietnam, where his parents served as diplomats, Hopping grew up in 
Port Newark, N.J., served as a U.S. Army pilot during World War II, and joined 
the Navy in the 1950s. He was a swimmer and later a swimming coach at the 
Navy's Bainbridge, Md., basic training center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hopping's life was touched by scandal and he received a bad conduct discharge 
after Hopping publicly claimed some officers had supplied sailors with inferior 
beef while selling quality beef on the market for personal profit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy eventually charged Hopping with undermining discipline and publicly 
discrediting commanding officers. At the time, the press, which extensively 
covered the dispute, dubbed Hopping a "millionaire sailor" who bucked the 
brass. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of the Navy, Hopping formed the foundation and moved to Laguna Beach, 
where he has been an outspoken activist and frequently a critic of the school 
district and city over the years. He has, among other things, urged local high 
schools to drop football, which he considers too dangerous, and increase their 
aquatic sports programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation organizes trips abroad and offers scholarships to athletes who 
can't afford the travel. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopping has become a fixture at Laguna Beach high school aquatic sports 
banquets and at other high school banquets in the county, where trophies and 
awards are donated by the foundation. Coaches credit Hopping's foundation for 
heavily supporting swimming, diving, synchronized swimming and gymnastics, in 
addition to surfing and water polo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bruce is very generous and he knows how much work goes into the sports of 
water polo, swimming and surfing," said Robert Gaughran, Rancho Santiago's 
water polo coach, who was inducted into the U.S. Water Polo Hall of Fame last 
year. He has known Hopping since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled how Hopping bought medallions for every student on the California 
Interscholastic Federation winning team and for the runners-up, and 
certificates for students named to the CIF all-star team. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's kind of a quirky guy with the school board in Laguna Beach, but believe 
me, his heart's in the right place," said Gaughran. "And the thing with Bruce 
is that he asks nothing in return." 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly the foundation's most significant, and controversial, trip was to 
China Beach in Vietnam in 1992. Before leaving, Vietnam veterans and others 
complained that the trip was helping a Communist government, while others 
supported them and mailed in donations. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip, with its obvious symbolism for a group of returning Americans, 
received worldwide media coverage and was credited for paving the way for the 
first professional surfing meet in Vietnam, held a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 Politics aside, Machado said it left an indelible impression on the young 
Vietnamese. "We gave them extra surfboards, and we taught a group of swimmers 
from Da Nang the basics of surfing. It was incredible. Within two to three 
days, they were actually standing on the boards, not surfing, but at least they 
got up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopping sometimes greets these cultural exchanges with mixed emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult introducing Third World cultures to a California kid who's 14, 
affluent and whose idea of cuisine is limited to a McDonald's menu," Hopping 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, the youths have an unforgettable experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone can go to Morocco to surf. With his trips, you don't just go surfing. 
They're different," said Chad Mitchell, 17, a Dana Hills High School junior and 
veteran of Kalos Kagathos trips to Bali, Tahiti and Morocco. "With Bruce, you 
get to meet the people, see and learn more about the culture."

 As he pleaded for his life, a Mexican immigrant who had dreamed of earning 
enough money to help his children was fatally shot Sunday by a robber who then 
critically wounded the man's brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the gunman escaped with $150. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Granados, 27, died hours after the 3 a.m. shooting, and his brother, 
Enrique Granados, 25, remains in critical condition, Santa Ana Police Sgt. Dick 
Faust said. Both men lived in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 A brother-in-law, Jesus Ramirez, 25, who was robbed but escaped injury, said 
the assailant shot Juan Granados after he begged the man in Spanish "to just 
take the money and leave us alone." 
</P>
<P>
 "The robber had walked up to me, put a gun to my head and said, 'We want your 
money,' " Ramirez said in an interview Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The two brothers and Ramirez were attacked as they put gasoline in their truck 
after it ran out of gas in an alley in the 1100 block of West 1st Street, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber first took Ramirez's cash, then pointed the gun at Enrique 
Granados, who took money out of his wallet and handed it to the bandit. Juan 
Granados, who was in the driver's seat of the truck, also surrendered his 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Granados then got out and walked to the rear of the truck after he became 
concerned that the robber might harm his brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 Granados "told the thief, 'We don't want any trouble. Take the money and 
please leave us alone,' " Ramirez said. "But he pointed the gun at Juan and 
fired two shots. Juan fell at the back of the truck. As Enrique turned to run, 
the guy shot him once in the chest near his neck." 
</P>
<P>
 As the gunman continued firing, Ramirez started to back away. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then he turned and fired once at me. The bullet missed me but I heard it 
and felt it as it zipped over my head," Ramirez said, motioning with his right 
hand to show the bullet's path just an inch above his head. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman and a companion then fled, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez said he ran to a telephone and reported the robbery to police and 
summoned paramedics for his wounded relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Granados was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange in critical condition 
and died of his injuries about 11 a.m., Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrique Granados remained in critical condition Sunday night at Western 
Medical Center-Santa Ana, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Faust said it appears the men were random victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez said he believes the gunman, whom he described as Latino, about 23 
years old and wearing a mustache, may have been involved with gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had on dark clothes and had a very short haircut like the cholos wear," 
Ramirez said, adding that he failed to get a good look at the thief's 
companion, who did not appear to be armed. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $150 taken by the robbers, Ramirez said: "That's not much when you 
think about it, is it? My brother-in-law's life was worth much, much more. 
That's why we told them we didn't want any trouble. We said to them, 'Here, 
take the money. Just leave us alone. We don't want any trouble.' But they shot 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Granados, who was from Michoacan, Mexico, had been living with a sister 
in a Santa Ana apartment for several years. He and Ramirez had worked together 
painting automobiles, while Granados' brother, Enrique, assembled wood 
furniture at a Santa Ana company. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Ramirez and another relative telephoned the brothers' mother in 
Mexico and told her what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't say much," Ramirez said. "I got on the telephone and told her, 
'I'm sorry, senora. But your son was shot and killed during a robbery.' She 
sounded sick with grief." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not the first time tragedy has hit the family. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Granados' wife and mother of his four children, who remain in Mexico with 
their grandmother, died of an illness several years ago. Granados wanted to 
come to the United States to earn enough money to improve his family's life, 
according to Ramirez and other family members contacted Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The family, which is poor, doesn't have enough money for burial, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been working hard, but the recession hasn't been good. And now, we just 
got robbed," Ramirez said.

STILL AT HOME ON THE RANGE; HISTORY: RANCHO MISSION VIEJO, PASSED DOWN THROUGH 
THE GENERATIONS, OFFERS A MODERN-DAY GLIMPSE AT SOUTH COUNTY'S CATTLE-HERDING 
PAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a crowded county where living space is usually measured out in small lots 
and densely packed apartments and condominiums, the vast Rancho Mission Viejo 
might seem as mythical as a tale in a dime Western. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch sprawls over 40,000 acres of amber hills and grasslands that is pure 
cattle country. Since 1882, cowboys have ridden the brand of the Rancho Mission 
Viejo, repairing fences and rounding up cattle for market. 
</P>
<P>
 But while progress and development wipes out much of Orange County's pioneer 
heritage, the last roundup will probably never be seen, at least while the 
O'Neill family owns this ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been in the family since patriarch Richard O'Neill Sr. bought the ranch 
more than a century ago. In recent decades, real estate interests have come to 
the O'Neills with proposals to build everything from an amusement park centered 
on a Mexican village theme to a garbage dump on ranch property. 
</P>
<P>
 Although family members are major land developers in Orange County, when it 
comes to building on the family ranch, their answer has been a flat "No." 
</P>
<P>
 "All these people have designs on the land," said Gilbert Aguirre, senior vice 
president of ranch operations. "Our world is getting smaller, but the family is 
dedicated to being in the cattle business for the next 110 years." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most influential families in South County, the O'Neills own the 
Santa Margarita Co., builder of Rancho Santa Margarita, a planned community. 
</P>
<P>
 They have strong links to the historic mission town of San Juan Capistrano. 
Dick O'Neill, 70, the millionaire grandson of the ranch's founder, owns the El 
Adobe restaurant in town and is seeking to buy a block of downtown commercial 
property. He also has been heavily involved with the county Democratic Party 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 The family's wealth was estimated at $500 million by Forbes magazine in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the ranch and the city share a rough and tumble legacy that lived through 
the 1950s when old-timers will attest that it wasn't uncommon to see cowboys 
riding their horses through the local saloons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were golden times," said Tony Moiso, the great-grandson of Richard 
O'Neill Sr. "San Juan Capistrano was so isolated in those days before the 
interstate was built in the early '60s. We feel very much tied to the town." 
</P>
<P>
 Once, 15,000 head of cattle were raised at the Rancho Mission Viejo. Today, 
about 6,000 head graze there, still making it the largest cattle operation 
remaining in Southern California, local historian Jim Sleeper said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, development has shrunk the prime grasslands available for cattle and 
the Rancho Mission Viejo has been forced to buy acreage in northern Nevada, 
where the herd is sent for feeding every winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Beef prices have been good in recent years, but "historically, it's not been 
very profitable to raise cattle for most people," Aguirre said. "You can't 
control the prices set on your product." 
</P>
<P>
 To generate the income to run a ranch about three times the size of San 
Francisco, the family, headed by Moiso, began planning the community of Rancho 
Santa Margarita at the feet of the Saddleback Mountains in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Angered over development of the pristine canyon area, the plans drew heavy 
criticism from local residents and environmentalists. But it was approved, and 
today, 20,000 residents live in the half-completed development that will be 
built out by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, seeking to do more than develop land, company officials established a 
1,600-acre nature conservancy on the ranch that's open to public tours. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could throw a fence around the place and keep everyone out, but that would 
be terribly irresponsible," said Moiso, who oversees ranch operations. "I feel 
blessed to be able to develop a portion of the land and remain a rancher on the 
rest." 
</P>
<P>
 However, local environmentalist Sherry Meddick is torn about the Santa 
Margarita Co.'s environmental record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always felt so funny that someone could donate incredible resources and 
also be responsible for the development coming behind it that impacts these 
preserves," said Meddick, a Silverado Canyon resident who works for Greenpeace 
in Los Angeles. "They donate the park land, but unfortunately the flood plain 
from the (housing) developments flow into the park area." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a 57-year-old Irishman named Richard O'Neill Sr. who made cattle a big 
business in South County.  
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill was a former butcher who had successfully operated a ranch in Merced 
County. When the estate of John Forster, who had accumulated more than 200,000 
acres in Orange and San Diego counties in the mid-1850s, was put up for sale, 
O'Neill saw an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Stretching from Oceanside to Aliso Creek in what is now Lake Forest, O'Neill 
was looking at 359 square miles of prime grazing territory. 
</P>
<P>
 He found a financier in silver magnate James Flood, who was willing to put up 
$457,000. In 1882, the men purchased the vast plot of land. O'Neill lived 
another 24 years, surviving to see the Santa Fe Railroad lay tracks through the 
ranch, greatly increasing its profitability. 
</P>
<P>
 The large property was divided in the late 1930s when the Flood heirs decided 
to leave the cattle business. The O'Neills kept the Orange County portion of 
the ranch, a decision that soon proved prescient when the federal government in 
1942 enacted the War Powers Act and through its eminent domain powers took over 
what is now Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
 The family started the planned community of Mission Viejo in the mid-1960s, 
but eventually sold the 10,000-acre development in 1972 to the Phillip Morris 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout their dealings, the family has been determined to remain cattle 
ranchers. Three generations of O'Neills have run the ranch, and many ranch 
hands were born there and are raising their children on the land. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual spring roundup, when calves are born and branded, remains a deeply 
ingrained ranch tradition. The El Viaje de Portola, where several hundred 
riders re-create the trail of Spanish explorer Gaspar de Portola in South 
County, is another way the family celebrates the area's heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to have fun," Moiso said. "All the old ranching families are gone, 
but we're still here because we feel a responsibility to take care of this 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will always be good to this ranch because it sure has been good to us."

ELECTION RESULTS STIR VIETNAMESE COMMUNITY RANCOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THUAN LE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A meeting to settle grievances over a disputed election in the Vietnamese 
community turned into a victory ceremony Sunday for an Irvine businessman who 
was officially declared the new leader of expatriates throughout Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately afterward, members of a losing party in the election for president 
of the Vietnamese Community of Southern California called the meeting a sham 
and said they might appeal election results to a board of representatives from 
88 Vietnamese organizations in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the idea of the election was a good thing, but now I feel cheated," 
said Hong Mai Nguyen of Los Angeles. "The way this election was handled was all 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the controversy, Ban Binh Bui, the new president, is faced with uniting 
300,000 Vietnamese from Santa Barbara to San Diego into a political force, 
although only 5,000 Southern Californians of Vietnamese descent voted in the 
Jan. 2 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of Bui's rival, Huu Dinh Vo, a pediatrician from Pomona, claim the 
voting failed to meet the organization's election guidelines. They say 162 
votes -- enough to swing the election to Vo -- were unaccounted for, and that 
the balloting ran 40 minutes overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 An initial count showed that Bui had 2,273 votes; Vo received 2,191; and Chung 
Nguyen, a computer analyst from Westminster, who ran from a third party, had 
622 votes, according to election organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 Invitations for the meeting, held at Cafe Tao Phung on Garden Grove Boulevard, 
said the purpose was to settle complaints from the ticket headed by Vo. 
</P>
<P>
 The invitations from the election committee of the Vietnamese Community of 
Southern California were sent to the organization's former board members, the 
advisory panel for the election committee, the press, the three candidates and 
their supporters, and to voters concerned about the election results. 
</P>
<P>
 Many said they came expecting to hear Vo's complaints and discussion about how 
to resolve the election dispute. However, the election committee had decided to 
hold a hearing about the voting in private Saturday afternoon without notifying 
the public, according to Chau Tue Carey, head of the volunteer election 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our guidelines do not require us to have voters at the hearing," Carey said 
Sunday. "If that was so, we'd have to have all 5,000 of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Carey said the election committee and its advisory panel had listened to Vo's 
15 complaints and had judged them to have been caused by technical difficulties 
outside the organizers' control. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the committee concluded the voting ran overtime because balloting had 
started 40 minutes late. But nobody could explain the difference of 162 votes, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know if it was a paperwork problem or what, but we don't know where 
those ballots are," said Carey, adding that she had voted for Vo. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Carey, the election committee and its advisory panel met and 
jointly voted 14 to 4 to accept Bui as the victor. 
</P>
<P>
 Vo, who was represented at the private meeting Saturday, said he came to Cafe 
Tao Phung expecting a discussion of his complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead, the result of the private vote on Saturday was announced at 1 
p.m. Sunday to the gathering of about 100 people at the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Many clapped and cheered, but Vo and his supporters were stunned. Several 
raised their hands to make comments. However, organizers said they would take 
questions from the press first. 
</P>
<P>
 Several journalists from the Vietnamese-language media then said they had no 
questions and called for all three candidates to shake hands onstage, which 
they did to a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the restaurant, Vo's supporters were furious. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a revolt against the voters," said Dung Nguyen of Garden Grove. "This 
is like giving weapons to the Communists to fight against us. They'll say that 
if we expatriates can't have a democratic election here, then how can we be 
responsible for a democratic election in Vietnam?" 
</P>
<P>
 Vo said he had gone onstage so he wouldn't appear a sore loser, but that he 
was dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if they had made their decisions . . . without discussion, which was not 
right, they still should have told me first instead of letting me find out 
along with everyone else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vu Hoang, a member of the election committee, said that organizers had wanted 
to hear comments from Vo, but that he had come 45 minutes late Saturday. Vo's 
supporters were allowed to speak at the end of the meeting but "it's not our 
fault if people were ready to leave and didn't listen to them," Hoang said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vo said he and other members of his ticket will meet and decide how to react 
to the election committee's action.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; ANCIENT DUMP TO BE DEVELOPED FOR PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 30-acre area of Fairview Park where archeologists have explored an ancient 
garbage dump will be graded, landscaped and opened to the public this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks Supt. David Alkema said the Fairview Park Citizens Advisory Committee 
will meet within the next few months to decide how to develop the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Alkema said plants and paths are likely, but ball fields and more active uses 
will probably not be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 The site is on a bluff overlooking the Santa Ana River. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 4,000 years ago, people came to the area to collect shellfish and hunt, 
said retired anthropology professor Keith Dixon, who began exploring the site 
in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon said he and his students at Cal State Fullerton spent many summers 
digging at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 They found mostly ancient trash -- broken stone tools, shells and rocks. The 
stone tools were used for grinding, cutting and scraping. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything that the ancient societies used was thrown in the garbage heap, 
Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Archeologists have done about all they can to study the site, Dixon said, and 
recommended that it be capped for protection. But if new techniques were 
developed, the site could be studied again, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon also said that archeologists want to focus their energy on sites that 
are in danger of being developed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fairview Park site is safe, he said, and can be set aside for later study. 
</P>
<P>
 The Keith Cos., which was hired by the city, has studied the site to find 
where the historically valuable garbage is located. 
</P>
<P>
 That area will be capped, and the artifacts discovered during the survey will 
be turned over to Dixon for safekeeping, the City Council decided last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also decided that anything found at the site should be stored at 
Cal State Fullerton until it can be displayed in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Alkema said the city has nowhere to show the ancient garbage, but he also said 
there may not be much there that people would want to see. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon agreed that the objects are not visually exciting but said they are 
valuable to scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 "By analyzing the trash, you learn an awful lot about people," Dixon said. 
"It's the most important source of information for archeologists." WILLSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; TRUSTEES TO ACT ON SCHOOL-CHOICE 
ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Getting a jump on other school systems, Capistrano Unified School District 
trustees are expected today to set in motion a program that will give parents 
the option of choosing which schools their children attend in the 1994-95 year. 
</P>
<P>
 The district began planning its program two years ago, long before the 
controversial school-voucher initiative, Proposition 174, was defeated in 
November, and before the Legislature mandated that all school districts 
implement school-choice policies by the 1995-96 year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have a substantial head start in doing the types of reforms the 
public wants from public schools," said district Supt. James A. Fleming. 
</P>
<P>
 The school-choice program will go hand-in-hand with the district's plans to 
have its 36 elementary, middle and high schools offer specialized programs 
intended to increase parents' and students' options. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's vote by trustees will establish guidelines for the school-choice 
program and is the first step in a six-week process that will involve parents 
in selecting schools for the 1994-95 year. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the district will send letters to parents describing the new 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, a catalogue outlining the offerings at various schools will be 
available for parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Meetings to brief parents, in English and Spanish, will also be held. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 4-5, all district schools will be open for visits. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on March 12, those parents who are seeking to transfer their children to 
new schools will be required to submit forms at one of the district's "choice 
centers." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the advantages of the formalized process is that district officials 
will get a handle on how many children may be moving from one school to another 
in the program's initial year, said board President Paul B. Haseman. 
</P>
<P>
 "This does complicate the use of our facilities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Thome, assistant superintendent for elementary school operations, said 
the district anticipates that most parents will continue sending their children 
to schools in the vicinity of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 A study the district conducted of similar programs in other states found that 
less than 10% of parents choose to move their children to schools outside their 
immediate areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "People generally tend to send their children to the same school that the 
neighborhood children attend," Thome said. 
</P>
<P>
 One factor that may persuade some parents to keep their children at schools 
near their homes is a district requirement that families must provide 
transportation to schools outside their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 In the event that requests to enroll students in a school exceed the school's 
capacity, the district has devised a list of criteria to determine which 
parents will be given priority. 
</P>
<P>
 That list will be voted on by trustees today. 
</P>
<P>
 Jolene Dougherty, principal of Ole Hanson Elementary, said principals and 
teachers are enthusiastic about the idea, because allowing parents the option 
to choose a school may increase parents' involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good for parents, good for students and good for schools," Dougherty 
said. RICHARD CORE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; ASTRONOMY PROGRAM GETS STELLAR MARKS

 Peering through a telescope for the first time, Betty Vang, 14, gasped as the 
moon, magnified 125 times, jumped into view. "Oh, it's so cool! It's so big!" 
she exclaimed as she squinted into the eyepiece on a recent weekday night. 
</P>
<P>
 As dozens of other students jostled for their turn, Betty added, "It looked 
like a big piece of Swiss cheese, but there's more holes in the moon." 
</P>
<P>
 She was one of about 100 students and parents who attended a special program 
at James Irvine Intermediate School designed to involve parents in school 
activities and their children's education. 
</P>
<P>
 During the hourlong program, Bruce Crowe, a member of the Orange County 
Astronomers Society, showed color slides of the planets and their moons, which 
were taken by the NASA probe Voyager. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing the planets, Crowe pointed out that not all of them have rocky 
surfaces like Mars and Venus. For example, Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune 
are composed of gas. 
</P>
<P>
 He also showed slides of Halley's Comet and told the audience that comets are 
essentially dirty balls of gas and ice. As they approach the sun, they shed 
minute particles that can form tails millions of miles long that can be seen 
from the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could take a comet's tail, stretched over millions of miles, and pack it 
up into a suitcase and walk away with it. That's how thin it is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, members of the audience lined up for a close-up view of the bright 
half-moon overhead. Through the 10-inch reflector telescope, the countless 
craters that mottled the moon's gray and white surface were easily visible. 
Shadows that spilled across the moonscape made ridges and craters stand out in 
sharp relief, offering an almost three-dimensional image. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowe also aimed the telescope at the constellation Orion, providing a view of 
a small cluster of stars as well as a nebula, a wispy halo of interstellar gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and students alike praised the program, saying that it generates 
interest in learning outside the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great for students to come here and see things like that," said Hector 
Hernandez, 38. "It's good. I found out that the planets are not like Earth and 
that they're made of gas. They've got moons and rings and stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fun. I got to see the moon up close. It looked like a mountain with a 
lot of holes," said Jose Alba, 12. Learning about the stars by using a 
telescope, instead of learning facts through a textbook, "makes it more fun," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience left Betty a little philosophical. With a glance toward the 
stars twinkling overhead, she said: "Maybe someone's looking at us too." JON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA; JUDGE TO RULE ON CITY DENIAL OF CONVERSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge is expected to decide Wednesday whether city officials improperly 
denied Iraj Mahdavi's plan to convert a 22-unit apartment complex into 
condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, Orange County Superior Court Judge James L. Smith ordered the 
city to reconsider its rejection of the conversion, saying the city's position 
that the plan would reduce the stock of affordable housing was insufficient to 
deny the project. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members again denied the request in October, this time saying the 
market for condominiums had dried up. "If it were my kids, I'd tell them to buy 
a single-family house," Councilman Michael L. Maertzweiler said at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members also questioned Mahdavi's claim that several of his 
current tenants in the complex are interested in buying their units. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't heard one word on how they will qualify" for mortgage loans, 
Councilman Norman Z. Eckenrode said. "I don't feel all of them will qualify."  
</P>
<P>
 Mahdavi said he hopes to sell the two- and three-bedroom units at The Gables 
for $120,000 to $135,000. He has offered purchase assistance to those tenants 
who want to buy and relocation assistance to tenants who leave. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge must now decide whether the city's reasons for rejecting the project 
are adequate. The plan meets city codes for condominium conversion and was 
approved twice by the city's Planning Commission. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; POLICY ON TEACHERS' CHILDREN ATTACKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lori Powell wants her children to go to school in the same place where she 
teaches. Her only problem is that the Cypress School District, which is her 
employer, won't allow it. 
</P>
<P>
 She is determined to change the district's policy, though she failed in her 
first attempt to do so earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell and a number of colleagues were turned down Jan. 11 when they asked 
school board members to temporarily allow their children to attend the 
elementary schools where they work. Board members voted against the one-year 
test, 3 to 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not giving up," Powell said, adding that she plans to rally support 
from the community and other teachers to pressure the district into erasing the 
policy, which prohibits teachers and other employees from working at their 
children's schools. 
</P>
<P>
 School Board President Donna McDougall and members Ellen Friedmann and Donna 
Erickson, who voted against the teachers' proposal, said they fear problems 
could be created for colleagues of teachers whose children go to the teachers' 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is the only one in the county that bars teachers from working at 
the schools their children attend, said trustee Ventura Cornejo Jr., who cast a 
dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there are any problems," said Cornejo, who has grandchildren in 
the district's schools. "I would really like to abolish the policy altogether." 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed out that Supt. William D. Eller has a son attending a school in the 
district, and that board members' children have attended the schools in the 
past without creating any problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the policy was drafted in 1971, teachers were having problems, 
according to Mary Lee, a 28-year district teacher and president of the Cypress 
Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 To find out how many teachers were satisfied with the policy, the association 
sent out surveys to the district's 203 teachers and 135 classified employees 
earlier this month, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 The response was overwhelmingly in favor of the district's policy. Those 
dissatisfied with the policy were outnumbered 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "They like it the way it is," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a good kid in your peer's classroom, there's no problem; but if 
you have a less than good kid, then it's a very uncomfortable situation," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said problem students require that teachers hold conferences with their 
parents and if the parent is a fellow teacher, things could get tense. Having 
to tell a peer "something negative about their child can make friends enemies." 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot remove people's emotions," she said. "A parent is a very 
protective person no matter how professional you want to be. . . . I can say my 
kid's lousy, but you can't say my kid is lousy." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 She conceded that problems could arise but said that teachers can handle them 
in a professional manner. And the benefits of having children study at the 
schools where their parents teach far outweigh the possible conflicts, Powell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Abolishing the policy "would give me the opportunity to more fully participate 
in my child's education," she said. "Children whose parents are involved in 
their lives become more successful in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell plans to spread her views among her colleagues in hope of persuading 
them to change their opinions before she again presents her case before the 
school board within months. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; COUNCIL TO DISCUSS CHANGING 2 FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday will consider proposals to increase fees for one 
senior citizens program and decrease fees for adult soccer leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the Anaheim Police Assn., the union for the city's rank-and-file 
officers, is planning to picket City Hall for the third time during the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The seniors fee the council is being asked to increase is for older residents 
who are left at a city facility for the day while receiving various physical 
and mental therapies. The new fee would be $20 a day, up from $15. The fee 
would be raised to $25 within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Jarvi, the parks and recreation director, said the increase is necessary 
to make the program self-supporting because the city can no longer afford the 
annual $117,000 subsidy it provides. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarvi said the soccer fee decrease was asked for by the players, who agreed to 
accept a lesser level of service from the city. The new fee will be $525 per 
team, instead of $613. In return, the players will not receive trophies for 
second place, officials will get less training and the fields will not be 
prepared as thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up until recently, we had always subsidized adult sports, but when we 
couldn't do that anymore, we raised the fees," Jarvi said. "But the soccer 
teams thought the new fees were too high, so we came to an agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Police association officials said they are again expecting 400 officers, 
family members and supporters to picket the meeting, as they did twice last 
fall. The association, which has been working without a labor contract since 
1992 and without a raise since 1991, staged a "blue flu" work stoppage last 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting begins at 5 p.m. at City Hall, 200 S. Anaheim Blvd. TERRY SPENCER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; COUNCIL OKS MOST OF PLAN FOR CENTRAL 
PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a blueprint for development of Huntington 
Central Park that includes a nine-hole golf course, a 15-acre fishing and 
boating lake, a 40-acre "urban forest" and additional picnicking areas and 
walking trails. 
</P>
<P>
 The approval of the master plan for the 370-acre park also will allow 
Huntington Beach police officers to continue operating a public gun range that 
has stirred some concern about noise and safety. 
</P>
<P>
 There also will be a therapeutic riding facility for disabled people in a 
corner of the equestrian park. 
</P>
<P>
 Deleted from the master plan last week was a youth sports center complex that 
had been recommended for the park, south of Talbert Avenue, across from Central 
Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the land, a former dump site, has been found to be unstable and 
unsuitable for the sports center, which includes a swimming pool, a gymnasium 
and ball fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they are seeking an alternative site for the complex on Ocean 
View School District property adjacent to Murdy Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Services Director Ron Hagan said the park improvements, excluding 
the sports complex, will cost about $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 However, concessionaires are expected to develop the golf course and lake 
facilities at their expense. State bond revenue will finance some projects, 
Hagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The developments, because they will occur on parkland and cost more than 
$100,000, will have to be put to a citywide vote, probably in November, 1995, 
Hagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The golf course would feature chaparral and other native plants in the 
fairways to offer a natural setting, while turf would be planted at the tee 
boxes, landing areas and greens. 
</P>
<P>
 The urban forest would be located on a hilly area near Ellis Avenue and 
Edwards Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Separate sycamore, oak, eucalyptus and pine groves are planned to make up for 
asphalt areas in a growing city, Hagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Ralph Bauer, Grace Winchell and David Sullivan voted against 
the master plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan said later that the golf course would take up "too big a chunk of 
land," about 20 acres, and could only be used by golfers. ROBERT BARKER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; SCHOOLS REPORT ON ETHNIC MAKEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Alamitos Unified School District's student population remains 
predominantly white, although the percentage has dipped for the third straight 
year as the number of Latino students continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Whites comprise 76% of the student population, down by 1% from the last school 
year and 3% from the 1991-92 school year, according to statistics released by 
the school district last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollment by Latino students increased from 9% two years ago to 11% for the 
current school year, but there was hardly any change in enrollment among 
blacks, Asians, Native Americans and Filipinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Supt. David Hatton, who presented the figures during the school 
board meeting Tuesday, said the enrollment reflects the ethnic makeup of the 
communities that the school district serves. 
</P>
<P>
 The district serves Los Alamitos, Rossmoor and Seal Beach, which have mostly 
white residents, Hatton said. 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires that the school district survey its schools every year to 
ensure there is ethnic balance and no concentration of students from just one 
ethnic group in certain schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hatton said the schools do not have quotas or prescribed percentages from 
ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 7,414 students enrolled in the district's five elementary schools, 
one middle school, one continuation high school and one high school. During the 
past three years, enrollment has increased by more than 800 students, Hatton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the new students are transfers from other school districts, and 
half are from families who recently moved into the area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asians comprise 7% of the student population, Pacific Islanders 1%, Filipinos 
1% and blacks 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, 49.2% of students are white, 34.3% are Latino, 12.4% are 
Asian, 2.2% are black, 1% are Filipino, 0.5% are Pacific Islanders and 0.5% are 
Native American. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY EXPECTED TO OK PIER RESTAURANT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday is expected to approve spending $1.3 million to 
construct a two-story restaurant at the end of the city pier, which will become 
the home of a Ruby's restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also had planned to build a new lifeguard tower, snack shop, bait 
and tackle shop and restrooms on the pier, but those plans were put on hold 
because costs were projected to be 30% higher than initial estimates, said Ron 
Hagan, director of the Community Services Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Costs for the entire project had soared to $2.1 million from $1.3 million, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials put a top priority on the Ruby's restaurant because it will pay 
about $160,000 a year in rent and profit-sharing with the city, Hagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce costs, the original building plans were scaled back, including 
replacing a copper roof and sheet marble exteriors with stucco walls and a tile 
roof, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say they want to construct the remaining accommodations within three 
to five years but do not know how the city would pay for it. ROBERT BARKER

LAGUNA HILLS TO HONOR GRAFFITI FIGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CORE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Jorden was fed up with repeatedly seeing graffiti scarring the outside 
wall of the tire store where he works. 
</P>
<P>
 Time after time, crews hired by the city were called in to remove the 
spray-painted letters and slogans that taggers left behind. It seemed the cycle 
of vandalism and cleanup would never end. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Jorden took the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the City Council will recognize Jorden for aiding in the arrest of 
two teen-age boys he caught spray-painting their monikers on the tire store's 
wall. The council will also consider a staff recommendation that Jorden, 21, be 
given a certificate and awarded $750 for his efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate taggers," said Jorden, who estimated the store had been hit by taggers 
25 times in six months. "There's no purpose for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jorden nabbed the two teens Nov. 26. On that Friday night, he sat across the 
street from the store and waited, as he had done twice before. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10:30 p.m., he saw eight teens approach the building and climb onto its 
roof. He went after them, climbing up just as two boys bent over the edge and 
sprayed the top of the wall. Other members of the group ran away. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorden, who said he also works as an armed security guard, detained the two, 
taking them to a nearby restaurant where he called the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Lt. Tom McCarthy, the city's chief of police services, said Jorden's 
action deterred other graffiti vandals, who had made the store wall a favorite 
target because it is visible from nearby Interstate 5, giving the graffiti 
maximum exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where this particular incident occurred has probably been one of the top 
places in the city for taggers to go after," McCarthy said. "When that arrest 
was made, it really quieted down there." 
</P>
<P>
 Jorden is the third person to be recommended for a certificate and reward in 
conjunction with a year-old city ordinance that cracks down on graffiti vandals 
and offers rewards up to $1,000 for the arrest of taggers. The two previous 
recipients, who were given $150, asked to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 The city ordinance also contains provisions for the prompt removal of graffiti 
from publicly visible surfaces.  
</P>
<P>
 Dave Lewis, the director of the city's Parks and Recreation Department who 
oversees the graffiti abatement program, said the city spent about $15,000 last 
year to have a private contractor paint over or remove the spray-painted 
markings. The city responded to about 80 acts of graffiti vandalism last year, 
Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy said sheriff's deputies in 1993 arrested 10 people, all juveniles, 
for graffiti vandalism, including the two caught by Jorden. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, after Jorden's efforts are recognized, the council is scheduled to 
consider strengthening the graffiti ordinance by making it illegal for a person 
to possess "graffiti implements," such as spray-paint cans or paint sticks, in 
parks, playgrounds, recreational facilities and the public right-of-way. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will also consider requiring businesses selling implements that 
can be used for graffiti to store them in locked areas.
