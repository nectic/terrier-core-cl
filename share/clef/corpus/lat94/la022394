LONG-TERM HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It would be very shortsighted for the Clinton Administration to trim costs 
in the health care package by eliminating coverage for long-term care ("Cuts in 
Health Plan Sought After Big Deficit Prediction," Feb. 10) when, in fact, 
long-term care facilities provide quality health care at a cost-effective 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, subacute care in a traditional hospital setting can run from 
$900 to $2,200 a day, compared with $250 to $500 a day in a nursing facility. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, long-term care facilities play an active role in short-term 
rehabilitation for people of all ages with serious injuries or chronic 
illnesses. And they are the most economical choice when a person needs 
intensive rehabilitation, 24 hours of nursing supervision or lacks a care-giver 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
 A licensed nursing facility costs an average of $86 a day, which can be less 
than the cost of one visit from a home health professional. Studies have shown 
that home care will actually add to -- not reduce -- overall long-term care 
costs. The Clinton Administration's health care reform plan should not attempt 
to sell home care as the cure for long-term care cost containment, as both 
modes of care serve entirely different populations.

ELECTRIC CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your editorial of Feb. 6 ("Recharging the Electric Idea") overstated 
sentiment for the electric car among Northeast states making up the Ozone 
Transport Region. The vote was nine to four to petition EPA for a low-emission 
vehicle program similar to California's.The vote specifically excluded an 
electric car mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the four states voting against the California program (even without the 
electric car mandate), add at least two others that demanded deletion of an 
electric car mandate before voting yes, and you get a much clearer picture of 
where the Northeast stands on the practicality of an electric car over the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 With respect to the California LEV program, note, too, that only four states 
in the OTC region commissioned independent studies on the subject, and all four 
studies concluded there were better and less costly alternatives to the 
California program for those states. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA ought to give serious consideration to these studies as it weighs the 
OTC petition. The EPA may also consider an alternative car proposed by the auto 
makers, one that seriously addresses air quality in the Northeast, but at far 
less cost to the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without an electric car requirement, a costly program designed for 
California to deal with its unique problem should not be forced on states on 
the other side of the country.

INSTALLING LINCHPINS OF REFORM; OMBUDSMAN, REVIEW PANEL WILL OVERSEE COMPLAINTS 
AGAINST SHERIFF'S DEPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and the Sheriff's Department are 
about to take another critical step toward police reform in Los Angeles, with 
their selection of an independent county ombudsman and five-member police 
review panel. Both positions are being created to handle citizen complaints 
against Sheriff's Department personnel. Both positions will play a critical 
role in shaping future police-community relations in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The ombudsman and the review panel, composed of retired judges, are important 
parts of the recommendations put forth in the report of the commission chaired 
by Judge James G. Kolts in 1992. That report followed an exhaustive seven-month 
investigation into a number of controversial shootings and found disturbing 
evidence of excessive force and lax discipline within the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Sheriff Sherman Block has started the reform process by upgrading 
departmental standards and training procedures -- changes noted approvingly in 
the most recent six-month progress report, issued last October, by commission 
special counsel Merrick J. Bobb. Another report is due in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that report is issued, the next step -- a system to handle citizen 
complaints thoroughly and expeditiously -- should be in place. That includes 
the county ombudsman, with the power to make inquiries into the progress or 
result of a particular investigation and, if needed, ask for a review by the 
judges' panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The four finalists for ombudsman include three Californians, two with 
law-enforcement backgrounds, and an out-of-stater with previous experience as 
an ombudsman. The candidates reflect the region's diversity and include African 
American and Latino men and a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors and the sheriff should keep in mind that whoever is chosen 
must be able to work comfortably with our highly diverse community. Both the 
ombudsman and the review panel should, if they have the authority they need, 
bolster the public's faith in a Sheriff's Department that needs to stay on the 
road to restored credibility.

THIS TIME, IT'S GOING TO WORK!; I-10 CAR-POOL LANES WERE REVILED IN 1976, BUT 
NOW WE HAVE TO TRY HARDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Will Los Angeles reinvent itself? Does this city truly have a brighter future 
in the wake of the many tragedies that have rocked it? A future with less 
congestion and smog? The first inklings may be coming from, no surprise, our 
freeway system, long the butt of too many bad jokes and far too much 
L.A.-bashing.  
</P>
<P>
 Discussions are still in the early stages but U.S. Transportation Secretary 
Federico Pena, Mayor Richard Riordan and other city and state officials are 
talking about making permanent the temporary car-pool lane along the Santa 
Monica Freeway.The final decision, which will follow formal community surveys 
and environmental impact studies, is up to Caltrans, the state transportation 
agency. We think it's a good idea that could spark many other positive changes. 
</P>
<P>
 After the recent earthquake, transportation officials opened emergency 
car-pool lanes that give car-poolers an advantage in bypassing damaged areas on 
the Santa Monica Freeway and the Golden State-Antelope Valley freeway 
interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, car-pool lanes have almost been a local epithet. In 1976, Caltrans 
unveiled a short-lived diamond lane along the Santa Monica Freeway for buses 
and vehicles carrying at least three people. The lane was created from one of 
the freeway's existing lanes. And even though traffic flowed smoothly in that 
lane, solo drivers in other lanes crept along -- and cursed. The infamous 
experiment lasted only 21 weeks and left a bitter legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new, makeshift car-pool lanes -- requiring two, not three, occupants 
per vehicle -- are beginning to pry some solo drivers out of their cars. After 
being in place for the months of freeway reconstruction they could, in 
combination with a new push on telecommuting, for example, change life here for 
the better.

TAX HIKE FOR QUAKE REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "Let's Do Our Part, Don't Shirk," editorial, Feb. 10: 
</P>
<P>
 While I agree that we should do our part, we have been led down this path once 
before. After the Loma Prieta quake a tax hike was approved for a limited 
period to help cover costs. As expected, at the end of the term this tax was 
extended without hesitation. If we impose a new tax to cover costs resulting 
from the latest quake, you can bet that the same thing will happen.  
</P>
<P>
 Although our sales tax is extremely high already, we should just accept the 
fact that such a fund will be required on a recurring basis and put a permanent 
tax in place. Rather than being in a reactive mode, scrambling to raise funds, 
the money would be there waiting in the event of a declared disaster. It should 
not be accessible for any other purpose at any time by anyone. A permanent 
disaster relief fund seems to be long overdue.

 * The Times' editorial support of an increase in our already excessive sales 
and gasoline taxes is nothing more than consumer rape. This plan to pay for 
quake damage, rather than by a bond issue (editorial, Feb. 12), is misplaced. 
Consumer taxes are the most regressive and oppressive of taxes. They fall 
hardest on low- and middle-income taxpayers. They hit business hard by 
depriving prospective buyers of available funds for purchasing. They are not 
temporary since, once imposed as an "emergency proposition," they are rarely 
removed.

 * I feel that I and thousands of other Californians are already doing our part 
by paying property taxes that are three, four and more times higher than the 
taxes of those who bought their homes before Proposition 13 was passed. Because 
of this, the idea of an increase in the gas tax or sales tax is absolutely 
repugnant to me, but I'm willing to accept either one as a temporary measure in 
order to help restore the normalcy of life that was so disrupted by the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a good time to rethink the entire concept of Proposition 13. Changes 
are needed, not only to make property taxes more equitable, but perhaps more 
important, to bring about a more reliable source of revenue for the state so it 
can better handle future natural disasters as well as the present growing 
disaster of insufficient funding of our schools, libraries, police and fire 
departments, etc.

<P>
 * I have worked closely with Federal Emergency Management Agency Director 
James Lee Witt, members of the Clinton Cabinet and other federal officials in 
the month following the earthquake. They have shown great interest in assisting 
the recovery of Los Angeles, and all Californians appreciate their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 However, earthquakes are, fundamentally, local and state events. The most 
immediate and important decisions in response to an earthquake are made by 
local governments in cooperation with the state and, when necessary, the 
federal government. To suggest, as The Times does ("Washington First, Now 
Sacramento," editorial, Feb. 15), that Gov. Pete Wilson is acting after the 
Clinton Administration has acted is to portray the situation exactly backward. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's response has been immediate and substantial, and it anticipated 
federal involvement. On Jan. 17, within hours, Wilson flew to Southern 
California to personally take charge of the state response. Local officials in 
Los Angeles and Ventura counties immediately activated the state's mutual aid 
system providing essential firefighting, law enforcement and emergency 
assistance.  
</P>
<P>
 Within days, Wilson took more than a dozen major actions to expedite the 
delivery of emergency supplies to the region. He waived rules and regulations 
that enabled the Los Angeles freeway system to be rebuilt in a matter of months 
instead of years. He quickly ordered temporary schoolrooms to the region and 
put together a group of high-level housing officials to ensure that people have 
the opportunity to rebuild their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 As the emergency phase of the response passed, it was necessary to address the 
cost of the recovery and the program necessary to pay for it. Unlike others, 
Wilson sought the best estimate of the cost before choosing a strategy to meet 
it. His Administration estimated the total cost to be between $13 billion and 
$20 billion. The governor determined that the state would directly pay 
approximately $1.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to the suggestions that the state pursue additional taxes in a manner 
similar to that following the Loma Prieta earthquake, Wilson put forward a plan 
to shoulder these costs through a combination of means -- primarily general 
obligation bonds -- rather than by raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 A quick comparison of the economic situations in 1989 and in 1994 makes a very 
strong case for this approach. In 1989, the California sales tax was 6%; it is 
now 7.25% statewide. The gasoline tax was 18 cents per gallon; it is now 36.4 
cents per gallon. The weighted average interest rate on general obligation 
bonds was 6.84%; it is now 5.23%. The amount of taxable Social Security over 
the threshold was 50% in 1989; it is now 85%. And the unemployment rate was 
5.1%; it is now 9.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians must not be taxed out of the recovery that is beginning. The 
current economic climate and the fiscal constraints on the state budget make 
additional taxes to fund the recovery an undesirable alternative. Bonds should 
be the primary long-term financing tool used to rebuild Los Angeles.

NEED FOR RAIL SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * If the freeway overpasses had been strengthened, as they should have been, 
we would be unaware of the benefits of rail transportation.Perhaps this recent 
earthquake was a blessing in disguise. Now we all realize how much we need rail 
transportation and how it mitigated our transportation needs with the freeways 
that are now unusable. For the year or so before the freeways can be rebuilt, 
we can rejoice that someone had the foresight to initiate this rail service. 
What would we do without it?

PERSPECTIVES ON BOSNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 HEAD. . . Clearly Upset at NATO'S RoleRussia is understandably concerned about 
its traditional sphere of influence falling under Western dominance.BENJAMIN 
SCHWARZ Benjamin Schwarz is a foreign-policy analyst in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's reaction to the threatened air strikes in Bosnia clearly shows the 
dangers inherent in NATO's intrusion in regions within Russia's historical area 
of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers have argued that President Boris N. Yeltsin opposed NATO's move 
to avoid being accused by Russia's nationalists of caving in to the United 
States. This argument assumes that only "extremist" Russians were troubled by 
the prospect of NATO military action. But across the Russian political 
spectrum, NATO's threat was genuinely viewed as dangerous and hostile. From the 
Russian perspective, this is understandable.  
</P>
<P>
 NATO, after all, was formed as a defensive alliance to repel a military attack 
on its member states. But in Bosnia, NATO has radically extended its writ by 
threatening intervention in a state unconnected to the alliance. Furthermore, 
NATO ostensibly was formed as an alliance hostile to the Communist Soviet 
Union; with the collapse of the Soviet state, many Russians wonder why NATO is 
needed. Surely, they argue, Western Europe can provide for its own diminished 
security needs through the European Union and no longer needs an organization 
run by a superpower across the Atlantic.  
</P>
<P>
 Taking into account these considerations, along with recent U.S. policy 
initiatives to absorb into NATO the east-central European states, one need not 
be a Russian "extremist" to understand why Yeltsin, in opposing NATO air 
strikes, stated that he was troubled by signs that NATO wished "to pursue 
designs of dominance." 
</P>
<P>
 For good reason, Russians worry that an American-led NATO with expanded 
geographical responsibilities would present Russia with an intimidating 
presence, giving it little choice but to go along with the alliance's policy 
preferences -- even if Russian leaders believed those to be contrary to 
Russia's best interests. 
</P>
<P>
 By its words and deeds in Bosnia, Russia has put the United States on notice 
that Moscow will regard with great suspicion any unilateral attempts by NATO to 
impose its will in those regions of Europe where Russia has traditionally 
strong ties. But Washington myopically assumes that if the United States 
regards NATO's actions as benign attempts to promote stability in Eastern 
Europe, Russia has an obligation to view matters the same way. Any deviation 
from that perspective is to U.S. policy-makers evidence of faulty thinking or 
worse, evil intent. While Americans need not believe Russians' suspicions to be 
justified, they must recognize them as understandable.

PERSPECTIVES ON BOSNIA; RUSSIA STEPS INTO THE FRAY . . . ; WHILE THE WEST IS 
RIGHT TO BE WARY, A BALKAN SETTLEMENT THAT INCLUDES MOSCOW HAS A BETTER CHANCE 
OF ENDURING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAM E. FULLER, Graham E. Fuller is a senior political scientist at RAND 
and author of The Democracy Trap: Perils of the Post Cold War World (Dutton, 
1991). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While the West paid almost no attention, Balkan politics underwent a major 
shift of terrain last week: Russia has just weighed in for the first time on 
the Bosnian fray, an event laden with implications for the future of NATO 
policy, Russia's world role and Russian internal politics. 
</P>
<P>
 First, while NATO and Washington express pleasure that "their" Bosnian policy 
is beginning to work -- with the Serbs' apparent pullback from their brutal 
siege of Sarajevo -- it is in fact due to the Russians that such an event has 
come about. The Russians have overnight become a key player in the politics of 
the former Yugoslavia, where they had been shut out ever since the end of World 
War II.  
</P>
<P>
 Russia is the first external player to have any clout with the Serbs, so its 
role could well fill a gap in a useful way. To those deeply suspicious of 
Russian imperial intentions, however, this is bad news, for it could indicate 
that the Russian bear has now "extended its claws" into Eastern Europe for the 
first time since the fall of the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
 It is vastly premature, however, to make any call about "the Russian bear." 
While Russian democracy is far from perfect and Russia is indeed in economic 
turmoil, there is no real evidence of reversion to the old Cold War ideological 
split or a Russian challenge to the West in the old sense. There are wild 
imperialists in Russia -- Vladimir Zhirinovsky being the most flagrant example. 
But Russia is a great power, and it will certainly have great-power interests 
in its neighborhood and beyond. The question is, what kind of a Russia will it 
be? Will its motivations be reasonably compatible with those of the West? So 
far, these interests of Russia cannot be described as incompatible, even in 
NATO and Washington eyes. That could change, however, if Russian politics 
should lurch into ultra-nationalist visions and authoritarian methods. 
</P>
<P>
 Boris N. Yeltsin has probably strengthened his domestic position by this 
stunning decision to weigh in on Bosnia. He has been under pressure from the 
right to go beyond simple pursuit of "me-tooism" policies that agree with the 
West on all major issues. He has probably restored some element of Russian 
pride. Many Russians -- hardly all of them zealots -- believe that Russia 
should have elements of an "independent" foreign policy, based on its own 
unique interests.  
</P>
<P>
 But what are those interests? Serbia shares with Russia both Eastern Orthodox 
Christianity and a Slav tradition -- although Croats and Bosnians are Slavs, 
too. Is this enough? Is Serbia really of critical interest to Russia? Can 
Serbia outweigh economic interests or relations with Germany or good economic 
ties with the Czechs and Hungarians? Does Russia merely want to champion a 
client, or to play a broader and more constructive game in the region?  
</P>
<P>
 The likely answer is that Russia still is casting about in foreign-policy 
confusion following the collapse of its empire and finds that this is at least 
one area where it still has clout. Russians want to be perceived as a 
significant player -- and they can now do so for the first time in East 
European politics.  
</P>
<P>
 Washington and NATO have thus been delivered a fait accompli in Bosnia. 
Russia's role may be positive; done right, Russian activism in Bosnia and the 
Security Council could be constructive. A Balkan settlement that includes 
Russia may be harder to reach, but it may also be more enduring if Russia can 
influence the key players, the Serbs, and as long as Moscow's purpose is not 
simply to blindly check Western policies.  
</P>
<P>
 We are likely to see significant other new departures in Russian foreign 
policy, gradually revealing the face of the new Russia -- and, it is hoped, 
demonstrating policies different from those during the Cold War. These 
developments do not have to be bad news for the West, but the West will not be 
wrong in feeling ambivalence about this important event.

DON'T CLOSE THE DOOR TO GENUINE REFUGEES; ASYLUM: REFORM IS NEEDED, BUT THE 
ADMINISTRATION PLAN WOULD BEEF UP ENFORCEMENT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE TRULY 
NEEDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights based in New York.

 The U.S. asylum system is in trouble. But rather than focus on ways of 
improving it that will benefit genuine refugees, the Clinton Administration has 
announced significant new restrictions that may deny protection to such 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno and Immigration and Naturalization 
Service Commissioner Doris Meissner announced a two-year strategy to curb 
unauthorized immigration. The plan calls for the expenditure of more than $300 
million to deploy more than 1,000 Border Patrol agents in California and Texas, 
expedite the removal of criminal aliens, strengthen the enforcement of 
sanctions on employers who hire aliens not authorized to work and make access 
to asylum more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Asylum reform is to be specifically accomplished by charging at least a $130 
filing fee, withholding work permission for for six months, linking the asylum 
process to formal deportation hearings, streamlining procedures and doubling 
the number of immigration officers and judges who handle claims. The priority 
is enforcement at the expense of genuine refugees. This emphasis on 
enforcement, however, raises basic questions about whether the INS should 
continue to have responsibilities for the asylum program. 
</P>
<P>
 What this plan ignores is that refugees are not illegal immigrants. Nor does 
our law treat them as such -- on its face. Refugees flee political, religious 
and ethnic oppression by regimes whose values are often antithetical to those 
of modern democracies. They generally turn to the closest safe haven they can 
reach. Of the world's 18 million refugees, most are in Africa and Asia. 
Relatively few make their way to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 There is indeed an asylum crisis here, but it is mainly a lack of commitment 
by the authorities. The Refugee Act of 1980 required the attorney general to 
establish an asylum procedure to protect those refugees with a well-founded 
fear of persecution in their home countries who made their way to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 But the interim system established in 1980 was illusory. Only in 1991 was a 
permanent system established with a corps of professional INS asylum officers 
to decide claims. But inadequate implementation destined the new system to be 
overwhelmed. INS was able to complete only 34,513 of the 150,386 claims it 
received in fiscal year 1993; projections for 1994 are not much more comforting 
-- only 10,836 of the 36,808 claims received in the first three months of 1994 
were completed. By October of this year, 150 asylum officers will face a 
backlog of more than 450,000 claims. These meager resources are dwarfed by the 
size of staffs devoted to asylum adjudication in Sweden (800), the Netherlands 
(750) and France (600), which have only a fraction of the claimants. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's plans for asylum are steeped in enforcement priorities 
and pose threats to genuine refugees. Unduly high filing fees will deny access 
to refugees seeking asylum, particularly since any fee-waiver provision will be 
implemented by an agency notoriously insensitive to such financial provisions. 
The categorical six-month ban on asylum applicants receiving employment 
authorization will undoubtedly victimize many genuine refugees who will have 
difficulties sustaining themselves here. This is so, particularly in light of 
the announced enhancement to the employer sanctions provisions. The 
Administration is telling bona fide refugees, "We welcome you to our shores, 
but only if you can survive without a legal way to secure food, clothing and 
shelter." 
</P>
<P>
 The time has come for true asylum reform. Specifically, a single office should 
be established within the Department of Justice and made responsible for all 
phases of asylum decision-making -- screening, formal status determinations and 
appeals. This office should be separate from the INS and the immigration court. 
In this manner, the humanitarian responsibilities associated with refugees 
would be divorced from immigration enforcement functions to the greatest extent 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 This unitary asylum model brings other desirable benefits. The single office 
would avoid the considerable delays currently caused by bureaucratic 
complications, such as file transfers. Specialization throughout the system 
would enhance productivity. Moreover, the estimated expenditures necessary to 
fund this system would be no more than the $64 million projected for the 
attorney general's planned asylum adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's announced strategy does an injustice to legitimate 
refugees. These people come to the United States at the most vulnerable time in 
their lives. Certainly, our system must separate out those who are not genuine. 
But we should not punish the true refugees in this delicate exercise. We should 
treat those fleeing persecution with the dignity they deserve and without 
compromising their human rights any further.

BLOOD BROTHERS AND SISTERS; A SIMPLE PINPRICK CAN SAVE A LIFE. IT'S CRITICAL 
FOR MORE AFRICAN AMERICANS TO BE LISTED ON DONOR REGISTRIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN GRIGSBY BATES, Karen Grigsby Bates writes from Los Angeles about 
modern culture, race relations and politics for several national publications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charlene Drew Jarvis is the daughter of pioneer physician Charles R. Drew, and 
she is dismayed. Her father developed the method by which blood plasma is 
stored and saved, enabling hospitals to keep standing blood supplies. Scores of 
us learned in elementary school that he died of injuries sustained in an 
automobile crash and exacerbated because the hospitals near the accident, in 
rural North Carolina, refused to take him in. Drew was an African American. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a good story, his daughter acknowledges, one that's saturated with irony: 
The black man who created the blood bank dies from lack of a transfusion, 
thanks to white racism. Except that it's not true. Drew died in the hospital 
emergency room despite the prompt medical attention he received. And Jarvis is 
distressed because the myth of her father's death is a barrier to encouraging 
more African Americans to consider donating blood, bone marrow and organs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarvis, a board member of the American Red Cross, has been crisscrossing the 
country trying to set the record straight and urge African Americans to give 
blood and submit to the simple pinprick that would get them listed in national 
donor registries. But she has encountered considerable reluctance. 
</P>
<P>
 That hesitation is not illogical. People think of the notorious experiment 
that began in the 1930s, in which black men in Tuskegee, Ala., clinics were 
surreptitiously injected with live syphilis virus so that the Army could study 
the disease. And of the most recent admission by the Department of Energy that 
bits of radioactive plutonium were injected into patients of all races without 
their knowledge.  
</P>
<P>
 But the need for donors in our community is critical. Persons of African 
descent, for example, almost exclusively are affected by sickle-cell anemia. 
These patients "have and need a rare blood property, and it can only come from 
African Americans," says Red Cross spokesman Felix Perez.  
</P>
<P>
 And despite what some skeptics may think, there is no A-list for receiving 
blood: "Blood is a public resource," Perez notes, "and it goes to anyone who 
needs it." Last year, the Rare Blood Donor Registry distributed nearly 1,700 
life-saving units -- almost 25% of which went to sickle-cell patients. Clearly, 
if more people donated, more people could be helped. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, says Dr. Reed Tuckson, president of Charles R. Drew University of 
Medicine in Los Angeles, the low donor numbers among African Americans indicate 
a need for public education. "It's particularly important for us, because of 
the violence and trauma that challenge our community," he says. "We have a 
fundamental responsibility to give this gift of life." 
</P>
<P>
 He has an ally in Cal Davis, who, like Charlene Jarvis, began his mission 
based on an intensely personal catalyst. Davis' wife Judie died of leukemia 
last year because a suitable bone-marrow donor could not be found in the 
National Marrow Donor Program. Because marrow is so genetically and racially 
specific, finding a compatible donor is a long shot anyway, but the odds become 
even more steep if one's donor pool is small. And as recently as two years ago, 
it was infinitesimal for African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Having been made painfully aware of the paucity of donors, the Davises 
established the Judie Davis Marrow Donor Recruitment Program to encourage 
minority members to donate. "All it takes is a blood sample," Davis says, "but 
giving that sample is like registering to vote: It puts you in position to cast 
your ballot later on, if necessary." In fact, most people who give samples and 
are typed are never called on to donate marrow, but for African Americans and 
other minorities, having such tiny donor pools from which to choose lowers the 
odds that much more. (Thanks to Davis, the number of African Americans 
registered has swelled from 200 to 61,000.) 
</P>
<P>
 Jarvis, Tuckson and Davis agree that it is critical for more African Americans 
to become involved in helping us save our own lives. "I'd like my father's 
long-term legacy to be one of saving lives and encouraging others to do the 
same," Jarvis says. And as Davis notes, giving blood or becoming a potential 
marrow donor comes with an extraordinary fringe benefit: "You're putting 
yourself in the position to save somebody's life during your lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 To donate blood, contact your local Red Cross. To find out more about 
bone-marrow donation, call the Judie Davis marrow donor program: (800) 
628-1413.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: UNDOCUMENTED, NOT UNDOCTORED

 They swarm across the border like fecund rats off a sinking ship, streaming 
north into a foreign land to give birth in hospitals that are clean and safe. 
They pay nothing for the privilege of parturition in a country with a 
sophisticated medical establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 And they are sucking dollars away from the deserving. 
</P>
<P>
 Government and health officials are baffled about what to do. Why are these 
women being allowed to take advantage of a generous system paid for by the 
hard-earned tax dollars of the country's citizens? 
</P>
<P>
 And what about the other interlopers, who show up in hospital emergency rooms 
with fractured arms and busted heads, bearing borrowed or counterfeit health 
insurance cards? 
</P>
<P>
 Who are these rip-off artists, anyhow? 
</P>
<P>
 Americans, actually. 
</P>
<P>
 And man, are Canadians ticked off. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In December, the New York Times reported that Americans were "filching" free 
health care in Canada in increasing numbers. The Canadian system, which offers 
health insurance to all legal residents of the country, is quite easy to abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone gets a health card, and since the cards do not have photos (although 
there is talk of adding them), they are easily shared by people of the same sex 
and age. There is also, apparently, a thriving counterfeit industry. And 
doctors are quite uninterested, said the newspaper story, in becoming "secret 
informers." 
</P>
<P>
 The story, based on a report delivered to Ontario's health minister, said that 
about 600,000 improper claims were made in Ontario between August 1992 and 
February 1993; 60,000 of those were found to have been made by patients with 
U.S. driver's licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, said the report, the illegal use of health cards is costing close 
to $700 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 An obstetrician who practices in Windsor, across the border from Detroit, was 
quoted as saying: "It's not an epidemic in any one person's practice, but I 
would estimate that from 12 to 20 of my patients at any one time are ineligible 
Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 My theory is that Canadian doctors, like Canadians in general, are simply too 
polite to turn anyone away. 
</P>
<P>
 Or they used to be at any rate, until their economy went over Niagara Falls in 
the same barrel ours did. According to the New York Times story, two Americans 
have been nabbed for health card fraud so far. They borrowed their Canadian 
friends' cards after having accidents while visiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our intention is not to send thousands of Americans to jail," a Canadian 
bureaucrat averred, "but to get them to pay their bills." 
</P>
<P>
 A frightening image: Americans in splints, casts and stitches, languishing in 
Canadian prisons, taking tea at exactly 3 p.m. each day. I wonder . . . will 
they get jam with their crumpets? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I won't bore you with the numbers here, but it's no secret that the Canadian 
health insurance system is superior to ours in many ways. My best friend lives 
in Toronto, and when I lived in Michigan, I used to spend quite a bit of time 
with her. We often found ourselves in the midst of competitive, sibling 
rivalry-like conversations comparing the American quality of life to the 
Canadian. 
</P>
<P>
 I was at a distinct disadvantage trying to explain why Detroit was superior to 
clean, safe yet stuffy old Toronto, but I think I made my points: homes were 
much less expensive, gassing the car cost half as much, and you could order a 
Scotch on the rocks and still have change from a five-dollar bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the discussion turned to health care, though, I didn't stand a chance. 
She could simply wave her little Ontario Health Insurance Program card at me, 
and I would shut right up. Here I would be, shuffling paperwork, figuring out 
deductibles and writing checks for the 20% or so of my medical care not covered 
by my insurance. And she never even saw a bill! Under the single-payer system 
in Canada (the payer being the government), doctors simply bill the provinces. 
No pesky insurance companies second-guessing the docs, either. 
</P>
<P>
 However (a big, giant, whopping however) the system costs -- how to put it 
technically? -- up the wazoo. Taxes are high. No mortgage-interest deductions 
for the poor Canadian home owner.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, my taxes aren't going down anytime soon. So it's too bad the Clintons 
didn't have the guts or the juice to put a single-payer system on the table. 
Instead, it looks like we are going to end up with a messy new hybrid of a 
system, if we get one at all. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, I'll be praying for the sake of my border-dwelling countrymen 
and women that we get health care reform soon. 
</P>
<P>
 It breaks my heart to think of them -- driven by desperation into a foreign 
land, willing to risk time in those clean Canadian jails, for a taste of 
something they can't get at home: a taste of, yes, freedom! 
</P>
<P>
 From medical bills, anyhow.

BOOK REVIEW / MYSTERY; POST-WAR TUCSON MURDER MYSTERY OOZES FROM CONCRETE TO 
ABSTRACT; VERSIONS OF THE TRUTH BY RICHARD PARRISH ; DUTTON, $20, 320 PAGES 
</P>

<P>
 Exactly how tough is Joshua Rabb, the hard-boiled hero of "Versions of the 
Truth," a mystery novel set in postwar Tucson? 
</P>
<P>
 He's so tough that he uses the stainless-steel pincers of his prosthetic arm 
to kill a man by crushing his Adam's apple, and when Rabb speaks out loud to 
God in a Tevya-like plea for divine intervention -- or at least a break in his 
most perplexing case -- Rabb simply cannot control his temper. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that's tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Versions of the Truth" may be the only mystery in the history of the genre in 
which the central plot focuses on the construction of a sewage system. It's 
1946, and cholera is killing the Papago Indians on the big reservation near 
Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 The only way to stop the epidemic, we are told, is to build a sewage treatment 
plant in the nearby Mexican border town of Nogales. And the rival construction 
magnates bidding for the job are perfectly willing to cheat and kill in order 
to win the big contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabb is a transplanted attorney from Brooklyn who works for the Bureau of Land 
Management and practices law on the side, and his job is to find out who is 
cheating and killing whom: Is it the aging land baron who is so generous with 
his horses and his women? Or the beautiful young woman who is either the land 
baron's niece or a hooker from Kansas City? Is it a pair of war profiteers 
whose construction business has fallen on hard times now that the shooting is 
over? Or the governor of Sonora, a potentate with an army of pimps, thugs and 
crooked cops at his command? 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as it turns out, a good deal of the plot turns on the finer points of 
government-contract bidding procedures and the difference between Type 2 and 
Type 5 concrete, but Parrish succeeds in livening up the story with lots of sex 
and violence. The lovemaking, I'm afraid, seems dutiful and even mechanical.  
</P>
<P>
 But Parrish really lets his imagination soar when he describes the parade of 
horrors that Rabb encounters in his investigation of the concrete scandal and 
his law practice -- the author seems intent on packing his book with graphic 
violence of the most gruesome kind, and the victims include a household pet, a 
12-year-old boy and even an infant. 
</P>
<P>
 Parrish styles Joshua Rabb as a man with an engaging blend of book smarts and 
street smarts, a sensitive guy with an unmistakable taste for rough justice. 
Rabb is a World War II combat veteran who lost his arm and four toes before V-E 
Day, and now he puts his mechanical arm to good use as a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 When his young Papago housekeeper gets pregnant, Rabb is helpfully pro-choice, 
even if it means breaking the law. And he reads "Siddhartha" in his spare time. 
</P>
<P>
 Tough and savvy as he is, though, Rabb cannot help stumbling into various 
social, cultural and political minefields that litter the old (cow)boy network 
of Tucson and the Papago Indian Reservation, all of which Parrish renders with 
great credibility and conviction.  
</P>
<P>
 And, rather like the pointedly stupid people who populate horror movies, Rabb 
allows his children to wander at will around Tucson and environs even after 
someone has broken into the family home and redecorated it with dismembered 
body parts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Versions of the Truth" is the second Joshua Rabb novel by Richard Parrish, 
himself a practicing attorney in Tucson. Like most attorneys-turned-novelists, 
Parrish seems to shy away from writing about what lawyers actually do , and 
instead he sends the Levi's-clad and boot-shod Rabb on a series of high 
adventures that keeps him far from the courtroom. Only once does Rabb crack a 
lawbook, and he never seems to spend much time preparing for the murder trial 
that is the major subplot of the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, to his credit, Parrish is willing to confront the moral compromises 
that one is required to make in the practice of law. He gives Rabb a couple of 
clients from hell -- a retarded youth who sets an ostrich on fire, and a 
sociopath accused of raping and murdering a young mother and her month-old baby 
-- and then shows how Rabb is willing to use his considerable skill and 
ingenuity on their behalf even though he knows that they are guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you defend an animal like that?" scolds his 14-year-daughter when she 
learns that her father will represent the accused rapist-murderer. "It isn't 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a lawyer, honey," he says. "That's what I do for a living." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not entirely clear whether this is intended to be a laugh line -- Parrish 
is mostly earnest and solemn about the woes that befall his lawyer-hero, and he 
brings the whole affair to rather dark and fatalistic climax. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's enough suspense here, enough shocks and surprises, to keep us 
reading until we find out the fate of the ostrich-arsonist and the baby-killer, 
and even the big question of exactly how much tricalcium aluminate was in the 
concrete for the Nogales project.

 Heigh-Ho, It's Off to Video: The animated Walt Disney classic "Snow White and 
the Seven Dwarfs" will be issued on video for the first time this fall. The 
1937 film was Disney's first full-length animated feature and remains one of 
the most popular animated films of all time. In conjunction with the 
limited-time release, Disney promises "the most expansive marketing effort ever 
undertaken for a video," including retail merchandise and promotions at Disney 
theme parks, on Walt Disney Television shows and on cable's Disney Channel.

 LACMA Crowds Double for Picasso: Crowds have more than doubled at the L.A. 
County Museum of Art since the Feb. 13 opening of "Picasso and the Weeping 
Women: The Years of Marie-Therese Walter and Dora Maar," a small, but 
critically well-received exhibition of works by Spanish master Pablo Picasso. 
According to figures released Tuesday, museum attendance during the show's 
first week (ending Saturday) was 16,795, considerably higher than LACMA's usual 
weekly draw of about 7,000. And weekend crowds waiting to see the show 
stretched down the museum's long entrance and around the corner onto Wilshire 
Boulevard. On Sunday alone, 4,890 folks turned up at the museum, compared to 
the average Sunday crowd of 2,000. The show closes May 1.

 Uffizi's Michelangelo Room Reopens: Crowds jammed into Florence's Uffizi art 
gallery Tuesday for the re-opening of the Michelangelo Room, damaged last May 
by a car bomb that killed five people in the Italian city. The room, where the 
Renaissance artist's celebrated "Holy Family" is among works on display, was 
the first to be restored in the gallery's west wing, which was most heavily 
damaged. Italian officials have blamed the Mafia for the blast, which damaged 
32 works of art. The remainder of the Uffizi's west wing -- 15 more rooms -- is 
due to reopen by the end of 1994. MOVIES

 'Last Action Hero' Losses Revealed: Arnold Schwarzenegger's summer film, "Last 
Action Hero," may turn out to be the biggest box-office bomb ever. According to 
an internal profit-and-loss statement obtained by the New Yorker magazine, 
Columbia Pictures had an "unrecouped balance" of more than $124 million when 
the film was pulled from release in September. In comparison, "Heaven's Gate," 
the infamous 1980 flop that nearly destroyed United Artists, lost only $44 
million. Columbia executives have insisted that through additional revenues 
including video receipts, "Last Action Hero" will eventually break even.

 Spielberg Watch: The latest announced tribute to director Steven Spielberg 
will take place March 8 during the 20th Annual People's Choice Awards, which 
will be televised on CBS. Spielberg, who is favored this year to finally 
receive a best director Oscar for "Schindler's List," has done well at previous 
People's Choice Awards -- his films "Jaws," "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and 
"E.T." were all Favorite Motion Pictures winners. QUICK TAKES

THEATER REVIEW; ZANY 'AMELIA' COMES TO MUSICAL LIFE AT CORONET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hire Amelia Bedelia as your maid and you're in for a few surprises. Tell her 
to string the beans and she'll string them, indeed -- all over the house. Ask 
her to strip the bed sheets and you'll find them in tatters. Instruct her to 
draw the drapes and she'll do her artistic best with pencil and paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Parish's books about the zany little maid with the literal mind have 
been giving young children the giggles for more than 30 years. The Serendipity 
Theatre Co.'s new stage adaptation at the Coronet Theatre is cloying at times, 
but a recent performance won frequent chuckles from both adults and children. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mea Martineau's adaptation, directed by Susan Chow, Amelia Bedelia (Katy 
Henk) is hired sight unseen by snobbish Mr. and Mrs. Rogers (Denys Gawronski 
and Mary Coleston) to tidy the house before a long-awaited visit from their 
persnickety rich Aunt Myra (Bette Rae). 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Aunt Myra arrives, the living room is coated with talcum powder 
(they should have told Amelia to "undust" the furniture), potatoes and carrots 
are set about two by two -- Amelia thought she was to "pair" the vegetables -- 
and Mr. Rogers' letters have been thoroughly stamped: Amelia used both feet. As 
you might expect, however, the Rogers' disaster is Amelia's triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 Henk likably brings Parish's zany heroine to life, although the action slows 
during overly sweet "everyone is special" moments with Amelia's young niece, 
Effie Lou (Lynsey Bartilson). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bartilson, the only child in the cast (she alternates with two other young 
performers), is accomplished, but her character's sticky messages of 
self-esteem and Amelia's awkward crisis of confidence aren't true to what makes 
Parish's books so charming: Amelia's blithe unawareness of her own quirks. 
</P>
<P>
 Music by C. A. Ballo and lyrics by Ballo and Martineau are sprightly; Ken 
Realista choreographs a sprinkling of comic touches. Jack M. Zoltak's modest 
set and Daphne's costumes are patterned after Fritz Siebel's book 
illustrations.

THEATER REVIEWS; STAGING CORRUPTS POWER OF 'EVITA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is it time for a new "Evita"? 
</P>
<P>
 We're not talking about a replacement for Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's 
grand opera camouflaged as a musical. Replacing the show itself would be a 
terrible mistake, as this is the best work either Webber or Rice ever has done. 
</P>
<P>
 But have we arrived at a point where a new staging is called for? The good 
people at the Fullerton Civic Light Opera clearly don't think so. Their current 
edition -- like the one they gave us in 1985 -- adheres to the original Harold 
Prince staging of the epic tale. 
</P>
<P>
 For anyone who has never seen this story of the rise and fall of Eva Peron, 
Argentina's unofficial saint, this production is a perfectly fine one to 
salute. Actually, as a colleague noted the other night, is a new staging even 
possible? Can you replace a masterpiece of musical staging? The odds are more 
than good that anything other than Prince's would bring the show down from the 
giddy heights to which it soars. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new Fullerton "Evita" (which stars the old Fullerton Evita, Julie 
Waldman-Stiel from '85) raises the question nevertheless, partly because 
director Jim Whitson's work is far from smooth and partly because this same CLO 
last year, with "The Most Happy Fella," did something very gutsy. It junked the 
recently heralded two-piano version of the show and restored the full orchestra 
edition, a move that yielded wonderful artistic dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping to the tried and true, the 1994 "Evita" is, as revivals go, safer and 
clunkier. The rapid rise of Eva Duarte from lowly singer to wife and partner of 
ruler Juan Peron is tracked with heady excitement, but the mundane, mechanical 
transitions of getting on and off stage, and moving set pieces, tend to bog 
down Evita's big career moves. 
</P>
<P>
 These transition problems are more acutely felt during the second act, which 
Webber and Rice have dared to construct as a serious, grave observation of 
absolute power corrupting absolutely. Even more daring is the winning Brechtian 
device of having Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara (Randy Gianetti) comment on 
Evita's every step, from her show-biz failures ("Rainbow Tour") to her deeper 
failure to match populist rhetoric with action. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Where young Eva literally dances through men's doors on her way to the top, 
the mature woman grips desperately to her position on the political stage, 
denouncing the military and wealthy oligarchies that circle her like vultures. 
Death comes surely, and Waldman-Stiel -- who is superbly mercurial throughout 
-- conveys Evita's decline with the same level of acting legerdemain that Patti 
Lupone brought to this monstrously difficult role in the '79 American premiere 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But it all feels too painfully slow this time, as if Whitson and company want 
us to feel the grind of the grim mass funeral that begins the show. We still 
can appreciate the nerve of the Webber-Rice-Prince concept (and can wonder how 
Webber lost that nerve and turned to producing such entertainment machines as 
"Cats," "Starlight Express" and "Phantom"). Except for Waldman-Stiel, though, 
there's a lack of spark coming off the stage, as well as from musical 
director-conductor Benton Minor's erratic pit orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Gianetti doesn't maintain a consistent level of sardonic distance from events 
(his Che sometimes seems as if he wants to be a part of the action), and his 
voice fails the full comic demands of "Rainbow Tour." Bob Lauder Jr. carries 
Juan Peron's blankness to the point where he nearly becomes invisible (except 
during the musical chairs act of "The Art of the Possible," still one of the 
gems of all Prince stage scenes). Rafael Duran as working-class singer Magaldi 
and Melissa Lyons as Peron's mistress deliver fine cameos with moments of 
electricity that this show too obviously needs. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Evita," Plummer Auditorium, Chapman and Lemon Streets, Fullerton. Fridays 
and Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends March 6. $13-$26. (714) 526-3832.

THEATER REVIEWS; A NEED FOR MORE 'AROUND THE PARK'; TWO ONE-ACT, ONE-NOTE 
COMEDIES COME ACROSS AS LIGHTWEIGHT TV FARE AT THE LONG BEACH STUDIO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As time goes on, the two one-act sitcoms that make up playwright Murray 
Schisgal's "Twice Around the Park" look more and more as though they belong on 
television. Indeed, avid TV watchers should get a big kick out of them. But 
they're one-joke pieces, way too thin to sustain an evening of theater. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Long Beach Studio, director J.D. Reichelderfer milks all the laughs 
Schisgal has provided. 
</P>
<P>
 In "A Need for Brussels Sprouts," out-of-work actor Leon Rose is practicing 
his lip-syncing of an operatic aria for an upcoming commercial audition. When 
his screeching gets too loud, there's a violent banging on his door, announcing 
the arrival of Margaret Heinz, a female police officer ready to write him a 
ticket for noise pollution. Of course, Margaret is -- in accordance with sitcom 
rules -- also the upstairs tenant. Anger is subdued; the two discover they're 
both recovering from disastrous marriages, and Cupid flies over, leaving his 
calling card. 
</P>
<P>
 In "A Need for Less Expertise," Gus and Edie Frazier attempt to follow an 
ersatz Eastern audio tape detailing exercises and rituals to help them realize 
the fullness of their marriage which, after 26 years, is faltering. The 
dialogue is right out of "The Bickersons," and the couple's eventual 
compatibility is brought about in as silly and pat a manner as is Leon Rose's 
with his upstairs neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the estimable Holgie Forrester, as both Margaret and Edie, can't keep it 
all from looking like there should be a commercial between the two episodes. 
Unfortunately, in an effort to save the day, she stoops to mugging and vocal 
tricks. Roger Galloway -- fluffy-haired and bug-eyed as Leon, and 
plastered-down, mustached and puckered as Gus -- depends even more on mugging 
to punctuate the laughs. When he forgets the gimmicks, he can be very funny. 
Both actors look as though they're filling time between more interesting 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the lighting operator seemed, at the performance reviewed, to be dreaming 
of better things to come -- switching the houselights off, then turning the 
stage work lights on along with the stage lighting, turning off the stage 
lighting, then turning off the work lights, then turning the houselights back 
on, causing one member of the audience to ask, "Is it intermission already?" 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe that was just Reichelderfer's attempt to breathe another laugh into a 
shallow evening. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Twice Around the Park," Studio Theatre, Long Beach Playhouse, 5021 E. 
Anaheim St., Long Beach. Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m. through March 19, 
Sundays Feb. 27 and March 6 at 2 p.m. $10. (310) 494-1616. Running time: 1

RANDY LEWIS: GOING FOR THE GOLD IN OBFUSCATION, VERBOSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a shame that Irish writer Flann O'Brien died 28 years ago. I, for one, 
would relish reading the dispatches he might file from Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 An indefatigable champion of the precise use of language, O'Brien used his 
column in the Irish Times to periodically publish "The Myles na gCopaleen 
Catechism of Cliche." He described it as "a unique compendium of all that is 
nauseating in contemporary writing." 
</P>
<P>
 Example: 
</P>
<P>
 What, as to the quality of solidity, imperviousness, and firmness, are facts?  
</P>
<P>
 Hard. 
</P>
<P>
 And as to temperature?  
</P>
<P>
 Cold. 
</P>
<P>
 And what is notoriously useless as a means of altering the hard facts of the 
situation?  
</P>
<P>
 All the talk in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Go back to O'Brien's description, drop the word writing and replace it with 
Olympics commentating and you'll start to get my drift. 
</P>
<P>
 Sooner or later, all of the CBS-TV commentators have provided sterling 
contributions. With apologies to Myles, not to mention security in the 
knowledge that courts have consistently ruled that it is impossible to libel 
the dead, we humbly offer an update of the Catechism of Cliche as it applies to 
various events: 
</P>
<P>
 * Bobsledding: 
</P>
<P>
 What form of doubt or indecision must the contestants always avoid?  
</P>
<P>
 Hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
 And what quantity of hesitation is impermissible?  
</P>
<P>
 Even a little. 
</P>
<P>
 At what point in the race is the avoidance of same most critical?  
</P>
<P>
 At the start. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the unfortunate event a little hesitation at the start is displayed, 
what form of recompense will the perpetrators suffer?  
</P>
<P>
 It'll cost them.  
</P>
<P>
 * Women's Skiing: 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically where, and according to whom, is the entrant's otherwise 
admirable vocabulary noticeably deficient?  
</P>
<P>
 Her coaches say she does not know the meaning of the words "defensive skiing." 
</P>
<P>
 * Women's Speed Skating: 
</P>
<P>
 Other than inhaling and exhaling, what do some skaters attempt in regard to 
respiration at the conclusion of a heat?  
</P>
<P>
 To catch their breath. 
</P>
<P>
 How recently have they tried this?  
</P>
<P>
 Still. 
</P>
<P>
 What aspect of unawareness does a long-shot's victory in this event indicate? 
Surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 To what measure of surprise does a long-shot's victory demonstrate these 
Olympic games to be infused?  
</P>
<P>
 Full. 
</P>
<P>
 These examples notwithstanding, no one is as generous in his or her offerings 
to the Catechism of Cliche as skater-turned-announcer Scott Hamilton in his 
descriptions of the figure skating: 
</P>
<P>
 * Pairs Figure Skating: 
</P>
<P>
 A successful performance in this event proves the entrants to be in possession 
of exactly what portion of "it"?  
</P>
<P>
 They have it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Precisely what three qualities constitute "it"?  
</P>
<P>
 The jump, the sparkle and the nerve. 
</P>
<P>
 What alliterative triumvirate of verbs contracted in the past conditional were 
conspicuously not exhibited by the Canadian team of Isabelle Brasseur and Lloyd 
Eisler?  
</P>
<P>
 No would've, could've or should've in tonight's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 That notwithstanding, what axis of the time-space continuum, in combination 
with a preponderance of what body of methods and which particularly repetitive 
manifestation of preparedness did Brasseur & Eisler exhibit in abundance?  
</P>
<P>
 Technique, timing and practice, practice, practice. 
</P>
<P>
 * Men's Figure Skating: 
</P>
<P>
 In what relative physical proximity were the parents of one entrant following 
their son's substantially less-than-ideal preliminary performance?  
</P>
<P>
 Beside themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 By which quality of disappointment were they accompanied?  
</P>
<P>
 With grief. 
</P>
<P>
 Of what vintage and class of skater does Russian gold-medal winner Alexei 
Urmanov belong?  
</P>
<P>
 A new breed. 
</P>
<P>
 What feat, successfully executed, distinguishes this new breed?  
</P>
<P>
 A quadruple jump. 
</P>
<P>
 And in what depository usually reserved for holding weapons or munitions is 
this rare deed stored?  
</P>
<P>
 In his arsenal.  
</P>
<P>
 To what sufficiency, quantity or amount of satisfaction have viewers, and now 
our faithful readers, been subjected?  
</P>
<P>
 Enough.

PRESIDENTS' DAY WEEKEND BOX OFFICE; HOLIDAY TALLIES LOWER THAN ESTIMATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Final box-office tallies for the Friday-through-Monday holiday weekend came 
out a little lower than the estimates, but the results were essentially the 
same: A big weekend for the industry, with $82 million in ticket sales, up from 
$75 million on the same weekend a year ago. Steven Seagal's action picture, "On 
Deadly Ground," leads with a commanding $12.7 million, even though that number 
is down by a million from the Monday estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Doubtfire," the cross-dressing comedy starring Robin Williams, will 
cross over into the $200-million box-office stratosphere within the next week 
to become the 16th-highest grossing movie of all time in the United States and 
Canada. It would be the first comedy since "Ghost" in 1990 to achieve that 
level of popularity. 04,28,18,10,10 Weekend Gross/ Screens/ Weeks in Movie

THEATER REVIEW; A 'SECOND COMING' THAT MAKES NO SENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those who feel the need to catch up on their penance and anyone else who'd 
like to see how low a show can go might welcome the Los Angeles premiere of 
"Nunsense II: The Second Coming" at the La Mirada Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 A sequel to "Nunsense," also by Dan Goggin, this revue-style musical brings 
back the five nuns of the Little Sisters of Hoboken and their penchant for bad 
jokes, worse puns and wretched songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, the sisters have decided to put on a benefit show. And the string 
of 22 songs interlaced with patter is nothing if not punishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Intended as a sendup of parish talent shows and the like, the evening takes 
this thinnest of premises and stretches it way too far. The musical numbers, 
many of which paraphrase show-tune, country and pop styles, may be intended as 
parody, but in fact they're merely amateurish. 
</P>
<P>
 The jokes seldom rise above grade-school humor. When the sisters read aloud 
from a mail-order catalogue of gifts for Catholics, for instance, the 
suggestions include "Pope on a Rope" and "Pin the Braid on Sinead." 
</P>
<P>
 Jo Anne Worley of "Laugh-In" fame heads the cast as Sister Mary Regina, Mother 
Superior, and her sturdy comic presence occasionally wends its way through this 
inane vehicle. Unfortunately though, her four fellow cast members have little 
opportunity to shine, stuck as they are in stereotyped roles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nunsense II." None sense. None fun. None Worse.

<P>
 Dr. Stephen Joseph Bernocco, a retired administrator at Northridge Hospital 
Medical Center and a San Fernando Valley doctor for 25 years, has died at his 
Northridge home. He was 59. 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime Valley resident, Bernocco died Sunday after a lengthy battle with 
lymphoma, a form of cancer, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Asbury Park, N.J., Bernocco received his bachelor's degree in biology 
from Villanova University. He attended Georgetown University School of 
Medicine, where he received his medical degree. 
</P>
<P>
 He completed his internship at the U.S. Naval Hospital in Charleston, S.C., 
and later served at the Navy's medical facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
Following his five years in the Navy, Bernocco moved to the University of 
Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, where he completed his residency in 
obstetrics and gynecology. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1967, he settled in the Valley with his family, joining the Granada Medical 
Group in Granada Hills, where he remained for 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernocco later joined the Northridge Hospital Medical Center's board of 
trustees and served as the hospital's chief of obstetrics and gynecology for 
four years before his retirement in 1990. That same year, the hospital opened a 
19-suite maternity ward named in Bernocco's honor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I live each day as if it were my last," he told The Times in 1985. "But 
you can't lay that on the cancer. I've always lived this way, ever since I can 
remember. There's never been a day I haven't been happy to roll out of bed, put 
my feet on the floor and get going. Well, not many, anyway. . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernocco is survived by his wife Georgia and sons Stephen and Gregory. A 
funeral Mass will be said at 10 a.m. today at Our Lady of Lourdes Church, 18405 
Superior St., Northridge. J.T. Oswald Mortuary in Reseda is handling the 
arrangements. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to the 
Northridge Hospital Foundation, 18300 Roscoe Blvd., Northridge 91328.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; A GOOD CASE FOR THE GRAND JURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's investigation into the shooting death of 
a sheriff's deputy on Christmas Day has been politically charged, and that's 
why it won't hurt, and may help, to have the case turned over to the Orange 
County Grand Jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Minority communities in Orange County have taken a high profile, questioning 
the way the investigation has been carried out and calling for federal and 
state civil-rights investigations. To date, no evidence has surfaced publicly 
that would suggest that there was any racial component in the shooting of 
Deputy Darryn Leroy Robins, who was black, by Deputy Brian J. Scanlan, a 
training officer who is white. The shooting occurred during a training session 
behind a Lake Forest theater. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, in what just happens to be an election year, the district attorney 
has announced that he is turning the matter over to a grand jury. Prosecutors 
have refused to discuss the case, although they acknowledge that it is not a 
regular occurrence to turn over a case in that manner.  
</P>
<P>
 We have said before that there was no compelling reason to question the 
ability of the district attorney's office to conduct a thorough and impartial 
independent inquiry. The unusual decision no doubt will give it some insulation 
from criticism, and essentially pass the decision to yet another removed body. 
There have been questions raised about whether the investigation could be 
affected somehow by the usually close working relations between the Sheriff's 
Department and the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Is passing the case along passing the buck? If it contributes to any 
perception of independence, there can be no harm in the decision. If it serves 
the larger public interest in bolstering the credibility of the inquiry, while 
also apparently providing political cover, well and good.  
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney has conducted solid inquiries in the past. But the 
imprimatur of the grand jury may add a helpful additional layer of review. 
Credibility is always important in investigations of shootings by police, but 
this case is particularly sensitive.

MORNING BRIEFING: BUT HE WASN'T THE FIRST GOLFER TO STEW OVER HIS LACK OF SKILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There is hardly a golfer alive who hasn't, at one time or another, used a 
Mulligan -- a second shot from the same place from which he had hit a poor 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Author Henry Beard claims to have discovered diaries of Thomas Mulligan, the 
fourth Earl of Murphy, who Beard contends invented the Mulligan -- the most 
famous name, he says, in golf. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the choice bits Beard "discovered" were Mulligan's rules of golf 
etiquette. Some of them: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Always replace divots in the fairways and rake footprints in the sand trap 
even if you have to move your ball to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Always give faster players some reason, no matter how lame, for why you 
won't let them play through. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Never use another player's ball on the same hole where you stole it. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Don't cut in on a hole if both the tee and green are occupied and someone 
is in the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Remember that it only takes a few extra seconds to pick up a wedge left on 
the green by a group of slower players in front of you and throw it deep into 
the woods. 
</P>
<P>

 Trivia time: After moving from Minneapolis, the Lakers made their first home 
in the Sports Arena. When it was unavailable for a 1961 playoff game, where did 
they play a home game? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Lonely Rocket: To say that Robert Horry took the canceled trade to Detroit 
hard is an understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like the kid in 'Home Alone' whose parents deserted him," Horry said 
when he returned to Houston after the trade for Sean Elliott was voided. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mourned: The Charlotte Hornets managed to hang tough when Larry Johnson was 
sidelined because of injuries, but they fell apart when Alonzo Mourning 
suffered a calf injury. 
</P>
<P>
 With Mourning, the defensive intimidator, in the lineup, opponents averaged 
107.2 points and shot 46.3%. Without Mourning, they averaged 115.5 points and 
shot 51.5%.

<P>
 It's about time: The late Terry Sawchuk, who holds the NHL record for 
victories for a goaltender (435) and shutouts (103) will finally be honored. 
</P>
<P>
 Sawchuk, who played for the Kings near the end of his career, will have his 
No. 1 retired by the Detroit Red Wings on March 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Sawchuk, who was rookie of the year in 1951, won the Vezina Trophy three 
times. He died in 1970.

 In so many words: When Margaret Farnum, chief administrative officer of the 
Coliseum Commission, received the Southern California Sports Broadcasters 
Assn.'s High-Five Award, she said: 
</P>
<P>
 "As (Olympic diving champion) Pat McCormick said (in 1956) when she was named 
The Times' woman athlete of the year, I can only think of two words to say: 
Thanks."

</P>
<P>
 He's a fan: After watching Indiana beat Purdue, 82-80, Saturday night, New 
York Yankee owner George Steinbrenner called himself a "Knightomaniac." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think he's the greatest coach in basketball or anything else," said 
Steinbrenner, who sat at courtside. "This is the first time I've been in the 
General's headquarters, so to speak." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinbrenner said he isn't nearly as good at what he does as the Indiana 
basketball coach is at what he does. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of the same feelings," Steinbrenner said. "I love the way his 
players are still wearing the right kind of basketball pants and the way they 
don't have their names on their uniforms. He's a real traditionalist." 
</P>
<P>
 But could he manage the Yankees? 
</P>

 Trivia answer: Shrine Auditorium.

Milwaukee Bucks: "I don't get to play. The team stinks. My wife lives in 
Denver. And it's been 20 below all year." DAN HAFNER

NBA ROUNDUP; OLAJUWON LEADS ROCKETS TO ANOTHER CLOSE WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Houston Rockets, who are 10-0 in games decided by four points or less, got 
33 points from Hakeem Olajuwon and held off a late charge by the Denver Nuggets 
for a 98-97 victory Tuesday night at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver, which had its three-game winning streak ended, had a chance to tie the 
game at the buzzer, but Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf could only manage a two-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston got its first victory over the Nuggets in three tries this season, as 
Olajuwon turned in an outstanding performance against Denver's Dikembe Mutombo, 
who had 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State 117, Milwaukee 113 -- He may have been anonymous everywhere else 
before becoming an All-Star this season, but basketball fans around Milwaukee 
have long known about Latrell Sprewell. The Milwaukee native scored 34 points 
and grabbed a game-high 12 rebounds, as the Warriors edged the Bucks at 
Milwaukee for their sixth straight victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprewell sank three key free throws and Chris Mullin two in the final 22 
seconds as the Warriors survived a charge by the Bucks, who fell for the 21st 
time in 27 home games. 
</P>
<P>
 Mullin finished with a season-high 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Day scored 27 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, both season highs, for the 
Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 93, New York 82 -- The SuperSonics held the Knicks to an NBA 
season-low 28.7% shooting at New York, but still had to hold off a late Knick 
rally to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Kemp had 21 points and 17 rebounds and Sam Perkins 17 points for the 
SuperSonics. John Starks led the Knicks with 30 points. while Patrick Ewing 
scored 22 on six-for-29 shooting. Charles Oakley grabbed 18 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 New York made 29 of 101 shots for the game, eclipsing the NBA's previous low 
of 31.2% by the Lakers against Denver on Nov. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami 123, New Jersey 97 -- Glen Rice sank eight of his first 10 shots and the 
Heat shot nearly 64% in the first half to win at East Rutherford, N.J., and end 
the Nets' season-high five-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 114, Minnesota 81 -- Christian Laettner was back from his one-game 
suspension, but it made little difference as the Cavaliers handed the 
Timberwolves their worst loss of the season. Larry Nance scored eight of his 22 
points during a 16-2 first-quarter run to lead Cavaliers at Richfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 107, Dallas 101 -- Rik Smits flirted with his first triple-double,

assists to lead the Pacers at Indianapolis. Smits made 11 of 17 shots and five 
of six free throws and also blocked three shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento 95, Boston 93 -- Mitch Richmond scored 23 points, including a key 
jumper with 50 seconds left at Sacramento, as the Kings rallied to hand the 
Celtics their ninth consecutive loss.

PORTLAND SHOWS MANNING HOW IT'S DONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the NBA trading deadline 24 hours away, Clipper forward Danny Manning 
isn't worried about where he might end up.  
</P>
<P>
 "If I get traded, I'll pack up and leave," said Manning, who scored 35 points 
in a 120-117 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers on Tuesday night before 12,888 
at the Portland Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who have lost four in a row, play Portland tonight at the Sports 
Arena in what could be Manning's final game as a Clipper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a great time here in L.A.," Manning said. "It would have been nice 
if it had worked out. If I get traded for some reason, I have a lot of good 
friends on this team and it's going to be hard leaving these guys." 
</P>
<P>
 The Trail Blazers have reportedly offered forward Harvey Grant or guard Terry 
Porter and former UCLA forward Tracy Murray or James Robinson plus draft 
choices for Manning. Other teams also are talking to the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, Manning was cornered by the Portland media, including all the 
local TV stations. However, a Clipper publicist told reporters that Manning 
wouldn't answer trade questions.  
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he would like to play for the Trail Blazers because he plays well at 
Portland Coliseum, Manning said with a smile: "Yes, I do like this gym." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Clippers trailing by 15 points at the start of the fourth quarter, 
Manning made his first four shots and scored nine points as Los Angeles 
outscored Portland, 26-11, tie it at 107-107 on a layup by Loy Vaught with 4:39 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 But Portland then outscored the Clippers, 13-8, to take a 120-115 lead with 
45.2 seconds left after a free throw by guard Clyde Drexler, who had 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Manning set up Elmore Spencer for a dunk with 33 seconds left, and the 
Clippers got another chance when guard Gary Grant stole Drexler's pass with 7.4 
seconds remaining. But Vaught missed a layup and a tip in at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest in Murray might have increased after he made his first five shots, 
including three three-pointers, and scored 13 points in 12 minutes as a reserve 
in the first half. His play helped the Trail Blazers take a 69-55 halftime 
lead. Murray finished with 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Rick Adelman denied that he was showcasing Murray. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to give Tracy some time. It as a case of showcasing. There were 
matchups out there where I thought Tracy could score. And that's why he was in 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever eventually happens, the Clippers will be relieved when Manning's 
status is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that it's going to get done one way or the other," Clipper guard Mark 
Jackson said. "Something has to be done. We can't continue to go out and try to 
perform like this. That's asking too much." 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Knicks, Orlando Magic have reportedly also made offers for 
Manning. Does he have a preference? 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of teams I like, but we're not going to get into that," 
Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Manning have any regrets that things didn't work out with the Clippers? 
</P>
<P>
 "From day one, I told everybody that I was going to become an unrestricted 
free agent," Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning, who came into the game averaging a career-high 23.3 points, hasn't 
been distracted by the trade talk this season. He scored 18 first-half points, 
10 in the first quarter, making six of 12 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've been consistent throughout the year," Manning said. "I try not 
to worry about trade rumors and trade talks, because that's part of the game."

LOYOLA BARELY ESCAPES CS SACRAMENTO, 73-71 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Loyola Marymount rallied from a nine-point deficit in the last four minutes to 
defeat Cal State Sacramento, 73-71, on Wyking Jones' tip-in at the buzzer 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 In Loyola's final home game of the season, played before a sparse crowd at 
Gersten Pavilion, Sacramento (1-24) threatened to win its first road game in 
three seasons as a Division I program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hornets led for most of the nonconference game and went ahead, 65-56, on a 
three-pointer by Damone Williams with 4:02 to play. At that point, the prospect 
of Loyola losing to one of the nation's worst teams appeared very real. 
</P>
<P>
 "It crossed my mind," said Jones, a forward. "At the same time, I had 
confidence in my teammates and in myself. I figured we'd find a way to pull it 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola (6-18) got back in the game with a full-court press and took its first 
lead of the second half, 71-70, on a layup by guard Robin Kirksey with 43 
seconds left. The basket came after the Lions forced a turnover on an inbounds 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
 After Sacramento forward Michael Boyd tied the score by making one of two free 
throws with 19 seconds left, Loyola got the ball up court and into the hands of 
guard Bill Mazurie, who dribbled several seconds before putting up a five-foot 
airball. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, though, was in favorable position, catching the ball and putting it 
into the basket in one motion as the buzzer sounded, ending a three-game Loyola 
losing streak and extending Sacramento's to 21 games. The Hornets have now lost 
49 consecutive road games in the last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Loyola Coach John Olive: "They outplayed us most of the game. What was 
nice to see is that we executed in the last four minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Center Ime Odouk led Loyola with 19 points and 11 rebounds. Jones added 15 
points and Mazurie scored 13. Boyd led all scorers with 31 points.

RADINSKY MIGHT BE OUT FOR SEASON; BASEBALL: WHITE SOX RELIEVER HAS LYMPH NODE 
REMOVED FROM NECK. HE WILL HAVE TREATMENT TO PREVENT SPREAD OF HODGKIN'S 
DISEASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Radinsky, Chicago White Sox reliever, had a malignant lymph node removed 
from his neck, and likely will miss the season while undergoing treatment to 
prevent the spread of Hodgkin's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Radinsky, 25, has returned to his home in Simi Valley to begin chemotherapy 
and radiation treatments that could last six to eight months. Ron Schueler, 
White Sox general manager, said Tuesday there was an outside chance Radinsky 
could pitch this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodgkin's disease is a chronic disease caused by the enlargement of lymph 
nodes and other lymph tissues. NHL star Mario Lemieux, NFL lineman Karl Nelson 
and Olympic wrestler Jeff Blatnick are among other athletes who have been 
afflicted with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's curable but you never know when you deal with chemo and radiation," said 
Schueler, whose wife died from leukemia in 1991. "There are a lot more severe 
ones than the one he has. But it's still cancer. I saw it with my wife when she 
was having chemo and radiation. It's not a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 "The cure rate on this type of cancer is 80 to 90 percent," he said. "The 
doctors are real optimistic. They think he will be fine and even to the point 
that he'll be weakened by all this treatment, but at times will be able to do 
little physical therapy to keep his muscle structure up." 
</P>
<P>
 Radinsky underwent tests after complaining of discomfort on the left side of 
his neck. The surgery was performed Monday by oncologists at Sarasota Memorial 
Hospital. X-rays revealed no spread of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Radinsky, a four-year veteran, appeared in 78 games with the White Sox last 
season with an 8-2 record and a 4.28 ERA. He was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Radinsky is married to the sister of shortstop Ozzie Guillen's wife. Guillen 
said Tuesday that Radinsky had visited him in December and was complaining of 
discomfort then. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's trying to be upbeat. He's a little nervous and concerned," Schueler said 
after talking with Radinsky. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think the doctors did a good job explaining everything to him real 
well. He's very aggressive. He just wants to get back and the doctors want him 
to get on with the treatment and get this thing over with." 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Herm Schneider said immediate treatment is imperative. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sooner he gets going on it, the better it is for his health, for his 
life. He's got the best of a bad situation but it's still a bad situation," 
Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schueler already has encouraged Radinsky to visit the team when the Sox go to 
the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 White Sox outfielder Darrin Jackson underwent surgery for testicular cancer in 
1987 when he was with the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most athletes don't think about things like this," Jackson said before 
Radinsky's condition was made public. "We don't think anything is doing to 
happen to us. I think this puts everything in perspective, that anything can 
happen at any age." 
</P>
<P>
 And he said he'd offer all the encouragement he could to Radinsky. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously you see where I'm at today. Seven years later," he said.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; GROSS SUFFERING SHOULDER STIFFNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kevin Gross said it's nothing to be concerned about, but he has been 
experiencing some shoulder stiffness since the winter workouts in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's improved a lot, and I'm still throwing everything, but I'm just taking 
it slow to be sure I take care of it," Gross said after the first full-squad 
workout Tuesday at Vero Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross said he first felt the stiffness in January, when he started throwing at 
Dodger Stadium. "I don't know what caused it," he said. "I didn't do anything 
differently during this off-season." 
</P>
<P>
 Pitching coach Ron Perranoski said Gross will probably throw on the side a few 
more times before pitching batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin has never had this before, and every pitcher gets it some time in their 
career," Perranoski said. "It's nothing to worry about."

 South Korean pitcher Park Chan Ho has been listening to English audiotapes 
every night, and each day he practices a new sentence. Tuesday, he greeted 
Executive Vice President Fred Claire with the question: "How old are you?" The 
night before, he asked Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda: "How come you look so 
tired?" Lasorda was midway through an answer before he realized that Park had 
spoken English. The players are also helping Park learn English. Tuesday he was 
walking around saying, "Hey dude." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Roger McDowell introduced himself to Ramon Martinez in the clubhouse Tuesday, 
chiding him for arriving to camp four days late. Martinez, who reported after 
the rest of the pitchers and catchers, reiterated that his tardiness had to do 
with personal business and not because his brother, Pedro, was traded to the 
Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a business and I take it that way," said Martinez, who gained about 
17 pounds during the winter. "When they traded Pedro, I was a little upset, but 
someday that's going to happen to me, maybe." MARYANN HUDSON

 The Panthers ended a three-game losing streak and moved into a tie for third 
in the Atlantic Division with Washington. Florida has 62 points, only 11 short 
of the league record for an expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe all of us here, deep down, believed we could compete at this 
level," Vanbiesbrouck said. "Hopefully we can continue and get into the 
playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Winnipeg is 0-14-2 in its last 16 games, and has only 41 points. Goalie Mike 
O'Neill fell to 0-6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanbiesbrouck was at his best late in the game when the Panthers were forced 
to play the final 1:12 two men short. Although Russ Romaniuk scored to make it 
3-2, a determined Vanbiesbrouck made sure Winnipeg didn't force overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Mellanby, Mike Hough and Stu Barnes scored for Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver 4, Calgary 4 -- Cliff Ronning scored a power-play goal midway 
through the third period and Pavel Bure scored twice as the Canucks managed a 
tie with the Flames at Vancouver.

 To inspire the U.S. Olympic hockey team Monday against Italy, Jack 
Blatherwick, the strength and conditioning coach, assembled a five-minute tape 
of Dan Jansen winning the gold medal in the 1,000-meter speedskating race here 
four days after Jansen had slipped and lost a medal chance in the 500. 
</P>
<P>
 The ploy was a success. 
</P>
<P>
 "The video put tears in my eyes, I know that," said Peter Ferraro, who scored 
twice in a 7-1 romp that got the Americans into the medal round. "It helped me 
in (Monday's) game and I hope for the rest of the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 Blatherwick, however, was reluctant to take credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw that, somehow, they identified with his spirit and respected him for 
the way he competed in the 500," he said. "To them, he was a hero for that, 
when to the media, he was a failure. I typed up a letter to him so the kids 
could tell him that. They kind of adopted him. So when he won the 1,000, I just 
put the tape together for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Blatherwick was in the editing room again Tuesday, in preparation for today's 
quarterfinal game against Finland, but he wasn't producing a Jansen sequel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be a bunch of good plays we've made over the course of the tournament," 
he said. "Grinding, hard-working plays CBS might not call highlights, but we 
think they're the kind of plays we have to make to win." 
</P>

 When Curt Lindstrom took over as coach of Finland's national team, he faced 
more problems than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 He knew he had to bolster the confidence of the players, who have long felt 
inferior to their Swedish counterparts, but he soon discovered that he had to 
deal with a drinking problem, too. Alcohol abuse is widespread among the 
general population in Finland, including its athletes, notably the ski jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all understanding now our responsibility to the country," said 
Lindstrom, who is in his second season as Finland's coach. "I told them they 
are all representing Finland and they must be ambassadors. Now we can take two 
beers without any problems." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although he coaches Finland, Lindstrom is Swedish. He coached the Swedish 
national team to second place in the 1986 World Championships and to the world 
title in 1987. He later went to Switzerland, then took a year off to run his 
family business, a betting parlor in Stockholm. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they asked me (to take the coaching job), I couldn't say no," he said. 
"It was an honor for a Swede to go to Finland and take over the national team. 
At first some people had reservations but they have since welcomed me with open 
arms." HELENE ELLIOTT

 If training runs mean anything, Gustav Weder didn't miss a beat in switching 
from the two-man bobsled, in which he won a gold medal Sunday, to the four-man, 
in which he will compete Saturday and Sunday. Weder's team had the fastest time 
in both training runs Tuesday.In fact, the Swiss were 1-2-3 among the 34 teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Will, who was eliminated from the two-man event in the U.S. race-off 
with Jim Herberich and Brian Shimer, was eighth in both training runs, beating 
Shimer, who was 14th, and Herberich, 20th. The three drivers will race off 
today for the two U.S. positions in the four-man event. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Bo-Dyn engineers support the view of U.S. bobsled coaches and drivers that 
research and development should now turn to the runners, the steel blades on 
which the sled rides, but are concerned that a project that has raised $500,000 
is almost running on empty and facing a costly proposition with runner 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sleds are probably only 5% short of where we want them to be and it would 
be a shame if we can't finance that other 5%," Coach Joey Kilburn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilburn called Weder the world's best driver, adding: "The only other 
difference in the sleds is in the runners." 
</P>
<P>
 Shimer's combined start time for the two runs Tuesday was .01 of a second 
behind Weder's, but his overall time was 1.59 seconds behind. ROSS NEWHAN

'94 WINTER LILLEHAMMER OLYMPICS; ITALIANS SNEAK A VICTORY; NORDIC SKIING: THE 
STRONG NORWEGIAN TEAM IS OVERCOME NEAR THE FINISH IN THE MEN'S 40K 
CROSS-COUNTRY RELAY. 
</P>

<P>
 It was obviously a setup for the Norwegians. 
</P>
<P>
 They had the home-snow advantage, about 100,000 screaming compatriots backing 
their efforts, and as dreamy a Dream Team as any Nordic skiing buff could hope 
to see in Tuesday's 40-kilometer men's relay. 
</P>
<P>
 Sture Sivertsen, who won the 10k classical race in the 1993 World 
Championships, led off. Vegard Ulvang, winner of three gold medals two years 
ago in the Albertville Olympics, was up next. And skiing the freestyle legs 
were Thomas Alsgaard, winner of the 30k race a week ago, and Bjorn Daehlie, who 
won two of three races here and was second in the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprise! He finished second again, along with his Viking teammates.  
</P>
<P>
 Finished second to Italy, a team that led off with 43-year-old Maurilio de 
Zolt.  
</P>
<P>
 In a race that had Europeans saying to North Americans, "That's what we like 
about cross-country ski racing," Italian anchor skier Silvio Fauner edged 
Daehlie by less than half a second. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a suddenly silent crowd -- slalom star Alberto Tomba was one of the few 
yelling for his Italian teammates -- Fauner, somewhat reluctantly, passed 
Daehlie in the hairpin turn leading to the stretch run, then outkicked a 
hard-charging Daehlie at the finish, winning by about a yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "For three years, they have been the strongest in the world," said Marco 
Albarello, who skied Italy's second leg. "The biggest satisfaction was to come 
into the stadium and hear that the crowd was silent. We were able to shut them 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Daehlie said: "I think we disappointed 4 million Norwegians today. Maybe some 
of them broke their TVs. But we made good entertainment. It was good promotion 
for cross-country skiing, I think." 
</P>
<P>
 That it was. For nearly two hours -- Italy won in 1 hour 41 minutes 15 seconds 
-- the Norwegian and Italian skiers raced as if they were on a tandem bike, 
Finns joining them for three-quarters of the way. On the last leg, though, 
Finnish anchorman Jari Isometsae was unable to keep up with Fauner and Daehlie, 
and they had the race to themselves, every grueling stride of it. 
</P>
<P>
 First Daehlie would pull away on the uphill portions, then Fauner would catch 
him on the flat. When he couldn't build a lead of any consequence, Daehlie 
changed the pace, slowing, trying to entice Fauner into a premature sprint. If 
Daehlie wasn't skiing on Fauner's tails, Fauner was skiing on Daehlie's. 
</P>
<P>
 When Fauner took the lead for good, it was at Daehlie's invitation. The skiers 
exchanged looks at the top of the hairpin, then Fauner moved slightly ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bjorn had tried to open a gap on me but I stayed right behind him, and then 
he wanted me to go into the lead (and set the pace for the finish)," Fauner 
said. "I was tired. He wanted me to go by but I didn't want to." 
</P>
<P>
 Daehlie said: "I wanted to go as No. 2 to the finish area. I knew Fauner is a 
little bit faster so I wanted to go behind (conserving strength), then go quite 
fast when there were 100 or 50 meters left and beat him at the finish line. (In 
that situation,) it's a little easier to go behind." 
</P>
<P>
 As they entered the stadium for the final kick, they were matching strides, as 
usual, in tandem, Fauner ahead. Then Daehlie jumped over to the left side of 
the track and kicked. 
</P>
<P>
 He got almost even with Fauner, then the Italian found his own kick and got 
home first. 
</P>
<P>
 Daehlie had nothing but praise for the Italian team, notably de Zolt. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the 1992 Olympics, I thought, 'He's old enough to be my father.' I don't 
think I'll ski as fast as that when I'm 43." 
</P>
<P>
 Each skier went 10k, the first two legs in the classical manner, the last two 
in freestyle. And de Zolt's opening leg was as surprising as it was impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 Sivertsen was first out and led much of the way but couldn't shake Mika 
Myllylae of Finland or de Zolt. After the first 10k, Sivertsen and Myllylae 
were even, but de Zolt was only a stride behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, the day was very hard," de Zolt said. "If I ran well, the others 
would be able to run well. If I ran badly, it would have been very difficult 
for others to catch up so I tried to run as fast as possible. I never got (an 
Olympic) medal and I thought this might be my last opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Albarello kept pace with Ulvang on the second leg, then Giorgio Vanzetta skied 
against Alsgaard on the third, Finns Harri Kirvesniemi and Jari Raesaenen 
making it a three-nation race. 
</P>
<P>
 Isometsae dropped off early in the last leg -- Finland got the bronze -- and 
it came down to Fauner and Daehlie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was lucky enough to take gold in the earlier races," Daehlie said. "I have 
no excuses. It was just nice to have so many people there." 
</P>
<P>
 Quiet people, as it turned out.

NOTEBOOK; NORWAY WATCHES TWO GOLD MEDALS SLIP AWAY TO FOES

<P>
 Norway has had worse days in the Olympics -- Winter and Summer -- but it's 
doubtful that one ever hurt as much as Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two anticipated gold medals in Nordic skiing quickly turned into a single 
silver. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly had the Italians beaten Norway's crack 40-kilometer cross-country relay 
team when Germany -- and Japan and Austria as well -- beat the Norwegians in 
team ski jumping off the 120-meter hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Jens Weissflog, the large-hill individual champion, gave Germany the victory 
with a final jump of 444 feet 6 inches. It was the longest of the day, tied the 
hill record and gave Germany 970.1 points. Japan was second with 956.9, Austria 
third with 918.9 and Norway a medal-less fourth with 898.8. 
</P>
<P>
 In team competition, four jumpers for each team have two jumps apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan appeared to have won its first gold medal of these Games when its last 
jumper, Masahiko Harada, took his final jump. His team led by 55.1 points and 
all he needed was an average jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he had a poor one, sailing only 319-9 and offsetting jumps of 442-9 
and 436-3 1/2 by Jinya Nishikata and Takanobu Okabe. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Weissflog launched his winning effort, and Harada buried his head in his 
hands. Harada, world champion on the normal hill, had leaped 400-3 1/2 on his 
first jump. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt the pressure before the last jump and my takeoff was too early," 
Harada said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Weissflog on the German team were Hansjoerg Jaekle, Christof Duffner 
and Dieter Thoma. When the results were announced they celebrated with a 
four-man wave.  
</P>
<P>
 The United States finished 11th among the 12 teams competing. MIKE KUPPER

 All was not sweetness and light in the men's 40-kilometer cross-country ski 
relay, according to Norway's Vegard Ulvang, who said that Italy's Marco 
Albarello had broken one of the ski poles used by Finland's Harri Kirvesniemi. 
</P>
<P>
 "Albarello came from behind and took the lead at the bottom of the second 
slope (in the second leg of the race)" said Ulvang, who was skiing just behind 
the Italian and the Finn."Kirvesniemi didn't want to let Albarello go and 
happened to touch Albarello's ski. Albarello was so annoyed . . . that he 
turned and lashed out with his pole, breaking Kirvesniemi's pole."

pole, and the skier continued running with the leaders.

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: AFTER A LULL, MARLIN FISHING PICKS UP OFF CABO SAN 
LUCAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just when it appeared that things were returning to normal off Cabo San Lucas, 
the marlin began sticking their noses into everyone's business again. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few weeks, anglers have had some of the best marlin fishing in 
years at the Golden Gate Bank, 24 miles up the coast on the Pacific side of the 
Baja California peninsula. Boats were averaging four or five marlin a day and 
some were doubling that figure. In 11 days, Dave Bishop and Mike Bocinsky of 
Chicago caught and released 69 marlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Sunday, when the top boats were flying only a few flags, indicating 
minimal catches. Some fishermen were even skunked, hardly the case in the 
previous weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sunday, for the first time in two weeks, we had two boats that didn't catch 
anything," said Tracy Ehrenberg of the Pisces Fleet.  
</P>
<P>
 But Monday, the scrappy stripers proved that they had not had enough after 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 Anglers aboard the Ruthless caught seven marlin, and other vessels had similar 
results. "It kicked back up and every boat in the fleet had fish," Ehrenberg 
said. "(Tuesday) one guy came in early who lost a big blue marlin, but he still 
released two stripers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As if such an abundance of striped marlin weren't enough to spoil anglers. . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 Ehrenberg said giant yellowfin tuna have moved into an area near the Jaime 
Bank about six miles from the marina.  
</P>
<P>
 "When the fish is lost, it's always bigger, but we had one client who says he 
lost a 200-pound-plus tuna Monday," Ehrenberg said. "But they've been catching 
several between 50 and 130 pounds. Some people are so intent on catching the 
marlin that they drive right over the tuna on their way up the coast." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The poisonous snakes, spiders and lizards didn't get Stephen Earl Cook, but 
the law did.  
</P>
<P>
 Cook, 45, of Garden Grove, was caught in an Arizona Game and Fish Department 
sting operation and indicted late last week by a Maricopa County Grand Jury on 
a stolen property charge. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the red rattlesnakes he had -- and which he tried to sell to undercover 
officers -- that resulted in the felony charge (most wildlife violations are 
misdemeanors). Red rattlesnakes are unique to California and parts of Baja 
California and were considered stolen from California. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cook's problems did not end with the rattlesnakes. Wildlife officers also 
found 215 red-legged tarantulas, three alligators and two Gila monsters in his 
possession. The tarantulas are a federally protected species, so that portion 
of the case is being handled by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Curt Johanson of San Pedro was surprised when he pulled up his lobster trap 
recently off San Clemente Island. Stuffed inside was a 58-pound octopus. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro considers the giant Pacific octopus, 
prevalent north of Monterey but unusual in Southland waters, quite a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 Johanson sold the eight-armed critter to San Pedro Fish Market, which donated 
it to the aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
 The octopus, with a tentacle span of more than 12 feet, is taking squid and 
mackerel from her keeper's hand between temper tantrums, when it turns bright 
orange and raises its horns, fleshy protrusions that rise from its head-like 
mantle. The huge mollusk was reportedly on its best behavior when it went on 
display Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 SALTWATER -- Locally, there is no reliable alternative to bottom-fishing for 
rockfish, but filling the freezer has never been so easy, as rock cod, red 
snapper and assorted other species are easy pickings. L.A. Harbor-based boats 
are doing well at times fishing for calico bass off San Clemente Island. San 
Diego's long-range fleet is still waiting for the giant yellowfin tuna and 
wahoo at the Revillagigedo Islands to bust loose. All but Mark Nakahama, who 
while fishing aboard the Polaris Supreme on its most recent trip, had two front 
teeth knocked out when a giant tuna bit suddenly, yanking his pole from his 
hands and nearly sending him overboard. The Polaris Supreme returned Thursday 
with 190 tuna (81 released) and 86 wahoo. The American Angler out of Point Loma 
Sportfishing returned Saturday with 166 tuna -- the largest a 301-pounder by 
Greg Trompas of San Diego -- but only 46 wahoo. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabo San Lucas: Aside from the marlin and tuna, there is a slight increase in 
wahoo catches offshore, and inshore anglers are finding an abundance of 
roosterfish and needlefish cruising the sandy shores. San Jose Del Cabo: Those 
casting live sardines at Destiladeras and San Luis Banks usually end up with a 
tuna or dorado on the hook. Average catch is about 10 fish a day when 
conditions are right. The Gordo Banks are also producing. 
</P>
<P>
 FRESHWATER -- New to the Fred Hall Western Fishing Tackle & Boat Show, March 
2-6 at the Long Beach Convention Center, will be fly-fishing schools conducted 
by some of the Southland's most notable experts. Participants should register 
in advance by calling (310) 697-8870. . . . Charlie Weyer of Studio City and 
George Szabo of Whittier won the American Bass Lake Castaic Open at Castaic 
Lake last Saturday, landing six bass totaling 18.32 pounds and netting $2,790 
in prize money. 
</P>
<P>
 CONSERVATION -- State wildlife officials announced a plan to improve 
anadromous fisheries -- those with species that migrate to the ocean after 
birth and return to streams as adults to spawn -- in the Central Valley. 
"Restoring Central Valley Streams: a Plan of Action" is part of the Department 
of Fish and Game's mandated effort to double populations of anadromous fish in 
California by the year 2000. The plan identifies action to be taken on 27 
streams to improve habitat and fishing potential, primarily for salmon, 
steelhead and striped bass. Chief among priorities is to restore habitat of the 
endangered Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon. Habitat improvement 
projects are already under way on the Sacramento River from Redding to Anderson 
and on some tributaries. Funding is on the state and federal level.

FISHING REPORT: IRVINE LAKE TO GET EVEN MORE TROUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trout fishing has been excellent at Irvine Lake, where many anglers have not 
only been filling their stringers with five-fish limits, but have also been 
taking trophy-sized fish as well. 
</P>
<P>
 As if that weren't enough, now the heavily stocked lake will receive three 
more tons of Mt. Lassen rainbow trout this week as part of the ongoing Mt. 
Lassen Trophy Trout Classic, whereby tagged trout can be exchanged for cash 
prizes. The derby will continue through March 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest fish of the week -- an 11 1/4-pound rainbow caught by Kaz Hosozawa 
of Cerritos -- was also a tagged fish worth $100.

PATTON WON'T RUN IN THE TRIPLE CROWN RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Patton won't run in the Triple Crown races because of bone chips in both 
knees. 
</P>
<P>
 The chips were discovered during a routine examination shortly after Patton 
won an allowance race by 8 1/2 lengths at Gulfstream Park on Sunday.He had been 
scheduled to run in the Florida Derby on March 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Patton will undergo arthroscopic surgery on the knees, with the 
recuperation period estimated at three months. 
</P>
<P>
 The veterinarian's examination was prompted by the possible sale of 50% of the 
horse. One of the investors was expected to be Gov. Brereton Jones of Kentucky, 
who reportedly was prepared to pay $300,000 for a 25% interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Patton, a son of Lord At War and a grandson of Seattle Slew, is owned by Scott 
Savin. His three victories in five starts have been by a combined margin of 25 
1/2 lengths, and in his first stakes race, on Jan. 30, he ran second to Holy 
Bull in the Hutcheson at Gulfstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology, another horse owned in partnership by Savin, has been sold to 
Jones for an undisclosed sum. The 5-year-old, who won the Florida Derby in 1992 
and earned close to $1 million, will be sent to Jones' farm in Midway, Ky., for 
the current breeding season. BILL CHRISTINE

LOS ALAMITOS; TRAINER GORDON HAS A SPECIAL STAKE IN SUCCESS OF HARNESS RACING 
MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ANDERSEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trainer Bobby Gordon raced around Los Alamitos almost as fast as his horses 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 He barely had time to stop and catch his breath over the course of the evening 
spent checking on horses in the paddock and talking with horse owners and 
fellow investors in the Premier Harness Racing Assn. He also squeezed in two 
trips to the winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon, of Anaheim, was a frequent visitor to the winner's circle last week, 
winning five races and climbing to fourth in the trainers' standings. He 
accomplished more in three nights than he had in the previous six weeks, when 
he won nine races in 67 starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The horses have started racing better," Gordon said. "I'm still doing the 
same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon not only oversees a 14-horse stable, but has been active in the 
management of the current meeting. The PHRA consists of 20 owners who have 
funded the winter harness meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon won't take full credit for it, but without his efforts, this meeting 
might not have taken place. Through the summer and fall, he worked the phones, 
talking with owners and trainers, seeking horses and investors for a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wouldn't have been a harness meeting if (Gordon) hadn't continuously 
bugged, harassed and pleaded with everyone to get involved," said Paul Reddam, 
a horse owner and investor in the season. "The California harness horsemen owe 
him deep gratitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, Gordon has had the chance to concentrate on the sport of harness 
racing instead of its business side. When Stand By won the invitational for 
fillies and mares Friday, the victory was indicative of Gordon's season: It was 
merely a matter of time before he started winning. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Gordon's stable consists of older horses such as the 8-year-old Stand 
By, a New Zealand mare owned by Bob and Loretta Staats of Los Angeles. In fact, 
it was a big weekend for the Staatses. Saturday, Scotch Raven, their 6-year-old 
New Zealand-bred horse, won his first Los Alamitos race. 
</P>
<P>
 Stand By lost her first six starts of 1994, but won Friday's $6,500 feature by 
a neck over Mystical Ransom. In the last few years, Stand By has developed into 
one of the best older mares in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, she made her U.S. debut, becoming the top mare of the Los Alamitos 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, she raced in Illinois and California, winning 13 of 27 starts and 
earning more than $102,000. Along the way, she set track records at Los 
Alamitos, Sportsman's Park and Balmoral Park. At Balmoral, near Chicago, she 
paced a mile in 1:52 1/5, the fastest time of her career. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Stand By has raced at Los Alamitos with mixed results. She was 
second or third in her first three starts, but in three subsequent starts was 
fourth or fifth. Her worse performance came on Feb. 11, when she was a 
well-beaten fifth in the fillies invitational after going off-stride at the 
start. Then, a week later, she was in the winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "She hit the gate or something (in her previous race)," Gordon said. "All her 
luck was bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Scotch Raven won five of 10 starts and earned more than $19,000 racing for 
Gordon in Chicago last year. The horse proved he belonged with a best time of 
1:54 4/5 and victory in a $10,000 series during late October at Chicago's 
Maywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 His first three starts at Los Alamitos in '94 were disappointing. He was a 
good second in the invitational on Jan. 22, but was sixth and seventh in his 
next two starts. He took last week off, then returned Saturday to beat an 
easier field, finishing the mile in 1:55, a fifth of a second slower than his 
best time. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hasn't been 100% in the last few weeks," Gordon said. "He was shod wrong, 
and that set him back. I'm hoping he'll be better in the next couple of weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon is still eight victories behind leading trainer Frank Sherren and, with 
five weeks remaining in the harness meeting, might need his entire stable at 
its best to have any chance of winning the title. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon is already a winner in the eyes of many harness fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I did put (this meet) together," he said. "It wasn't easy, but 
someone had to do it if we were going to race." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The harness meeting reached the halfway mark of the 38-night meeting Friday. 
Although the handle has lagged behind expectations, it has risen in the last 
few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Saturday, the average handle was $775,410, which is roughly $75,000 
below projections. In early February, purses were cut 20% as a result of poor 
handles in January. For the first three weeks of the meeting, the average 
handle was $705,891. 
</P>
<P>
 The rise can be attributed mainly to two factors. The shortage of horses, 
which plagued the opening, has eased, and the twin-trifecta has had sizable 
carryovers twice this month. Because of the horse shortage, three races have 
been simulcast nightly from the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, N.J. On three 
occasions, bad weather has forced the cancellation of that portion of the 
program, which averages $150,000 a night in wagers. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Fred Kuebler said the purse situation is being evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I anticipate the last six weeks to have a major turnaround," he said. "I 
think we can average $900,000 (during the rest of the meeting). It has been an 
ordeal, a challenge. I'm not in the least bit disheartened. I think we can turn 
it around." 
</P>
<P>
 Equally important, conversations have begun between Reddam and Edward Allred, 
a 50% owner of the track, about a similar harness meeting next winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ed and I have talked, and he's anxious to go forward," Reddam said. 
"Hopefully, we'll have something worked out in the next month."

HARVARD LIVE PUTS ON SMASHING SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't believe everything you see on television. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harvard-Westlake High basketball team Santa Paula Coach Tom Donahue saw on 
videotape was not the same one that beat his team, 76-49, in a Southern Section 
Division III-A quarterfinal Tuesday night at Notre Dame High. 
</P>
<P>
 "My impression from the tapes was that we could play with these guys and maybe 
beat them," Donahue said. "I guess tapes are deceiving." 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue also said the videotape showed Harvard's top two players, freshman 
twins Jason and Jarron Collins, were somewhat lazy and could be handled. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong again. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Collins, 6-foot-8, scored 24 points by making full use of his height 
advantage -- Santa Paula's tallest starter was 6-3 Otis Henderson. He made 10 
of 15 shots from the field, most of them close to the basket. He also blocked 
seven shots and grabbed 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines' other weapon was senior Scott Garson, who also scored 24 
points. Garson made five of seven three-point shots, including all three of his 
attempts in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got the two big guys in the middle and (Garson) can really shoot," 
Donahue said. "That's obviously going to make them hard to beat." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines (24-2) broke the school record for victories in a season, set 
by the 1990 team, which lost in the Section semifinals.  
</P>
<P>
 Harvard-Westlake will meet San Dimas, a 55-52 winner Tuesday night over San 
Marino, in the semifinals Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Wolverines aren't worried. They are playing their best basketball of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is great," Garson said. "Last game and this game is as close as we have 
to come to playing four great quarters. Our outside shooting is working. Our 
inside shooting is working. Our defense is great." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines beat Workman, 88-51, in the first round Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like these (kind of games)," Harvard Coach Greg Hilliard said. "We haven't 
had a lot of them this year because we don't usually score a lot of points. 
We're starting to do some things we haven't done all year, like find second and 
third options (on offense)." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula (17-9) was able to hang within 10 points of Harvard for most of 
the first half, but the Wolverines put them away with a 12-2 run to start the 
second half and another 12-2 run early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard had some good performances by bench players, notably guard Bobby Ahn 
(six steals) and forward Robby Gregory (six rebounds). 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines held Santa Paula's leading scorer, Manuel Escamilla, to 12 
points.

PALMDALE WRIGHT ON THE MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maurice Wright scored only nine points before fouling out of a second-round 
playoff game three days earlier, so the Palmdale High guard decided to make up 
for it Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 And he did. The 6-foot senior led the Falcons to an 81-64 victory over Buena 
in the quarterfinals of the Southern Section Division I-A playoffs at Antelope 
Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright scored 26 points, scoring on a series of breakaway layups and fancy 
jump shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today I knew I had to get back focused and thinking," Wright said. "I had to 
get things going so I calmed down and took control." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale, which won its 16th in a row, took over from the start. The Falcons 
(24-3) jumped out to a 14-0 lead and outscored Buena, 20-9, in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Two minutes into the second quarter the Bulldogs (16-11) went on a 10-2 run 
that brought them to within five, but Palmdale never gave up the lead.  
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons were ahead, 40-31, at halftime and 65-48 at the end of the three 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena had a difficult time keeping up with the Falcons' fast-paced offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew they were quick and that they got up and down real good," Buena Coach 
Glenn Hannah said. "That's what they did tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Buena tried to slow the Falcons with a full court press that proved 
ineffective. With 4:06 left to play, Palmdale was ahead, 80-51. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our quickness really hurt them," Palmdale Coach Garry Phelps said. "I 
still think it was a ragged game. We were not focused and we were not moving 
our feet as well. I'm not real happy with the way we played." 
</P>
<P>
 Hannah, Buena's Jon Kaplan and Palmdale's Erick Bridge each were assessed a 
technical foul. The calls had no effect on the outcome, however.  
</P>
<P>
 Wright was complemented by point guard Jerome Payton, who scored 18 points to 
give the Falcon backcourt 44 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Al Lairson added 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena was led by David Nutting and Robbie Knight, who each scored 17 points. 
Wade Hall had 10 and John Tobias added eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor shooting and turnovers hurt the Bulldogs, who had eight turnovers in the 
first quarter alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey we made a lot of turnovers too," Phelps said. "But I think we also 
created a lot with our press." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale, past the second round for the first time, will play Edison in the 
semifinals Friday at a site to be determined. Palmdale beat Hart and Temecula 
Valley in the first two rounds. Edison defeated Orange, 63-53, Tuesday night.

NORTHRIDGE CLUTCH SLIPS IN 7-1 LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The search continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the side of a milk carton or post-office wall could be rented. But then 
the missing party would have to be described, which isn't easy, either. 
</P>
<P>
 A clutch hit can look like a wounded duck, a frozen rope, a soaring home run. 
It can sound like plink , clank or plunk . 
</P>
<P>
 By both sight and sound, timely hits have been missing from the Cal State 
Northridge attack for three games, all defeats. 
</P>
<P>
 Same story Tuesday, when Northridge stayed within striking distance of USC for 
seven innings before the Trojans pulled away to win, 7-1, in a nonconference 
game at Dedeaux Field. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just the way it is when you're struggling a bit," Northridge Coach 
Bill Kernen said. "Nobody knows why, it's just baseball. Bad vibes from the 
gods?" 
</P>
<P>
 Heavens yes, it was another frustrating day for the offense, which had a 
handful of chances to put the hurt on 13th-ranked USC. Before the Trojans (5-4) 
broke through with five runs in the seventh, the game was a coin toss. 
</P>
<P>
 With USC leading, 2-1, the Matadors (4-6) mounted a threat in the top of the 
seventh. With Chad Thornhill on second and two out, Tyler Nelson sent a 
grounder up the middle that seemed destined to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
 However, shortstop Gabe Alvarez knocked down the ball behind the bag with a 
headfirst dive, forcing Thornhill to stop at third. Right-hander Javier Mejia 
(2-0), who relieved freshman starter Randy Flores with one out in the fifth, 
struck out Josh Smaler to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 An inning earlier, with Kevin Howard on first, designated hitter Eric 
Gillespie had Northridge's most head-shaking at-bat. He first sent a screamer 
down the third-base line that peeled foul by two feet. A moment later, he lined 
a bullet to third baseman Aaron Boone, who fired to first to easily double up 
Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good at-bat," Gillespie said. "What can you say? We have to put all 
the pieces together." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge right-hander John Najar (1-2) put together his best effort of the 
season before the Trojans banged him around in the seventh. He gave up two runs 
on three hits in six innings, and one of USC's runs scored on a wild pitch -- 
Najar's 10th in 22 innings this season. 
</P>
<P>
 He walked Walter Dawkins to open the seventh, gave up an infield single to 
Boone and balked the runners up a notch. J.P. Roberge, a St. Francis High 
graduate, singled home two runs for a 4-1 lead and scored one out later on a 
single by Alvarez. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt fine physically," said Najar, who was charged with seven earned runs 
on as many hits over 6 1/3 innings. "I guess they just caught up to me."

BURROUGHS DOESN'T THROW IN TOWEL, TAKES LOYOLA BY ARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Watch Eddie Melgar throw. See Loyola High heave. 
</P>
<P>
 In a wildly improbable finish, Melgar scored not one but two goals on 
throw-ins in the waning moments of Burroughs' 5-4 victory over the Lions on 
Tuesday in a second-round Southern Section Division III playoff match at 
Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
 Goals on throw-ins are legal, but rare. The ball must first touch another 
player before going into the goal. Both of Melgar's goals touched Cub goalie 
Brendan Curtis on their way in. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of Melgar's 40-yard heaves also came from the same spot on the right 
sideline, about 25 yards from the end line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just aiming at the keeper," said Melgar, who wore a soft cast on his 
sprained right wrist. "I didn't know he was going to touch them both. It was 
great." 
</P>
<P>
 His first score was a sailing toss that traveled toward the upper left corner 
of the net. Curtis backpedaled and barely deflected it, but not enough. That 
tied the score, 4-4, with five minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Four minutes later, Melgar made another throw-in. This one was less clear-cut. 
It appeared hit the crossbar and glance off Curtis before hitting the ground 
around the goal line. The ball was cleared by a Loyola defender, but the 
referee stopped play, consulted with his two linesmen and ruled that the ball 
crossed the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 Goal, Burroughs. And in short order, match over. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola players vehemently disagreed with the ruling, but Coach Carlos Leon was 
philosophical. "That's a very powerful weapon they have," he said of Melgar. "I 
knew going in about their throw-ins. They used it, and it cost us." 
</P>
<P>
 Melgar was thorn in the side of the Cubs (18-6-3) the entire match. Burroughs' 
first two goals were scored by spindly, highly talented striker Roberto Perez 
after taking throw-ins from Melgar during the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, throw-ins are better than corner kicks, because it's so accurate," 
Burroughs Coach Mike Kodama said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez also scored on a beautiful run during which he dribbled through and 
around two Cub defenders before touching the ball past Loyola goalie Justin 
Mehren, who was removed at halftime in favor of Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
 But Loyola answered each of Perez' goals with one of its own, and took a 4-3 
lead with 20 minutes to play in the game on a penalty kick by Mark Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 Burroughs appeared dispirited after that, ready to throw in the towel. As it 
turned out, Melgar probably would have thrown it in the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming back with two goals in the last five minutes is real sweet," Kodama 
said.

TENNIS / EVERT CUP; GRAF SWEEPS PAST GIGI FERNANDEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gigi Fernandez, celebrating her 30th birthday, blew out the candles on a 
birthday cake at a party Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, top-ranked Steffi Graf blew out Fernandez, 6-1, 6-2, in 
the first round of the Evert Cup at Hyatt Grand Champions, completing her day's 
work on the stadium court in only 47 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hired a bodyguard to club her in the knee, but he didn't show up," 
Fernandez said at a postmatch news conference, where she wore a red T-shirt 
with the inscription: "Me? 30? I Demand a Recount." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it was her advancing age or, more likely, Graf's brilliant play, 
Fernandez showed her frustration during the match more than once. 
</P>
<P>
 During a changeover after winning the seventh game of the second set, 
Fernandez remained in her seat and read a newspaper, to Graf's amusement, while 
Graf stood at the baseline, waiting to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was reading the money section," Graf said, "so I was thinking, she's 
thinking about how she's going to use the prize money she's going to get for 
losing in the first round." 
</P>
<P>
 Confirmed Fernandez: "I was reading stock quotes." 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 "Just to get my mind off it, try to relax a little bit," said Fernandez, who 
earned $2,650. "I should have done it earlier. When you're down, 6-1, 5-2, you 
have to try to do something different." 
</P>
<P>
 Graf, who has lost only twice in her last 63 matches and has yet to drop a set 
in 13 matches this year, moved into today's second round against Tracy Austin, 
who 11 years ago defeated Graf in the German's first professional match, 6-4, 
6-0, at Filderstadt, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Austin said Monday she had fond memories of the then 13-year-old Graf, saying 
she was impressed with Graf's ability and confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is that so?" Graf said Tuesday, appearing to be suspicious. "She said 
something different afterward." 
</P>
<P>
 She wasn't gracious? 
</P>
<P>
 "She said something to the press that I wasn't liking at the time," Graf said. 
"She said there were hundreds of players like me in America." 
</P>
<P>
 Pausing, Graf smiled. "Probably not anymore."

 After learning that three of his players -- guard Travis Ford, center Gimel 
Martinez and forward Jared Prickett -- were involved in a free-throw swapping 
scheme against Vanderbilt, Kentucky Coach Rick Pitino hit each of them with 
one-game suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford had acknowledged that players who were fouled in the Vanderbilt game 
allowed another player with a better free-throw percentage to go to the line in 
their place, apparently when officials were confused about who should shoot. It 
apparently happened twice. Kentucky won, 77-69. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitino said he called Vanderbilt Coach Jan van Breda Kolff and apologized for 
the incident, and that both agreed the free throws didn't influence the result 
of Saturday night's game. The players involved will sit out tonight's game at 
Tennessee. The Southeastern Conference admonished the officiating crew.

PACIFIC 10 BASKETBALL / DAN HAFNER; DOWN BUT NOT OUT, ARIZONA BOUNCES BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When they were beaten a couple of weeks ago by weak Washington, it appeared 
that Arizona, for the second time in eight years, was not going to win the 
Pacific 10 Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Wildcats are resilient. They battled back and with just three weeks 
remaining in the regular season still have hopes of at least a share of the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, the jolt in Seattle was just what Coach Lute Olson's team needed. 
Off their last four performances, the Wildcats appear to be the conference's 
hottest team heading into the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 They culminated their surge back into contention with a powerful 98-74 victory 
over UCLA at Tucson on Saturday, after winning convincingly at Stanford and 
California and at home over USC. The turnaround came after Olson made some 
changes in his offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats, who had a 17-1 Pac-10 record last season and then were bounced 
from the NCAA tournament, changed their style this season. With probably the 
nation's best guard combination, Damon Stoudamire and Khalid Reeves, they went 
from an inside game to a guard-oriented style. Gone were the big men, power 
forward Chris Mills and 7-footer Ed Stokes. It seemed a logical move. 
</P>
<P>
 The guards were effective early in the season, but opponents began to 
double-team them. With bulky 6-foot-8 Joseph Blair and 6-7 Ray Owes maturing 
rapidly, Olson went back to the inside game. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair and Owes responded; the heat was off Stoudamire, and Reeves and the 
Wildcats started to roll. 
</P>
<P>
 In the easy victory over the Bruins, Reeves and Stoudamire had 45 points, but 
they were only 15 of 38 from the field. Owes, from San Bernardino, had 20 
points and 13 rebounds to lend a strong hand with his finest game. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair is a sophomore from Houston who spent last season as a backup. He is 
showing great potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, Chris and Ed needed the publicity, so I stayed in the background," 
Blair said. "But now I've got my confidence, and when they started coming 
inside to me, I was ready. With Ray and I doing the job inside, it makes it 
easier for Damon and Khalid to get good shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Olson also gives the fifth starter, 6-1 Reggie Geary, a share of the credit 
for the resurgence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reggie fires us up," Olson said. "He would be valuable without scoring a 
point. He can do so many things to disrupt the opposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Geary, former Santa Ana Mater Dei High star, has a role he seems to relish. He 
is the Wildcats' trash-talker and is so good at it, he upset Jason Kidd and 
Cal's young coach, Todd Bozeman, a couple of weeks ago. The Bears lost their 
cool because of Geary, and this contributed to their collapse, enabling the 
Wildcats to turn a close game into a rout. 
</P>
<P>
 As Olson points out, the Wildcats don't control their destiny. They need to 
win their last five, three of which are on the road, and have someone -- 
possibly Cal on Thursday night -- knock off UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats play at Oregon State on Thursday night, at Oregon on Saturday, 
then play host to Washington and Washington State the next week before 
finishing the regular season at Arizona State on March 12. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If there were any doubts that Jason Kidd belongs on everybody's All-American 
team, they were dispelled on national television Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 California's sophomore guard took the Cincinnati Bearcats apart in the second 
half with his precision passing, and the shorthanded Bears scored an impressive 
89-80 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of injuries that have deprived the Bears of two starters, K.J. Roberts 
and Alfred Grigsby, and left them with a seven-man squad, Cal may be only the 
third-best team in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd scored 22 points, including four free throws in the last two minutes, and 
had eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jason controlled the tempo when it got late into the game," Bozeman said. 
"Those are things that make him the player that he is." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Go figure: The Pac-10 is ranked eighth among the major conferences by the USA 
Today/Sagarin Conference Ratings, but has a losing record against only one of 
the leagues ahead of them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Atlantic Coast Conference leads the Pac-10, 3-1. Overall, the Pac-10 is 
13-8 against the other six leagues ranked above them, and is 64-30 in 
nonconference games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Pac-10 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Pac-10 had tri-champions in football -- UCLA, USC and Arizona. It could 
happen in basketball with UCLA, Arizona and California. . . . Arizona guard 
Khalid Reeves, second to Cal's Lamond Murray in scoring, has made only one 
turnover in 124 minutes of the last four games. . . . Oregon junior guard 
Orlando Williams was the Pac-10 player of the week. He's the first Duck to win 
the honor since Antoine Stoudamire two years ago. Williams had 65 points in 
leading Oregon to its first two road victories of the season. He had 40 points 
in the 98-87 upset at Washington State. . . . California freshman Michael 
Stewart blocked seven shots against Stanford to tie the conference record. . . 
. Jason Kidd needs 24 assists in his last six games to break the Pac-10 mark.

 Treasury Bill Rates Hit Highest Level in 20 Months: The Treasury Department 
sold $12.3 billion in new three-month bills at an average discount rate of 
3.33%, up from 3.28% last week. Another $12.3 billion in new six-month bills 
was sold at an average discount rate of 3.53%, up from 3.43%.The three-month 
bill rate was the highest since they sold for 3.59% on June 29, 1992. The 
six-month bill rate was the highest since they averaged 3.66% that same day. 
The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors: 3.41% for 
three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,915.80, and 3.64% for a 
six-month bill selling for $9,821.50. The discount rate reflects the price 
discount received when government securities are purchased at less than face 
value. T-Bill Auction

 Intense Rivalry in Notebook Computers Heats Up: Competition in the 
fastest-growing sector of the personal computer industry intensified this week 
with Dell Computer Corp. unveiling its long-awaited notebook computer and IBM 
slashing prices on its sub-notebooks.Dell has revamped its notebook line and 
hired AST Research Inc. to make the portables under the Dell label. Wall Street 
applauded the move by the mail-order computer firm, sending Dell's stock up 
$1.75 to close at $22.75 in active Nasdaq trading. The Austin, Tex.-based 
firm's new Latitude line of machines, which weigh 5.75 to 6.4 pounds, are 
priced from $1,699 to $3,249. Meanwhile, IBM cut prices of its ThinkPad 500 
sub-notebook by up to 20%.

<P>
 * The Bolsa suffered another hit Tuesday, dropping 49.09 points, or 1.8%, to 
2,635.05, its lowest level since mid-January. Some selling appeared to be a 
delayed reaction to the government's report Sunday that economic growth was a 
mere 0.4% last year, compared to the 1% or so that many analysts had expected. 
</P>
<P>
 * The deep slowdown in the Mexican economy in 1993 raises the risk that growth 
this year will also be sub-par, which could clip corporate profits, experts 
say. Also, with U.S. interest rates moving up, many analysts fear that the 
recent decline in Mexican interest rates to historic lows may have run its 
course for now.

 A faltering economy in the late 1980s prompted the Social Democrats to begin 
an austerity program that chipped away at Sweden's social welfare system. A 
center-right government elected in 1991 quickened the pace, including cutting 
sick leave to increase production and trimming business taxes.

NO SURPRISES IN FED TESTIMONY; DOW RISES 24.2

 Market Overview 
</P>
<P>
 * Stocks were mostly higher Tuesday as investors focused on Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan's upbeat assessment of the economy, rather than on 
prospects for higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bond yields edged lower for the first time in six trading days, apparently 
on relief that Greenspan said little new about the Fed's rate plans. Stocks 
</P>
<P>
 After the three-day weekend, buyers were out in force in certain stock sectors 
all day, including food issues, banks and utilities. But the broad market's 
gains were fairly limited. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials added 24.20 points to 3,911.66, recovering much of last 
Friday's 35-point drop. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks, down just 1.39 
points last Friday, was likewise slow to rally Tuesday. It gained 2.30 points 
to 791.15. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading volume was moderate at 271 million shares on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street responded well to Greenspan's semiannual congressional testimony 
on monetary policy. Greenspan lauded the economy's strength, saying the outlook 
is the best it's been in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also warned that the price of continued economic expansion will be 
higher short-term interest rates, as the Fed works to keep inflation at bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Some investors may just have been happy that Greenspan wasn't more specific 
about the Fed's timetable for more rate hikes, analysts said. "The market was 
relieved he did not rock the boat any further," said James Melcher, president 
of Balestra Capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed tightened credit Feb. 4 for the first time in five years, leading to a 
96-point drop in the Dow that day. The market has been struggling since. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Tuesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Bargain hunters moved in on utility and financial stocks that have been 
slammed anew since the Fed tightened credit. Rising rates generally squeeze 
financial companies' profits and lessen the attraction of utilities' dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow utility index jumped 3.23 points or 1.6% to 211.77, after losing 3.56 
points last Friday. Gainers included American Electric Power, up 3/4 to 33 3/4; 
Consolidated Edison, up 3/4 to 29 5/8; and Southern Co., up 1/4 to 41 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Among bank stocks, Citicorp added 1 to 41 1/8, First Chicago zoomed 1 3/8 to 
48 and Wells Fargo jumped 3 1/2 to 138 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial issues were helped by Greenspan's optimism on the economy, and on

of which have been laggards over the past two years. Hershey Foods leaped 2 5/8 
to 53 1/2, Campbell Soup gained 1 1/8 to 41 1/8, Quaker Oats added 1 1/2 to 64

 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index dove 49.09 points to 2,635.05, as profit

 Bond yields didn't fall much on Tuesday, but any decline was welcome after 
last week's carnage. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year Treasury bond yield, which rocketed from 6.40% to 6.62% last week 
-- highest since July -- slipped to 6.60%. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors have been dumping bonds since the Fed tightened credit on Feb. 4, on 
the belief that the Fed was reacting to inflation signals that the market 
didn't see. Inflation is the No. 1 enemy of fixed-income investments. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Greenspan reiterated in his congressional testimony that the Fed's 
decision was meant to send a signal that it was serious about fighting 
inflation by keeping the economy growing moderately. 
</P>
<P>
 "We viewed our move as low-cost insurance," Greenspan said. He also tried to 
soothe the bond market by repeating his belief that 1994 inflation won't top 
3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said the market rallied simply because Greenspan didn't surprise 
anyone. "Some kind of minor bounce in the market was long overdue given the 
horrible price action we'd had in the past few days," said Anthony Karydakis, 
economist at First Chicago Capital Markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Also helping sentiment was news that consumer confidence in the economy fell 
in February after a three-month string of increases. 
</P>
<P>
 A slide in confidence could translate into slower economic growth. Other

 Pork bellies, used to make bacon, surged in reaction to the Agriculture 
Department's annual cold-storage report, released late Friday. In the report, 
the agency lowered its previous estimate of Dec. 31 stocks by about 4.5 million 
pounds to slightly less than 53.2 million pounds.

 Market Overview 
</P>
<P>
 * Stocks climbed Tuesday after congressional testimony by Federal Reserve 
Board Chairman Alan Greenspan soothed Wall Street fears about interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Long-term Treasury bond yields fell for the first time in six trading days 
in response to Greenspan's comments. 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar rose against most foreign currencies compared to its pre-holiday 
close. Stocks 
</P>
<P>
 During his semiannual testimony on monetary policy, Greenspan told Congress to 
expect increases in interest rates to keep inflationary pressures at bay, but 
he wasn't specific about when that might occur. 
</P>
<P>
 His comments, which analysts said contained no surprises, quelled fears about 
an immediate run-up in rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 24.20 points to 3,911.66 on Big Board 
volume totaling 270.90 million shares. Meanwhile, advancing issues outnumbered 
declines by about 10 to 9 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The market was closed Monday for the Presidents' Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day's big news was Greenspan, which wasn't big news," said James Melcher, 
founder and president of Balestra Capital. "The market was relieved he did not 
rock the boat any further." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed tightened credit Feb. 4 for the first time in five years, leading to a 
96-point drop in the Dow and a steady climb in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock investors dislike higher rates, which raise the cost of money to 
corporations with potential implications for earnings. They also make share 
prices less attractive relative to interest-bearing investments. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lawrence Rice, chief market strategist at Josephthal Lyon & Ross, said the 
market was also rebounding from its weakness late last week, as investors 
bought up depressed issues. On Thursday and Friday, the market shed a combined 
50 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 The earnings news and word again from Greenspan that the economic recovery is 
firmly entrenched encouraged investors to buy shares of companies linked 
closely to the economic cycles, such as autos, papers and chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Procter & Gamble rose 1 5/8 to 59, Gillette gained 1 3/8 to 62 5/8, and 
Clorox advanced 3/4 to 54 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing rose 2 3/8 to 107 3/4, and Caterpillar rose 
2 1/2 to 110 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Earnings news was good, with Deere, among others, ahead of Wall Street 
estimates, Wal-Mart on target, and Home Depot only slightly below. Deere rose 5 
1/4 to 82 1/2, Wal-Mart jumped 5/8 to 28 3/8, and Home Depot rose 1 1/8 to 40 
1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among financial stocks, Bank of New York rose 1 1/8 to 53 3/4 and Federal 
National Mortgage Assn. added 1 1/8 to 85 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Utilities American Electric Power and Pacific Gas & Electric advanced 3/4 to 
33 3/4 and 7/8 to 30 7/8, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dell Computer gained 1 3/4 to 22 3/4 after it introduced Monday a family of 
five "aggressively priced" notebook computers. Other computer makers also rose, 
with IBM gaining 1 to 53 5/8, and Compaq Computer up 2 3/8 to 95 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Benton Oil & Gas surged 1 1/16 to 5 3/4. The company said it acquired an 
additional 30% stake in Benton-Vinccler, its Venezuelan venture. Kidder Peabody 
upgraded its rating on the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Markets ended mostly lower abroad. In Tokyo, the Nikkei average closed at 
19,342.63, down 51.31 points, while Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average finished 
at 2,107.62, off 11.91 points. 
</P>
<P>
 London's Financial Times 100-share average fell 16.6 points to 3,333.7. Credit 
</P>
<P>
 Bond market investors expressed relief that the Fed chief's testimony lacked 
any surprises that could potentially depress bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's main 30-year bond fell to 6.60% from Friday's 
6.62%, pushing up the price, which moves in the opposite direction by 5/16 
point, or $3.13 cents per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan said in his semiannual report to Congress that the Fed's recent 
actions designed to increase the federal funds rate on Feb. 4 -- to 3.25% from 
3% -- were likely to be followed by further rate rises. The funds rate, the 
interest on overnight loans between banks, was 3.313% on Tuesday, unchanged 
from Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond market prices have plunged in the past two weeks on the belief that 
further rates rises are on the way, a trend that depresses the value of 
already-sold bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the market's ability to advance Tuesday showed that the market 
already has absorbed the bad news from the first rate hike. Other Markets 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar opened much higher in New York from its close Friday. But the gain 
reflected the dollar's rise on world markets Monday, when New York financial 
markets were closed for the Presidents' Day holiday.

 The dollar traded in tight ranges Tuesday, with little news to influence it. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar finished at 105.60 Japanese yen and 1.7245 German 
marks, up from 104.55 yen and 1.714 marks, respectively, Friday.

 Gold prices fell on the New York Comex, closing at $378.00 an ounce, off $2.30

FERTILITY DOCTOR WHO USED OWN SPERM BEGINS 5-YEAR TERM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A fertility doctor convicted of fraud for using his own sperm to impregnate 
unwitting patients, producing perhaps 70 children, has begun serving his 
five-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecil Jacobson entered the federal prison camp at Florence last week, almost 
two years after he was sentenced in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va., for 
deceiving patients who sought his help. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobson reported to prison after a judge ruled that he could not remain free 
on bond now that nearly all of his appeals have been exhausted. Pending is a 
request for the U.S. Supreme Court to hear his case. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobson, who practiced in Virginia from 1976 to 1988, may have fathered as 
many as 70 children while telling women he was artificially inseminating them 
with sperm from anonymous donors, prosecutors said.

VICKY HOWARD SAYS SHE WON'T SEEK REELECTION; POLITICS: THE ONE-TERM 
SUPERVISOR'S SURPRISE MOVE SETS OFF A SCRAMBLE AMONG POSSIBLE SUCCESSORS FOR 
HER EAST COUNTY SEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County Supervisor Vicky Howard announced Tuesday that she will not 
seek a second term in June, a surprise move that caught the county's political 
establishment off guard and set off a scramble among possible successors. 
</P>
<P>
 As her eyes welled up with tears, Howard, 60, said at a press conference that 
after much soul searching, she has decided to leave her job after only one 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a personal situation," she said, speaking barely above a whisper. 
"I don't think it's any secret that I'm not the youngest person around. You 
kind of sometimes realize . . . that you need to take time to smell the roses." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Howard declined to elaborate on why she opted against a reelection 
bid, sources close to the supervisor said she wants to spend more time with her 
70-year-old husband, Jim, who has reportedly been in ill health. The couple 
live in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard's decision came just three months after Supervisor Maria E. VanderKolk 
formally announced that she would not seek reelection this spring, a decision 
she alluded to for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 While county officials said they had anticipated VanderKolk's decision, they 
were shocked by Howard's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe it," Supervisor John K. Flynn said. "Things change so 
abruptly in politics. One minute she is running, the next she's not." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maggie Kildee said: "I had absolutely no knowledge that she was 
going to make this decision. We will certainly miss her on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has been a very good and steadying influence. She has really represented 
the eastern part of the county very well but never lost sight of the fact that 
she was responsible for all of the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, who represents the Simi Valley and Moorpark areas in the county's 4th 
Supervisorial District, said she reached her decision after several months of 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the holidays, it became clear to me I had very little time to spend 
with my family," Howard said in an interview after the press conference. "It 
brought it home that you need to have some personal time. You need to look at 
some other things. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough decision to make. It is not one I came to easily or lightly, and 
not without some regret. I really enjoyed working for people." 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisor's decision not to run again leaves the seat open to a host of 
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, who searched for two weeks for a candidate to replace her, Tuesday 
threw her support behind Simi Valley City Councilwoman Judy Mikels, 48. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after Howard announced her decision at the East County Courthouse, 
Mikels made public her plans to seek the open seat in a brief press conference 
outside the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking without the aid of a script, Mikels praised Howard, who stood next to 
her throughout the conference, and pledged to continue the supervisor's work if 
elected to replace her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very sad surprise for me when Vicky told me she was not running," 
Mikels said. "It was a hard decision to reach, but I'm now committed and I will 
go after this seat as vigorously as I can." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels, a 12-year Simi Valley resident who has served on the City Council 
since 1990, would have been up for reelection to the council in November. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the conference, Howard spoke briefly in support of Mikels. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gone out campaigning together in past elections and worked side by side 
on many issues," Howard said. "We don't always agree on every issue, but the 
important thing is the overall service and dedication to the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Just two hours before Howard's announcement, Moorpark City Councilman Scott 
Montgomery, 40, officially declared his candidacy for the supervisor's job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe my base here in Moorpark is very secure," said Montgomery, who had 
heard beforehand that Howard was not running. "The issues in Simi Valley are 
not dissimilar from the ones that we, in many cases, solved here in Moorpark. 
This is a time when the torch of responsibility can and should pass from Simi 
Valley to Moorpark officials." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Moorpark official mulling a supervisorial bid is Mayor Paul Lawrason. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrason, a staunch Howard supporter, said the supervisor's decision not to 
run prompted him to consider entering the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am entertaining the idea," he said Tuesday. "I have an interest in that 
position. I think it's a key place to make a difference as far as our quality 
of life is concerned here in the county, and I would find that an honor to be 
able to spend some time there." 
</P>
<P>
 Several weeks ago, Simi Valley City Councilwoman Barbara Williamson -- one of 
Howard's critics -- said she would seek election to the position. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson, 48, a vice president at Simi Valley Bank, was elected to the City 
Council a little more than year ago from a pool of 13 candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Commenting on Howard's support of Mikels, Williamson said: "I think it's an 
insult to the intelligence of the community that Vicky Howard thinks she can 
hand-pick her own successor." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton, meanwhile, said he declined Howard's request 
last week to run for the seat because he had already committed to a bid for the 
county auditor-controller position. Sources close to Howard also said she asked 
retiring Simi Police Chief Lindsey Paul Miller to run. Miller declined to 
comment on the matter when contacted Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk's slot representing the area stretching from the Conejo Valley to 
Port Hueneme is also expected to be hotly contested. As of Tuesday, 11 possible 
contenders had taken out papers to run for the seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn said the two elections could completely change the makeup of the 
now-conservative Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the board is going to change dramatically," said Flynn, who has often 
criticized his colleagues. "I think we need an infusion of some good thinking 
and some good ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Flynn said he thought that Howard had served well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have quite a bit of respect for Vicky," Flynn said. "She is an 
exceptionally kind and sensitive person." 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk added: "Vicky worked so hard. She just had all the best intentions 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "She loved her job but it was interfering and she had to make a choice. I 
admire her for the choice she made." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard was elected to the Board of Supervisors in 1990 after defeating her 
next-door neighbor, Bill Davis, a Simi Valley councilman, in a heated battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to joining the board, Howard served for eight years on the Simi Valley 
City Council. Before that, she was a member of the city's Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard moved to Simi Valley in 1965 from Canoga Park after her husband took a 
job as an engineer with Rockwell International Corp. Howard, the mother of 
three, went to work as a real estate agent and volunteered to serve on her 
Neighborhood Council. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 30-minute press conference Tuesday, Howard expressed regret at 
leaving office and gave a detailed summary of her work on the board, including 
her service on the budget, transportation and waste commissions, and listed the 
objectives she hopes to achieve in her final 10 months in office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is extremely painful for me to disappoint the fine people who have 
supported me," Howard said. "But I cannot commit myself to be so intensely 
involved for the next four years."

COLLEGES PLANNING 2 SUMMER SESSIONS; EDUCATION: MOVE IS AN ATTEMPT TO BOOST 
SAGGING ENROLLMENT AT THE THREE CAMPUSES. FIRST SET OF CLASSES WILL START MAY 
23. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ventura County's three community colleges will hold two summer sessions this 
year in an attempt to boost dwindling enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, the Ventura County Community College District holds one six-week 
summer session, running from the middle of June into early August. 
</P>
<P>
 But with enrollment dropping by more than 8% this school year compared to 
last, district officials said they wanted to double the summer sessions to 
offer students as many opportunities as possible to register. 
</P>
<P>
 The first session at all three colleges will start May 23, three days after 
the spring session ends, and run through the end of June. The second sessions 
vary by date, but will all end by Aug. 11, college officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fall classes start in the college district Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura College will offer about 50 more classes, and Oxnard College will 
offer about 30 more classes this summer than previously planned, college 
officials said. Moorpark College will not offer any extra classes, but merely 
redistribute the 170 classes on the summer schedule, administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say this summer may be a particularly good time to offer 
more classes since many students who dropped classes following the upheavals of 
the January earthquake might be looking to pick some up again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything we can do to help them get an education within their time frame is, 
I think, a good idea," said Allan Jacobs, president of the board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say they also hope to attract local students attending Cal 
State Northridge who had to take a lighter load than they had planned this 
spring because of the extensive quake damage at the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've personally been contacted by Northridge students asking what we would be 
offering this summer," said Larry Calderon, vice president of instruction at 
Oxnard College. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many college district students said they thought that the change sounds like a 
great idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was given a few weeks off (between sessions), I probably wouldn't go 
back to school, because you get into your summertime ways," said Moorpark 
College student Matt Magee, 20, of Newbury Park, who is trying to steel himself 
to register for a summer session for the first time. "But one thing about 
starting right after school gets out is you're still in the school mode."

 Erika Freiman, 20, also a Moorpark College student, said the reason she has 
never registered for summer session is because it always interferes with a 
vacation her family had planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Double sessions, the Newbury Park resident said, "are the more intelligent 
choice because then if you had a trip planned at the beginning or the end of 
the summer, you could do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Hernandez, 31, a student at Ventura College, pointed out that the 
double sessions offer students two opportunities to catch up on classes they 
may have missed in the spring, or to get ahead in their college schedule, if 
they choose. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great," said Hernandez, who plans to register for at least one 
of the sessions. "It gives us more opportunity to catch up if we're behind, and 
it also gives students the opportunity to take extra classes that they need to 
fulfill their goals." 
</P>
<P>
 For the financially pinched college district, the double summer sessions would 
be yet another way to raise money. The district receives state money for every 
extra student it educates, up to a set limit, or cap, determined by a complex 
formula. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every dollar we spend on these (summer) programs will generate $3 in state 
revenue," said Jeff Marsee, the district's vice chancellor for administrative 
services. "So it's critical that we get these courses going so we get back up 
to cap."

CAMARILLO CONSIDERS SMOKING RESTRICTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Camarillo City Council today will consider banning smoking in restaurants, 
businesses and virtually all indoor public places. 
</P>
<P>
 If the ordinance is approved, Camarillo will become the fifth Ventura County 
city to tighten its smoking restrictions since Moorpark began the trend in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo ordinance would prohibit smoking in indoor public places, such 
as banks, restaurants, coin laundries, educational facilities, theaters, 
shopping malls, elevators, pool halls and sports arenas. 
</P>
<P>
 Bars would be exempted, but restaurant bars could allow smoking only if they 
have a separate ventilation system. 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo ordinance stops short of banning smoking in hotels and motels, 
as long as half of the rooms are designated as nonsmoking. The selling or 
dispensing of tobacco products from vending machines would also be prohibited, 
except for machines in bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Ken Gose said he is waiting to hear how residents feel about the 
proposal before deciding how he will vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to wait for the public," Gose said. "Normally, I am very reluctant to 
vote to take away peoples' rights. But on the other hand, people have the right 
not to breathe secondhand smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman David Smith said he supports the ordinance and expects it to 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would suspect it will go through," he said. "My expectation is that there 
will be strong support for the ordinance. I will support it." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager J. William Little said the proposal has been met with criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got the usual comments . . . mainly from the restaurant industry," he 
said, explaining that restaurateurs are worried that the strict ordinance would 
drive customers to restaurants that allow smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Economically, I just don't believe that's the case," Little said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Camarillo restaurant owners and managers disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a couple of customers say, 'You won't be seeing us if we can't 
smoke,' " said Laurie Swisher, manager of Garfields Bar & Grill. Since 
Garfields does not have separate bar and restaurant areas, Swisher said it 
would probably have to comply with the ordinance and prohibit all customers 
from smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would affect us. I think people who do come in and smoke will not 
like it," she said. "I don't know if people will stop coming in, but what can 
you do? Probably 40% of our business is smokers." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Hunt, co-owner of the Camarillo Seafood Parlor & Saloon, said her 
restaurant won't be affected, but she voiced concern for others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of my clientele are nonsmoking," Hunt said. "I think that it will make 
it easier for me, but I feel badly for other restaurant owners it's going to 
hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Little said the city began getting letters urging a tougher ordinance after 
Moorpark adopted its law. Since then, Thousand Oaks, Ojai and Ventura have 
passed similar anti-smoking laws, and Ventura County has adopted new 
restrictions for unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Little said city officials have studied these ordinances to create one for 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will take a tentative vote after hearing public comments tonight. 
If approved on a second reading in two weeks, the ordinance would go into 
effect 30 days later, although the city would give businesses 10 months to make 
ventilation and structural changes. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo City Council will meet at 5 p.m. today at City Hall, 601 Carmen 
Drive.

PLAN TO EXPAND DOWNTOWN AREA IS ATTACKED; VENTURA: PANEL IS EXPECTED TO APPROVE 
INCLUSION OF UPPER VENTURA AVENUE. CRITICS SAY IT WOULD HURT CITY'S HOUSING 
GOALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some Ventura city leaders want to greatly expand the city's downtown 
boundaries to include the upper Ventura Avenue area, a move that critics say 
would damage the city's long-term housing goals for the downtown and favor 
developers who propose to build 330 townhouses in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee of the Ventura City Council is expected today to approve the plan, 
which would stretch the city's downtown boundaries more than 20 blocks north, 
from West Park Row Avenue to Arapaho Street. The three-member committee 
includes council members Jim Monahan, Jack Tingstrom and Rosa Lee Measures. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the full council later this spring, the move would allow 
developers in the upper Avenue area to apply for 330 housing units immediately, 
rather than wait until April like other developers. The Neel and Huntsinger 
families of Ventura, with the national copy service Kinko's, are proposing to 
turn vacant lots and a lemon grove into a neighborhood of townhouses, business 
offices and industrial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's recommendation to help fast-track the upper Avenue project has 
already drawn sharp criticism from other council members. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shell game," Councilman Gary Tuttle said. "It's a manipulation of 
housing allocations." 
</P>
<P>
 But pro-growth council members point out that because no developers have 
stepped forward to apply for the downtown allocations, the boundaries of what 
is considered the city's downtown should be expanded to allow other 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the allocations have been on the table, no one has applied for it," 
said Monahan, who supports the change. "I think that council members will see 
that it's the only way that something will get built on that side of town." 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the council decided to set aside 500 units on a first-come, 
first-served basis for downtown to encourage developers to build in the city's 
old commercial center. The council decided to use the same boundaries set forth 
in the city's Downtown Specific Plan, a regulatory and policy document that 
details the city's plans to revitalize the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle, one of the council's strongest advocates for downtown residential 
development, said he is upset that the committee wants to raid the downtown 
allocations for another development. A developer must apply for and receive 
housing allocations from the City Council before getting permits to build. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year, the council distributes a handful of housing units to developers, 
who usually apply for more than are available. The council has a maximum of 
1,628 housing units to give through the year 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 If they qualify for the downtown housing allocations, Kinko's and the Neel and 
Huntsinger families would not have to compete with other developers for the 
1,628 units available. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm outraged by it," Tuttle said. "It's blatant favoritism." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsay Nielson, who represents the Huntsinger family, said he does not think 
that the committee's recommendation would be considered an act of favoritism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not competing with anyone for the downtown allocations," Nielson said. 
"There's nothing happening in the downtown, and frankly, the Avenue is an 
extension of downtown." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gregory L. Carson said he sides with Tuttle in maintaining the 
current downtown boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to have a successful downtown, you have to have housing within 
walking distance and the northern Avenue is not walking distance," Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Buford said he was not enthusiastic about the committee's idea, but 
would wait to hear its arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 Monahan, a lifelong Ventura resident who owns a welding shop on Ventura 
Avenue, said the Avenue neighborhood should never have been cut off from the 
original downtown boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Avenue and the downtown are one and the same," he said. Stretching 
Downtown Boundaries A committee of the Ventura City Council wants to expand the 
boundaries of the city's downtown area to include the upper Ventura Avenue 
neighborhood. The move would allow a developer who is interested in building in 
the Avenue area to qualify for housing allocations set aside for the city's 
downtown. Some council members are objecting to the suggestion,saying the 
Avenue neighborhood is not part of the city's downtown, and that the developer 
should not receive favored treatment.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; PANEL TO CONSIDER REDUCED THEATER 
FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Arndt wants to dazzle every first-grader in the Conejo Valley Unified 
School District with a production of "The Jungle Book" in Thousand Oaks' new 
Civic Arts Plaza in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 But to stage the popular children's musical, he'll need some help. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the board responsible for setting policy at the Civic Arts Plaza 
will consider whether to assist Arndt and others who gear productions toward 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-member commission will vote on whether to halve rental rates at the 
1,800-seat auditorium and 400-seat theater for nonprofit groups that perform 
for students during the school day. 
</P>
<P>
 If the discounts are approved, Arndt's theater group would pay only $900 to 
use the larger auditorium and $200 to perform in the smaller theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the normal rate, we'd be losing money," said Arndt, who chairs Cal 
Lutheran University's drama department. 
</P>
<P>
 The reduced fees are important, he said, because they would encourage the 
production of more shows aimed at students. "If you can get kids into the 
theater when they're young, you can develop an audience that will stay with 
you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Mitze, director of the two theaters, has recommended approval of the 
reduced rates. Besides Arndt's proposal, Mitze has received requests for 
discounts from the Ventura County superintendent of schools (for an Adventures 
in the Performing Arts series) and the Conejo Valley Children's Concert Series. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission meeting will start at 7 p.m. at Thousand Oaks City Hall.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; COLLEGE GIVES $13,000 TO HELP BUILD 
HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Ventura County chapter of Habitat for Humanity has received a $13,000 
donation from Cal Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks to help build a house 
for a needy family, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 About $10,000 will be used to help pay the $65,000 cost of building a home on 
Beall Street in Thousand Oaks, said Lynda Fulford, a Cal Lutheran 
spokeswoman.The remaining $3,000 is earmarked for other Habitat for Humanity 
projects in Ventura County, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks City Council agreed earlier this month to deed the vacant 
Beall Street lot to the nonprofit group. It will be the first home built in the 
east county by the philanthropic group, said Bruce Wallick, who is leading the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction will not begin until Habitat officials have satisfied the 
concerns of some neighbors, Wallick said. Some Beall Street residents have 
complained to city officials that their neighborhood had no room for another 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 Habitat for Humanity prepared an Oak View home for a low-income family last 
year, Wallick said. A family of four must earn less than $27,600 to qualify for 
a Habitat home, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran's student-run chapter of Habitat for Humanity raised the money at 
a concert last fall, Fulford said. Students in the group help build houses 
abroad each spring, but this will be the first time they have assisted in 
constructing a home nearby, she said. KAY SAILLANT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; SCHOOL TO HOST COMEDY BENEFIT

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Parent-Teacher Organization of Summit School in Ojai will sponsor a comedy 
night Saturday to raise money for playground equipment at the kindergarten 
through sixth-grade school. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled for 7:30 to 10 p.m. at the Ojai Women's Club at 441 E. Ojai Ave., 
the fund-raiser will feature performances by two professional comedians: Jerry 
Swallow and Cary Odes.Odes' credits include televised performances at the 
Improv comedy club in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Reservations are required for the event. Cost is $12.50 per person, including 
refreshments and a cash bar. 
</P>
<P>
 The comedy night was the idea of Parent-Teacher Organization President Valerie 
Levett, who said she is an old friend of Odes. 
</P>
<P>
 Levett asked Odes if he would perform for free at the benefit. He not only 
agreed but enlisted help from fellow comedian Swallow. 
</P>
<P>
 All the money raised at the event will go toward completing a playground at 
Summit School that the Ojai Unified School District could not afford to build. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parent-Teacher Organization has built part of the playground with a $5,000 
loan from the school district, which the organization is trying to repay. The 
parents' group needs an additional $8,000 to buy more equipment for the 
playground, Levett said. 
</P>
<P>
 To make reservations or for more information on the comedy benefit, call 
Levett at 525-2626 or Lauren Deneen at 646-2162. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CITY TO FILE TAX LIEN ON FAILED CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Oxnard will file a $4.4-million tax lien on the failed Oxnard Town 
Center to protect bondholders who helped fund $14.7 million in improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 A portion of the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of the Town Center planned 
for June would pay off the delinquent bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to file a lien, made Tuesday by the Oxnard City Council, comes 
nearly six years after the city agreed to provide municipal services to the 
center. Proposed by Oxnard Town Center Partners of Solvang, the $500-million 
center was supposed to include a mix of office high-rises, retail shops and a 
cultural arts center. 
</P>
<P>
 With the $14.7 million in bond revenues, the city built streets and storm 
drains, provided water and electrical service, installed street lighting and 
planted landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 But the project foundered during the county's economic downturn, after just 
two of the center's planned buildings had been constructed on the property 
north of the Ventura Freeway near the Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
 The developers backed away from the project and stopped paying the bondholders 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Gary Gillig said Tuesday that the city of Oxnard is not at risk by 
the default on the bonds, which were issued by a council-directed community 
facilities district with the property offered as collateral. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillig said an "impenetrable wall" exists between the district and the city, 
making the city's general fund safe from claims by holders of the delinquent 
bonds. PATRICK McCARTNEY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; DRIVER ARRESTED AFTER FATAL CRASH 
</P>

<P>
 A family trip to play in the snow in the mountains above Ojai ended in tragedy 
when an alleged drunk driver smashed into an approaching car on California 33, 
killing a 6-year-old boy and injuring four others, California Highway Patrol 
officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard residents Clara Servin and her fiance, Roman Cerda, were returning 
about 5 p.m. Monday from the mountains, where they had taken Servin's three 
sons to play in the snow, when their vehicle was struck by a car driven by 
Edmund Castro of Meiners Oaks, CHP Officer Mark Thomas said. Castro had swerved 
into the opposite lane, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Servin's son, Sergio Ramirez, 6, who had been riding in the back seat, 
suffered major head injuries in the crash and was taken to Ojai Community 
Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, according to the CHP. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergio's brothers, Daniel Albarran, 8, and Charles Albarran, 10, who were also 
sitting in the back seat, suffered moderate injuries, Thomas said. Servin 
suffered numerous abrasions to her head and face and a probable concussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerda, who was driving the vehicle, suffered a broken arm and a fracture to 
his lower back, Thomas said. He was treated and released from Ojai Community 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro, 34, was arrested by CHP officers on suspicion of felony drunk driving 
and taken to Community Hospital, where he received stitches for a cut on his 
forehead. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said preliminary tests indicated Castro's blood-alcohol level to be 
.164, which is twice the legal limit. Results of a formal blood test will be 
released later this week, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro, who is being held at Ventura County Jail in lieu of $5,000 bail, is 
expected to be charged with felony drunk driving and manslaughter, Thomas said. 
He is scheduled to be arraigned at 1:30 p.m. today in Municipal Court, 
authorities said. TRACY WILSON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; DEAD MAN'S INJURIES UNDER INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 36-year-old Ventura man who was found dead in his living room may have 
suffered fatal injuries during a robbery and beating 24 hours earlier, police 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although coroner's officials said Thomas Edward Shoop died of a ruptured 
spleen, they have not yet classified the death as a homicide pending further 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're out looking . . . to see if we can narrow down what he was doing in the 
period between the robbery and his death to see if anything else could explain 
the trauma and the injuries," Sgt. Bob Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects in the robbery, Jose Luis Sanchez, 24, and Carlos Tapia Garcia, 
34, both of Ventura, are being held in County Jail in lieu of $100,000 bail. 
They were booked on suspicion of robbery and are scheduled to appear today in 
Ventura County Municipal Court for arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives are expected to confer with the district attorney's office today 
about the possibility of filing additional charges against the two. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoop was robbed about 5 p.m. Sunday as he walked near Harrison and Olive 
streets in west Ventura. He told police that two men asked him for a cigarette, 
then offered to sell him rock cocaine. When he declined, they dragged Shoop out 
of sight, kicked him repeatedly and stole $15. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez and Garcia, who matched the suspects' descriptions, were arrested half 
an hour later when a patrol officer spotted them. Shoop identified them as his 
attackers, and officers recovered some cash from the men, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoop was found dead about 6:30 p.m. Monday. A man selling magazine 
subscriptions went to Shoop's door on West Center Street and saw a body in the 
living room. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said there were no signs of a struggle in Shoop's living room. Shoop 
was medically disabled and had no relatives in Ventura, he said. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; SUSPENDED COACH FACES NEW ALLEGATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura Unified School District plans to file additional accusations today 
against the former Ventura High School swim coach accused of having sex with 
two students, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials refused Tuesday to give details of the new allegations to 
be filed against former coach Dale Hahn, they said they hope that the 
additional accusations will bolster the district's case for firing him. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn taught chemistry and coached the water polo and swim teams at Ventura 
High for 20 years before he was put on leave with pay in the fall. He was 
suspended without pay in January. 
</P>
<P>
 To fire Hahn, the district must present its allegations against him at a state 
hearing, which will be held in Ventura in July, school district attorney Mary 
Jo McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
 In initial allegations filed in January, the district said the teacher had sex 
with two students -- a girl who graduated in 1989 and another who was enrolled 
at the school as recently as the fall. The district also alleged that Hahn made 
advances and sexually suggestive comments to students and that, despite 
repeated warnings, used profanity while coaching the water polo and swim teams. 
</P>
<P>
 But school officials are concerned that their case may be weakened by a state 
law that forbids districts from firing a teacher for actions that took place 
more than four years ago, McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
 That law could prevent the district from using as evidence the testimony from 
a young woman who said she had sex with Hahn while she was a Ventura High 
student in the fall of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the district has also accused Hahn of having sex with a student last 
fall, that allegation was based on a male student's testimony about a female 
friend. The male student has so far refused to identify the girl, and no female 
student has stepped forward to verify the story, McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to reach Hahn for comment Tuesday were not successful. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; ARMY'S PLAN TO TEST MISSILES QUESTIONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A small group of environmentalists and commercial fishing interests Tuesday 
questioned a U. S. Army plan to test the next generation of Patriot missiles by 
firing them at target missiles over the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 The testing would involve 100 missile launches from Vandenberg Air Force Base 
and San Nicolas and San Clemente islands between 1994 and 2000, U. S. Army 
Major Thomas McWhorter said at a hearing in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The testing will have a hell of an influence on fishing out there," said 
Terrell Cryer of the Ventura County Commercial Fisherman's Assn. "It will 
affect the small fishermen like myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Godley of the Earth Island Institute opposed the Army's plans to test 
missiles over ocean waters rich with marine mammals. "Why does it have to be 
conducted over one of the most pristine environments in the world?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the Army's environmental review of the proposed tests, the hearing was 
held to solicit public reaction to the use of the offshore testing range, the 
only California site of four under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 If the testing is conducted from what the Army calls the Western Range, 
unarmed target missiles would be launched from ships hundreds of miles off the 
Southern California coast. The Army would then fire several types of advanced 
interceptor missiles at the targets from Vandenberg and the two islands. 
Another test would include the firing of a surface-to-surface missile from 
Vandenberg to San Clemente Island. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent harming the islands' rich marine mammal populations, McWhorter said 
the tests would not be conducted during the breeding season. 
</P>
<P>
 The 45-day comment period on the preliminary environmental impact statement 
expires March 28. Comments should be sent to David Hasley, U. S. Army Space and 
Strategic Defense Command, Attn: CSSD-EN-V, P.O. Box 1500, Huntsville, AL 
35807-3801. For information, call (800) 603-3030. PATRICK McCARTNEY

 Ventura Fire Chief Vern Hamilton announced Tuesday that he has accepted a job 
as fire chief for the city of Milpitas in Northern California.  
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton, who has been fire chief in Ventura for a little more than three 
years, begins the new job April 4.He wants to move because he and his wife Pat 
miss the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to go back home," Hamilton said. "I think I underestimated the impact 
of being so far away from my lifelong friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Fire Chief Ken Hess will be made acting fire chief until Hamilton's 
position is filled.  
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton, 46, was raised in Oakland and began his career in firefighting at 
the Watsonville Fire Department. He was Watsonville's fire chief from 1971 to 
1984. He then moved to Napa's Fire Department, where he served as fire chief 
from 1984 to 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton moved in 1991 from Napa to Ventura, where he heads a department of 
about 75 firefighters. His base salary is $88,703. 
</P>
<P>
 In Milpitas, which has a population of about 51,000, Hamilton will begin at 
$101,520 and head a 65-member department. Hamilton will replace retiring 
Milpitas Fire Chief Mike Harwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Milpitas officials said they picked Hamilton from 90 applicants after a 
four-month nationwide search. PEGGY Y. LEE

SIMI PROPOSAL TO TEACH BIRTH CONTROL DEBATED; EDUCATION: OPPONENTS SAY 
ABSTINENCE ALONE MUST BE TAUGHT. SUPPORTERS ARGUE THAT STUDENTS NEED COMPLETE 
INFORMATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDA DAY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dozens of Simi Valley parents, students and residents took part in an 
emotional and sometimes heated debate Tuesday over whether to allow schools to 
teach birth control methods to seventh- and 10th-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 70 opponents and supporters of the proposed sex education program 
testified before the board of the Simi Valley Unified School District, which 
was scheduled to decide the issue late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over whether to include birth control information in student course 
work has been at the center of increasing controversy ever since school board 
member Debbie Sandland first proposed the idea in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents said abstinence alone should be taught as the only sure way to 
protect against pregnancy and disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to start thinking of the root, not the symptoms," said Ginny 
Murray, one of several dozen parents who have spoken out at board meetings 
since last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the plan to add birth control information to the sex education 
curriculum argued that students need to be given complete information to make 
good choices based on their own values. 
</P>
<P>
 Programs that stress only abstinence promote "fear and shame of premarital sex 
because, bottom line, sex before marriage is viewed as immoral, period," said 
Paige Moser, a coordinator for the Simi Valley chapter of the National 
Organization for Women. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Tuesday's board meeting, about a dozen students held a candlelight 
vigil outside City Hall to honor those who have died from AIDS and to show 
their support for the proposed curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wisest person on the Earth couldn't make a wise decision without all the 
facts," Katie Hall, a sophomore at Royal High School who participated in the 
demonstration, said later in her testimony before the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Father John Love, a priest at St. Rose of Lima Church, said educators 
should not assume that students will become sexually active. Instead, he said 
abstinence should be raised as the ideal for students to seek. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is abstinence possible?" Love said. "I'm 31 years old. I'm celibate. I've 
lived a celibate life all my life and I have not exploded." 
</P>
<P>
 The ideological clash over the district's sex education curriculum first began 
when the idea was proposed in April by Sandland. After the board had conducted 
a routine review of the curriculum, the first-term board member said she found 
the lack of birth control information disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
 A 25-member committee was convened to discuss when and what kind of 
information students should receive about birth control. However, the diverse 
committee was not charged with deciding whether to add the information to the 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, the committee unanimously recommended introducing basic birth 
control information to the seventh-grade sex education class and expanding the 
discussion for high school sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee also recommended delving more into how students can develop 
skills for staying abstinent, such as learning how to resist peer pressure and 
boost self-esteem.

APPROVAL EXPECTED FOR SIMI ARTS CENTER PLANS; CULTURE: PANEL'S VOTE TONIGHT 
COULD PAVE THE WAY FOR 70-YEAR-OLD CHURCH'S CONVERSION INTO A PERFORMANCE 
VENUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Simi Valley's plan to convert a 70-year-old church into a 300-seat theater is 
expected to be approved by the Planning Commission tonight, clearing the way 
for construction of the city's first full-fledged cultural arts center. 
</P>
<P>
 The design for the center was approved by the City Council on a 3-2 vote in 
August, and officials said the major impediments to the plan's passage have now 
been addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm confident that the plan is going to be well-received by the other 
commissioners," said Michael Piper, a planning commissioner and member of a 
committee formed to look into the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the only issue that's outstanding at this point is parking, and I'd 
like to see us work through that and push the project ahead," Piper said. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the center would include the theater and banquet facilities, and 
a 78-space parking lot. Piper said there was concern that the parking lot would 
not be large enough for a sold-out performance at the 300-seat theater. 
</P>
<P>
 But city planners said in a report that the existing lot, combined with space 
at a nearby school, would provide enough parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking was one of a number of concerns that consultants, architects and city 
staff have grappled with since 1991, when the city bought the building at 3050 
Los Angeles Ave. for $821,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The building, which opened in 1924 as the Simi Valley Community Methodist 
Episcopal Church, has gone unused since it was purchased, and it will require 
extensive work to bring it up to today's codes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy City Manager Bob Heitzman said the wood-framed structure withstood 
January's earthquake with only minor damage. The city has not had to change its 
original cost estimate of $2.8 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern about locating the theater's entrance across from a fire station and 
the potential for traffic to affect the Fire Department's response time has 
been addressed by fire officials, Heitzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan now calls for limited parking on adjacent Church Street, clearing 
access for firetrucks. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of programming and fund raising for the proposed center, members of 
the Simi Valley Cultural Assn. said they plan to contribute time and energy to 
keeping the facility booked. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We are thrilled with the idea of having a theater right here in Simi Valley 
so that we don't have to drive over the hill into Los Angeles," said Irene 
Silbert, an association board member. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that in a community of 100,000 plus, having a cultural arts center 
is a necessity," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Silbert said she believes that the center will attract local performers and 
traveling acts. Its smaller size will help it distinguish itself from the 
larger Civic Arts Plaza being built in Thousand Oaks, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really looking to fill a niche that has gone unfilled for too long," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is approved, the center could be completed as early as January, Heitzman 
said.

COLLEGE ROUNDUP; UC RIVERSIDE BEATS TITANS, STOPS WINNING STREAK AT 11 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Doyle's single with two outs in the bottom of the ninth drove in Sean 
Kicherer to give host UC Riverside a 7-6 victory over Cal State Fullerton 
Tuesday. The loss stopped the Titans' 11-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton led, 6-5, entering the bottom of the ninth. Riverside had two on and 
two out when Titan relief pitcher Ted Silva struck out Dan Redington. But 
catcher Brian Loyd's passed ball allowed Redington to reach base, and after 
Silva hit third baseman Scott Laverty to tie it, 6-6, Doyle delivered the 
game-winning hit. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-ranked Titans (12-2) rallied for two runs in the ninth inning on a 
suicide squeeze by designated hitter Bret Hemphill and a sacrifice fly by Jim 
Betzsold. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Ferguson had two hits and scored two runs and Hemphill, Brian King, 
Jeremy Giambi and D.C. Olsen each had two hits each for Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle led Riverside (9-3), an NCAA Division II school, with two hits and two 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 In Golden State Athletic Conference men's basketball: 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California College 74, Point Loma Nazarene 71 -- Danin Bryant scored 
26 points and gave out six assists for the Vanguards. Eric Carmichael added 16. 
Southern California is 15-15, 3-8.Point Loma Nazarene is 13-15, 5-6. 
</P>
<P>
 In nonconference softball: 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman 8-5, Whittier 2-4 -- Lisa Simpson had a triple and a home run and Moe 
Caryl went two for three, with two RBIs and two runs scored in the first game 
for host Chapman (8-2).

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / MIKE DIGIOVANNA: BASEBALL SCHEDULE OFFERS 
CHALLENGES

 No. 1 vs. No. 2: So much for that "Just Another Game" attitude most athletes 
have toward premier regular-season matchups. Mike Parisi, ace for the 
second-ranked Titan baseball team, doesn't deny it -- Sunday's start against 
top-ranked Georgia Tech in the Anaheim Hilton & Towers tournament final at 
Titan Field will be one of his biggest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be as excited as I was when I pitched against Louisiana State in the 
1992 regionals," said Parisi, a junior right-hander who is 3-0 with a 1.24 
earned-run average. "I'm going to work real hard this week to get ready." 
</P>
<P>
 A sweep of the tournament -- Fullerton plays San Diego Friday and Oklahoma 
Saturday -- would vault the Titans (12-2) who had won 11 in a row before losing 
to UC Riverside Tuesday, into the top spot in national polls. But that's not a 
concern for Fullerton coaches at this point. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at it as another test to see how we compare to other top teams," said 
George Horton, associate head coach. "In the big picture, the reason we 
schedule teams like Georgia Tech, Arizona and Texas is to develop players, get 
used to the best competition and prepare us for post-season play." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the mark: After a two-year delay, the Titan track and field team will play 
host to its first meet in the Titan Sports Complex Saturday when UC Santa 
Barbara and UC Irvine visit at 12:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 A striper who was painting lanes in November, 1991, discovered the track was 
about 7 feet too long, and the problem was finally corrected this winter when 
the east turn was virtually rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton Coach John Elders has been busy with last-minute details -- securing 
officials, borrowing equipment from UCI, getting the lanes painted and the 
discus cage installed. He has done much of the work himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be lucky to be alive by the end of the week," Elders said. "But I'm real 
excited about this weekend. Every race will be a stadium record." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chip off the ol' block: Fullerton basketball fans might notice a familiar face 
in the movie, "Blue Chips." Former Titan center Sean Williams is a teammate of 
Shaquille O'Neal and appears in many of the locker room scenes, in a 
non-speaking role. 
</P>
<P>
 There was only one glimpse of Williams, who wears No. 31, in an action shot, 
but don't feel bad for the 6-foot-10 center, who is now playing professionally 
in Brazil. He made $200 a day for a month last summer when the movie was 
filmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Titan Coach Brad Holland took his team to see the movie last Friday, the night 
before a game at New Mexico State. Reviews weren't good. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made some good points, but overall, I don't think the movie was very 
good," Fullerton assistant Chris Brazier said. 
</P>
<P>
 And what about Williams? 
</P>
<P>
 "Sean was Sean." 
</P>
<P>
 Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The field for next year's Anaheim Hilton & Towers baseball tournament at Titan 
Field will consist of Fullerton, Texas, Pepperdine and Notre Dame. Said Titan 
Coach Augie Garrido: "The Upper Deck Tournament brings the best high school 
teams here, and now we have something like that at the college level. It's good 
for baseball in Orange County." . . . Mate Borgogno, an infielder on 
Fullerton's 1992 College World Series team, is now the baseball coach at Los 
Altos High, and Rich Gonzales, the left fielder on that team, is an assistant 
baseball and football coach at Diamond Bar High. . . . Jeff Maes (126 pounds) 
will take a 24-5 record and Christian Holiday (158) will take a 24-8 record 
into this weekend's Pacific-10 Conference wrestling championships at Cal Poly 
San Luis Obispo. . . . Shayla Bradshaw had an outstanding week, scoring 43 
points to lead the Titan women's basketball team to victories over Nevada and 
UC Santa Barbara. . . . Heather Killeen, one of the Big West Conference's top 
distance runners, will miss at least the first half of the track season because 
of a strained tendon in her hip, an injury she suffered at the end of the 1993 
cross-country season.

CONDEMNED GYM DOES NOT DAMPEN HIGH EXPECTATIONS OF PIERCE MEN; COLLEGE 
VOLLEYBALL: BRAHMAS SHOULD CONTEND FOR WSC TITLE DESPITE PRACTICING OR PLAYING 
AT FIVE OFF-CAMPUS LOCATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Virtual vagabonds, the men's volleyball players at Pierce College are ready to 
begin Western State Conference play tonight at a place they can't call home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brahmas have been practicing at three sites because their gym was 
condemned after the Jan. 17 earthquake. Still, they have high hopes heading 
into the 7 p.m. match against Santa Monica City at the Valley College women's 
gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce won the Long Beach City College tournament last week and Coach Ken 
Stanley anticipates another strong season. The Brahmas were 15-4 last year and 
tied Long Beach City for the WSC title before losing in the semifinals of the 
Southern California regional. In 1992, Pierce won the state championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't challenge for the conference championship, I'll be disappointed," 
Stanley said. "I think we can be a good blocking team and I think we have some 
pretty good (hitting). I like our physical ability." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brahmas have prepared for the season under difficult circumstances. The 
Brahmas will play their home matches at Valley College or Taft High and have 
been practicing from 5:45 a.m. to 8 a.m. on weekdays at Pepperdine, Valley and 
Agoura High. 
</P>
<P>
 The schedule has been demanding, to say the least. "It's not very much fun, 
that's for sure," Stanley said. "It's almost like being an off-campus coach. 
I've been so worried about getting a place to practice and play that I feel 
like I haven't been on top of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the Brahmas are outside hitters Branden Higa, a 6-foot-4 sophomore 
from Quartz Hill High, and Brad Schultz, a 6-3 freshman from Van Nuys High. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other projected starters are Gabe Higa, Branden's brother, a 6-4 
opposite hitter and transfer from Irvine Valley College. Higa played basketball 
but no volleyball at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Nash, a 5-10 freshman setter from Chatsworth High who is a converted 
outside hitter, has won a starting job. Also slated to start are Felipe 
Placencia, a 6-2 freshman outside hitter from Ventura High, and Jason Rang, a 
6-3 redshirt freshman middle player from Bend, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 Two returning sophomores, 6-5 middle blocker Pete Blied and 6-foot outside 
hitter Jean Masquesmay from Monroe High, will play reserve roles. Also helping 
will be freshmen Mark Smith, a 6-foot setter from Lakewood, Colo., Cesar 
Gutierrez, a 6-2 opposite hitter from Cleveland High and Kevin Barnett, a 6-7 
opposite hitter.

 Washington's Wayne Sevier is the leading candidate to replace Howard Tippett 
as the Rams' special teams coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Zygmunt, Ram senior vice president, confirmed the team had contacted 
Sevier, who is considered one of the NFL's top special teams coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Sevier said Tuesday night that he has met with Ram Coach Chuck Knox and that 
"we're on track for something to happen real fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Sevier, 52, coached on two Super Bowl championship teams with the Redskins and 
three NFC championship teams. He was with the Redskins from 1981-86, then 
coached two seasons with the San Diego Chargers before returning to the 
Redskins in 1989.

<P>
 The Rams signed tight end Robert Brasher, who was on Detroit's practice squad 
last season, and safety David Wilson, who was on Minnesota's practice squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, 5 feet 10 and 192 pounds, was a seventh-round draft pick by the 
Vikings in 1991. Brasher, 6-5 and 244 pounds, originally signed with San Diego 
as a free agent in 1993. MIKE REILLEY and T.J. SIMERS

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: INGLORIOUS EXIT BY HART SUSTAINS JINX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senior forward Randy Roa cited typical culprits -- poor shooting and inability 
to adjust to a zone defense -- for second-seeded Hart High's quick exit from 
the Southern Section Division I-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Roa, who averaged 11.9 points and led Hart with 12 Saturday night in the 
Indians' second-round, 65-49 loss to Palmdale, said the biggest factor might be 
a playoff jinx. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never seem to get past the second round," Roa said. "It was in the back of 
my mind. I had to block it out. But as time was running down, I said to myself, 
'I can't believe this is happening again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hart won Foothill League championships in 1992 and 1993 but lost in the second 
round of the playoffs both seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that Hart, the area's No. 1-ranked team by The Times for most of the 
season, was facing a decided underdog in the second round after a first-round 
bye. Palmdale was 23-3 and lost to Hart by three points in December. But Roa 
cited the Bermuda Triangle effect: Hart disappears in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got the shots we wanted, but we just missed them," Roa said. "We had the 
height advantage, but it seemed like they were getting all the rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Me, Brian (Ballew) and Eric (Spindt), we couldn't believe it. It didn't seem 
right. We expected so much from ourselves. We had a great season. We were one 
of the best Hart teams ever. I thought we were peaking. I thought we would be 
making it to the finals." 
</P>
<P>
 Spindt said the Jan. 17 earthquake also contributed to Hart's misfortune. 
Because of freeway damage and the cancellation of four league games, the 
Indians missed a chance to set the school record for victories (25) and might 
not have drawn Palmdale in their first playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably wouldn't have had Palmdale in our bracket," Spindt said, "but 
(the Southern Section) decided to seed teams geographically because of the 
earthquake. But that's no excuse for us losing." MARMONTE LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 The Best-Laid Plans . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Channel Islands girls' basketball team was seeded second in the Southern 
Section Division I-A playoffs and aiming for an eventual championship matchup 
with its nearby rival, top-seeded Buena. 
</P>
<P>
 Those plans crashed after a surprising 55-53 second-round loss to Cerritos on 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We blew it, royally," Coach Don Salado said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 53-53, the Raiders fouled a Cerritos player at the top of 
the lane as she was beginning to drive to the basket. The two Cerritos free 
throws ended the Raiders' season. 
</P>
<P>
 Salado did not hang the loss on that play because his team committed many 
uncharacteristic mistakes, including a technical foul and two turnovers when 
the inbound passer stepped over the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darn it," Salado said. "We kind of let things slip away." MID-VALLEY LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Identity Crisis 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Jose Fernandez, you just guided Sylmar to its first basketball league 
title in the school's 33-year history. Guess the Spartans are the big guys on 
campus now, huh?  
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth, I don't know if anybody knows," Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got football here and the girls' basketball team is doing incredibly 
well. . . . I don't think anybody is aware of it." EAST VALLEY LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Dynamic Duo 
</P>
<P>
 Grant Coach Howie Levine calls brothers Ron and Don Patterson an unexpected 
gift, packaged twice. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're the greatest thing that's happened to me since I've been at Grant," 
Levine said. "They are just great kids. They work hard, they've got great 
heart. . . . They're just fabulous." 
</P>
<P>
 Levine was happy to have the Patterson brothers when the basketball season 
opened. Now, eight games since leading scorer and rebounder Rick Forscutt moved 
to Utah, Levine is ecstatic about his dynamic duo. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Patterson, a 6-foot junior guard, has been on a scoring tear since 
Forscutt moved last month. Ron is averaging 18.6 points in the past eight 
games, nearly twice as many as his 11.3 average through the first 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Patterson, a 6-1 sophomore, pulled down 16 of the Lancers' 32 rebounds in 
a two-point overtime loss to North Hollywood. He is averaging 12.2 rebounds in 
his last five games. Around the Leagues . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * North Hollywood has won 33 East Valley League games without a loss since 
seniors Fantasia Johnson and Damon Ollie made the team as sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mid-Valley League boys' basketball teams make up 25% of the City Section 3-A 
Division playoffs, including Sylmar (8-4 in league play), Poly (7-5), Monroe 
(7-5) and Birmingham (6-6)). 
</P>
<P>
 * Birmingham's Tony Silberfeld has taken 31 charging fouls in 17 games. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quartz Hill freshman Jackie Johnson had 50 points and 30 rebounds in the 
Rebels' two Division I-A playoff victories last week. Against Rialto on 
Saturday, the 6-foot center had 26 points and 20 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Newbury Park, giant killers: On Feb. 8, the Panthers girls' basketball team 
ended Channel Islands' 20 game-winning streak and finished the regular season 
21-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park was rewarded with a Division III first-round playoff game against 
last season's champion, Morningside. Undaunted, Newbury Park defeated the 
Monarchs, 42-32.

ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: BOYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Al Lairson 
</P>
<P>
 SCHOOL: Palmdale 
</P>
<P>
 SPORT: Basketball 
</P>
<P>
 YEAR: Senior 
</P>
<P>
 SEASON AT A GLANCE: Lairson has been perhaps the Falcons' most consistent 
player, according to Coach Garry Phelps. Lairson, who averages 15.6 points and 
5.7 rebounds a game, also was an excellent receiver on the football team. 
</P>
<P>
 WEEK AT A GLANCE: Lairson scored 23 points and made eight of 11 shots from the 
field in Palmdale's 65-49 second-round playoff victory against Hart, which came 
into the game with a 21-1 record and a No. 1 ranking in the Times' regional 
poll. Lairson added six rebounds, three assists and three steals. The victory 
avenged one of Palmdale's three losses, a 55-52 defeat to Hart in December. 
Last week, Lairson also had 28 points and nine rebounds in Palmdale's 108-69 
victory against Temecula Valley in the first round.

DIVISION II-A; TUSTIN SWITCHES ITS STRATEGY TO DEFENSE TO OVERCOME KATELLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sagging zone defense and some late free throws allowed Tustin to defeat 
Katella, 56-44, in the second round of the Division II-A boys' basketball 
playoffs Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory, Tustin's 10th in a row, puts the Tillers in Friday's 
quarterfinals against Pasadena Muir. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin's offense dominated in a 97-56 victory over Los Amigos in the first 
round last Friday, but its defense helped conquer Katella. The Knights led, 
10-9, after one period but struggled on offense the rest of the way as the 
Tillers (21-7) built a 31-17 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Tustin managed just 11 of 27 (41%) in the first half, it limited 
Katella to 7 of 24 (29%) shooting. Katella, which managed just three of eight 
free throws in the half, also committed 10 turnovers to only four for Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 The absence of point guard Tommy Burfeind, who missed the game after 
dislocating his knee in the Knights' opening-round victory over Valencia, 
didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
 Katella (16-9) made a run in the fourth quarter. After Tustin's Rafi 
Lalazarian hit two free throws to give the Tillers a 46-31 cushion, Tustin went 
more than five minutes without a field goal. Katella cut the lead to 46-39 on 
LaByron Clayton's three-point play with 3:50 remaining, but got no closer as 
Tustin used free throws by center David Lalazarian and guards Doug Gottlieb and 
Greg Logan to clinch the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Gottlieb finished with a game-high 18 points. David Lalazarian, who converted 
11 of his 13 free throws, had 17 points and eight rebounds. FORREST LEE

SERVITE'S DOWNS TAKES OVER IN VICTORY; DIVISION III-AA: HIS BIG RUN IN THE 
FOURTH QUARTER IS ENOUGH TO DEFEAT MAGNOLIA, 66-57, AND ADVANCE TO THE 
SEMIFINALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The game finally came to David Downs. He had watched others carry Servite 
through three quarters. Now it was his turn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt great," Downs said. "I felt unstoppable." 
</P>
<P>
 He was. 
</P>
<P>
 Downs lifted the Friars to a 66-57 victory over Magnolia in the quarterfinals 
of the III-AA boys' basketball playoffs Tuesday at Villa Park High School. They 
will play Sonora in the semifinals Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to make it to the finals," Downs said. 
</P>
<P>
 He started that big push in the fourth quarter. He scored 12 of his 19 points 
in the final quarter, including a three-minute stretch in which he scored 10 
consecutive points. 
</P>
<P>
 When Downs' run was done, Servite (19-8) had a 60-47 lead with four minutes 
left to cruise home. 
</P>
<P>
 Downs, a 6-foot-5 forward, scored on post moves, jumpers and even a jump hook. 
He basically made life miserable for Magnolia's Todd Callahan, the man assigned 
to guard Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt we had a mismatch there," said Kevin Reynolds, Servite's acting 
coach. "That kid was either going to play defense or give up shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Downs streak extended Servite's season, which was foundering at one point this 
season. Head Coach Scott Hamilton was suspended after an altercation with an 
game official following a Sunset League game against Marina. The Friars were 
3-2 in league play. They have won eight of 10 since. 
</P>
<P>
 "We told the kids that we were going to get back to having some fun," Reynolds 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sentinels (19-8), the fourth-seeded team, never found their stride. They 
are a team that likes to run-and-gun, but they ran and threw the ball away 
instead. Servite forced 21 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friars' Kieran Betts caused a lot those problems, as he forced Frankie 
Henderson, Magnolia's leading scorer, into one bad shot after another. 
Henderson scored 19 points, but made only five of 14 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friars led, 34-24, at halftime. Kristian Vallas carried the load, scoring 
scoring 15 of his game-high 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon Hearvey, Magnolia's 6-6 center, scored 13 points to keep the Sentinels 
close. He was finally neutralized by Mark Seaton, the Friars' 6-9 center, who 
blocked four shots in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Downs did the rest.

DIVISION I-AA; LONG BEACH WILSON GETS THE JUMP ON LOS ALAMITOS  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The game's most telling statistic jumped out at Los Alamitos Coach Steve 
Brooks, much like Long Beach Wilson's players had jumped over his team all 
night: 18 offensive rebounds for Wilson, five for Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave them way too many second and third opportunities," Brooks said. "When 
you let them get that far into your defense, you're going to have problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos' rebounding problems led to a 65-58 Wilson victory in the 
quarterfinals of the Southern Section Division I-AA boys' basketball playoffs 
at Huntington Beach High. The Bruins' victory sets up a semifinal with 
cross-town rival Long Beach Poly. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos (22-5), seeded second in the division, led throughout the fourth 
quarter, but Wilson forward Michael Batiste's three-pointer from the baseline 
with 1 minute 40 seconds left gave the Bruins a 58-56 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos center Brady Doyle (18 points, nine rebounds) made a layup to tie 
it, but they were the Griffins' last points of the night. Ali Ton could have 
given Los Alamitos the lead, but he missed the front end of a one and one with 
1:09 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Batiste (30 points, 10 rebounds, three blocks) took over from there, scoring 
five of the game's last seven points and making a block on Doyle as he appeared 
to have an easy score-tying layup with a minute left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins' Tim Lin had a chance to tie it at 61 with 20 seconds left, but 
his hurried three-point attempt wasn't close. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos made eight of 13 free throws, but missed its last two. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're usually people that don't normally miss free throws," Brooks said. "As 
a team, we shoot over 70%." 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins normally rebound better too, but they weren't prepared for 
Wilson's athleticism and were beaten 33-24 on the boards. Even when it appeared 
Los Alamitos had everyone blocked out, a body would come flying in to tip or 
dunk the ball in. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have played teams as athletic as these guys, but they were coming from the 
top and sometimes, they came out of nowhere," said Brooks, whose team also had 
eight shots blocked. "Our perimeter guys just didn't do a good job of blocking 
them out." 
</P>
<P>
 Lin finished with 16 points on four three-pointers, but he missed his last 
three attempts and never had much room to operate.

SANTA ANA VALLEY HOLDS ON WITHOUT MANN, BEATS AYALA

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite playing without leading scorer Olujimi Mann down the stretch, Santa 
Ana Valley beat Chino Hills Ayala, 68-64, in a Division I-AA boys' basketball 
quarterfinal game Tuesday at Century High. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-seeded Falcons (26-3) play Crescenta Valley, which upset top-seeded 
Fontana, in a semifinal Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons led by as many as 21 points in the third quarter, but Ayala 
rallied to within nine at the end of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 John Holmes then opened the fourth with six consecutive points and Ayala 
trailed, 58-55. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, Mann fouled out with 5 minutes 53 seconds remaining and the 
Falcons leading, 60-56. Mann scored a game-high 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayala (22-5) took advantage of Mann's absence, scoring six consecutive points 
to take its first lead, 62-60. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Santa Ana Valley then scored its first points in more than four 
minutes when Carlos Quezada hit a three-pointer with 2:20 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 After Santa Ana Valley's Jermaine Robinson made one of two free throws, 
Holmes' steal and layup tied the score, 64-64, with 36 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Michael Riggins scored on an uncontested layup with 30 seconds 
remaining, giving Santa Ana Valley its final lead. DAN ARRITT

SIMON LEADS MATER DEI PAST VALLEY VIEW

<P>
 Miles Simon scored 21 points to lead Mater Dei to its 29th consecutive 
victory, a 70-44 triumph over Moreno Valley Valley View in the Southern Section 
Division I-A boys' basketball quarterfinals Tuesday at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley View kept the game close for most of the first half and tied the score, 
22-22, before Mater Dei scored the final eight points of the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Baskets by Darren Hite, Schea Cotton and two by Simon gave the Monarchs a 
30-22 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles (17-9) made one last run at the Monarchs early in the third 
quarter, cutting the lead to 35-30 before the Mater Dei defense took over. Two 
steals by Simon during a 14-2 run gave Mater Dei a 48-32 lead late in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've played together for the past couple of years and were able to 
penetrate our defense in the first half," Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight said. 
Valley View was 10 of 17 from the field in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei held a 19-14 lead at the end of the first quarter after scoring the 
final four points. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton scored 15, Clay McKnight scored 12 and Shaun Jackson 11 for the 
Monarchs, ranked second in the nation by USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Englebrecht led the Eagles with 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory moves Mater Dei into the semifinals against Los Angeles Loyola 
Friday at a site to be announced. MIKE WOJCIECHOWSKI

DIVISION I-A; CHARGERS COOL OFF PANTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Edison didn't know a lot, but it knew about the threes. 
</P>
<P>
 Going into its Division I-A Southern Section quarterfinal boys' basketball 
game against Orange Tuesday night at Estancia High, Edison had done enough 
homework to know the Panthers could shoot accurately from as far away at they 
need to. 
</P>
<P>
 But through a combination of cold shooting by Orange and Edison's 
stand-and-deliver defense, the Chargers took care of the Panthers' usually 
lethal outside threat and won, 63-53. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew they had some good three-point shooters, so we wanted to try to knock 
those down and not let them get any baskets in transition," Edison forward 
Micah Kroeger said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers (18-9) were successful enough on both counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Gil Gonzales, who averaged 14 points during the regular season and scored 24 
against in a second-round game against Corona Friday, was held to a paltry four 
points -- all on free throws -- and was zero for 11 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lived or died by perimeter shooting all year long, and we died by it 
tonight," Orange Coach Richard Bossenmeyer said. "I don't know if it was their 
defense or our shooting. . . . It was our coldest shooting all year, but you 
have to give them credit. They did a good job on us." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange broke the 24-24 halftime tie with a quick three-pointer by forward Pat 
Harris, who scored a game-high 21 points. But consecutive inside baskets by Ali 
Tofighi, Darrell Adams and Kroeger and two free throws by Kroeger gave Edison a 
32-27 lead. Orange (23-4) pulled back to within two, but after three quarters, 
the Chargers led, 40-37. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the fourth, with Edison leading, 43-39, Kroeger had a steal and was 
fouled during the easy layup that appeared to extend the Chargers lead to six. 
But officials didn't see the shot go in and Edison settled for the two-shot 
foul. Kroeger made one of the free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 After Adams connected on a long three-pointer, Edison had one of its biggest 
leads of the night, 47-39, but Orange wasn't folding. 
</P>
<P>
 Nestor Cabalo went on a mini streak and scored his third three-pointer of the 
quarter with 46 seconds remaining and hit a free throw to pull the Panthers to 
56-52. But all Orange could do was foul Edison and by then, the Chargers were 
hitting both ends of their free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeger, who finished with 19 points and 10 rebounds, credited Ben Beard (17 
points, 10 rebounds) for his rebounding in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without Ben pulling down those offensive boards, we would have been down by 
six or seven at the half," he said.

DIVISION II-AA; OILERS' OTHER GUYS DO SOME DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Huntington Beach's convincing 81-69 victory over Trabuco Hills Tuesday 
night, the Oilers' all-everything player Tony Gonzalez didn't deliver the most 
damaging blows. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure Gonzalez had 30 points and 13 rebounds, but teammate Matt Malmquist made 
five three-pointers to help the hot-shooting Oilers (19-9) take an 11-point 
halftime lead and set the tone for their Division II-AA second-round boys' 
basketball playoff victory at Trabuco Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers, who shot 65% (30 of 46) from the field, advanced to the 
quarterfinals to play second-seeded Inglewood, a 70-45 winner over Compton, 
Friday at a site to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew Gonzalez would get his points," Trabuco Hills Coach Rainer Wulf said. 
"We wanted to make sure to defend everyone else, but Malmquist scores 17 in the 
first half and that really deflated our bubble. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anyone thinks Huntington Beach is a one-man team they're mistaken." 
</P>
<P>
 Malmquist, a 6-foot-2 senior guard, helped take some of the pressure off 
Gonzalez with his 25 points. He made five of six from three-point range. 
Backcourt-mate Vasili Hatziris had two points and seven assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach forward Clay Chilcott came off the bench to score 15 points, 
making 12 of 13 free throws in the fourth quarter to ice the game. 
</P>
<P>
 While Chilcott, who had one three-pointer, and Malmquist worked the perimeter, 
Gonzalez scored from everywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-6, 230-pound senior, who has signed to play both basketball and 
football for California next season, had four dunks, two tip-ins, and even one 
three-pointer. He had 19 points at halftime and made 14 of 18 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers didn't miss much in the final three quarters, making 22 of 28 (79%) 
from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been playing well," Huntington Beach Coach Roy Miller said, "and we had 
to to keep up with Trabuco Hills. If they get on a roll, you better be able to 
do something on offense." 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Warnick had 25 points and Ryan Karnoff added 21 to lead the Mustangs 
(22-6), who drew to 66-61 with 5 minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 But Trabuco Hills missed its next seven shots and the rally fizzled as 
Chilcott began making his free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most times this season, we came through in those situations," Wulf said. "But 
it's hard to keep coming back like that." 
</P>
<P>
 In another Division II-AA game: 
</P>
<P>
 Glendora 58, Ocean View 53 -- Kevin Johnson scored 16 points and Mike Carney 
added 12 for host Ocean View, which finished the season 14-15. Cameron Murray, 
brother of Portland Trail Blazer Tracy Murray, had 30 points for Glendora 
(26-2).

DIVISION III-AA ROUNDUP; SAVANNA GOES TO BOARDS, KNOCKS OFF SECOND-SEEDED RIM 
OF THE WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Savanna's front-line tandem of Dan Avila and Todd Wilson combined for 26 
points and 25 rebounds as the Rebels upset Lake Arrowhead Rim of the World, 
63-45, at Western High to advance to the third round of the Southern Section 
boys' basketball playoffs for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Savanna (15-11) dominated the Scots, seeded second in Division III-AA.The 
Rebels led, 29-22, at halftime, and outscored Rim of the World, 17-3, in the 
third quarter to take a 46-25 lead. Wilson, who had 18 points, fueled the run 
with three consecutive baskets in a span of 1 minute 25 seconds midway through 
the quarter.  
</P>
<P>
 The Rebels controlled the boards and limited the Scots to one shot per 
possession. Avila finished with 17 rebounds and Wilson had eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Savanna, which defeated Murrieta Valley, 72-70, in overtime last Friday, will 
play Santa Margarita in the semifinals Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rebels' large margin of victory surprised Coach C.D. Snider. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm shocked," he said. "I never imagined anything but a two-point win for us, 
if that. They had an off night shooting and we did what we needed to do to win 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Plagued by poor shooting, Rim of the World never led. The Scots were forced to 
foul early in the fourth quarter. But Jermaine Moore made eight of nine free 
throws to help the Rebels maintain their lead.

<P>
 Long Beach Poly's James Brown took an off-balance shot from the top of the key 
that rolled around the rim and into the basket at the buzzer to give the 
Jackrabbits a 50-48 victory over Fountain Valley in the Southern Section I-AA 
boys' basketball quarterfinals Tuesday night at Edison High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown broke loose for a last ditch shot after Poly took the ball out of bounds 
with seven seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley (23-6) nursed a small lead most of the fourth quarter and led, 
48-45, on Daniel Keller's basket with 2:16 remaining. But Poly's Damon Dawson 
made a three-point play on a rebound basket and a free throw with 1:51 left to 
tie the score, 48-48, and set the stage for Brown's heroics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did a good job defensively," Fountain Valley Coach Gordon Billingsley 
said. "We contained and slid across and helped out. We just couldn't hang on to 
our leads." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Poly (23-6) will play Long Beach Wilson in Friday night's 
semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons' Phil Domingo led all scorers with 18 points and teammates Keller 
and Brandon Leimbach added 13 apiece. Chris Hardy led Poly with 17 points. 
Fountain Valley shot 61.8% from the floor on 21-34 shooting. TOM BIRSCHBACH

<P>
 Pacifica used a 35-point third quarter and a full-court press to beat Pasadena 
Blair, 84-74, in Southern Section III-A boys' basketball quarterfinals Tuesday 
night at La Canada High School 
</P>
<P>
 Center Jon Surface was perfect from the floor in the third quarter that saw 
the Mariners (25-1) outscore Blair by nine. Surface was six for six, including 
two three-pointers and two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing 38-34 at halftime, the Mariners tightened their full court pressure, 
which allowed Blair point guard Jecarl Riggins to score 16 first-half points 
and build the Viking lead to as much as 15 in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 After trading baskets early in the second half, Pacifica forced three 
consecutive turnovers. Surface's three-pointer and free throw tied the score, 
60-60, with 1:13 left.  
</P>
<P>
 Jaimi Bessho hit a three-pointer off the next Viking turnover to give the 
Mariners the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair held Pacifica's Chris Vlasic to only three points. Vlasic was 1 for 10 
from the field, and didn't score a point in the Mariners' big third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Surface finished with a game-high 38 points and Erik Maurer added 11 for 
Pacifica. 
</P>
<P>
 Riggins scored 31 points and Dan Cadd added 17 for Blair (18-9). 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica will face La Canada in a semifinal game Friday at site to be 
determined. JON CLIFFORD

SOUTHERN SECTION BOYS' SOCCER PLAYOFFS; ESPERANZA AGAIN SENDS CHAVEZ'S TEAM 
PACKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 El Toro Coach Bob Chavez probably hopes he never plays Esperanza or Coach Ken 
Oaxaca again. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season in the semifinals, Esperanza defeated La Puente Bishop Amat, 2-0, 
with Chavez as coach. This season in the second round of the Southern Section 
Division II boys' soccer playoffs, Esperanza (16-5-5), the defending Division 
II champion, beat the Chargers, 4-3, in sudden-death overtime at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza plays Long Beach Millikan Thursday in a quarterfinal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs never led until they pulled out the victory 4 minutes 30 seconds 
into sudden death. Mike Morales, going one on one with goalie Jason Pitts, put 
the ball into the left corner of the net.  
</P>
<P>
 "The kids played the last 20 minutes with real heart," Oaxaca said. "The way 
they came back today, we can beat anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro (18-4-5) scored first on Ricky Le's goal 15 minutes into the game. The 
Chargers seemed to be in control for most of the first half behind the speed 
and ballhandling of Le and Deiter Segura. But the Aztecs tied the score on 
Aaron Pugmire's goal with five minutes remaining in the half. Jason Wolfe got 
the ball in front and was tripped up. Pugmire recovered the ball and scored the 
first of his two goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten minutes into the second half, El Toro took the lead again, 2-1, when Jose 
Lopez scored over goalie Jaeson Fikse. But the Aztecs came back. Standing in 
front of the goal, Pugmire put a header in the corner out of Pitts' reach with 
15 minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was the Chargers' turn again. With 10 minutes left in regulation, 
Simon Vanderweide put a goal into the right side giving El Toro a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to the kids after (El Toro) scored and I told them if we can score 
right now, we'll win it," Oaxaca said. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's what Esperanza did. With five minutes left in regulation, Wolfe 
scored with a header off a throw in to tie it, 3-3. Twenty-four minutes later, 
Morales put it away. MELANIE NEFF

VICTORY OVER LOS ALAMITOS

<P>
 Canyon flattened the Los Alamitos girls' soccer team, 4-1, in the second round 
of the Southern Section Division II playoffs Tuesday at Canyon High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon, which last season lost in the Division II title game, will play 
Kennedy, a 1-0 winner over Long Beach Poly, in a quarterfinal Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with a four-goal lead at the half, Canyon Coach John Williams was 
nervous. "I never really felt comfortable, because Pacifica scored four times 
on Los Alamitos and lost (6-4 in the first round)." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither team had a good shot on goal until 15 minutes into the first half, 
when Laura Flatauer's attempt bounced off Griffin goalie Lynsey Salsbury, and 
Genelle Geronsin kicked it in around a group of players in front of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comanches (16-5-3) scored again on a goal by Kim Nelson 19 minutes into 
the game. Nelson scored after a crossing pass from Ingrid Anderson. Three 
minutes later, Jacquie Bannister's shot from about 15 yards hit the goal post 
and Flatauer followed it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before the half, Krista Broughton kicked the ball over Salsbury's head 
into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos (17-3-3) scored 15 minutes into the second half when Sarah Bickel 
headed in Andrea Sievers' pass. HEATHER STEVENS

 Outlook: Villa Park and Foothill have owned the league since 1978, with 
Foothill winning the title 10 times to Villa Park's five. In the 1990s, Villa 
Park won the first two years, Foothill the past two, including the Knights' 
92-78 advantage in the dual meet last year. Expect another another dogfight 
this year, both coaches predict. Cornue, who was first at the section meet in 
the 100-yard freestyle and second in the 200 free, is considered one of the 
best swimmers in the county. Matt and his brother, Peter, a sophomore, were 
all-league water polo players. All-American Matt had the 12th-fastest 200 free 
and the 22nd-best 100 free in the nation in 1993. Freestyle and backstroke are 
strong events for the Spartans; breaststroke is a weak link.

 Outlook: After only two years, during which he coached Laguna Hills to a

meet, Rohan Taylor moved to Australia to coach water polo. Assistant Duncan, 
who was an All-American when he swam for Costa Mesa (1984-86), takes over the 
successful Hawks' program, which returns Hammontree (first, 200-yard free; 
second, 500 free), Mark Kwok (second, 200 individual medley; second, 100 free)

championship effort. Mark's brother Matt, a breaststroker and competitor in the 
individual medley, should fill in blanks left by Mendi Dalavarian and Dustin 
Burns.

 Outlook: The Diablos made a strong run at the Division I championship, but 
Marina's mega-depth sank their chances. What Mission Viejo lacked in team depth 
was made up in individual efforts: Robert Delgado won the 100-yard butterfly, 
Peter Struglinski was the 100 breaststroke champion and Jason Hubbart won in 
diving. This year, Mission Viejo will have about as much depth as last year, 
and still has individual threats in Kaup (fifth, 50 freestyle), Filsoof (fifth, 
200 freestyle; eighth, 100 butterfly) and Kyross (sixth, 100 backstroke). Any 
Diablo team wouldn't be complete without a Polish swimmer. Bart Sikora, part of 
the Diablos' famous Polish connection, had to sit out last year because of 
eligibility requirements, but will suit up this season.

 Key newcomers: Allen Basso, Jr.; Aron Brown, Sr.; Derek Flenniken, Jr.; Bill

</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Loss of backstroker John Simmons, now at SMU, is a big one. He was 
the only Charger to win an individual title at the section meet (200 free), but 
El Toro has the experienced Pyka, Reaves and Tilton to pick up much of the 
slack. El Toro can earn valuable points through diver Routson, the youngest 
member of the U.S. national team, who missed last year's section meet because 
of a national team commitment. Water polo players Stout, The Times Orange 
County's Player of the Year, and Pinciroli, the Southern Section Player of the 
Year, add speed and depth.

 Their bodies were willing. Their minds were able. Their times were sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 But their unity was suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Halfway through the 1993 season, members of the Woodbridge boys' swim team 
stopped, checked out the lane lines and felt something was wrong with this pool 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 As Andrew Lazenby and Tunch Doker, senior co-captains of the 1994 Warriors, 
saw it, something wasn't quite right, and they approached Coach Dan Gaines with 
their proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of the problem, they felt, was alienation between club and non-club 
swimmers. Why not, as a goodwill gesture, bring the two camps together? 
</P>
<P>
 "Tunch and I spoke to Dan about needing more team unity," Lazenby said. "We 
felt all the other teams would be stronger against us because they had more 
(unity) than we did." 
</P>
<P>
 The bringing together of the two sides started with a meeting, during which 
each group aired its feelings about team togetherness, or lack of it. Soon 
afterward, club members -- most of Woodbridge's club swimmers belong to 
Novaquatics -- began to meet with the non-club swimmers twice a week to give 
lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaines said the actual lessons were "incidental. The fact that they were there 
made all the difference in the world to the younger swimmers." 
</P>
<P>
 Us and them became we. 
</P>
<P>
 "There used to be a sense that the club swimmers were more elite," Lazenby 
said. "But hey, we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the high school swimmers. 
By showing we cared about them, we get along much better. We've had some fun 
picnics, done things outside of the competitive life." 
</P>
<P>
 Within the competitive circle, it's hard to find anyone who isn't picking 
Woodbridge to medal at the Division I Southern Section meet this May, on the 
heels of the Warriors' 1993 fourth-place finish and with their returners. 
</P>
<P>
 The swimmers' expectations are equally high. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's goal is to win CIF, win league, win every invitational, go 
undefeated," said junior Dawson Hughes. "Everybody's talking about it. There's 
a lot expected of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Those expectations surfaced as early as 1991, when Hughes was an 
eighth-grader, and Doker was already looking into the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember taking to Tunch back then and he was saying how good our team 
would be his senior year," Hughes said. "My freshman year, we had all the same 
people we have now, they just weren't as fast. Then, we got Derya." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of Derya. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Much of the exposure -- you could say ruckus -- that has surrounded Woodbridge 
the past two years has centered on Turkey's Derya Buyukuncu, the swimmer Doker 
was partially responsible for in bringing to America. 
</P>
<P>
 As a 1992 Turkish Olympian, Buyukuncu was already an established swimmer. But 
after he set a national high school record in the 100-yard backstroke last 
season, one would think he's Woodbridge's lone athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's done a lot for our team," Doker said. "Most people hear Woodbridge and 
they think, 'Oh, that Turkish guy.' It's not just Derya who will win a meet, 
it's the whole team. But he has won a lot of recognition for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors, though, seem to understand that publicity for Buyukuncu means 
publicity for Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't feel overshadowed by him," Lazenby said. "We respect that he's here. 
He's one of the top swimmers in the United States. Having him at practice gives 
us someone to chase, so it's good for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, most team members paid attention exclusively to junior and senior 
nationals as their big meets. This year, the section meet is the event of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope it's our big meet," Doker said. "Knowing that we have a good chance 
to win, we'll have more confidence than last year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors have other motivating factors. Teammates Hughes, Lazenby, Doker, 
Sean and Mike Moore and Ethan Yotter have been swimming together for as many as 
eight years. Those left want to make sure they go out in style. 
</P>
<P>
 But they are painfully aware that teammate Sean Moore, a vital link to their 
section championship hopes (in the 100 breaststroke and the 200 individual 
medley) won't be around come title time. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, a member of the junior national team, will be in Paris representing the 
U.S. in a dual meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's going to hurt," several team members echoed. Boys' Swimming and Diving

<P>
 Notes: Division I -- Last season, overlooked Marina snared the section 
championship from Mission Viejo, a team gunning for its 16th title. Marina, 
which didn't have an individual champion but qualified a swimmer in every final 
but one and whose 200-yard free relay upset the Diablos, pulled it off, 
186-152. But the Vikings lost Matt Braun, Jon Kenyon, Jason Klick, Brian Akian, 
Phillip Steuber and diver Ernie Higbee (second), an extremely heavy graduation 
toll. . . . Division II -- Sonora, Freeway League runner-up to Sunny Hills, 
came within a wing and a prayer of the section championship, largely from the 
efforts of graduated Jernej Seljak and Jay Judson, but the Raiders still have a 
strong core of returners.. . . . Division III -- Brea-Olinda, winner of four 
consecutive Orange League championships and eight of the last nine, expects 
another top finish. "First," Coach Dave Wright said. "If we don't, we screwed 
up or something went wrong. Very wrong." . . . Defending Pacific Coast League 
champion Trabuco Hills is strong in the butterfly, individual medley and sprint 
events, but weak in distance and breaststroke.

 Outlook: Irvine probably won't improve much from its dual-meet season from 
last year, but because of its depth, the Vaqueros should have a good league 
meet. The league title is a toss-up between Corona del Mar, Irvine and 
Woodbridge, but Dory believes Irvine's deep bench will help give it the edge. 
"Woodbridge has two great guys, but when depth counts, we have four good guys," 
he said. Lezak, a two-time All-American and top-four section finisher in the 
50- and 100-yard freestyles, and Ronson, the only freshman to score in two 
events at the championship meet (50 freestyle and 100 breaststroke), anchor the 
Vaqueros' hopes.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; SPOTLIGHT ON THE 
PHILIPPINES; SOME TIPS ON PHILIPPINE TRAVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL SMITH, CAROL SMITH is a free-lance writer based in Pasadena. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Philippines is expecting a dramatic increase in business travel over the 
next few years as the Southeast Asian marketplace continues to outpace growth 
in many other parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourist arrivals in Manila were up 20% to 25% last year, with nearly 19% of 
them coming from the United States, said Jose Ebro, a spokesman for the 
Philippine Embassy in Washington. That figure includes people traveling on 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philippine Embassy and the Philippine Department of Tourism in Los Angeles 
consider the country safe for those traveling to business locations. However, 
there are areas of the country that are considered unsafe for travel. For 
example, insurgent and criminal activity make traveling unsafe on Samar Island, 
in rural areas of Panay Island and in the interior regions of Negros Island, 
according to the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs. Certain 
provinces in northern Luzon and in the Mindanao region are also considered 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 For current information on travel advisories and areas of instability, call 
(202) 647-5225. In general, short-term business travelers in major urban areas 
or tourist sites are at less risk of becoming targets of terrorism than are 
long-term residents or U.S. officials. Business Zones 
</P>
<P>
 The major business destinations in the Philippines, outside of Manila, are the 
"industry estate zones," also known as "processing zones." These are areas 
designated for development by the Philippine government with tax incentives to 
attract foreign investment. Companies such as Texas Instruments, Motorola and 
Intel, as well as a number of multinational textile and food-processing giants 
have set up bases of operation in these zones. 
</P>
<P>
 The major processing zones are Cagayan de Oro, a strong agricultural center on 
the island of Mindanao; Baguio in the north, on the main island of Luzon, which 
attracts the microchip processors because of its low-dust, cooler environment; 
the island of Cebu, site of a number of Japanese manufacturing firms; Subic, a 
former U.S. military installment on Luzon, which has been converted to a 
business zone, and Cavite, also on Luzon. 
</P>
<P>
 All the processing zones except Cebu and Cagayan de Oro are accessible by bus 
or car. Subic, for example, is about a three-hour drive from Manila, while 
Cavite is a little more than an hour away. Cebu and Cagayan de Oro are 
reachable by plane; daily flights from Manila take about 45 minutes to Cebu and 
1 1/2 hours to Cagayan de Oro, according to Rusty Ricaforte, regional director 
of the Philippine Department of Tourism in Los Angeles. Getting Around 
</P>
<P>
 The major airline serving the Philippines both internationally and 
domestically is Philippine Airlines. Air travel within the country is 
relatively inexpensive, so flights are usually full; tickets should be 
purchased in advance. In addition to PAL, there are two domestic carriers, 
Pacific Asia Airline and Aero Lift, which offer more limited service. 
</P>
<P>
 Car rentals are available through the large hotel chains, and the roads are 
manageable for even first-time business travelers. A good map is a necessity. 
The "Southeast Asia Handbook" by Carl Parkes (Moon Publications) recommends the 
"Republic of the Philippines Roadmap" published by the National Bookstore. It 
is available in most Manila bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 In Manila, it's preferable to take a taxi or hire a driver, Ebro said. The 
embassy recommends that first-time visitors get a cab through their hotel, 
which typically screens the drivers. Also, all the major hotel chains have 
shuttles from Ninoy Aquino International Airport, which is about 12 kilometers 
away. Unlicensed or so-called pirate cabs can be a problem at the airport, so 
it's best to arrange transportation in advance or take a hotel shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, Golden Cabs (black with gold lettering) or EMP cabs (white with 
yellow stripes) are reputable companies. Make sure the meter is working in any 
cab you take. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeepneys, the Philippine form of mass transportation -- "with the emphasis on 
mass," said Ebro -- are colorful converted buses, jeeps and carts and are not 
recommended for business travelers. Neither are trains, which have not been 
well-maintained in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus system, however, is adequate and buses are air-conditioned, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When using any form of public transportation, be aware that pickpockets are 
common. Be alert if someone tries to distract you by pointing at your clothes 
as though you have spilled something or by asking you for directions. 
Pickpockets often work in teams. Also, Knockout drugs are easy to get and may 
be used to rob travelers, so don't accept free coffee or beer from strangers. 
Doing Business 
</P>
<P>
 One of the advantages of doing business in the Philippines is that you will 
seldom need an interpreter. Although the national language is Tagalog and there 
are more than 70 dialects spoken throughout the islands, about 90% of the 
population speaks English. Spanish is also commonly spoken. 
</P>
<P>
 When planning a business day, take into account that many Filipino business 
executives start their days early with breakfast meetings. They tend to get to 
their offices by midmorning. Lunch ends about 2:30, so midafternoon is another 
good time to catch people in their offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Filipinos are familiar with U.S. business customs, and, like Americans, they 
tend to conduct business at lunch and dinner meetings or on the golf course.  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike in America, however, the meeting is not considered concluded once the 
business portion is out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The business relationship is not considered complete until it is friendly," 
Ebro said. Hotels 
</P>
<P>
 "All the major hotels have business rooms with fax and computer capabilities," 
Ebro said. And as long as you are in urban centers or industrial zones, the 
phone system works fine.  
</P>
<P>
 Phone service in outlying areas is less reliable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recommended hotels for business travelers in Manila include the Holiday Inn, 
Manila Peninsula (part of the Hong Kong-based Peninsula group), the Philippine 
Plaza (part of the Westin chain) or the Shangrila, another Hong Kong-based 
chain.  
</P>
<P>
 The Hotel Nikko, a Japanese chain, caters more to the Japanese business 
traveler. 
</P>
<P>
 For information on hotels near industrial zones, contact the American Chamber 
of Commerce in Manila at 011-63-2-818-7911 or the Philippine Department of 
Tourism in Los Angeles at (213) 487-4525.

Richard Leakey, who speaks at UC Irvine at 7:30 tonight. He lost parts of both 
legs in a plane crash last June, and has offered his resignation as head of the 
Kenya Wildlife Service amid political infighting. . . . But good news: He 
recently won the National Geographic Society's prestigious Hubbard Medal for 
exploration, discovery and research. Among the previous recipients: his 
parents, famed fossil-hunters Louis and Mary Leakey.

 BIPARTISAN AROMA: Who says those folks at the Richard Nixon Library & 
Birthplace aren't fair to Democrats? When White House assistant curator Beth 
Monkman lectured Tuesday, they ordered up the same lunch she says Bill and 
Hillary Clinton served to the prime minister of Japan. If you worry whether 
they eat well on Pennsylvania Avenue: Endive salad with warm shrimp and 
scallops, prime veal, roasted potatoes, baby vegetables, plus apple, mango and 
sour cherry strudel. With custard sauce, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 CHIEF DIPLOMAT: Gayle Anderson is talking up Orange County around the globe. 
Recent stops for the county's chief of protocol include trips to China, Cyprus, 
Israel and Egypt -- not at taxpayers' expense -- to spread the word about 
Orange County businesses. She even arranged a successful audition of a Russian 
operatic vocalist. . . . "I never know who I'm going to meet," she says about 
the job. Saturday, she's back home for the 10th annual Protocol Ball in Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 FULL CIRCLE: If you're from Cypress College, get ready for a group hug today. 
A big one. . . . Campus officials have asked students, faculty and staff to 
gather near the duck ponds at 10 a.m. for a 360-degree photograph to include 
everyone, plus the campus. Noted Irvine photographer Kornelius Schorle will 
turn the shot into a 50-foot color print, to be displayed somewhere on campus. 
And should it rain? Says a spokeswoman: "We just won't let that happen."

 CROWDED ICE: Skategate spells Greatgate for at least one Valley ice rink. 
Attendance for skating sessions, which goes up during every Winter Olympics, is 
even larger because of the Harding-Kerrigan controversy. . . . The Iceoplex in 
Van Nuys has turned away hundreds in recent days. "Unfortunately, Tonya and 
Nancy has been a negative thing," said an Iceoplex official, "but it's been 
great business." 
</P>
<P>
 METRO STOP: Today might be decision day for where the Metro Rail stop in 
Universal City winds up. MCA wants the station, currently on Lankershim, closer 
to its CityWalk attraction, while the county argues the move would be too 
costly and time-consuming. . . . Both sides hope to present a compromise today 
before the county Metropolitan Transportation Authority board. (B1) 
</P>
<P>
 LOST BOY: Let's give Kennedy High's Jeff Taylor, 14, the benefit of the doubt. 
He can't help it that he's been out of school for five weeks because the quake 
did so much damage (above). On his first day back Tuesday, looking for his 
temporary classroom, Jeff showed he's been away too long. "(Someone) told me 
that way was south, so I figured that the other way was north.". . . He wasn't 
the only one confused. (B1) 
</P>
<P>
 JACK OF CLUBS? Either a Los Angeles man is seriously mistaken or we have 
figured out what Jack Nicholson is doing when not acting or attending Laker 
games. . . . Robert Scott Blank has filed a lawsuit claiming Nicholson got out 
of his Mercedes at a Studio City intersection earlier this month and struck 
Blank's Mercedes several times with a metal pipe or golf club. (B1) 
</P>
<P>
 COME HOME: The city of Santa Clarita has something to ask residents who fled 
their earthquake-damaged mobile homes: Where are you? . . . The city wants to 
let them know that FEMA has agreed to pay for placing many structures back on 
their supports. One problem: Officials can't find residents to offer the help.

 CABLE RATES: Ventura County cable providers responded cautiously to the 
Federal Communications Commission's order that cable television rates be 
slashed by 7% -- on top of a 10% cut last April. (D1) The April cuts, aimed at 
reducing rates, in some cases did the opposite. . . . Ventura County 
Cablevision President David La Rue said it was too soon to assess the FCC's 
decision. . . . Ventura's Avenue Cable is awaiting a ruling on the fairness of 
its rates. "Any time there's talk of revenue being reduced, it's going to 
affect our ability to provide service," said manager Stephen George.

 IN TREATMENT: Chicago White Sox pitcher Scott Radinsky has returned to his 
home in Simi Valley after having a malignant lymph node removed from his neck. 
Radinsky, 25, will begin chemotherapy and radiation treatments that could last 
eight months. . . . The left-handed reliever played in 78 games last season and 
compiled an 8-2 record. He was a star pitcher at Simi Valley High, striking out 
180 batters in 100 innings his senior season in 1986 (C1).

 POWER SHIFT: Ventura County Supervisor Vicky Howard's announcement that she 
will not seek reelection could signal a power shift on the board (B1) . . . . 
Howard's surprise move, after Supervisor Maria VanderKolk's decision not to 
seek a second term, leaves two seats open. VanderKolk often sided with 
Supervisor John K. Flynn. . . . "I think next year we'll see a transformation 
of the leadership of the board," Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 COMEDY SELLS: Comedy recordings are making a comeback in the form of CDs (F1). 
. . . "They're definitely selling more than the cassettes," said Brent Harding 
of the Record Outlet in Thousand Oaks. Hot sellers in Ventura County: the Jerky 
Boys, whose recordings of prank phone calls were popular on the underground 
circuit, and Saturday Night Live comedian Adam Sandler. . . . And old standbys 
such as Ray Stevens are still in demand, said Roman Spandrio of Salzer's in 
Ventura.

MARY LASKER; CO-FOUNDER OF MEDICAL RESEARCH AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mary Woodard Lasker, the philanthropist once called the "fairy godmother of 
medical research" who waged a personal war on heart disease, cancer and 
strokes, has died. She was 93. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Lasker, who with her late husband established the Albert and Mary Lasker 
Foundation and the Albert Lasker Medical Research awards, died Monday of heart 
failure at her home in Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lasker Medical Research Award, given for significant achievement in basic 
and clinical medical research, was established in 1944 and is considered second 
in prestige only to the Nobel Prize. Her last public appearance was in October 
at the 1993 Albert Lasker Awards luncheon in New York City addressed by First 
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Believing that "money could buy ideas," Mrs. Lasker sought to reward and 
encourage researchers in combatting the diseases she labeled "major cripplers 
and killers" -- heart disease, cancer and stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 She was considered the driving force behind the creation of the National 
Cancer Institute and establishing adequate funding for the entire National 
Institutes of Health. In 1984, the NIH rewarded her efforts by designating the 
Mary Woodard Lasker Center for Health Research and Education. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, President Lyndon B. Johnson awarded her the Medal of Freedom, and in 
1987 the U.S. House and Senate authorized President George Bush to strike a 
special Gold Medal "in recognition of her humanitarian contributions in the 
areas of medical research and education, urban beautification, and the fine 
arts." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Lasker's more than five dozen awards included the Albert Schweitzer Gold 
Medal for Humanitarianism in Philanthropy from Johns Hopkins University in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 With her husband, Mrs. Lasker amassed an important French Impressionist art 
collection but sold it to finance her philanthropy. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Lasker is survived by her nephew, James W. Fordyce of Greenwich; two 
stepchildren, Francis Brody and Edward Lasker, both of Los Angeles, five 
stepgrandchildren, and two stepgreat-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Memorial contributions may be sent to the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation 
for the Albert Lasker Medical Research Awards program, 870 United Nations 
Plaza, New York, N.Y. 10017.

'PAPA' JOHN CREACH; VIOLINIST WITH THE JEFFERSON AIRPLANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Papa" John Creach, a violinist who studied with members of the Chicago 
Symphony Orchestra, segued to jazz and blues, and wound up playing rock with 
the Jefferson Airplane, Hot Tuna and Jefferson Starship, died Tuesday in Los 
Angeles. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
 Creach died at Midway Hospital where he was being treated for heart and 
respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps best known for his years with the Airplane, Creach last year earned 
the W. C. Handy award as an outstanding blues musician from the Memphis-based 
Blues Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two years, Creach had toured with Jefferson Starship despite 
arthritis and failing hearing. In 1992 he made his first compact disc album, 
"Papa Blues," with the Bernie Pearl Blues Band. The album received widespread 
acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
 One of 10 musically inclined children from Beaver Falls, Pa., Creach first 
picked up a violin -- his uncle's -- at age 10. Eight years later, when the 
family moved to Chicago, Creach studied with symphony players but also 
discovered jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing in small bands and cocktail trios throughout the United States and 
Canada, Creach often had trouble making his violin heard. But in 1943, National 
Steel introduced the electric violin, an instrument Creach would make his own. 
</P>
<P>
 The result enabled Creach's rapid-fire, be-bop bursts of notes and graceful 
slides through the upper registers to stand out anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Creach settled in Los Angeles in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 He played small clubs for a couple of decades until Joey Covington brought 
members of the Airplane to hear him at the Parisian Room in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Covington, who later joined the band as its drummer, nicknamed Creach "Papa" 
to emphasize the irony of a white-haired mid-50ish fiddle player performing 
with the young rockers. 
</P>
<P>
 Creach is survived by his wife, Sylvia (Gretchen) Creach, a former 
schoolteacher who managed his band, as well as two brothers and a sister.

GUN WATCH; TARGET PRACTICE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As if mounting an expensive, taxpayer-financed election to recall Sen. David 
A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) less than 10 months before his term ends -- in large 
part because of his support for tighter gun laws -- wasn't appalling enough, 
the suggestion that this effort should extend to state judges is positively 
chilling. Yet that is precisely what may be on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 A confidential document dated Feb. 5, outlining strategy for the Roberti 
recall campaign, also suggests that the campaign itself is an effort to "prove 
the viability of a technique that can be used to cut the Gordian knot of the 
Supreme Court" around the Second Amendment. While federal judges, including 
those on the U.S. Supreme Court, have lifetime tenure, state judges stand for 
reelection. And since, as the document explains, some state judges do land on 
the federal bench, ". . . we can certainly put the fear of God" in them before 
they become immune to recall.  
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Daily Journal reported last week that one of the leaders of 
the recall campaign admitted that his group, Californians Against Corruption, 
has discussed the issue. "Something we have talked about recently is the 
potential for recalling a (particular) judge." The campaign memo goes further: 
"We are already investigating a potential judicial target." 
</P>
<P>
 A recall election is meant to remove officials who violate the law, abuse the 
public trust or cannot carry out their duties. State judges who uphold 
California's minimal gun-control laws in the face of such threatened harassment 
deserve a medal -- and reelection, not recall.

WHO'S KEEPING UP WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY?; ATTITUDES: THOUGH MANY FEEL LEFT BEHIND, 
MORE THAN HALF IN SURVEY ARE SATISFIED WITH THEIR COMPUTER KNOWLEDGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost half of U.S. adults and a majority of those over the age of 35 say the 
advance of technology is leaving them behind, according to an Associated Press 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll shows widespread agreement that computers and electronic devices have 
made life easier, and 57% of the respondents say they are satisfied with their 
level of technical know-how. But even among the satisfied, three in 10 people 
say they feel left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those who say they are not keeping up, half have used a computer at a job 
and 31% have used a computer in their home. Two-thirds of that group are 
dissatisfied with their level of technical know-how. 
</P>
<P>
 What they say they are most lacking to better keep up with technology is 
knowledge (36%), money (24%) and time (21%). A smaller share, 16%, say they 
lack the desire to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, those who think they are technologically adept are most likely 
to cite money as what they need to continue to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those in the poll, 59%, say they have used a computer at a job, and 
42% have used one at home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The most dramatic variation in the results is among those who say computers 
and electronics have made life easier -- 63% overall, 71% of those under age 
45, and 35% of those over 65. Only 9% think electronics made life harder; the 
rest think it's the same. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority, 53%, say they are keeping up with technology, and 46% say they are 
being left behind. Fewer than 1% are uncertain. Just over half of those past 
age 35 feel left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups most likely to say they are keeping up are men, those with family 
incomes over $50,000 a year, people in metropolitan areas and, of course, 
people who have used computers. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of respondents under 65 have used a computer at work, but the 
percentage who have used a computer at home varies from 57% of those under 35 
to 34% of those ages 55 to 64 and 11% of those over 65. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid excluding computer enthusiasts who tie up their phones with on-line 
services, the poll had up to four callbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Associated Press poll on technological change was taken Feb. 9 through 13 
among a random sample of 1,002 adult Americans in all states except Alaska and 
Hawaii. Interviewing was done by telephone by ICR Survey Research Group of 
Media, Pa., part of AUS Consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 The results were weighted to represent the population by key demographic 
factors such as age, sex, region and education. 
</P>
<P>
 No more than one time in 20 should chance variations in the sample cause the 
results to vary by more than 3 percentage points from the answers that would be 
obtained if all Americans were polled. This margin of sampling error is larger 
for responses of subgroups, such as age categories. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other sources of potential error in polls, including the wording and 
order of questions.

AFRICA A LIFELONG FOCUS FOR NEW U.S. BANKING ENVOY; FINANCE: AFRICAN 
DEVELOPMENT BANK POST CONTINUES ALICE M. DEAR'S 24-YEAR INVOLVEMENT WITH THE 
CONTINENT'S COMMERCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER ALAN HARPER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alice M. Dear remembers looking curiously at a photograph covering a wall at 
the Senegalese mission to the United Nations. Someone explained to her that the 
young child with the large belly was underfed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here I was, a sociology major, traveling around the world, and I didn't 
recognize a symptom of malnutrition," she said. "At that moment, it made me 
more aware of the disparity in the world of developing countries." 
</P>
<P>
 That moment 24 years ago helped define Dear's career. It carried her through 
professions that ranged from flight attendant to entrepreneurial importer to 
global banker. 
</P>
<P>
 But always there was the underlying theme of underdeveloped Africa. Now she's 
in a direct position to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the Senate unanimously confirmed Dear as the new U.S. 
representative to the African Development Bank, a 75-nation group that lends 
money and provides technical assistance to Africa's underdeveloped economies. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear, 46, brings to the job fluency in French, still widely spoken in the 
former French colonies of Africa. She also brings a widespread respect from her 
acquaintances in the banking world. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is well-suited for that job, more so than other people coming to it," 
said Herbert Whiteman Jr., a vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, they have to learn some form of international banking. She's 
already been in that arena and knows several of the players," he said. "She's 
young enough to be enthusiastic and old enough to have the proper experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Dear's enthusiasm can be traced to her childhood. She was voted most likely to 
succeed by her high school classmates in Gary, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 She dabbled successfully as an entrepreneur in importing African crafts. She 
was a banker at Irving Trust (now part of the Bank of New York) for 11 years, 
concentrating on the Middle East and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear said she hopes to put her imprint on the African Development Bank's 
agenda. She spoke in an interview before her departure to the bank's 
headquarters in Abidjan, the capital of the Ivory Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I am bringing together important skills, sensitivity and exposure 
that will allow me to make a unique presentation," Dear said. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, Dear said she would scrutinize the bank's portfolio of loans to 
assess their quality, or the ability of the borrowers to repay. She also said 
she wants American businesses to understand the investment opportunities in 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 She said another priority is to "focus on gender issues, making certain that 
women have access to funds and technology for economic development so they can 
play their role in economic development." 
</P>
<P>
 Dear has embraced African culture as part of her life. She favors African 
dress at diplomatic and business events. She rooted herself in a house in 
Harlem, crammed with African art from her many trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking around her living room, at its masks, paintings and sculpture, Dear 
said it makes her feel as though she were in Africa, where "I feel relaxed, I 
feel very much at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Before she was confirmed, government officials had to talk to people in each 
of the 40 countries she's visited in recent years. Friends describe her as 
"Miss African Development." 
</P>
<P>
 Dear's regular travels to Africa began after she graduated from Howard 
University with a degree in sociology and joined Pan American World Airways as 
a flight attendant. Pan Am later made her expertise available to Air Zaire as a 
technical assistant, where she took an interest in banking and running a 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 First, she realized that understanding finance was important to development. 
Also, "the way in which the airline was being run made me say to myself: 'This 
is no way to run an airline.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She enrolled in Pace University's graduate business school in New York and got 
a dose of what it was like to run a business herself. Dear teamed up with a 
former housemate, Gloria Harper Dickinson, who now is chair of the African 
American Studies Department at Trenton State College in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the mid-70s, we had a brainstorm that was 15 years too early, to start an 
African import business," Dickinson said. During their travels to the 
continent, they had been "impressed with the variety of products in Africa. We 
were disturbed by the quality of products imported to the States. They were not 
the same," she said. "Why were they importing this junk?" 
</P>
<P>
 But after two years of conventions and weekend shows, all while both were 
studying, "It got to the point where we said: 'This is crazy. We can't be 
packing and unpacking these packages on the weekends.' We just stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Pace, she spent 11 years at Irving Trust, rising to vice 
president. She could see how money was used for private development. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throughout my career, there was a conflict because there I was, in a 
commercial bank with a development banker's heart," Dear said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very much bound by country limits, by the profile of the loan portfolio 
the bank wanted to maintain. While I was pressured, I recognized my presence 
made a difference. I was able to make the bank pay attention to Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 Her diplomatic life developed simultaneously with her professional life. She 
became the Non-Governmental Organization representative to the United Nations 
for the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority and led her sorority chapter in donating 
money and time to helping villages and women in Africa through Africare, a 
Washington-based group devoted to rural development in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her chapter was way ahead of everyone else. It's a chapter of dynamic women," 
said Melvin P. Foote, coordinator of the Constituency for Africa, an 
organization affiliated with Africare. 
</P>
<P>
 But even among those women, Dear stood out. Foote recalled thinking, "Wow, who 
is this woman? She's connected to all kinds of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Davis Joseph, public affairs officer for the African-American 
Institute in New York, said Dear's passion for Africa was well known within the 
New York African American community. 
</P>
<P>
 "She walks her talk. She's promoting Africa all the time in conscious and 
realistic terms. She's very pro-Africa, she's very pro-America too," Joseph 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Dear says her career prepared her for the African Development Bank 
position, she did not initially seek it. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert White, a friend and former banking colleague now a vice president at 
Network Solutions Inc., a Herndon, Va.-based consulting firm, was the catalyst 
behind Dear's appointment, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 White said he was called by President-elect Clinton's staff seeking African 
American appointees and had to convince Dear she could get the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "She took it and ran with it. She put together her own campaign to get her 
into the position," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 On a mantle in her Harlem home sits a photograph of the Clintons and Dear, the 
President's arm around his nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 "She really cares about Africa; she knows the issues and knows how America 
works," Joseph said. "She's not just a political appointment."

GOOD REASONS REMAIN TO INVEST IN, START TAX-SAVING IRAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHET CURRIER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When you shop the market for individual retirement accounts these days, it's 
easy to get nostalgic for the good old days of IRAs. 
</P>
<P>
 That era was the mid-1980s, when just about everybody with income from a job 
could make tax-deductible contributions, and financial services firms were 
bidding eagerly for customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Double-digit yields were everywhere, even on low-risk investments like 
certificates of deposit. Promotional come-ons often added extra money to the 
pot. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the tax angles are a lot trickier, and money-market yields have fallen 
to their lowest levels in a generation. The annual IRA marketing blitz at tax 
time is only a faint echo of what it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will probably be another quiet year for IRAs," says the newsletter 100 
Highest Yields, based in North Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "With interest rates low, bank marketers don't foresee a lot of competition 
for deposits. Thus, the 10% and even 25% bonus rates that once applied to IRAs 
are going to stay a memory." 
</P>
<P>
 But just because the gold-rush mood has dissipated doesn't mean everybody 
should simply ignore the whole subject. Financial advisers say several good 
reasons persist to consider starting, or adding to, IRAs. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the tax laws were changed in 1987, tax deductions for annual IRA 
contributions of up to $2,000 are limited to people who aren't covered by other 
retirement plans at work, and whose income doesn't exceed specified limits. 
</P>
<P>
 For single taxpayers, a full deduction is available with adjusted gross income 
of $25,000 or less; a partial deduction from $25,000 to $35,000, and no 
deduction above that point. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of married couples filing jointly, the full deduction stops at the 
$40,000 income level, with a partial deduction in the $40,000 to $50,000 range 
and nothing at $50,000 and above. 
</P>
<P>
 "Non-deductible contributions do not lower your current year's tax bill, of 
course," says the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen in a current handbook on 
tax strategies. "But they do allow you to take advantage of tax-deferred 
compounding of income until the earnings are withdrawn from the IRA. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the record-keeping created by non-deductible contributions can be 
heavy, they can help create a retirement nest egg." 
</P>
<P>
 Once a saver has determined to make an IRA contribution, the problem remains 
of picking a good place to put the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are the pickings slim on fixed-return vehicles like CDs, but the 
choices are a bit scary in stock and bond investments as well, if you listen to 
the many analysts predicting "corrections" for either or both of those markets. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the typical IRA investment by definition is a long-term commitment. 
Most analysts believe you can confidently hope that stock prices will be 
considerably higher 10 or 20 years from now than they are today, even if you 
are not at all sure that they will rise over the next year or two. 
</P>
<P>
 And yes, there still is some competition for your IRA business, at least among 
discount brokers and mutual fund companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these firms have been reducing or eliminating their annual IRA account 
fees lately, at least for accounts of $5,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Other marketing inducements can still be found. For example, Calvert Group 
Inc., manager of a family of socially conscious mutual funds, is seeking IRA 
accounts by offering to donate $10 of its first year's annual $15 IRA fee to 
one of 22 nonprofit organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline for all IRA contributions, deductible or not, for the 1993 tax 
year is April 15, when most people's income tax returns are due.

AIRLINES TO RAISE FREQUENT FLIER MILEAGE REQUIREMENT; TRAVEL: LED BY UNITED, 
MANY PLAN TO HIKE THE FREE TRIP CONDITIONS FROM 20,000 TO 25,000 MILES TO 
REGAIN MARKETING CONTROL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After three coast-to-coast flights, you might think you have enough frequent 
flier miles for a free ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Get back on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 New rules from some of the biggest airlines mean you'll have to fly more miles 
as a paying passenger to earn the minimum frequent flier award. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by United, big airlines are raising the number of miles to qualify for a 
free domestic ticket, from 20,000 to 25,000. They say it's one way of gaining 
more control over a marketing device that lets so many customers fly free. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest notch in the seemingly never-ending belt-tightening at the nation's 
airlines is risky for them. They don't want to alienate their best customers -- 
the business fliers who pay the priciest fares, fly the most frequently and 
have accrued enormous mileage entitling them to fat awards. 
</P>
<P>
 The most-frequent fliers may not necessarily see the new rules as a sacrifice, 
since they have so many miles accumulated anyway. But many less-frequent 
passengers see the awards as an entitlement. They're angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I resent it. I work hard to earn those miles," said George Brakeley III, a 
fund-raising consultant for nonprofit corporations. "I regard awards from 
frequent flier programs as something due me and they make it tougher and 
tougher and tougher to get the awards." 
</P>
<P>
 For some of the most-frequent fliers, the increase is actually welcome news. 
The higher requirement means there will be fewer people competing for free 
seats on the choicest routes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gotten to be more of a seller's market," said Randy Mohr, who worked on 
developing the Diners Club frequent flier program and is now advertising 
manager for the National Safety Council. "There are more people with miles 
looking for the trips and there are more people looking for seats." 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of passengers, maybe 90%, are not-so-frequent fliers and 
have been just barely qualifying for a free ticket at the 20,000-mile level, 
estimates Randy Petersen, editor and publisher of InsideFlyer, a monthly 
magazine that provides details on frequent flier programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are the travelers, he said, who need to concentrate more on using credit 
cards, hotels, rental car chains and long-distance companies that are part of 
their frequent flier programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting early next year, United, American, USAir and others intend to 
increase the minimum mileage requirement for a free ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental and America West are studying whether to change their programs and 
Northwest Airlines is likely to raise its requirements. TWA, still recovering 
from years of passenger ill-will encountered during its bankruptcy 
reorganization, has decided to leave the minimum reward level at 20,000 miles 
for now. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta Air Lines is one of the few airlines that doesn't impose a deadline on 
when miles can be used, but that generosity might not last. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Delta's frequent flier program say the airline has told them it is 
reviewing the program with an eye toward falling in line with the rest of the 
industry. The airline will only say the program is under review. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason for the airline industry's increased stinginess in frequent 
flier awards is that you don't have to fly to collect the miles. You can drive 
a rental car. You can stay in a hotel. You can charge groceries on your credit 
card. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas-based traveling salesman Bobby Finken scored a substantial number of 
frequent flier miles during a two-month period late last year, but only 13% 
resulted from actually flying. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole system has gotten so out of kilter, they pile the miles on," said 
Finken, who has more than 1 million untapped miles. "I look at it like it's 
money. . . . It's there for the taking." 
</P>
<P>
 But spending those miles on free trips has gotten more difficult. In recent 
years, airlines have limited the number of seats allotted for frequent flier 
freebie tickets on each flight, blacked out some of the most popular travel 
dates and put a three-year limit on how long the miles may remain unused. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, some airlines have cut back on one of the more popular frequent 
flier perks -- the free first-class upgrade -- by reducing the number of 
first-class seats on their jets or eliminating first class altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Airlines say the cost of the free seats has grown excessive. On a flight with 
100 passengers, six on average will be flying free on frequent flier miles. 
That's a 33% increase since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, frequent flier programs have been a powerful selling tool for the 
airlines, tapping an enormous market of people who might otherwise avoid 
flying. Moreover, these programs may not be as much of a financial drain as the 
airlines claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotels, cellular telephone companies and the like that award frequent flier 
miles reimburse airlines for any free trips earned, whether the passenger 
cashes them or not. Not only can the airline realize a windfall from those 
unused mileage points, but it gets a regular check from the other companies. 
How the Flier Programs Took Flight 
</P>
<P>
 Chronology of the airline industry's frequent flier programs: 
</P>
<P>
 1981 -- American Airlines introduces AAdvantage frequent flier program, first 
industry effort to systematically track passengers and give regulars perks for 
repeat business. 
</P>
<P>
 1986 -- Credit card companies strike deals with airlines to offer mileage 
points to consumers based on the amount of money charged each month. 
</P>
<P>
 1987 -- Airlines crack down on mileage point brokers who buy miles from 
frequent fliers and resell them. Some airlines sued brokers and required 
frequent fliers to collect their free tickets in person. United limited 
transfers of mileage awards to the frequent flier's family. 
</P>
<P>
 January, 1988 -- Led by Delta Air Lines, major carriers undertake a wildly 
popular extra-mileage promotion. Airlines offer triple miles for fliers who 
take a trip before a deadline. Later in the year, airlines also start limiting 
the number of seats on each flight available to travelers flying free on 
mileage awards and black out some of the more popular holiday travel dates. 
</P>
<P>
 April, 1988 -- Airlines restrict number of ways frequent flier miles can be 
used, but allow miles to be transferred as gifts to anyone, not just family 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 November, 1993 -- United Airlines discloses plans to raise the minimum number 
of miles to receive a free domestic ticket from 20,000 to 25,000 miles. Other 
requirements are also tightened. Other airlines go along with the changes, 
scheduled to take effect early in 1995.

WHO'S TO BLAME?; FRANCISCO DEL REY, 15, IS CHARGED WITH MANSLAUGHTER IN A MIAMI 
CAR CRASH THAT LEFT THREE YOUNG MEN DEAD AND ANOTHER PARALYZED. RARELY HAS A 
WRECK BEEN MORE STEEPED IN SENSELESS, YOUTHFUL TRAGEDY, SPAWNED MORE NEWS 
COVERAGE OR PROVOKED MORE PUBLIC DEBATE.

 Free-lance news photographer Marc Siegal makes a living by video-taping what 
he calls "grisly scenes with twisted metal and bodies spilling out of cars like 
hamburger." He's seen a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when he arrived shortly after 3 a.m. on Dec. 30 at the intersection of 
17th and South Dixie Highway, Siegal says he did not fully appreciate the 
horror before him. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoke drifted up from the crumpled shell of a black Corvette; inside, two 
people didn't move. A third lay on the pavement nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Some yards away, at the end of a trail of twisted debris, sat two charred 
clumps of metal about armchair size. In one, he could make out two mangled 
bodies. Amid car parts on the street he could make out the disfigured remains 
of yet another. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, says Siegal, 34, "I couldn't tell what had happened. Then I realized 
that these two pieces were the front and back of one car, a Chevette. I assumed 
that the fire department had cut the car in half to get the bodies out." 
</P>
<P>
 No. The Chevette had been cut in half by the Corvette, which witnesses said 
had been drag-racing a high-performance Mustang at speeds estimated at more 
than 100 miles an hour. Three young men in the Chevette were killed instantly 
when their car turned left into the Corvette's path. 
</P>
<P>
 Air bags saved the Corvette's driver and a front-seat passenger from serious 
injury. A third person, riding in the luggage compartment, was thrown from the 
sports car and left a quadriplegic. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hospital later that morning, the father of the Corvette's driver told 
reporters: "He was not to blame. The car turned in front of him. It wasn't my 
son's fault." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 There have been car crashes in Miami involving more carnage, more vehicles, 
even more speed. But rarely has a wreck been more steeped in senseless, 
youthful tragedy, spawned more news coverage and provoked more public debate. 
</P>
<P>
 At the focus of the public anguish is baby-faced high school freshman 
Francisco Del Rey, who apparently was given everything in his young life except 
a set of rules. 
</P>
<P>
 After a night of club-hopping on trendy South Beach with two friends, 
Francisco, 15, was at the wheel of the black 1994 Corvette leased for him by 
his father. Moreover, according to a report in the Miami Herald, Frank Del Rey 
helped his underage son falsify his birth date to illegally obtain a driver's 
license. Police are investigating. 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco is charged with three counts of manslaughter and one of using a 
phony driver's license. Additional charges of homicide by driving under the 
influence of alcohol and marijuana, and manslaughter with a deadly weapon -- 
the Corvette -- have been dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Francisco will be tried as an adult, a judge ruled last week, and if 
convicted on all counts, he could face up to 50 years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Until he was released Friday, Francisco had spent three weeks in juvenile 
detention, where his attorney, Simon T. Steckel, says he had grown depressed 
and suffered the taunts of others in the lock-up, who would go "vroom, vroom" 
when they saw him. "He is being vilified by the public," Steckel says. 
"Everybody is looking to point a finger." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor David I. Gilbert, however, said in court that Francisco's "willful 
conduct" in speeding makes him to blame for "five people's lives unalterably 
changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, dozens of letters to newspapers and hours of talk on radio and in private 
indicate that many in Miami think that it is Francisco's parents who should 
stand trial.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you set out to create an offender, you would probably do the kinds of 
things this family apparently did," says sociologist Paul Cromwell, who has 
used the Del Rey case as a topic of lively discussion in his criminology 
classes at the University of Miami. "He was not given any assistance in growing 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 And while insisting that Francisco must be held responsible for his actions, 
even Juvenile Judge Steve Levine seemed to echo that view last week during a 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is a 15-year-old doing at 3 o'clock in the morning driving a powerful 
'Vette, presumably given to him by his parents with a driver's license they 
helped him obtain?" the judge wondered aloud during a hearing last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This constitutes almost criminal neglect by the parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Levine released Francisco to the custody of his uncle, Julio, Frank Del Rey's 
brother, while warning that he did not want the parents exercising any 
authority over their son until the criminal case has been settled. Then, in an 
aside to Francisco, Levine said: "I know they love you, but I question their 
judgment as I question yours." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Florida has serious problems with juvenile crime. One of the kids charged in 
the highly publicized slaying of a British tourist near Tallahassee last 
September is just 13. The three Miamians accused of murdering a German visitor 
days earlier are all teen-agers. Just last month, a 16-year-old girl in West 
Palm Beach shot a cab driver in the head after she and two friends got a ride 
home from the mall, police say. The apparent motive: She didn't want to pay the 
$6 fare. 
</P>
<P>
 In most of the sensational killings that have made international headlines and 
dismayed Florida's tourism officials, the accused have come from economically 
deprived backgrounds, from families often headed by single parents. The crimes 
have touched off furious debate here about strengthening the family unit, as 
well as how to handle juveniles charged with heinous crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Florida Legislature reconvened earlier this month, crime, the family 
and the construction of more prisons for young offenders were high on the 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Del Rey's family is intact. He lived with his father, mother and 
older siblings in a house valued at $1.5 million. He attended a private school, 
where he wore a beeper and carried his own cellular phone. He totaled his first 
Corvette -- a yellow $40,000 1993 model -- last summer when he was in eighth 
grade. His father replaced it with the 1994 model. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, many think Francisco was deprived, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a situation where the Del Rey family comes into the community, with a 
lot of dollars to throw around, leading an arrogant lifestyle," says Stewart G. 
Greenberg, an attorney who has filed a $20-million civil suit against the Del 
Reys on behalf of Carlos Brito, 16, the passenger thrown from the Corvette and 
now paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Siegal, the photographer: "I'm just furious at the parents. What was his 
option? To renounce his parents, his lifestyle, his phony driver's license? 
Give me a break. He's a victim, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Comments from Del Rey's relatives and friends seem only to have inflamed 
public opinion. His girlfriend's mother was quoted as saying that the three men 
who died in the Chevette were being portrayed as "bigger than life just because 
they're poor and Eagle Scouts." She said the Del Reys were getting "a bad rap . 
. . just because they have money and can afford giving him a Corvette."  
</P>
<P>
 After Del Rey was formally charged and led off to the juvenile lockup last 
month, his stepsister wailed: "He's just a baby! He's not to blame." 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, the Miami Herald weighed in with an editorial: "The Del Reys 
just don't get it, and their young son and brother, Francisco, has become the 
lightning rod through which a community's disgust and ire sear the entire 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco's parents, Frank and Gloria, moved to Miami in the late 1970s from 
Puerto Rico, where she was a beauty queen and he had a long history of troubled 
business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Miami Herald, Frank Del Rey, 48, and his brother, Julio, were 
embroiled in a mid-1970s scandal involving missing building permits for a motel 
they operated. Payoffs were alleged, and when a bomb turned up under the car of 
a rival motel owner, it blew off the hands of two bomb-squad members who tried 
to defuse it. The Del Reys were suspects, according to reports, but no one was 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
 In Miami, Frank Del Rey bought a onetime resort near the Everglades, and local 
Drug Enforcement Administration officers were on the scene in 1979, 
investigating reports it had become a landing zone for drug smugglers, 
according to the Miami Herald. And, in 1985, he was detained in Colombia for 
violating its air space. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, meanwhile, were frequently called to the Del Reys' sprawling 
six-bedroom house, protected by Rottweilers and a super-sensitive alarm system. 
Some calls were in response to burglaries; one time a housesitter attempted 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 By the late 1980s, Frank Del Rey reportedly was running a lucrative business 
shipping luxury cars to Puerto Rico. But in 1991, a federal grand jury in 
Puerto Rico said the cars were hot, and Del Rey was indicted on charges of 
unlawful interstate commerce. A plea bargain resulted in a year's probation and 
$1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Herald, the Del Reys also had tax problems; the couple failed 
to file income tax returns from 1982 to 1985, a court said. 
</P>
<P>
 And in 1989, the Herald reported, Del Rey's stepdaughter accused him of trying 
to rape her in her San Juan apartment. The charges were later withdrawn at her 
mother's request. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Steckel calls most of the allegations "media fodder" unrelated to 
Francisco's case, but he refuses comment on family history or Frank Del Rey's 
occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, other Miami Herald revelations have further complicated the Del 
Reys' image problems. Frank Del Ray is said to have pressured a priest in 
Puerto Rico to alter a birth date on a baptismal record so Francisco could get 
a driver's license. And Francisco's mother and stepsister reportedly were 
arrested in 1986 for grand theft after being stopped in a stolen car. The file 
in the latter case has been sealed by the court. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Del Rey has a steel rod in his leg from his first serious accident, 
when he smashed up a motorcycle at 13 while living in Venezuela. In Miami, he 
had racked up at least four traffic violations. The family has no health 
insurance, and the county's public hospital says it may be out about $16,000 
for treating Francisco after the two Corvette crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 The firestorm of publicity has wiped out any chance he had to get a fair trial 
here, Steckel charges: "This case has become larger than life, and 99% of 
what's been reported . . . has nothing to do with the case. Every family must 
have things in the closet; it's still totally irrelevant." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Francisco had been drinking and has been charged with manslaughter, 
he was not legally drunk, according to blood tests. But the driver of the 
Chevette was. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Jerez, 21, a shoe salesman, had a blood-alcohol level of .14%, above the 
1993 limit of .10, when he pulled out to make a left turn, according to 
reports. He and his passengers, Eagle Scout Alvaro Cadenas, 19, and Carlos 
Rios, 18, roommates at the University of Florida, had been partying in the 
Coconut Grove section of Miami before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Steckel claims that the speed of the Corvette is not a factor: "The undisputed 
fact is that the Chevette failed to yield the right of way. I don't know how 
you get around that. The speed issue is irrelevant." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant State Atty. Gilbert will counter that a driver turning left must 
only make sure that the intersection is clear and is not required to anticipate 
a distant, oncoming car doing 100 miles an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Panter, an attorney representing Luis Jerez's family, says the 
blood-alcohol finding of the Chevette's driver "is irrelevant because of the 
speed of the Corvette. It was like a torpedo. Anyone would have pulled out 
(into the intersection)." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, a judge or jury may assign blame. But assessing true guilt may be 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cromwell's sociology class, several students expressed the anger they felt 
when they read about the crash, and their horror in picturing the deaths and 
injuries of so many people their own age. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no sense that they wanted to burn this kid," Cromwell says. "The 
consensus in class has been that there are contributory aspects here, that 
although Francisco should be responsible for his behavior, the parents 
contributed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was angry myself when I first heard family members say, 'It's not his 
fault; he's just a baby.' But then I thought, they're probably right."

'THIS TOO SHALL PASS'; SISTER MARIE MADELEINE SHONKA, CHIEF OF ST. JOHN'S, 
LOOKS AT THE CENTER'S FUTURE AND AT LIFE AFTER THE QUAKE -- WHEN SHE LOST HER 
JOB, HOSPITAL, HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Sister Marie Madeleine Shonka, president and chief executive officer of St. 
John's Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica, is taking stock these days 
after the Northridge quake closed St. John's. Gone are her hospital and its 
1,750 employees, gone are her home and her roommates. 
</P>
<P>
 The 67-year-old Sister of Charity, a dead ringer for the woman on the See's 
candy box, now lives in a 2BD, 2BA apartment with her closest friend and senior 
assistant, Sister Alice Marie Schwieder. Sitting in their new environs with 
Frank Sinatra crooning "Fly Me to the Moon" over the radio, Shonka talked about 
the tasks ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What will happen to St. John's Hospital? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: St. John's will never be the same. It will be different. It will be 
better. The most dramatic thing will be razing the North Wing. This is an 
opportunity to prepare ourselves for the health care of the next century. We've 
known all along that there is an excess of hospital beds in Southern California 
and that we did not need 501 beds.  
</P>
<P>
 When we reopen the South Wing in August, we'll have about 150 inpatient beds. 
The volume of inpatients has decreased significantly and the volume of 
outpatients has increased. We are going to work with Santa Monica Hospital so 
that both of us are meeting unmet community needs. Maybe we'll develop a 
medical-mall type of approach, where you have multiple, walk-in clinics with 
dentistry, inpatient beds, emergency activities and free-standing surgery 
centers.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think most health-care facilities are moving in that general 
direction? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Outpatient is less costly and a more effective way of meeting public needs. 
When I first came here in 1968, about 10% of our surgery was outpatient. A 
patient would come in the morning, have surgery and go home at night. The rest 
of the surgeries, patients would stay five or 10 days. With the changes in 
health-care delivery, we are now finding that about 60% of our surgery is done 
in an outpatient capacity. We need to accommodate much fewer inpatients.  
</P>
<P>
 Other hospitals will be in the same situation in the future, where they will 
have to look at programs and services directed at the health-care revolution.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is motivating the movement toward outpatient care? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Doctors prefer it because it gives them a broader turnover of patients. 
It's more cost-effective. Many patients prefer it. Maybe the future patient is 
a working man who can't give up a weekday to come in for surgery. Maybe there 
are options for him to come in on Friday, recuperate over the weekend and get 
back out on the job on Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 I think, with the Clinton health plan, or whatever version comes out of it, 
that people will stay healthier as we move into preventive medicine and we 
won't be looking at long-term stays. We're a much healthier country now. Most 
people that came here in 1968 would come for maybe two or three days to get 
annual physicals.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is your view on Clinton's health-care plan as it stands now? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The goals, access and universal coverage are really very important. The 
challenges will be in looking at how we can accommodate access and still have 
reimbursement that is projected to be much less.  
</P>
<P>
 I am concerned about these alliances (a concept of managed competition where 
regional alliances representing consumers would shop among competing insurance 
plans for the best deals and deliver report cards to health plans, hospitals 
and doctors) they are talking about. I am concerned that it could become a 
bureaucratic maze.  
</P>
<P>
 Price-fixing would be a very serious problem. It has not ever worked in any of 
our major industries. If everything were price-fixed that would be fine, but if 
a hospital is price-fixed in what it can charge, but the people outside and 
vendors are not, then it could inundate a hospital with red ink in a short 
period of time.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How are you dealing with all these losses since the earthquake, including 
the severance of all these employees who considered St. John's a family? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I get emotional when I talk to my employees and say goodby after all those 
years. I have cried. And it really kind of tears you apart after awhile. But in 
all fairness to them, you really have to sever relationships so they can find 
jobs because it is just never going to be the same.  
</P>
<P>
 But the loss of the sisters is one of the most poignant things for me. It's 
lonesome. I always enjoyed seeing them at meals, and I miss that. It's like 
disrupting a family -- it kind of gets convulsed and it's going to get more 
convulsed in the next few months. But this too shall pass.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Some former St. John's employees have said that they feel betrayed because 
they say they were told that they would not get priority over other applicants 
for jobs when the facility reopens and because, initially, they were told that 
they would not retain seniority if rehired. 
</P>
<P>
 A: We made a mistake with the seniority. But we heard the employees' 
complaints and we made the adjustments. Now if an employee had 15 years' 
seniority and they were gone for (up to five years) they could still come back 
in at the 15-year level.  
</P>
<P>
 Some of this is a misunderstanding or confusion or anger at things in general 
and at life in particular. We have spent a lot of time, effort and energy to 
develop a cadre of employees that really represent St. John's. Why would I, at 
this point in time, go out and bring in total strangers to go about our 
mission, our ministry and our work efforts?  
</P>
<P>
 We felt so compelled to give good severance packages because we know that 
nobody could be down from February to August, particularly when there are going 
to be 1,000 less jobs now.  
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see what the devil has happened here 
with the hospital down. I really feel badly that so many were laid off. But I 
didn't create the earthquake. I just didn't do it.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What has it been like living in an apartment after having spent 45 years in 
a convent with a community of religious sisters? You have a Betty Crocker 
cookbook on the coffee table. What kind of cuisine is served up at night? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The food was brought up from the cafeteria every day (when the convent was 
on the hospital's sixth floor) , so cooking, baking and shopping are things we 
have to deal with. I am abhorrent of shopping, for clothes or anything. And I 
just don't cook. I cooked our first meal here and Sister Alice Marie was sick 
the next day. We decided to let her cook the meals. All I did was scramble eggs 
and bacon. I am hoping she got an illness from something else.  
</P>
<P>
 But it has been different, challenging and lonesome. I lost my job, my 
hospital and my home all in one day. This is where we live now. It's a nice, 
cute lovely apartment, but for me, the loss of the sisters was the most 
traumatic thing.  
</P>
<P>
 I used to always have a Super Bowl party. I watched it in my new apartment, 
and there were only two of us to have my usual party with the chips, dips, 
popcorn and beer. My heart was with Buffalo, but my money was on Dallas.  
</P>
<P>
 I am a great, great sports fan. I've always been like that. I was the only 
girl on the block in a little town of Chapel in western Nebraska and whatever 
the boys were playing, either football or basketball, they let me play because 
they knew it was OK for the guys to push me around and tackle me. And women, at 
that time, weren't the highest priority in Chapel and still aren't. But I have 
had a happy career as a sportsperson.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Where do you think nuns are today in terms of the public perception, from 
the 1966 movie "The Singing Nun" to today's "Sister Act 2," and in the 
patriarchal power structure of the church? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I enjoyed "Sister Act," just the fun of it. I haven't seen the second one, 
but nuns are real live human beings and we like to laugh, work and pray. We are 
products of our age. We are no longer isolated in a convent. Some dress in 
habit, some don't. We have far more exposure to all the issues that people 
face. Although we don't face the same issues, simpatico and compassionately, we 
can really identify with their problems.  
</P>
<P>
 The power structure of the church is still predominantly male, but I think 
that the future of the church is recognized in the contribution of the many 
marvelous women who are committed as deeply as cardinals, bishops and priests 
to our faith and service.  
</P>
<P>
 And I've met people who simply don't like nuns. They can be very rude. I 
always laugh and say, "I'll bet somebody rapped their knuckles with a ruler 
when they were in grade school." You just have to try and develop an individual 
relationship with them.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think sisters will ever say Mass, become priests or bishops? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Heard a joke about that one: The Pope was very ill. One night, he went to 
sleep and woke up thinking he saw the heavenly Father there and he said, "Oh, 
heavenly Father, do you think there will ever be married priests in the 
church?" And the heavenly Father said, "No, not in your lifetime."  
</P>
<P>
 The next night he had another vision, and he said, "Oh, heavenly Father, do 
you think nuns will ever say Mass in the church?" And He said, "No, not in your 
lifetime."  
</P>
<P>
 And the next night, he had another vision and he said to the heavenly Father, 
"Do you think that there will ever be another Polish pope in the church?" And 
He said, "No, not in my lifetime."  
</P>
<P>
 I love that joke.  
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest task of Sister Marie Madeleine Shonka's 26-year career at St. 
John's Hospital and Medical Center will be planning a St. John's for the 21st 
Century. Although the 52-year-old hospital now has outpatient services, 
inpatient won't be available until August and the immediate future calls for 
demolition of the North Wing, home to the nursery, obstetric beds, a 
chemical-dependency unit, surgical-medical beds, a neonatal-intensive-care unit 
and a transitional-care unit. Shonka -- unbending as leader of the prominent 
hospital where she has collected 18 humanitarian awards and earned such 
endearments as "the angel of St. John's" and health-care visionary -- is 
dealing with the loss of 10 of her fellow Sisters of Charity. After the quake, 
they were called home to Leavenworth, Kan., and reassigned. Her new apartment 
in Santa Monica, a far cry from the convent at the hospital, marks the first 
time in 45 years that she has lived outside an institution.

HE IS GRETZKY'S SILENT PARTNER; KING DEFENSEMAN KURRI QUIETLY HAS RISEN TO 10TH 
IN CAREER GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Waiting for Wayne Gretzky has turned into a full-time job when the Kings' 
traveling road show journeys through NHL arenas in the United States and 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Jari Kurri took a peek into the locker room at the crush of notepads 
and mini-cams and decided to make an entrance, playing Gretzky for a moment. 
Kurri opened the door and sort of hopped in, as if to say, "Well, here I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Kurri stood there only long enough to sense the split-second disappointment, 
smiled and then laughed to himself and closed the door. He knew the media were 
not waiting for him, which is exactly the way Kurri wants it. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, that isn't entirely true all the time. When a cadre of Finnish 
journalists show up in some outpost -- "The guys with the funny hair," Coach 
Barry Melrose calls them -- Kurri knows they are around to ask one of two 
things: 
</P>
<P>
 -- How is Wayne Gretzky? 
</P>
<P>
 -- What is going on with Teemu Selanne? 
</P>
<P>
 His closeness to Gretzky and Selanne often means that Kurri's accomplishments 
don't always receive proper appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky's race toward Gordie Howe's record of 801 goals has been widely 
chronicled. There will soon be a growing entourage, and when Gretzky finally 
breaks it, King owner Bruce McNall will probably give him something befitting 
the occasion, like, say, a shiny Rolls-Royce. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurri, meanwhile, took sole possession of the 10th spot among the all-time NHL 
goal scorers with his 545th on Feb. 2, surpassing Maurice (Rocket) Richard. He 
already had passed Stan Mikita, Frank Mahovlich and Michel Goulet. Now he needs 
six goals to tie John Bucyk in ninth place at 556. 
</P>
<P>
 But after Kurri moved past Richard, there was no celebration, especially since 
the struggling Kings lost that game in Edmonton. The historic moment was almost 
forgotten amid the futility. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just (beating) one guy," Kurri said. "It's to be up there in that 
group of guys that feels good. That means something. . . . If it weren't for 
(Gretzky), I wouldn't be anywhere near these numbers. He's been the biggest 
part of my success." 
</P>
<P>
 In perhaps the twilight of his NHL career, the 33-year-old Kurri has been 
playing his stellar yet reliable brand of two-way hockey. Once, Gretzky and 
Kurri led the Oilers to Stanley Cups. Now, they're trying to keep the Kings 
from slipping into the abyss, out of playoff contention. Kurri, who has 26 
goals and 63 points this season, is on the power play, kills penalties with 
Gretzky and takes almost every critical faceoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine where the Kings would be if Gretzky and Kurri weren't playing well. 
Gretzky always has had an acute sense of Kurri's presence and vice versa, but 
the two players have been reading each other's patterns with uncanny accuracy 
lately. 
</P>
<P>
 Melrose was asked whether Gretzky and Kurri can read one another's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like a Star Trek episode," Melrose said. "There was one episode 
where Jim and Spock shared the same brain and Jim had to lead Spock around." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Kurri and Gretzky seem to take turns leading the way on the ice. 
They haven't changed, and remain quick to give one another credit. "He's been 
the best two-way player in the game," Gretzky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky's words have been echoed by Melrose, who has been conducting a 
campaign for Kurri, nominating him for the Selke Trophy, given to the league's 
top defensive forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of it is a players' reputation," Melrose said. "(Bob) Gainey and (Doug) 
Jarvis won it all those years. And (Guy) Carbonneau. Jari had 87 points last 
year and played against every top center. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Sergei) Fedorov is a lot like Jari -- maybe he's the closest thing to Jari. 
He plays a defensive centerman's role." 
</P>
<P>
 All this, of course, doesn't mean Melrose really understands Kurri. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a funny man," Melrose said, "the way he carries himself. He's a genius 
on the ice. He forces men to make mistakes. He and Gretz go good together 
because they out-think the opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jari doesn't talk to anybody. He doesn't even talk to Gretz." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not as though Kurri is mute. He speaks. But not in meetings. "I 
shouldn't talk to the coach," Kurri said. "I talk if I have something to say." 
</P>
<P>
 He has something to say about his tennis matches in Finland against Selanne 
last summer. Kurri is a tenacious baseliner, no surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think very early in the season, he was winning," Kurri said. "By the end of 
the summer, I'm catching up. He goes on holidays earlier and I played (hockey) 
until June." 
</P>
<P>
 Kurri smiled. No doubt Selanne was reminded several times about Winnipeg's 
early playoff exit, which gave him more time to practice his backhand. Kurri 
and Selanne often talk after King-Jet games. With both teams struggling, they 
haven't had pleasant things to discuss. 
</P>
<P>
 Selanne is rehabilitating his injured leg, and Kurri called him the day after 
he had surgery. Kurri, who lives in Calabasas, has had natural disasters to 
talk about. The October fires came very close to his home, and the family 
loaded up the car, poised to evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on Jan. 17 in Philadelphia, Kurri answered the phone, and it was his 
wife, Tiina. Tiina and his 8-year-old twin sons, Joonas and Ville, never had to 
deal with earthquakes in Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was crying," Kurri said. "They were all crying. One of the kids (Joonas) 
was trapped in his bedroom, the door was shut closed. He got it open. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now he is sleeping in our room." 
</P>
<P>
 The family -- like everyone else in the San Fernando Valley -- grew jittery 
during the aftershocks. Kurri poked a little fun at himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the summer (of 1991), I came here to sign my contract," Kurri said. "We 
were in a hotel. Our first day in L.A., there was an earthquake. I said, 'Don't 
worry. Only one every 10 years.' " 
</P>
<P>
 No punch line was necessary. Kurri simply shook his head. Life in Finland is 
looking quite inviting these days. "After this year, I have to make a big 
decision," Kurri said. "I have my option year (next season). If I play my 
option out, I won't play any more." 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing to prove. Kurri has helped to win five Stanley Cups and is the 
highest-scoring European player in NHL history. As for judging his career, 
consider the company he has kept: Gretzky, Mark Messier, Paul Coffey and Luc 
Robitaille, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 To punctuate it all, he belongs to an exclusive hockey club where everyone is 
on a first-name basis -- Gordie, Wayne, Guy -- and he's already paid his dues 
in goals.

MIKE DOWNEY: LILLEHAMMER / '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; RAGING BELLES PUTTING THIS 
FIGHT ON ICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like any good fight, the Thrilla at Lillehammer will begin tonight with the 
introductions. In this corner, wearing the . . . what? Gossamer white? Weighing 
in at 115 pounds in her stocking feet and kneecap Band-Aid, the mademoiselle 
from Massachusetts, that courageous "Why Me?" lady, NANNNN-cy KERRRR-igan! And, 
in this corner, at a spunky 105 1/4 pounds, wearing a tulip-pattern teddy from 
Frederick's of Amsterdam, that ornery Oregonian, that mistress of mischief, 
TONNNN-ya HARRRR-ding! 
</P>
<P>
 OK, let's have a good, clean skate. No gouging, no mugging, no ponytail 
pulling, no sequin plucking. In case of a knockdown, go to your nearest 
"kiss-and-cry" area. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, shake hands and come out skating. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the rouge will be flowing, ladies and gentlemen. In tonight's main event 
at the world-famous--well, maybe not--Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre, we will 
finally get to see the head-to-toe combat between Nancy Kerrigan, a woman once 
voted to People magazine's "50 Most Beautiful People in America," and Tonya 
Harding, a woman recently nominated for the FBI's "10 Most Wanted" list. 
</P>
<P>
 What a night, what a fight. These top-ranked contenders from this month's 
issue of Rink magazine will be pirouetting, pouting and putting everything they 
have into Round 1 of a maximum two-rounder that could turn out to be a 
super-colossal, trans-global, why-are-we-watching-this-nonsense flopperoo or 
else the most hair-raising experience since Don King. (And remember, the 
smaller they are, the faster they fall.) 
</P>
<P>
 Let's get ready to rummmmmmmble!  
</P>
<P>
 Back in America, CBS is expecting ratings somewhere between Hawkeye Pierce 
giving a farewell kiss to Hot Lips Houlihan and descendants of Kunte Kinte 
searching for their African roots. All this for a couple of semi-obscure 
figures of figure skating who at least temporarily have surpassed Peggy 
Fleming, Dorothy Hamill, Kristi Yamaguchi and Hans Brinker in the 
slippery-footing hall of fame, without either having ever won an Olympic gold 
medal--or silver, even. 
</P>
<P>
 During 6 1/2 weeks of crime drama, soap opera and situation-comedy that have 
kept many TV viewers enthralled since Kerrigan was ambushed by alleged 
acquaintances of Harding's, what was once a gentle, almost dainty athletic 
event has been transformed into a three-rink circus. 
</P>
<P>
 Among hundreds of gags told by every stand-up comic who can stand up, there 
was David Letterman's line: "CBS had so much success with last week's special, 
'Nancy Kerrigan & Friends,' they're coming back next week with another special, 
'Tonya Harding & Accomplices.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, what a wacky story. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan, the victim, practically went into hiding. There was constant 
surveillance of Harding's every step, every sound, every purchase of a Slurpie 
at a 7-Eleven. Tonya's truck gets a parking ticket! (Film at 11. ) Her asthma 
made her cough. Her friend had a fender-bender. Her lawyer filed a lawsuit. Her 
fans gave her a teddy bear. Her neighbor asked her to baby-sit. Her mommy 
fainted on a talk show. Her ex exposed her chest to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 And, say what you will about media madness, two letters to the editor 
typifying the outrageousness of the general public's reaction to the 
Kerrigan-Harding case recently ran back-to-back on the op-ed page of an Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution newspaper--one in reply to an editorial cartoon, the other 
in reply to a columnist who specializes in country slang. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Luckovich's cartoon showing Charles Manson being allowed to skate in the 
Olympics was possibly the most tasteless effort in recent times. --Frank O. 
Walsh III, Atlanta 
</P>
<P>
 As a lover and admirer of good ol' girls, I get turned on by Tonya's trash 
talkin', truck drivin', illegal parkin', consortin' with shady characters and 
inhalant suckin'. --Jim Simpson, Atlanta 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No morsel has been too small, no quote too insipid. We've read detailed 
accounts of Kerrigan waving and saying, "Bye." We've heard sound bites of 
Harding saying, "Thanks for coming." We have probed for comments from 
luminaries ranging from President Clinton to King Harald V of Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 We have seen Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings and Dan Rather discuss latest news 
updates in the Nancy-Tonya story, then move along to developments in Bosnia. We 
have seen Connie Chung attach herself to this story as snugly as spandex to a 
speedskater, accompany Tonya even on the overseas flight, then suddenly 
alienate Tonya with a question tougher than any Connie apparently had asked her 
on the plane, including, possibly, "Are you going to eat those peanuts?" 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, the show goes on. In what has become the nastiest rivalry between two 
women in the world, with the possible exceptions of Glenn Close and Patti 
LuPone, the skaters representing America in the XVII Winter Olympics will strut 
their stuff--Kerrigan and Harding, alias Nancy and Sluggo. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see, Kerrigan's costume will be created by the famous designer Vera 
Wang, possibly not her trademark white this time, but probably with her 
customary frilly lace. Harding's costume is being shipped here overnight, a new 
one designed to make her look more attractive and get her off Mister 
Blackwell's Worst-Dressed list. Clothes count in this sport. It's like boxing, 
only tonight they take the gloves off. Kerrigan:

LILLEHAMMER / '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; ANALYSIS; U.S. SKIERS LEFT THEIR CRITICS 
STUCK IN STARTING GATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mistake some critics made in snowplowing the U.S. Alpine skiing program 
before the Olympics -- more salt for that Norwegian crow? -- was letting the 
facts get in the way of a good story. 
</P>
<P>
 They pored over stat sheets and computer rankings and came to the logical 
conclusion that U.S. medal chances in Norway were bleak. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hilary Lindh won the last downhill before the Olympics, at Sierra Nevada, 
Spain, it brought to six the total of World Cup victories by current U.S. 
skiers. Julie Parisien had half of those, and she was starting the Olympics 
mired in a slump. 
</P>
<P>
 AJ Kitt had claimed the only men's victory, but he, too, was struggling. And 
you had to go back to 1985 for Diann Roffe-Steinrotter's last World Cup 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 There had also been upheaval at U.S. ski team headquarters. Dennis Agee 
resigned as Alpine director last spring because of budget cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Peterson, U.S. Skiing's oft-criticized CEO, was stepping aside to make 
way for Mike Jacki. The Alpine development program was in need of an overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
 It was with this ammunition that Sports Illustrated blasted the Alpine team in 
its Olympic preview with the word, woeful.  
</P>
<P>
 Those were the reasons Ski Racing, the international ski journal, called the 
team "pathetic" and "an embarrassment." 
</P>
<P>
 Overlooked, however, were the big-event history of the United States and some 
cornball intangibles, such as Olympic spirit and momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning four Olympic medals in the first week of Alpine events -- two 
gold and two silver -- U.S. coaches have reason to gloat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the reality is, we always believed in ourselves," said Paul Major, 
the U.S. Alpine director. "We believed in the program. The only person you have 
to answer to is yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this on-the-bandwagon, off-the-bandwagon stuff is a pretty sad thing. 
The really sad thing is that the people who really should know, Sports 
Illustrated and Ski Racing, should understand the sport a little better. They 
showed their true colors, and didn't have a clue." 
</P>
<P>
 To suggest the United States had no medal chances was certainly off the mark. 
Although the U.S. team lacked depth, it had half a dozen or so skiers within 
striking distance. 
</P>
<P>
 True, Tommy Moe had never before won an international race, but he had 
finished third in two World Cup races this season and ranked in the top 10 in 
downhill and super-G.  
</P>
<P>
 True, Picabo Street had never stood atop a World Cup podium, but she had won 
the combined silver at last year's World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 True, Roffe-Steinrotter had not won an international race in nine years, yet 
she was the defending Olympic silver medalist in giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
 Ski team critics ignored the team's history as one-hit wonders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alpine team earned three medals at last year's World championships -- two 
silvers and a bronze, and two silvers at the 1992 Albertville Olympics. Other 
U.S. success-story theories: HOW DO YOU FACTOR MOMENTUM? 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Johnson's dramatic downhill victory at the 1984 Sarajevo Games fueled a 
five-medal fire, the best performance by the United States in Olympic Alpine. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years later, Tommy Moe lit an emotional fuse here with his dramatic 
downhill victory in the first Alpine event. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Tommy won the gold, I was so fired up," Picabo Street said. "I couldn't 
sit still. If he could do it, I could do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, Roffe-Steinrotter scored her stunning victory in women's 
super-G. The next day, Moe scored again with his super-G silver. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, last Saturday, the antsy Street struck silver in the women's downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 Europeans watched with envy. Some suspected a conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 At Kvitfjell, site of the speed races, U.S. skiers lodged in a house near the 
top of the course. One veteran World Cup observer wondered why U.S. skiers 
seemed to be making up time on the stretch of snow in front of their cabin, now 
called Medal House. 
</P>
<P>
 This would be known as the second-skier man theory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's just shaking their heads," Major said. "They think we're on fire. 
Once you get that kind of momentum, everyone else is more or less scared of 
you. But they also know there's no miracles, they'll figure that out." 
AMERICANS HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE 
</P>
<P>
 This is a popular theory, usually espoused by Europeans, who face so much 
scrutiny in their countries, they tend to tense up, allowing Americans to 
shine. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know the others will be under pressure, so this helps them to lift up 
their level," Patrick Lang, longtime World Cup chronicler, said of the U.S. 
medal rush. 
</P>
<P>
 Lang suggested that European skiers put so much emphasis on the World Cup 
circuit they don't enter the Olympics with the same spark. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the Europeans are more conservative," Lang said. "I wouldn't say 
boring, but (skiing) is more routine. It's an everyday job. For America, the 
Olympics are a big thing. It's a mental attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Monique Pelletier, a U.S. slalom specialist, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Olympics is the ultimate for Americans," she said. "As a skier, if I won 
a World Cup, I'd be equally happy, but back home, the gold medal goes a long 
way. That's what people notice." VEN PLAYING FIELD 
</P>
<P>
 About 75% of the World Cup tour is raced in Europe. While many Europeans get 
to return home each week, Americans spend months at a time overseas, living out 
of duffel bags. Thus, the Americans are much more comfortable in the Olympic 
village. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a pretty tough group of people," said Pelletier, from Hood River, Ore. 
"We spend weeks on the road, traveling. It makes us more adaptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Euros figure to make up ground in this week's slalom events. 
Although Kyle Rasmussen and Moe finished 2-3 in last week's combined downhill, 
they probably will go the way of Street, who finished second in the women's 
combined downhill, but ended up 10th overall. 
</P>
<P>
 A men's medal in slalom and giant slalom would take a miracle, but the women's 
gate team appears to have a puncher's chance, with Heidi Voelker and Eva 
Twardokens in GS. Parisien has the talent to score in Sunday's slalom, but her 
emotional state is fragile. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the U.S. does not win another medal, what has already been 
accomplished will not be diminished. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-range problems of the U.S. Skiing don't disappear because of four 
medals, yet it was difficult to argue with Moe when he said last week that the 
U.S. team did not deserved to be ridiculed. 
</P>
<P>
 The apology was already on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 A week after SI's critique of the ski team, which described Moe as "no soaring 
success story," Moe graced the magazine's cover and was proclaimed "Golden 
Boy." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson, who two weeks ago had one foot in the cooker and the other out the 
door, walks away vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I'll frame last week's (cover) and this week's together," Peterson 
said. "I know who my friends are. The people who were my friends two weeks ago 
are my friends. I certainly know who my enemies are."

FIRE WITHOUT FLASH; THE ANGELS' BILL BAVASI IS INTENSE ABOUT HIS JOB, BUT GETS 
IT DONE WITHOUT THE FLAIR OF HIS FATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His father used to savor these moments, cherishing every detail. He had news 
conferences mastered: Strut to the lectern, smile for the cameras and drop the 
bombshell that would captivate the town for days. 
</P>
<P>
 Buzzie Bavasi would have been in his glory one afternoon about three weeks 
ago, standing in front of a packed house and announcing that Bo Jackson was 
coming to the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 He wouldn't have left the room until the last reporter had departed, making 
sure every notebook was filled. Bavasi was the only general manager in baseball 
who could have 10 reporters drop in on him during a game and have each of them 
leave believing he or she had a scoop. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent 33 years as general manager of the Dodgers, San Diego Padres and 
Angels and never ducked a pen or a tape recorder in his life. 
</P>
<P>
 But he would have recoiled in horror if he had been around to see the Bo 
Jackson news conference. There was his son sitting on the dais during the 
entire session without saying a word. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bavasi, 36, hired a month ago as Angel general manager, was given an 
excellent opportunity to share the spotlight. Instead, he sat silent, dutifully 
answered a few questions afterward and then slipped quietly to his office. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Bavasi, who now uses the same office his dad once occupied, was 
asked how it feels knowing that he's the man responsible for bringing Jackson 
back to the Southland, this time to play baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," Bavasi said. "I was just hoping I wasn't remembered as the man 
who lost Steve Frey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come on, this isn't like General Patton taking over the troops. This is Bill 
Bavasi scrambling." 
</P>
<P>
 He is the third family member to be a major league general manager, but you 
would never know he was even a distant cousin by his personality. 
</P>
<P>
 Humble and unassuming, Bavasi believes that he is no more important to the 
Angels than his secretaries. He demands input from his employees, refusing to 
make a decision without them. 
</P>
<P>
 There are clubhouse attendants who have bigger egos than Bavasi. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you didn't know any better," said Whitey Herzog, former Angel general 
manager, "you'd never know he was a Bavasi. He's very, very modest, and that's 
not a Bavasi trait. 
</P>
<P>
 "But believe me, this guy is going to be every bit as good as his dad and 
brother, and probably better. He may not toot his own horn, but there are going 
to be people tooting it for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'll be right there at the front of the line." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1981, when Bill Bavasi joined the Angels, I was afraid that one day he 
would become general manager. Now, every Angel fan's worst nightmare has come 
true -- another Bavasi running the team. We can expect more bad trades, seeing 
the best players leave as free agents, and no strategy or commitment to putting 
a winning team on the field."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Letter to The Times, Jan. 22 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Life as a Bavasi was never easy. 
</P>
<P>
 He was supposed to be a better baseball player than his friends . . . because 
of his father. 
</P>
<P>
 He had friends in school who wanted to get close to him . . . because of his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
 He listened to critics tell him that he was handed a job in baseball . . . 
because of his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pretended it wasn't out there," Bavasi said, "but I knew it was. Growing up 
around baseball, you learn to roll with the punches. That's what I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi, who became used to seeing Don Drysdale or Sandy Koufax drop by the 
house on Sunday evenings, made a habit of never volunteering his family 
background. He quit playing baseball in high school, then attended the 
University of San Diego, majoring in psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I didn't associate the name with Bill," said Steve Wesierski, his 
college roommate and best man. "He didn't walk or talk the part of being a 
high-profile guy. I mean, you really had to push. Most people who went to the 
University of San Diego probably never knew who his father was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never felt that he was better than everyone, but it seemed like he already 
had life mapped out. I think he always knew that one day he'd be a (baseball) 
general manager." 
</P>
<P>
 If Bavasi knew how he'd spend the rest of his life, he wasn't dropping any 
hints. The only preferential treatment he received for being Buzzie Bavasi's 
kid was that he got a job on the grounds crew at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
Even after graduation, he worked first as a glorified secretary in the scouting 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being the son of a general manager can help, but also be a big hindrance," 
said Padre General Manager Randy Smith, the son of Tal Smith. "You feel 
sometimes that you have to be twice as good as anybody else to overcome your 
last name. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like you have to prove yourself all the time so that people don't think 
you just got something handed to you. Billy and I can relate to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Whispers of nepotism stopped the moment people met him. He was like everyone 
else. He was promoted to Angel farm director in 1984, and so little was made of 
his background that many players had no idea he was related to Buzzie. Former 
Angel infielder Bobby Grich remembers the time he walked into Bill's office, 
started to grumble about Buzzie and was horrified to learn he was talking to 
his son. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years were spent in the same job, but Bavasi never minded as he tried to 
become the best farm director in baseball. He watched several members of his 
generation being promoted to general managers' jobs, but remained unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom used to get on me," Bavasi said. "She used to tell me, 'Go to the 
All-Star game. Go to the World Series. Go where people will see you there.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I refused. I wasn't going to play politics just to get noticed. It was very 
evident there were some guys, who became farm directors or scouting directors, 
(who) were going places just to be seen in all of the right places. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never did anything to get noticed in my life, and I'm proud of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi's demeanor was so unpretentious that the first day rumors circulated he 
would become general manager of the Angels, he immediately went in and 
apologized to Dan O'Brien and Herzog. He didn't want to take anyone's job, and 
as far as he was concerned, he would stay put until everyone was good and ready 
to retire. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my brother," said Peter, 51, his eldest sibling. "His ego quotient is 
very low. It's hardly even a blip on the radar screen." 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi didn't even bother addressing the office staff when he became general 
manager. The only new rule was that he wanted messages limited to two minutes 
on the voice mail. Certainly, he wasn't demanding, arriving at 9 every morning, 
leaving at 5 and wondering why the rest of the world gets stressed out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like all the best qualities of Mr. B. and his sons are all rolled into 
Bill," said Cathy Carey, who has been a secretary for four members of the 
Bavasi clan. "I don't know how to describe him. It's not that he's laid back, 
but just so, uh, mellow. His temperament is not extreme either way." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tim Mead, Angel assistant general manager: "He's a throwback to the '60s 
without the long hair and beads. To this day, I've never seen him lose his 
temper. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greatest tribute to Bill Bavasi is that in my 13 years with the Angels, 
I've never heard a player in our clubhouse run him down. To me, that's 
unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi is unflappable, maintaining a balanced approach to life. The day the 
above letter appeared in the newspaper, Wesierski telephoned him and read it 
aloud. Bavasi immediately sent for a copy, because he wanted to cut it out for 
posterity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was great," Bavasi said. "I wanted to show my wife (Tracy). It 
shows how quickly you can be a nobody in this game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The minute you understand that you're a genius when you win, and a bum when 
you lose, you can relax." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "None of my boys ever wanted to be President of the United States, but they 
all wanted to be GM of a baseball team."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Buzzie Bavasi 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Buzzie and his wife, Evit, said they never prodded their four sons to enter 
the baseball business. Yet everyone but Chris developed a passion for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 There is Peter, whose personality most resembles that of his father. He once 
was general manager of the Toronto Blue Jays and Cleveland Indians and now is 
president of Sportsticker. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I called up Billy and congratulated him," Peter said, "I told him that 
he's now a future ex-GM. Hey, doesn't everyone get fired in this business?" 
</P>
<P>
 There's Chris, 47, whose first job in baseball was shuttling beer kegs at 
Dodger Stadium. It would be his last. He went to Northern Arizona University, 
fell in love with Flagstaff and today is mayor of the town. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here with every intent of going back," Chris said from Arizona, "but 
this place really grows on you. I just never developed the interest in baseball 
like my brothers." 
</P>
<P>
 There's Bob, 40, who has owned the Class-A Everett (Wash.) Giants for 10 
years. He still remembers how Buzzie and Peter scouted the church where Bob got 
married in 1981, trying to find the pews with the best reception. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had impeccable credentials for baseball," Bob said, "because I got a birth 
certificate with the right name on it." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's Bill, the first son in baseball history to become a general 
manager with the same club and ownership as his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no doubt in my mind that he'd eventually make it," Buzzie said. "Of 
all my sons, I knew he'd be the one who'd get into baseball. He's going to be a 
great one, because he's learned from all our mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Buzzie, 78, taught his boys everything he knew about the game, and as mementos 
of his affection, he and Evit presented his four World Series championship 
rings to their sons. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys each randomly selected a ring at Buzzie's 70th birthday party in 
1985, and Bill wound up drawing the most cherished of the collection: It was 
the 1955 Dodgers' championship ring, the only one ever won in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done my share," Buzzie says. "Now it's up to Bill to start a new family 
collection."

LILLEHAMMER / '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; DRAMA MOVES INSIDE RINK; FIGURE SKATING: 
THERE'S MORE TO EVENT THAN THE KERRIGAN-HARDING SAGA. BAIUL, BONALY ARE EARLY 
FAVORITES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Based on the media coverage they have received, it might seem as if there are 
only two contenders in women's figure skating at the Winter Olympics, Nancy 
Kerrigan and Tonya Harding. In fact, there are as many characters in this drama 
as in a Russian novel. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, tabloid fans, that is not a subtle reference to "Crime and Punishment." 
This is a story about figure skating and the women who will compete, starting 
with tonight's technical program. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Kerrigan was injured in an assault Jan. 6 at the national championships 
in Detroit, which Harding's ex-husband and others allege Harding helped plan, 
neither woman was expected to cause much fuss here. Harding did not even 
qualify for the 1993 World Championships, and Kerrigan finished fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Because no American woman won a medal, the United States was restricted to 
fewer than three competitors in the Winter Games for only the second time since 
1924. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan and Harding have improved since last winter, or at least that was the 
consensus when they arrived in Detroit, but they are not the way to bet. In the 
most recent line posted by Ladbrooke's of London, Ukraine's Oksana Baiul was 
the favorite, followed by France's Surya Bonaly, then Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 The contenders: OKSANA BAIUL, 16, Ukraine 
</P>
<P>
 The waif-like Baiul (By-YUL) established herself as the overwhelming favorite 
last winter, when she became the youngest world champion since Sonja Henie in 
1928. She was just the young woman judges were searching for, a ballerina on 
ice. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether it is because everyone in the sport is scrutinizing her more than 
they did before or whether her body is maturing, it has become evident in 
recent months that she is not as strong or as consistent with her jumps as some 
of her competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 She also was distracted during training by reporters who found their way to 
her Ukrainian training sites, initially in her hometown of Dneprpetrovski and 
later in Odessa, to hear her story. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a compelling one. Her father left home when she was 2, and she did not 
see him again until the funeral of her mother, who had died of cancer, 11 years 
later. Orphaned, Baiul slept on a cot in the rink where she trained until her 
coach left for Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to step in, Galina Zmievskaya initially demurred because she knew she 
would be required to serve not only as a coach but a parent. But her most 
successful student, 1992 Olympic champion Viktor Petrenko, talked her into it. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is only one girl," he said. "How much can she cost?" 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, Baiul was the world champion. Weeping with joy afterward, she 
told her coach, "These tears are God's kisses from my mother in heaven." SURYA 
BONALY, 20, France 
</P>
<P>
 A former gymnast, Bonaly (Bone-a-LEE) will never skate with the grace 
necessary to win true acceptance among the judges. But she may win a gold medal 
because she can out-jump almost every woman to compete in the sport and many of 
the men. She is so powerful that she has difficulty finding skates strong 
enough to withstand the torque of her takeoffs without wobbling. 
</P>
<P>
 Exacting revenge for her second-place finish to Baiul in last year's World 
Championships, Bonaly recently won her fourth consecutive European 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonaly's story is almost as intriguing as Baiul's. She was adopted by a gym 
teacher and an ecologist who reared her on a diet of macrobiotic food and Zen. 
</P>
<P>
 They told reporters for years that she had been born on Reunion, an island in 
the Indian Ocean. A French magazine even paid for her to spend a weekend there 
so it could photograph her on the beach, surrounded by coconuts. But as Bonaly 
approached 18, when the record of her birth by French law would become 
available, they admitted that she had been born in Nice. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne Bonaly is a stereotypical skating mother who scared off numerous 
coaches and even Surya for a while. But Bonaly, a practice-a-holic who works 
out eight hours a day, could not stay away, and, with the assistance of Frank 
Carroll during summers at Lake Arrowhead's Ice Castle, has improved her style. 
CHEN LU, 17, China 
</P>
<P>
 Another woman who makes the summer pilgrimage to figure skating's new Mecca at 
Lake Arrowhead, there to train with Carlo Fassi, Chen emerged with a 
sixth-place finish in the 1992 Winter Olympics, one behind Bonaly, then vaulted 
to third in the subsequent World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 She, however, seems to have stalled there, again winning the bronze in last 
winter's World Championships, and is believed to have only an outside chance of 
improving here. 
</P>
<P>
 Chen's mother is a table tennis instructor, and her father is a former ice 
hockey player in the Jilin province of northeast China, who taught all three of 
his daughters to skate. 
</P>
<P>
 But two of them quit because they did not believe they could become 
competitive athletes and remain feminine, a faulty premise that Chen disproved. 
</P>
<P>
 The first figure skater of note in a country with more than a billion people 
and only 10 indoor ice rinks, Chen, called Lu Lu by her friends, had no role 
models, developing her artistic approach by studying videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, she sometimes seems mechanical. A smile here and there would 
help. But she more often loses points for the inconsistency of her jumps, a 
problem that has been exacerbated as her center of gravity has shifted with 
age. TONYA HARDING, 23, U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 A drag-racing, gun-toting, pool-hustling, cigarette-smoking hellion from the 
wrong side of the tracks in Portland, Ore., she was an outsider in the sport 
even before this mess with Kerrigan. But when she is on, the judges cannot deny 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 She, however, has not been really on since 1991, when she became only the 
second woman, the first American, to land the demanding triple axel and, for a 
brief, glistening moment, had no equals in the world as she upset Kristi 
Yamaguchi for the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Enduring a series of on- and off-ice crises, her career since has steadily 
descended. She was second in the world in 1991, fourth in the Olympics and 
sixth in the World Championships in 1992 and off the charts in 1993. The fact 
that she is even here is a tribute to her perseverance. Although she has worked 
hard to soften her style, judges do not think much more of her in that category 
than they do Bonaly. But if Harding survives the technical program and lands 
the triple axel in the freestyle, a feat she has not accomplished since the 
fall of '91, look out. NANCY KERRIGAN, 24, U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Nancy vs. Tonya, good vs. evil morality play presented live and in 
color for the last six weeks, Kerrigan has been portrayed by some as a New 
England ice princess. In fact, she is as blue collar as they come. The daughter 
of a welder and a legally blind mother, she grew up playing ice hockey on 
outdoor rinks with her brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 As a junior figure skater, she was considered a jumper. But as she matured, 
she developed long, clean lines and an elegant style that often was compared to 
Katarina Witt's. 
</P>
<P>
 The flip side of that transformation was that Kerrigan no longer could count 
on her jumps, a problem that her coaches considered mental. When she began 
seeing a sports psychologist in 1991, she had her best year, finishing third in 
the world.  
</P>
<P>
 But she is a shy, introspective woman who did not like having her psyche 
probed and quit seeing the psychologist a year later. Although she finished 
third in the Olympics and second in the world in 1992, her skating went 
backward. Favored to win the world championship last year, she finished fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Persuaded to return to a sports psychologist, she entered this season with 
renewed confidence and was skating marvelously before the assault in Detroit 
that knocked her out of the national championships. She has not competed since 
early December, so it is anyone's guess how she will perform here. KATARINA 
WITT, 28, Germany 
</P>
<P>
 A two-time gold medalist who took advantage of a new rule that allowed 
professionals to return to serious competition, Witt chose to go for it even 
though she has been left far behind by the younger women in technical ability. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of that, critics called her comeback a publicity stunt. She has proven 
them wrong. Not only is she in better shape than she was when she won her 
second gold medal in 1988, her freestyle program is more demanding than was her 
Carmen in Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really flirting my way through that one," she acknowledges.  
</P>
<P>
 This time, she has a message. She is skating her freestyle program to the Pete 
Seeger anti-war hymn, "Where Have All The Flowers Gone?," as a tribute to 
Sarajevo, where she won her first gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 She does not have the tricks to win, but only Baiul can challenge her 
artistically.

POSSIBILITIES ABOUND IN LIKELY MANNING TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Clipper General Manager Elgin Baylor has been directed to trade Danny Manning 
by owner Donald T. Sterling, a source says, although they may take it down to 
Thursday's 6 p.m. PST deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the best of the known options: 
</P>
<P>
 Hawks -- They're offering Dominique Wilkins, 34, and also about to become a 
free agent.Sterling likes it, but Baylor doesn't. Unless the owner pulls rank, 
it's dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat -- Miami offered Glen Rice before the season, but now it's Harold Miner 
plus Grant Long or John Salley. The Clippers aren't interested. 
</P>
<P>
 Trail Blazers -- The Clippers can have Terry Porter or Harvey Grant plus James 
Robinson or Tracy Murray, plus "other considerations," such as Portland taking 
little-used Randy Woods off the Clippers' hands. Still on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 Magic -- The Clippers can have Dennis Scott and Anthony Avent, plus Anthony 
Bowie or Todd Lichti, plus two No. 1 picks, one of which would be the choice 
Orlando gets from Seattle this spring. The Magic will also take Woods. The 
Clippers don't like it, but it's still on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 Knicks -- They want to work a three-way deal with Sacramento: The Clippers get 
Lionel Simmons and Rolando Blackman; the Kings get Anthony Mason and Hubert 
Davis; the Knicks get Manning. Still on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockets -- They were willing to give up their starting forwards, Otis Thorpe 
and Robert Horry, but owner Les Alexander couldn't get a signal from Manning's 
agent, Ron Grinker, and pulled back. 
</P>
<P>
 Hornets -- They offered any combination of their players except Alonzo 
Mourning and Larry Johnson. The Clippers weren't interested. MARK HEISLER

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; SNOW SIGNS PACT, SALMON IS CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel first baseman J.T. Snow, who resurrected memories of Wally World with 
his torrid rookie start last season, signed a one-year contract Tuesday for 
$200,000 and $25,000 in incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels also are on the verge of signing right fielder Tim Salmon to a 
three- or four-year contract, the largest contract given to any second-year 
player in Angel history. Salmon, the American League's rookie of the year last 
season, is being offered $4 million over three years and about $7 million over 
four years. The deal is expected to be consummated perhaps as early as 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi also continues to remain optimistic in his 
attempts to sign starter Mark Langston to a three-year contract extension with 
an option year for the fourth season. Bavasi and Arn Tellem, Langston's agent, 
are scheduled to meet later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Snow hopes that a consistent season will provide the kind of 
offensive numbers that merit a multiyear career for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a much better idea what to expect this time around," Snow said. "I had 
such a great start last year, and by midseason, I felt like I already played a 
full season." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow, who was acquired in the Jim Abbott trade with the New York Yankees, 
opened the season batting .407 with six homers and 17 RBIs in the first 15 
games. Yet, he was in the minor leagues by the end of July, and wound up 
hitting .241 with 16 homers and 57 RBIs for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, I was under such a microscope," said Snow, who got married in the 
off-season. "It was a very difficult year for me to handle. I think this year 
will be different. I can come into camp without having people check me out all 
the time. If anything, the spotlight is going to be on Bo (Jackson) and Tim 
(Salmon)." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels also signed utility infielder Rod Correia to a one-year contract 
Tuesday, and now are left with only six unsigned players on their 40-man 
roster. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bo Jackson, who wowed the crowd Tuesday by hitting three consecutive home runs 
in batting practice, said he recently signed a movie contract for his life 
story. He is scheduled to meet with a Hollywood scriptwriter during the next 
four days, with production expected to begin this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still not sure who's going to play me," Jackson said, "but it might be 
(Morris Chestnut) from 'Boyz N the Hood.' I'm looking forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, it takes time for news to reach these parts: 
</P>
<P>
 While there still is a designated parking spot in the front row at Tempe 
Diablo Stadium for Whitey Herzog, who resigned seven weeks ago, there is none 
for Bavasi, the new general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi has yet to park in Herzog's spot.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Buck Rodgers, on the evolution of players' physical fitness for spring 
training: "There's so much money to be made, players are working out all winter 
now. In my first two years, I had to work in the off-season by selling cars and 
real estate. I had no choice because our children had this bad habit of eating 
in the winter time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers is scheduled to give depositions in two weeks involving his 
$25-million lawsuit stemming from the Angels' 1992 bus crash. A hearing is 
expected in November or December. BOB NIGHTENGALE

MALIGNANT TUMOR REMOVED FROM WHITE SOX'S RADINSKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Radinsky, Chicago White Sox reliever, had a malignant lymph node removed 
from his neck, and probably will sit out the season while undergoing treatment 
to prevent the spread of Hodgkin's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Radinsky, 25, has returned to his home in Simi Valley to begin chemotherapy 
and radiation treatments that could last six to eight months.Ron Schueler, 
White Sox general manager, said Tuesday there was an outside chance Radinsky 
could pitch this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodgkin's disease is a chronic disease caused by the enlargement of lymph 
nodes and other lymph tissues. NHL star Mario Lemieux, NFL lineman Karl Nelson 
and Olympic wrestler Jeff Blatnick are among other athletes who have been 
afflicted with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's curable, but you never know when you deal with chemo and radiation," 
said Schueler, whose wife died from leukemia in 1991. "There are a lot more 
severe ones than the one he has. But it's still cancer. I saw it with my wife 
when she was having chemo and radiation. It's not a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Radinsky underwent tests after complaining of discomfort on the left side of 
his neck. The surgery was performed Monday by oncologists at Sarasota Memorial 
Hospital. X-rays revealed no spread of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cure rate on this type of cancer is 80 to 90%," Schueler said. "The 
doctors are real optimistic. They think he will be fine, even to the point that 
he'll be weakened by all this treatment, but at times will be able to do a 
little physical therapy to keep his muscle structure up." 
</P>
<P>
 Radinsky appeared in 78 games with the White Sox last season with an 8-2 
record and a 4.28 ERA.

LILLEHAMMER / '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; SHORT-TRACK SKATERS WIN THEIR PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The four women of the U.S. 3,000-meter short-track speedskating team were in 
their Olympic Amphitheatre locker room late Tuesday, crying over the injustice 
of their fourth-place finish, when their coach, Jack Mortell, rushed in and 
said perhaps the sweetest words they will ever hear in their athletic careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fix your hair," he said, "you got a medal." 
</P>
<P>
 Mortell protested immediately after the race because a Chinese woman, who was 
not skating at the time, stepped in front of American Nikki Ziegelmeyer, who 
was, and caused her to fall. But when the officials results were posted and 
China was listed as second and the United States as fourth, the U.S. women 
assumed Mortell's pleas had failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was going to cry for the rest of my life," Ziegelmeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the news from Mortell that China had been disqualified and the U.S. 
women would be awarded the bronze medal, reserving them a place on the podium 
with first-place South Korea and second-place Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all had to go back to the mirror and dry our tears," said Cathy Turner, 
whose bronze was her third medal in the last two Olympics. She was one of three 
members of this year's 3,000-meter relay team, along with Ziegelmeyer and Amy 
Peterson, who earned a silver medal in that race two years ago at Albertville, 
France, where she also won a gold medal in the individual 500 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 These U.S. women are becoming accustomed to reprieves. 
</P>
<P>
 Without Turner, who took a year off to become the first speedskater to tour as 
a headliner with the Ice Capades, they failed last year to qualify for the 
Olympic 3,000-meter relay here. But only a few days before the Winter Olympics 
began, they were informed that three teams ahead of them -- Australia, Japan 
and North Korea -- had withdrawn, giving them a berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner and Peterson already were here to compete in individual events, but 
Ziegelmeyer and the fourth relay-team member, Karen Cashman, had resigned 
themselves to training at the U.S. Olympic Committee's education center in 
Marquette, Mich., for next month's World Championships.

LILLEHAMMER / '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; U.S. COULD BE BUMP IN ROAD FOR FINLAND; 
HOCKEY: AMERICANS HOPE TO USE AGGRESSIVE CHECKING TO KNOCK UNDEFEATED FINNS OFF 
TRACK IN TONIGHT'S QUARTERFINAL GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The team that never believed it could win and the team that couldn't win until 
it had to will meet today in the quarterfinals of the Olympic hockey tournament 
that looks more like a mismatch than a matchup. 
</P>
<P>
 Finland, known for producing teams with world-class skills and fragile 
psyches, began to shed that reputation here with a 5-0 round-robin record and a 
defense that gave up only four goals. A victory today would remove that label.  
</P>
<P>
 "So far, we have played the best hockey, but in a game like the quarterfinals, 
you also need luck," Coach Curt Lindstrom said. "You can't say we will win, but 
like every other team, we have also the possibility to take the gold. It is 
very open." 
</P>
<P>
 To Brian Rolston and his U.S. teammates, who faced an early trip home until 
they beat Italy on Monday, it's American ingenuity and grit against a team 
that's skillful but squeamish about being hit. The United States routed Finland 
in December, 6-2, but Finland has since changed much of its personnel.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to pressure their defense and make them cough up the puck, keep the 
puck low (in the offensive zone) and bang their defensemen," Rolston said. "We 
have to throw everything at the net and crash the net, just like a North 
American hockey game. We've got to finish our checks. Against Sweden (in a 
near-comeback on Saturday), in the third period we were playing a North 
American style, finishing our checks, and they were backing down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know how to do it and I think we'll get it done. If we don't win, we don't 
go on. We've played against that sort of pressure all year, and we've played 
good under pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 The winner will play the winner of today's quarterfinal game between Canada 
(3-1-1) and the Czech Republic (3-2-0). In other quarterfinal matchups, Group B 
winner Slovakia (3-0-2), seeded 12th, will try to keep its upset streak alive 
against top-seeded Russia (3-2-0) and Germany (3-2-0) faces Sweden (3-1-1). 
</P>
<P>
 In the preliminary round, Finland held opponents to an average of 12.4 shots 
on goal and fewer than one goal. Lindstrom alternated goaltenders Jarmo Myllys 
-- the former Minnesota North Star and San Jose Shark -- and Jukka Tammi. He 
wouldn't reveal today's starter, but it is Tammi's turn if the rotation holds. 
</P>
<P>
 The goalies' job has been made easier by a new defensive system that 
emphasizes constant motion, puck control and persistent forechecking in the 
neutral zone. Lindstrom's biggest contribution, though, is how he has 
strengthened his players' self-assurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's talking a lot to us and trying to get our confidence up," winger Mikko 
Makela said. "He's always saying, 'You're good! You're good!' For Finns, it's 
important to hear that all the time because otherwise we get down." 
</P>
<P>
 When their spirits went down, their bodies often followed if they were hit. 
Not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the USA can do that to us," said center Raimo Helminen, 
Makela's linemate. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lindstrom, who is in his second year as coach, "They didn't have the 
self-confidence. They were always afraid to meet Russia, Sweden, Canada. Now 
this year, we have beaten those teams, but not the USA team. We have beaten 
Sweden, Czechoslovakia (the Czech Republic) and Russia and we have more 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 That has been apparent to U.S. Coach Tim Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a very complete team and they play a very effective style," said 
Taylor, whose team was an inconsistent 1-1-3 in group play. "So far in this 
tournament, they've made the fewest mistakes and played the best defense. 
You've got to give Finland an awful lot of credit. They've always taken a back 
seat to a lot of other nations in terms of hockey prowess, like Sweden, Russia, 
Czechoslovakia. Their coach has done a marvelous job." 
</P>
<P>
 Finland's offense was as formidable as its defense, averaging five goals. 
Helminen, with six points, and Makela, with five, are among the top scorers, 
and the line of Ville Peltonen, Saku Koivu and Jere Lehtinen has been dazzling 
with its quickness and puck handling. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't take long shots," said goalie Garth Snow, today's probable U.S. 
starter. "A goalie might only see 15 shots, but eight of them might be great 
shots from the slot. You have to be mentally prepared and try to keep the goals 
against to a minimum." 
</P>
<P>
 Each coach saw a potential weakness in the other's team. Lindstrom said the 
Americans are mistake-prone while when forechecking but added, "The American 
players are very good and have a very good fighting spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Taylor: "It's really going to come down to emotional strength. . . . 
We've got a lot of emotion going for us. We're not going into this thing 
fearing the outcome. We're going into it looking forward to the challenge."

 Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding finally take to the ice today in the

there will be no live television coverage. 
</P>

 There will, however, be live radio coverage.Harding will skate eighth at about

 CBS Radio announced Tuesday that Paul Wylie, 1992 Olympic silver medalist, 
will provide analysis. Wylie is in Norway with CBS-TV, announcing short-track 
speedskating. 
</P>
<P>
 TNT's weekday Olympic coverage runs from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., and the cable 
network will show some of the figure skating competitors, but not Kerrigan and 
Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS, which paid $295 million for the rights to the Lillehammer Games, will 
embargo the Harding and Kerrigan routines. No television outlet will be able to 
show them until after CBS shows them on its prime-time show, which runs from 8 
to 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the first 10 days, CBS has averaged a national Nielsen rating of 
nearly 26 for its prime-time telecasts. That compares with the previous record 
of 23.6 set by ABC at the 1980 Lake Placid Games, with the U.S. hockey team's 
"Miracle on Ice." 
</P>
<P>
 The CBS audiences have been as high as 78 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure we'll go over 100 million (viewers)," said Verne Lundquist, who will 
do play-by-play television coverage of the women's figure-skating showdown. 
"There's hope we might approach Super Bowl numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 The free-skate portion of women's figure skating is scheduled Friday. The 
skating order will be determined by today's competition. LARRY STEWART

LILLEHAMMER / '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; THE JUDGES; EYES WILL BE ON THESE TWO WHILE 
THEY SCORE SKATERS 
</P>

<P>
 Judging controversies are as much a part of figure skating as sequins, but two 
judges in the women's competition that begins tonight in the Winter Olympics 
will be particularly scrutinized. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred Koritek of Ukraine is the father of the man who coached gold-medal 
contender Oksana Baiul for seven years.When his son emigrated to Canada in 
1992, leaving Baiul behind, Koritek, the president of Ukraine's figure skating 
association, made the telephone call that brought the skater together with her 
current coach, Galina Zmievskaya. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if that constituted a conflict of interest, International Skating Union 
technical delegate Chuck DeMore of the United States said, "No comment, but 
it's a good question." 
</P>
<P>
 The other judge with a close tie to a skater is Germany's Jan Hoffman, the 
1980 silver medalist in the men's competition. He was coached by Jutta Mueller, 
who is Katarina Witt's longtime coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The ISU selected judges from a pool of 10 countries based on the results of 
last year's World Championships. A blind draw was held to determine which nine 
would have a representative on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing out was France, but that will not necessarily restrict its highly rated 
skater, Surya Bonaly. The United States had no judge in 1992, when Kristi 
Yamaguchi finished first and Nancy Kerrigan third. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. judge this year is Margaret Ann Wier of Park City, Utah. The sister 
of Hugh Graham, former U.S. Figure Skating Assn. president, she was the last 
woman to win medals in the national championships in singles and pairs until 
Yamaguchi did it in 1989. RANDY HARVEY

LILLEHAMMER / '94 WINTER OLYMPICS; TECHNICAL PROGRAM; THE TRICK IS TO STAY ON 
FEET FOR CHANCE TO PERFORM A FEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The technical program that 27 women will skate tonight in the Olympic 
Amphitheatre is less a competition than it is a survival test. Those who 
combine the most challenging jumps, spins and footwork, remain on their feet 
and look elegant keep their dreams of winning a medal from the Winter Olympics 
alive for another 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Friday night's freestyle program counts for more, two-thirds of the 
final score, skaters say they become more nervous before the technical program. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you miss something, you get nailed," Brian Boitano says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is considered one of the best technical program skaters ever, his 
chance to win a gold medal in the men's competition here last week ended 50 
seconds after he had stepped onto the ice when he fell on a required 
combination jump. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't win the gold medal in the technical program," says Nancy Kerrigan's 
coach, Evy Scotvold. "But you can lose it." 
</P>
<P>
 There are eight required elements in the 2-minute 40-second program, including 
two footwork sequences, two spins and a spin combination, two jumps and a jump 
combination. 
</P>
<P>
 Failure to perform any of them requires an automatic 0.5 deduction by each of 
the nine judges. There are less severe deductions for lesser errors. Unless 
they commit major mistakes, the most accomplished skaters often are separated 
by how well they perform the jumps, especially those in combination. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for Germany's Katarina Witt and Japan's Yuka Sato, the contenders here 
all plan the same combination jump, a difficult triple lutz-double toe. Witt's 
triple toe-double toe and Sato's triple toe loop-double toe are considered less 
challenging. RANDY HARVEY

NO HORNS OF DILEMMA; CALIFORNIA'S TULE ELK, ONCE NEAR EXTINCTION, ARE HERE TO 
STAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the green pickup truck bounces slowly over the dusty road, toward several 
large tule elk grazing in a meadow, the animals turn and stare cautiously, but 
show no signs of fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Maury Morning Star drives on, and the bull elk, some with impressive antlers, 
resume grazing. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon they will drop their antlers and start growing new ones. In the spring, 
the females will begin calving, and in the heat of summer, during the rutting 
season, the strongest male will bugle loudly to warn the smaller bulls that he 
is the master and that the cows are his and his only. 
</P>
<P>
 Antlers are sure to tangle. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is life for the 28 tule elk confined to the Tule Elk State Reserve, a 
956-acre spread of flat grassland and a few small marshes, surrounded by a 
seemingly endless expanse of cotton fields and cattle ranches. 
</P>
<P>
 And such is life for Morning Star, of the Department of Parks and Recreation, 
who takes visitors on prearranged tours over the reserve and whose job it is to 
see that no harm comes to the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 For the visitor, it might seem a sad state of affairs for the elk to have to 
live behind a fence after thriving in this region in much the way bison once 
roamed the Great Plains. 
</P>
<P>
 But fence or no, they still have the chance to drop their antlers in favor of 
new and larger ones, to bring little tule elk into the world and, for some 
anyway, to mate with female tule elk. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do OK," Morning Star says. 
</P>
<P>
 And because they do, so do free-roaming herds of tule elk throughout 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it opened in 1932, Tule Elk State Reserve has been supplying elk for the 
California Department of Fish and Game's reintroduction program, which has 
succeeded in bringing the animals back from possibly as few as two in the late 
1800s to nearly 3,000 in 22 herds scattered throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that there are more than 2,700 animals now is pretty remarkable," 
says Jon Fischer, elk project coordinator for the DFG. "Especially when you 
consider that we had very few elk at one point in time -- definitely less than 
20, maybe less than 10 and maybe only two. I doubt that there are too many 
other animals on earth that have gotten down that low in numbers that have 
recovered." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tule elk, one of three subspecies of elk in California, used to roam the San 
Joaquin and Sacramento valleys by the thousands, some belonging to herds as 
large as 2,000. Their range extended from Butte County north of Sacramento to 
Buena Vista Lake near Bakersfield in Kern County, and from the foothills of the 
western slope of the Sierra Nevada across the Great Valley to the coastal 
mountain ranges. 
</P>
<P>
 An account in 1850 by a hiker walking from Stockton to Mariposa told of "bands 
of elk, deer and antelope in such numbers that they actually darkened the 
plains for miles, and looked in the distance like great herds of cattle." 
</P>
<P>
 But by then, the tule elks' demise had already begun. 
</P>
<P>
 The "fur-brigades," starting in 1827, had made a substantial impact on the 
animals. But it was the Gold Rush in 1848, and the influx of settlers it 
generated, that brought the animals to the brink of extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 Cattle prices rose steadily during the period, and cheaper elk meat became 
increasingly popular among settlers and miners.  
</P>
<P>
 Rather than waste ammunition on the animals, some hunters, or vaqueros , would 
ride alongside huge herds of fleeing elk and bring them down one by one with a 
swipe across the hind legs with a long-handled machete, or luna . 
</P>
<P>
 By 1850, the herds of the Sacramento Valley were completely wiped out. 
</P>
<P>
 And not long after, only a small herd remained in California, in the tule 
marshes near Buena Vista Lake. But hunters were relentless, pursuing the 
animals in boats with lookouts atop a ladder on the mast to see over the tules. 
</P>
<P>
 Draining of the reservoirs for agricultural development further exposed the 
animals, and by 1870 the tule elk subspecies -- later identified as such -- 
appeared to have ceased to exist. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1875, two tule elk -- possibly the last pair -- were sighted in the 
marshes near Buena Vista Lake on the Miller and Lux Ranch. Henry Miller, by 
ordering his employees to protect the tule elk on his ranch, began a process 
that would eventually enable the animals to recover. 
</P>
<P>
 The elk on Miller and Lux reproduced and the herd grew rapidly; then in 1904, 
the two ranchers offered part of the herd to the government. The offer was 
accepted and the first elk roundup and drive was organized. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after the drive was under way, the first elk stampede occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 According to an account in The Times in 1905, the animals cooperated until 
they neared a pen, at which time "the wildest terror prevailed, and the herd 
stampeded, heading for the hills. Once there, all the work of the vaqueros 
would count for naught. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throwing caution to the wind, they spurred their cow ponies on in pursuit to 
head them off. Failing in this, some had recourse to their lassos, and in a few 
minutes a dozen or more of the animals were roped." 
</P>
<P>
 Once in the pen, which was surrounded by dozens of onlookers, they began 
"hurling themselves against the fence and against each other one minute, then 
huddling together in abject terror the next." 
</P>
<P>
 Several died in the fury, and of the handful of animals that made it into the 
railroad cars, only one would survive the trip to the government's pen in 
Sequoia National Park on the Kaweah River. 
</P>
<P>
 But by 1914, the Miller and Lux herd had grown to 400 animals, and they caused 
such damage to the alfalfa fields and fences that small groups of animals were 
shipped to other locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller died in 1917, and the property was subdivided into smaller ranches, 
whose farmers eventually petitioned the government for relief from elk 
depredation on their lands. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact of the matter is that tule elk have a very large home range -- 
they'll wander a great distance," DFG coordinator Fischer says. "They don't 
respect fences. They don't respect agricultural crops in any way shape or form 
. . . and that sets the stage for conflict." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1932, the State Tule Elk Reserve was established, and about 175 animals on 
the former Miller and Lux were given a home. From there, some were moved to 
start new homes for California's smallest of three subspecies of elk, reaching 
weights of about 600 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Tule Elk State Reserve became "the source," according to Fischer. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 400 tule elk have been relocated from Tule Elk State Reserve since 
it opened, one as recently as last summer to add a bull to another herd that 
had been plagued by poachers. The herd in the Owens valley has about 400 elk. 
The largest, near San Luis Obispo, numbers about 600, and Fischer said its 
range could soon extend to the point where it merges with another herd farther 
north. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear we're not going to have 500,000 tule elk in California ever 
again," Fischer says. "There's no chance of that. But we're in a heck of a lot 
better shape now than we were 20 years ago, or than we were 120 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Relocation is much easier now through the use of tranquilizer guns and 
helicopter transports, but finding suitable habitat remains a chief obstacle in 
expanding the herds, which are currently managed through controlled hunts. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, with the help of such groups as the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, 
Nature Conservancy and Safari Club, enough money has been raised and habitat 
found to put the animals back on the map, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Morning Star, driving his green pickup back toward the office near the front 
gate of the reserve, approaches several female tule elk and a few spike bulls 
that had moved in to mingle. Their heads all turn at once to watch him drive 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 He tells of the time several elk once jumped over the 7-foot fence surrounding 
the reserve, but when approached by park personnel, they jumped back over.  
</P>
<P>
 "I really believe that the elk know they're safe here," Morning Star says, 
"because I've seen where people come up to the viewing area and they'll be 
literally feet away from the animal, and the animal just walks like nothing is 
wrong, right past the people. But if you get on the other side of the fence 
like we did, they just take off -- they won't let you near them." 
</P>
<P>
 Who can blame them?

BILL BOYARSKY: ESSAY: TRUST ALSO A CASUALTY OF CARNAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The murder of rookie Los Angeles Police Officer Christy Lynne Hamilton was 
another jagged tear in the fragile social contract between the police and the 
populace they are sworn to protect and to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 The terms of the contract are simple: We are supposed to obey the law and 
respect the police. Cops are expected to treat us fairly, not brutally. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Golly, 17, described by his friends as a speed addict, didn't give 
a damn for the contract. He killed Hamilton early Tuesday in a San Fernando 
Valley neighborhood unaccustomed to violence. Nor has the contract been 
observed by other cop killers who have murdered nine Southern California police 
officers in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, most people do care. Respect for the police drew an estimated 
4,000 people to services Monday for two slain officers from another department 
-- Palos Verdes Estates Capt. Michael Wayne Tracy and Sgt. Thomas Vanderpool, 
who were killed during a seminar in a Torrance Holiday Inn. 
</P>
<P>
 One day after those services, Officer Hamilton was killed. The fact that she 
was a mother made her killing especially sad. But no matter what the gender or 
the age, a cop's murder always carries with it powerful symbolism, posing such 
questions as these: 
</P>
<P>
 What chance do civilians have now that police officers are becoming just 
another target? Is society collapsing, with lawlessness becoming a way of life? 
Are our lives going to be forever dominated by fear? Will we withdraw into 
ourselves, cowering in our homes and cars with newly purchased handguns while 
the cops nervously eye each passerby as a prospective assassin? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All of this fear, all this killing, comes at a time when we are asking our 
police to trust us even more. Trust is the heart and soul of a new LAPD 
strategy, born of the controversy surrounding the beating of Rodney G. King. 
Called community-based policing, it depends on cooperation between police and 
civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 The police are supposed to treat us as friends, and we are supposed to respond 
in kind in a joint endeavor to prevent crime, not just deal with its 
consequences. For their part, cops are being trained to listen rather than 
confront. But these days, that is asking an awful lot. Because to hold up their 
end of the new contract, they have to gamble that they won't be gunned down by 
someone waiting for them behind a door. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought about what we want from our police after hearing of Officer 
Hamilton's death. Two years ago, I had written about how the strategy was 
working in the San Fernando Valley's Devonshire station where, coincidentally, 
Hamilton was working. 
</P>
<P>
 One of my guides was Officer Stephanie Tisdale. In the course of her rounds, 
we visited an apartment house where the manager had told Tisdale that two of 
the tenants were selling drugs. Tisdale and I walked over to the suspected 
apartment. She knocked on the door. A thin, tired-looking woman admitted us. 
She denied selling drugs, even though small pieces of tinfoil, used to wrap 
heroin, were scattered on a coffee table. 
</P>
<P>
 Tisdale looked around the apartment, poked her head into the filthy kitchen 
and messy bedroom. Then we left. The visit had been intended as a warning that 
if the woman was selling drugs, she'd better stop. It made more sense than a 
huge police raid, with the cops randomly arresting the innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday morning, as I recalled the experience, I wondered what would have 
happened if an armed drug dealer had been waiting in the bedroom when Tisdale 
looked in. She might have been killed. Are good officers such as Tisdale now 
wondering the same thing each and every time they knock on a door?

 I called one of the architects of community-based policing, Deputy Chief Mark 
Kroeker, and asked him whether the cop killings will create even more fear 
among police officers and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unsettling to people when an officer dies because they feel they have 
lost their shield," said Kroeker, who now is responsible for bringing community 
policing to a wide area of South L.A., where crime is high and conflict between 
cops and residents has been most intense. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you believe people have lost their protection? I asked. "No," said Kroeker. 
"I put us all in the same area of violence. It is a violent world to be a cop 
and it is a violent world not to be a cop." 
</P>
<P>
 This last weekend, Kroeker said, seven people were killed by gunfire in a wide 
area of South L.A. The point is, you can get shot whether you're a civilian or 
a cop. "There are many things," he said, "that make us similar, rather than 
dissimilar." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, we're stuck in this bloody world together, civilians and cops, 
sharing risks -- and sharing the responsibility of stopping the violence that 
makes our lives dangerous. "We're all vulnerable," Kroeker said, "whether we 
are in a black-and-white or a little green Toyota." Violence Against Police In 
California 
</P>
<P>
 The number of police officers killed and assaulted in the line of duty in 
California has fluctuated over the last several years. An assault is defined as 
serious injury to an officer, or the use of a dangerous weapon or substantial 
resistance.

 In The U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of officers killed in the line of duty has decreased since a peak 
of 134 in 1973. The rates for all assaults-ranging from mere threats to the 
actual battering of officers-has fluctuated. 03,06,17,20 Number of Number of

DEATH OF FIRST LAPD WOMAN OFFICER KILLED IN LINE OF DUTY CAME DURING ROUTINE 
STOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Two months after her graduation from the Los Angeles Police Academy, Officer 
Tina Kerbrat had to drive a murder victim's mother back to the North Hollywood 
station and question the woman about her son. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a task that left the rookie officer -- herself the mother of two young 
children -- saddened and shaken. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told me afterward that she didn't think she could go through that, that 
she never wanted to be on that end of things, where her children are hurt," 
fellow Officer Felicia Green recalled later. "When I heard what had happened to 
Tina, that story kept flashing through my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 11, 1991 -- four months after her graduation -- Kerbrat became the 
first Los Angeles policewoman to be slain in the line of duty.  
</P>
<P>
 To honor her, the department created a special Police Academy award in her 
name -- an award, ironically, that was presented to Christy Hamilton, who on 
Tuesday became the second Los Angeles policewoman killed on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerbrat and her partner, Officer Earl Valladares, had been patrolling a bleak 
industrial strip before dawn when they saw two men walking down the street, 
sharing beers, investigators said. Drinking beer in public is a Municipal Code 
violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Valladares, a 20-year veteran, asked his 34-year-old partner if she had ever 
written an "open-container violation," according to Capt. Bruce Mitchell, their 
commanding officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said she hadn't done one yet, so they decided to pull over," Mitchell 
said. "It was routine. It was a training exercise." 
</P>
<P>
 As Kerbrat stepped out of the car, one of the men, saying nothing, fired four 
times with a revolver. One of the shots struck Kerbrat in the face, and she 
fell backward, mortally wounded, into the patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
 Valladares fired 10 shots at the gunman, 32-year-old Jose Amaya, an 
undocumented immigrant from El Salvador. Amaya was pronounced dead at the 
scene. The other man, James Welch, 24, was arrested on suspicion of public 
drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerbrat was survived by her husband, Los Angeles Firefighter Tim Kerbrat, 
their 6-year-old son, Craig, and their daughter, Nicole, 3. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the academy, Kerbrat had been older and more confident than her classmates, 
who called her " 'Mom,' because she looked out for everyone," according to one 
of them. She viewed police work "as a chance to do some good," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 4,000 mourners gathered to pay homage at her funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 "We as a community have not done what is necessary to make our streets, our 
neighborhoods, our homes and our children safe," Archbishop Roger M. Mahony 
said at her Requiem Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until we do this for you," Mahoney said to the officers present, "we must bow 
in shame and ask for your forgiveness."

COMPTON MARKS 1ST ANNIVERSARY OF DOUBLE SLAYING; MOURNING: CANDELIGHT MARCH 
HONORS TWO OFFICERS. CASE HAS STILL NOT BEEN BROUGHT TO TRIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Even before the gunfire erupted Tuesday, leaving another police officer 
fallen, members of the Compton Police Department were in mourning. 
</P>
<P>
 Clerks wore black T-shirts; a few off-duty officers donned black baseball 
caps. A solemn mood existed throughout the labyrinthine hallways of the brick 
station house, where police were left comparing the murder of Los Angeles 
Police Department Officer Christy Hamilton with their own tragedy: the double 
slaying, exactly a year ago to the day, of two Compton patrolmen who were shot 
to death, execution-style. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, a year later, LAPD has someone killed," said Compton Detective Marvin 
Branscomb. "We don't want Feb. 22 ever to come again. It's really traumatic." 
</P>
<P>
 Branscomb, one of the lead investigators in the Compton case, wore a 
commemorative pin featuring badges of slain Officers Kevin Michael Burrell, 29, 
and James Wayne MacDonald, 23. They became the first two Compton officers ever 
murdered in the line of duty after they stopped a red pickup truck late at 
night at Rosecrans and Dwight avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The murders had a devastating impact on the 66-year-old Police Department. To 
mark the one-year anniversary of the deaths, officers, friends and family 
members were expected to stage a candlelight march Tuesday evening from the 
station house to the site of the slayings about two miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 There, they were planning to dedicate a plaque honoring the fallen officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't know how painful it really was -- it was a lot of pain," said 
Compton Detective Arellanes, a 13-year veteran who was preparing to join the 
march. "It's really sad we had to lose those two officers -- good men, well 
liked, dedicated to the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Like others, Arellanes expressed frustration that the only suspect in the case 
still has not been brought to trial. The case sparked a massive cooperative 
manhunt involving the FBI, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and 
numerous other law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 A $10,000 reward was offered, and police established a 24-hour hot line to 
take tips from possible witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, those efforts led to the surrender of 23-year-old Regis Deon 
Thomas on April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, who pleaded not guilty, was bound over for trial at a weeklong 
preliminary hearing in October, said Branscomb. But it could be several more 
months before defense attorneys can review evidence they have obtained through 
legal disclosure procedures, thus clearing the way for trial, Branscomb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now held without bail at Los Angeles County Jail, Thomas faces three murder 
charges, including the two officers and a third victim, who was shot to death 
the month before at an apartment house in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to make sure it's a capital punishment case," said Compton Police 
Lt. Joe Flores, who said the murders fundamentally changed attitudes within the 
ranks of the officers. "It is, in fact, getting more dangerous," he said of the 
job. "Crooks never used to shoot at police officers the way they do now. 
They're more brave, more brazen. It's a reflection on our society, (where) 
violence is more acceptable. There has to be an end to it." 
</P>
<P>
 While talking about the murders, Flores abruptly stopped and walked away, 
unable to continue. A little later, he said, "A lot of people want to forget 
it. They can't. It's going to stay with us as long as we wear a Compton 
uniform." 
</P>
<P>
 Burrell, a 6-foot-7 officer who weighed nearly 300 pounds, had been an 
Explorer Scout who began working with the department as a teen-ager. MacDonald, 
a reserve officer who had been recruited two years earlier from Cal State Long 
Beach, was working his final day in Compton before taking a full-time job with 
the San Jose Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing them was like losing family members, said Lt. Reggie White, who 
supervised the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost indescribable," he said, expressing sympathy with those in 
Northridge, where Hamilton was killed. "It's devastating. We're going to always 
feel the impact of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Family members of the two officers attended a memorial luncheon for them 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Eric Perrodin, president of the Compton Police Officers Assn., said the 
union organized a Valentine's Day dance a week ago at the Ramada Inn, where 
about 300 guests helped raise $2,500 toward establishing a scholarship fund in 
the names of Burrell and MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Tuesday night's march, he said, "I started this vigil so the community 
wouldn't forget that these two officers gave their lives."

JUDGE ACCUSED OF FLEEING FATAL CRASH; ACCIDENT: FEMALE PASSENGER WAS THROWN 
FROM CAR THAT ROLLED OVER AFTER GETTING OFF VENTURA FREEWAY IN EAGLE ROCK. 
DAZED COMPTON MUNICIPAL COURT OFFICIAL TURNS HIMSELF IN TO AUTHORITIES.

<P>
 A Compton municipal judge has been arrested on charges of fleeing after his 
Mercedes-Benz spun out of control and crashed in Eagle Rock, leaving a woman 
passenger dead, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Albert J. Garcia, 45, was booked early Tuesday on charges of suspected 
vehicular manslaughter and drunk driving, five hours after a spectacular crash 
about 7:30 p.m. Monday on Colorado Boulevard near an off-ramp of the Ventura 
Freeway, Officer Don Cox of the Los Angeles Police Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's lawyer said Garcia -- a husband, father and seven-year veteran of 
the bench -- turned himself in after wandering from the scene in a state of 
shock, which set in when he realized that his 35-year-old passenger was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her skull was broken open on the street. It was very gory," said the lawyer, 
Robin Yanes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just started wandering around aimlessly. After a time, he went to a pay 
phone and called a friend who picked him up and took him to the nearest police 
station." 
</P>
<P>
 Jail records show that Garcia was arrested shortly before midnight, booked at 
12:44 a.m. Tuesday, and released in lieu of $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The name of Garcia's passenger was withheld by authorities pending 
notification of her family. Yanes said the woman is a close friend of the 
judge's. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's in an extraordinary state of remorse," the lawyer said. "He still seems 
to be in shock." 
</P>
<P>
 An Eastside native, Garcia worked as a trumpet player and a librarian before 
settling on a law career, graduating in 1976 from the USC Law Center. He was 
appointed to the bench in 1986 by then-Gov. George Deukmejian. By 1993, he was 
the assistant presiding judge of the Compton Municipal Court District. 
</P>
<P>
 In published profiles of the judge, lawyers describe him as good-natured and 
courteous. However, according to police reports, Garcia was involved in a fight 
with a woman five months ago in his chambers. Sources said the woman was the 
car crash victim, but police were unable to confirm that report. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses in the area just west of Pasadena and only a few miles from the 
judge's home, said the judge's leased Mercedes apparently went out of control 
as it left the freeway onto a stretch of Colorado Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The car hit a post, flew out of control and rolled for about half a block, 
they said. The woman, who apparently was not wearing a seat belt, flew out of 
the car and landed on the concrete median. 
</P>
<P>
 "That car came off the freeway like a bat out of hell," said Marie Kenner, 69, 
who was watching television when she heard the squeal of tires and a deafening 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at my husband and said, 'Uh-oh, that one hit,' " Kenner said.

UCLA SETTLES CASE ON MEDICAL WASTE DISPOSAL; ENVIRONMENT: UNIVERSITY AGREES TO 
PAY $49,500 AND CLOSE CAMPUS CREMATORY USED TO INCINERATE HUMAN REMAINS FROM 
ITS MEDICAL SCHOOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Without admitting guilt, UCLA has agreed to pay $49,500 and strengthen its 
medical waste practices to settle charges that it violated the law in disposing 
of human remains at its medical school, the university and state health 
officials announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA and the state Department of Health Services said they were happy with the 
agreement, which stems from an Oct. 31 incident in which the skipper of a 
burial-at-sea service accidentally broke open a box of ashes that UCLA had 
wanted dumped into Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The box contained cremated remains of cadavers used by the UCLA Medical 
School, but also pieces of glass and surgical equipment that the university 
admitted should not have been included. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, UCLA, which faced criminal prosecution and fines, said it 
will permanently close an on-campus crematory and send all cadavers used by its 
medical school off campus for disposal and burial. Another provision calls for 
the university to convene a statewide conference on medical waste management 
and prepare a video on sea waste management practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Eden, dean for administration at the medical school, said the 
settlement "provides the framework for new procedures that will ensure the 
effective handling of medical waste." 
</P>
<P>
 But Eden continued to insist that the university was not admitting that it had 
broke a series of environmental and waste control laws. 
</P>
<P>
 He disputed a contention that the monetary award amounted to a fine "because 
we have not been convicted of anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The skipper of the boat, David R. (Red) Saber, and environmentalists demanded 
an investigation as soon as the boxes of contaminated material were discovered 
on Saber's dock, contending that the contents of the dozen boxes left with 
Saber for disposal at sea were potentially toxic and posed a serious public 
health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 In the settlement, the state accepted an analysis by a microbiologist hired by 
UCLA who found that the remains had been incinerated at temperatures high 
enough to render the material sterile, thus posing no health threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Learning of the settlement, Saber called the results laughable because they 
came from a firm hired by UCLA. He said he would probably file a civil suit 
against UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Tamminen of the Santa Monica Bay Keeper, an environmental watchdog 
group, was critical of the settlement, saying that the state bungled the 
investigation by not taking immediate control of the boxes of remains upon 
learning of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The boxes remained with UCLA throughout the state investigation, although 
state officials were allowed to inspect and photograph them. 
</P>
<P>
 The state, in announcing the agreement, cited the analysis by the firm hired 
by UCLA that 95% of the boxes contained cremated ashes, and that 5% was 
incinerated glass and metal. 
</P>
<P>
 University and state officials had no explanation for charges by Saber and one 
state investigator that hair was found on some remains and rubber stoppers were 
in some bottles, indicating a possible low temperature in the incinerator. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack McGurk, head of the medical waste management branch of the state 
Department of Health Services, called the agreement "a good settlement for the 
state." 
</P>
<P>
 McGurk indicated that the fact that UCLA was a student- and 
taxpayers-supported institution figured in the monetary settlement. "I think it 
wakes them up. People could have argued that the amount could have been higher, 
but on the other hand the taxpayers would foot the bill, or the students," 
McGurk said. 
</P>
<P>
 McGurk said the state alleged that UCLA had violated the Medical Waste 
Management Act and other provisions of the state Health and Safety Code, but 
that the charges never got to a formal stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The state official said: "As far as we are concerned, the case is closed." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Environmental Protection Agency is known to still be investigating 
the matter, leading to the possibility of federal charges.

LAPD REORGANIZING HANDLING OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS; LAW ENFORCEMENT: 
CHIEF SAYS STEPS BEGAN BEFORE DISCLOSURE OF SWEEPING INVESTIGATION AT WEST LOS 
ANGELES STATION. NEW UNIT MAY BE FORMED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department, aggressively trying to demonstrate resolve 
on the issue of sexual harassment, is reorganizing its system for handling 
harassment complaints and may launch a department-wide audit to determine the 
full extent of the problem, LAPD leaders said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the coming weeks, Police Chief Willie L. Williams said he intends to 
propose creating a specialized group to handle sexual harassment issues as well 
as other complaints of bias or discrimination. LAPD critics have long 
complained that female officers feel uncomfortable reporting harassment to 
Internal Affairs or through other department channels, partly because they fear 
retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of things that we have already started," said Williams, who 
emphasized that the reorganization was under way before news reports last week 
disclosing the existence of a massive LAPD inquiry into allegations of sexual 
harassment at the West Los Angeles police station. "To change people's views, 
to change people's actions . . . takes more than six months or a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Commission President Gary Greenebaum applauded Williams' efforts to 
combat sexual harassment, crediting the chief with authorizing the audit of the 
West Los Angeles station and with aggressively attempting to reform the 
department's handling of handling harassment complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important aspect of this is what is done from the top," Greenebaum 
said. "There is no better way for him to signal that change is in the offing. 
Change is here; it's happening now." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Williams did not comment in detail about the West Los Angeles 
inquiry, he told members of the Police Commission that the department is "very 
concerned about backlash" against employees who cooperated in that inquiry. 
Williams said he advised senior LAPD officers last week when he learned that 
news reports were about to disclose details of the inquiry. Those officers 
raised the issue at roll calls in West Los Angeles, Williams added, in order to 
inform officers that their rights will be protected. 
</P>
<P>
 The West Los Angeles audit, which is nearly complete, involved interviews with 
more than 100 police officers. Sources say it found a number of instances of 
sexual harassment at the station and concluded that the environment there had 
become uncomfortable for many female officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their protestations of innocence, two veteran police officers have 
been transferred out of West Los Angeles. Administrative action against them 
and other officers who either harassed women or tolerated harassment by others 
is being considered, according to LAPD sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief's comments Tuesday came as leaders of several organizations called 
on the Police Department to reform its handling of sexual harassment 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Sobel, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, said she has six 
clients who either have filed lawsuits or are preparing to press legal action 
against the department on sexual harassment-related grounds. She said the 
department's historically slow response to such allegations "sends out the 
wrong type of message -- that if you drag these out long enough, you can get 
away with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sobel said complaints of sexual harassment abound within the LAPD. Female 
officers at the West Los Angeles station have filed a number of complaints in 
recent times, as have officers in other divisions, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Sobel credited Williams with moving the department in the right 
direction on sexual harassment, she warned that simply creating a unit to 
investigate complaints will not solve the problem. She said that if the unit is 
made up of officers from Internal Affairs, some women may not trust it, and 
added that any unit must be equipped with a timetable for investigating and 
resolving disputes so that they do not linger unresolved for months. 
</P>
<P>
 Penny Harrington, a leader of the Women's Advisory Council to the Police 
Commission, commended the LAPD for its inquiry at the West Los Angeles station 
and for its efforts to prevent officers who cooperated with that inquiry from 
being punished. But she said harassment remains widespread, and she urged the 
LAPD to expand its internal inquiry to include all 18 divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would hope that this would continue," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams would not commit to a timetable for launching such an inquiry, but 
said after the meeting that "we will be moving forward in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenebaum stopped short of endorsing a departmentwide audit, but said he 
would support new training techniques to drive home the need for special care 
on the issue of sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the department prepares to absorb large numbers of female officers, we 
have to make a commitment to the right kind of working environment," he said. 
"We need to do the training of everyone so that these problems no longer 
exist."

HUNTINGTON PARK OFFICER SETTLES RACE BIAS LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Jewish Huntington Park police detective who sued the city in 1992 for 
anti-Semitic harassment has settled the case for $355,000.  
</P>
<P>
 "Part of me is relieved that it's over with because it's a tremendous amount 
of strain," said Detective Alan Tavelman, who alleged that he was harassed 
during nine years on the force. He has been on disability for a knee injury 
since the suit was filed. "And part of me really wanted to go to trial to bring 
it to more people's attention as to what really took place." 
</P>
<P>
 Civil rights attorney Barry Litt called the case "among the worst I have 
seen."  
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's reminiscent to the type of things you'd see against African 
Americans in the South in the early 1960s -- blatantly racist statements," said 
Litt, of the Los Angeles law firm Litt & Marquez, which represented Tavelman 
with the American Civil Liberties Union as co-counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleged that incidents included a newspaper article about the 
Holocaust that had been left on Tavelman's desk and altered to read ". . . burn 
them all," references to a lampshade having been made from his grandfather's 
skin; pennies taped to his desk, locker and car, an apparent reference to the 
stereotype of Jews as penny-pinchers, and implicit threats of violence, such as 
bullets left on his desk and in his department mailbox. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park officials said the decision to settle was made to avoid 
incurring the cost of a trial. "We felt we had a defensible case," said City 
Atty. Steven N. Skolnik. 
</P>
<P>
 The city was willing to take the case to court but had been advised to settle 
by the Independent Cities Risk Management Authority, a collective that pools 
the resources of cities against liability. "The city doesn't retain the 
decision-making power by virtue of its participation in this collective," 
Skolnik said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $335,000 settlement covers emotional distress and attorneys' fees, Litt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tavelman kept a detailed journal documenting religious slurs and harassment by 
fellow officers during his time on the force. He filed a federal lawsuit when 
the harassment continued despite formal complaints filed within the department. 
</P>
<P>
 During eight days of deposition testimony, the veteran burglary detective 
testified that harassment began during his prehiring interview when he was 
asked whether he "wore a funny hat." 
</P>
<P>
 "The case causes heightened awareness of the issues and the city may have 
increased training in the wake of these allegations, but it has always taken 
very seriously this kind of harassment," Skolnik said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Capt. Daniel A. Leili, who was named in the lawsuit along with Chief 
Frank Sullivan, Sgt. Ronald Beason and former Chief Patrick M. Connolly, said 
that although the suit was likely to give the 60-officer department a bad name, 
changes on the force would be unnecessary because Tavelman's allegations were 
untrue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure the public may reflect on us negatively, but the officers here know 
very well what was going on with Mr. Tavelman, and as far as internal morale 
goes, I don't think it will affect us," Leili said.

POLICE FIND NO FUKUTO, CITY LINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to settle "a number of rumors" about a possible link between the Palos 
Verdes Estates Police Department and the masked gunman who killed two of its 
commanders, city officials said Tuesday that David J. Fukuto had never applied 
for a job nor been arrested in the small South Bay community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simply stated, there is no connection," said Redondo Beach Police Lt. Jeff 
Cameron, who is serving as a spokesman for the department. 
</P>
<P>
 After it was learned last week that Fukuto had been rejected by the Los 
Angeles Police Department in 1992, Cameron said there was speculation that a 
similar relationship with Palos Verdes Estates police might help explain the 
Valentine's Day attack that claimed the lives of Capt. Michael Tracy and Sgt. 
Thomas Vanderpool during a motivational seminar at the Torrance Holiday Inn. 
</P>
<P>
 But after combing employment and arrest records, he said, officials found no 
mention of the 32-year-old Fukuto, son of state Appellate Justice Morio L. 
Fukuto. "Both of those were dead-ends," Cameron told reporters gathered at 
Palos Verdes Estates City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same news conference, Police Chief Gary E. Johansen released a 
statement saying that his 23-officer department would return today to normal 
patrol duties, which have been shared for the last week by officers in 
neighboring Torrance and Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our officers have had time to grieve," Johansen said. "Now it is time for the 
department to respect our lost officers by returning to the work of protecting 
our citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Michael C. Moody added that he would ask the City Council to begin 
planning a community barbecue to thank everyone who has been "so gracious to us 
in our time of need." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he would seek funds to refurbish the Palos Verdes Estates 
veterans memorial -- originally built to honor those who died in World War II 
-- so that it reflects the city's most recent losses.

POLICE INVESTIGATE 3 STABBING DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles homicide detectives are investigating the stabbing deaths of three 
South-Central Los Angeles residents whose bodies were found in their converted 
garage apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies of Myrtle Vera Johnson, 49, Lacy Albert, 58, and John Sumpter, 67, 
were discovered Monday, but police and neighbors said the three probably were 
killed sometime over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were found by Johnson's brother, who stopped by the East 47th 
Street apartment because he had been unable to reach his sister, a nearby 
resident said. Police said they had yet to determine a motive for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people on the busy street said the apartment was a gathering place for 
neighborhood drinkers. The three had lived in the unit for several years.  
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor said she had seen Albert on Saturday and heard no unusual noises 
coming from the apartment since then. "There were always people dropping by 
there, but since Saturday no one has been there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbor said she went to the back-yard unit shortly after the discovery 
of the bodies. The apartment was cluttered but there were no signs of a 
struggle, she said, and a pot of food had been left cooking on the stove. The 
bodies were in the kitchen and living room.

STATE EXPECTS TO WIN DELAY ON QUAKE TAB; RECOVERY: MOVE BY CLINTON 
ADMINISTRATION WOULD ALLOW CALIFORNIA EXTRA TIME TO PAY ITS $334-MILLION SHARE 
OF AID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to requests by California officials, President Clinton is expected 
to announce today that the Administration will allow the hard-pressed state 
government to delay payment of the $334 million it is required to contribute to 
$9.5 billion in federal earthquake aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision will give California flexibility in repaying its matching funds. 
Without this action, the state would be required to begin contributing to the 
emergency aid shortly -- posing an additional burden as lawmakers struggle to 
close a projected deficit and produce a balanced budget for the 1995 fiscal 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration plans to allow the state to borrow the funds from private 
lenders. The federal government would then guarantee the loans against future 
state Community Development Block Grants. Terms of repayment would depend on 
these agreements but might entail a longer period than the four-plus years 
requested by Gov. Pete Wilson and legislative leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is purely a cash-flow problem," said a senior Administration official. 
"They're in the middle of a budget. The state and (local governments) are 
strapped for cash. This is not something that increases the cost to the federal 
taxpayer." 
</P>
<P>
 The money is California's share of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's 
public assistance and individual and family grants programs. Overall, the state 
plans to provide $1.9 billion to help the quake-damaged Los Angeles region 
recover and rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA's public assistance program pays for repairs and reconstruction of 
schools, colleges, sewers, power plants, hospitals, and state and municipal 
facilities. The federal government contributes 90% of these costs; the state, 
10%. The state projects its share to be $164 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual and family grants of up to $12,200 are available to cover medical 
and transportation costs, home repairs and other immediate needs. The federal 
government provides 75% of these costs; the state, 25%. The state projects its 
cost at $170 million. 
</P>
<P>
 A third FEMA program that provides individual assistance, including temporary 
housing, crisis counseling and disaster unemployment aid, is financed entirely 
by the federal government. Congress allocated $4.7 billion for FEMA aid for 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the federal agency pays 100% of all costs in the first three days 
after a federal disaster. Clinton extended the cost-sharing waiver for an 
additional five days after the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA has received more than 360,000 applications for assistance in the wake of 
the Jan. 17 Northridge quake. The $344 million is an estimate of the state's 
eventual share of the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government recently approved an $8.6-billion earthquake aid 
package. Another $900 million in contingency funds already has been committed. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to defray the immediate cost to California, Wilson sent a letter to 
Clinton requesting a loan of $334 million and asking that the state be allowed 
to repay it over a three-year period, beginning July 1, 1995. Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) and Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer 
(D-Hayward) made the same request. 
</P>
<P>
 California lawmakers inserted language into the massive emergency spending 
bill that urged the federal government to "make every effort to provide the 
highest degree of financial flexibility to minimize the fiscal impact to the 
state."DISASTER RELIEF

CAL-MORTGAGE OFFICER TELLS OF SILENCING ON TRIAD LOAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE WIELAWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kathleen Staub, project officer on a controversial Cal-Mortgage loan guarantee 
to Triad Healthcare Inc., testified on Tuesday that she was ordered to omit her 
objections to the deal from her oral report to Cal-Mortgage's advisory loan 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Staub, testifying before the Assembly Health Committee investigating the Triad 
transaction, said the order was given by Larry G. Meeks, then director of 
Cal-Mortgage's parent agency, the Office of Statewide Health Planning and 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeks, she said, angrily rejected her opinion that the Triad deal was unsound 
and told her that he considered it an "excellent project," Staub told the 
committee. He then ordered her to omit her recommendation that Triad's 
application be turned down from her presentation to the loan committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning by committee Chairman Burt Margolin, (D-Los Angeles), Staub 
said she never before had been asked to censor her report in 10 years as a 
Cal-Mortgage project officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Encino-based Triad got the loan guarantee and has since defaulted, leaving 
the program -- and potentially state taxpayers -- on the hook for the 
$167-million debt. Earlier this month, Triad, owner of two San Fernando Valley 
hospitals, filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolin convened Tuesday's hearing to investigate the Triad loan guarantee, 
the largest ever granted by the 25-year-old Cal-Mortgage program. Triad's 
default last July forced state officials to suspend the program. Many 
health-care facilities rely on Cal-Mortgage to obtain low-interest loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I can best describe it is a debacle, a total mess," Margolin said of 
the Triad deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeks was invited to testify Tuesday but did not appear before the committee. 
He could not be reached for comment after the hearing. But Margolin later 
announced that he would call another hearing on Triad, and that Meeks was 
expected to testify at that one. No date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
 Triad owns Sherman Oaks Hospital and Health Center in Sherman Oaks and West 
Valley Hospital and Health Center in Canoga Park.

IMMIGRANT STUDY CITES FISCAL GAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rather than being a drain on the economy, immigrants in California contribute 
$12 billion more each year in taxes and other payments than than they cost in 
schooling, health care and other services, a new analysis has found. 
</P>
<P>
 "Immigration is on balance a plus," said Jeffrey S. Passel, director of 
immigration research at the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank, who 
unveiled his findings Tuesday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 His analysis is the latest broadside in the war of dueling studies -- often 
with diametrically opposite conclusions -- that has punctuated the emotionally 
charged immigration debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Principally, Passel attacked the methodology of Donald L. Huddle, a Rice 
University economist whose work has often been cited in California and 
nationwide as evidence that immigrants deflate federal, state and local 
economies. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, widely disseminated Huddle studies reported that immigrants take 
tens of thousands of jobs from U.S. workers and cost California taxpayers more 
than $18 billion annually. However, Passel disputed evidence of job 
displacement and concluded that immigrants provide a net benefit of $12 billon 
to the state, once government costs were subtracted from taxes and other 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
 On a national level, Passel contended that immigrants contributed $28.7 
billion more in taxes than they used in services -- compared to Huddle's 
findings that immigrants cost the nation a net $42.5 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, Passel charged that Huddle underestimated immigrant tax 
payments, exaggerated the size of foreign-born populations, both documented and 
undocumented, and overstated school enrollments (education is a major cost for 
immigrants). 
</P>
<P>
 "His (Huddle's) numbers don't make sense." said Passel, whose counter-study 
(costing $10,000) was financed by the Tomas Rivera Center, a Claremont-based 
Latino policy study institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Huddle's analysis, Passel's report did not specifically focus on illegal 
immigrants -- the lightning rod in the debate -- but looked at all foreign 
settlers who entered the country since 1970. Passel calls about one-fifth of 
that population undocumented; Huddle says more than a third are illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached at his Houston home Tuesday, Huddle defended his conclusions. "They're 
grasping at straws," Huddle said of his critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of Huddle say immigrant advocates have targeted the Houston 
professor's research to blunt discussion of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to justify a large-scale immigration program," said Dan Stein, 
executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which 
seeks restrictions on entries. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other experts, Passel finds that a disproportionate amount of immigrant 
tax funds accrue to Washington rather than to state and local governments. 
Huddle maintains that all levels of government lose out. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other alleged flaws, Passel stated that Huddle's reports: 
</P>
<P>
 * Factor in a population of 4.8 million undocumented immigrants -- 50% more 
than the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service's estimate of 3.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ignore Social Security payments and other tax revenues generated by 
immigrants, while excluding benefits arising from newcomers' spending. 
</P>
<P>
 * Inflate immigrant participation in a range of benefit programs, including 
welfare, food stamps, job training and health services.

INDEPENDENT STUDY URGED OF HEALTH RISKS FROM GAS IN SUBWAY; RED LINE: MTA 
COMMISSIONER WANTS DOCTORS TO LOOK AT FOUL-SMELLING FUMES IN TUNNEL. REPORTS 
SHOW THAT LEVELS CAN BE HIGH ENOUGH TO CAUSE HEADACHES, NAUSEA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The potential health risks posed by a sulfur-smelling gas that is causing 
complaints from passengers and train operators in the Downtown Los Angeles 
subway should be examined by physicians who are independent of the project, a 
transit commissioner said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to suggest getting some independent physicians to study this," said 
Nick Patsaouras, an engineer who serves on the board of the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority. Patsaouras said he will make his recommendation today 
at an MTA board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation comes as state and county health officials opened a review 
of the problem. Based on gas readings collected by the MTA and on interviews, 
The Times reported Saturday that volumes of the substance, hydrogen sulfide, 
typically reach levels that public health officials say can cause headaches, 
nausea or malaise. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians with the California Environmental Protection Agency and the Los 
Angeles County Health Department said Tuesday they would jointly examine the 
problem. An MTA spokesman said the agency was notified Tuesday that health 
authorities are investigating. 
</P>
<P>
 The transit authority will "cooperate with them and provide whatever 
documentation they need," said Rick Jager, an MTA spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. James W. Stratton, a chief deputy director of the state EPA, said he will 
lead the probe, along with Dr. Paul J. Papanek of the county health 
department's toxics epidemiology unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will . . . be rendering some opinion of what we think of it" and 
recommending possible corrective action, Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA is expected to release the findings today of a separate panel that the 
agency appointed to examine the structural soundness and durability of the 
subway's concrete tunnel walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Soil studies published in advance of the subway construction noted the 
existence Downtown of hydrogen sulfide, a gas common in areas of former oil 
exploration. According to the MTA, levels of hydrogen sulfide typically reach 
concentrations in the subway tunnels and stations of 5 to 8 parts per million. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Federal health standards warn that respiratory or nervous system problems can 
result after 10 minutes or more exposure to hydrogen sulfide at concentrations 
of 10 parts per million or greater. The gas can be lethal at 300 parts per 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians contacted Tuesday said that studies over the past five years appear 
to counter previous assumptions that exposure to hydrogen sulfide at lower 
levels poses little cumulative health risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Kaye H. Kilburn, a professor at USC School of Medicine who is studying the 
impact on oil refinery workers and residents of trace levels of hydrogen 
sulfide, said concentrations of 5 p.p.m. to 8 p.p.m. are cause for alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth of the matter is that it's a serious problem," Kilburn said. She 
added that even at 2 p.p.m., "it's a thousand times too high to be safe. It 
kind of makes me quiver." 
</P>
<P>
 Herbert Venable, a biologist with the National Institute of Occupational 
Safety and Health, said he believes the MTA should immediately install sensors 
at the lowest elevations of the subway structures to get the most accurate 
readings possible. Although hydrogen sulfide is heavier than air, the MTA now 
relies on sensors that are at the tops of the tunnels and stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to get a real handle on what you've got, you've got to get real 
low," Venable said. "I don't want to raise concerns unnecessarily, but the 
nature of hydrogen sulfide is to be fairly sneaky." 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, MTA officials announced that they would delay construction of 
a 2.3-mile Red Line extension because of concerns about hydrogen sulfide 
concentrations in the general area of Olympic and Crenshaw boulevards.

CAL STATE FULLERTON KEEPS FOOTBALL ON THE SIDELINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The helmets and shoulder pads in the Cal State Fullerton equipment room will 
continue to collect cobwebs for at least another year, because there will be no 
Titan football next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Current budget planning in the CSU system calls for additional reductions in 
state funding for 1994-95," Milton Gordon, school president, said in a release 
issued Tuesday. "It would be unrealistic to bring football back under these 
conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 The release merely made official what everyone in the Titan athletic 
department had suspected for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Though revenue from a new student athletics fee will begin pumping an 
additional $500,000 a year into the department next fall, the school had done 
virtually nothing -- mainly, hire a coach and recruit players this winter -- to 
indicate it would field a team for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 But what about 1995 and beyond? 
</P>
<P>
 Previous athletic department studies projected the price of Division I-AA, 
cost-containment football to be about $500,000 a year, and there would be a 
home for the Titans in the I-AA American West Conference, which was formed in 
1993 and consists of Cal State Northridge, Sacramento State, Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo, Southern Utah and UC Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 But football would use all of the additional student funds, which otherwise 
would be used to strengthen existing programs, including the highly successful 
baseball, softball and soccer teams, which have been hit hard by budget cuts in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also the gender equity issue, which presents a bigger roadblock for 
football than money. Without football, Fullerton is practically in compliance 
with federal and state gender equity laws -- that is, roughly 53% of the 
student-athletes on campus are men and 47% are women. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of football, even with a minimum roster in the 50- to 60-player 
range, without an equal boost in women's athletes, probably would put Fullerton 
in violation of a court order to achieve gender equity within five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are just too many things to consider (before making a decision about 
1995)," Gordon said in an interview. "We're going to take it a year at a time. 
Other sports have suffered and we want to improve those. There are a lot of 
factors, but the main thing I'm looking for is a stable budget." 
</P>

 Fullerton began playing football in 1970 at the College Division level, moved

RADINSKY RETURNS FOR CHEMOTHERAPY; BASEBALL: WHITE SOX PITCHER AT HOME IN SIMI 
VALLEY FOLLOWING SURGERY TO REMOVE MALIGNANT LYMPH NODE FROM HIS NECK.

<P>
 Chicago White Sox reliever Scott Radinsky, a former star at Simi Valley High, 
had a malignant lymph node removed from his neck and likely will miss the 
season while undergoing treatment to prevent the spread of Hodgkin's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Radinsky, 25, has returned to his home in Simi Valley to begin chemotherapy 
and radiation treatments that could last six to eight months. White Sox general 
manager Ron Schueler said Tuesday there is an outside chance Radinsky could 
pitch this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodgkin's disease is a chronic disease caused by the enlargement of lymph 
nodes and other lymph tissues. NHL star Mario Lemieux, NFL lineman Karl Nelson 
and Olympic wrestler Jeff Blatnick are among other athletes who have been 
afflicted with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's curable but you never know when you deal with chemo and radiation," said 
Schueler, whose wife died from leukemia in 1991. "There are a lot more severe 
ones than the one he has. But it's still cancer. I saw it with my wife when she 
was having chemo and radiation. It's not a lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cure rate on this type of cancer is 80 to 90%. The doctors are real 
optimistic. They think he will be fine and even to the point that he'll be 
weakened by all this treatment, but at times will be able to do a little 
physical therapy to keep his muscle structure up." 
</P>
<P>
 Radinsky underwent tests after complaining of discomfort on the left side of 
his neck. The surgery was performed Monday by oncologists at Sarasota Memorial 
Hospital. X-rays revealed no spread of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Radinsky, a four-year veteran, appeared in 78 games last season with an 8-2 
record and a 4.28 earned-run average. He was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Radinsky is married to the sister of shortstop Ozzie Guillen's wife. Guillen 
said Tuesday that Radinsky visited him in December and was complaining of 
discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's trying to be upbeat," Schueler said after talking with Radinsky. "He's a 
little nervous and concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Herm Schneider said immediate treatment is imperative. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sooner he gets going on it, the better it is for his health, for his 
life," Schueler said. "He's got the best of a bad situation but it's still a 
bad situation." 
</P>
<P>
 As comfortable on the mound as he was at a drum set in a rock band, the 
hard-throwing, free-spirited left-hander dominated hitters when he pitched for 
Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, he led the Pioneers (26-4) to the semifinals of the Southern Section 
4-A Division playoffs. Radinsky was 14-1 with a 1.18 ERA as a senior, striking 
out 180 batters in 100 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Schueler has encouraged Radinsky to visit the team when the White Sox come to 
the West Coast.

HAZELTON LOOKS TO CHALLENGE OF BURBANK JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Montclair Prep coach John Hazelton accepted the head-coaching job at 
Burbank High Tuesday, six days after the Burbank school board offered it to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazelton, 42, took the position without a guarantee of a teaching job in the 
Burbank School District but said he is looking forward to the challenge of 
turning around the fortunes of a team that finished 2-8 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure we can establish a program that the school and the community is 
proud of and the kids are happy to compete in," said Hazelton, who won't 
guarantee instant success for a community hungry for victories.  
</P>
<P>
 He pointed to the 1994 schedule, which includes seven tough opponents -- 
Crescenta Valley, Quartz Hill, Verbum Dei, Glendale, Hart, Canyon and Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the little guys in town -- and I haven't been that for a while," 
Hazelton said. "But they're not losers over there in Burbank. They're 
enthusiastic and ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Hazelton was co-head coach at Montclair Prep from 1982-83, head coach from 
1984-85 and a Mountie assistant the past five seasons. Over the 1984-85 
seasons, his teams went 19-7 and produced one Southern Section championship.  
</P>
<P>
 He was also a volunteer assistant at USC in 1986, head coach at Banning in 
1987 and defensive coordinator at Valley College in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't have a job teaching here," Burbank vice-principal Jim Perske said. 
"We hope he will this fall. That makes it difficult for John. That's a major 
sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
 Hazelton and his assistants, Jim Clausen, John Greaves and Les Himes, will 
work as volunteers this semester, beginning today with a team meeting and the 
first conditioning session.

WILL 'SNOW WHITE' DWARF OTHERS?; HOME ENTERTAINMENT: REVERSING POLICY, DISNEY 
WILL ALLOW THE ANIMATED FILM TO GO ON SALE. THE COMPANY PLANS A NEW RIDE AT 
DISNEYLAND, BUT IT DIDN'T ELABORATE ON PROPOSED O.C. RESORT. 
</P>

<P>
 Walt Disney Co., which once vowed it would never release its classic film 
"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" on home video, said Tuesday it will do just 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney made the "Snow White" announcement at its annual shareholders' meeting 
at Disney World in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting, Disney officials said 1994 is shaping up as an "even better 
year" than 1993. The company did not quarrel with analyst estimates that Disney 
will earn more than $2 per share this year, compared to $1.63 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Little new information was offered at the meeting, however, about the 
company's operations in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the company added no elaboration on its plans for a $3-billion 
resort at Disneyland, centered on a Westcot theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 In prepared remarks to stockholders, President Frank Wells noted that Westcot 
is one of three major development projects being considered. The other two are 
Disney's America, a historically themed park outside Washington, and a new 
ocean-oriented theme park slated for Tokyo Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether we are able to build one, or all, of these three planned parks 
depends on economic and political factors which are not all under our control," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 About Disneyland itself, Wells simply said that the park has been prospering 
on the strength of its new Mickey's Toontown children's area and plans a major 
new ride based on the Indiana Jones trilogy of movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney said it will release the animated feature -- the last video holdout in 
its library -- for a limited period this fall, in time for the holiday shopping 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives of the Burbank firm maintained in the past that they would not 
release "Snow White" in home video for fear such a move would jeopardize the 
value of the film in theatrical exhibition. Disney has released "Snow White" 
nine times since it premiered in 1937, taking in an estimated $700 million at 
the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have found over the last 10 years is that the value of these movies 
has not at all been diminished by their release into home video," said Jeffrey 
Katzenberg, president of Walt Disney Studios. "It's frankly taken a long time 
where we feel comfortable taking out the crown jewel." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last several years, Disney has recycled films such as "Pinocchio" 
through the theatrical and home video markets without apparent detriment. 
"Pinocchio" was first released on home video in 1985, subsequently re-released 
in the movie theaters a couple of years later and currently is available on 
home video until April. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite clear from testing the waters with 'Aladdin,' 'Beauty and the 
Beast' and 'Pinocchio' that this kind of release can unleash tremendous profits 
for them," said Harold Vogel, an entertainment analyst at Merrill Lynch. 
"There's no reason to sit on it." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Vogel also suggested that among the factors motivating Disney to 
release "Snow White" now for home viewing are the financial problems of its 
Euro Disney theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 "That situation is not pleasant for them to go through, and this may be one 
way of offsetting any future problems in reinvesting in Euro Disney," Vogel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney also announced that it had reached an agreement with Olympic figure 
skater Nancy Kerrigan to produce a TV movie based on her life and an ice 
skating special in which she will star.

HUGHES AIRCRAFT WINS CONTRACT TO UPGRADE NORWEGIAN AIR DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hughes Aircraft Co. said Tuesday that it had won a $106-million contract to 
upgrade air defense systems for the Royal Norwegian Air Force. Dan Reeder, 
spokesman for Hughes, said the aerospace company's Surface Systems unit in 
Fullerton will be the prime contractor on the project, which is a joint venture 
of Hughes and a Norwegian company, Norsk Forsvarsteknologi. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the contract will not result in new hiring at Hughes. The company has 
9,000 employees in Orange County, including 7,000 at the Hughes Fullerton 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the contract, the partners will convert Norway's existing surface-to-air 
missiles -- which knock hostile aircraft out of the sky -- to a new missile 
system created by Hughes and the Norwegian firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The new system uses ground-launched advanced medium-range air-to-air missiles 
instead of the older-generation adapted Hawk missiles. Norway is expected to 
buy several hundred of the ground-launched missiles for the system under a 
separate procurement deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a system will save on costs because Norway will be able to use the new 
missiles for both its ground-based air defense system and for its fleet of F-16 
fighter jets. 
</P>
<P>
 Options for future contract extensions could be worth $25 million, Reeder 
said.

 Bond Report: In the wake of the legal proceedings at Baldwin, Amin Arjomand, a 
distressed real estate analyst with Dabney Resnick Inc. in Beverly Hills, a 
securities firm that specializes in junk bonds, is preparing a report for its 
clients on the quality of the $155-million bonds that Baldwin sold. 
</P>
<P>
 He has found the company is more leveraged than other regional home builders, 
and said that at current trading levels the Baldwin notes are trading at higher 
levels than might be expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "There appears to be a significant downside risk for new buyers," he said in 
the report. "In addition, on a qualitative basis, the loss of key senior 
management, current legal proceedings and potential conflicts of interest at 
the affiliate level, pose hidden risks to current bondholders."

PARTNERSHIPS IN OSTRICH RANCH HALTED; INVESTMENTS: THE DEPARTMENT OF 
CORPORATIONS HAS DETERMINED THAT SALES OF $12,500 SHARES IN A FULLERTON 
RANCHING OPERATION CONSTITUTE AN ILLEGAL SECURITIES OFFERING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A fledgling investment venture in ostrich ranching was scratched Tuesday when 
its owners were served with a state order to halt the sale of limited 
partnerships in an Orange County ostrich ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 North American Ostrich Group of Fullerton and its owners, Alex Wilson and 
Dennis Campbell, were ordered to cease selling the $12,500 partnership shares 
because the state Department of Corporations determined that the deal 
constituted an illegal securities offering. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said he and Wilson have sold a number of partnerships since starting 
their company a year ago, but declined further comment. "Our attorney put the 
(offering) together," he said, "and I really won't have anything to say until I 
can reach him." He declined to identify the attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview earlier this month, Campbell said he and Wilson had raised 
$60,000 from investors and had purchased six of the giant, flightless birds to 
start Orange County's only ostrich ranch on a quarter-acre lot next to 
Campbell's residence in the rural Sunny Hills area of Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not clear Tuesday what impact, if any, the state order barring 
investment sales will have on the actual ranch operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey Kozberg, a spokeswoman for the Department of Corporations, said Wilson 
and Campbell failed to register the limited partnership offering with the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Printed offering materials, she said, promised investors returns of 200% to 
300%. North American Ostrich Group was seeking to raise $250,000 and said it 
would use the funds to purchase breeding pairs of ostriches, at $20,000 a pair, 
for Campbell's ranch. Profits to investors would come from the sale of the 
ostrich chicks to other ranches and, ultimately, from the sale of ostrich meat 
and byproducts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ostrich ranching has been a popular investment program for several years. One 
Texas ranch operator has had a display at the Orange County Fair for several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers promote the birds as a source of low-fat, low-cholesterol meat, fancy 
feathers and exotic leather and contend that an investment in breeding pairs of 
ostriches potentially can be a real moneymaker if ostrich meat ever catches the 
public's fancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, there are about 200 ostrich ranches in California, and while 
Campbell's may be the only one in Orange County, it is far from the first. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton, Anaheim and La Habra all were home to large ostrich ranches in the 
late 1880s, when the birds' feathers were prized as plumage for women's hats. 
</P>
<P>
 Those early ranches, however, all have given way to real estate development, 
which has proved to be a much bigger investment vehicle in Orange County over 
the years.

AST TO MAKE COMPUTER LINE TO BE SOLD UNDER DELL NAME; HIGH TECHNOLOGY: THE DEAL 
BETWEEN THE RIVALS, RUMORED FOR MONTHS, FOCUSES ON PORTABLES, THE 
FASTEST-GROWING PART OF THE MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Dell Computer Corp. confirmed Tuesday that rival computer maker AST Research 
Inc. will manufacture a line of portable computers to be sold under Dell's 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal between the two companies was rumored for months. Lisa Rohlf, 
spokeswoman for Dell in Austin, Tex., said the company began shipping the new 
AST-made portable computers Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that Irvine-based AST is making the Dell Latitude computers in its 
Taiwan factory, and that Dell will complete final assembly of the computers and 
add software at its plants in Austin and Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial and technical fiascoes forced Dell to cancel its portable computer 
line last year and write off $20 million in development costs. The company 
stopped selling such computers in August. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dell officials have said they can't afford to stay out of the market for 
notebook computers -- those that weigh less than eight pounds and fit in a 
briefcase -- since it is the fastest growing part of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Antoine J. Tristani, analyst at South Coast Capital investment bank in Austin, 
estimated that Dell could sell 5,000 of the computers during the current fiscal 
quarter, with volumes increasing in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will definitely enhance volume production and lower manufacturing costs 
for AST," he said. "It's a smart deal for both AST and Dell. They look like 
they hit the sweet spot of the notebook market." 
</P>
<P>
 AST took its Bravo notebook computer line and enhanced it to come up with the 
model that will be marketed by Dell. Rohlf said the companies will not compete 
directly since Dell primarily sells its computers direct to consumers while AST 
focuses on various industry dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dell machines range in price from $1,700 to $3,250. 
</P>
<P>
 Dell plans to re-enter the portable computer market gradually in three phases. 
Future models, and possibly future manufacturing partnerships, already are in 
the works, Rohlf said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dell is reportedly working with Sony Corp. for its second-phase notebook 
computers, which will be out later this year. Dell's stock rose $1.75 a share 
to close at $22.75 in Nasdaq trading Tuesday, while AST's stock rose $1 a share 
to $32.25.

SNEAKER MAKER VANS INC. SAYS IT EXPECTS ANOTHER 3RD-QUARTER LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Vans Inc., which makes fashionable canvas sneakers, said Tuesday it would have 
another losing third quarter this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it expects what it called a "modest" loss -- probably between 
3 cents and 9 cents a share -- for the quarter, which ends Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be an improvement over the same quarter last year, however, when 
the company lost $2.4 million, equal to 25 cents a share, on sales of $18 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also said that its board had adopted a "poison pill" strategy to 
prevent hostile takeovers, although a spokesman said the company isn't in 
imminent danger of a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock, however, is trading at what Vans said it believes to be a 
relatively low price. Before the company released its announcement late Tuesday 
afternoon, the stock closed unchanged at $5.875 on Nasdaq. The poison pill, 
Vans said, is merely a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vans is in the process of changing itself around," said Dale Appell, a vice 
president at Torrey Pines Securities, a San Diego brokerage, "and there could 
be significantly higher earnings in its future. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the levels the stock is trading at, it appears quite inexpensive." 
</P>
<P>
 The poison pill calls for the company to issue new stock to shareholders at a 
discount if a hostile bidder acquires 15% of Vans. That would make it 
prohibitively expensive to buy the rest of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Vans also said that the Teamsters had asked the National Labor Relations Board 
for a union election at the company's plant in Orange. The union said it 
estimates that there are 1,500 workers eligible to vote in the election. The 
company on Tuesday said that estimate was high. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not believe that a union is in the best interests of our employees or 
the company," said Walter E. Schoenfeld, president and chief executive. "We 
intend to mount a vigorous campaign against it."

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: U.S.-RUSSIAN PACT WILL HELP DISTRIBUTION, ICN SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. said Tuesday that an agreement between the United 
States and Russia will help its business. 
</P>
<P>
 ICN drugs already are sold in Russia, such as Virazole, which is used to treat 
infants hospitalized with respiratory infections.But the agreement will mean 
wider distribution for its products, the Costa Mesa drug-maker said in a news 
release. 
</P>
<P>
 The two countries agreed last week that any American drug already approved by 
the federal Food and Drug Administration will be approved in Russia within 90 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 An ICN spokesman also said construction should start "in the near future" on a 
$40-million drug factory the company is building in St. Petersburg in 
partnership with a Russian drug-maker. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineering plans are being drawn up now and a site has been found. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian company, Oktyabr, is the oldest and one of the largest drug 
companies in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 ICN acquired 75% of Oktyabr last year in return for agreeing to supply the $40 
million to build the factory, where both companies' drugs will be manufactured. 
ICN said it has not yet got financing for construction, but is talking to 
lenders now.

BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE; EX-BALDWIN OFFICIAL FILES ARBITRATION ACTION AGAINST 
FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Another former top executive of Baldwin Builders has begun legal wranglings 
with the beleaguered Newport Beach home builder. Former Orange County division 
President Geoff Fearns, who resigned from the company in November, has filed an 
arbitration action against Baldwin.The action accuses the company's owners of 
breach of contract, forced resignation and fraud. Fearns is seeking mediation 
through Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, a statewide organization 
headquartered in Orange, because of a provision in his former contract 
requiring certain disputes to be arbitrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin officials did not return phone calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 His action comes on the heels of a lawsuit filed by Robert B. Burns, formerly 
a corporate vice president and head of Baldwin's Los Angeles-Ventura division. 
Burns' suit, filed Jan. 25 in Los Angeles Superior Court, is seeking at least 
$35 million in damages for fraud and breach of contract from the company and 
its owners, James and Alfred Baldwin. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns and Fearns are two of three division presidents who have left the 
company in the last two months. The third, San Diego division President Greg 
Smith, was terminated, according to Burns' suit. The suit alleges the Baldwins 
attempted to engage Fearns and Smith in a scheme to avoid federal income tax 
payments in 1993, and intentionally failed to disclose Burns' partnership 
agreement to investors when the company sold $155 million in bonds last year.

 Regency Health Services Inc.: The company said Tuesday that Andrew E. Senyei 
has resigned from its board of directors in advance of the company's pending 
merger with Tustin-based Care Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Senyei, a physician and general partner in a Newport Beach venture capital

second fiscal quarter, contrasted with a profit of $27,901, or 1 cent a share, 
for the comparable period last year. Revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 31 
declined 14%, to $913,385 from $1.1 million.For the first six months, the 
company reported a net loss of $278,900, or 10 cents a share, on revenue of 
$1.8 million. That compares with a profit of $49,786, or 2 cents a share, on 
revenue of $2.1 million for the six months ended Dec. 31, 1992. The company 
attributed the decline in revenue and earnings primarily to the low level of 
orders from its distributor.

FETUSES FOUND AFFECTED BY SECONDHAND SMOKE; TOBACCO: DOCTORS SAY NEWBORNS OF 
NONSMOKERS HAVE TOXIC EFFECTS IN HAIR. STUDY OPENS NEW RESEARCH PATHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In research that provides the first biochemical proof that secondhand 
cigarette smoke affects unborn children, doctors in Toronto have shown that 
tobacco's toxic elements accumulate in the fetuses of pregnant women who do not 
smoke but who live or work closely with smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 The study confirms long-held suspicions that being in the womb does not 
protect fetuses from exposure to secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, experts say the new methods used by the researchers will help 
scientists answer crucial questions about whether passive smoke increases a 
baby's risk of low birth weight, prematurity, slow neurological development and 
sudden infant death syndrome, all of which have been linked to smoking during 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 By measuring levels of nicotine and cotinine -- a long-lasting byproduct of 
nicotine -- in the hair of newborns, the study found that levels of cotinine 
were twice as high in infants of so-called passive smokers than in those born 
to nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
 One baby was exposed to so much secondhand smoke that the researchers found it 
was as if the mother had smoked five cigarettes a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message (to pregnant women) is: "It's not enough for you not to smoke," 
said Dr. Gideon Koren, the study's lead author. "You should try to convince 
your husband, common-law or fellow worker not to smoke, or insist that they not 
smoke, because their smoke gets into the baby." 
</P>
<P>
 The research was published today in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
in an issue devoted exclusively to the health effects of tobacco, and was 
presented Tuesday in New York during a daylong AMA briefing. The AMA has taken 
strong political stands against smoking, and the coordinated media push drew 
the anger of the Tobacco Institute, a trade industry group. 
</P>
<P>
 In other news, the journal reported: 
</P>
<P>
 * The decline in smoking rates in the United States during the past 25 years 
appears to have stalled, even though nationwide efforts to control tobacco are 
being hailed as a public health success story. A study conducted by the U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control found that in 1991, an estimated 25.7% of the U.S. 
population smoked -- slightly higher than the previous year's estimate of 
25.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sales of single cigarettes are booming. Researchers at Cal State San 
Bernardino found that half of all California convenience stores surveyed sold 
single cigarettes -- often to minors in minority neighborhoods -- even though 
it is against the law to sell cigarettes to children under 18, and illegal to 
sell them if they are not properly packaged, with warning labels. The 
researchers say such sales encourage young people to smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cigarette advertising has resulted in a major increase in smoking by 
adolescent girls. A 44-year study showed that from the end of World War II 
through 1967, smoking rates in adolescent girls climbed slowly and steadily. 
But the rates shot up in the late 1960s, after aggressive advertising campaigns 
targeting young women, such as the early Virginia Slims campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The advertising study, conducted at the UC San Diego Cancer Center, is an 
extension of research showing that the Joe Camel cartoon character used to 
advertise Camel cigarettes was widely recognized by children. Its lead author, 
cancer epidemiologist John P. Pierce, urged federal regulators to curb certain 
images in cigarette ads. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no public health action against tobacco marketing after evidence 
that Joe Camel impacted young people because the tobacco industry demanded 
evidence linking advertising to . . . smoking in minors," Pierce said. "This 
study provides such evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Brennan Dawson, a spokeswoman for the Tobacco Institute, attributed 
the surge to the women's liberation movement. "Advertising follows social 
change," she said. "It doesn't lead it." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the research on secondhand smoke in fetuses, Dawson said the study 
provides no evidence that there are long-term dangers for infants exposed to 
secondhand smoke. But other studies suggest that there are such dangers and 
experts say that, employing the methods used by the Toronto researchers, it 
will not be long before scientists can answer those questions more 
definitively. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children took their 
measurements by snipping five or six strands of hair from infants one to three 
days after birth. Other studies have measured nicotine and cotinine in blood 
and urine. 
</P>
<P>
 But most mothers do not smoke in the hours right before giving birth, and by 
the time their babies are born the tobacco byproducts have been expunged from 
their bodies. The use of hair allows researchers to date the infant's exposure 
to smoke and to determine more precisely the extent of that exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, there were such poor measures of exposure that you couldn't easily 
divide children by degree," said Dr. Jonathan E. Fielding, a UCLA professor of 
public health and pediatrics. "Now, we will be able to say, look, if a kid had 
a high level of cotinine at birth, does that correlates with a higher 
likelihood of slower development? I think that is very, very important." 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety-four pregnant women participated in the study -- 36 women who smoked 
between one and 40 cigarettes a day, 35 nonsmokers, and 23 so-called "passive 
smokers," who either lived or worked with someone who smokes frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers looked closely at measures of cotinine, because cotinine 
remains in the body much longer than nicotine and because it is a good 
indicator of the presence of carbon monoxide -- one of the most toxic 
byproducts of tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 For infants of smokers, levels of cotinine were about 10 times higher than 
infants of nonsmokers. Babies born to passive smokers showed one-fourth to 
one-fifth as much cotinine as the smokers. Because nicotine occurs naturally in 
some foods, including tomatoes, eggplant and potatoes, even nonsmokers and 
their infants showed a certain amount of it.

TEEN-AGER KILLS FATHER, OFFICER AND HIMSELF; VIOLENCE: ROOKIE CHRISTY LYNNE 
HAMILTON IS SECOND PATROLWOMAN TO BE KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY. DOMESTIC 
ARGUMENT OVER LOUD MUSIC LED TO THE SHOOTINGS. 
</P>

<P>
 A rookie Los Angeles police officer was fatally shot early Tuesday outside a 
Northridge home by a 17-year-old youth who had killed his father in a dispute 
over loud music, investigators said. The boy later apparently shot himself to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Christy Lynne Hamilton, 45, who graduated from the Police Academy on 
Friday, died after she was shot once in the chest with an AR-15 military-style 
semiautomatic rifle as she and other officers responded to a report of gunfire 
at an Amestoy Avenue home. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Steven R. Golly, a Vietnam veteran and gun collector, was gunned 
down by his son, Christopher, after the pair argued over turning down the 
youth's stereo. When police arrived, Chris opened fire on them from his front 
lawn, hitting Hamilton, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth retreated into the house, and several shots were heard. SWAT 
officers stormed the house after trying for several hours to telephone the 
youth. Inside, both Gollys were found dead, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton, a mother of two, was the second female Los Angeles police officer to 
die in the line of duty, and the ninth officer to be killed in the Los Angeles 
area in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon her Police Academy graduation, Hamilton had received an award honoring 
Tina Kerbrat, the other LAPD female officer who was killed in the line of duty. 
Kerbrat, also a rookie, was killed three years ago when she and another officer 
tried to question two men drinking beer on a Sun Valley sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends described Chris as a bright but troubled youth who was a daily abuser 
of methamphetamine, or speed. He was recently kicked out of a continuation 
school after being thrown out of Granada Hills High School. Friends said he 
used the drug at least once a day and that it often made him edgy. 
</P>
<P>
 Family tensions reached the breaking point early Tuesday when Steven Golly 
asked his son to turn down his stereo, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Angered by the demand, Chris shot his father. After the shots, an unidentified 
woman also living in the house fled and called police from a neighbor's home. 
She was accompanied by her son's girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after 1 a.m., six officers in three police cars from the Devonshire 
Division turned the corner at Septo Street and Amestoy Avenue, responding to a 
911 report of gunfire, Lt. John Dunkin said. The woman flagged down the squad 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The first police car stopped directly in front of the Golly home, the second 
at Amestoy and Septo and the third several feet behind. 
</P>
<P>
 As the officers stepped out of their cars, Chris opened fire from his front 
lawn, which is on an embankment about 10 feet above the street. He was, 
according to police, using a rifle of the type usually referred to as the 
AR-15, a civilian version of the military's standard M-16 rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 From Chris' vantage point, the first police car was out of the line of fire, 
but the second two were easily visible, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunkin said one round struck Hamilton, who was crouching behind the open door 
of the third squad car and wearing a protective vest. The bullet punctured the 
door and went through an arm opening in the vest and into her chest. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunfire also shattered windows in two police vehicles and left a dozen 
holes in the body panels, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Chris stopped shooting and retreated into the house, other officers 
discovered that Hamilton was not moving. 
</P>
<P>
 Two more squad cars arrived, and the fatally wounded Hamilton was rushed to 
Northridge Hospital Medical Center by ambulance. She was pronounced dead an 
hour later. 
</P>
<P>
 While officers were removing Hamilton, another five or six shots came from 
inside the home, apparently marking Chris' suicide, Police Chief Willie L. 
Williams said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 After trying without success to reach someone inside the house by telephone, 
SWAT team members tossed tear gas canisters into the home about 6 a.m. and then 
entered. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, police found the body of Steven Golly in a back room used as a den. 
Chris' body lay in a hallway leading to a bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 A youth who described himself as Chris' best friend said he was at the Golly 
house Monday night when father and son were arguing, and that the younger Golly 
was not under the influence of speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Conner said Chris was angry and talked about getting back at or even 
killing his father, a wholesale electrical equipment supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to talk him out of it," Conner said as he awaited police questioning 
at the Devonshire station. "He said he wasn't going to do it, to shoot his 
father. They were having problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just said he had had enough. He snapped, basically. . . . He and his dad 
argued a lot. He lost control. He was completely sober (Monday night). I was 
with him all night, till 10:30." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends said that the older Golly was an avid gun collector, and that his son 
often bragged to his friends about his father's weapons, although the youth was 
not believed to own any guns. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear Tuesday whether the AR-15 rifle Chris used was from that 
collection, and it was unclear what type of the weapon he used.

 Some versions of this type of rifle, which is manufactured in several models 
by different companies -- are legal in California and others are not. A 1989 
state law outlawed the sale of AR-15s manufactured by Hartford, Conn.-based 
Colt Manufacturing Co. But the law allowed owners to keep the weapons if they 
legally acquired them before June 1, 1989, and registered them by Jan. 1, 1991.

 Chris' mother, Pam, died in 1990 while his parents were in the process of 
divorcing. "She was my darling daughter for 40-some odd years," said her 
father, Ernest Reepmaker, who lives in Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five years ago they were the happiest family there could ever be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reepmaker said his daughter developed a "cocaine problem" and died of an 
overdose after the Gollys had separated. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales said Chris had "really been on edge the last couple of weeks. He's 
really been shaky." 
</P>
<P>
 Morales said the boy was doted on, even spoiled, by his father. Steven Golly 
had bought his only son a used Camaro and a Chevy pickup truck, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Steven Golly had grown increasingly frustrated by his son's behavior, 
Morales said. Besides his drug problem, Chris was a fan of so-called speed 
metal music, characterized by loud, grinding guitar riffs and fast-paced 
rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
 "His father reached a point of no return with Chris -- he wanted to help him," 
she said. "He wanted his son to become a decent person again. At that point, 
when Steve could take no more, I think Chris saw it as his father didn't love 
him anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two years, the younger Golly began dressing and acting the part of 
a tough kid -- ditching school, neglecting his studies and using drugs, friends 
and neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Chris' friends who stopped by the house Tuesday said the teen-ager was 
a daily drug user. He liked to drink beer and use pot, and, starting last 
summer, turned to methamphetamine, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton, the daughter of a retired LAPD detective, started her police 
training eight months ago after working for 20 years as a North Hollywood 
nursery manager. She recently moved to a Thousand Oaks apartment after 
separating from her second husband, a firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hospital where Hamilton died, her father, Kenneth Brondell, spoke 
briefly to Chief Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've lost a good one with Christy," Brondell told the chief.

Cheevers, Chip Johnson, Ann W. O'Neill and Mack Reed, and special correspondent 
Thom Mrozek. Scenario of a Shooting 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie LAPD Officer Christy Lynn Hamilton was shot and killed early Tuesday 
while responding to a domestic dispute in Northridge. During the five-hour 
ordeal the suspect and his father were killed. According to police, Steve Golly 
was shot by his son during an argument. Christopher Golly then shot Hamilton 
and shot and killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Five people, including suspect and his father, lived at the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspect fires at officers from behind brick wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspect shot 12 to 15 bullets into police cars. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two rounds are shot into Hamilton's car. One passes through driver's 
door, fatally wounding her. 
</P>
<P>
 The chain of events as described by police: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Neighbors report hearing shots about 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Call comes into LAPD's Devonshire Division at 1:18 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Three cars from Devonshire Division responding to radio call arrive at 
scene between 1:18 and 1:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Officers see woman on Amestoy Avenue walking toward them, waving her arms. 
Assuming house is mid-block, officers from first two cars leave their cars and 
approach her. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Christopher Golly fires shots from behind brick wall alongside house toward 
cars across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Officer Hamilton, in third car, opens her door, gets out and crouches 
behind door. Bullet goes through door and enters her arm at edge of bulletproof 
vest. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Officers rush to aid Hamilton, realize she is badly wounded and move her to 
ambulance. She is rushed to Northridge Hospital Medical Center. She is 
pronounced dead an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Golly returns to house and as Hamilton is being moved, five or six more 
shots are heard from inside house. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Officers surround house and are unsuccessful at attempting to phone 
occupants. 
</P>
<P>
 10. SWAT team arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 11. Shortly before 6 a.m., team lobs tear-gas canisters into house. A few 
minutes later, team enters house and finds the bodies of Steven and Christopher 
Golly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Weapon 
</P>
<P>
 The weapon used in the killing of Hamilton is believed to have been an assault 
rifle similar to the Colt AR-15. Manufactured in various configurations by 
different companies, these weapons are civilian versions of the M-16, a popular 
assault rifle used by some U.S. military services. 
</P>
<P>
 * Weapon ban. The Colt version of the semiautomatic weapon was among a number 
of assault weapons banned by the state in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 * Typical features: Most AR-15s have a .223-caliber round are are equipped 
with magazines capable of carrying between five and 20 rounds of ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 * Collecting: The AR-15 has long been a favorite of collectors and gun 
enthusiasts since the M-16 was made popular in the Vietnam War.

CIA OFFICIAL HELD AS RUSSIAN SPY; ESPIONAGE: AGENT AND HIS WIFE ARE ACCUSED OF 
TAKING $1.5 MILLION FROM SOVIET UNION AND LATER RUSSIA. CLINTON CALLS 
ALLEGATIONS ABOUT HIGH-LEVEL MOLE 'VERY SERIOUS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A veteran CIA official, who had far-ranging access to intelligence secrets, 
and his wife were charged Tuesday with spying for the former Soviet Union and 
later for the Russian Federation in return for $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 With the arrests, Aldrich Hazen Ames, 52, who served for two years as chief of 
the CIA's Soviet counterintelligence branch, becomes the highest level agent to 
be accused of being a "mole" while still working for the agency. His wife, 
Maria Del Rosario Casas Ames, 41, once was a paid CIA source in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 While President Clinton described the espionage case as "very serious," 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher told the senior diplomat at the Russian 
Embassy here that the United States was "outraged" and suggested that the 
Russians should recall at least one of their intelligence officers as a sign of 
contrition. 
</P>
<P>
 Vladimir I. Chkhikvitchvill, deputy chief of Russia's diplomatic mission, had 
no reply, according to officials at the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Other U.S. officials said that they hoped the Russians would respond quickly 
with a gesture that would bring the episode to an end and avoid damaging 
U.S.-Russian relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, U.S. officials said the damage to American intelligence could be 
devastating. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had access to the most sensitive data of all," a former senior 
intelligence official at the CIA said. "He would have had all of the 
operational details in terms of the identities of our people there (in the 
former Soviet Union) and how we went about our business. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence 
Committee, likened the potential impact to that caused by notorious spies John 
A. Walker Jr. and Ronald Pelton. Walker, a Navy warrant officer, and Pelton, a 
National Security Agency official, gave crucial U.S. defense information to the 
Soviets in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said that Ames and his wife continued their spying activities 
until they were arrested by FBI agents Monday. Ames was taken into custody on 
his way to work, while his wife was arrested at their Arlington, Va., home. 
</P>
<P>
 They were arraigned Tuesday on federal charges of conspiracy to commit 
espionage. If convicted, they could face maximum sentences of life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 According to an affidavit unsealed in federal court in Alexandria, Va., 
Tuesday, Ames met with intelligence officers of the Soviet KGB and its 
successor, the SVRR, beginning in 1985 and provided them with classified 
information on CIA operations and personnel. That information allegedly 
included the identity and code name of a CIA source inside the Soviet 
counterintelligence division in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames and his wife are accused of using "dead drops" in the Washington area -- 
prearranged locations where agents drop off material and pick up payments -- 
and "signal sites" -- a prearranged place where agents communicate simple 
messages -- without ever meeting face-to-face with the Russian contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ames were arrested after extensive physical, video and electronic 
surveillance, officials said. U.S. agents tapped their telephones, rummaged 
through their trash, examined ribbons and disks from their home computer and 
printer and followed the couple to various sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal complaint claims that the Ames, who have a 5-year-old son, 
deposited more than $1.5 million in payments from the Russians in banks here 
and abroad, including two Swiss bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames earned an annual CIA salary of $69,843. Financial records showed his 
take-home salary totaled $336,164 from April, 1985, through last November. Over 
the same period, however, records show that he and his wife spent at least 
$1,397,300. 
</P>
<P>
 Their purchases included a residence in a prosperous Arlington neighborhood. 
They paid $540,000 in cash for a home there in 1989 -- a transaction that 
caught the attention of real estate agents in the Washington suburb. Other 
expenditures, according to the affidavit by FBI Agent Leslie G. Wiser Jr., 
included a $25,000 down payment on a 1992 Jaguar, $99,000 in home improvements, 
$165,000 in stock and security purchases, $25,000 in Georgetown University 
tuition, where Mrs. Ames is a part-time student, and $455,000 in credit card 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames also owns two condominium apartments and a farm in Colombia, his wife's 
birthplace, according to the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
 Counterintelligence experts expressed incredulity over Ames' spending habits 
and Skip Brandon, who retired in January as acting assistant director of the 
FBI's intelligence division, indicated that they were part of the "mosaic" of 
information that led authorities to suspect him. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon noted that the financial affairs of those holding government security 
clearances are reviewed every three to five years and that this review has 
grown more systematic and careful in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Ronald Kessler, who has written several books on FBI and CIA 
operations, said it was a tip from a former KGB employee that led authorities 
to Ames and his wife. Kessler said that the source provided the information to 
the FBI nearly two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon and several government sources insisted, however, that no single 
source or event led to the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI Director Louis J. Freeh said that "FBI agents worked doggedly on this case 
-- not for months, but for years -- with the CIA's unwavering assistance every 
step of the way." 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be very leery of anyone from any quarter who suggested there was a 
prime moving event," said a U.S. intelligence source. 
</P>
<P>
 "This did not come from any one source. . . . There was active information 
developed over a number of years, including from advanced analytic techniques. 
It was not the result of any one tip-off or smoking gun. . . . This was an 
accumulation of evidence from all sources. It did not come at a specific period 
of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Until his arrest, Ames, who joined the CIA 31 years ago, was working as an 
operations officer in the counternarcotics center at CIA headquarters in 
Langley, Va., where he was responsible for developing information that would 
help stem the narcotics trade in the Black Sea area. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to heading the Soviet counterintelligence branch in the CIA's 
Soviet-East European division from 1983 to 1985, Ames saw duty in Washington, 
New York, Mexico City, Rome and Ankara, Turkey, according to the FBI affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
 To his neighbors, Rick Ames was known as a friendly, outgoing man who seemed 
to work hard and spend his free time cultivating his backyard vegetable garden 
and taking care of his son, Paul. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't at all flashy or ostentatious -- anything but," said William 
Rhoads, a retired foreign service officer who lives nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Other neighbors said that they saw Ames' Jaguar and knew he had spent some 
money remodeling his kitchen. But many of them had remodeled too, and fancy 
cars like Jaguars were not unknown in their neighborhood, where most houses 
cost more than $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't see any signs that they were greedy," said Tommye Morton, a writer 
of historical romance novels who lives across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames told neighbors that he worked for the State Department, specializing in 
Eastern Europe. But he said little about his work, did not discuss 
international affairs and betrayed no particular disgruntlement with U.S. 
policy, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors knew his wife to be reserved and dedicated to her post-graduate 
studies in philosophy at Georgetown University. 
</P>
<P>
 Official Moscow was silent when the Ames arrest was reported Tuesday evening. 
Yevgeny Primakov, director of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, was on 
an official visit to Slovenia, and a spokesman in Moscow declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But one of Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin's closest advisers, Mikhail N. 
Poltoranin, called the incident "nothing special." 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the Americans) work for us, our people work for them," Poltoranin said, 
asserting that even such close allies as England and the United States spy on 
each other. "Intelligence is intelligence," Poltoranin said. 
</P>
<P>
 He faulted Russian spy handlers for possibly recruiting an agent who spent 
heavily and indiscreetly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, we should not recruit such idiots who do not know how to live, but 
in principle, this is a necessary process," Poltoranin said. 
</P>

Richter and Michael Ross in Washington contributed to this story.

COLUMN ONE; GETTING GRADES FOR DIVERSITY?; USC AND STANFORD ARE AMONG SCHOOLS 
IRATE OVER TOUGH PLAN TO CERTIFY COLLEGES. AT STAKE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW 
CULTURE SHOULD BE TAUGHT AND WHO SHOULD JUDGE THE TEACHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Open rebellion has broken out at some of California's most prestigious private 
universities, but the protesters occupying the administration buildings are not 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 The dissidents are led by such academic luminaries as Stanford President 
Gerhard Casper -- who vows to block the "intrusion" of outside forces into 
higher education -- and the presidents of USC and Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
 Their robes have been ruffled by a little-known proposal to hold colleges 
accountable for fostering cultural diversity on campus -- using the secretive 
quality-control process known as accreditation. 
</P>
<P>
 Casper called the plan an affront to academic freedom that could erode the 
quality of higher education. USC President Steven B. Sample said the proposal 
is naive and hypocritical. Caltech President Thomas E. Everhart labeled the 
move politically correct and urged its sponsors to "stick to their knitting." 
</P>
<P>
 Their ire is aimed at a 20-page "statement on diversity" up for a vote today 
before the Western Assn. of Schools and Colleges, a private organization that 
exists to certify the quality of 145 institutions of higher education in 
California, Hawaii and Guam. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement is billed as a guideline to help the schools evaluate their own 
progress toward making campuses more multicultural. But it also makes clear 
that schools will be judged on how thoroughly they address diversity in their 
courses and faculties. 
</P>
<P>
 If the statement is adopted, institutions would be obliged to conduct a 
"thoughtful engagement" with the new guidelines. The statement also suggests 
that schools extend their curricula beyond traditional Western values, asks 
schools to pay attention to the ethnic make-up of their student body and 
reaffirms a 1988 goal to encourage "cultural diversity as an outcome of 
undergraduate instruction." 
</P>
<P>
 "All that is being required is that institutions be engaged in thoughtful self 
study about these issues," said Stephen S. Weiner, executive director of the 
association's college accrediting commission. "People see in documents all 
kinds of things, some of which were intended and some of which were not." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiner said that 90 of the association's member institutions -- including five 
UC campuses and the Hawaii campus of Brigham Young University -- favor the 
diversity statement. Fourteen schools have come out against, he said, all of 
them private. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford, USC, Pepperdine and Caltech -- joined by some lesser-known religious 
schools -- have been lobbying furiously against today's vote in San Francisco. 
While they say it is necessary to teach students the virtues of racial harmony 
and cultural understanding, these academic giants threaten to break ranks over 
the issue and start their own accrediting body. 
</P>
<P>
 Such down-and-dirty brawls are not the norm in the deferential world of 
academia. Many say it portends what could become a Holy War over what has been 
a smoldering issue in higher education: Just who should grade the universities? 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, accrediting colleges and universities is a government 
responsibility. But in America, the task of determining whether a school is fit 
to educate students has developed over a century into a Byzantine system run by 
obscure associations whose boards are dominated by the very schools they 
inspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, nine regional associations accredit two- and four-year institutions 
across the United States -- a jigsaw configuration that even those intimately 
involved in the system acknowledge is "historical accident." Accreditation is 
granted after a school conducts a "self-study" and a small team of outside 
academics visits a campus and writes a separate critique. 
</P>
<P>
 Although reams of paperwork are generated during these reviews, nothing is 
publicly disclosed except the final decision to grant or withhold 
accreditation. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, accreditation means a school has met minimum requirements of the 
peer review panel. Though the stamp of approval may be faint, it can be crucial 
-- especially for lesser-known colleges and for-profit trade schools -- because 
the federal government only sends money for loans and grants to approved 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But with rising tuition, student loan defaults nationally hovering near 20%, 
employers complaining about inept college graduates and embarrassing scandals 
like the research overcharges at Stanford, pressure is building for the 
government to begin regulating colleges as they do consumer services. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, a 1992 federal law spelled out exactly what accrediting 
associations were responsible for -- including tracking default rates and 
statistics showing how successful a school's graduates were in finding jobs -- 
and it created government agencies that would take over the review of problem 
institutions. These new agencies, called State Postsecondary Review Entities, 
will be able to investigate a school's finances and whether its advertising had 
been "misleading." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the law was aimed at for-profit schools, David A. Longanecker, 
assistant U.S. Secretary of Education, said it telegraphed a "growing 
disaffection" with higher education in general. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Atwell, president of the American Council on Education, said the 
government's move to "federalize" accreditation represents a potential "sea 
change" in how higher education does business. Although the public has 
confidence in America's universities, opinion surveys show that people are 
"scared to death of the sticker price" of a college education, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, schools are under increasing pressure to prove they are getting 
results, said Atwell. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to show something has happened to (students) during their four years 
besides seat time and grades," said Atwell, whose group represents 1,600 
schools nationwide. "None of those things tell you what's going on in the 
place. They don't get at the question of 'value added.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Western Assn. of Schools and Colleges has become so concerned about public 
accountability that it is considering a plan to measure how well students are 
educated and making public the results, as well as other findings of the 
accreditation process. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a very significant body of opinion in higher education that says to 
the public, 'Trust us. And don't require us to produce any evidence (of 
results),' " said Weiner. "What we're saying is that those days are over. 
Institutions and faculty have got to demonstrate that good things are happening 
to students. We think they are . . . but we've got to talk about our strengths 
and weaknesses in public." 
</P>
<P>
 But for months the normally obscure accrediting body -- which examines 
everyone from Stanford to the tiny, 63-student Franciscan School of Theology in 
Berkeley -- has been locked in a vituperative war with some of the biggest 
names in California academia over its proposed statement explaining how member 
institutions should interpret the term diversity.  
</P>
<P>
 While Weiner said the new statement was merely background for schools trying 
to understand a 1988 diversity guideline, some college officials view the new 
statement as an attempt by the association to force multiculturalism down their 
throats. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're fundamentally opposed to it because it is an intrusion on institutional 
autonomy," said Thomas Dillon, president of Thomas Aquinas College in Santa 
Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 Dillon said his 200-student private Catholic college feared the statement 
could be used to force it to redesign its liberal arts core curriculum. There 
are no majors at the school and every student must read the works of Euclid, 
Ptolemy, Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Einstein and about 100 other authors. 
</P>
<P>
 All save one, Jane Austen, are European men. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they mean we ought to include an author because of the gender, or because 
of the skin color, that's not appropriate for this curriculum," Dillon said. 
"We read them because of what they have to say about reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiner added that Thomas Aquinas officials have been among the first and 
loudest opponents because they have done a poor job of diversifying their 
student body, which has only two black students. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tiny college has gained some powerful allies. 
</P>
<P>
 USC's Sample sent a letter last week asking the association to table its votes 
and criticizing the "disingenuous" way the statement glosses over the 
difficulties of balancing diversity against open access. In a letter dated Feb. 
10, Caltech's Everhart urged the accrediting group to avoid a diversity 
standard that "appears to many to be political, not educational." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked in a recent interview what he meant, Everhart said: "Have you followed 
the discussions on political correctness? . . . You can extend some of those 
arguments to this situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the statement's most powerful foe, however, has been Stanford's 
Casper. Stanford took flak from alumni and conservatives several years ago when 
it altered its traditional Western Civilization reading requirement to 
introduce authors from other cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech before the Stanford faculty senate on Feb. 3, Casper lambasted the 
diversity statement and declared "Enough is enough!" The senate voted to oppose 
the statement. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Casper warned that tighter control by either accrediting 
bodies or the government would ruin a system of higher education that allows 
Stanford and Thomas Aquinas College to serve students of different tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lemmings run into the sea together and I don't want to do that," he said. "I 
don't want us all to do the same thing at the same time. That's not what has 
made American institutions as good as they are -- and they are stunning."

COUNTY BOARD OKS FREEZE OF PENSION BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a surprise turnabout, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on 
Tuesday adopted a reform plan that will freeze controversial pension benefits 
for more than 84,000 current employees and save taxpayers millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than two hours of debate, Supervisor Ed Edelman, who had been 
blocking the reform plan, suddenly told his colleagues "we need to put this 
behind us" and agreed to support the changes proposed by Supervisor Gloria 
Molina. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Edelman joined Molina and her ally, Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, 
the victory was assured and the vote was recorded as unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
 "It ends the era of pension spiking," Molina said. "If I could, I'd do a 
somersault for you. It's what I've been fighting for for two years." 
</P>
<P>
 The vote will freeze the amount of fringe benefits that can be calculated into 
retirement pay, starting Jan. 1, 1995, but does not alter the county's unusual 
method of calculating pension pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a county plan adopted in 1990, employees' pensions had been drastically 
increased by adding the value of fringe benefits to salaries for purposes of 
computing pension pay. The rules boosted pensions of the most senior employees 
by up to 19% and made it possible for some employees to earn more in retirement 
than they did while working. 
</P>
<P>
 In adopting the freeze, the board approved a critical element of a 
comprehensive reform plan prepared by the county's Economy and Efficiency 
Commission and promoted by Molina. The citizens group blasted the pension plan 
as wasteful and self-serving. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeze controls the growth of pension costs, but it does nothing to 
relieve the $400 million in pension liabilities created when the county adopted 
the new rules. The consensus among legal authorities is that the county may not 
rescind benefits already granted. 
</P>
<P>
 After the vote, commission Chairman Gunther Buerk said that "a black cloud 
over the county has been lifted." But he added, "We still think that in 1990 a 
mistake was made" that has been extremely costly to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Fox, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn., said that after two 
years of near constant criticism, the supervisors "have realized the importance 
of this and they did the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "They have taken a significant step," added Rebecca Taylor of the California 
Taxpayers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Both taxpayer groups are suing the county to eliminate the pension rules 
retroactively. Their case is on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The board on Tuesday also approved a motion by Supervisor Mike Antonovich that 
would reduce the amount of medical insurance benefits that can be calculated 
into pension pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The two actions could save the county $18 million a year, according to Chief 
Administrative Officer Sally Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote came one week after the board approved some limited reforms. Last 
Tuesday the board voted 3 to 2 to deny new employees the more generous elements 
of the pension plan, if it can be negotiated in the collective bargaining 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina and Burke voted against that action because they said it did not go far 
enough. They argued that the board should immediately eliminate the pension 
benefits for new management employees. But Edelman, joined by supervisors 
Antonovich and Deane Dana, advocated a more cautious approach. They also 
delayed action on Molina's call for a freeze on benefits for current employees 
and indicated they would not support it. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Edelman countered Molina by initially proposing only a partial 
freeze on benefits for current workers. But after about two hours of debate and 
additional testimony by legal experts, Edelman threw his support to Molina. 
</P>
<P>
 That action completes the package of reforms advocated by the advisory 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's decision four years ago to increase pensions, initially for 
senior county employees and elected officials, has been criticized in a string 
of investigations, studies, legislation and lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 The county grand jury called the rules "the height of fiscal irresponsibility" 
and urged the board to "set an example of responsible government" and rescind 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The pension rules, revealed by The Times two years ago, were adopted without a 
public vote of the supervisors or any study of financial impact. The decision 
immediately created a pension fund deficit of about $267 million. The deficit 
grew to more than $400 million after the rules were extended to include rank 
and file employees on a limited basis. The deficit has to be repaid within 20 
years.

TONYA VS. NANCY: CHOOSING YOUR SIDE CAN BE REVEALING; SPORTS: HARDING FANS 
EMPATHIZE WITH HER NEED FOR RECOGNITION, ANALYSTS SAY. KERRIGAN'S ADMIRE HARD 
WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Tonya or Nancy? 
</P>
<P>
 It will be a simple choice for Debbie Longo. "I'm rooting for Nancy," said the 
21-year-old Citrus Community College sophomore who once dreamed of being an 
Olympic equestrian but now tries to content herself with breeding horses. "You 
work every day to get a gold medal and someone comes and bashes her leg in -- 
and she still didn't give up. . . . When that happened to her, I knew that 
feeling: to have your dream shattered." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Clever is just as sure of her favorite. "Tonya," said the 28-year-old 
office manager from the Northern California town of Sunnyvale. "That's how I 
was -- very bad, very black sheep of the family, trying to show yourself and 
get some attention." 
</P>
<P>
 In the annals of sports rivalries great and small, Ali versus Frazier, Magic 
versus Bird, the Yankees versus the Dodgers, Chris Evert versus Martina 
Navratilova, the L.A. Raiders versus anyone, today's matchup of Nancy Kerrigan 
versus Tonya Harding ranks as a classic exercise in choosing sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps not since after Giant pitcher Juan Marichal whacked Dodger catcher 
John Roseboro on the head with a bat in Candlestick Park in the summer of 1965 
has there been such anticipation to see what would happen the next time two 
warring athletes -- linked uncomfortably by a shocking act of violence -- 
ventured again within a sporting arena. (When the two baseball players did meet 
again, nothing happened.) 
</P>
<P>
 The global village, it seems, is divided into cheering sections -- and whom 
you back may say more about you than it does about either of the skaters in the 
spotlight. When it comes time to choose between Kerrigan and Harding, most 
people will choose their soul mate on ice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone said life is like an inkblot upon which we project all of our 
unfulfilled secret needs and fears," said psychologist Chaytor Mason, professor 
emeritus at USC. "That's exactly what's going on here." The Tonya people, he 
speculated, "are projecting their own unfulfilled needs for recognition, the 15 
minutes of fame . . . for the times when even though they worked hard at the 
company they were unrecognized and some pretty young competitor got all the 
glory. They're projecting onto this situation." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Nancy people: "They're the Mr. Rights or the Ms. Rights. They do 
things right," Mason said. "Certainly the Tonya people are more noticeable. But 
I would say in the long run, probably there are more Nancy people. Most of us 
do believe in playing the game by the rules and making a success by sheer hard 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 As television executives eagerly await a viewing audience of Super Bowl 
proportions for tonight's technical program -- better known as "the showdown in 
Norway" -- no consensus has emerged over the image in which to cast these two 
athletes: Kerrigan is the victim of a vicious attack or the beneficiary of 
unearned media attention. Harding is the beleaguered, hard-fighting underdog or 
the devious, unsporting competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 But the urge to weigh in has been irresistible, attracting pundits from all 
over the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot us have had some Tonya in our lives," said the Rev. Jesse Jackson. "We 
have known some rejection . . . some misunderstanding. . . . All the stuff we 
know about esteem-building, she's not had much of that. And yet in spite of 
that, she keeps smiling on the outside and skating at the highest levels. And 
her insides must look like shattered glass." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson diplomatically declined to take sides. "I obviously hope both do 
well," he said. But his compassion for Harding is unquestionable. "Whether it's 
Tupac Shakur or Mike Tyson or Tonya Harding, these children were not born this 
way. . . . Let's have some sense of correction and redemption and mercy toward 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Others are less diplomatic. "Tonya's like me," Democratic political analyst 
Bob Beckel quipped breathlessly on "CBS This Morning." "She takes no 
prisoners." 
</P>
<P>
 Her appeal, in fact, seems not unlike that of the Raiders, those bad boys of 
the silver and black. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologist Mason said: "The people who wear Raider caps, they're largely 
toward Tonya. They believe they've been deprived, they have been denied their 
rightful place in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side are the people who deplore the Raiders. "I am 
psychologically and morally incapable of rooting for the Raiders," said 
screenwriter Marshall Goldberg, who grew up in Pittsburgh but has lived in Los 
Angeles for 15 years. "The Raiders were scum -- on their best days. They were 
always dirty. They cheated." 
</P>
<P>
 And for people such as Goldberg, who are incensed by injustice -- "I was 17 
when Martin Luther King marched in Washington" -- the specter of Harding on the 
ice is shameful. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't expect to be treated fairly in their own lives," Goldberg said. 
"But they can't stand seeing someone else not treated fairly. Particularly 
someone who played by the rules. And I think Nancy Kerrigan played by the 
rules. . . . Tonya Harding represents whatever you can get away with (is) OK." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time that Kerrigan is perceived as a victim, she is also perceived 
as a winner. After all, look at what she's already won: seven figures worth of 
endorsement deals, a post-knee-whacking ice-skating television special that 
aired prior to the Olympics, and, of course, that bronze medal she took home 
from the 1992 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's one thing people in this country love, it's a winner," said Brian 
Murphy, publisher of the Sports Marketing Letter in Westport, Conn. "People 
want to be winners, they admire what it takes to be winners." 
</P>
<P>
 That explains some of the appeal of the Dallas Cowboys in last month's Super 
Bowl -- even though they were matched against a team that might have been 
expected to attract the sympathy vote, the oft-disappointing Buffalo Bills. 
"The Cowboys have a long tradition of winning even though the Bills were the 
underdogs," Murphy said. The same may go for the figure skaters: "People may be 
giving Kerrigan an edge because they see her as a winner. People may be looking 
at Harding's troubles on the ice and not necessarily see her as a winner." 
</P>
<P>
 There are differences in their skating styles -- Kerrigan is more balletic, 
Harding is more athletic and famous for (sometimes) landing the triple axel -- 
but they count far less than personality, it seems. 
</P>
<P>
 When Yankee teammates Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris were in neck and neck 
competition to break Babe Ruth's single-season home run record in 1961, most 
fans were rabidly supporting Mantle. "He was a familiar face, the fans had been 
with him, they had suffered through his highs and lows, and they wanted him to 
do it," Murphy said. Maris, on the other hand, was newer to the Yankees, 
younger and "didn't fit into (the fans') image," Murphy said. "He didn't fit 
into their image by not being Mickey Mantle. And that was about as unfair as 
anything could get." In fact, Maris broke the record and was emotionally 
crushed by the fans' resentment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Harding and Kerrigan, some are disdainful of the media 
spectacle and choose neither of the above. What about the other skaters? What 
about Bosnia? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd actually like someone from, like, Slovakia to win," said Eric Gregory, 
30, as he stood in the Santa Monica sports bar Legends recently, watching a 
truly passionate rivalry play out. On the television screen was the 
Indiana-Purdue basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a rivalry because there's respect -- both teams are really good," 
said Gregory, an Indiana alumnus. "Tonya Harding doesn't have a leg to stand on 
-- no pun intended." 
</P>
<P>
 An air of good old American cynicism has crept in. "Kerrigan seems to be kind 
of distant and remote to me -- the kind of girl who would break up with you 
long distance," comedian Jeff Cesario said. "Tonya Harding would break up with 
you by dousing your car with lighter fluid and setting it on fire." 
</P>
<P>
 But even when you don't like them -- and Donna Fisher, 34, swears she is not 
fond of either -- you're inexorably drawn into the drama. "I identify with 
Tonya," Fisher confessed as she paused on a recent visit to Universal CityWalk. 
"I got kicked off the cheerleading squad in high school. When I heard Tonya 
might not get to go to the Olympics, I thought, 'My God, it's me all over 
again!' " 
</P>
<P>
 This is one of our great "public dramas," as psychologist and lawyer Rex 
Beaber puts it. "I think Americans maybe uniquely have an incredible lust for 
direct confrontation," Beaber said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greatest disappointment to the American public would be if these people 
performed 8th and 12th respectively. What the American people want is 1 and 2 
respectively. There'll be a lot of disappointment if one of them messes up 
spectacularly and there isn't a close competition. What they want is a 10-round 
fight."

GREENSPAN SAYS FED MAY RAISE INTEREST RATES AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan warned Tuesday that the nation's 
central bank could raise interest rates again soon to keep a lid on inflation, 
prompting new concerns in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 In his semiannual report to Congress, Greenspan said that the nation's 
recovery is beginning to roll in most parts of the country and that the Federal 
Reserve stands ready to take tough preemptive action to keep inflationary 
pressures from building and the economy from overheating. He called raising 
interest rates a form of "low-cost insurance" against future inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Administration officials said they expect to announce soon that 
White House economic adviser Alan Blinder would be named vice chairman of the 
Federal Reserve, making him what an Administration official called a "leading 
candidate" to succeed Greenspan when his second term expires in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan is a lifelong Republican who was first appointed by President Ronald 
Reagan in 1987 and then reappointed by President George Bush. As vice chairman, 
Blinder would succeed David Mullins, who was appointed by Bush in 1990 and 
resigned effective Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan told a House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs subcommittee Tuesday 
that "if the Federal Reserve is to promote long-term growth, we must 
contribute, as best we can, to keeping inflation pressures contained." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan said that "to promote sustainable growth . . . real short-term rates 
are more likely to have to rise than fall from here. I cannot, however, tell 
you at this time when any such rise would occur." 
</P>
<P>
 In the arcane world of monetary policy, such comments amount to a thinly 
veiled threat that the Federal Reserve is ready to raise rates again at any 
time to head off rising prices. In fact, most economists expect the Fed to 
raise rates two or three times, leaving them by the end of 1994 as much as 1 
full percentage point higher than they were at the close of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction in Washington was subdued. Unlike the Bush Administration, the 
Clinton White House in recent weeks has sought to avoid any public 
confrontations with the Federal Reserve over economic policy, and officials 
played down the significance of the central bank's decision to raise rates 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the White House repeatedly has pointed to the decline in interest rates 
over the last year as the most important effect of the Clinton 
deficit-reduction plan. Aggressive Federal Reserve action to move rates back up 
will clearly increase tensions between the Administration and the central bank, 
which continues to be dominated by Republican appointees. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton told reporters Tuesday that "there is no reason to believe 
there is an inflation problem." He said long-term interest rates, which rise 
with investors' expectations of inflation, could be "considerably lower than 
they are" -- about 6.5% for U.S. government bonds that mature in 10 years or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said the Administration likes interest rates 
where they are. "The continuation of low interest rates has (helped) get the 
economy going again," Myers told reporters. "We hope that long-term interest 
rates stay low." 
</P>
<P>
 In Congress, Greenspan met more direct complaints. Rep. Paul E. Kanjorski 
(D-Pa.), chairman of the banking subcommittee, made it clear that he did not 
want the central bank to decide unilaterally to slow the economy even before it 
has a chance to gather momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like many Americans, I am concerned that the Federal Reserve's action may 
impede or even end our slow economic recovery," he told Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me you almost have a phobia when it comes to inflation," Rep. 
Toby Roth (R-Wis.) said. "Do you see the Fed focusing maybe too much on 
inflation and to the detriment of an expanding economy?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Greenspan said that "the most virulent element to create economic distress 
and unemployment is inflationary pressures which have been allowed to get out 
of hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan's warning follows the Federal Reserve's decision earlier this month 
to raise its benchmark federal funds rate, which banks pay on overnight loans 
from other banks, for the first time in five years. That rate hike, to 3.25% 
from 3%, sparked a 96-point selloff in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's comments by Greenspan had the opposite effect. Stocks and bonds 
finished higher after Greenspan's reassurance that the Fed is adopting a 
consistent stance and would take a get-tough approach to inflation. The Dow 
Jones industrial average gained about 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing concern in Washington about interest rates comes as congressional 
Democrats are pressing the Fed to open its closed-door deliberations to the 
public and to submit to greater oversight from the White House and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan has been caught for months in a running battle with House Banking 
Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) over whether the Fed should release 
transcripts of closed-door Fed meetings about monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez is also pushing legislation that would require the 12 presidents of 
the Federal Reserve's regional banks to be nominated by the President, thus 
increasing White House influence over decision-making at the central bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The President now appoints the members of the Fed's board of governors, but 
the regional bank presidents, who have a strong voice in interest rate policy, 
are named by the board of directors of their banks with the approval of the 
Fed's board of governors. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan is also at odds with the Administration over its proposal to 
consolidate banking regulatory authority into one new agency, stripping the 
central bank of its regulatory powers. Greenspan has said he believes that 
would permanently weaken the Fed's ability to monitor and influence the 
direction of the nation's financial system. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the central bank's seven-member board of governors has a second 
vacancy. The Administration wanted to nominate George Perry, an economist at 
the Brookings Institution, a Washington policy research organization. 
</P>
<P>
 But Perry apparently withdrew his name from consideration. He was interested 
in the board seat only if it might lead to the vice chairmanship, 
Administration officials said. They added that they planned to seek a woman or 
minority for the second vacancy to balance the appointment of Blinder, a white 
male. Perry could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Blinder, 48, is a former Princeton University economist who served as an 
economic adviser to the Clinton presidential campaign in 1992. He could not be 
reached for comment.

SLAIN OFFICER AN INSPIRATION TO ACADEMY MATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She was a 45-year-old mother of two, by far the oldest police rookie in her 
class. Her father was a retired Los Angeles police detective. And recently, 
Christy Lynne Hamilton's classmates in the Police Academy voted her the most 
inspirational new officer -- an honor named after slain Officer Tina Kerbrat. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Hamilton's name again was linked with Kerbrat's as she became the 
second woman in LAPD history to be slain in the line of duty. Only four days 
before, Hamilton was standing proudly next to her father as she finally 
realized her dream, which came so late in life, to follow in his footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Kenneth L. Brondell, had planned to meet his daughter Tuesday 
morning for breakfast and "to shoot the breeze," he said. Instead, he found 
himself at a Northridge hospital, hearing the words a police officer's family 
dreads most: His daughter had fallen while in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those offering solace was Police Chief Willie L. Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chief, you've lost a good one with Christy," Brondell responded. "You had a 
mature, compassionate, intelligent person who had lived life already, and made 
it to the age of 45 and decided to start her career at that point." 
</P>
<P>
 He would later tell a reporter that "for the first time in my life, I feel 
sorry I was ever a police officer." 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled how his former wife had warned him against encouraging their 
daughter to wear a badge. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was not happy about Christy becoming a police officer because of the 
danger," he said, stopping to regain his composure, "which makes me feel 
guilty. I had a lot of influence on her." 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of her slaying, Hamilton was being mourned throughout the 
department that she and her father loved. The terrible ironies linking her name 
to Kerbrat's were well understood at the Devonshire station, where officers -- 
like others throughout the city -- wore black mourning bands across their 
police badges in memory of their slain colleague. 
</P>
<P>
 In just a few short weeks, they said, Hamilton had endeared herself to them 
like few others. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a breath of fresh air," said Lt. Dan Hoffman, who 20 years ago had 
served with Hamilton's father in the San Fernando Valley. "She was a pleasure 
to have here. Her father and mother were extremely proud of her." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in 1948, Hamilton grew up in North Hollywood before attending Valley 
Junior College. She left school to marry Richard Steven, with whom she had a 
son and a daughter, and worked at his family's nursery business in North 
Hollywood for 20 years, until just before she entered the Police Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 After divorcing Steven, she married Harold Steven Hamilton, a Los Angeles City 
firefighter, in 1977. The couple were in the process of getting divorced at the 
time of her death. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton had a daughter, Kelly, 24, and son, William, 21, from her first 
marriage, and two stepsons, Lance Hamilton and Jody Hamilton, from her second 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton had long wanted to follow her father into the Los Angeles Police 
Department, but had all but given up because of her age. She had gone back to 
school, earning a liberal arts degree from Cal State Northridge in December, 
1992. Then in October, her father called and told her the LAPD had lifted the 
age ceiling so people over 34 could apply. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did and just followed it through, and here I am," she told reporters at her 
graduation last Friday. "My father was a Los Angeles police officer for 30 
years. I always wanted to be a police officer, but I got married when I was 19 
(and) started a family, and my life sort of changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton was voted most inspirational in her class by her peers, who cited her 
upbeat attitude and her perseverance. Colleagues said she endured the physical 
and mental rigors of police training that many men half her age could not hold 
up under. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very positive," said Nick Fotiades, the Police Academy's senior 
training officer for Hamilton's class. "She just hung in there. She never 
quit." 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Michael Reyes, leader of Hamilton's graduating class, said her 
toughest challenge was purely physical, of making it through the obstacle 
course and "scaling the wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Determined to succeed, Reyes said Hamilton would go out on the obstacle course 
early and constructed a makeshift wall to help her improve. 
</P>
<P>
 "She really didn't allow her age to play a factor," said Reyes. "She was there 
to become an LAPD officer." 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, Hamilton was struggling with the rigors of training. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, she felt as if she didn't know if she could make it," her father 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time of graduation, Hamilton not only had conquered the obstacle 
course but won the admiration of her classmates and family. Reyes remembered 
meeting Hamilton's family at a pre-graduation breakfast Friday, and how she and 
her father had beamed at each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was on cloud nine," he said. "She was extremely proud of her father, and 
he was extremely proud of her." 
</P>
<P>
 Called up early with her other classmates because of the earthquake, Hamilton 
had been on the street for a month. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Tuesday, Hamilton's father remembered how proud he was of his 
daughter when she walked down the aisle at graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, becoming a cop was something Hamilton told friends she wanted 
for herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was the most self-disciplined and determined person I ever met," said her 
brother, Kenneth Brondell Jr. "If she got it in her mind to do something she 
was going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 At Parker Center, headquarters for the LAPD, flags were ordered to fly at half 
staff; just days earlier they were lowered in memory of two Palos Verdes 
Estates officers who were shot and killed this month. 
</P>
<P>
 After a moment of silence at the weekly Police Commission meeting, Williams 
recounted his conversation with the rookie officer's father at the hospital 
that morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Los Angeles Police Department will never know the type of officer it lost 
this morning," Williams said Hamilton's father told him. "Only her family will 
know."

LEGISLATORS ARE FINDING NEW USES FOR SUMMITS; POLITICS: LAWMAKERS TREAT 
GATHERINGS AS HIGH-PROFILE FORUMS. CRITICS SAY THEY REFLECT CAPITOL GRIDLOCK, 
BUT SOME OBSERVERS SAY THEY BRING ISSUES TO CONSTITUENTS.

<P>
 Summits once were reserved for foreign policy, a way for allies to map 
strategy or superpowers to size up one another. 
</P>
<P>
 The term conjures up images of a frail Franklin D. Roosevelt, wrapped in a 
blanket, chatting with Josef Stalin at Yalta. Richard Nixon with Chinese 
leaders. Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a different sort of summit has come into vogue in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of meetings behind closed doors, they are high-tech teach-ins 
broadcast on cable TV with participants promoting their wish lists on how to 
fix particular problems facing the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this summit did nothing else," Assembly Speaker Willie Brown said after 
the California education summit he staged last week, "it raised the visibility 
of the education issue." 
</P>
<P>
 A week earlier, crime-fighting took center stage at Gov. Pete Wilson's summit. 
A year ago, Brown launched the latest wave of California summits by organizing 
an economic summit modeled after a highly publicized colloquium put together by 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians once formed blue-ribbon panels, task forces or commissions to 
study problems and issue reports. But in the 1990s, summits are all the rage. 
</P>
<P>
 Opinion is split on whether summits will become a permanent fixture in state 
government. Some see the gatherings as merely attention grabbing dog and pony 
shows. Others see them as a genuine way for politicians to reinvent government. 
</P>
<P>
 Sal Russo, a longtime Republican campaign consultant and former legislative 
aide, says that in the 1960s state legislators did not need a summit to 
pinpoint high priority issues because they tried to fashion solutions in a 
bipartisan spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 In his view, summits are "reflective of the deterioration of the legislative 
process" in the last 30 years. Still, he said, summits can help provide a focus 
"that used to be natural in the legislative process." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Starr, author of a series of books titled "Americans and the California 
Dream," said gridlock dominates the state legislative process, citing the 
influence of special interests, politicians' reliance on polls and the 
skittishness of legislators who believe voters will toss them out of office if 
they disagree on just a single issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, in effect, these summits are a way to get a little more freedom of speech 
into the process," Starr said. "The town hall or Chautauqua technique is used 
to bypass a Legislature that is no longer able to debate." 
</P>
<P>
 Starr, professor of urban and regional planning at USC, praised summits as a 
tool to bring issues to the state's population centers. Two have been held in 
Los Angeles and last week's convocation was in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a way to take the debate to where the power is," Starr said. "You cannot 
sit up in Sacramento and make policy (for) Greater Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 California's current adoration of summits seems unique in the nation. The 
National Conference of State Legislatures is unaware of any other state that 
has been convening such gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Brown's education summit was not the first to deal with schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, President George Bush summoned all 50 governors to meet for a two-day 
conference on public education. It was only the third time in history a U.S. 
president had called a summit conference of governors. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, in 1989, then-Gov. George Deukmejian invited 27 leaders of business, 
labor, government and the Legislature to a transportation summit meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest round of California summits are much bigger extravaganzas than 
similar gatherings in the past, complete with telephone hot lines and 
interactive TV participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a cue from Clinton's 1993 economic summit, Brown last year emceed his 
own highly publicized economic gathering in Los Angeles. The summit was 
credited with providing renewed impetus for new laws to restructure the state 
workers' compensation system and cut business taxes, both of which were hailed 
as key 1993 achievements by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 It is too early to tell what new laws will be prompted by Gov. Wilson's recent 
Hollywood summit on how to fight crime. The sessions were dominated by Wilson's 
law and order agenda, including an emphasis on building more prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 One interesting sidelight of the latest summits has been the almost gushing 
interplay between Wilson and Brown. Each seems to recognize that he needs the 
other to elevate the importance of the events. 
</P>
<P>
 At moments, the education gathering seemed to be more like the Willie and Pete 
show as the Speaker and governor, typically rivals, traded compliments. 
</P>
<P>
 At least some of Brown's staff members at the education summit hoped he will 
take a rest, passing out T-shirts emblazoned with "I survived the Education 
Summit." 
</P>
<P>
 That view was shared by Phil Perry, press secretary to Assembly Republican 
Leader Jim Brulte. Perry, having gone through three summits, asked reporters 
how many orders he could expect for the following bumper sticker: "Just Say No 
. . . to Any More Summits."

DROUGHT OF HOPE; TOWN'S PLANS FOR ECONOMIC REVIVAL NOW THREATENED BY DYING LAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN FORSTENZER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When this dusty western Nevada town realized that it could no longer depend on 
a nearby Army ammunition plant and a sagging mining industry to drive its 
economy, it turned to its one natural attraction -- Walker Lake, a few miles 
north. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades the 70-square-mile lake has attracted anglers from throughout 
Nevada, California and other states to fish for its prized Lahontan strain of 
cutthroat trout. Leaders of Hawthorne, the Mineral County seat, pinned their 
economic hopes on luring more tourists to the lodges, restaurants and casinos 
of this remote, sparsely populated desert area by capitalizing on Walker Lake's 
bountiful supply of the unusually large fish, which grow up to 40 pounds in 
prime conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 But those hopes for an economic revival are dimming. Scientists say that 
Walker Lake is dying. Within two years, the scientists say, all of the Lahontan 
cutthroats could be dead, and its remaining, non-game fish species would 
probably vanish shortly afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're coming to the point where this tremendous natural resource that we've 
taken for granted for generations is going to disappear in front of our eyes, 
and we're not going to have much of a chance of rescuing it," said Mike Sevon, 
fisheries biologist for the Nevada Division of Wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Upstream diversions of the Walker River that fed the lake are causing its 
level to drop, steadily increasing the concentration of salinity and alkalinity 
in the water. The water has been rendered so toxic for trout that their life 
spans are shortened and they no longer reach the large sizes for which they are 
famous, Sevon said. 
</P>
<P>
 He began warning about the imminent destruction of the lake's fishery more 
than a year ago. Stunned Hawthorne residents formed a committee, the Walker 
Lake Working Group, to try to save it. 
</P>
<P>
 With the ammunitions plant downsizing and several mines shutting down, 
residents worry that Mineral County, already one of the poorest counties in 
Nevada, might go bankrupt if the lake's fish die. Pickup trucks sport "Save 
Walker Lake" bumper stickers, and a poster in a shop window describes how to 
sew a square for a "Save Our Lake" quilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that about 4,200 out-of-town fishers flock to Walker Lake each 
year. That is more than half the population of Mineral County, which has about 
6,600 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the fish die," said Mineral County Commissioner Herman Staat, "that would 
really hurt because we get quite a few people from other states for fishing. 
They buy lures, fishing licenses, gas for their boat, fill up the motels, and 
it all gives a boost to the economy. We would really feel it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Walker River originates with two forks in the Eastern Sierra of California 
that join near Yerington, Nev., in Lyon County, one of the state's prime 
agricultural regions, before winding into Mineral County to the east. Over the 
years, courts have overallocated Walker River water to farmers and ranchers in 
California, Nevada and the Paiute Indian reservation just north of Walker Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in above-average rainfall years, the river system often does not hold 
enough water to satisfy all of the legal water rights held by ranchers and 
farmers. During the last seven years of mostly drought, virtually all the water 
was diverted, with none reaching the lake except for a small amount last year 
from the settlement of an unrelated lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 According to studies cited by Sevon, about 137,000 acre-feet of water per year 
is the minimum amount needed to keep Walker Lake's level from dropping lower. 
That represents more than a third of the average annual flow at the upper end 
of the river. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Hawthorne citizens group do not dispute the legal water rights 
of the upstream farmers and ranchers, but some members accuse them of wasting 
water or expanding operations at the expense of the lake. They cite a Nevada 
law under which water rights can be lost if water is not used within a certain 
period, which they say encourages waste. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that there are compromises that could be reached where they could 
divert water in Lyon County and still provide water for the lake," said Louis 
Thompson, chairman of the Walker Lake Working Group. "It would be much more 
desirable to reach a negotiated settlement, but we are prepared to go to court. 
We are bound and determined to get more water into the lake." 
</P>
<P>
 Some group members complained that all the political and economic clout lies 
upstream in Lyon County, noting that one of their state representatives is the 
Nevada Assembly Speaker, Joseph Dini of Yerington, who has opposed efforts to 
provide more water for the lake. Among those who own ranches or farms along the 
Walker River are some of Nevada's wealthy, including hotel executive Barron 
Hilton and Sparks, Nev., casino owner John Ascuaga. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sierra Club has joined the Hawthorne group's fight to keep the lake from 
dying. Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has also pledged to try to save the lake, the 
second-largest entirely within the state and a remnant of a vast 
Pleistocene-era lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Some proposed solutions include a water rights buyout, and encouraging farmers 
to switch to water conserving farming methods. But many of the proposed 
remedies could take longer to implement than the few years biologists say the 
trout might have left. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyon County farmers denied that they waste water, and said that many of them 
have switched to water saving irrigation practices. There is not enough water 
in the Walker River system to save the lake without destroying the economy of 
their area, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just had six or seven dry years, and the whole area is very dry, it's 
like a sponge," said Richard Fulstone, who owns ranching interests in Lyon 
County and eastern California and is chairman of the U.S. Board of Water 
Commissioners. "If you tried to take a consistent supply of water out of this 
area, you would devastate it. You would displace families and everything else." 
Dying Environment 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Hawthorne Nev., have depended on trout from nearby Walker Lake to 
attract fishermen and drive the local economy. But scientists say the lake's 
surface level is dropping and within two years, all of the trout could be dead.

ON CALIFORNIA: THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's this voice in my head. Anyone properly prepared for an earthquake, it 
says, is just asking to be hit by a truck. An emergency water supply is an 
invitation to a flood. Once freeways are retrofitted, subway tunnels are 
certain to collapse. Maybe a hard rain's gonna fall, but it's not gonna fall on 
me. And so on. 
</P>
<P>
 There's this other voice in my head. Wear dirty underwear, it says, and you 
can count on somehow winding up stripped to your shorts, strapped to an 
ambulance gurney, in full public view, film at 11. To drive without a spare is 
to guarantee a blowout. Pass on earthquake insurance today, live in a tent 
tomorrow. There's a fault line out there with your name on it, fool: Prepare. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone knows these voices. Sometimes they can sound an awful lot like a 
grandmother or spouse, a Caltech scientist or sidewalk preacher, Ralph Nader or 
even James Dean. What is more important, they rage back and forth, an 
earthquake kit or a good-looking corpse? What good is a battery in a world 
filled with bullets? These voices articulate a timeless, unresolvable, common 
and, when regarded from a proper distance, almost comic clash between the 
internal forces of fatalism and precaution. 
</P>
<P>
 In this battle, precaution doesn't do so well. It tends to prevail only in the 
aftermath of disaster. Volcano insurance would have been an easy sell right 
after Pompeii. Lifeboats were popular items after the Titanic. Similarly, after 
Northridge, Californians have rediscovered earthquake preparedness. This will 
pass, of course, but in the meantime it's worth a visit to Frank Wong's store 
in this town east of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The store is called the Earthquake Outlet. There are a few like it in Los 
Angeles, but up here it stands pretty much alone as a provider of one-stop 
shopping for every little thing anyone might need post-Big One. Wong stocks, 
among other items, crowbars; hand-cranked flashlights; abdominal compresses; 
portable toilets (a camouflaged cardboard job, and a plastic model called "The 
Throne"); 20-year batteries; solar radios; boxed Canadian water; heat-seeking 
fire extinguishers; prepackaged survival kits; Swiss Army knives; tow ropes; 
wire saws; "emergency towels" in a tiny can ("submerge in water for a few 
seconds/now you have a 100% cotton towel"); foundation anchors; furniture 
clasps; hard hats; freeze-dried omelets, hash and brownies; triage tags (mark 
the green box for "minor" injuries, black for "deceased"), and even body bags. 
</P>
<P>
 Has anybody ever bought one of these? I asked, pointing to one of the white 
plastic bags, priced to move at $18.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, said Wong. "People buy them to send as presents to friends who are not 
prepared. You know, like a joke." 
</P>
<P>
 Funny, people. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong came to the earthquake trade via real estate. He started the store last 
April. The earth was still, and business was bad. Wong was losing money, and by 
early January had begun to make plans to end his lease. Then came the 
Northridge quake. Then came lines of customers, and television cameras, and 
more customers. They came because they saw television shots of Angelenos lined 
up for water, or heard horror stories from Southland relatives caught 
battery-less in the darkness. The earthquake brought new energy to the old 
debate within. 
</P>
<P>
 "One guy called from Palo Alto," Wong said, "and talked in a whisper: 'Do you 
have earthquake kits? My wife's upstairs. She kept bugging me to buy an 
earthquake kit, but I never did. I told her it was in the garage. Now she wants 
to see it. Can you Fed-Ex me one?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "It will cost you," Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fed-Ex it," the man whispered back. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Wong doesn't expect this to last. Each week that passes 
post-earthquake, the average profits slip a bit more. He's not yet back to 
those dead days of early January, but he's headed in that direction. The forces 
of fatalism have regained their footing. On Monday, a young couple were looking 
over a jumbo earthquake kit on display. 
</P>
<P>
 The husband explained it simply "makes sense" to get ready: "Everyone is aware 
of the dangers that exist . . . and for a nominal amount of money you can be 
well-prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 "And I say," said the wife, "that I have managed so far not to be around in 
any of the big quakes. I've always been at the right place and the right time. 
I'm going to miss it." 
</P>
<P>
 "And I say," said the husband, "our luck has run out." 
</P>
<P>
 They said goodby and left. They had not made a purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least this gives us something to chew on," the husband said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure," the wife said, soothingly. "We can always come back." 
</P>
<P>
 I'd know those voices anywhere.

PESTICIDE MAY BE LINK TO FUMES IN BLOOD; HOSPITALS: AUTOPSY MAY REVEAL WHY 
EMERGENCY ROOM WORKERS COLLAPSED WHILE TREATING A CANCER PATIENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Toxic pesticide fumes from the blood of a cancer patient they were trying to 
save may have caused the bizarre emergency room collapse of a physician and a 
nurse in Riverside on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 But blood tests performed on the doctor and nurse left many troubling 
questions unanswered Tuesday, including how the patient, who died of a heart 
attack, could have come in contact with a pesticide and why relatives and 
paramedics who transported her to Riverside General Hospital were unaffected. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators hope some of the questions may be answered by an autopsy, 
scheduled for today on the victim, 31-year-old Gloria Ramirez. Her body is 
being stored in a sealed aluminum box to prevent further injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The two stricken emergency room workers, Dr. Julie Gorchinski and nurse Sally 
Balderas, remained hospitalized late Tuesday, with Gorchinski's condition being 
downgraded from good to fair. Four other emergency workers were treated at 
hospitals and released after the Saturday incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorchinski's blood showed evidence of exposure to organophosphates or similar 
chemicals, said spokesman Dick Schaefer of Loma Linda University Medical 
Center, where Gorchinski is being treated. Organophosphates are highly reactive 
chemicals that are the principal ingredients of the nerve gas used in chemical 
warfare, as well as in pesticides used in the home and on farms. Some household 
pesticides contain 1% to 2% organophosphates, while those used by farmers and 
exterminators contain as much as 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests of the emergency room showed no contamination in the room or adjoining 
ventilator shafts, no hazardous gases in the area and no toxic spills, 
investigator Paul Mitchell told Associated Press. "Whatever it was, it was very 
localized," and probably related to Ramirez's body, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez had been undergoing chemotherapy for ovarian cancer and had started a 
new course of therapy earlier in the week. Relatives reported that she had been 
ill since beginning the new drug and became worse Saturday night, vomiting, 
suffering chest pains and having difficulty breathing. Her fiance, Johnnie 
Estrada, called an ambulance, but was not allowed to accompany her to the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez was alert and vomiting when she arrived, Balderas told the Riverside 
Press-Enterprise, but shortly thereafter went into full cardiac arrest. "She 
had this film on her body, like you see on the ground at a gas station," 
Balderas said. 
</P>
<P>
 When one of the nurses began withdrawing a blood sample from Ramirez, the 
workers reported an ammonia-like smell. The blood sample also seemed to be 
contaminated with white crystals. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost immediately after they began drawing blood, "the nurses just started 
fainting," Balderas said. "I was putting them on gurneys, starting IVs, and 
moving them to the parking lot. I also moved the victim from the trauma room to 
the isolation room." Balderas collapsed 15 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the workers' symptoms suggested poisoning by cyanide or strychnine, 
tests on their blood showed no traces of such chemicals, Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts said it is highly unlikely that the cancer chemotherapy was to blame 
for the incident, although Dr. Nir Kossovsky of UCLA conceded that "there is 
always the possibility of something being wrong" with one of the medications. 
But he noted that he had never heard of a chemotherapy patient's blood giving 
off noxious fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 A remarkably similar case occurred three years ago in Perth, Australia, when a 
man who had attempted suicide by swallowing four tablets of Phostoxin -- an 
organophosphate used to kill weevils in silos -- was brought into a hospital 
emergency room. Fumes from his body felled emergency room workers and forced 
the evacuation not only of that emergency room, but of a second where some 
victims were taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Riverside case, paramedics who transported the patients were also 
affected by the fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Kossovsky ruled out the possibility that malathion spraying in Riverside 
County last week was linked to the incident, noting that other organophosphates 
"are far more reactive." Support for that hypothesis comes from an incident two 
years ago in which a Bakersfield man who attempted suicide by swallowing 
malathion and chlordane vomited the pesticides in a hospital emergency room 
without harm to any workers.

MEXICAN TROOPS GUILTY OF ABUSE, 2 JURISTS REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The International Commission of Jurists said Tuesday that Mexican troops 
committed serious human rights abuses in trying to put down a peasant uprising 
in Chiapas last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The accusation came in a preliminary report by a mission of two Latin American 
lawyers sent by the respected Geneva-based body earlier this month to 
investigate the situation in the southern state following the rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Government troops were guilty of serious violations of human rights," said a 
summary of the report issued by the commission, which has a membership of 45 
lawyers around the world and aims to defend the rule of law. 
</P>
<P>
 "These violations included: summary executions of prisoners, some of whom had 
been wounded before their capture; the arbitrary detention of perhaps more than 
200 civilians, torture and other forms of abuse," the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report was issued as peace talks were under way in the Chiapas capital of 
San Cristobal de las Casas between rebel leaders and Mexican government envoys. 
</P>
<P>
 The two commission lawyers, Alejandro Artucio of Uruguay and Eduard Duhalde of 
Argentina, said in the report that they feared people may have been kidnaped by 
the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 There were approximately 20 people whose whereabouts were unknown, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report estimated that between 200 and 300 people died in the 10 days of 
fighting after the rebels seized several towns in the region Jan. 1. The 
conflict was rooted in extreme poverty and discrimination against the 
indigenous population, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two lawyers said that during 10 days in Chiapas and in Mexico City from 
Feb. 1 through Feb. 10, they received no complaints of abuses against civilians 
by the insurgents' Zapatista National Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also recorded that they received "generous cooperation and support" 
from the Mexican government and local authorities.

 Ever since the 1700s, when Winchester was on the frontier of the Far West, the 
Shenandoah Valley has been a place where people lived with guns. They were part 
of manhood and citizenry, and even today, you'll hardly find a home that 
doesn't have a shotgun oiled and ready for the grouse season -- and perhaps an 
heirloom rifle or two in a closet, forgotten behind the vacuum cleaner and 
winter coats. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, respect for guns runs deep. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Blye, who sells guns and jewelry from his shop on Winchester's Loundon 
Street, collects military weapons, from which he has learned about history and 
craftsmanship and adventure. Twice a week all through the winter you'll find 
Toby Warren, shotgun in hand, on some mountainside in pursuit of grouse. Bird 
hunting, he knows, is one of the rewards God saved for man. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the border in West Virginia, insurance agent Bill Miller has 20 guns at 
home, secured in a locked steel case. His passion is target shooting at a 
nearby range. 
</P>
<P>
 It is to these people that President Clinton appealed in his State of the 
Union Address when he called for a ban on assault weapons. He said he 
understood their culture, one that he grew up with himself. "I say to you, I 
know you didn't create this (crime) problem, but we need your help to solve 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 But to many Americans, gun ownership is a big part of the problem. One in 
three Americans identifies crime as the major problem facing the United States. 
According to a recent Times Mirror Poll, 57% of Americans now believe that 
controlling guns is more important than protecting the right to own them. 
</P>
<P>
 As deaths from firearms and violent crime rates rise, gun owners increasingly 
are feeling a sting of public disapproval akin to the scorn that drove smokers 
outdoors and curbed sales of fur coats. 
</P>
<P>
 Blye, Warren and Miller are three of the 65 million Americans who own the 210 
million guns in the nation. Like most rural Americans, they treat their weapons 
with reverence and are perplexed by the epidemic of crime and the reaction it 
is spawning. They sense that their way of life is threatened, by mayhem in the 
streets of Washington, D.C., just a two-hour drive down Route 50, and by the 
growing calls for firearms restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the voices calling for responsible gun ownership and public 
understanding of what that means. 
</P>
<P>
 Blye considers it a great injustice that responsible gun dealers should be 
held accountable for the violence in our cities. "You don't blame the fire on 
the match," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the people I sell guns to I've known for years, so there's no 
problem. But someone I don't know wants to buy a gun, first thing I do is try 
and determine their attitude," Blye says. "If there's any hint they might not 
be stable or there's reason to question their character, I refuse them. Women 
come in wanting a handgun for self-defense, and if they've never picked up a 
gun before, I try and talk them into pepper gas instead." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren, a farmer and former schoolteacher, remembers when, in the 1950s, at 
age 15, he sent $36 off to the Golden State Arms company in California and 
received by return mail, no questions asked, a .45 semiautomatic handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody, deranged or otherwise, could buy a gun in those days," he says, "but 
people didn't abuse gun ownership then like they do today. Guns are just tools, 
dangerous tools like chain saws, and we were brought up understanding that." 
</P>
<P>
 In his spare time, Warren teaches firearm safety. To ensure that his young 
students comprehend the finality of their actions, he begins each new class by 
placing a pumpkin on the ground, six feet away. He squeezes off a shotgun 
round. The pumpkin explodes, leaving nothing but scattered clumps of pulp. "The 
kids," he says, "never forget that. Never." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller is teaching his 6-year-old son how to handle and shoot a .22 rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Learning to respect guns and use them properly isn't an isolated thing," 
Miller says. "It's just an element of what you learn growing up -- like 
discipline, doing your chores, taking responsibility for your own actions. It's 
what I call citizenry. But I'm not sure kids today are learning those lessons 
as well as we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Among such gun fanciers, the fact that more and more guns are in the wrong 
hands is alarming. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sensitive to the fact that the majority of people who have handguns today 
shouldn't, and with the way things are going in our cities, I'm not sure that 
confiscating all handguns isn't a good idea," said Jim Wilder, a computer 
program analyst who keeps a 9-millimeter Taurus semiautomatic pistol on the top 
closet shelf of his Alexandria, Va., apartment. "The only gun I wouldn't want 
to see confiscated, though, is mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilder finds the romance between man and his gun in our society "mystifying 
and a little spooky." Many historians believe that it stems from our Colonial 
heritage as a militia society and from our frontier days when citizens armed 
themselves in situations of social conflict to enforce vigilante justice that 
preceded the arrival of a resident sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, America has some very special attitudes toward gun use," said 
historian Richard Slotkin, author of "Gunfighter Nation." "The key one, I 
think, is that we have come to the view that you are allowed to use a gun for 
private purposes, for self-defense or whatever, as opposed to the notion in 
militia societies like Israel and Switzerland where you are entrusted with that 
gun by society for social purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 But that concept of self-defense is critical to gun owners such as Wilder and 
Phil Murphy. Murphy, who lives in Tucson and legally carries a .45 revolver in 
his car, has twice faced down burglars breaking into his parents' home. The 
last one he held at bay with his Colt Sporter rifle was 19 years old and had a 
rap sheet with 34 felonies. Murphy said the officers who responded to his 911 
call to make the arrest treated him not as "a crazed gunslinger" but as "a 
citizen who recognizes his responsibility to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 "Law-abiding gun owners are the only ones you can count on in a crisis," 
Murphy said. He cites Tian An Men Square as an example of what can happen when 
the populace is disarmed. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing controversy over whether the freedom to own guns has limits has 
led to a substantial growth in the National Rifle Assn., which now claims 3.3 
million members. But the NRA's strict ideological interpretation of the Second 
Amendment and its belief that guns have no more relevance to the soaring crime 
rate than watermelons has nudged the organization, in the eyes of many gun 
owners, into the fringes of extremism. Only about one in 20 gun owners and one 
in six hunters are NRA members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the NRA has fallen out of step with society," said former member Dick 
Murphy, a retired Army officer and two-tour Vietnam veteran. Once each autumn, 
he drives from his North Carolina home to a primitive lakeside cabin in Maine, 
where he hunts for two weeks. "Personally, the idea of having to register my 
guns wouldn't bother me a bit. I have to register my car, don't I?" 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall a group of gun owners, many of them former military officers, split 
from the NRA and founded the American Firearms Assn. as a moderate voice for 
the gun lobby. Ernest Lissabet, president of the Virginia-based organization, 
said the AFA supports the constitutional right of law-abiding Americans to own 
firearms but also believes that "common-sense legislation" is needed to limit 
the "weapons of war" on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arming the entire populace may have made sense in 1776, but I'm not sure it's 
entirely a good idea today," said Lissabet, a park ranger and skeet shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 Lissabet noted: "The NRA says, 'It's the criminals, stupid,' and I say, 'Yes 
it is, but it's also the guns they have.' They say, 'Well, they get them from 
illegal sources,' and I say, 'True, but when we have some common-sense 
legislation, over the long run, not the short run, it will begin to put the 
squeeze on that source.' Let's not forget that, as gun owners, we're still a 
minority in this country."

NOLAN PLEA PROMPTS DELAY IN CORRUPTION TRIAL OF STATE SENATOR, AIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal court judge Tuesday delayed the political corruption trial of state 
Sen. Frank Hill (R-Whittier) and former legislative aide Terry E. Frost until 
May 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill and Frost were originally set to go to trial on March 21, along with 
their co-defendant, Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale). 
</P>
<P>
 But last week Nolan pleaded guilty to racketeering and resigned his office. 
The former Assembly GOP leader is due to report to federal prison March 28, 
when he will begin serving a 33-month sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Hill and Frost contend that publicity from Nolan's guilty plea 
would hurt their clients' chances for a fair trial.

JUSTICE DEPT. MOVES TO PROTECT BLACK VOTING DISTRICTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Justice Department acted Tuesday to protect black-majority congressional 
districts that face private legal challenges in Georgia, North Carolina and 
Texas and said it is considering similar action in a Florida case. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department moved to intervene and join the state of Georgia in 
defending a challenge to the constitutionality of the boundaries of the 11th 
District of black Democratic Rep. Cynthia McKinney. 
</P>
<P>
 It decided to file friend-of-the-court briefs in similar cases in North 
Carolina, where the 12th District, represented by Democrat Melvin Watt, has 
been challenged and in Texas, where the 18th District of black Democrat Craig 
Washington and the 29th District of Democratic Rep. Gene Green have been 
attacked as unconstitutional. The 29th was designed as a Latino district, 
although Green, who is not Latino, won the 1992 election in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "This department is committed to protecting minority voting rights gains that 
were achieved through redistricting after the 1990 Census," Atty. Gen. Janet 
Reno said. "Our actions today will help ensure that the clock is not turned 
back and that those gains are not undone." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, President Clinton added: "These hard-won victories must not be 
abandoned." 
</P>
<P>
 Reno's announcement and Clinton's statement, however, failed to reassure 
members of the Congressional Black Caucus and other minority leaders who said 
that even stronger action is necessary to preserve African American and Latino 
gains achieved as a result of redistricting for the 1992 elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think she (Reno) should intervene in all of the cases," said Rep. Cleo 
Fields (D-La.), whose z-shaped district in Louisiana has been ruled 
unconstitutional by a three-judge federal court. The Justice Department filed a 
friend-of-the-court brief in his case, which is now being appealed to the U.S. 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Justice Department must step up to the line and defend the Voting Rights 
Act," Fields added. 
</P>
<P>
 Intervention, the step selected by the Justice Department in the Georgia case, 
would make the U.S. government a full participant, allowing federal attorneys 
more leeway to dig out facts and examine witnesses during trial. 
Friend-of-the-court briefs merely express the Justice Department's position on 
the legal issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The department said that it is considering entering a court case challenging 
the lines drawn for the 3rd District in northern Florida, which is represented 
by black Democrat Corrine Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials said that each lawsuit involves different circumstances 
and defended the different approaches as appropriate legal ways to defend the 
redrawn district lines, which were designed to provide adequate minority 
representation.

COMPETING PEACE PLANS CONSIDERED; DIPLOMACY: AGREEMENT PROVES ELUSIVE AS WORLD 
LEADERS DISCUSS BUILDING ON SARAJEVO SUCCESS. RISK IS OF ONLY A TEMPORARY 
RESPITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 World leaders from Washington to Moscow picked their way through a thicket of 
competing ideas about how to apply the lessons of Sarajevo to other war-torn 
cities Tuesday but found they could not even agree on what caused Bosnian Serb 
militias to stop shelling the Bosnian capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The muddle, if not resolved soon, could limit the impact of the Sarajevo 
cease-fire and risk making it no more than a temporary respite in the bitter 
ethnic conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bonn, diplomats from the United States, Russia, the European Union, Canada 
and the United Nations discussed ways to build on the Sarajevo cease-fire but 
made no firm decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 They spoke favorably about a French proposal to seek Sarajevo-style truces in 
other U.N.-designated "safe areas" -- the cities of Tuzla, Srebrenica, Zepa, 
Gorazde and Bihac. But at Russia's insistence, the diplomats said that the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization should not threaten air strikes against 
Bosnian Serb forces surrounding the other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bonn meeting underlined a basic disagreement between the United States and 
its NATO allies on one side and Russia on the other over what prompted the 
Serbs to withdraw or surrender most of their guns surrounding Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 In NATO's view, that would have never happened without the threat of air 
strikes. But Russia, which adamantly opposes NATO bombing, insists it was 
Russian diplomacy that persuaded the Serbs to pull back. 
</P>
<P>
 Even among the Western allies, there was no agreement on when or how to take 
the next step. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration called for at least a brief period of consolidation 
to make sure that the Sarajevo cease-fire will hold before turning to 
additional steps. Defense Secretary William J. Perry warned that it might yet 
become necessary to bomb Bosnian Serb positions around Sarajevo, and he made it 
clear that he is in no hurry to take on a similar responsibility for other 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you how relieved I am that we did not need to call on those 
young men to go on those air strikes," Perry told the House Armed Services 
Committee. "But the mission is not yet over. We may still need to call on 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 "The success of the NATO ultimatum regarding Sarajevo came in part because it 
was a very specific mission tasked very effectively by military planners," said 
State Department spokesman Mike McCurry. "We're in a position now where we are 
trying to consolidate those gains that have occurred around Sarajevo and then 
figure out how you branch out from that." 
</P>
<P>
 At the United Nations, officials said that there is an urgent need for more 
peacekeeping troops, especially if there is an attempt to stop shelling in 
other areas of Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to underline in the strongest possible terms the need for more troops, 
particularly if we move into areas and try to stop the shelling," said Joe 
Sills, the spokesman for Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. 
</P>
<P>
 Sills said that Kofi Annan of Ghana, the U.N. undersecretary general for 
peacekeeping, had asked for 2,500 more troops. So far, no nation has indicated 
that it is ready to provide the soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting in Bonn was hastily brokered by German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel in an attempt to take advantage of the Sarajevo cease-fire and explore 
areas where Russia and the major Western countries could cooperate in bringing 
peace to Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 In a formal statement issued after the meeting, the diplomats unanimously 
backed a European Union plan that would effectively divide Bosnia into Serbian, 
Croatian and Muslim regions as the basis for a diplomatic settlement and agreed 
that the Muslims need "qualitative" improvements to the region proposed for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 All sides in the conflict have given at least grudging approval to that 
formula, but the negotiations have broken down over the changes demanded by the 
Muslims. 
</P>

 Times staff writers Tyler Marshall in Brussels and Doyle McManus and Stanley 
Meisler in Washington contributed to this report.

NEWS ANALYSIS; RECALLING BROKEN PROMISES OVER PAST 2 YEARS, SARAJEVANS 
SKEPTICAL; BOSNIA: BUT RESIDENTS ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE TRUCE. THEY CAN ONLY HOPE 
AND PRAY IT WILL LAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Whether the peace that now reigns in Sarajevo can be preserved and extended 
elsewhere in war-racked Bosnia depends on how long the world powers that have 
created it are willing to stand watch over a costly end game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Serb artillery that savaged this multicultural city for more than 
22 months has been rendered silent, because the gunners sensed for the first 
time in this conflict that the Western countries of the NATO alliance were 
serious about striking back. 
</P>
<P>
 But much of the weaponry remains within easy reach of the Serbian besiegers, 
either still dug into the surrounding hills now watched over by token and 
temporary U.N. patrols or at new venues outside the protective 12-mile zone 
delineated around Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 The silencing of the artillery cordon has been proclaimed a major success by 
U.N. officials here, and many capital residents share the West's appreciation 
for that genuine breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there is unshakable skepticism on the part of most Bosnians toward Western 
assurances that the horrors of war are nearly over here, and much of that doubt 
has been instilled by nearly two years of broken promises of military or moral 
support to break the siege. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of U.N. peacekeeping operations, Kofi Annan, has repeated the world 
body's urgent appeal for 2,500 more troops to reinforce the cease-fire and 
weapons-monitoring patrols for Sarajevo. U.N. Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali has backed the call with a warning to member countries that more 
resources are needed for Bosnia if momentum toward peace and a credible threat 
of enforcement are to be maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 1,000 U.N. troops on peacekeeping assignments elsewhere in the troubled 
Balkans had to be rushed to Sarajevo last week to provide the armed strength to 
enforce the NATO-ordered weapons withdrawal and cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Their absence from other hot spots, such as the central Bosnian town of Vitez 
and Serb-occupied areas of Croatia, has made those areas vulnerable to 
stepped-up conflict, adding to the pressure for more U.N. troops. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that major troop-contributing nations are speaking more of pulling 
out than of reinforcing their Bosnian contingents is a major source of 
insecurity and fears here that bombardment could one day haunt Sarajevo again. 
</P>
<P>
 "The war still isn't over here," said Drazenka Kravic, a dejected young mother 
selling slices of a homemade cake at the central market. "Even when the rest of 
the world thinks there is peace, there won't be. They don't see that it is a 
pause that will end as soon as they stop looking." 
</P>
<P>
 With NATO's acceptance of an imperfect Serbian compliance with its ultimatum 
to withdraw all heavy weapons from around Sarajevo, the threat of Western 
intervention in the form of punitive air strikes has greatly receded. 
</P>
<P>
 The commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia, British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, has 
laid his credibility on the line by pressing NATO to hold off strict 
enforcement as long as the guns still inside the exclusion zone remain silent. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose's gamble and a similar one by Russia's special envoy to the Balkans, 
Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly Churkin, will likely pay off in continued peace 
here as long as the Serbs are made to feel that swift punishment will follow 
any breach of the cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 But concern is widespread that the recent U.N. actions to shore up the 
cease-fire will do more to cement the status quo of division in Sarajevo than 
to provide a formula that can be exported to other areas of Bosnia still under 
siege. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelling here may have stopped, and the risk of death may have been 
removed from an act as simple as walking downtown streets in daylight. But the 
city remains under blockade by the Serbian forces who encircle it and bar any 
flow of goods and people in or out of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Water taps and power lines remain in the hands of the Bosnian Serb forces who 
have sought to conquer Sarajevo for inclusion in an ethnically pure state 
built, acre by acre, through armed force and strategic deprivation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopes for relief were raised Tuesday when the Office of the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees resumed aid convoys and the lifesaving food airlift 
to Sarajevo after a two-day suspension. The refugee agency also sent back in 
dozens of foreign staff workers who had been evacuated last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sarajevans hunger for the time that they will not be dependent on U.N. 
handouts for their survival and can restore normal trade and social ties with 
the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. mission has identified several potential next steps following the 
Sarajevo cease-fire, most of which involve fully enforcing the exclusion zone 
but some of which are also aimed at allowing free movement for the capital's 
380,000 remaining citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Col. Bill Aikman, U.N. mission spokesman in Bosnia, said restoration of 
utilities and removal of barricades are top priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian government leaders have publicly accepted the U.N. promises that other 
steps to lifting the siege will be taken, apparently confident that the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization can be compelled to brandish the threat of air 
strikes again if needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic expressed uncharacteristic confidence that 
the international community will follow through, noting that the very success 
of the NATO ultimatum in forcing the Serbs to silence their guns has provided 
proof positive to Western societies that they can make a difference here 
without risk to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have received assurances by the U.N. that they will try to immediately 
help refugees return to their homes," Ganic said when asked if the planned 
deployment of thousands more troops here to patrol Serb- and government-held 
areas would secure the territorial status quo, as has happened during two years 
of U.N. intervention in Serb-occupied Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope (U.N. troops) won't now be employed by the Serbs to keep the territory 
they have conquered, like they did in Croatia," Ganic said. "We will not accept 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 But efforts to build on the achievement of the Sarajevo cease-fire will likely 
be met with firm Serbian resistance, at least at the onset, leaving the capital 
at the mercy of its former attackers while lengthy negotiations ensue. 
</P>
<P>
 A protracted standoff would likely encourage government forces outside 
Sarajevo to take it upon themselves to end the blockade by advancing through 
the Serbian cordon that has ostensibly been stripped of its heavy weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the nightmare scenario for many in Bosnia, as it would compel Serbian 
rebels to seize back the weapons only nominally under U.N. control, reigniting 
the artillery clash that has been halted for the past 11 days. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rose has been struggling to convince all involved in this faceoff that his 
success in stopping the shelling will be lasting and that his optimism is not 
based solely on the naive hopes of a newcomer. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose's accomplishments in little more than three weeks on the job were 
possible because NATO sought to capitalize on the international outrage sparked 
by the Feb. 5 bombing of an open-air market that killed 68. 
</P>
<P>
 If he is to deter any repeat of that horror and avoid becoming the West's fall 
guy on Bosnia, Rose will have to keep the pressure on the international 
community to make good on its promises to keep the guns silent and gradually 
restore some semblance of normal life to this battered country. What's Ahead 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the options being considered for Bosnia now that the situation in 
Sarajevo has cooled: 
</P>
<P>
 OPTION: Put Sarajevo under U. N. administration (proposed by Russia, France) 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK: The Bosnians have said they would accept U.N. administration if it 
didn't dilute their sovereignty over their own capital. 
</P>
<P>
 OPTION: Force a cease fire in Mostar (proposed by the U.N. commander in 
Sarajevo) 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK: The United States was wary about issuing another threat. U.N. 
negotiators say they are close to negotiating a cease-fire without any explicit 
threats of force. 
</P>
<P>
 OPTION: Extend new Sarajevo-style protection to the five other "safe areas." 
(proposed by France) 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK: The United States and Russia both oppose the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 OPTION: Hold an international peace conference (proposed by Germany and 
Russia) 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK: The United States and most other countries, pessimistic about chances 
for success, have said such a meeting would be premature. 
</P>
<P>
 OPTION: Take a few limited steps, such as reopening Tuzla airport or relieving 
Canadian peacekeeping troops in Srebrenica (proposed by United States as a 
fallback) 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK: The United Nations says it plans to reopen Tuzla airport March 7 and 
relieve the Canadians as soon is practicable. 
</P>
<P>
 OPTION: Spur Muslim-Croat diplomatic talks on combining their areas into a 
single state (proposed by United States)

REJECTING FREE VOTE, WHITE S. AFRICANS LAY CLAIM TO 2 TOWNS

 Armed white right-wing demonstrators driving in convoys laid claim to two 
towns Tuesday to dramatize their bid for a separate homeland and their 
rejection of the country's first free elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Just hours after the government and the African National Congress said they 
had met most demands of white conservatives planning to boycott the elections, 
the armed protesters drove through Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State and 
Newcastle in northern Natal to bolster their demands for the towns as part of a 
future Afrikaner homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of right-wing whites has vowed to go to war to establish a homeland 
rather than fall under the rule of a black majority government, which is widely 
expected to win the elections, set for April 26-28. 
</P>
<P>
 The extremists say taking part in the elections would legitimize a flawed 
constitution.

IT'S BABUSHKAS VS. CAPITALIST GIANT AND THE WESTERN WAY; RUSSIA: FIRED 
HOUSEKEEPERS SUE RADISSON-RUN HOTEL FOR MILLIONS. TEST OF OLD LABOR LAWS GETS 
HEADLINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ludmilla V. Gubareva once belonged to the ranks of Russia's invisible women: 
the army of long-suffering middle-aged babushkas who scrub, sweep, mop and even 
shovel snow but get neither good wages nor respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the pleasant, plump, 54-year-old charwoman and her 59-year-old sister are 
suing the American-managed Radisson Slavayanskaya Hotel for wrongful dismissal. 
They have astounded their downtrodden countrywomen by demanding $10 million 
each in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I thought I was worth," Gubareva said as she waited Tuesday in a 
dingy courtroom still emblazoned with the Soviet slogan, "Proletarians of the 
world, unite!" 
</P>
<P>
 The case of the two sacked sisters versus the capitalist hotel giant has 
grabbed headlines here. Some see it as a precedent-setting test of Russia's 
Soviet-era labor law, which made it nearly impossible to fire incompetent 
workers and is now under pressure from Western-style management that wants to 
reward good employees and punish loafers. 
</P>
<P>
 But as unemployment rises, older people and unskilled workers in particular 
worry that they may end up as wage slaves to Western imperialists, with no 
benefits or job security. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the court battle looks like a draw. 
</P>
<P>
 Gubareva's sister, Tamara Yashchina, won a victory early this month when the 
Kievsky District People's Court ordered her reinstated in her old job cleaning 
the kitchen of the four-star hotel where President Clinton stayed during his 
trip to Moscow last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The court also ordered the Radisson to pay $94 in back wages that Yashchina 
claimed she was owed after the hotel did not renew her one-year employment 
contract. The split decision displeased both sides and is being appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 The women claim they were never told that their job performance was 
unsatisfactory or given a chance to improve before they were canned. The hotel 
says the women had a history of bad job appraisals and that, as a result, they 
were not paid a hard-currency bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian labor law allows employers to dismiss workers only for such offenses 
as tardiness, truancy or coming to work drunk. It does not make allowances for 
such subjective criteria as whether an employee is nice to the customers, said 
Vladimir Draitser, general director of the Russian-American joint venture that 
runs the hotel and an adjoining business center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Smiles, friendliness -- these are concepts that are just unknown in Soviet 
labor standards," Draitser said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reforms will never go anywhere" unless Russian labor law embraces a 
merit-based system, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gubareva said her problems started after she and her sister defended another 
cleaning woman who they believed had been fired without cause. Gubareva, a 
former building engineer who once supervised 134 people, believes she would 
still have her job if she were younger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course they would rather hire a young person than me," she said. But "I 
was not afraid of hard work. When you realize it is necessary, you do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Still a year away from receiving a pension, Gubareva says she cannot find 
another job and has been selling her jewelry to scrape by. 
</P>
<P>
 She has already waited more than a year for her day in court, but a 
long-delayed hearing scheduled for Tuesday was postponed again indefinitely, 
because the judge was ill. Draitser said the women are trying to take advantage 
of deep American pockets. Their attitude is, "If these are rich imperialists, 
let's go after them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel settled out of court with two other fired cleaners, Draitser said, 
but the two sisters refused to settle, instead upping their demands from 
$50,000 to $10 million as the case proceeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian labor experts are divided as to whether the existing law inhibits 
free-market business development. 
</P>
<P>
 Economist Gennady S. Lisichkin, head of the Assistance to Entrepreneurs Assn., 
noted that the legal system is in such turmoil that some pre- perestroika 
entrepreneurs are still in prison for "economic crimes." He said the sisters' 
case shows the "colossal discrepancy" between the market ideology espoused by 
the new Russia and the Communist values on which current labor laws are based. 
</P>
<P>
 Western businesses are unlikely to invest in Russia if they are forced to keep 
unacceptable workers, Lisichkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers may fire a worker for incompetence if the trade union consents and 
can appeal to a court if the trade union refuses, said Semyon A. Ivanov, who 
argues against dismantling hard-won worker protections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some labor experts now think that to really boost free enterprise in Russia, 
trade union control must be totally abolished," Ivanov said. "I cannot agree." 
</P>
<P>
 In Soviet days, the discrepancy between what the state promised and how 
workers lived was sharp enough to prompt the popular saying "We pretend to 
work, and they pretend to pay us." 
</P>
<P>
 Now some workers can earn substantial free-market salaries, but labor 
activists say they are also more vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Using the fear of unemployment, managers -- whether at private or state 
enterprises -- are tyrannizing their workers," said Sergei N. Ryzhov, chief 
workers' rights defender at the trade union that has taken up Gubareva's case. 
</P>
<P>
 Worker safety has deteriorated as cash-strapped factories cut corners, Ryzhov 
said, and traditional unions are being dissolved in favor of alternative 
organizations that are often slavishly pro-management.

ON CLINTON'S BLACKBOARD: 7 STEPS FOR EDUCATION; POLICY: THE PRESIDENT OUTLINES 
HIS AGENDA FOR 'LIFELONG LEARNING.' HIS PROPOSALS COME AMID CRITICISM THAT HE 
REMAINED SILENT TOO LONG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Deflecting criticism that he has largely ignored education, President Clinton 
Tuesday outlined his Administration's seven-step strategy for "lifelong 
learning" to reinvigorate the country and prepare it for the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we really want America to grow jobs and to increase earnings, we will have 
to dramatically improve the levels of education of the American people," 
Clinton told higher education administrators at a conference of the American 
Council on Education. 
</P>
<P>
 With the speech, his most comprehensive on the subject as President, Clinton 
clearly sought to dispel the notion that he had forgotten one of his top 
campaign subjects. Education Secretary Richard W. Riley said the speech "was a 
clear statement that education is back from the dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Education provided Clinton with some of his major achievements as Arkansas 
governor. Although Clinton advanced several education initiatives during his 
first year as President, he had not stitched all the pieces together in a major 
address. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was waiting for the right time to make his personal move," Riley said in 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The speech came as several of Clinton's education initiatives stood at 
critical junctures. Bills to establish the first national academic standards 
and encourage states to set up school-based apprenticeship programs are in 
House-Senate conference committees, and the House will soon consider 
legislation aimed at improving education for poor children. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the Administration's measures in Congress grumbled that the 
President's speech would have been more effective several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would have helped tremendously if he had set out his agenda 
early," said Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles). "If he had put some muscle 
behind it, we could have had some real advances in education." 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech, the President made it clear how each initiative fit into his 
new vision for education in America, and he linked these programs with his 
plans to restructure the unemployment system to stress retraining workers for 
new jobs. His seven steps: 
</P>
<P>
 * Help every child begin school healthy and ready to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 * Set and achieve world-class standards in public education. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make it possible for every able high school graduate to go to college. 
</P>
<P>
 * Create a domestic peace corps for young people to earn money for their 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 * Provide new apprenticeship programs for young people going from high school 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
 * Change the unemployment system into a re-employment system by instituting 
retraining and job placement programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Challenge every sector of society to accept greater responsibility for 
achieving an environment of lifelong learning. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 19th Century, Clinton said, young Americans needed at most a high 
school education to ensure good earnings. A college education became essential 
during the 20th Century, he said, and "in the 21st Century, our people will 
have to keep learning all their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed to a colorful graph showing that average yearly earnings in 1992 
for Americans with four years of college were $11,000 above the average for 
high school graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason Clinton has not needed to devote much time to this part of his 
domestic agenda is that it has broad support from both parties in Congress, 
said William Galston, a deputy assistant to the President for domestic policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Education experts stressed that although Clinton has not used his bully pulpit 
very much to push education reform, he has shown in other ways that the issue 
is a priority.

SUIT CLAIMS U.S. FAILS TO PROTECT DELTA SMELT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A coalition of nine environmental and commercial fishing organizations sued 
the U.S. Interior Department on Tuesday, charging that the federal government 
has failed to adequately protect a tiny threatened fish that inhabits the San 
Francisco Bay and Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. 
</P>
<P>
 The delta smelt, a translucent, finger-size fish, live only in the bay-delta 
estuary, which provides much of the water consumed in Southern California 
cities and Central Valley farms. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition, which includes the Sierra Club, United Anglers and the Bay 
Institute, is trying to force the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to designate 
and protect critical habitat -- the areas considered crucial for survival of 
the smelt. If critical habitat is named, it is likely the state would have to 
reduce the volume of water pumped from the bay and delta to cities and farms. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal wildlife officials said Tuesday that they were surprised by the 
lawsuit, which came on the eve of the first public hearing on the Clinton 
Administration's controversial proposal to set standards for restoring water to 
the bay-delta. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the meeting in Fresno today, the federal government will seek 
comments in Sacramento and San Francisco this week and in Irvine on Monday.

BUMPED AIRLINE PASSENGERS CAN SUE, HIGH COURT AGREES; TRANSPORTATION: JUSTICES 
REFUSE TO HEAR APPEAL FROM NORTHWEST AIRLINES. MONTANA LAWYER HAD SOUGHT 
$60,000 AFTER LOSING HIS SEAT ON A FLIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a setback for the airline industry, the Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed 
passengers who are involuntarily bumped from a scheduled flight to sue the 
carrier for damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Without comment, the justices refused to hear an appeal from Northwest 
Airlines, which claimed that 50,000 passengers a year now will be free to seek 
money in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled that 
federal law governing the airlines does not preempt such lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, when a flight is oversold, the carrier seeks volunteers who will 
accept free tickets in exchange for taking a later flight. But the federal 
rules also note: "The passenger may decline the payment and seek to recover 
damages in a court of law or in some other manner." 
</P>
<P>
 William D. West, a Montana lawyer, chose to take the latter route. On Oct. 7, 
1986, he arrived at the airport in Great Falls with a ticket and reserved seat 
on a flight to Washington. But overnight, Northwest Airlines had switched from 
a Boeing 727 to a smaller DC-9, with the result that the flight was badly 
overbooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwest offered West compensation and a seat on a later flight, but he chose 
to file a damage suit. He sought $10,000 in regular damages and $50,000 extra 
to punish the airline. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, his case has been tied up in litigation while the courts have 
sought to resolve the question of whether such lawsuits are allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Just two years ago, the high court cast doubt on any such damage suits 
involving the airlines. In the case of Morales vs. TWA, it rejected a move by 
state prosecutors to sue airlines for deceptive ads. In that decision, the 
justices suggested that the federal Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 preempts 
any state interference in the airline business. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, the justices also sent West's case back to the 9th Circuit. But 
the appeals court reaffirmed its ruling and the case came back to the high 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's refusal to hear an appeal in the case (Northwest Airlines vs. 
West, 93-803) does not set a national precedent. However, the ruling becomes 
law within the 9th Circuit, which includes California. The action also clears 
West's case for a trial to set damages. 
</P>
<P>
 More bad news may be in the offing for the airlines. Recently, the Illinois 
Supreme Court cleared the way for a damage suit by passengers irked about 
changes in the "frequent flier" program offered by American Airlines. The 
carrier has asked the high court to declare that such suits are preempted, but 
Monday's action casts doubt on that appeal too. 
</P>
<P>
 In another action, the court refused to reopen lawsuits over Agent Orange, the 
Vietnam War-era defoliant (Ivy vs. Diamond Shamrock, 93-860). In 1984, a 
federal judge in New York created a $180-million fund to settle all claims, but 
some Texas plaintiffs sought to file a new suit on the grounds that their 
illnesses arose after 1984.

<P>
 A mother was charged with incinerating her two children Tuesday in the back 
seat of her car as it was parked outside her in-laws' house. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Montalvo, 29, was charged with two counts of murder and one count of 
aggravated arson for the deaths of her 28-month-old son, Rafael Aponte, and 
18-month-old daughter, Zonaida Aponte. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Montalvo had recently fought with her husband and may have 
been suicidal. 
</P>
<P>
 Montalvo bought a container of gasoline as she drove the children from their 
home to her in-laws' house, said Robert Honecker, a Monmouth County prosecutor. 
"The car exploded in flames" after she got out, he said.

'IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF WHEN,' FRIENDS SAY; VIOLENCE: CHRISTOPHER GOLLY HAD 
MANY FIGHTS WITH HIS FATHER AND HAD DEVELOPED A DRUG HABIT, ACCORDING TO A 
GROUP OF YOUTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A portrait of a disturbed, drug abusing teen-ager who had previously talked of 
killing his father emerged Tuesday in the hours after police say the youth shot 
his father, a rookie police officer and finally himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends described 17-year-old Christopher Golly as a quiet youth and an 
undisciplined student who had developed a daily habit of snorting crystal 
Methedrine, a highly addictive form of amphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was into speed pretty bad," said James Carieri, 18, a friend in a tightly 
knit group of teen-agers who met at Granada Hills High School, where Chris was 
a student until May. "It made him really pumped, really amped. I also think it 
messed up his head because sometimes he was on the crazy side." 
</P>
<P>
 During the last few months, Chris told several close friends that he had been 
on the verge of killing his father and only stopped himself because he was too 
frightened, Carieri said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thought about it a lot," Carieri said. "He had a lot of pretty serious 
fistfights with his dad, and would later call (me) up and say: 'I almost did 
it. I almost did it.' . . . He didn't do it because he didn't have the nerve, I 
guess. But it was just a matter of when." 
</P>
<P>
 Until December, Chris had been enrolled at a continuation school, West Granada 
High School, after he transferred there from Granada Hills High School in May, 
1993. At the regular high school, he had been unable to keep up with 
assignments because he frequently skipped classes, school officials said. In 
January he began a home study program. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't like school," said Scott Weingarten, 17, who had known Chris about 
three years. "If he went to school, he'd do good, but he didn't go much." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris liked playing video games and pool and he and his friends favored "speed 
metal," a driving, guitar-based music influenced by punk and heavy metal. He 
and many of his male friends wore haircuts closely cropped on the sides and 
long on top. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris however had frequently clashed with his father, Steven Golly, an 
electrical equipment supplier who had a reputation for being a strict 
disciplinarian. The two lived in a Northridge house on Amestoy Avenue with 
another woman and her son. Chris' mother, Pamela Golly, died several years ago 
while she and his father were going through a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 One neighbor, Alexander Frankel -- who lived near the Gollys for more than 15 
years -- said Steven Golly was an unfriendly, humorless neighbor who used to 
treat the family dog roughly during walks, grabbing the animal by the collar 
and yanking him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought he would be a difficult father," said Frankel's wife, 
Shirley. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighboring twins Jeff and Jason Feger, 13, said Chris had been a friend for 
years. They traded baseball cards, watched videos together and played baseball 
in the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris had always enjoyed showing off his father's guns, about 10 of which were 
kept in a gun case in the living room, "along with plenty of ammo," Jeff said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two years, some neighbors said, Chris began acting the part of a 
tough kid -- ditching school, neglecting studies and using drugs.  
</P>
<P>
 Neighbor Feri Niaki said Chris had scared her two weeks ago while he was 
shooting a pistol at a bird's nest in her back yard. She said she yelled at him 
to stop but became frightened and fled inside her house. 
</P>
<P>
 As he waited to be interviewed at the Devonshire police station on Tuesday 
morning, Matt Conner said he was Chris' best friend and had been at the 
family's house Monday night when Chris and his father were arguing. Conner said 
Chris was angry, talking about getting back at his father, perhaps even killing 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to talk him out of it," Conner said. "He said he wasn't going to do 
it; to shoot his father. They were having problems. They were arguing. Family 
matters. He just said he had had enough. He snapped, basically." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Chris' friends who stopped by the house Tuesday after the shooting 
described Chris as a daily drug user. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sold speed to his little buddies," in relatively small amounts, said Jamie 
Kushner, 18. "He wasn't big time. But he was definitely hooked. He's been doing 
it maybe six months." 
</P>
<P>
 Kushner said he met Chris because the two were part of a group of teen-agers 
who shared interests in drugs, alcohol and music. He said Chris loved bands 
such as Pantera, Ministry and Metallica. 
</P>
<P>
 "We partied," Kushner said. "That was our relationship. We had real good 
times, teen-age stuff. We drank our beer, smoked our weed."

 Martin Parker didn't set out to be a pioneer, but it's a role he seems to play 
with the same unpretentious aplomb he embodies on the dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker, 35, is one of Southern California's top social dancers and 
instructors, specializing in West Coast swing, the exuberant dance widely known 
by its jitterbug and Lindy Hop variations. He's also one of few African 
Americans in the area teaching swing and, one of less than a dozen anywhere in 
the country to compete in the exacting international-style waltz, fox trot and 
other ballroom dances, according to aficionados. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I didn't look at it this way. I was just dancing because I loved 
it," Parker, of Huntington Beach, said the other day. "But I've realized I am 
kind of paving the way for other blacks to go into the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 50 students a night attend Parker's classes at Danscene, the Costa Mesa 
school he has owned for five years. Most popular are his lessons in West Coast 
swing, which has endured and flourished since the Big Band era. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading a recent beginners class, he cued the basic moves he mastered over a 
decade ago, swiveling his hips subtly as he danced along with his students: 
"And ah five, six, ready go: Triple-step, triple-step, rock, tuck, turn, 
under-arm pass." 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, West Coast swing is very contemporary," he said in a subsequent 
interview. "Back in the '40s they were mostly doing a lot of footwork and not 
so many turns or patterns or arm wraps and pretzels." 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Adams, a longtime friend of Parker's who runs a leading Los Angeles swing 
studio, says Parker's versatility sets him apart. Most social dancers 
specialize in one area, such as ballroom. But Parker excels in Latin dances -- 
such as samba, rumba and cha-cha -- and the hustle, widely practiced in the 
disco era, as well as ballroom and swing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's probably the best all-around black social dancer in the country today," 
Adams said. "He's also one of the only black dance studio owners I know." 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer blacks than whites are involved in social dance and swing in Southern 
California, he said, but he believes that has to do with exposure, or the lack 
of it, more than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker's introduction to dance came while attending high school in Long 
Island, N.Y., where the hustle and Latin dances were the rage in his 
predominantly Puerto Rican neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially disinterested, "I got to see some really good dancers," he said, 
"and I got hooked." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, after his family moved to California, he got a job teaching ballroom 
dance in Long Beach, riding the wave of renewed mainstream interest triggered 
by the 1977 John Travolta hit, "Saturday Night Fever." 
</P>
<P>
 The early 1980s ushered in a resurgence in the popularity of West Coast swing, 
and Parker's first venture into major competitions. With former partner Toni 
Piazza, he made the finals three years in a row at the prestigious U.S. Open 
National Swing Dance Championships, finishing second -- by only one-tenth of a 
point -- in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair trained with Dean Collins, of Glendale, one of early Hollywood's 
hoofers who appeared in or choreographed such 1940s movies as "Buck Privates," 
starring Abbott and Costello, and "Living it Up," with Jerry Lewis and Dean 
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins "showed us some movies of what he did when he was younger, and I was 
really impressed," Parker said. "I started learning his style of swing, which 
was more of an authentic, '40s style." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker also competed in the mid-1980s in International ballroom, which 
includes the same dances as American-style ballroom, but makes more demands of 
its practitioners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very technically challenging," he said. "You're judged on how your feet 
are pointing, what your arms are doing; your hands and your head have to be in 
the right place. I managed to make it to the finals now and then." 
</P>
<P>
 During this time, Parker made his living as an independent teacher, holding 
classes at various studios and recreation centers until opening his Costa Mesa 
studio in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Business at Danscene, which draws students from Glendale to San Clemente, has 
been good, he said, boosted by his recent re-entry into the competitive arena 
(he may compete with his wife, Lisa, at this fall's U.S. Open swing 
championship in Anaheim) and his judging stints at local contests. His advanced 
classes are nearly twice the size this year as they were last year, for 
instance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm starting to get out more, to get in the public eye so people can identify 
a person with the name," he said. "When I competed regularly, I was getting 
more business than I could handle." 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting on his career ascent, Parker said when he started out, "there were 
so many good dancers," he didn't think he had a chance. He even considered 
becoming a forest ranger at one point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can remember once in high school my parents saying that I was dancing too 
much. Though they wanted me to do whatever I wanted to do, they didn't think I 
was going to be able to make a living out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, "I'm actually living my dream. I like being my own boss, and I 
love what I'm doing."

DANA PARSONS: 'HE INTENDS VICTORY' AT CHURCH FOR ANY WITH AIDS, HIV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dateline San Francisco: At the funeral Tuesday for gay newspaperman and author 
Randy Shilts, who died of AIDS, about a dozen pickets supporting a Kansas 
minister carried signs that bore such slogans as "Shilts in Hell" and "Fags 
Burn in Hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Dateline Orange County: Bruce Sonnenberg, pastor of the Village Church of 
Irvine, an evangelical congregation of about 250, is talking with me about his 
church's response to AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonnenberg forced the issue from the pulpit about five years ago. He already 
knew that two men in his congregation had the AIDS virus and he had recently 
heard the story of a Los Angeles church that told a church member with AIDS 
that he was no longer welcome. "Those are the types of things that get my 
spiritual blood boiling," Sonnenberg says, "and I decided we needed to make a 
commitment as a church that we were not going to be like that." 
</P>
<P>
 So on that Sunday morning, Sonnenberg made his case and asked the congregation 
to stand up and show support for him. "It wasn't something where I said, 'It's 
up to you and I'll do what you want,' " he says. 
</P>
<P>
 So, he asked for support . . . and he waited. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next 10 or 20 or 30 seconds, or however long it took, he says, 
everyone in the congregation, about 250 strong, rose to their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The story about Sonnenberg's congregation is one of several told in a 
just-published book by Garden Grove religious writer Dan Wooding, a former 
British tabloid journalist turned Christian soldier. The book, titled "He 
Intends Victory," derives from the name of an AIDS support group Sonnenberg set 
up that plays on the letters HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 The support group, the first by an evangelical congregation in Orange County, 
meets twice monthly and has incorporated behind its slogan. Sonnenberg says 
there is no requirement that attendees commit themselves to religious 
instruction or make any pledges to renounce their gay lifestyle, if that's how 
they got the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Bear in mind that Sonnenberg's flock is no group of liberal dissidents. As 
evangelicals, they generally adhere strongly to the Bible's teachings and 
subscribe to its missionary calling. Even more to the point, they aren't 
willing to budge from the belief that homosexuality is a sin. They see it as 
one sin in a world of sin, and not one any more or less worthy of condemnation 
than their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonnenberg conceded that the steadfast belief of the sinfulness of 
homosexuality will automatically maintain a barrier between the church and many 
gays. "I've been emphatic to say that as Christians we have no right to mock or 
make fun of homosexuals in any way," he says. "I don't think there's a 
homophobic attitude in the church. I believe there is a sense of compassion for 
people who are homosexual, and I understand that in the homosexual community 
they say what right have I got to do that (to label homosexuality as sinful). I 
say that I have every right to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Sonnenberg was involved early on with Wooding's book. "The real purpose of the 
book," Sonnenberg says, "is to provide an opportunity for people, specifically 
Christians, to see the challenges before us with those people who are 
HIV-positive or who have AIDS and those affected by the disease." 
</P>
<P>
 Why do you use the word challenge, I ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because there are stigmas and pain involved. Therefore, there are a lot of 
issues that aren't real clear in the culture and society and certainly in the 
church, in how to live and deal with and relate to people who are HIV-positive 
or have AIDS. So, the challenge is to learn how to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 I know the Bible verses Sonnenberg refers to. I also know that other clergy 
have said they don't necessarily interpret them as blanket condemnations of 
homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 As someone who doesn't consider homosexuality a sin requiring divine 
forgiveness, I can't be completely in the Sonnenberg camp. But at a time when 
some preachers take to the streets to condemn gays and proclaim AIDS as God's 
retribution against gays, Sonnenberg deserves acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
 The simple truth is, he could have remained silent on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 So how risky was it to confront his congregation? 
</P>
<P>
 "In one sense, it wasn't risky at all. I knew their hearts, I knew they would 
stand up and make a commitment. They had already been helping the homeless for 
years, it's a sensitive congregation and so I was real confident they would 
make the commitment with me. But I also knew there would be a few who would be 
really wrestling with it, and I wanted to be sensitive to them, but I thought 
it was time we made the commitment together." 
</P>
<P>
 The story of Sonnenberg and his Village Church seems appropriate in the week 
of Randy Shilts' funeral. Perhaps Shilts would have eagerly debated Sonnenberg 
over what constitutes sin, but I'm reasonably sure he also would have been 
happy to shake his hand.

GAY-SUPPORT GROUP FORMED AT 2ND SCHOOL; EDUCATION: HUNTINGTON BEACH HIGH CLUB 
MEETS NO ORGANIZED OPPOSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Following the lead of students at a nearby high school, a group of about 20 
Huntington Beach High School teen-agers have formed their own support group for 
gay and lesbian students. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Huntington Beach Student Alliance said they decided to start a 
campus group after watching the struggles of a handful of Fountain Valley High 
School students who recently found themselves in the midst of a politically 
charged debate over their support group. 
</P>
<P>
 "This alliance gives gay students the opportunity to meet with people who are 
going through many of the same problems," said Erich Phinizy, 17, one of the 
Huntington Beach High students who founded the new group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since high school is so much about being accepted, we wanted to start a club 
where that would be possible." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman with the Gay and Lesbian Alliance of Orange County said the 
Fountain Valley and Huntington Beach student alliances are the only such high 
school support groups she knows of in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of heated exchange, the Huntington Beach Union High School 
District Board of Trustees voted in January to retain a district policy that 
allows student groups not related to the curriculum -- such as the gay and 
lesbian alliances and Bible study groups -- to hold meetings on campus. Both 
Huntington Beach High and Fountain Valley High are in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that board meeting, we just said to ourselves that if they could do it, 
we could," Phinizy said. "They paved the way for us. So far we haven't had to 
go through the kind of protests they had to put up with."  
</P>
<P>
 Phinizy said the Huntington Beach group includes students who are not gay or 
lesbian. 
</P>
<P>
 The support group has met twice so far and members are organizing activities 
with the Fountain Valley Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The aim of the group is to promote an open-minded environment for gay and 
lesbian students," said Phinizy, who was a guest Tuesday on the "Subversity" 
program on the student-run radio station at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Erich's mother, Margret Phinizy, said she is proud of her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always had a lot of school spirit," she said. "I've always supported gay 
and lesbian issues, so it's no surprise to me." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Huntington Beach Student Alliance has not faced the campus and 
community protest that came in October when the Fountain Valley Student 
Alliance gained club status. 
</P>
<P>
 At one school board meeting in December, more than 200 students, parents and 
protesters crammed into a district auditorium to debate the Fountain Valley 
group's future. Some club members said they were pelted with apples during 
lunch breaks. English teacher and alliance supervisor Michael Poff 
characterized the atmosphere on campus as "hostile." 
</P>
<P>
 Several groups -- including the Anaheim-based Traditional Values Coalition 
headed by the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, the student-run Future Good Boys Group and 
various parent groups -- have opposed such organizations, saying that 
homosexual lifestyles should not be advocated or promoted under the guise of 
tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, none of those groups have protested the Huntington Beach Student 
Alliance, Phinizy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've received a lot of support from the Fountain Valley Student Alliance; 
they told us basically what they went through and we learned from their 
mistakes. We just want to keep the alliance in tune with its purpose and skip 
all the protest and controversy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Huntington Beach High senior Craig Reade, who has been involved in the 
alliance from the beginning, described campus sentiment toward gays as very 
negative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, most really don't approve. I've been harassed a lot, people scream 
anti-gay remarks at me across campus," said Reade, 18, who is editor-in-chief 
of the school's newspaper. He said he is not gay. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really no different than stereotyping blacks and women. Gays have a 
constitutional right just like anyone else, they're people too," Reade said.  
</P>
<P>
 One alliance member, a 17-year-old senior who is a lesbian, said she was eager 
to join the group.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's been really hard the last couple of years dealing with this, trying to 
tell my parents and deal with it myself," she said. "This group gives me the 
opportunity to discuss those problems with people who may be in the same 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach High Principal Jim Staunton said there have been no reported 
anti-gay incidents on campus since the alliance was created earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 All but four of Orange County's 27 school districts have adopted equal-access 
policies allowing student groups to meet on campus before or after school or at 
lunchtime.

PROBE ASKED INTO BUILDER'S FIND OF BONES; DEVELOPMENT: CITY URGES INVESTIGATION 
OF KOLL'S HANDLING OF REMAINS AT BOLSA CHICA AFTER PROTESTS BY NATIVE 
AMERICANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Following angry speeches by Native Americans, the City Council Tuesday night 
voted to ask for a grand jury investigation into the Koll Real Estate Group's 
handling of 8,000-year-old human bone fragments found near the Bolsa Chica 
wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're dealing with the lives of fellow human beings," said Councilman Ralph 
Bauer, who made the motion for the investigation. "All of us would like our 
ancestors to be treated with dignity." His motion was approved on a 5-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of Native Americans, as well as members of the council, have been 
angry over the issue since Jan. 25, when news reports revealed that an 
archeologist working for the Koll company had unearthed the bone fragments in 
1992 directly in the path of the company's proposed construction of 4,286 homes 
on or near the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 They were irate that the find had not been mentioned in a draft environmental 
impact report on the project released by the county late last year. And a map 
later leaked from the coroner's office revealed that more than 20 subsequent 
bone clusters had been found, raising concerns that the 7.4-acre archeological 
site may have once been a prehistoric burial ground. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is whether the Koll company, which owns most of the property, 
properly handled and reported the discovery of the bones, or whether it covered 
up the find to safeguard building plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy Dunn, senior vice president of the Koll Group, said the company had done 
nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've abided by the law and followed all procedures," she said. In a letter 
distributed to council members on Tuesday, Dunn described the call for a grand 
jury investigation as unwarranted.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are amazed and appalled that this matter is still on the agenda for 
consideration by the City Council," she wrote. "There is no basis for a 
criminal investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the coroner's office has said he is satisfied that the find 
was reported in a timely manner. Tom Mathews, director of planning for the 
county's Environmental Management Agency, which oversaw preparation of the EIR, 
has said that the find was not mentioned in the document because its historical 
significance has not yet been scientifically validated. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the issue drew about 600 residents to a city hearing on 
the EIR, at which the archeological finds were hotly discussed. A short time 
later, about 60 people, mostly Native Americans, protested on the steps of City 
Hall, saying that they had not been kept informed about their ancestors' 
remains. And last week, Nancy Desautels -- the archeologist who made the 
discovery -- received a three-inch bullet in the mail bearing her name and the 
slogan "Remember Our Ancestors." 
</P>
<P>
 The archeologist, who said she considered the mailing a serious death threat, 
turned it over to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that if any investigation is warranted it is the FBI's 
investigation into the threats made against Dr. Desautels," Dunn said in her 
letter, which blamed the threat on the "emotionally charged atmosphere of 
suspicion, false allegations and anger" created by the city's actions. 
</P>
<P>
 The emotional atmosphere continued Tuesday night as more than 10 Native 
Americans spoke in support of Bauer's motion. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an outrage," said Gerald Millard, a Sioux from Los Angeles.

SANTA ANA OKS UTILITY TAX HIKE TO PAY FOR JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Declaring an assault on crime, the Santa Ana City Council unanimously approved 
construction of a $105-million jail and police headquarters Tuesday and a 1% 
utility tax hike to help pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous vote came after dozens of residents told of increasing assaults 
and burglaries in their neighborhoods and said the tax hike was a small price 
to pay for safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "Raising taxes is at times dishonest, immoral and dirty," resident Jose Vargas 
said. "But for the security of my family, the pride of my city and the chance 
to have a first-class police station . . . this time, but only this time, 
please take my money." 
</P>
<P>
 But dozens of residents said the utility users tax hike, pegged as the main 
means of financing the jail and police administration building, would be a 
hardship for Santa Ana's low-income population and should be put to voters.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe that now is the appropriate time to impose another tax 
increase, particularly without it going before the voters," community activist 
John Raya said. "Yes, it is only $18 more on your utility bill, but the 
gasoline tax was just $40 or $50 a year for an average driver . . . so what's 
the big deal? Pretty soon it adds up to a lot in taxes that people have 
absolutely no voice in. That's what's fundamentally wrong in all this." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials countered that the increase from the existing 5% utility tax on 
gas, electricity, telephone and water bills to 6% is small -- $1.50 a month or 
$18 a year for an average family. Needy families would qualify for exemptions, 
as they do now. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Lisa Mills said there were few alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't a magic source of money in this town. I have to support (the tax 
increase) because I don't see any other source of financing," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Putting the matter to voters would leave the City Council in a precarious 
position the next time they needed to increase revenue, said Rod Coloma, 
executive director of finance and management services. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you say you have to go to a vote of the people every time you want to 
change the utility user tax, you're setting up a dangerous precedent," he said. 
"It's one of the revenue-raising abilities that the City Council has, just like 
if they wanted to raise fees on dog licenses." 
</P>
<P>
 The tax hike would generate an additional $3.2 million annually for the city's 
general fund, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 That boost is key to financing the proposed jail and police administration 
building, which officials said are sorely needed to keep Santa Ana's 
misdemeanor offenders from passing through the county jail's revolving door and 
back onto the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The administration building, they add, has been in need of expansion since the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our facility that we have here is full to the max. We actually occupy two 
floors of City Hall because we don't have enough space for our personnel," Lt. 
Robert Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Helton said the new jail could hold sentenced prisoners for up to a year and 
would greatly enhance community policing efforts. A 48-cell temporary facility 
that opened last year only holds prisoners until they are arraigned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to have a way of ensuring that people who commit crime in this 
community are removed from the street and kept in custody, even if it means at 
the local level, for more than a couple of hours," Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The utility users tax increase "is the only possible vehicle for funding a 
project of this size," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Located on an eight-acre parcel near the Santa Ana Municipal Stadium at Civic 
Center Drive and Shelton Street, the project includes a 236,000-square-foot 
administration building designed to accommodate expansion through the year 
2050; a four-story jail for 420 inmates with a kitchen and laundry; a garage; 
and a 900-foot tunnel linking the jail with the Orange County Intake/Release 
Center.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; DEATH OF INFANT RULED AN ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The death of a 2-month-old girl whose sleeping father rolled over her in bed 
has been officially ruled an accident, the coroner's office said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy conducted Tuesday revealed that Patricia Lorena Uribe died of 
suffocation caused by "paternal overlay."Paternal or maternal overlay is the 
term for injuries occurring when a parent rolls onto a child, a coroner's 
investigator said. 
</P>
<P>
 The infant was reported injured about 12:25 a.m. Sunday when her mother, Peggy 
Uribe, 35, arrived home from work and discovered the child not breathing and 
pinned beneath her 36-year-old husband, Jaime Uribe. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple frantically called 911 and a dispatcher instructed them on how to 
perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The child was first taken to Hoag 
Hospital in Newport Beach, then moved to Children's Hospital of Orange County 
in Orange, where she was pronounced dead Monday evening.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; LOSING CANDIDATES, PACS SETTLE LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two unsuccessful school board candidates have agreed to a $12,000 settlement 
in a suit in which they alleged that two political action committees operated 
by a local teachers union violated state political reporting laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon E. McKinney and James M. Ball last June alleged that the teacher-union 
groups failed to observe reporting deadlines in spending more than $25,000 to 
mail campaign literature supporting two successful candidates in the 1992 
Huntington Beach Union High School District board of trustees election. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinney said the reporting delays, in effect, concealed from voters that 
opponents Michael Simons and Bonnie Bruce were supported by teachers' groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball, who narrowly lost to Simons, said the disclosure came too late to use as 
a campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I would have been able to bring this out at a candidate's night and if the 
press had covered it, it conceivably would have put me ahead of" Simons, Ball 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simons received 31,849 votes to Ball's 29,168. McKinney received 21,425. Bruce 
was an easy winner with about 70,000 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the settlement approved in court call for $2,500 to go to McKinney 
and Ball, $2,500 to the state's general fund and $7,000 for attorney fees and 
filing costs.  
</P>
<P>
 Dan Shepard, chairman of the District Education Assn.'s quality education 
committee, said Tuesday that the reporting errors were minor and technical and 
happened because a new committee treasurer was unfamiliar with "an abbreviated 
set of guidelines from the registrar." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee reported the expenditures as soon as it was notified to do so by 
the registrar of voters, Shepard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shepard said the legal action was "a nuisance suit" and that the teachers 
group agreed to settlement terms in order to head off mounting legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinney and Ball said the District Education Assn. was required by the state 
Political Reform Act to report the expenditures within 24 hours of spending the 
money. However, the association didn't file the report until several days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinney said they each spent about $450 in their campaigns. ROBERT BARKER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; STATION IS MORE THAN A TRAIN DEPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last time Denny Garcia strolled into the local train station, he had a 
concealed pistol strapped to his leg. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time -- five or six years ago -- Garcia, 65, was the night watchman at 
the landmark station, and he sometimes had to haul drunken riders off buses, 
chase away car burglars prowling in the parking lot, and console people who had 
missed their ride home. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia was back at the station recently -- wearing a blue baseball cap and a 
matching jacket -- where he quietly waited for four hours for friends coming in 
from the Bay Area. Garcia was one of three or four people sitting on the 
lobby's wooden benches, in contrast to other days when the station is bustling. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good place to kill some time," said the local resident and Korean 
War veteran. "I don't mind coming down here to watch the people. But there is 
nobody around here anymore that I know." 
</P>
<P>
 The stylistic train station, probably best known for its appearance in the 
movie "Rain Man," opened in 1985 and is owned by the city. Its 
Mediterranean-style architecture, tiled courtyard, two-faced clocks and curved 
stairway provide a tasteful setting for anyone stuck there with nothing to do 
but wait. 
</P>
<P>
 The station's proper name is the Santa Ana Regional Transportation Center. But 
there is more going on there than just people meeting trains and buses. In 
fact, amid the daily bustle and commuter downtime, many go there with no plans 
of going anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 At the far end of the lobby -- past all the benches, near the Greyhound bus 
stop -- is a court referral office. People go there to register for community 
service at local nonprofit agencies to avoid paying fines for drunk driving and 
other misdemeanors. On this quiet day, those folks outnumbered the few people 
waiting for trains and buses. 
</P>
<P>
 Debra Walters, who works for the Volunteer Center of Greater Orange County, 
which operates the referral service, acknowledged that a train station is a 
strange place for such an office. But it works. 
</P>
<P>
 On occasion, Walters said, stranded travelers wander into her office 
overlooking the parking lot and scan through job listings in the center's 
library or volunteer to work at a local soup kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get a lot of interest that way," she said. "People come in here just to 
ask, 'What is the volunteer center?' " 
</P>
<P>
 While his wife did some business at the center, Don Anderson, 73, stood out in 
the sun on a balcony overlooking the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never been to this new train station," said Anderson, who moved to the 
city in 1921 and remembers the smaller depot near 4th Street, not far from the 
current station. "I thought this would be a good time to come and check it 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 And if the volunteer center does not meet every need, there is a banquet 
facility known as Casa Santa Fe that hosts wedding receptions and various 
conferences, and as well as a place for customers to pay Comcast cable 
television bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I come in in the morning or leave at 8 o'clock at night and this 
place is packed," Walters said. "And other times it is like this," peaceful and 
quiet.BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; WATER DISTRICT GIVES DONATION TO SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Irvine Ranch Water District is donating more than $15,000 in cash and 
computer equipment to the city's schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The donation includes a $8,475 grant that will go to buy science equipment for 
high schools in the Irvine Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant was the byproduct of a joint effort by local schools and the water 
district to encourage residents to use "low-flow" toilets that conserve water. 
Teachers and students helped the water district promote and administer a toilet 
trade-in program, in which residents exchanged their old toilets for low-flow 
models, said Joyce Wegner-Gwidt, spokeswoman for the water district. 
</P>
<P>
 The water district also plans to donate $7,125 in computer equipment, 
including keyboards and monitors. The equipment is likely to be used by the 
school district for a networking system. 
</P>
<P>
 Wegner-Gwidt said the water district is buying advanced computers and did not 
need the old ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are outdated on the market and have little real resale value," she 
said.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; RECALL SIGNATURES TURNED IN, AWAIT OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Charles V. Smith and three other City Council members are likely to face 
a recall election in June as recall proponents turned in Monday what appeared 
to be more than sufficient signatures to qualify for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Mary Lou Morey said that a preliminary count indicated that the 
signatures exceeded the 6,938 required for each petition. However, the 
signatures have yet to be verified by the Orange County Registrar of Voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Morey said that the county registrar has 30 days to check the signatures' 
validity. She said she expects the process to be completed sooner to allow the 
city time to prepare for the expected June election. 
</P>
<P>
 The balloting would coincide with the state primaries and would cost about 
$30,000, Morey said. If the election were not paired with the primary it would 
cost the city $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The petition to recall Smith generated 9,051 signatures, Morey said. There 
were 8,892 signatures for Councilman Craig Schweisinger; 8,918 for Councilwoman 
Charmayne S. Bohman and 8,836 for Councilman Tony Lam. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that the people are saying, 'Enough,' "said Mike Garrison, a director 
of the firefighters union, which is supporting the recall. "Now, we'll wait 
(and see) if they will let that stick when the election comes up." 
</P>
<P>
 The petition drive started in October following months of dispute between the 
firefighters union and city officials over cuts in the Fire Department budget 
and a subsequent reorganization that included layoffs and putting a fire truck 
out of service. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the reorganization was necessary to expand the city's 
paramedic services and reduce the Fire Department's overtime expenses. 
Firefighters union officials argued that the cuts put public safety in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the firefighters union and their supporters resorted to "scare 
tactics and untruths" to get voters to sign the petitions. Now, he said, he and 
his colleagues have to work harder to "tell the truth to the people." 
</P>
<P>
 "They (firefighters) told seniors that we are doing away with paramedics, when 
in fact we're increasing paramedic services," Smith said. "They said we were 
closing fire stations, and they lied about equipment changes." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the recall is costly and unnecessary because his current term and 
those of Schweisinger and Lam end in November. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; 3 VIE FOR NATIONAL FUTURE CITY AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ancona wasn't built in a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the city took more than two months to erect and perfect. That's 
still not shabby for a town with no crime, no traffic nightmares and a growing 
populace, a town where trains run efficiently and residents have access to good 
emergency services. 
</P>
<P>
 The ideal burg for the year 2195 was built by a trio of Orange County urban 
planners -- three kids barely into their teens. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Carroll, Cory Jobst and Jacob Smith created the fictional town using a 
computer game called "Sim City." Today, the three students from Bernardo Yorba 
Junior High School in Yorba Linda find themselves in Washington for a 
competition against six other teams from across the country to decide who has 
built the best city of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest, sponsored by Rockwell International and several engineering 
societies, is part of National Engineers Week. Call it a deceivingly addictive 
way to get teen-agers excited about science and math. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff said that he, Cory and Jacob created and obliterated Ancona twice on the 
computer before settling on their third version of the town. "I think we've got 
it now, though," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sim City" players pick sites for roads, police stations, airports and other 
landmarks in their cities. But to cover expenses such as road repairs and 
firefighters' salaries, "Sim City" players have to tax their computerized 
residents. That can become sticky, Jeff said, just as in real life. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know now that controlling a city is a whole lot harder than saying, 'The 
government should do this,' because they might not have the money," said 
13-year-old Jeff. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from possible destruction by their creators, simulated cities face the 
threat of disaster by earthquakes, fires and Godzilla. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff headed the team's effort to build an 18-square-foot scale model of the 
town for the competition, complete with gray wood blocks for office buildings 
and brown wood chunks for apartment buildings. Cory, 13, the computer whiz of 
the bunch, put together the technical side. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacob, 14, wrote the team's essay and will likely field many of the judges' 
queries about Ancona when the youths step before a panel today at the Academy 
of Engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 The questions figure to be tough, the teen-agers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last time, they asked us if we thought about child care or sewage," said 
Jeff, referring to panelists who judged January's regional competition in Buena 
Park. "We didn't know what to say, because you can't control those things in 
'Sim City.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But now, if they ask, at least we'll have an answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Ferguson, a science teacher at Bernardo Yorba, selected the team in 
October from nine groups of students vying to represent the school. The team 
won a West Coast competition in January, making them eligible to compete in 
Washington. Ferguson has accompanied the team to their competitions, along with 
Rockwell engineer and team mentor Ray Fairbanks. 
</P>
<P>
 The three eighth-grade teammates have known each other for more than four 
years, they said, and all share a common interest in music, books and 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading is Jacob's passion. He just finished Upton Sinclair's stomach-turning 
industrial classic "The Jungle" and said he races through Tom Clancy novels, 
too. "I read all sorts of stuff -- it's a lot more fun than just watching TV," 
said Jacob, who is interested in studying environmental engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 Cory said he likes drawing and math and might go into architecture. Jeff added 
that he enjoys building and putting things together and may pursue a career in 
computer science.  
</P>
<P>
 All three friends play wind instruments in several school bands -- Jeff at 
trombone, Cory at saxophone and Jacob at both saxophone and bassoon. 
</P>
<P>
 If they win today's competition, the teammates get a free stint at the U.S. 
Space Camp in Huntsville, Ala. That sounds great to Jeff's mom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful thing for kids," said Myrna Carroll, beaming. "You get to 
play astronaut." 
</P>
<P>
 And not to forget the other perk of a victory: a planned visit to the Oval 
Office to meet President Clinton. All three teammates had no idea what they 
would say to the President, although Jacob quipped, "I'd ask him, ' Sooo , 
how's that trade deal with Japan?' " 
</P>
<P>
 When they come home, don't expect them to be "Sim City"-ed-out, either.  
</P>
<P>
 "We just got 'Sim City 2000,' " said Jacob, referring to the new, souped-up 
version of the game in which players can build rooms underground and lay canals 
through their cyber metropolis. "We'll keep playing." ALICIA DI RADO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; FORUM LETS SERVICE GROUPS SWAP ADVICE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Looking down the barrel of a large budget deficit about two years ago, city 
officials wanted to trim costs, and the Human Affairs Committee was high on the 
list of cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of eliminating the program, which deals with a broad range of 
social needs in San Clemente, city officials decided to reorganize it. Today, 
they say, they couldn't be happier with the results, which far outweigh the 
cost in city staff support. 
</P>
<P>
 What changed was the addition of the Human Affairs Forum, a monthly gathering 
spot for service groups with a cause. The next meeting will be at 3 p.m. March 
9, at the Ole Hanson Beach Club, 105 W. Avenida Pico. 
</P>
<P>
 When a homeless shelter needs blankets, advocates come here for suggestions on 
raising money and goods. If a group of gang prevention volunteers needs advice 
about filling out forms for government grants, the combined knowledge of more 
than 140 service organizations and individuals is available. 
</P>
<P>
 Run by the Human Affairs Committee, the forum is not so much about serving the 
needy as how to serve the needy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about swapping ideas," said Chris Christofferson, an elder with the 
First Presbyterian Church in San Clemente. "The first conversation we need to 
get something started happens here." 
</P>
<P>
 There are no restrictions for membership: Any person or group serving the 
public can stop by. Tables are set up in a circle and anywhere between 20 and 
100 people usually show up to introduce themselves and their causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Glendinning came to the group as a concerned citizen who wanted to see 
bilingual flyers printed and distributed to the Latino community to let them 
know about the availability of public pools. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendinning went to several local groups, where "I met with resistance," she 
said. "I went to the forum, I found all kinds of reinforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Glendinning is a Human Affairs Committee member. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum was also a magnet for Christofferson, who first came to the meetings 
as a representative of his church. Now he's involved with several service 
groups, including the Youth Task Force, the Food For All anti-hunger program 
and a movement to build a shelter for battered women. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started with my personal interest and the interest of my church and began 
to plug into all these other causes" at the forum, Christofferson said. "I've 
always felt people shouldn't be hungry, and I have a real feeling about gangs 
spreading into society and this is a place to do something about it."  
</P>
<P>
 Regional organizations also stop by to plug their programs. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force spokesperson talked about a 
program that recruits churches to provide temporary shelter for the homeless. 
Updates were passed out on the status of fund raising for the proposed home for 
battered women, known as Laura's House. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people have a lot of energy, the committee is working out very well," 
City Manager Michael W. Parness said. "People tend to look to city government 
to supply the answers to their problems. If we didn't have (the committee and 
the forum), the weight on the city to finance social needs would grow heavier 
and heavier." 
</P>
<P>
 With money for charitable causes growing harder to find, the Human Affairs 
Forum might be "a model for how charitable organizations might have to operate 
in the future," Parness said. "I think this is a way for these agencies to 
survive as resources diminish."FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; COMPREHENSIVE PLAN CENTERS ON CRIME

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Free after-school recreation programs, fitness and nutrition classes for 
students, job-training programs for youngsters and continued anti-gang patrols 
are among the crime-fighting measures proposed in a new comprehensive plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has taken the first steps toward implementing preventive and 
enforcement proposals to reduce gang violence, crime and the deterioration of 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The 65-page plan, created over the past four months by a special committee 
including representatives of the council, Planning Commission, Parks and 
Recreation Commission and San Clemente High School, was presented to the 
council last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike some cities, we have not lost the battle to preserve the quality of 
life we have come to expect in San Clemente," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 To be successful, the report said, "first, the city must use all of its 
available resources to focus upon the challenges confronting our community. 
Second, San Clemente residents and businesses must make an ongoing commitment 
to become involved and make a difference in our community." 
</P>
<P>
 The report caps months of community debate sparked by the death of 17-year-old 
Steve Woods after an alleged gang-related attack at Calafia County Beach Park. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past six months alone, there have been 10 major gang-related incidents 
in the city, according to the report. An additional four incidents occurred 
outside the city but involved suspected San Clemente gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 The report includes 21 recommendations costing between $100,000 and $175,000, 
depending on how many are approved. 
</P>
<P>
 New program proposals that involve extra spending, including expansion of the 
Orange County Conservation Corps into San Clemente, Dana Point and San Juan 
Capistrano, will be brought back to the council for further consideration 
during upcoming budget hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the council unanimously endorsed recommendations that do not require 
extra spending, including the continuation of beefed-up local and regional gang 
patrols through the Sheriff's Department and volunteer programs promoting code 
enforcement, mentorships and job training. ANNA CEKOLA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; BILL WOULD LET CITIES BAN STREET VENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER and MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County legislator has introduced a bill that would allow cities to 
ban street vending and would negate an appeals court decision that voided an 
Anaheim ban. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, introduced this month by State Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove), 
would change the state vehicle code to say cities "may prohibit vending from a 
vehicle upon a street." 
</P>
<P>
 The 4th District Court of Appeal last year nullified a 1992 Anaheim ordinance 
that prohibited street vending in residential neighborhoods. The court said the 
vehicle code allows cities to regulate street vending but not to ban it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The senator sees this as an issue of local control," Joe Yocca, Hurtt's chief 
legislative aide, said Tuesday. "Local governments should have the right to ban 
or not ban the sales activity on their streets as they see fit." 
</P>
<P>
 Yocca said the senator is confident the bill will be passed this year, perhaps 
by summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Javier Barajas, an Anaheim vendor and president of the Southern California 
Street Vendors Assn., said Tuesday that he was unaware of Hurtt's bill. But he 
called it an example of racism against Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is news to me. I didn't know about it. If they don't let us work with 
dignity, with licenses and legally, than what do they want us to do?" Barajas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's approximately 150 licensed vendors, who are almost exclusively 
Latino, sell a wide variety of products, including produce, groceries, 
cigarettes, clothing and furniture, from the back of parked trucks and vans. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a land of immigrants where opportunity is for everyone, not just 
Anglos," he said. "I'm not afraid to defend my children and my brothers. We are 
good people and I will keep fighting (against such bans) until I die." 
</P>
<P>
 The vendors' opponents -- who are mostly white with some Latinos and Asians -- 
deny that race has anything to do with their stand. They accuse the vendors of 
parking for hours in front of homes and stores. They say the vendors bring 
litter, noise and traffic congestion to their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim City Atty. Jack L. White said the ordinance banning residential street 
vending has been stricken from the city's code books and could not be 
implemented unless it is readopted by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The council recently superseded the ordinance by adopting one that allows 
vending but requires that trucks be moved at least 100 feet every 10 minutes, 
White said.TERRY SPENCER and MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; NO SUSPECTS FOUND IN GUARDS' SHOOTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The investigations into the unrelated shooting deaths of two unarmed security 
guards, killed within hours of each other over the holiday weekend, continued 
Tuesday, but police said there are still no suspects in either case. 
</P>
<P>
 One shooting occurred in the lobby of a movie theater in Orange on Sunday 
night, the other in the parking lot of a bar in Garden Grove early Monday 
morning. No motive has been established in either case, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a whodunit right now," said Orange Police Lt. Timm Browne, whose 
department is investigating the slaying of 23-year-old Dagoberto Carrero, a 
former Marine and veteran of the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrero was standing at his post inside the Century City Centre Theatre near 
The City Shopping Center when he was hit in a barrage of gunfire at about 11 
p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an incredibly cruel crime," Browne said. "Especially in light of the 
fact that everyone we talked to described this young man as hard-working, 
motivated and polite. To have someone take his life like this certainly makes 
you wonder about it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrero's employer, Patrol One, is offering a $10,000 reward for information 
leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are looking for a group of teen-agers who reportedly threatened Carrero 
when he asked them to leave the theater so a cleaning crew could straighten up 
after a showing of the film "Addams Family Values" at 7:15 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Browne asks that anyone who was at the theater at that time contact Detective 
Mike Harper at (714) 744-7513 or Detective Pat Thayer at (714) 744-7515. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Garden Grove police are asking for the public's help in capturing 
whoever shot 19-year-old Rupert Morales, who was killed less than two hours 
later as he attempted to direct a car into a parking space at Nick's 
Hide-A-Way, 8284 Garden Grove Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still working all angles of the case," said Garden Grove Police 
Investigator Jeff McGlaughlin. 
</P>
<P>
 McGlaughlin said witnesses described the assailant's vehicle, from which the 
fatal shots were fired, as a Chevrolet Monte Carlo. But the color of the 
vehicle is not known because varying descriptions have been given. 
</P>
<P>
 The bar, in the 8000 block of Garden Grove Boulevard, has a clientele of 
mostly male members of the gay community. McGlaughlin said the bar had not been 
a target of violence in the past, and it appears the victim was "in the wrong 
place at the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
 McGlaughlin asks that anyone with possible information about the shooting of 
Morales contact the Garden Grove Police Department at (714) 741-5704. GREG

STUDY SEES PROBLEMS FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS OF ELDERLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AILEEN CHO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 America's elderly enjoyed a "golden age" of economic comfort and longevity in 
the 1980s, increasing in numbers by 22% to 31 million, according to a study 
released Tuesday by UCI sociologists. 
</P>
<P>
 But consequent decades may or may not be so golden as the aging of America 
affects funding for health and economic resources and as the elderly population 
diversifies, the sociologists said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sociology professors Judith Treas and Ramon Torrecilha found that more than 
half of America's "elderly" -- which they defined as 65 and older -- were 
comfortably middle-class. 
</P>
<P>
 "The overall picture is that the '80s were very good to the elderly 
population," Treas said in an interview from San Francisco, where she presented 
a paper on their findings. At the same time, "there are still people for whom 
the golden age is not golden." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those are elderly women who are at a special risk for poverty and single 
status, and aged immigrants who are financially less well off and may have 
problems stemming from lack of assimilation. Both groups are growing in size, 
the study found. 
</P>
<P>
 "The position of elderly in society is fairly stable, but I think we're going 
to see distinct groups of elderly fairing worse than others -- overall more 
disparity," said Torrecilha of coming decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, based on the U.S. Census, was presented Tuesday to the American 
Assn. for the Advancement of Science. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the 100-page report -- called "The Older Population: Demographic, 
Social and Economic Trends" -- the baby boomers aged in a time of expanding 
Social Security, Medicare and pension benefits, which contributed to the 
flourishing of the 65-plus generation in the 1980s, Treas said. But as policies 
change and the elderly population includes more immigrants and single people, 
the aging will be more vulnerable to financial and health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to think carefully about how they will be affected under the new 
health care plan," co-author Torrecilha said. "You still see that one-quarter 
of the elderly that are poor or near poor . . . cannot live as independently" 
as their peers. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found that the numbers of Americans who are 65 and older grew twice 
as fast as the rest of the population in the '80s. Among the most noticeable 
trends were the growth in the numbers of aging minorities. By 2050, the number 
of aging who are white will have decreased from 87% to 65%. At the same time, 
aging Latinos and Asian Americans, who make up 3% and 1% of the elderly 
respectively, will have increased to 15% and 8%. Elderly blacks will go from 8% 
to 11%. 
</P>
<P>
 The study emphasized the diversity within the label "elderly" as well. Though 
using the traditional retirement-at-65 mark to define the boundary, it conceded 
that "few Americans keep working to age 65 anymore. . . . " Users of the 
traditional label will "have a hard time reconciling the continuing vigor and 
independence of most 65-year-olds. . . . "

MAN WRONGLY CONVICTED SEEKS TO START TRIAL OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN WEIKEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lawyers for a former Tustin Marine improperly convicted of murder sought to 
roll back the prosecution's case even further Tuesday by asking a state appeals 
court to return the double-homicide case to Municipal Court for a new 
preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The request was made on behalf of Thomas R. Merrill, a lance corporal who was 
found guilty in 1991 of killing two people and wounding a third during the 
robbery of the Newport Coin Exchange. Last year, he was granted a new trial 
because the prosecution withheld from the defense critical evidence that 
pointed to Merrill's innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 During Tuesday's session before the 4th District Court of Appeal, two justices 
took jabs at the Orange County district attorney's office, including a remark 
about the original prosecutor in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the deputy district attorney assigned to appeals candidly revealed in 
court that he had recommended to his superiors that defense attorneys be given 
the new preliminary hearing they are seeking, but his recommendation was 
rejected.  
</P>
<P>
 "It may be in the district attorney's interest to have another prelim(inary 
hearing) to see if it still has a case," Justice Edward J. Wallin said as the 
hearing neared its end. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a case, your honor," answered Deputy Dist. Atty. Eric W. Snethen. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary hearings are used in felony cases to determine whether there is 
sufficient evidence to try a defendant in Superior Court. They are usually 
limited proceedings to explore the most basic evidence, but the accused has the 
right to put on a defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys William J. Genego and John D. Barnett are appealing Orange County 
Superior Court Commissioner Richard M. Aronson's ruling that denied Merrill a 
new preliminary hearing late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Aronson erred, they say, because Merrill, who is still in jail, was denied the 
right to defend himself at his first hearing when prosecutors withheld the 
statements of a key eyewitness from his attorney. Aronson concluded that it 
would not have changed the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records and testimony, the witness told the prosecution at 
least twice that Merrill was not one of the men he saw fleeing the Newport Coin 
Exchange immediately after the robbery. The law requires that statements 
pointing to innocence be turned over to the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to imagine that he could have been denied a more substantial 
right," Genego told the court. "The issue is whether Merrill should have even 
been charged in this case. This was tremendously exonerating evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Genego described the prosecution's misconduct as "egregious" and asked the 
court to grant a new preliminary hearing to discourage the district attorney's 
office from withholding evidence in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 If Genego and Barnett succeed, the charges against Merrill will be dismissed 
in Superior Court, forcing the district attorney to decide whether to refile 
the case in Municipal Court. In effect, it would force the prosecution to start 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenging the defense's argument, Snethen said Merrill "wants the cake he 
already ate." He pointed out that his attorneys used the same arguments to get 
him a new trial; now they want to use them again to delay the trial by forcing 
a new preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 If a new preliminary hearing were ordered, Snethen claimed, it would turn out 
the same as the first, with Merrill being bound over for trial in Superior 
Court. Another witness, he noted, has said that Merrill looked like one of the 
men leaving the coin shop. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Wallin asked Snethen about Genego's idea of punishing 
prosecutors for misconduct. Snethen said the cost has already been high for the 
district attorney and the public because a new trial was ordered. It has been 
set for early April. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an issue of fairness, not cost," Wallin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the end of Snethen's argument, Justice David G. Sills remarked about 
former Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeoffrey L. Robinson, whose conduct has been called 
into question in several other high-profile trials before the appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this the last case with this particular prosecutor that we have to contend 
with, or will there be others?" Sills said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Merrill case, court testimony and a sworn affidavit indicate that 
Robinson was aware of the statement of an eyewitness who said Merrill was not 
one of the men at the coin exchange, but did not tell the defense about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, who is now in private practice in Mission Viejo, has denied any 
wrongdoing.

A YEAR LATER, DAMAGE WROUGHT BY LANDSLIDE REMAINS; DISASTER: SAN CLEMENTE 
VICTIMS WHOSE HOMES WERE DESTROYED SEE LITTLE PROGRESS DESPITE A REBUILDING 
AGREEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Tuesday was an anniversary Peter Shikli and his neighbors would rather forget. 
</P>
<P>
 One year ago, their San Clemente bluff top collapsed with a frightening crack, 
toppling three homes to Pacific Coast Highway 75 feet below and destroying 
three other residences. 
</P>
<P>
 From the look of the ruins today, little has changed since the night of the 
big landslide. The damaged homes remain in pieces and 40,000 tons of rubble, 
now surrounded by a rusting chain-link fence, still block the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 After a year of wrangling, the cities of Dana Point and San Clemente finally 
have agreed to help the California Department of Transportation repair the 
broken hillside, but for Shikli and the others, life will never be the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what kind of changes a 
person goes through when they find their belongings on the street and their 
half-million-dollar homes destroyed. . . . It did a lot of life wrecking is 
what it did," Shikli said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, added Shikli, 43, a computer programmer who had lived with his wife, 
Edith, in the 2800 block of La Ventana for eight years: "Are we at a point 
where it has defeated us? I don't think it has. We are on a major adventure 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one then understood how bad it would turn out, there had been 
warnings of trouble along the La Ventana bluffs, the homeowners recall. As far 
back as 1992, a small chunk of the hillside owned by Lois Schwartz and Michael 
Makajesian collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Then on Jan. 17, a month before the slide, another piece of Makajesian's back 
yard fell down to the highway. By late last February, gaping cracks began to 
snake through several homes on La Ventana, foreshadowing what was to come on 
the night of Feb. 22, said Jim Holloway, San Clemente's director of community 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the others, Shikli remembers exactly what he was doing about 11 p.m., an 
hour that seems frozen in time. He and his wife were across the street at the 
home of John and Diane Cox, where they had spent several hours socializing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a loud explosion, kind of a rumbling," Shikli said. "We started 
creeping across the street and felt a lot of wind in our faces from where our 
house used to be. Bits of glass were breaking and there were a lot of flashes 
from power lines dropping toward the bottom of the hill." 
</P>
<P>
 Next door to the Shikli house, Richard Vaughn had already decided to pack his 
things. After spending the day moving furniture to the rear of the house, an 
exhausted Vaughn, now 55, had just sat down to listen to opera. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was listening to some opera so my nerves would calm down a little bit," 
said Vaughn, who lived on La Ventana for 10 years. "Then down it went." 
</P>
<P>
 Although an agreement on a $3.1-million plan to rebuild the bluffs and clear 
the highway was reached earlier this month, city officials acknowledge it has 
been a bureaucratic nightmare, largely because of the number of jurisdictions 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The La Ventana homes were in San Clemente, but fell down into Dana Point, 
covering a state highway and the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government is involved because it is paying 80% of the repair 
bill. Officials hope work to shore up the bluff and reopen the highway will be 
completed in June, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides homeowners, some business owners along the highway are eager for the 
work to be done. Currently, traffic is detoured away from their stores and they 
have complained of economic hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some parties marvel that progress has been made. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to get six homeowners to agree to the fine print, two cities, Caltrans 
and the" Federal Highway Administration, Holloway said.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Shikli of the negotiations: "It was a monument to cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Tuesday it was "hard to say" how many of the other homeowners will 
rebuild on La Ventana.

DECIDING ON LIFE OR DEATH FOR O.C.'S WORST MURDERERS; JUSTICE: PROSECUTORS MEET 
IN SECRET TO WEIGH EVIDENCE, IMPACT ON JURY. CRITICS LIKEN PROCESS TO 'STAR 
CHAMBER.' 
</P>

 In one of Orange County's ghastliest murders, a La Habra janitor is accused of 
walking into a Tustin office last year and dousing a woman with gasoline before 
setting her on fire. If Jonathan D'Arcy is convicted, prosecutors will seek the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 In another case that shocked the county, Robert Chan, 19, is the alleged 
ringleader in the 1992 New Year's Eve murder of a high school honor student who 
was bludgeoned and buried in a Buena Park back yard. Prosecutors want Chan to 
spend the rest of his life in prison if he is convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Such decrees on who should live and who should face the death penalty are 
reached each month in Orange County -- but far from a courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the decision whether to seek a death sentence against those charged 
with Orange County's most heinous killings is made by an elite group of veteran 
prosecutors who gather in secret for high-stakes sessions, taking evidence and 
weighing the odds before reaching a critical verdict that is usually endorsed 
by judges and juries. 
</P>
<P>
 In coming weeks, the panel of prosecutors will consider the fate of a Dana 
Point postal worker accused of gunning down his mother and his best friend 
during a shooting rampage across Orange County, and a Westminster survivalist 
charged with shooting two women to death at an embroidery shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Many defense attorneys praise Orange County prosecutors for their sensitivity 
in singling out only the most aggravated cases for death sentences. But others 
complain that California law allows each county too much discretion because 
there are no uniform guidelines for deciding to seek a death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others liken the process in Orange County to a "Star Chamber proceeding" 
-- a reference to a royal English court long abolished but notorious for secret 
sessions and harsh judgments. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Dist. Atty. John D. Conley, the panel's ranking prosecutor who makes 
the final determination, said he's just interested in following the law. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 22-year career, he has become all too familiar with the savage work of 
serial killers, brutal rapist-murderers and those who prey on children. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no joy in doing this," said Conley, who sees his role as seeking 
justice on behalf of those silenced in death. "I often think about what the 
victims went through in the last moments of their lives." What Tips the Scales 
</P>
<P>
 The committee must weigh which defendants deserve to die for their crimes and 
whether 12 jurors are likely to agree before pursuing cases that typically cost 
taxpayers millions. 
</P>
<P>
 They methodically consider factors that might tip the scales of justice in 
favor of life -- or death -- including the suffering of the victims, the 
defendant's age and previous criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cases are easy to decide, such as that of Randy Steven Kraft, the Long 
Beach computer consultant sentenced in 1989 to die for killing 16 Orange County 
men and boys, Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
 While prosecutors refused to discuss pending trials, Chan's case clearly 
proved more troublesome than most. The death penalty could have been sought in 
Chan's case, but some attorneys said they thought a jury would be reluctant to 
condemn a young man who was a onetime contender for class valedictorian. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee decided recently to seek the death penalty against D'Arcy. 
Authorities allege that his victim, bookkeeper Karen LaBorde, 42, of Orange, 
died a torturous death after she was set on fire following a dispute over a 
$150 check D'Arcy claimed was owed him. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by the Special Circumstances Committee -- a panel of seven men 
who have nearly 125 years of prosecuting experience combined -- is just one 
step in the process that can lead to the gas chamber or death by lethal 
injection. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the final decision, but in many ways it's the most critical point in 
the whole process, because they have the discretion," said Associate Prof. 
William Thompson, who specializes in death penalty issues at UC Irvine. "It's 
also the process that we have the least information about." 
</P>
<P>
 A defendant is condemned only after a jury and judge agree that death is 
appropriate, and death sentences are automatically appealed to California 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics show that jurors usually endorse the prosecution's request for the 
death penalty. In 37 capital cases prosecuted in Orange County since 1984, 
jurors have spared the lives of convicted murderers in nine instances. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, Orange County ranks third behind Los Angeles and Alameda counties 
in condemning killers to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 381 inmates currently on death row, 27 men and one woman were sentenced 
by Orange County judges, according to a recent analysis by the state Department 
of Correction. Orange County killers account for 7.2% of death row inmates. 
First Line of Defense 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys are not required to appear before the prosecution panel but 
they typically do. Despite concerns that prosecutors may use the meetings to 
gain insights into possible defense strategies, attorneys rarely give up the 
opportunity to plead for a client's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really see this as a bargain with the devil," said Assistant Public 
Defender Michael P. Giannini, who has appeared before the panel several times 
and likened the process to a star chamber. "Unless you change their minds, 
there is no advantage for you as the defense attorney. But you just can't pass 
on that chance." 
</P>
<P>
 The tone of the hearings is always intense and emotionally draining, defense 
attorneys say. Prosecutors are seated around a conference table. Sometimes 
defense attorneys are peppered with questions. Other times, prosecutors just 
listen. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just sit there like a group of Sphinxes, they are very hard to read, 
there are very few clues to what they are thinking, but it is not unfriendly, 
there is no animosity," said defense attorney Jennifer Keller, who has twice 
appeared before the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys present anything and everything that might sway the 
prosecutors -- or a jury -- including the facts of the case as they see them, 
details about the defendant's upbringing, abuse suffered as a child or 
psychiatric evaluations. 
</P>
<P>
 Some attorneys briefly state why death is not appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've also had presentations where there are videotaped statements from 
friends and relatives, paintings, drawings and poetry (by the defendant), 
certificates of merit, report cards, photo albums," said prosecutor Rick King, 
head of the homicide unit of the district attorney's office and chairman of the 
death-penalty panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, defense attorneys are successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can say there are times where I believe a case is a death-penalty case, but 
I have changed my mind listening to a defense attorney," King said. He declined 
to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee meets and deliberates behind closed doors. Defense attorneys are 
notified of the outcome in a a one-sentence form letter -- delivered by mail -- 
and sometimes called a "death letter." No explanation is offered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not knowing always bothers me," said Keller, who unable to persuade the panel 
to spare D'Arcy's life because of his troubled mental history. "I would like to 
be given more information about what were the deciding factors. I would like to 
see the whole process opened up more to the public." A Dearth of Diversity 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the way prosecutors decide death-penalty cases varies from county 
to county. In some instances, a single prosecutor decides whether capital 
punishment will be sought. Critics call for statewide, uniform guidelines on 
making such determinations. Some also criticize the lack of diversity on the 
Orange County panel, whose members are all white males. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 28 Orange County prisoners on death row, 16 are white, seven are 
Latino, three are black, one is Native American and one is Asian. 
</P>
<P>
 "Diversity is important in everything, especially a decision like this," said 
Sacramento attorney James Thomson, president of California Attorneys for 
Criminal Justice, who said he has concerns that factors such as race or 
economic status can play a role in determining whom is targeted for a death 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, only experienced prosecutors who have tried death penalty 
cases are eligible for the panel. As the office's two female homicide 
prosecutors and other deputies gain more experience, the makeup of the panel 
will change, ranking prosecutor Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No doubt (diversity) would add an extra dimension," Conley said. "But we 
believe experience in determining whether death is appropriate, or predicting 
how a jury will react, is more important than whether a man or a woman is 
involved" in making the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Some defense attorneys said that some murder victims appear to be given more 
"worth" than others when prosecutors are weighing a death penalty case. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know when you have a murder involving a child, it's 'killing time' " for 
the defendant, public defender Giannini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all else, Conley said, prosecutors strive to be fair and consistent, 
judging each case on the facts and the law. Before the panel's inception in 
1985, the decision to seek the death penalty often was left to the prosecutor 
who took the case to trial, Conley said. The panel was formed to ensure 
uniformity and provide the viewpoints of more experienced prosecutors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a weighing process and everyone is treated equally," Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I have the final say, it's very much a group process, and I think we 
benefit from the long collective memory -- and the collective wisdom -- of 
experienced prosecutors," he said, adding that panel members sometimes 
disagree, but the majority's sentiments usually prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's judgment is sometimes called into question by a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, a jury deliberated one day before sparing the life of Shaleke Nasir, 
22, a kick boxer from Orange who was convicted of first-degree murder for 
bludgeoning, robbing and attempting to rape his girlfriend, Lena M. Forbes, 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors said that while Nasir's crime was heinous, he did not deserve death. 
His sentencing is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors involved in the process say their decisions are never made without 
careful deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the most important things I do as a prosecutor," said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Robert C. Gannon Jr., head of the major fraud and consumer 
protection unit, who has also prosecuted numerous homicide and death-penalty 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very serious undertaking," King said. "It's a tremendous 
responsibility to know that you are participating in a decision that has as its 
consequence the taking of a life." Deciding on Death 
</P>
<P>
 The Special Circumstances Committee of the Orange County district attorney's 
office reviews certain aggravated murder cases to decide whether prosecutors 
will seek a death sentence during trial. A jury and judge must agree before a 
defendant will be condemned. 
</P>
<P>

U.S. ORDERS NEW ROUND OF CABLE TV RATE CUTS; REGULATION: O.C. OPERATORS 
SCRAMBLE TO ASSESS IMPACT OF 7% REDUCTION, SECOND SUCH ACTION IN LESS THAN A 
YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal regulators voted unanimously Tuesday to order a new round of cable 
television rate cuts, slashing another 7% after a previous round of cuts 
partially backfired. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's second attempt in less than a year to lower prices for the 
nation's 58 million cable subscribers comes after consumers and economists 
criticized the Federal Communications Commission over the effectiveness of the 
first rate cut, which unexpectedly produced increases in monthly fees for 
millions of subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rules, which impose an overall 17% rate reduction -- an additional 7% 
on top of last year's 10% cut -- could complicate ambitious plans announced by 
many cable companies, such as Tele-Communications Inc. and Time Warner Inc., to 
spend billions of dollars to replace their copper wires with higher-capacity 
fiber-optic cable. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County cable operators scrambled Tuesday to assess what impact the new 
rules would have on their bottom lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Most said they needed time to gauge the effect of the complex regulation 
changes, which come at a time when many cable systems are expanding program 
offerings and adding services, such as interactive programming. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FCC itself said its ruling is very complex and it's impossible to 
determine at this time how it will impact a particular subscriber's bill," said 
John Gibbs, vice president of Continental Cablevision, which serves parts of 
Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy M. Keegan, a vice president of the California Cable TV Assn., said the 
rollback could hamper the industry's ability to compete against emerging 
competitors such as regional telephone companies and even newer providers that 
plan to deliver cable programming to consumers via satellite, microwave and 
other technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 But many consumer advocates praised the FCC's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like it's a moderate victory for consumers," said Bradley Stillman, 
legislative director for the Consumer Federation of America. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the revisions are successful, they will be greeted very well here," said 
Lee Risner, city manager of La Habra, who is a Century Cable customer. He said 
he has had nearly 300 complaints about cable bills rising since September. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge for basic cable rose from $16 to $24 there, Risner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Herman, general manager for the Los Angeles Department of 
Telecommunications, which regulates cable providers, said the FCC's first 
attempt at rate regulation left too many loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
 Century Cable, for example, which serves parts of West Los Angeles, Sherman 
Oaks and Eagle Rock, used the new rules to reduce the number of channels on its 
basic service, choosing instead to offer several "a la carte" packages for 
which subscribers had to pay extra, Herman said, adding, "It was a way to 
charge consumers more for less." 
</P>
<P>
 Century officials were unavailable for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Sept. 1, Los Angeles residents have seen their rates go up an average of 
80 cents a month, while the number of channels provided fell, on average, from 
44 to 42, Herman said. Lee Risner, city manager of La Habra, said he has 
received nearly 300 complaints about higher cable bills since September. 
</P>
<P>
 But things may be different this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FCC seems to have recognized that the rates they set the first time 
around were in essence too low, and made it too easy for cable companies to 
evade the intent of the law," Herman said. "Consumers were really beginning to 
feel gouged." 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's the cable operators' turn to feel gouged. Says Marc Nathanson, head 
of Los Angeles-based Falcon Cable, the state's largest independent cable 
operator: "It's like rent control coming into your building." 
</P>
<P>
 Nathanson, whose firm serves subscribers in Malibu and San Bernardino, said 
consumers may lose out in the long term as cable operators are forced to scale 
back plans to upgrade plants and provide expanded services such as multichannel 
pay-per-view and interactive entertainment, news and educational programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other cable operators, Falcon is planning to upgrade its network 
with fiber optics that can squeeze 300 channels into the space once occupied by 
50, at a cost of $300 to $600 per subscriber. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathanson blamed the "idiotically written bill" for the fact that rates went 
up for 30% of his customers. The original ruling prevented operators from 
charging for extra outlets and remote controls. As a result, most of the 
subscribers whose rates went down were those who had multiple televisions, and 
those whose went up were the ones who could least afford it, Nathanson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC on Tuesday closed many loopholes that had allowed cable operators to 
boost monthly fees. The reduction covers all channels except pay-per-view and 
premium services like HBO, Showtime and Encore. But last-minute lobbying by 
cable operators won concessions for small cable operators. And reconfiguration 
of cable program packages may mean not all consumers will see a 7% drop once 
the latest price cut takes effect in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, FCC Chairman Reed E. Hundt, asserting that the government has 
finally "broken the back of cable price increases," claimed the new rules will 
save consumers $3 billion a year and will be backed by tough enforcement 
measures against violators. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the greatest consumer savings in the history of American business 
regulation," Hundt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the sweeping claim, the complex new cable rules could end up creating 
more confusion and delivering less than advertised. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10% of the nation's 11,000 cable operators already charge prices below 
the new ceiling, so they can maintain their prices. And 3 million cable 
subscribers get service from small operators, who will not immediately face 
pricing restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the new rules apply only to cable systems not subject to 
effective competition. Currently only a handful of communities, including about 
12 in California, have effective competition in the form of two or more cable 
systems serving the same area. 
</P>
<P>
 But emerging competitors, such as Hughes Aircraft Co.'s new direct-broadcast 
satellite system, could be operating in many communities soon. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, like the previous rules, the new regulations cover only basic 
cable, a level that ordinarily includes local broadcast channels and public 
access and government channels. The regulation of basic rates would be handled 
by local officials after they request, permission from the FCC, as most of 
Orange County's cities have done. Prices for premium channels and pay-per-view 
events remain unregulated. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Wilson, acting head of the FCC's cable services bureau, said the agency 
will apply its new pricing rules to non-premium cable channels such as CNN and 
MTV. And, she said, the agency will order sanctions against cable operators 
that reconfigure their program packages not to "enhance customer choice" but 
"to evade pricing regulation." 
</P>
<P>
 Upset by escalating rates and poor service, Congress passed a cable act in 
1992 with the intent of mandating service improvements, lower prices and more 
competition. When the FCC announced a rollback of cable rates last April -- 
mandated by the act -- the agency said its goal was to cut cable bills an 
average of 10% and save consumers $1 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 10 months following those cuts, the nation's 25 largest cable operators 
reported to the FCC that the average regulated revenue per subscriber declined 
to $24.11 per month from $25.61, a drop of 5.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the FCC survey of these 25 cable operators found that 30.5% of their 
subscribers received increases in their regulated cable fee. 
</P>
<P>
 In south Orange County, about a dozen cities served by Dimension Cable have 
agreed to collectively hire a consultant to review that operator's rates. The 
cities plan to interview consultant candidates today, said Damian Hopp, 
assistant to the city manager in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Dimension's cable fee to the city rose 1.8% between the third and 
fourth quarters last year, indicating an increase in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Dimension Cable did not return telephone calls seeking a response. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that working together (to hire a consultant) will give our action 
greater weight," Hopp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shiver reported from Washington, Harmon from Los Angeles. Times staff writer 
Anne Michaud in Orange County also contributed to this report. Cable Comparison 
</P>
<P>
 A Federal Communications Commission ruling requires cable television companies 
to cut basic service prices 7% by mid-May. Cable company representatives said 
further study of the ruling would be needed before the new rates can be 
determined. Here's a look at Orange County's monthly rates:

FRIENDS DESCRIBE SUSPECT AS A TROUBLED DRUG USER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS and SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A portrait of a disturbed, drug-abusing teen who had previously talked of 
killing his father emerged Tuesday in the hours after police say the youth shot 
his father, a rookie police officer and finally himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends described 17-year-old Christopher Golly as a quiet boy and an 
undisciplined student who had developed a daily habit of snorting crystal 
Methedrine, a highly addictive form of amphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was into speed pretty bad," said James Carieri, 18, a friend in a tightly 
knit group of teen-agers who met at Granada Hills High School, where Chris was 
a student until May. "It made him really pumped, really amped. I also think it 
messed up his head, because sometimes he was on the crazy side." 
</P>
<P>
 During the past several months, Carieri said that Chris told several close 
friends that he had been on the verge of killing his father and only stopped 
himself because he was too frightened. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thought about it a lot," Carieri said. "He had a lot of pretty serious 
fistfights with his dad, and would later call (me) up and say, 'I almost did 
it. I almost did it.' . . . He didn't do it because he didn't have the nerve, I 
guess. But it was just a matter of when." 
</P>
<P>
 Until December, Chris had been enrolled at a continuation school, West Granada 
High School, after he had transferred there from Granada Hills High School in 
May. At the regular high school, he had been unable to keep up with assignments 
because he frequently skipped classes, friends and school officials said. In 
January he left the continuation school to begin a home-study program. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't like school," said Scott Weingarten, 17, who had known Chris about 
three years. "If he went to school, he'd do good, but he didn't go much. But 
nobody really likes school." 
</P>
<P>
 In his truancy and many other ways, Chris was a typical teen-ager. He liked 
playing video games and pool and he and his friends favored "speed metal," a 
driving, guitar-based music that is a marriage between punk and heavy metal. He 
and many of his male friends wore haircuts closely cropped on the sides and 
long on top. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris, however, had frequently clashed with his father, Steven Golly, an 
electrical equipment supplier, who had a reputation for being a strict 
disciplinarian. The two lived in a Northridge house on Amestoy Avenue with 
another woman and her son. Chris' mother, Pamela Golly, died several years ago 
while she and his father were going through a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest Reepmaker, Pamela Golly's father, said his daughter suffered from a 
drug problem and died of an overdose in October, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 One neighbor, Alexander Frankel -- who lived around the corner from the Gollys 
for more than 15 years -- said Steven Golly was an unfriendly, humorless 
neighbor who used to treat the family dog roughly during walks, grabbing the 
animal by the collar and yanking him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought he would be a difficult father," said Frankel's wife, 
Shirley. "My youngest son is 27 and when he was a little kid Steve caught him 
throwing rocks into his pool and chastised him severely. He was very cross with 
children, really a stern individual." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the friction between them, Steven Golly had bought his son two cars, 
friends said. First, a souped-up gray 1968 Camaro that was later stolen and, 
more recently, a Chevy S-10 pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighboring twins Jeff and Jason Feger, 13, said they had known Chris as long 
as they can remember, and for years he was a pal. 
</P>
<P>
 As youngsters, they traded baseball cards, watched videos together and played 
baseball in the street in front of their homes. They said Chris was a bright 
kid in elementary school and junior high. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chris had always enjoyed showing off his father's guns, about 10 of which 
were kept in a gun case in the living room, "along with plenty of ammo," said 
Jeff Feger. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said his Dad was a Vietnam vet," Feger said. "They seemed like a nice, 
average family." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two years, some neighbors said Chris began acting the part of a 
tough kid -- ditching school, neglecting his studies and using drugs. The two 
boys said they had had little to do with him since then. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbor Feri Niaki said Chris had scared her two weeks ago while he was 
shooting at a bird's nest in her back yard with a pistol. She yelled at him to 
stop but then fled inside her house, frightened that he might point the gun at 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 As he waited to be interviewed at the Devonshire police station Tuesday 
morning, Matt Conner said he was Chris' best friend and had been at the 
family's house Monday night when Chris and his father were arguing. Conner said 
Chris was angry, talking about getting back at his father, perhaps even killing 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to talk him out of it," Conner said. "He said he wasn't going to do 
it; to shoot his father. They were having problems. They were arguing. Family 
matters. He just said he had had enough. He snapped, basically." 
</P>
<P>
 Later Tuesday, at a McDonald's restaurant in Chatsworth, a dozen or so of 
Chris' friends described him as being caring and protective. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wouldn't let no one do anything to his friends," said Larry Carlin, a 
Granada Hills High senior. "He would give you a ride if you needed it, 
whatever." 
</P>
<P>
 "And he was cute," another friend chimed in. 
</P>
<P>
 When Carlin heard on the radio that a 17-year-old had been at the center of 
the rampage, he said: "I was laughing about it at first, like, 'This . . . gets 
crazy.' Then I heard the name, and I go, 'No way.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But two friends of Golly's who stopped by the house Tuesday after the shooting 
described Chris as a daily drug user, a guy who liked to party -- first with 
beer and pot -- then, starting at the end of summer, with methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sold speed to his little buddies," in relatively small amounts, said Jamie 
Kushner, 18. "He wasn't big time. But he was definitely hooked. He's been doing 
it maybe six months." 
</P>
<P>
 Kushner said Golly loved to snort the powdered drug, a stimulant that can keep 
users awake for days but can cause serious health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher and his friends had a particular penchant for a type of speed 
known as "Pink Champagne," because of its color, which sells for about $20 per 
quarter of a gram -- enough, friends said, to get high at least five times. 
</P>
<P>
 Kushner said he met Golly because the two were part of a group of local teens 
who shared interests in drugs, alcohol and music. He recalled that Golly loved 
bands such as Pantera, Ministry and Metallica, whose loud, aggressive rock 'n' 
roll make them a favorite of mostly teen-age boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We partied," Kushner said. "That was our relationship. We had real good 
times, teen-age stuff. We drank our beer, smoked our weed." 
</P>
<P>
 Kushner and Carieri, both students at West Valley Occupational Center, said 
Chris had been arrested last year for possession of marijuana, but, because he 
was a minor, his punishment was a suspended license. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither teen had met Chris' father and were only at the house when Chris' 
parents were gone, including an occasional house party thrown by Chris. 
</P>
<P>
 But up until the shooting, Golly's troubles with his Dad seemed pretty 
typical, said Carieri. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just went off, went crazy," Carieri said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both youths said they didn't talk with Chris about future plans beyond an 
upcoming party or concert. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is that he was supposed to go to Pink Floyd on April 17," Carieri 
said.

POLICEWOMAN WAS STANDOUT AT ACADEMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She was a 45-year-old mother of two, by far the oldest police rookie in her 
class. Her father was a retired Los Angeles police detective. And recently, 
Christy Lynne Hamilton's classmates in the Police Academy voted her the most 
inspirational new officer -- an honor named after slain cop Tina Kerbrat. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Hamilton's name again was linked with Kerbrat's as she became the 
second woman in LAPD history to be killed in the line of duty. Only four days 
before, Hamilton was standing proudly next to her father as she finally 
realized her dream, which came late in life, to follow in his footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Kenneth L. Brondell, had planned to meet his daughter Tuesday 
morning for breakfast and "to shoot the breeze," he said. Instead, he found 
himself at a Northridge hospital, hearing the words a police officer's family 
dreads most: His daughter had fallen while in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those offering solace was Police Chief Willie L. Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chief, you've lost a good one with Christy," Brondell responded. "You had a 
mature, compassionate, intelligent person who had lived life already, and made 
it to the age of 45 and decided to start her career at that point." 
</P>
<P>
 He would later tell a reporter that "for the first time in my life, I feel 
sorry I was ever a police officer." 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled how his former wife had warned him against encouraging their 
daughter to wear a badge. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was not happy about Christy becoming a police officer because of the 
danger," he said, stopping to regain his composure, "which makes me feel 
guilty. I had a lot of influence on her." 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of her slaying, Hamilton was being mourned throughout the 
department she and her father loved. The terrible coincidences linking her name 
to Kerbrat's were well understood at the Devonshire station, where officers -- 
like others throughout the city -- wore black mourning bands across their 
police badges in memory of their slain colleague. 
</P>
<P>
 In just a few short weeks, they said, Hamilton had endeared herself to them 
like few others. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a breath of fresh air," said Lt. Dan Hoffman, who 20 years ago had 
served with Hamilton's father in the San Fernando Valley. "She was a pleasure 
to have here. Her father and mother were extremely proud of her." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in 1948, Hamilton grew up in North Hollywood before attending Valley 
Junior College. She left school to marry Richard Steven, with whom she had a 
son and a daughter, and worked at his family's nursery business in North 
Hollywood for 16 years, until just before she entered the Police Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 After divorcing Steven, she married Harold Hamilton, a Los Angeles city 
firefighter, in 1977. The couple were in the process of getting divorced at the 
time of her death. 
</P>
<P>
 Christy Hamilton is survived by a daughter, Kelly, 24, and a son, William, 21, 
from her first marriage, and two stepsons, Lance Hamilton and Jody Hamilton, 
from her second marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton had long wanted to follow her father into the Los Angeles Police 
Department, but had all but given up because of her age. She had gone back to 
school, earning a liberal arts degree from Cal State Northridge in December, 
1992. Then, in October, her father called and told her that the LAPD had lifted 
the age ceiling so people over 34 could apply. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did and just followed it through, and here I am," she told reporters at her 
graduation last Friday. "My father was a Los Angeles police officer for 30 
years. I always wanted to be a police officer, but I got married when I was 19 
(and) started a family, and my life sort of changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton was voted most inspirational in her class by her peers, who cited her 
upbeat attitude and perseverance. Colleagues said she endured the physical and 
mental rigors of police training that many men half her age couldn't withstand. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very positive," said Nick Fotiades, the Police Academy's senior 
training officer for Hamilton's class. "She just hung in there. She never 
quit." 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Michael Reyes, leader of Hamilton's graduating class, said her 
toughest challenge was purely physical -- making it through the obstacle course 
and scaling the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Determined to succeed, Reyes said Hamilton would go out on the obstacle course 
early and even constructed a makeshift wall at her Thousand Oaks home to help 
her improve. 
</P>
<P>
 "She really didn't allow her age to play a factor," said Reyes. "She was there 
to become an LAPD officer." 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, Hamilton was struggling with the rigors of training. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes," her father recalled, "she felt as if she didn't know if she could 
make it. . . . You don't become a cop unless you go over that wall. Sure 
enough, a couple of days later, she pulled into the driveway, ran inside and 
said, 'Tell dad I went over the wall.' She did it." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time of graduation, Hamilton not only had conquered the obstacle course 
but won the admiration of her classmates and family. Reyes remembered meeting 
Hamilton's family at a pre-graduation breakfast last Friday, and how she and 
her father had beamed at each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was on cloud nine," he said. "She was extremely proud of her father, and 
he was extremely proud of her." 
</P>
<P>
 Called up early with her other classmates because of the earthquake, Hamilton 
had already been on the street for a month. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Tuesday, Hamilton's father remembered how proud he was of his 
daughter when she walked down the aisle at graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, becoming a cop was something Hamilton told friends she wanted 
for herself, not for her father. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was the most self-disciplined and determined person I ever met," said her 
brother, Kenneth Brondell Jr. "If she got it in her mind to do something, she 
was going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 As news of Hamilton's death spread through the ranks Tuesday, her classmates 
began dropping in to the academy to console each other and remember the woman 
who had come so far. 
</P>
<P>
 At Parker Center, headquarters for the LAPD, flags were ordered to fly at half 
staff; just days earlier they were lowered in memory of two Palos Verdes 
officers who were shot and killed earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 After a moment of silence at the weekly Police Commission meeting, Police 
Chief Williams recounted his conversation with the rookie officer's father at 
the hospital that morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Los Angeles Police Department will never know the type of officer it lost 
this morning," Williams said Hamilton's father told him. "Only her family will 
know." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Harold, was too grief-stricken to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Others remembered Hamilton as "the mother" of her Police Academy class who 
never lost touch with her old friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugo Martinez, manager of Stevens Nursery where Hamilton had worked so long, 
said Hamilton dropped by Monday night "just like old times" to chat with her 
former co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was visiting her friends here on the way to the police station, talking 
about the demands that her new job required and letting us know how happy she 
was to be a police officer," Martinez said. "She always said it was what she 
wanted to do."

JUDGE RULES MAN FIT TO STAND TRIAL; COURTS: LA HABRA JANITOR FACES A POSSIBLE 
DEATH SENTENCE IF CONVICTED OF SETTING A BOOKKEEPER ON FIRE AFTER A DISPUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A La Habra janitor accused of setting a bookkeeper on fire after a dispute 
over a $150 check is mentally fit to stand trial for murder, a judge ruled 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Daniel D'Arcy, 31, faces a possible death sentence if convicted of 
the Feb. 2, 1993, death of Karen Marie LaBorde, 42, of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald had ordered D'Arcy to 
undergo a 90-day psychiatric evaluation after expressing concern that while 
D'Arcy understood the nature of the charges against him, he might not have the 
mental ability to assist in his own defense. 
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing reports from the evaluation, Fitzgerald determined Tuesday 
that prosecutors can go forward with their capital case against D'Arcy. A trial 
is expected later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Paul G. Stark, who recently began defending D'Arcy, declined 
to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychiatrists have determined that D'Arcy suffers from paranoid delusions and 
court records show he has a history of criminal arrests and violent behavior. 
Recently, D'Arcy had told the judge he wanted to act as his own attorney, a 
request that was denied. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Molko said it is not unusual for a defendant to have 
mental difficulties while also being found mentally competent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you couldn't do this, anyone with a mental problem could never be tried," 
Molko said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before her death, LaBorde worked for a Tustin building maintenance company to 
support her two teen-age children and an unemployed husband. D'Arcy was a 
contract maintenance worker for the company and was enraged over a late payment 
of $150 he claimed the company owed him, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said D'Arcy forced his way into LaBorde's office, doused her with 
gasoline from a plastic drink container and then walked away as flames engulfed 
her. The bookkeeper suffered burns on over 95% of her body and died shortly 
after the attack, officials said.

UMBERG MEASURE TARGETS PAROLE VIOLATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With voters voicing a chorus of frustration over the state's parole system, 
Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) introduced legislation Tuesday that 
would dramatically toughen penalties for parolees who violate the terms of 
their parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Under existing law, parolees can be returned to prison for a maximum of one 
year if they are caught violating terms of their parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg's bill would lengthen the minimum to at least two years. The measure 
would also give a judge the discretion to return a felon to prison to serve out 
the remainder of a sentence if he or she had been released early for good 
behavior or "work time." In some cases, that could mean a parolee going back 
for a decade or more in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill was a response to recommendations made in a recently released report 
on prison operations by the Little Hoover Commission, a state panel that 
investigates a wide range of issues. The study determined that the state's 
existing parole system is being abused by career criminals who have little fear 
of reprisal if they violate the terms of parole set down when they are released 
from prison. 
</P>
<P>
 An Assembly committee chaired by Umberg that is studying prison operations 
determined in a recent hearing that the value of parole is dubious, citing 
slayings and other violent crimes committed by parolees who should have been in 
prison because of parole violations.

ASSAULT RIFLE USED IN KILLINGS MAY HAVE BEEN ON BANNED LIST; WEAPONS: GUN IS 
IDENTIFIED AS AN AR-15 SEMIAUTOMATIC, A TYPE COPIED IN SEVERAL MODELS. WHILE 
SOME ARE LEGAL IN CALIFORNIA, OTHERS ARE NOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The semiautomatic rifle used in Tuesday's killing of rookie Los Angeles 
Policewoman Christy Lynne Hamilton may have been on the list of assault weapons 
that are generally banned for sale in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Chief Willie Williams identified the weapon used by the 
teen-ager believed to have been the gunman in the Northridge shooting as an 
AR-15 semiautomatic assault rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 The AR-15 is a rifle manufactured by Colt but also copied in several models by 
various companies. It is often called the civilian version of the M-16, a 
semiautomatic assault rifle used by some of the U. S. Armed Forces. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the AR-15 is a medium-powered, .223-caliber rifle capable of 
carrying between five and 20 rounds of ammunition, several gun experts said. It 
has been used in competitive shooting and has been coveted by gun collectors 
ever since the M-16 emerged in the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 While some of these types of rifles are legal in California, others are not. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an area where there is a lot of confusion," conceded Michael 
Broderick, manager of the California Department of Justice's firearms program. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's landmark Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989 specifically outlawed 
the sale to civilians of dozens of assault guns, including the AR-15s 
manufactured by Hartford, Conn.-based Colt Manufacturing Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, AR-15 refers to the Colt AR-15," said state Sen. David A. Roberti 
(D-Van Nuys), who co-authored the weapons-control legislation with former 
Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 While the sale of the Colt AR-15 is now generally against the law, thousands 
of Californians still own them legally. The 1989 law allowed civilians to keep 
any of the weapons that were banned if the weapons had been legally acquired 
before June 1, 1989. Owners, however, were required to register them. 
</P>
<P>
 About 62,000 assault weapons of all kinds are registered with the state, 
Broderick said. While he did not know the exact number of Colt AR-15s, he said, 
"it is one of our two biggest categories." 
</P>
<P>
 But the ban on the Colt AR-15 merely prompted gun makers to become more 
creative, Roberti said. "At least seven or eight copycats have been 
manufactured," primarily since the weapons-control law took effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The copycats look the same and function the same, he said. "I'm told the only 
difference is the trigger mechanism on the copycats isn't interchangeable." 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular AR-15 copycat is the Colt Sporter, Roberti said, adding that 
ironically Connecticut banned the sale and possession of the Sporter in that 
state in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 California Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren filed a lawsuit in 1991, calling the Colt 
Sporter a Colt AR-15 look-alike and redesign of the same gun. Colt and other 
manufacturers responded by challenging the constitutionality of the 1989 
weapons act, and sought to prevent the attorney general from adding any other 
guns to the list of banned weapons until the constitutional question was 
decided. 
</P>
<P>
 In late December, the Superior Court in Sacramento decided that the weapons 
act was constitutional. While Colt and the other plaintiffs may still appeal 
that decision, Lungren is now free to "go forward and add additional assault 
weapons to those already banned," Deputy Atty. Gen. Paul Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti urged Lungren to add facsimile weapons to the list soon and to "make 
it as expansive as reasonably possible." 
</P>
<P>
 "The AR-15 series of weapons are very dangerous and all that come within that 
series should be prohibited," Roberti said. "What more do we need than the 
tragic death of Police Officer Christy Hamilton in order to emphasize that 
point?" Violence Against Police 
</P>
<P>
 IN CALIFORNIA 
</P>
<P>
 The number of police officers killed and assaulted in the line of duty in 
California has fluctuated over the last several years. An assault is defined as 
serious injury to an officer, or the use of a dangerous weapon or substantial 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 IN THE U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of officers killed in the line of duty has decreased since a peak 
of 134 in 1973. The rates for all assaults -- ranging from mere threats to the 
actual battering of officers -- has fluctuated. 03,06,17,20 Number of Number of 
assaults officers killed per 100 officers 1986 66 16.9 1987 74 16.8 1988 78 
15.9 1989 66 16.4 1990 66 17.4 1991 71 15.5 1992 62 17.6 Note: Accidental 
deaths are not included.

JACK NICHOLSON ACCUSED OF BREAKING MAN'S WINDSHIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Los Angeles man is suing actor Jack Nicholson for allegedly smashing the 
windshield of his Mercedes Benz during a traffic dispute at a Studio City 
intersection, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Scott Blank filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court against the 
movie star this month alleging assault and battery, infliction of emotional 
distress and false imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Department Detective Robert Searle said the department is 
also investigating the Feb. 8 incident and the city attorney's office may 
determine this week to file a misdemeanor vandalism charge against the actor. 
The maximum sentence is six months in jail and or a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls to Nicholson's agent, Sandy Bresler, were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Searle said what began as an argument apparently escalated into a 
confrontation at an intersection between Moorpark Street and Riverside Drive in 
Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a crime report filed with the LAPD, Nicholson got out of his car 
at a red light and ran over to Blank's Mercedes with a metal pipe, possibly a 
golf club, Searle said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The actor struck Blank's car several times, shattering his windshield and 
"causing it to spray glass all over the interior of the car," causing Blank to 
"fear for his life," according to the lawsuit. The confrontation ended when 
Nicholson got back inside his own Mercedes and drove away with an unidentified 
male passenger, Searle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blank and a witness, however, recognized Nicholson and jotted down the license 
plate number to his car. Searle said the plate number matched the number of the 
actor's Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the incident, Blank had physical injuries and nervous pain and 
suffering, according to the lawsuit. He is seeking an unspecified amount of 
general and punitive damages, according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles E. Ruben, an attorney representing Blank, declined to elaborate on the 
details leading up to the confrontation and declined to describe Blank's 
specific injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson's film credits include "A Few Good Men," "Hoffa," "Terms of 
Endearment" and "The Shining."

2 SIDES NEAR COMPROMISE ON CITYWALK RED LINE LINK; TRANSPORTATION: A 
$20-MILLION SYSTEM WOULD SHUTTLE METRO RAIL RIDERS TO UNIVERSAL STUDIOS UNDER 
THE AGREEMENT THAT OFFICIALS HOPE TO FINALIZE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Already behind schedule on a new stop in Universal City, county transportation 
planners are working feverishly with entertainment giant MCA on a compromise 
that would connect Metro Rail trains to the Universal Studios entertainment 
complex through a $20-million people-mover system. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides hope an agreement can be put before the county Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority board today that would end months of deadlock over a 
new station site on Lankershim Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA has lobbied hard to relocate the Red Line stop closer to its CityWalk 
attraction, but county planners say such a move would be too costly and 
time-consuming. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a compromise solution being brokered by city officials, the planned 
station would still be built on Lankershim but would empty onto the east as 
well as the west to accommodate passengers bound for Universal Studios. Those 
riders would take a new shuttle service uphill to the entertainment center. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA executives and county transportation analysts have embraced the compromise 
but were scrambling to hammer out a final agreement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's dotting the i's and crossing the t's," MCA spokeswoman Christine Hanson 
said. "We're still working out some of the details." 
</P>
<P>
 Transit authority analyst Judith Wilson said she was hopeful that the 
compromise could be presented to the authority's board of directors today. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are anxious to minimize delays in construction at the stop, 
scheduled to have begun this month but held up by the debate with MCA. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives on both sides Tuesday declined to specify what issues remained 
to be resolved in reaching a final agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 But they said certain key points have been resolved, including MCA's 
commitment to pay for the people-mover system, which could cost as much as $20 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The county would pick up the tab for the eastern station entrances and various 
roadway projects to ease traffic in the area and improve access to the 
Hollywood Freeway and the Universal Studios lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise plan is backed by Mayor Richard Riordan, whose senior policy 
adviser, Ted Stein, has been instrumental in mediating the disagreement between 
MCA and the transportation authority. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Riordan returned $2,759 in campaign contributions to MCA and its 
representatives so that he could vote on the issue as a transit authority board 
member. State law bars officials from participating in any decision involving 
firms or people who have contributed more than $250 within the last 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't want a conflict of interest on one of the major transportation 
decisions before the MTA," said Riordan spokesman David Novak. 
</P>
<P>
 Novak said Riordan returned $1,751 to MCA lobbyist George Mihlsten, $751 to 
MCA itself and $257 to other individuals with ties to the multimedia concern. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, another transportation board member, said 
he, too, supports the new proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people-mover connecting . . . the east side of Lankershim to the theme 
park will increase ridership," he said. "This is a win-win for the community, 
MCA and San Fernando Valley residents anxious to have transit brought to them 
this century." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Nick Patsaouras, Antonovich's alternate on the board of directors, 
disagreed, saying the board has vetoed similar concessions to private companies 
in the past. "It's the issue of fairness," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A final agreement would cap months of talks between MCA and the county over 
whether to stick to the Lankershim site or move the station half a mile 
southeast, onto MCA property beneath the Hollywood Freeway near Cahuenga 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides agreed that ridership would be higher with the MCA site, but county 
analysts believed the shift would incur a 21-month delay and $41 million in 
cost overruns. 
</P>
<P>
 Although MCA disputes those figures, MCA has acknowledged the need for extra 
funding and dispatched representatives earlier this month to Washington in 
hopes of drumming up federal dollars for the move. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides hailed the compromise drafted by the city, because it satisfied two 
key demands in better serving the Universal Studios center and preventing cost 
overruns and delays.

EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; SHAKY RETURN TO SCHOOL; EDUCATION: 
DISORIENTED KENNEDY HIGH STUDENTS RECEIVE MAPS TO BUNGALOWS FIVE WEEKS AFTER 
QUAKE DAMAGED THEIR CAMPUS. THEY LEARN TO ADAPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Five weeks after the Northridge quake crippled their school, students returned 
to John F. Kennedy High School on Tuesday, confused and disoriented by a 
patchwork of 60 new bungalows and parts of old buildings, but eager to settle 
in to familiar routines. 
</P>
<P>
 Students quickly adapted to their new surroundings despite the fact that 
Tuesday was no ordinary first day of school. 
</P>
<P>
 The first students dribbled in an hour before school began, some to get maps 
and tour the new campus, others to greet friends they had not seen since before 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 School administrators and staff met hundreds of students who arrived by bus, 
handing out photocopied maps of the campus as a chilly wind whipped among the 
maze of buildings. Students clustered in small groups to decipher the maps, 
turning them one way, glancing up to compare them to the rows of bungalows, 
then looking down again. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school's all messed up," said 16-year-old Aaron Robinson. "It's gonna be 
confusing." 
</P>
<P>
 Many teachers were equally as lost. Sandy Wilcher's students milled outside 
her locked bungalow as she made her way about the campus trying to find them. 
"I was wandering all over the place, trying to find out where to go," Wilcher 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday, teachers were given "care packages" from the school district 
containing basic materials like pens, papers, notebooks and pencils. But that 
was little comfort to the photography teacher with no darkroom, the science 
teacher with no lab, the gym teacher with no locker rooms or the blind English 
teacher with no Braille lesson plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're winging it," said earth science teacher Lori Mount. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy Assistant Principal Pete Fries said attendance was at about 76% -- 
down to 1,705, from an estimated spring enrollment of 2,200. 
</P>
<P>
 While most made it to their classes with only minor delays, some ninth-graders 
were distressed by the drastic changes. "I was barely getting used to it," said 
Jackie Ochoa, 14, of Los Angeles. "It feels scary now, like coming to a new 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's administration building, with all of the school's offices and two 
floors of classrooms, was condemned following the quake. A replacement or 
significantly reconstructed building is not likely to be ready for two years, 
said Doug Brown, the district's director of facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills, which opens today, and Kennedy 
were the last two schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District to open 
after the January temblor caused major damage to the campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 On opening day at Kennedy, unforeseen problems created a slew of minor 
annoyances. 
</P>
<P>
 A sign on classroom NP 02, incorrectly designating it as the interim main 
office, was not removed until after several bewildered parents and students 
clustered outside the building, looking for school personnel.  
</P>
<P>
 Doubled-up homerooms left some students sitting on the floor and teachers 
struggling to be heard. Bike racks went out with the administration building, 
leaving some students to ride around the campus and lock up wherever they could 
find metal bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Bells to signal class changes were unpredictable, which made ending class all 
the more hectic because many bungalows were not equipped with clocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockers were another matter. There weren't any. 
</P>
<P>
 School personnel hope to retrieve the contents of lockers in the two 
less-damaged buildings within the next few weeks. Students with lockers in the 
administration building may not get them at all. For now, there are more 
backpacks on campus, stuffed with lunches and recovered schoolbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Photography teacher John Ker said he will have to teach his classes without a 
darkroom, chemicals or a sink. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 28 years, you just take it in stride," said Ker, who said he will 
either bring in some electronic imaging equipment of his own or teach out of a 
book. "It's a test for all of us -- teachers, students, the district, maybe 
even the community at large." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As complicated as the first day back to school was for most people, it was 
especially difficult for English teacher Tari Livingston-Hughes. Completely 
blind, Livingston-Hughes has been teaching in the same classroom in the 
administration building for the past 11 years. Her Braille books and materials 
are inaccessible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot to learn," she said. "I have to figure out new ways of locating 
where I am -- I only know the way in relation to the administration building, 
which is no longer available to me." 
</P>
<P>
 To make up for time lost to the quake recovery, school officials trimmed 23 
minutes from breaks throughout the day, increasing instruction time at the 
school. Spring break was canceled to allow students to finish school on 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all the same once you're in class," said 15-year-old Cathy Barriga. "The 
teachers, the teaching -- everything is the same. It gives you confidence that 
everything is going to be OK eventually."

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: MEETING ON COYOTE ISSUE RESCHEDULED 
</P>

<P>
 A canceled meeting of the Los Angeles Department of Animal Regulation to 
discuss the city's ban on coyote trapping has been rescheduled for March 23, 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting of the department's board of commissioners will substitute for a 
Jan. 23 meeting that was canceled because the gathering site was damaged during 
the Jan. 17 Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The rescheduled meeting will be held at 7 p.m. at Parkman Middle School, 20800 
Burbank Blvd., Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioners will listen to public comments before deciding whether to 
continue the eight-month ban on coyote trapping. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Animal Regulation Commission voted in June to ban coyote trapping by 
city employees, residents in the West Valley have reported an increase in 
coyote sightings, particularly in hillside neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The increased sightings, according to animal regulation officers, are due in 
part to the end of trapping, the abundance of small rodents and other food for 
coyotes, and last year's brush fires that drove some coyotes into residential 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents have protested the ban, saying it leaves pets and small 
children vulnerable to coyote attacks. HUGO MARTIN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: ARTIST PLANS TO PLACE 'ANGELS' ACROSS L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The mystery of the red angels has been solved.  
</P>
<P>
 A 29-year-old Los Angeles artist is the one running around the city placing 
six-inch plaster angels in various spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Jill D'Agnenica said she will continue placing angels -- 4,687 of them -- 
across the city. She is doing it, she says, because "the experience of seeing 
an angel will remind people that they are lucky to be living in the City of 
Angels." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, she placed about 300 of the red plaster angels on Ventura 
Boulevard. Six of the angels were found on the lawn of St. James Presbyterian 
Church.  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know where they came from," said Joanne Dodds, an administrator at 
the Tarzana church, who first thought the angels were crumpled pieces of paper. 
"But maybe they will protect us. . . . We could use a little protection." 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone reacts the same. Angels found on the steps of the Chateau 
business offices in Woodland Hills were thrown away early Monday because office 
workers thought they were a prank. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no idea who put them there," said Elaine Guzik, a bookkeeper at the 
Chateau. "They were cute. But we had no clue why they were there. Many times we 
get people who do strange things around here, so we threw them out." 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured different things would happen to the angels," said D'Agnenica, who 
encourages people to take them home. "Some people see them as symbols of hope, 
but other people are annoyed with them or angry because they are in their 
space." 
</P>
<P>
 After the first anniversary of the Los Angeles riots, D'Agnenica decided the 
City of Angels needed some cheering up. She started passing out her angels in 
small communities like Watts and Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had lots of bad press in L.A. at that time," D'Agnenica said. "I thought 
they could be a catalyst for reflection." 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving a $4,550 grant from the Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibition in 
October, she was able to stop spending her own money -- her credit card was 
already up to $1,500. She and her assistant, Diana Sieradski, have made about 
1,500 angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so expensive, but it made so much sense to me," she said. "It seemed 
so right, and I knew I would get the money somehow." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I heard about the project, I thought it was a great public art piece," 
said Paul Martinez, an independent documentary maker who follows D'Agnenica on 
her runs. "But it is not just art, it is a goodwill thing. Between the riots, 
floods and earthquakes, anything good that anyone can do is worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 "People act funny when they see them," he said. "They are not used to getting 
something for free and they are not sure if they are stealing or something." 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 17, D'Agnenica planned to place 70 angels on Martin Luther King Jr. 
Boulevard for the parade that day. After the earthquake rocked her downtown Los 
Angeles home that morning, D'Agnenica ran downstairs to her adjacent studio to 
find all the angels in perfect condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we saw that not a single angel was broken, we knew we had to pass them 
out," she said. She and her assistants placed the angels around the Simi Valley 
Freeway, beside the gaping hole in the middle of Balboa Boulevard and in front 
of the Northridge Meadows Apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stopped a squad car and asked if we could put them by the apartments," 
D'Agnenica said. "The police officer rolled his eyes and said, 'Get in.' Then 
this burly National Guardsman helped me load them into the trunk." JEANNETTE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; RESIDENTS GRAPPLING WITH QUAKE DEBRIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sylmar homeowners attempting to put the earthquake behind them are finding 
their efforts reach only so far -- the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 Some streets in the northeastern Valley community, famous for its brush with 
seismic disaster in 1971, have been lined with piles of debris for up to two 
weeks, said Frank Jacobs, executive director of the Sylmar Chamber of Commerce. 
Much of the waste consists of household items destroyed by the Jan. 17 temblor, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came about two weeks ago and picked up some trash, but the streets are 
filling up again," Jacobs said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who have called the Los Angeles city Bureau of Sanitation telephone 
numbers have gotten little more than busy signals or no answer at all, he said. 
So they have flooded the Chamber of Commerce with calls instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has two telephone numbers for two kinds of trash. For bulky items 
such as furniture, residents should call the Bureau of Sanitation community 
service line, (800) 773-2489. For heavy construction material, such as blocks, 
residents must call the Engineering Bureau at (213) 847-8811, said Michael 
Miller, assistant director of the Bureau of Sanitation. Both bureaus are part 
of the city Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs said he has tried, and failed. "The phones just keep ringing and 
ringing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An attempt by The Times to reach the Sanitation Bureau on Tuesday afternoon 
produced about a five-minute wait. But periodic attempts to reach the 
Engineering Bureau -- over several hours -- were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said residents should expect to wait about a week between when they 
call and when their bulky items are picked up. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff at the Sylmar office of Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon have 
received several telephone calls about the rubbish piling up, and have been 
told by city officials that bulk pickups should take 5 to 10 days, said Sybil 
MacDonald, communication director for Alarcon. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're finding out is it's more like two weeks," MacDonald said. "There's 
just a tremendous back load. There's really nothing that can be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, residents who can cart the trash themselves have been taking 
advantage of a free dumpster provided by Browning-Ferris Industries near 
Alarcon's field office, at Gladstone and Hubbard streets, said Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents have tried to break up their debris and fit it into the city's 
trash containers, he said. As in most Los Angeles communities, Sylmar residents 
are allocated one large black barrel for household trash and other containers 
for clippings and recyclable materials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be here for six months filling up our black containers," said Jacobs. 
"People have 10 times the amount of trash as allowed by the city's trash 
containers." GEOFFREY MOHAN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; MEETING TO FOCUS ON TRAFFIC, SAFETY ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents concerned about freeway traffic on local streets will have a chance 
to question public officials at a community meeting scheduled in Sylmar 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon called the meeting to discuss 
traffic and public safety issues arising from the earthquake, as well as 
general problems in the community, said Sybil MacDonald, director of 
communication for Alarcon.Officials from the state Department of 
Transportation, Metrolink and the Los Angeles Police Department will be 
available during the meeting, scheduled for 7 to 8:30 p.m. in the auditorium of 
El Dorado Avenue Elementary School, 12749 El Dorado Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sylmar has been impacted a lot from that rerouting and is starting to 
experience a lot of wear and tear," said MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst impacts have been in the northern part of the community, where 
Golden State Freeway traffic trying to negotiate the Newhall Pass or head east 
on the Foothill Freeway has been detoured through local streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the problems is the rerouting has been done in such a way as you have 
to drive a long distance to get back on" the Golden State Freeway, said 
MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents also have expressed safety and traffic concerns after the opening of 
the Sylmar/San Fernando station of the Metrolink rail line, said MacDonald.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: QUAKE-AID SERVICE FOR DISABLED BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People with disabilities who need emergency food stamps because of the 
Northridge earthquake can avoid the hassle of long lines or inaccessible food 
stamp disbursement centers by bringing their vouchers to a new service that 
began Tuesday in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Provided by the nonprofit Independent Living Center of Southern California, 
the free service is intended to lessen the burden of getting emergency food 
stamps for people with a disability on Supplemental Security Income. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have to stand in line; they don't have to go into an inaccessible 
place; they don't have to worry about their health problems," center Director 
Norma Vescovo said of the new service. 
</P>
<P>
 After the earthquake, the county Department of Social Services sent out more 
than 600,000 letters of authorization for emergency food stamp assistance, 
Vescovo said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vescovo's agency started hearing complaints from people with disabilities 
when they tried to exchange these letters for food stamps at the three 
disbursement centers in the San Fernando Valley. The Reseda location had no 
handicapped parking, the North Hollywood center was inaccessible to a person in 
a wheelchair, and many people felt unsafe at the Pacoima disbursement center, 
Vescovo said. 
</P>
<P>
 All three centers had long lines that presented a hardship for a person with a 
disability, Vescovo said. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case at the Reseda disbursement center, a 64-year-old woman with a 
nerve disease and diabetes finally gave up when she was told that it would be 
another five-hour wait. She had already been standing in line 2 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the most miserable 2 1/2 hours I have ever spent," said Trudy, who 
would not give her last name. "There was absolutely no place to sit." 
</P>
<P>
 Vescovo said people such as Trudy can now bring their letters of authorization 
into the Independent Living Center and pick up their food stamps the next day. 
The center's workers will exchange the letters for food stamps at the 
disbursement centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Independent Living Center of Southern California is at 14354 Haynes St. in 
Van Nuys. No reservations are required for the food stamp exchange service. The 
center's hours are 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. JEFF SCHNAUFER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: NEW ZONING STUDIED FOR HOME BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prompted by the traffic problems after the Northridge quake, a Los Angeles 
City Council panel instructed city planners Tuesday to study ways to revise 
zoning laws that prohibit businesses operating out of homes. 
</P>
<P>
 To help city officials draft regulations to permit home-based businesses, the 
council's Planning and Land Use Committee asked city planners to draft a report 
on how other cities in the region permit and regulate such businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 An effort to develop regulations for home-based businesses has been bogged 
down since 1985 amid debate by planning officials over what types of business 
to allow in residential areas and how to regulate those businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Laura Chick -- a member of the committee -- said she feels 
strongly about legalizing home-based businesses because the city is "losing 
untold amounts of revenue" from fees that could be charged to such businesses. 
She said many such business now operate illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the traffic problems after the quake signaled the need for flexible 
zoning laws that permit some business to operate from residential areas without 
disrupting the character of the neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council also backed a motion by Chick on Tuesday to support state 
legislation that would require cities in Los Angeles County to adopt zoning 
laws that permit home-based businesses. HUGO MARTIN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; FEW GATHER FOR DEMOLITION OF BULLOCK'S STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Without fanfare or marked ceremony, just a few sightseers gathered behind a 
guarded chain-link fence Tuesday to watch the demolition of one of the icons of 
the Northridge earthquake: the Bullock's department store building at the 
Northridge Fashion Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The building, completed in 1971 before stiff building codes were in place, was 
among the most photographed images of the devastation caused by the Jan. 17 
quake. The quake tore away the facade of the store, leaving onlookers to gape 
at the structural collapse of the department store and wonder what might have 
happened had the store been filled with shoppers at the time the quake struck. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers on Monday began the long task of tearing down and hauling away the 
rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Fenning, executive vice president of Cleveland Wrecking Co., said it 
will take about a month to finish the job. A crew of about 10 started by 
knocking down the highest, most precarious remains of the building with a 
wrecking ball Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 The wrecking ball may make a reappearance today, Fenning said. But most of the 
work over the next few weeks will consist of workers sorting the debris with 
hydraulic equipment so it can be hauled away and dumped. 
</P>
<P>
 Fenning, whose firm is also handling demolition of a nearby parking garage, 
said no dynamite will be used in the removal. 
</P>
<P>
 Merle Goldstone, spokeswoman for Bullock's, said the department store company 
intends to rebuild the store at Northridge Fashion Center and is negotiating 
with developers. Goldstone would not give an estimate of the cost of 
reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 The demolition provided needed diversion for Naomi Casasanta of Indiana and 
Annetta Koetje of Michigan, two volunteers from the nearby Red Cross emergency 
center who took advantage of their first day off in 12 days to come watch the 
wrecking process. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers were in high spirits as they raced to snap photos of the heavy 
equipment before a guard slowly swung the gates shut in their faces. The 
pictures would be shown to friends back home, they said before heading off to 
check out the damage at Cal State Northridge. JILL LEOVY

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; NEW TAX PROGRAM TO HELP FUND LIBRARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like many librarians struggling with a tight budget, Holly Ziman, the school 
library coordinator for Burbank, could use an extra few thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 She's hoping California taxpayers will provide that extra boost through a new 
program that allows wage-earners to set aside a portion of their tax bills for 
libraries at public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could do quite nicely with $8,000 to $10,000 in each library," said Ziman, 
who was hired in December by the city to help the school district library 
system, which has been adrift for three years. "But I think $5,000 to $6,000 
would really do a nice job." 
</P>
<P>
 Ziman works for the city, but her job is to oversee the libraries at the 
Burbank Unified School District's high schools and middle schools. The Burbank 
City Council created her position to help the school district, which three 
years ago had to lay off its librarians because of budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three years before she took over, Ziman said, the libraries were run by 
clerks and their book collections suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things tend to have drifted," said Ziman, who found that the district's 
collection of science materials had suffered the most because they had not been 
updated. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a lot of new technology and we felt we were being passed by the 
wayside," Ziman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the horizon is a glimmer of hope that Burbank public school students 
will get both the technology and access to current materials they need. This 
year's state tax forms will include a box allowing taxpayers to indicate that 
they want to make a donation to public libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 In previous years, taxpayers have had the choice to make donations to preserve 
endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 Many advocates of public libraries say they regard support for book 
collections and library services as endangered. 
</P>
<P>
 "(In California) we are ranked last in terms of support for school libraries," 
Ziman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax form checkoff does not allow the taxpayer to indicate where the funds 
should go, but local libraries would apply for extra funding based on how much 
revenue the state receives. 
</P>
<P>
 With extra funding, Ziman would hope to increase the numbers of books and 
magazines for Burbank High and John Burroughs High School students, and give 
them access to new computer technologies that will help them later in life. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping that by making that available to them, when they come into a 
public library and later go on to a university, they will be better prepared to 
use the library system," Ziman said. ED BOND

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WESTLAKE VILLAGE; HOME BUYERS FLOCK TO AREA AFTER QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 You don't have to look as far as Ventura County to find a post-earthquake 
economic boom. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate agents in Westlake Village say that since the earthquake, it's 
hard to keep up with the demand for housing in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our little Conejo Valley is being inundated," said Stephanie Bell Eagle of 
Birchwood Realty/Better Homes & Gardens in Westlake Village, which lies on the 
western border of Los Angeles County. "We don't have enough inventory to go 
around, all the hotels are booked, and it's just madness." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 quake, home hunters have flocked to far-flung areas like 
Thousand Oaks seeking to escape the earthquake-scarred San Fernando Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 Westlake Village is closer to the quake zone, but it sustained little damage 
in the quake and is now getting a piece of Ventura County's good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate agents and apartment managers say the town has become the refuge 
of choice for many people who want to escape the quake zone without really 
leaving the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Surratt, manager of The Knolls, an upscale apartment building, said that 
the first week after the quake an unprecedented 170 prospective tenants visited 
the apartment offices seeking housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The apartment building is full, and there is a long waiting list, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is full out here," she said. Some of the new tenants are employees 
with insurance firms temporarily relocated to the area to handle insurance 
claims. Others are moving from damaged homes in the Valley, and a considerable 
number are simply moving because they are afraid to stay near the fault, 
Surratt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are just feeling uncomfortable and, especially if they are renting, they 
just want to live some place where they feel better," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rentals are so tight in town that prospective tenants have been known to make 
appointments to view a home, only to find that it was rented during the time it 
took them to drive over, said Bell Eagle. 
</P>
<P>
 The housing market is not alone in receiving a boost from the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake Village City Councilman Doug Yarrow said several businesses have 
relocated employees to offices in town since the quake, including large 
insurance companies and Packard Bell, which moved part of its operations into 
the area after its Chatsworth offices were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Levett, president of the Westlake Village Chamber of Commerce, said the 
chamber's phone lines have been ringing off the hook since the quake. She 
expects that much of the new demand for office and residential space will be 
temporary. But nonetheless, "we are hoping some have come to stay," she said.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; CHILD PORNOGRAPHY SUSPECT ARRAIGNED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Burbank man accused of operating a mail-order pornography business that 
involved children who appeared to be as young as 3 was arraigned Tuesday in Los 
Angeles Superior Court, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adin Garner, 65, pleaded not guilty to 10 counts of exhibiting a minor in 
pornography and distributing and advertising obscene materials, Deputy Dist. 
Atty.Gregory J. Denton said. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted of the charges, Garner, who remains in custody pending $100,000 
bail, faces a maximum sentence of eight years in prison, Denton said. A 
pretrial hearing has been set for March 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police arrested Garner at his Burbank home in December after using 
an alias and a post office box to place orders for child pornography 
videotapes.

 Police believed that Garner was distributing videotapes nationally and that he 
made some tapes by quickly flipping pages in front of a camera of pornography 
magazines that featured children. The bulk of the tapes sold for $75 to $200, 
earning Garner at least $1,000 a week, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garner, who used the alias Mel Lennon, had been involved in the pornography 
distribution business since the 1960s and had previously been convicted for 
those activities, authorities said. JULIE TAMAKI

LOCKHEED'S SUPPLIERS ARE BLAMED IN TOXIC EXPOSURE CASE; COURT: AN ATTORNEY IN 
THE RETRIAL SAYS CHEMICAL FIRMS SHOWED 'A CARELESS DISREGARD' OF WORKERS' 
RIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A lawyer for Lockheed workers claiming health damage from toxic exposures 
Tuesday blamed the defense giant's chemical suppliers, telling a Los Angeles 
jury that the suppliers failed to provide adequate warnings of the danger of 
their products. 
</P>
<P>
 In his opening statement in the Superior Court retrial of the marathon toxic 
exposures case, attorney Thomas V. Girardi said the chemical firms showed "a 
careless disregard of the rights" of the workers, who helped manufacture 
military aircraft at Lockheed's Burbank complex from the 1960s through the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the chemical suppliers) put chemicals out there that cause cancer, and 
they knew it," Girardi said. "They put chemicals out there that cause central 
nervous system damage, and they knew it." 
</P>
<P>
 The question for jurors is: "Did they give proper notice of these kinds of 
problems, or did they not?" Girardi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 624 current and former Lockheed workers are seeking unspecified damages 
from two dozen chemical companies that supplied the solvents, resins and 
adhesives used to build the Stealth bomber and other planes.  
</P>
<P>
 In a trial expected to last at least several weeks, the workers are claiming 
they suffered injuries ranging from skin irritation to cancer because the 
chemical firms concealed the dangers of their products. 
</P>
<P>
 The chemical firms -- including such giants as Exxon, DuPont, Arco and Unocal 
-- say they provided adequate health warnings to Lockheed, which was 
responsible for the safety of its employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The first trial lasted eight months and ended last spring in a mistrial 
following the longest jury deliberations in a civil case in U. S. history. 
After 12 weeks of often bitter debate, jurors managed to reach only a few minor 
verdicts, and were deadlocked on the central questions: Were the workers 
actually injured by chemical exposure, and were inadequate warnings the cause? 
</P>
<P>
 The current trial, like the first, involves the health claims of 14 "pilot" 
plaintiffs only. Attorneys on both sides hope the outcome will trigger 
settlements or dismissals of many other claims, though more trials are 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to simplify the retrial, Judge Richard C. Hubbell has divided it 
into two parts. In the phase that began Tuesday, jurors are to decide which 
firms supplied chemicals to Lockheed, and whether the warnings they furnished 
were adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second phase, jurors will decide if the 14 pilot workers were injured 
in the way that they claimed, and if inadequate warnings were the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed was an original defendant, but agreed to a $33-million settlement 
before the first trial started in August, 1992. That fact has not been 
disclosed to jurors to avoid influencing their verdict on the liability of the 
chemical firms. 
</P>
<P>
 In his opening statement, Girardi tried to show that the companies 
soft-pedaled health risks in the warning labels, or material safety data 
sheets, they furnished with their products -- and began giving complete 
information only after workers were exposed for years. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, he read from an American Cyanamid warning label in 1979 that 
said its corrosion inhibiting primer "may cause irritation of eyes, nose and 
throat." The label in 1985 for the same product revealed that it "has been 
shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals," Girardi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, the chemical firms "warned of eye irritation and other things that 
don't make a big difference to a worker out there trying to earn a living," 
Girardi said. The more severe warnings "they didn't give until much later." 
</P>
<P>
 But defense lawyers, who began their opening statements Tuesday, claimed the 
product warnings were updated as scientific knowledge increased. In any event, 
they said, the information was not intended for individual workers but for 
Lockheed -- which was responsible for providing a safe workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 They said Lockheed often blended common solvents to make its own secret 
formulations, reducing their responsibility further.

CONSERVANCY TO BUY LAND AT HEART OF HENLEY DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The former owners of two lots in Sherman Oaks have dropped a lawsuit accusing 
rock musician Don Henley and city and state officials of conspiring to block 
development near Henley's Bel-Air home, after the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy agreed to buy the plaintiff's property. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit filed in April by Richard Jean and Adam Siegler asserted that 
conservancy officials fraudulently raised environmental concerns about 
developing the lots to curry the favor of Henley, a frequent contributor to 
environmental causes and former member of the Eagles rock band. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sieglers dropped the lawsuit in December after accepting the conservancy's 
offer of $500,000 for about six acres on the 14100 block of Mulholland Drive, 
just west of the Henley property. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was absolutely no wrongdoing on the conservancy's part," said Liz 
Cheadle, attorney for the conservancy. "This property has been on our 
acquisition list for a long time. It's a very significant habitat linkage for 
many kinds of wildlife." 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Siegler, an attorney who represented the family, declined comment 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement agreement signed by the plaintiffs and defendants "operates as 
a complete (retraction) of all allegations . . . that the defendants . . . 
engaged in a conspiracy to prevent the Sieglers from developing the land or to 
pressure the Sieglers into selling the land at a price below market value." 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants, including conservancy Executive Director Joseph T. Edmiston 
and Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, contended that the Sieglers 
filed the lawsuit in an attempt to extract more money from the state agency for 
the purchase of the land. 
</P>
<P>
 The $500,000 was based on the conservancy's appraisal of the parcels. The 
Sieglers at one point had sought about $1 million for the land, Cheadle said.

CALABASAS TO GET $4.5 MILLION IN PROPERTY TAX WINDFALL; FINANCES: CITY IS 
EXPECTED TO RECEIVE MONEY FROM COUNTY OVER 11 YEARS. CLAIM WAS FILED LAST YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Calabasas is expected to receive a previously unanticipated $4.5 
million in property tax revenues from Los Angeles County over the next 11 years 
because of an agreement over how to calculate the tax share owed to new cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement comes after Calabasas officials filed a claim against the county 
in May, asserting that recent state legislation entitled newly incorporated 
cities to a greater share of property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The formulas for calculating the shares are very complex," said City Manager 
Charles Cate. "But it basically means more money that could be used toward the 
redevelopment of Old Town, park improvements, a regional library . . . or 
simply for putting into reserves for future bad times." 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas, which incorporated in 1991, has an operating budget of about $5.7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 At its regular meeting last Wednesday, the City Council unanimously approved 
the deal. The first installment of about $300,000 from the county is expected 
this fiscal year, Cate said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting, the City Council also denied an application for a carwash on 
the corner of Calabasas Road and Parkway Calabasas because of concerns that the 
project would cause traffic snarls and the destruction of two giant oak trees 
and several smaller ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted unanimously against the project, agreeing with a Planning 
Commission opinion that expanding the Unocal 76 station to include a carwash 
was inappropriate for the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "The traffic flow that would be created by this project just would not work 
there," Mayor Marvin Lopata said. "I know that the city could use a carwash, 
but I don't think it would be a safe situation at this location."

ROBBINS REACHES AGREEMENT WITH STATE ETHICS PANEL; FINES: FAIR POLITICAL 
PRACTICES COMMISSION SAYS THE FORMER LAWMAKER WILL PAY $15,000 FOR CONCEALING 
MONEY FROM AN EXTORTION SCHEME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former state Sen. Alan Robbins, now serving the remainder of a federal prison 
term in a Hollywood halfway house, has reached an agreement with a state ethics 
watchdog panel to pay $15,000 in fines for failing to accurately report his 
income. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the state Fair Political Practices Commission said Robbins will 
pay maximum penalties for concealing money he gleaned from an extortion scheme 
that landed the former Van Nuys Democratic lawmaker in prison in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the FPPC plans to fine former California Coastal 
Commissioner Mark Nathanson $10,000 for not disclosing hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in bribes he took from landowners seeking permit approvals. 
</P>
<P>
 An FPPC spokeswoman said the panel will meet March 3 to decide whether to give 
final approval to the fines. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the eight FPPC counts against Robbins result from his guilty plea in 
1991 that he used his office to extort bribe money from victims in exchange for 
official Senate action. 
</P>
<P>
 In those 1988 cases, San Diego businessman Jack Naiman paid Robbins $20,000 
and former Capitol lobbyist Clayton Jackson funneled $32,800 to Robbins through 
former state Sen. Paul Carpenter (D-Downey) and public relations executive 
Jennifer Goddard. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying in a federal trial last year, both Robbins and Goddard played key 
roles in convicting Jackson and Carpenter on charges of political corruption. 
Jackson was sentenced to 6 1/2 years in prison, while Carpenter has fled the 
country to avoid a prison term. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining five counts against Robbins stem from his failure to disclose 
income he received from loan repayments or from the sale of property. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All of the counts allege that Robbins failed to report his income in 1988 and 
1989 as required by the Political Reform Act, which is meant to guarantee full 
financial disclosure by politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $16,000 maximum fine that Robbins faced -- $2,000 per count -- he 
stipulated that he will agree to pay only $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathanson, who is serving a sentence in federal prison for extorting bribes 
from individuals seeking Coastal Commission permits, did not contest the FPPC's 
accusations and agreed to pay the maximum $10,000 penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The five counts he faces include soliciting and taking $208,000 in bribes in 
1987 and 1990 in exchange for approving construction of a swimming pool and 
home renovations in the highly restricted coastal zone.

MAN FACES TRIAL IN DEATH OF NORTHRIDGE TEEN-AGER; CRIME: EVANS YORK, 19, IS 
ACCUSED OF KILLING THE 16-YEAR-OLD DURING A 1993 ROBBERY. THE VICTIM'S BODY WAS 
NEVER FOUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Porter Ranch man was ordered Tuesday to stand trial for murder in the 1993 
killing of a Northridge teen-ager whose body was never found, according to Los 
Angeles County prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Judith Ashmann set March 22 as the trial date for Evans 
York, 19, who is accused of killing Michael Azzaro, 16, during a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Although York is charged with a special-circumstance allegation that could 
trigger the death penalty on conviction, Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. 
John Asari said his office ultimately decided not to seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Asari refused to elaborate on the decision, other than to say the defendant's 
age and background were taken into consideration. If convicted, the defendant 
could still face life in prison without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Azzaro and York were seen together in Azzaro's car in the Van Nuys area Feb. 
13, 1993, Asari said. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members reported Azzaro missing the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 The following day, Feb. 15, York went to police and told them that he and 
Azzaro had been kidnaped and only he managed to escape. On the same day, 
Azzaro's car was found on Imperial Highway in the Lennox area. 
</P>
<P>
 Asari said the district attorney's office decided to file charges against York 
after reviewing evidence provided by the Los Angeles Police Department's 
Devonshire Division, including self-incriminating statements York made to 
authorities.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 2 NEW MEMBERS ARE APPOINTED TO ANTELOPE VALLEY 
FAIR BOARD; AGENCIES: GOV. WILSON SELECTS NEWCOMERS STEVE LANDAKER AND BETTY 
SMITH AND REAPPOINTS CHARLA ABBOTT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two newcomers were named to the board of the Antelope Valley Fair and one 
board member was reappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson announced the appointments last week of Steve Landaker, a 
former trustee of the Antelope Valley Union High School District, and Betty 
Smith, customer service manager for a Palmdale trash company. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Charla Abbott, a real estate agent chosen in 1990 to serve on 
the fair board, was reappointed by Wilson to a second four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Landaker and Smith replace John Blalock and Gary Cosgrove, both of whom were 
named in 1990 to the board of the 50th District Agricultural Assn. as it is 
formally known. Blalock sought reappointment while Cosgrove did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is to be sworn in at the fair board's meeting Thursday.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PLAN LETS SOME STUDENTS AVOID TRANSFERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Students facing transfers away from their neighborhood school because of new 
attendance boundaries beginning in 1995 may instead go to their old campus 
under a revised plan by the William S. Hart Union High School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Authors of the proposed boundaries say allowing those students to choose 
campuses will temporarily address complaints by some Saugus parents about their 
children attending school in Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
 District trustees will have their first review of the proposed boundaries at 
their regular meeting tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents objected to the first draft of new attendance areas that called 
for shifting 220 to 250 students living in upper Bouquet Canyon from Arroyo 
Seco Junior High School to Sierra Vista Junior High School, beginning in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 District organizers adjusted the plan, giving students the right to choose if 
they would rather attend their old school. Crowding at Arroyo Seco will be 
relieved by shifting those living in Valencia's Northbridge neighborhood from 
the school to the new La Mesa Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
 Under recently enacted state law, a student may apply to attend any school 
within his or her district. The district option gives qualifying students -- 
those who live near one campus but are slated to attend another under the 
boundary shift -- higher priority in deciding which campus to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials concede that the move is a temporary solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Children living in residences near Bouquet Canyon and Plum Canyon roads that 
are purchased after April 1 will be designated to go to Sierra Vista Junior 
High and Canyon High School. Those students will be shifted to the new schools 
in 1995, when Plum Canyon Road is extended to Whites Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't take care of all of them, forever," said Lew White, district 
facilities director. "It will take care of all of them for now." 
</P>
<P>
 Both new schools will open with lower grade levels this fall -- seventh grade 
at La Mesa and ninth and 10th grade at Valencia -- and will add the higher 
grades in subsequent years. District officials believe that few juniors and 
seniors will want to transfer away from their friends and into a new school.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MOBILE HOME OWNERS OFFERED AID; QUAKE: FEMA 
WILL HELP RESTORE UP TO 800 RESIDENCES KNOCKED OFF THEIR FOUNDATIONS. BUT FIRST 
THE AGENCY MUST FIND OWNERS' WHEREABOUTS.

 City officials are having difficulty finding hundreds of mobile home residents 
displaced by last month's earthquake who are now eligible for free repairs to 
their damaged dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency will spend between $4 million and $6 
million to restore up to 800 mobile homes that were knocked off their 
foundations in Santa Clarita during the Northridge quake, city officials 
estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 But in order for the work to be done, residents must first approve it. The 
city says many of them have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows where all these people are?" said city spokeswoman Gail Foy. "But 
they're gone, and somehow we've got to find them." 
</P>
<P>
 Park managers and city officials say many residents are probably staying with 
relatives or in local motels but have failed to leave forwarding addresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides being raised and leveled, damaged homes will be better braced against 
wind and seismic shaking under the FEMA grant program. Residents who have 
already paid for such repairs or improvements may be eligible for federal 
reimbursements, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 10% of the 51,062 mobile homes in Los Angeles County were declared 
uninhabitable as a result of the quake, sparking renewed debate over whether 
costly additional safety measures should be required by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Clarita, an estimated 1,800 mobile homes were rocked off their 
foundations, planning officials said. Several hundred are still down and 
without gas and water. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Henry, manager of Cordova Estates mobile home park in Canyon Country, said 
gas was being restored to many homes in his park as late as Tuesday. The 
restoration of service will probably bring former residents back to their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "News travels fast," he said. "So I think things will start coming together a 
little better now." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they hope to have all the downed mobile homes restored by 
the end of March.

FEDERAL OIL LAWS FUEL FIGHT; STATE PRODUCERS LOBBY TO LIFT U.S. CRUDE EXPORT 
BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's independent oil and natural gas producers know how America could 
restore some balance to its trade with Japan -- if it weren't for a two-decade 
old federal law that they say is wrecking the market for their product. 
</P>
<P>
 The law -- a legacy of the 1970s oil crisis -- virtually bans the export of 
U.S. crude. And that gives Alaskan oil producers little choice but to send all 
their oil south -- most of it to California. 
</P>
<P>
 In an era of unrelentingly low crude oil prices, the oil -- which otherwise 
could be exported profitably to Japan -- depresses prices for California crude 
by $2.50 a barrel or more beyond the already depressed world market price, the 
independents say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anywhere from 300,000 to 500,000 excess barrels of oil end up in the 
California market each day," said Daniel P. Kramer, executive director of the 
California Independent Petroleum Assn., which represents most of the 
independent oil and gas producers in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the independents press a long wish list on state and federal policy 
makers, overturning the ban -- which comes up for review this year -- is at the 
top, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The independents made their case at a Sacramento event Tuesday, framed by an 
oil-drilling rig erected on the grounds of the state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 They argue that by suppressing oil prices, the flow of Alaskan crude makes it 
uneconomical to pump much of California's heavy crude oil out of the ground. 
Besides unleashing California production, exporting the Alaskan oil could cut 
$2.2 billion to $3.6 billion a year from the U.S. trade deficit with Japan, 
currently running at an annual $60 billion, the independents contend. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some high-ranking energy experts have called lifting the ban a 
"no-brainer." But it may not be easy to block its periodic renewal by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the opponents are the politically powerful Seafarers International 
Union, whose members transport the Alaskan crude down the West Coast. Any 
Alaskan oil transported to Japan most likely would travel in foreign flag 
tankers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maritime Trades Department of the AFL-CIO, which includes the Seafarers 
and 41 other unions with a total of 8 million members, passed a resolution 
Friday that it plans to distribute to members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three years have elapsed since the United States sent its sons and daughters 
off to war in the Persian Gulf. . . ." it reads. "Ironically, at this critical 
juncture in our nation's history, an effort is under way to remove current 
restrictions on the export of Alaskan oil." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Energy has launched a study of the idea and plans to 
hold public hearings next month in San Francisco and Anchorage before making a 
policy recommendation in April or May. The DOE will ponder how lifting the ban 
could affect crude prices and production, state and federal revenue, employment 
among both oil and maritime workers and tanker traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the analysis concludes that lifting the ban would benefit independent 
producers, domestic production and the state, I would be a strong advocate," 
Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond creating jobs, the unions say the ban has saved West Coast consumers 
"billions" of dollars, as lower oil prices translated into lower gasoline 
prices at the pump. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The independents point to a study they sponsored that predicts lifting the ban 
would raise crude prices both in California and Alaska, increasing domestic oil 
production by a net 400,000 to 500,000 barrels a day. That could create 5,500 
or more jobs in California alone, according to the study by Martin Carnoy, an 
education professor at Stanford University, and Lenny Goldberg, a 
Sacramento-based consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg further contends that consumers -- in California and elsewhere -- 
would not notice any rise in gasoline prices if the ban were lifted. "Prices at 
the gas pump fluctuate with world market prices, not regional crude oil 
prices," Goldberg said.  
</P>
<P>
 Less optimistic is gasoline marketing expert Trilby Lundberg. Using the 
independents' own numbers, all else being equal, she figures that ending the 
ban would raise pump prices as much as 6 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
 The major oil companies are mostly staying out of the fight for now. But the 
battered independents aren't likely to give up easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Hoffman, president of Taft-based Berry Petroleum Co., said the company, 
which averages about $60 million a year in gross sales, paid $6 million and $8 
million in federal and state taxes in 1990 and 1991, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year we'll be filing for a refund," Hoffman said, "and it's directly due 
to government rules interfering in our business. The government is killing the 
goose that lays the golden egg." The Cost to California Producers 
</P>
<P>
 California's independent oil producers say that Alaskan crude, forced into the 
state's market by a ban on U.S. oil exports, is depressing the price of their 
oil by an average of $2.50 a barrel or more. Chart compares the price of two 
grades of crude -- the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate and California's 
Elk Hills Stevens -- that are roughly comparable in the characteristics that 
affect cost. 
</P>
<P>
 1994 West Texas Intermediate: $14.24 Elk Hills Stevens: $11.70

CABLE RATES CUT AGAIN; CONSUMERS: THE 7% REDUCTION, THE FCC'S SECOND IN LESS 
THAN A YEAR, FOLLOWS COMPLAINTS THAT FIRST ROLLBACK WAS INEFFECTIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal regulators voted unanimously Tuesday to order a new round of cable 
television rate cuts, slashing another 7% after a previous round of cuts 
partially backfired. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's second attempt in less than a year to lower prices for the 
nation's 58 million cable subscribers comes after consumers and economists 
criticized the Federal Communications Commission over the effectiveness of the 
first rate cut, which unexpectedly produced increases in monthly fees for 
millions of subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rules, which impose an overall 17% rate reduction -- an additional 7% 
on top of last year's 10% cut -- could complicate ambitious plans announced by 
many cable companies, such as Tele-Communications Inc. and Time Warner Inc., to 
spend billions of dollars to replace their copper wires with higher-capacity 
fiber-optic cable. 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy M. Keegan, a vice president of the California Cable TV Assn., said the 
rollback could hamper the industry's ability to compete against emerging 
competitors such as regional telephone companies and even newer providers that 
plan to deliver cable programming to consumers via satellite, microwave and 
other technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 But many consumer advocates praised the FCC's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like it's a moderate victory for consumers," said Bradley Stillman, 
legislative director for the Consumer Federation of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Herman, general manager for the Los Angeles Department of 
Telecommunications, which regulates cable providers, said the FCC's first 
attempt at rate regulation left too many loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
 Century Cable, for example, which serves parts of West Los Angeles, Sherman 
Oaks and Eagle Rock, used the new rules to reduce the number of channels on its 
basic service, choosing instead to offer several "a la carte" packages for 
which subscribers had to pay extra, Herman said, adding, "It was a way to 
charge consumers more for less." 
</P>
<P>
 Century officials were unavailable for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Sept. 1, Los Angeles residents have seen their rates go up an average of 
80 cents a month, while the number of channels provided fell, on average, from 
44 to 42, Herman said. Lee Risner, city manager of La Habra, said he has 
received nearly 300 complaints about higher cable bills since September. 
</P>
<P>
 But things may be different this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FCC seems to have recognized that the rates they set the first time 
around were in essence too low, and made it too easy for cable companies to 
evade the intent of the law," Herman said. "Consumers were really beginning to 
feel gouged." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's the cable operators' turn to feel gouged. Says Marc Nathanson, head 
of Los Angeles-based Falcon Cable, the state's largest independent cable 
operator: "It's like rent control coming into your building." 
</P>
<P>
 Nathanson, whose firm serves subscribers in Malibu and San Bernardino, said 
consumers may lose out in the long term as cable operators are forced to scale 
back plans to upgrade plants and provide expanded services such as multichannel 
pay-per-view and interactive entertainment, news and educational programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other cable operators, Falcon is planning to upgrade its network 
with fiber optics that can squeeze 300 channels into the space once occupied by 
50, at a cost of $300 to $600 per subscriber. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathanson blamed the "idiotically written bill" for the fact that rates went 
up for 30% of his customers. The original ruling prevented operators from 
charging for extra outlets and remote controls. As a result, most of the 
subscribers whose rates went down were those who had multiple televisions, and 
those whose went up were the ones who could least afford it, Nathanson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC on Tuesday closed many loopholes that had allowed cable operators to 
boost monthly fees. But last-minute lobbying by cable operators won concessions 
for small cable operators. And reconfiguration of cable program packages may 
mean not all consumers will see a 7% drop once the latest price cut takes 
effect in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, FCC Chairman Reed E. Hundt, asserting that the government has 
finally "broken the back of cable price increases," claimed the new rules will 
save consumers $3 billion a year and will be backed by tough enforcement 
measures against violators. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the greatest consumer savings in the history of American business 
regulation," Hundt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the sweeping claim, the complex new cable rules could end up creating 
more confusion and delivering less than advertised. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10% of the nation's 11,000 cable operators already charge prices below 
the new ceiling, so they can maintain their prices. And 3 million cable 
subscribers get service from small operators, who will not immediately face 
pricing restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the new rules apply only to cable systems not subject to 
effective competition. Currently only a handful of communities, including about 
12 in California, have effective competition in the form of two or more cable 
systems serving the same area. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But emerging competitors, such as Hughes Aircraft Co.'s new direct-broadcast 
satellite system, could be operating in many communities soon. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, like the previous rules, the new regulations cover only basic 
cable, a level that ordinarily includes local broadcast channels and public 
access and government channels. The regulation of basic rates would be handled 
by local officials after they request, as Los Angeles has done, permission from 
the FCC. Prices for premium channels and pay-per-view events remain 
unregulated. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Wilson, acting head of the FCC's cable services bureau, said the agency 
will apply its new pricing rules to non-premium cable channels such as CNN and 
MTV. And, she said, the agency will order sanctions against cable operators 
that reconfigure their program packages not to "enhance customer choice" but 
"to evade pricing regulation." 
</P>
<P>
 Upset by escalating rates and poor service, Congress passed a cable act in 
1992 with the intent of mandating service improvements, lower prices and more 
competition. When the FCC announced a rollback of cable rates last April -- 
mandated by the act -- the agency said its goal was to cut cable bills an 
average of 10% and save consumers $1 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 10 months following those cuts, the nation's 25 largest cable operators 
reported to the FCC that the average regulated revenue per subscriber declined 
to $24.11 per month from $25.61, a drop of 5.9%.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, the FCC survey of these 25 cable operators found that 30.5% of their 
subscribers received increases in their regulated cable fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial markets on Tuesday appeared little affected by the FCC's decision, 
largely because, analysts said, investors had anticipated the rate cut. 
Analysts said the rate cuts will cost cable companies about $600 million a year 
in revenue. Cable revenues have already dropped by about $2 billion since the 
rate rules were imposed last fall. 
</P>

Michaud in Orange County also contributed to this report. The Cost of Cable

</P>
<P>
 Here's what the FCC action would do: 
</P>
<P>
 * Continue a previously announced freeze on cable rates until mid-May, when 
the rules approved Tuesday would take effect. However, the freeze is being 
contested in court by the cable industry. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reduce basic cable rates by about $3 billion a year by rolling back cable 
rates as much as 17% below the levels of Sept. 30, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * Continue a certification process under which local jurisdictions can request 
authority to regulate basic cable rates or relinquish the authority to the 
Federal Communications Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 * Expand the definition of "small cable operator" from those serving 1,000 or 
fewer subscribers to those serving 15,000 or fewer. These operators would not 
immediately be subject to the new rules but would be phased into compliance 
over time. 
</P>
<P>
 * Revise the FCC's treatment of cable operators that reconfigure programming 
into "a la carte" cable channels. The agency wants to ensure that the marketing 
of channels in this fashion is designed to enhance subscriber choice rather 
than evade rate regulation.

JAMES FLANIGAN: OPENING A WINDOW ON THE FED'S THINKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whaddhesay? Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan testified Tuesday 
that economic growth will be slightly above 3% this year and inflation subdued 
at 3% or less. Still, interest rates will have to go up and folks should watch 
the price of gold and other commodities for signs of rising inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 What he didn't say specifically is that short-term interest rates will 
probably rise to 4% by year-end, from 3.25% now, and that long-term rates, 
which influence mortgages, may go to 7% or so -- from 6.6% at present. 
</P>
<P>
 Rate rises of that magnitude won't stall the national economy, which is strong 
at the moment, although they may not do much good for California, which remains 
in the doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, California's best hope is continued strength in the U.S. economy so it 
can take heart from Greenspan's statement that "the outlook is the best we have 
seen in decades." 
</P>
<P>
 And we can all take hints from his thinking on how the economy works, what 
lies ahead and why you may not get a raise but are more likely to have a job. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed feels it must push up interest rates to prevent commodity prices from 
rising, such as those for copper, aluminum and steel that normally increase 
when industry and housing construction heat up. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is not the price of metals but the effect of hikes in copper and 
aluminum on prices for food, cars and housing, the basics of the economy. If 
those prices increased sharply, employees would demand pay raises to keep up 
and serious inflation would occur for the first time in more than a decade. 
"Once inflation gets into wages, it's very difficult to reverse," says David 
Shulman, investment strategist for Salomon Brothers, who like most of Wall 
Street applauded Greenspan's testimony to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan put an interesting perspective on Fed policy: "What we would like to 
foster and replicate are the periods in our past history where we have had 
considerable economic strength without inflationary imbalances occurring." The 
last such period occurred in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the time of 
Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy that is now looked back on as a golden age of 
prosperity and productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Can Greenspan be right to compare this anxious age to that time? He can, but 
first we should remember that there was anxiety in that earlier era as well. 
There was a recession in 1958, and worries about America's ability to keep up 
with a Soviet Union that had launched Sputnik; Kennedy got in a fight with 
business and the stock market swooned in 1962. But through it all there was 
productivity growth -- more output for the same inputs of labor, material and 
investment -- and thus low inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is productivity growth today. Business is expanding now. Spending on 
plant and equipment is rising 15% a year, spurred by purchases of heavy 
industrial machinery as well as computers. 
</P>
<P>
 That's good news because it confirms the economy's long-term improvement. In 
the first stage of that improvement, over the last three years, U.S. industry 
has used cutbacks and downsizing to achieve increases in profits and 
productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 But gains from cutting staff could only take us so far, says economist Stephen 
Roach of Morgan Stanley. "The danger was that the world economy would pick up 
next year and U.S. business would be caught short," says Roach. But now 
investment is expanding U.S. industry's capacity to meet the demands of growing 
markets here and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, today's business investment will prevent bottlenecks as the expansion 
continues. Already, skilled housing construction workers and truck drivers are 
in short supply in many parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Greenspan is using interest rates as a throttle, to moderate 
growth. He wants to ensure that the economy can achieve growth and falling 
unemployment with price stability right through 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 And the fact that he's thinking about 1995 is pertinent to California because 
that's when most experts predict the state will rejoin the growth of the 
overall economy. Would lower interest rates today speed that recovery? Maybe 
and maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
 We should keep in mind that world markets, trading $1 trillion a day in 
securities and currencies, determine interest rates far more than the Fed these 
days. Any sign that the U.S. central bank was risking higher inflation to hold 
rates down would arouse global markets to drive up U.S. rates far faster than 
Greenspan is doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Those markets are already wary, as Greenspan said in taking note of the gold 
price and of investors' "desire to hold hard objects rather than currencies." 
All over the world, people invest in gold as a hedge against inflation. The 
Chinese are buying gold today because inflation is rising in China's rapidly 
growing economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But concerns about more than China are involved in gold's 16% rise to $378 an 
ounce from a low point of $326 an ounce last March 10. That surge reflects the 
markets' wariness about Clinton Administration intentions and about budgetary 
effects of its health and economic policies. The markets may recall that the 
prosperous Eisenhower-Kennedy years were followed by the expansion of another 
government policy called the Vietnam War, which started the momentous inflation 
of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Are market fears justified today? Probably not. But in any case, an expanding 
U.S. economy based on business investment and productivity increases is the 
best response to their wariness. And that's what Greenspan is trying to ensure 
with his cautious words and careful interest rate policies.

MCDONNELL MAY SELL STAKE TO ITALIAN FIRM; AEROSPACE: IF A DEAL IS MADE, IT 
COULD GIVE STRUGGLING DOUGLAS AIRCRAFT THE CAPITAL IT NEEDS TO DEVELOP NEW 
AIRLINERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas Corp., which failed to sell part of its Douglas Aircraft 
commercial division to Taiwan Aerospace two years ago, is now in talks to sell 
a minority stake in the operation to an aerospace company owned by the Italian 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 If the deal goes through, it could provide struggling Douglas Aircraft with 
several hundred million dollars that it needs to develop a new generation of 
airliners. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas is holding the talks with Finmeccanica, which is 90%-owned by the 
Italian state holding company, Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale, or 
IRI. The holding company confirmed Tuesday that it gave Finmeccanica permission 
to discuss the possible purchase of the stake in Douglas, which employs 11,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian news reports indicated that between 10% and 20% of Douglas could be 
sold, but a Finmeccanica official said the size of the stake and its price were 
yet to be negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for McDonnell and Douglas Aircraft declined to comment on the talks. 
However, Douglas spokesman John Thom noted that a Finmeccanica division, 
Alenia, has been a Douglas subcontractor for three decades and currently builds 
fuselage panels for Douglas' MD-11 wide body and MD-80 narrow-body airliners. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy's national airline, Alitalia, which is controlled by IRI, is also a 
Douglas customer. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell has been scouring the globe for a financial partner since its 
attempt to sell 40% of Douglas to Taiwan Aerospace for $2 billion fell apart in 
1992 because the parties couldn't come to terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas and industry analysts view such a cash infusion as crucial if Douglas 
is to reverse its steady loss of customers to industry leader Boeing Co. and 
Europe's Airbus Industrie consortium. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas' struggle to generate new sales, and a worldwide recession in the 
commercial aircraft industry, have forced the firm to lay off nearly 75% of its 
work force, from a peak of about 42,000 people in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Those factors also forced Douglas to virtually stop development of its 
next-generation airliner, the MD-12, a 500-seat jumbo jet that the company had 
once hoped would be ready for service in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell Chairman John F. McDonnell said in a speech a year ago that the 
company was "pushing ahead with serious discussions with potential partners 
interested in sharing in the risks and rewards of the commercial aircraft 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the escalating costs of developing new generations of aircraft, 
international partnerships in one form or another have become an industry 
prerequisite," McDonnell said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, analyst Paul Nisbet of the aerospace consulting firm JSA Research Inc. 
in Newport, R.I., said Douglas is looking not only for cash but also for 
technology that would help limit the total cost of a new airplane. Those 
savings would make Douglas more competitive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want technical improvement as well as a financial improvement," Nisbet 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Taiwanese deal was being negotiated, McDonnell was in much worse 
financial shape than it is today. But due to the layoffs and other major 
cost-cutting steps, it is now solidly profitable and has been significantly 
cutting its debt. Douglas Aircraft had an operating profit of $40 million last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, 40% ownership in Douglas today is probably worth between $1 
billion and $1.5 billion -- compared to the $2 billion the Taiwanese were 
considering paying -- because of Douglas' continued sales problems and the 
weakness in the airliner market, Nisbet said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Italian talks were disclosed, McDonnell's stock jumped $2 to a 
record $122.125 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

JAPAN GIVES UP ON ANALOG-BASED HDTV SYSTEM; TECHNOLOGY: GOVERNMENT SAYS 
U.S.-BACKED DIGITAL FORMAT IS LIKELY TO BECOME A WORLD STANDARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a stunning admission of failure, Japan said Tuesday it will abandon the 
high-definition TV system that it has spent years developing, in favor of an 
American-backed digital standard for the new technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's Posts and Telecommunications Ministry said it abandoned its analog 
technology because the all-digital U.S. system is likely to become a world 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, which tarnishes Japan's reputation for technological prowess in 
consumer electronics, goes beyond television as entertainment. High-definition 
TV, with cinematic images and crystalline sound, is expected to be the means by 
which consumers and businesses access information, visit and possibly even 
commute using the high-capacity information infrastructure of tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, Japan jumped off to a big lead in HDTV research, a lead 
that was the cause of much worry over U.S. competitiveness. But the ability to 
express information digitally is at the heart of the information age, and 
American researchers soon pioneered a digital standard for television. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, three U.S. groups that had been vying to develop a proprietary system 
to serve as the U.S. standard for HDTV joined forces to pool their expertise 
and share royalties from the new technology. Earlier this month, the consortium 
recommended a digital transmission standard that would accommodate computer 
users, over-the-air broadcasts and cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
 A digital system converts the sounds and images of a television broadcast into 
numerical codes, transmits them that way and then converts the codes back into 
identical sounds and images when they are delivered to the home. That results 
in a clearer picture than analog systems, which use signals much like those 
used for TV and radio transmissions today. 
</P>
<P>
 The change to a digital standard will prove costly for Japanese electronics 
companies, who are among the world's leading producers of television sets and 
other consumer electronics. It will also require that the nation's TV stations 
convert to expensive new digital equipment.

 Iwerks to Acquire Omni Films: The company said it signed a definitive 
agreement to acquire Omni Films International Inc. for about $34 million in 
cash and shares. "The acquisition of Omni Films establishes Iwerks' Attractions 
and Technologies Division as the single dominant company in the high-growth 
ride simulation industry," said Stanley B. Kinsey, Iwerks Entertainment Inc. 
chairman and chief executive, in a news release. Burbank-based Iwerks said 
Omni's products are less costly to build than Iwerks' products and that they 
sell especially well in Asia.

 CalFed to Sell 44 Branches: California Federal Bank signed a definitive 
agreement to sell its 43 Florida branches and one Georgia office to NationsBank 
Corp. for about $160 million, or 4.10% of the branches' $4 billion in 
deposits.The all-cash sale, which has been approved by the boards of directors 
of both banks but which is subject to regulatory approval, should close in the 
third quarter of 1994. CalFed had previously announced its intention to sell 
the branches as part of its "hold and fix" recapitalization strategy. 
NationsBank said the purchase will boost its Florida deposits to more than $19 
billion and its offices to 402.

 FDIC Fund Recovered Last Year: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said its 
pool of funds to protect depositors swelled to a $13.1-billion surplus as the 
number of bank failures hit a 12-year low.The FDIC, which administers the Bank 
Insurance Fund, said the surplus marked a massive turnaround from twin deficits 
in 1991 and 1992. The regulatory agency cited improved industry conditions and 
the agency's cost-control efforts as the main reasons for the fund's strong 
performance. "The recapitalization of the Bank Insurance Fund is a success 
story for the banking industry, the American taxpayer and the FDIC," Chairman 
Andrew Hove said.

 Unocal Wants to Take Over Asian Project: The Los Angeles-based oil company 
said it will seek to replace Texaco Inc. as developer of a Chinese natural gas 
prospect after Texaco withdrew from contract talks because the financial terms 
weren't attractive enough. Texaco, based in White Plains, N.Y., said last week 
that it couldn't reach agreement with Shanghai Petroleum Corp. after about a 
year of negotiations on financial terms for development of the Ping Hu prospect 
in the East China Sea. Unocal Corp. was outbid by Texaco during the initial 
bidding on the rights to the prospect, which is about 250 miles east of 
Shanghai.

 U.S.-Russia Pact Will Aid ICN: ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. already sells drugs in 
Russia, including Virazole, which is used to treat infants hospitalized with 
respiratory infections.But the Costa Mesa drug maker said in a statement that 
the agreement will help its business because it will mean wider distribution 
for its products. The two countries agreed last week that any U.S. drug already 
approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration will be approved in Russia 
within 90 days. An ICN spokesman also said construction should start "in the 
near future" on a $40-million drug factory the company is building in St.

 Vance Named Mediator in Macy Bankruptcy: A federal judge appointed former 
Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance to help speed up the complex talks aimed at 
getting R.H. Macy & Co. out of Bankruptcy Court.The judge also ordered Macy to 
submit to Vance by March 8 the principal terms and conditions of its 
reorganization plan. Creditors may also submit their own outlines for a 
reorganization plan. The appointment of Vance was unexpected but welcomed by 
both sides. The judge also granted Macy an extension, until Aug. 1, to file an 
actual reorganization plan with the court. The previous deadline was to expire

WILL 'SNOW WHITE' DWARF OTHER VIDEOS?; HOME ENTERTAINMENT: REVERSING POLICY, 
DISNEY WILL ALLOW CLASSIC ANIMATED FILM TO GO ON SALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Walt Disney Co., which once vowed it would never release its classic film 
"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" on home video, said Tuesday it will do just 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney said it will release the animated feature -- the last video holdout in 
its library -- for a limited period this fall, in time for the holiday shopping 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives of the Burbank firm maintained in the past that they would not 
release "Snow White" in home video for fear such a move would jeopardize the 
value of the film in theatrical exhibition. Disney has released "Snow White" 
nine times since it premiered in 1937, taking in an estimated $700 million at 
the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have found over the last 10 years is that the value of these movies 
has not at all been diminished by their release into home video," said Jeffrey 
Katzenberg, president of Walt Disney Studios. "It's frankly taken a long time 
where we feel comfortable taking out the crown jewel." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last several years, Disney has recycled films such as "Pinocchio" 
through the theatrical and home video markets without apparent detriment. 
"Pinocchio" was first released on home video in 1985, subsequently re-released 
in the movie theaters a couple of years later and currently is available on 
home video until April. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite clear from testing the waters with 'Aladdin,' 'Beauty and the 
Beast' and 'Pinocchio' that this kind of release can unleash tremendous profits 
for them," said Harold Vogel, an entertainment analyst at Merril Lynch. 
"There's no reason to sit on it." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Vogel also suggested that among the factors motivating Disney to 
release "Snow White" now for home viewing are the financial problems of its 
Euro Disney theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 "That situation is not pleasant for them to go through, and this may be one 
way of offsetting any future problems in reinvesting in Euro Disney," Vogel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney made the "Snow White" announcement at its annual shareholders' meeting 
at Disney World in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting, Disney officials said 1994 is shaping up as an "even better 
year" than 1993. The company did not quarrel with analyst estimates that Disney 
will earn more than $2 per share this year, compared to $1.63 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue from "Snow White" could surpass the home video release last year of 
"Aladdin," which to date has sold more than 24 million units. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney also announced that it reached an agreement with Olympic figure skater 
Nancy Kerrigan to produce a TV movie based on her life and an ice skating 
special in which she will star.

 Sony May Sell Part of Movie Business: Sony Corp. has retained Furman Selz Inc. 
to sell a portion of its U.S. studio operations, according to investment 
bankers close to the transaction.Principal Roy Furman is personally helping the 
Japanese electronics and entertainment conglomerate seek a buyer, a person at 
the investment firm said. New Yorker magazine said in this week's issue that 
Sony hopes to sell about 25% of its motion picture division for $3 billion, 
valuing the entire division at $12 billion. That price would represent a 
massive premium to the $3.4 billion Sony spent when it purchased Sony Pictures 
and TriStar Entertainment from Coca-Cola Co. in 1989. Analysts expressed doubt 
that Sony could get that much.

JAPAN ALLUDES TO NON-BINDING TRADE TARGETS; ASIA: HOSOKAWA AIDE SAYS SUCH GOALS 
COULD WIN APPROVAL, HEADING OFF MORE CONFLICT WITH THE U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ichiro Ozawa, chief strategist of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
coalition, suggested Tuesday that Japan could accept non-binding targets in its 
trade with the United States instead of the specific goals, backed by the 
threat of sanctions, that Washington is demanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Without elaborating, Ozawa flatly predicted that the U.S.-Japan trade "problem 
will be brought to a conclusion next month." 
</P>
<P>
 Ozawa, the No. 2 leader and policy-maker of the Japan Renewal Party, made his 
comments at a news conference with foreign correspondents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Accepting numerical goals to be implemented by the government is, indeed, 
managed trade," he said, referring to the practice of government dictating to 
private industry. "However, if you are talking about mutual goals for efforts, 
that's not a bad thing." 
</P>
<P>
 At a Feb. 11 Clinton-Hosokawa summit in Washington, the Japanese officials 
rejected U.S. demands, saying that setting specific goals for reduction of 
Japan's trade surplus with the United States would be undesirable. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure to achieve agreement in Washington raised the specter of a 
tit-for-tat trade war. But since Hosokawa's return to Japan, his government has 
been discussing ways to encourage more American imports, thereby cutting 
Japan's trade surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And despite the lack of formal negotiations, Ozawa's comments, coming from a 
key powerbroker in the coalition, reflect a continuing Japanese effort at 
compromise.  
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, a spokesman for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative 
said the agency had no immediate comment on Ozawa's statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozawa blamed the impasse at the Washington summit on a mixture of the United 
States' "incorrect" insistence on numerical targets and Hosokawa's troubles at 
home in winning approval for a historic political reform plan. The prime 
minister, he explained, did not have enough time to make domestic "political 
adjustments" before he met Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once this problem is taken care of, Hosokawa's leadership will become very 
firm, and Japan-U.S. adjustments will become possible," Ozawa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Any economic damage Japan might suffer from U.S. sanctions would "not amount 
to much" in the near term, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Ozawa warned that any U.S. resort to sanctions would "only stir 
up nationalism in both countries." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "America must not carry out sanctions -- unless it intends to 
destroy Japan and once more repeat the history of U.S.-Japan relations."

San Francisco-based real estate development firm was under fire from the 
California Public Employees Retirement System, which owns 46% of Catellus 
stock. CalPERS invested $400 million in equity to help start up Catellus in 
1989 and had seen its shares decline in value by more than 75%. Catellus also

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: WHAT TO SELL, WHAT TO KEEP IF YOU'RE BECOMING ANTSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The stock market has been unable to find its feet for the last two weeks, in 
the wake of the Federal Reserve's high-stakes decision to tighten credit for 
the first time since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 With every wobbly session, market pros and novices alike are forced to face 
the questions they most despise: When do I sell? And what do I sell? 
</P>
<P>
 The agony may be most acute for small investors who have owned individual 
stocks or funds for years and are sitting on large profits. Few investors want 
to believe that a bear market could be in the wings, after all. And even those 
who have convinced themselves that they're in stocks for the long haul -- and 
so don't need to ponder the sell question -- still feel pressure at times like 
this. 
</P>
<P>
 So let's say you have that antsy feeling that it's time to take some money off 
the table, now that short-term interest rates are on the rise. If the broad 
market goes down from here -- in a classic "correction" of 10% or so, or a 
deeper drop -- which stocks are most, and least, vulnerable? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps surprisingly, many money managers say they wouldn't sell the 
industrial stocks that have been the market's leaders over the past year. 
Although a large number of these issues, including Chrysler, Caterpillar, Deere 
and General Electric, have racked up hefty price gains, institutional investors 
seem particularly reluctant to take those profits and exit the stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There's good reason for that attitude: These companies continue to surprise 
Wall Street with their earnings recoveries as the economy expands. Take farm 
equipment giant Deere. On Tuesday, it reported earnings of $87 million in its 
first quarter ended Jan. 31. Analysts had expected Deere to earn about half 
that. Stunned, investors pushed the stock up $5.25 to $82.50 on Tuesday. It's 
now almost double its '93 low of $42.375. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's the trend longer-term for these (industrials); people don't 
understand the earnings leverage in these companies" as the economy grows, 
argues Charles Mayer, manager of the Invesco Industrial Income stock fund in 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Kelly, principal at Spectrum Asset Management in Newport Beach, agrees 
with Mayer. People are nervous because the industrial stocks' prices have 
zoomed, he says. But as Kelly calculates the companies' earnings potential in a 
recovery, their rate of return on capital and their stock prices relative to 
interest rates, he finds many still are good values. 
</P>
<P>
 GE, at $108 a share, has risen 34% from its 1993 low. But Kelly calculates 
that a bear market low price for GE would be $70, while its bull market peak 
should be around $190. With that much potential upside left, Kelly sees no 
reason to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there could be a lot of wishful groupthink going on here. It's hard 
to say "goodby" to a winner, after all. And while fundamental investors may not 
sell the industrials if trouble hits, the short-term traders in these stocks 
could cause plenty of damage if they bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the central point of the industrial stocks' fans is logical: If the 
economy continues to grow, these firms will sell more, and years of 
cost-cutting will send added revenue directly to the bottom line. Even if 
interest rates rise, investors should find the industrials' big earnings gains 
hard to ignore in '94 and perhaps '95. 
</P>
<P>
 Then what do you sell at this stage of the bull market? Some ideas: 
</P>
<P>
 * Financial stocks. Technically, the banks, the brokerages and the mortgage 
lenders are cheap stocks, after their '93 selloffs. And it's true that a 
gradual rise in interest rates shouldn't do extreme damage to financial 
companies' earnings. But psychologically, every notch up in rates is likely to 
slam these stocks, some pros say. If you have a profit, take it and find a 
better idea, they suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Wolf, executive vice president at IDS Advisory Corp. in Minneapolis, has 
sold out his stakes in Merrill Lynch and insurer General Re. At Wedge Capital 
Management in Charlotte, N.C., research chief Michael Kucera says his firm 
recently let go of Federal National Mortgage after owning it for nearly four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Electric and phone utilities. Like the financials, utilities have been badly 
battered by the turn in interest rates. Is it too late to sell? No, says 
Invesco's Mayer. Especially in the case of the electric utilities, he says, "I 
just don't see the growth potential" longer-term. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayer notes that regulation and competition are squeezing many utilities' 
earnings. Without strong earnings, there won't be strong dividend growth. So he 
has been culling Niagara Mohawk and Illinois Power, among others, from his 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Mahoney, manager of the GT Global Telecommunications stock fund in San 
Francisco, has been dumping phone utilities US West and Pacific Telesis. 
PacTel, by recently spinning off its fastest-growing businesses (such as 
cellular), has left itself with meager growth prospects, Mahoney says. "My 
feeling is that it's not a terrible dog but that we can do better," he says.

 * Consumer stocks. Drug, food and tobacco stocks have been slumping for two 
years. They rally periodically, but IDS' Wolf believes any rally is a good 
opportunity to sell these stars of the '80s. Why? Wolf sees no sign that the 
companies' profit margins are improving; if anything, they're likely to get 
worse, he says, pressured on one end by rising commodity prices and on the 
other by heated competition for consumers' dollars. Time to Trim?

 Although still recovering from the political instability of the 1980s and hurt 
more recently by natural disasters and the closing of U.S. military bases, the 
country has seen investment and growth increase slowly. The primary limit on 
the economy is a lack of adequate electricity. After infrastructure 
improvements, sustained growth is more likely in the next few years. Strong 
natural and human resources give the nation a head start. 
</P>
<P>
 Resources: Coal and hydroelectricity have reduced the nation's dependence on 
imported oil from 95% of energy supply in 1979 to 60% in 1990. Fishing, which 
accounts for 5% of exports, has boomed with sales of shrimp to Japan. Extensive 
cutting has depleted forests, but mining remains important, with gold, silver, 
copper, nickel, iron, lead and chromium in rich deposits. The Philippines is 
the world's eighth-largest gold producer. 
</P>
<P>
 Power: The shortage of power-generating capacity is estimated to have cost the 
economy about $1.3 billion in lost output in 1993. It also has secondary 
effects on employment and consumer spending. Because of the long brownouts in 
the Manila area, many firms have reduced work hours and unemployment has 
reached 25%. But new power plants are starting to come on line. 
</P>
<P>
 Exports: The Philippines is the world's leading exporter of coconut products, 
but their relative importance has declined and now they make up about 10% of 
exports. Increasingly important now are electronics (19% of exports in 1990) 
and textiles (16%). Bananas and handicrafts have also become growth industries. 
Overall, agriculture provides about a third of export revenue and employs about 
40% of the labor force. 
</P>
<P>
 Potential: An English-speaking labor force, extensive natural resources and a 
large domestic market put the Philippines in a strong position as it faces 
competition from China, Vietnam and Indonesia. Top priority now is to address 
structural defects that have held the nation back, such as insufficient 
revenue, large corporate monopolies and unequal distribution of wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 Working Abroad: Despite the international recession, the number of Filipinos 
working abroad, especially in Asia and the Middle East, has steadily increased. 
Without the $2.2 billion in remittances from these workers in 1992, the GNP 
would not have grown.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; SPOTLIGHT ON THE PHILIPPINES; WHEN DOING BUSINESS THERE 
...

 The Philippines is a developing country with a strong American presense. 
However, its Asian culture, along with colonial Spanish influence, brings out 
key differences that U.S. business executives may encounter in their ventures 
there. DO: 
</P>
<P>
 Make appointments at least a day in advance. Phone calls are fine, but you may 
be asked to send something on a company's letterhead--it provides 
identification. Fax machines are common. In fact, many chief executives have 
fax connections at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Hire lawyers and accountants. The Philippine Bar Association and the 
Integrated Bar of the Philippines are good sources for local law firms. Others 
include U.S. international law and accounting firms with affiliations in the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 Rent cars, but use a chauffeur. In Manila, Avis, Hertz and major rental 
companies provide them for $80 every eight hours on a mid-size car with mileage 
limitations. Chauffeur services are useful with the city's traffic and parking 
problems. Besides, most taxis are old and unreliable, and meters run up fast 
with Manila's traffic congestions. 
</P>
<P>
 Expect Philippine executives to work as well as Americans. Many have been 
trained here, or under comparable systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Realize that Philippine banks are generally reliable. They're centrally 
regulated. Reputed banks like the Bank of the Philippine Islands have 
operations in Los Angeles. Citibank and Bank of America also have branches in 
the Philippines. Note that interest rates are high, with present lending rates 
ranging from 16% to 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 Check with the Philippine Consulate General or the Philippine Trade Office for 
the latest information on investment laws. New incentives in areas like 
ownership, taxes and stock offerings have been added or changed specifically to 
attract foreign investors. DON'T: 
</P>
<P>
 Be offended if someone's late. Filipinos tend to be a little more flexible 
with appointment times, so allow about 15 to 20 minutes. However, that norm is 
gradually changing in Manila and other major cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Expect phone connections to work as well when calling outside major cities. 
Telecommunications is expanding rapidly, and that would change soon enough. Pay 
phones may not be as widespread, but you can always rent a cellular phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear taking business disputes to courts. The Philippine judicial system is 
modeled after the United States, and cases are handled in similar ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Rely completely on traveler's checks. Although accepted at banks and American 
Express offices, they are not always accepted elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Be too blunt. Instead, beat around the bush a little--it's considered polite. 
If there's something you disagree with, do it subtly, but don't mislead, 
especially in a business negotiation. Filipinos emphasize hospitality, and will 
try to accommodate your needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Settle for verbal agreements without eventually securing legal contracts. A 
handshake means a lot, but a signed legal agreement is what stands in court 
during disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 Reject invitations to dinners with families and social events if at all 
possible. Filipinos value the personal side of business and will consider 
friendly relationships part of any transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Bribe--it's against the law. Occasionally, you may be approached for it at 
airport customs. Ask to see the supervisor instead. LINUS CHUA

'FAUST' TO OPEN OPERA SEASON; MUSIC: L.A. OPERA WILL STAGE EIGHT WORKS THIS 
SEASON, ONE MORE THAN LAST YEAR. THE FINANCIAL BOTTOM LINE IS MAKING 
CO-PRODUCTIONS NECESSARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Peter Sellars production of Debussy's "Pelleas et Melisande" conducted by 
Simon Rattle and a rare look at Handel's "Xerxes" highlight a 1994-95 L.A. 
Opera season otherwise full of operas and productions familiar to the company's 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight operas are once again scheduled (after a drop to seven last season) and 
54 performances. The only new production to premiere locally will be a "Faust" 
with a director and designer to be announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Placido Domingo appears only in five performances of "Otello," an opera he's 
sung here twice before. Contemporary opera is once again absent -- unless you 
count "Porgy and Bess" -- and the prospects for Wagner (represented by only one 
opera in the company's history) remain "bright but distant." 
</P>
<P>
 The schedule for the ninth season of Music Center Opera was announced by 
General Director Peter Hemmings at a press conference Tuesday in the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Times are extremely hard for the arts generally," Hemmings said, "not just in 
L.A. or America but all over the world." He said the company's subscriptions 
sales had increased during the previous season but ticket purchases for 
"unfamiliar pieces" remained a problem, as did the ongoing search for 
contributed income. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial bottom line makes co-productions a necessity, and the delay in 
announcing the "Faust" creative team was attributed by Hemmings to one of the 
two unnamed other theaters that plan to share the staging not yet confirming 
the arrangement. He said the information should be available in the next few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Other notable partnerships: "Xerxes" (originally "Serse") will be the 
company's contribution to another "U.K./L.A. Festival," he said, and the 
"Pelleas" (set in Malibu) will be in association with the L.A. Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemmings cited "Porgy and Bess" (a new production, funded with 11 other 
presenters, including the Houston Grand Opera) and this season's "El Gato 
Montes" as "operas that appeal to audiences other than conventional operatic 
audiences" and thus a way to help enlarge the company's potential public. The 
cast for "Porgy" "s currently being auditioned," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the season itself, the company is producing a videotape of "El Gato 
Montes," Hemmings said. Shot during three performances last month, the 
videotape is currently being edited and will probably be seen on PBS, he said. 
</P>
<P>

THE PARTY'S NOT OVER FOR KIROV SINGER; MUSIC: FOR SOPRANO GALINA GORCHAKOVA, 
THE END OF COMMUNISM HAS MEANT MORE OPPORTUNITIES. SHE SINGS 'MADAMA BUTTERFLY' 
BEGINNING TONIGHT AT THE MUSIC CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 may have pitched Russia and the Soviet 
republics immeasurably into turmoil, but it helped a chosen few artists such as 
soprano Galina Gorchakova launch international careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in exactly the right place at the right time after all that happened," 
Gorchakova said last week in her dressing room at the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion. She will sing the title role of Puccini's "Madama Butterfly" for the 
Los Angeles Music Center Opera, opening tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, during communism, if you had some relatives in the Party, you got the 
parts," she said, speaking through a translator. "I didn't have any relatives 
in the Party. Definitely, I wouldn't have gotten to go and perform in America 
or in Italy, as I have done. Right now, it's all up to the artists. If I want 
to go and perform, I just go." 
</P>
<P>
 A principal artist with the Kirov Opera in St. Petersburg, Gorchakova first 
gained international acclaim when she sang Renata in Prokofiev's "The Fiery 
Angel" with the Kirov at Covent Garden in London and later, again with the 
Kirov, at the Metropolitan Opera in New York in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, she appeared in the weeklong Rimsky-Korsakov festival at 
the Kirov and also sang Cio-Cio San at the Houston Grand Opera.  
</P>
<P>
 "Before Gorbachev, it was the government that sponsored all the theaters -- 
the opera, the musicians and artists," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we have to support ourselves. It's probably harder that way, but 
we're doing it by getting money from some private sponsors -- like corporations 
or banks. In the Kirov Theater, we (also) have people who are like your 
founders, like the Founders Circle here." 
</P>
<P>
 Or, if they have the talent like her, they go abroad to sing and earn hard 
currency. Gorchakova said she is paid in rubles at the Kirov. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably harder, in a way," she agreed, "but on the other hand, the 
musical director of the Kirov Theater, Valery Gergiev, has a lot of connections 
in different countries." 
</P>
<P>
 Gorchakova has traveled a long way from her native Siberian city of 
Novosibirsk, about 1,700 miles from Moscow. "I grew up in Siberia, but in the 
cultural center of Siberia," she stressed. "There is a big opera house there." 
</P>
<P>
 That was where she saw her first Tatiana in Tchaikovsky's "Yevgeny Onegin," 
which decided her future. "And that was my first part at the Kirov," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother never dreamed of my being a big opera star. She just wanted me to 
sing in an opera house. That was the goal. But, yes, I always wanted to be an 
opera singer." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While studying at the Novosibirsk Conservatory, she met her husband, Nikolai 
Mikhalski, a bass. The two have a 7-year-old son, Andrei, who takes piano 
lessons and likes opera "a lot." Andrei right now is in school at home, St. 
Petersburg, and Nikolai is singing in a new production there. "So I'm traveling 
by myself." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the great Russian roles, she also learned Italian operas -- in 
Italian, she was careful to note. "Italian, definitely. The first time I sang 
'Butterfly' in Italian was at the Kirov Theater, and then I came to Houston and 
sang it." 
</P>
<P>
 Her vocal models, she said, included Maria Callas, Renata Scotto and, she 
added with a laugh, the great Russian bass Chaliapin. 
</P>
<P>
 What about Galina Vishnevskaya, who as of 1978 was a non-person in the Soviet 
Union? (Vishnevskaya and her husband, cellist and conductor Mstislav 
Rostropovich, were stripped of Soviet citizenship and denounced as "ideological 
renegades" a year after they settled in the United States in 1977. Both had 
their citizenship restored in 1990 during the era of perestroika.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard her only four years ago," Gorchakova said, "because until then it was 
hard to get her recordings. I heard her in a recording of Shostakovich's 'Lady 
Macbeth of Mtsensk,' and I liked it a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 But by then it was too late for Vishnevskaya to serve as a role model. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, at that point, she felt ready for the rigors of a professional career 
"because I knew it already. It's the same everywhere, the opera life, whether 
in Los Angeles or St. Petersburg or Novosibirsk. And I was ready, because I was 
grown up." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, one thing that's different in the West, she acknowledged, is the 
heavier emphasis on stage direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Kirov, the main thing is still the music," she said. "Everything is 
working just for the music. And it should be a nice alliance. It shouldn't be 
just for the stage director, the whole production." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she is happy with Christopher Harlan, who inherited direction of this 
production from Ian Judge. "I like directors who have good taste," she said. 
</P>

 Judge staged the premiere production for the Music Center Opera in 1991. Maria 
Ewing sang the title role then, interpreting it darkly right from the start. 
"That was her vision, but not mine," Gorchakova said. "Mine is more 
conventional." 
</P>
<P>
 She added: "The acting part is hard. Tosca can be done in different ways, but 
Butterfly should be definitely Japanese. I've tried everything. I do my best. 
But I'm sorry I'm not small." 
</P>
<P>
 The vocal demands of the role, however, hold no terrors for her. She plans to 
take the top D-flat at the end of the entrance aria, for instance, unlike Ewing 
and others who opt for the lower alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will sing all the high notes," Gorchakova said firmly.

COMPACT LAUGHTER; COMEDY: TODAY'S PERFORMERS ARE SURPRISED THAT FANS ARE 
REDISCOVERING RECORDED HUMOR, THANKS TO CDS. 
</P>

 Once told, even the finest jokes fade away into the ether. But if tape is 
rolling and a record company is willing, the laughter may not be so fickle: 
Gags captured on a CD can be laughed at forever. 
</P>
<P>
 An increasing number of record buyers are rediscovering the pleasures of 
recorded comedy, and comedians are finding that a digital document of their 
work offers relative permanence, increased accessibility, and, quite often, a 
potent boost to the career. 
</P>
<P>
 "My CD has changed my career and my life," says veteran stand-up Paul Mooney. 
Having spent 15 years as a writing partner with Richard Pryor, Mooney's no 
stranger to recorded comedy. But last year he experienced it first-hand with 
the release of "Race," a collection of highly provocative, racially charged 
material from Mooney's stand-up performances at the Punchline in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 As any fan of Pryor, George Carlin, Cheech and Chong or Firesign Theatre might 
be quick to point out, comedy records are not a new idea. Those comedians' 
respective albums became breakout successes in the '70s, and, even before then, 
comics ranging from Bob Newhart to Lenny Bruce to Bill Cosby gained wider 
audiences with comedy LPs. But now, as vinyl has given way to digital 
technology, comics and comedy fans are showing a renewed interest in laughs on 
disc. 
</P>
<P>
 "People knew about me before, but the recognition and attention I'm getting 
now from the record is great," says Mooney, who has a five-record comedy deal. 
"I've heard that at a university somewhere in England they're studying the 
record in a sociology class. The record's got a life of its own, and I 
absolutely love that. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Now that I've got a record out, you can hear me whether you're in your car or 
in prison. I can be anywhere. Pygmies could be asking me for autographs soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty of non-pygmies have been snapping up comedy-related recordings, 
according to current pop charts. Musical gagster Weird Al Yankovic is scoring 
with "Alapalooza," his 10th collection of gently subversive pop parodies. The 
engagingly dim team of Beavis and Butt-head have a Billboard Top 10 hit with 
their goofy deconstructions of rock tunes. Many classic comedy albums of the 
'60s and '70s are selling again as CD reissues. And some stand-ups are finding 
themselves among heavyweight company on local pop charts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in Roanoke, Va., a few weeks ago," says comic Jeff Foxworthy, "and my 
comedy album was the No. 3-selling record behind Pearl Jam and Snoop Doggy 
Dogg. I was ahead of Meat Loaf! I was shocked." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Foxworthy's record "You Might Be a Redneck If . . ." contains material culled 
from stand-up concert appearances at the Majestic Theater in Dallas, and was 
released last June. The comedian has had his share of career successes, 
including eight "Tonight Show" appearances and HBO and Showtime specials. But 
the success of the album continues to thrill and surprise him, especially since 
he first approached the recording with some reluctance. 
</P>
<P>
 "My manager came up with the idea, and I said, 'Nobody buys comedy albums 
anymore. We're wasting our time.' A hundred thousand copies later, I just keep 
saying, 'Wow.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Comedian Martin Lawrence was also reluctant to put out a record, but now 
counts the emphatically ribald "Talkin' S---" as a proud piece of work. His 
record, released in September, is approaching gold status. Recorded partly at 
the Comedy Store, it offers fans a re-playable club experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you hear some powerful comedy on a CD," he says, "it's almost like you 
can touch the performer. I recorded my album at clubs with people right up 
under me, so along with the comedy, you're hearing all the little things you'd 
hear in a club. The fans have really enjoyed it, and the industry respects its 
success. I started out thinking, 'Who needs a comedy album?' and now I'm ready 
to do my second." 
</P>
<P>
 As the star of Fox's "Martin," the host of HBO's "Def Comedy Jam" and with the 
concert film "You So Crazy" due out March 11, Lawrence is already enjoying life 
as a high-profile comic. But he feels that his CD has given him a chance to 
forge an even stronger connection with his audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to have your comedy exist in a way that people can hear it whenever 
they want to, and the CD gave me a way to give people something of quality. Now 
they can listen to me in their cars and have something to laugh at instead of 
worrying about drive-bys." 
</P>
<P>
 Some comedians fear that the material on a record has to be retired once it's 
been widely heard, but Foxworthy says that his experience proves otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had just started doing concerts when the album came out, and I figured the 
album was 50 minutes of material I couldn't use. It was just the opposite -- 
people got upset if I didn't use that material. I'd see people backstage who'd 
say, 'I brought 20 people to hear you do the thing about your wife's cold butt. 
Why didn't you do it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Among working comics, the king of comedy albums would have to be George 
Carlin. Beginning with "FM & AM" in 1972, Carlin quickly unleashed a string of 
four gold records that widely established him as an irreverent and incisive 
voice of the counterculture. He's continued to record since that time, and has 
seen his comedy make the jumps from vinyl to eight-track to cassette to CD. 
He's still taking inspired potshots at the powers that be. And he's still 
setting new standards for stand-up performance: His most recent record, adapted 
from his "Jammin' in N.Y." HBO special, is up for a Grammy next week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This may not be unusual for a comic to say, but I like for everybody to hear 
my stuff," Carlin admits. "And, having been a disc jockey early in my career, 
looking at a shelf and seeing records with my name on them means something to 
me. In some ways, the records are simply a by-product of my performances and my 
HBO specials, but they're also something I can hold, and look at as proof of my 
work. I put my videos next to my records and I feel satisfied about what I've 
done. That's a good time for a deep sigh." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlin's first three albums were repackaged as a two-disc set a little over a 
year ago, and continue to sell well alongside his more recent records. As for 
the enduring popularity of his work, the star of his own Fox sitcom feels that 
though he's still capable of outraging pillars of the establishment, his fans 
listen to his legacy of comic rants with a great deal of affection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm like the friendly uncle who's full of opinions. A well-liked 
pain-in-the-butt. 'George said God should do what? Well, that's just George.' I 
think that's the attitude toward me. It's nice to know that the older stuff is 
still appreciated, and I'm happy to still be out there, hacking away." 
</P>
<P>
 One young comic who cites Carlin's work as an influence is "Saturday Night 
Live's" Adam Sandler. His recently released debut album, "They're All Gonna 
Laugh at You!," is currently doing respectably well on the Billboard charts. 
Sandler's record is a change of pace from the usual concert recording, as he 
put his stand-up material aside and developed sketches and musical numbers 
loosely based on his memories of high school and college. Over a three-day 
period, he recorded the new material in a studio with a cast that included 
Conan O'Brien, fellow "SNL" member Rob Schneider and several of the "SNL" 
writers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you can most honestly capture what your comedy's about on a record," 
Sandler says. "I had the kind of total control over this material that I would 
never have on TV or in a movie. There's a side of me that's just impossible for 
NBC to air, and that's what ended up on the record." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandler's record may eventually duplicate the success of the self-titled debut 
from New York's prank phone-call specialists, the Jerky Boys. The pair's 
collection of odd calls to unsuspecting victims has gone gold and has been 
perched on the national charts for almost a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a different kind of humor," says Jerky Boy Johnny B., "and our success 
on the charts shocked us at first. But you look at some of the music on the 
charts, and it's not such a shock."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: KEEPING '60 MINUTES' TICKING; TELEVISION: 
JOURNALIST-DETECTIVES SUCH AS LOWELL BERGMAN ARE THE FOUNDATION OF NETWORK 
NEWSMAGAZINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the screen was Mike Wallace of "60 Minutes," the biggest of the big stars 
on the biggest, most profitable CBS series of them all. 
</P>
<P>
 There he was in his protective vest one Sunday last September, inside 
maximum-security Pelican Bay, California's controversial high-tech dungeon that 
houses the worst of the state's bad apples, asking tough questions about 
alleged inhumane treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 There he was last November, on a story about the CIA's reported involvement in 
the smuggling of cocaine into this nation as part of an undercover operation it 
undertook without the knowledge of any U.S. law enforcement agency. 
</P>
<P>
 There he was again last month, a laser of aggression in dangerous south 
Beirut, mincing no words with those blamed by the U.S. government for some of 
the worst anti-American terrorism in recent history. There he was, in the heart 
of Hezbollah country, telling Sheik Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah: 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans believe that you -- as an Islamic fundamentalist -- that you are a 
leader that contributed to the bombing of the U.S. embassy, the killing of the 
241 Marines, the plane hijackings and the taking of the hostages." 
</P>
<P>
 There he was, arguably the most recognizable reporter in the United States, 
affixing his big, looping journalistic signature to some of the best and 
highest-profile investigative stories "60 Minutes" had to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Great work . . . Lowell. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowell ? 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, for the man behind those stories and many others that Wallace 
does is Lowell Bergman, 48. Unsung, unheard, unseen Lowell Bergman. Well, 
nearly unseen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sort of like Alfred Hitchcock," Bergman said recently, citing the 
legendary director who liked to make fleeting appearances as an extra in his 
films. "If you looked closely in the Beirut piece, there I am among the 
faithful -- probably the first and last Jew to do this -- being frisked on the 
way into a mosque." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of being a director, though, Bergman is a field producer, a sort of 
"60 Minutes" West as he operates mainly from his Bay Area home in Berkeley 
Hills. As co-founder of the highly regarded Center for Investigative Reporting 
in San Francisco, he's one of TV's top journalist-detectives. He's a shrewd, 
talented blue chipper among the blue-collar reporters who for years have 
anonymously underpinned television newscasts and magazine programs, doing much 
of the work while remaining faceless as others bask in the glow of the stories 
that go on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 In his autobiography, Wallace himself lauds some of those who have labored 
off-camera for "60 Minutes." For the most part, though, it's television's dirty 
little secret that the people in news who toil the hardest are generally the 
ones who are least known and least paid. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, some equate the relationship between correspondent and producer as 
that of a dog and a fire hydrant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public," "60 Minutes" producer Joe DeCola once said, "thinks the 
correspondent has done all the running around, interviewed all the people, read 
all the government reports, spent hours on the phone. Wrong. It's the producer 
who's done all that." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only on the network level. "I probably do 80 to 90% of everything," says a 
field producer who's done investigative series at several local stations. "Most 
reporters don't get involved until it gets on the air. You basically have a 
news reader who delivers what you researched." 
</P>
<P>
 As vividly affirmed by Diane Sawyer's new ABC contract, estimated to pay $5 
million to $6 million a year, the business nourishes -- and is nourished by -- 
a star system. Although she's smart and has had posh assignments at ABC and 
CBS, where she once co-starred on "60 Minutes," Sawyer is infinitely less 
valuable as a journalist than as a charismatic personality and human trademark. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no box-office slouch himself, interviewer deluxe Wallace is a 
different case. Bergman is awed by the 75-year-old Wallace's drive and says 
he's the most actively involved of the correspondents he's worked with in 11 
years at "60 Minutes" or at ABC's "20/20," where Bergman began on TV after 
working for alternative newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 As Wallace himself acknowledged recently, though, "most of the reporting on a 
given piece is done by the producer and the researchers. How the dickens could 
you possibly turn out 25 to 30 stories a year by yourself? We, the 
correspondents, are like co-producers." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergman is "one of the best reporters I've ever come across, plain and 
simple," Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Few reporters have better contacts in certain areas like police, crime and 
terrorism," added "60 Minutes" creator and executive producer Don Hewitt. "He's 
plugged into elements of our society that other reporters just guess at." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it was Hewitt who titled that recent terrorism story "Three Days in 
Beirut," Bergman said, because "Mike was there three days." Bergman was there 
seven days.  
</P>
<P>
 Its enduring popularity proves that no program is more influential or tells 
and sells a story better than "60 Minutes." Like TV news most everywhere in the 
United States, however, the largest names on its marquee are its own celebrity 
journalists, who themselves are the chief storytellers. "It's become part of 
the grammar in which Americans watch television, and apparently it works," 
Bergman says.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of their varying journalistic skills, Wallace, Morley Safer, Ed 
Bradley, Lesley Stahl and Steve Kroft attract an audience largely through their 
personas -- carefully crafted personas as solo flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's terrible," bristled veteran "60 Minutes" senior producer Phil Scheffler. 
"The system around here is to perpetuate the myth that the people you see on 
the air on '60 Minutes' are the people who do the work. They do the work, but 
they don't do all the work." Their many collaborators "are not given the public 
credit they deserve," Scheffler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hewitt said he takes "no issue" with that. "It's the nature of the beast, and 
I wish there was a way to change it. We have five correspondents and 22 
producers. Thus we have 27 reporters. Five of them get to broadcast because 
they talk better than the others." 
</P>
<P>
 To its credit, "60 Minutes" was the first network news program to regularly 
list the names of field producers with stories. Yet few viewers are aware of 
the critical roles these producers play. And that information gap wasn't 
narrowed when they were virtually excluded from a recent two-hour CBS program 
celebrating the 25th birthday of "60 Minutes" and, correspondingly, the roles 
of Hewitt, his big-name correspondents and Andy Rooney.  
</P>
<P>
 Bergman's own career as a field producer has not been without frustration. He 
mentions no names, but. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bad when you're working with someone who can't interview on camera. I've 
even gotten on my hands and knees and crawled across the floor behind the 
correspondent -- so that the person being questioned maintains eye contact in 
the direction of the interviewer -- and asked questions we needed answers to. 
Otherwise we wouldn't have had a story." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergman is almost euphoric, though, about the "incredible collaborative 
effort" behind the Beirut story, from Wallace's reporting and interviewing to 
Debbie DeLuca's associate producing to Tony Baldo's editing to Ray Briebiesca's 
camera work. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergman: "Jim Hougan, an old friend of mine who's writing a book about Beirut 
in the 1980s and the intelligence wars, said he could set it up for us to 
interview these people from Hezbollah, the party of God. I asked Mike if he was 
interested, and he said, 'Oh, sure.' The government told Mike we shouldn't go 
because we'd all be taken hostages, but we went in." 
</P>
<P>
 After getting Hewitt's approval, of course, he and members of the crew moved 
35 cases of equipment from New York to Beirut, where they rendezvoused with two 
Arabic-speaking free-lance TV crewmen from Athens. "I've worked with them 
before in Jordan and on the Iraqi border," Bergman said. "They do things that 
save your life." 
</P>
<P>
 Although granted armed escorts by local authorities, the crew's timing was 
critical because the story would implicate Syrian President Hafez Assad in acts 
of terrorism. "There was some risk to our lives," Bergman said. "We knew that 
the Syrians control Lebanon, and that the Hezbollah can only exist with the 
assent of Assad, and that he was going to meet Clinton in Geneva on Jan. 16. So 
we felt we were safe until the 16th because the Syrians wouldn't want to screw 
up their summit." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace arrived in Beirut Jan. 9, completed his interviews in two days, then 
flew with Bergman to London, and the next morning both flew on to New York. On 
Jan. 16, "Three Days in Beirut" led "60 Minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Does Bergman ever yearn for more recognition? "Oh, sure," he said. "As I grow 
older, the desire to get more credit has grown. Part of it has to do with being 
more honest about the process. But as Hewitt says, 'Do you know a better way to 
do it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 So, on the screen is Mike Wallace. . . .

SCR OFFICIAL TAKES JOB IN SANTA CRUZ; THEATER: ASSOCIATE PRODUCER PAUL HAMMOND 
WILL JOIN A SMALLER SHAKESPEARE COMPANY. STAFF REALIGNMENTS IN COSTA MESA ARE 
EXPECTED NEXT WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 South Coast Repertory has lost one of its top executives to a theater company 
in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 13 months after becoming SCR associate producer, Paul Hammond has been 
named managing director of Shakespeare Santa Cruz, a much smaller troupe. The 
appointment is to take effect March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond, 38, said Tuesday that his departure is amicable and that he is being 
lured away "by the chance to live in Northern California. Wouldn't you move 
there if you had the chance?"  
</P>
<P>
 He first came to SCR in 1980 as a part-time production secretary. As associate 
producer he oversees the day-to-day operations of Orange County's largest 
professional theater with general manager Paula Tomei. He also has 
responsibility for development and fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond was elevated to his post from director of theater operations in 
January, 1993, as part of a reorganization of SCR's top management designed to 
relieve co-founders David Emmes and Martin Benson of most of their business 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SCR is expected to announce staff realignments March 1. According to a 
spokesman, Tomei will be named to the new position of managing director, and a 
general manager will be hired. Emmes and Benson could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This opportunity came out of the blue for me," Hammond said. "I was not 
actively looking for a job. Shakespeare Santa Cruz was conducting an executive 
search and apparently my name was submitted to them by a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "But my wife and I have been talking for a number of years about moving to 
Northern California. We have three children, and we'd like to have a different 
environment to raise them in."  
</P>
<P>
 Shakespeare Santa Cruz, a not-for-profit company associated with UC Santa 
Cruz, has an annual operating budget of slightly more than $1 million, Hammond 
said. SCR has a budget of $5.8 million.

THE ROOM WHERE THE INDUSTRY UNSPOOLS ITS FILMS; MOVIES: CHARLES AIDIKOFF'S 
PRIVATE SCREENING ROOM EMBODIES THREE GENERATIONS OF PROJECTIONISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By QUENDRITH JOHNSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles Aidikoff is an unusual screen legend. He's no star. Certainly not an 
agent. He's not even an assistant producer. But Aidikoff has been projecting a 
clear image in the entertainment industry for nearly 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
 So maybe it's more appropriate to call him a screening legend. 
</P>
<P>
 The 79-year-old former New Yorker is a projectionist who founded the Charles 
Aidikoff screening room, a private screening room-for-hire, in 1966, back when 
most major studios had their own facilities but independent producers had to 
hunt around to find a place to showcase their cinematic wares. But even more 
compelling is the fact that the Aidikoff family has become something of a 
projectionist dynasty -- Charles' father, Max, was an old-time projectionist 
for RKO in New York City in the early part of this century, and his son, Gregg, 
37, is poised to be the third generation carrying on the singular Hollywood 
craft. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started out," Charles Aidikoff says, "the thrill was being able 
to see all the films that were coming out. After that I looked forward to 
meeting the celebrities when they came into my room. And the thrill hasn't 
gone, because every day is different. I'll never lose that feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 For 26 years, the Charles Aidikoff Screening Room was at Sunset and Doheny. 
Both majors and minors, studios and independent filmmakers, unspooled their 
finest features under Aidikoff's roof: "Five Easy Pieces," "A Clockwork 
Orange," "Star Wars," "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial," "Apocalypse Now" and even 
the Italian food-orgy film "La Grande Bouffe." 
</P>
<P>
 During that time virtual unknowns as well as such pillars of the industry as 
Marlon Brando, Gregory Peck, Charlton Heston and Kirk Douglas sat in Aidikoff's 
26 cushy chairs, ate cookies and watched their movies on this big screen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beatles dropped by in 1972 to catch a movie by the late Harry Nilsson. 
Mick Jagger strolled in one night, as did Elton John and members of Yes, the 
Who and the Grateful Dead. "Madonna was in a few times when she was married to 
Sean Penn," Aidikoff says. "Candice Bergen, a very nice lady." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago Aidikoff moved to his bigger location at 150 S. Rodeo Drive in 
Beverly Hills, a swank high-tech facility that seats 53. So far, the stardust 
bookings have followed him.  
</P>
<P>
 But that's not to say there aren't some complaints. Russell Schwartz, 
president of Gramercy Pictures, likes the cutting-edge venue but objects to the 
lurking presence of white sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've sort of been a patron of Aidikoff's for about 10 years," Schwartz says. 
"It's always nice to hear a tale or two from Charles while you're waiting for a 
screening. The only bone I have to pick with him is about those Oreos -- he 
should have some honey-sweetened cookies." 
</P>
<P>
 New Line Cinema's president of marketing and distribution, Mitch Goldman, says 
that of the dozen or so other private facilities in the area, Aidikoff's is the 
richest in Hollywood lore, "but," he adds, "whether that enters into our doing 
more business with him than not, I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
 Aidikoff now shares the business with son Gregg, whom he "trained from the 
ground up," beginning when the boy was about 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Movies) were a window that went from reality to unreality," the younger 
Aidikoff explains. "I think I saw maybe 2,000 films before I was 20 years old. 
One of the first looks of (naked) women I ever had was on the screen." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 While his adolescence was influenced by Stanley Kubrick and Francis Ford 
Coppola, on the technical side, Gregg actually learned everything about 
throwing an image from his dad. Charles Aidikoff, in turn, says that he learned 
everything he knew from his father, Max -- working in New York from the 
mid-'30s until 1955, when he left New York for L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost more fun to run the film than to watch the movies, " says Gregg, 
who now handles all the projectionist duties since his father developed eye 
problems last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond operating the focus device and making sure the film is threaded 
perfectly so the image is centered on the screen, Charles Aidikoff says he has 
tried to instill in his son the importance of maintaining the dynasty. Gregg 
describes his own son, Joshua, 10, as a "possible" fourth-generation 
projectionist who loves movies, especially last year's "Rudy." 
</P>
<P>
 Gregg Aidikoff is poised to expand the job of projectionist beyond the 
projection booth. With the new screening room -- with its 5,000-watt digital 
sound system, satellite dish on the roof and "two walls floating on rubber with 
a 4-inch air gap" for noise reduction -- he hopes to cater to TV, music and 
corporate interests in addition to the film industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Rental fees for weekdays begin at $350 for two hours and up; weekends are 
higher. There's also a reception room for private parties. In addition, Gregg 
plans to franchise the Charles Aidikoff Screening Room name, opening other 
Charles Aidikoff facilities around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Such heady plans, however, don't take the place of Hollywood's lost history. 
Aidikoff pe re , for one, longs for the time when "movie people were Movie 
People." 
</P>
<P>
 "In my old days, I used to have stars. I worked for RKO, also at the Warner 
Bros. studio out in Brooklyn," he says. "Marlene Dietrich would come in and sit 
there with me. I said, 'Miss Dietrich, I am sorry, you have the most beautiful 
gams in the world. I can't take my eyes off them.' Orson Welles did his last 
film in my screening room." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, he complains, the proportion of "lousy" to "good" films is about 
10-to-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those lousy films pay our bills, Dad," his son admonishes.  
</P>
<P>
 "You're right," Aidikoff says. "We don't want to alienate the lousy 
filmmakers."

STEINMAN TAKES BOW FOR 'BAT II'; POP MUSIC: SURE, IT'S MEAT LOAF'S NAME IN BIG 
TYPE. BUT WHO WRITES AND PRODUCES THE SONGS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.D. CONSIDINE, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Steinman seems perfectly cast as a rock 'n' roll eminence grise. He's 
definitely a man with a vision -- a complete package of sound, image and 
mystique -- but it's one fashioned for and performed by others. Consequently, 
Steinman's biggest successes as a songwriter and producer invariably have 
someone else's name up in lights, while his moniker is relegated to the fine 
print and album credits. 
</P>
<P>
 Others might find that situation horribly frustrating, but Steinman, in 
classic man-behind-the-scenes fashion, merely chuckles. His latest success, 
"Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell," on MCA Records, may have Meat Loaf's name 
writ large on the album cover, but that hardly matters to Steinman. "I think of 
it as my album, starring Meat Loaf," he says over the phone from New York. "I 
mean, to me, it was like the Who -- he was Roger Daltrey, I was Peter Townshend 
-- except we didn't have the band name." 
</P>
<P>
 The first "Bat Out of Hell" album (produced by Todd Rundgren, with all the 
songs written by Steinman) was actually only a moderate success upon its 
release in 1977, peaking at No. 14 on the Billboard album chart, but Steinman 
knew that it continued to sell steadily over the years -- in fact, it just 
crossed the 9 million mark. So when the opportunity rose to work with Meat Loaf 
again, Steinman leaped at the chance, convinced that the combination still had 
a certain magic in the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Others were not so sure. "It felt right to me," Steinman says. "I was fairly 
cocky making this record. But I know at MCA, they were talking about 'Spinal 
Tap II.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, such fears were groundless. "Bat Out of Hell II" was an 
immediate smash, topping the album charts and so far delivering two hit 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, Meat Loaf got nearly all of the attention. But despite all the 
stories heralding Meat Loaf's comeback, Steinman points out that the singer 
actually released eight albums while between bats. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were terrible," he says. "It can't be easy for Meat to know he put out 
all those records and they didn't work, because at some level he's going to 
feel, 'What -- do I have to have Steinman with me?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not, but there's definitely a certain chemistry between the two. "In one 
sense, we actually do love each other, because we were created for each other," 
says Steinman, who produced as well as wrote the new album. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there's a very uneasy truce. (On the tour for the first album) he would 
have huge tantrums about, 'I'm not the Frankenstein monster,' because people 
would say that I was Dr. Frankenstein and he was the Frankenstein monster. I 
would have to soothe him and say, 'No, no -- you're Marlon Brando and I'm 
Francis Coppola.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, Steinman has not been a part of Meat Loaf's road show. "I go and 
join it every now and then," he says. "I did a song with him at Madison Square 
Garden, I did a couple of songs in Toronto at Maple Leafs Garden. I go in and 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "He really sees (touring) as his domain," Steinman adds. "I'm interpreting, 
but I'm pretty sure he thinks that my world is the studio, where he's pretty 
much subjugated, and his is the stage, and I should surrender to that. And I 
guess I have to respect that."
