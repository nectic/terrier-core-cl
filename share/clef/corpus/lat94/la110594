 ELECTION FEVER? Officials have tallied the final count on the number of 
registered voters for Tuesday's election: It's slightly higher than for the 
June primary, but below the 1992 fall numbers. Republicans are still well ahead 
of Democrats, by more than 200,000. . . . Where do all these voters live? 
Anaheim has the most, at 103,959. Huntington Beach is second at 103,363. And 
Santa Ana is No. 3 at 70,219.

 SOURCE OF PAIN: The struggles of black football players is the subject of 
Sunday's "This Is the NFL" (Channel 11, 8:30 a.m.). The program notes that the 
Los Angeles Rams broke the color barrier in 1946 when Kenny Washington joined 
the team. . . . One poignant moment comes from Hall of Famer and current Rams 
broadcaster Deacon Jones: "Humiliation is walking past five upscale white 
schools and going to the little, old, black two-room shack down the street . . 
. They made you believe you were less than a man. So, you're constantly trying 
to prove yourself."

 ECUMENICAL MISSION: Catholics founded Mission San Juan Capistrano. But today, 
the Catholic mission hosts 500 people from different religions for a diversity 
fair. It begins with a Jewish Sabbath Service. Workshops on Hindu, Buddhist, 
Bahai, Catholic and Protestant faiths will be offered. Preregistration interest 
was high for Islam and Muslims sessions. . . . Says mission administrator 
Gerald J. Miller: "If you wanted to know about them, where else would you go?"

 MUSEUM BLUES: Most of the blues at art museums are in the hues of the artists' 
visions hanging on the walls. But tonight at the Fullerton Museum Center -- 
which emphasizes that it's more than an art museum -- there will be the blues 
you can tap your foot to. . . . Harmonica Fats and the Bernie Pearl Blues Band 
will play a sold-out gig in its auditorium. Says curator Lynn LaBat: "We do 
these things to draw people to see the museum, but we also want to add cultural 
value to the community." Final Tally

DENNIS C. OTT; ACTOR BECAME ACTIVIST AFTER CONTRACTING AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dennis C. Ott, a promising character actor who at 6 feet, 11 inches, became a 
towering Klingon in a "Star Trek" film and a menacing devil in the light comedy 
"Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey," died Thursday at his home in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 A family spokesman said the actor was 36 and died of complications of AIDS, 
diagnosed in 1990 when his career was beginning to blossom.The virus was 
discovered when Ott tried to donate blood to the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 Ott did not hide his illness. He gave interviews, spoke about the disease at 
high schools and marched in AIDS walks. 
</P>
<P>
 He unknowingly passed the virus to his wife, Louise. He said he contracted the 
disease during a relationship with a TV actress in the mid-1980s. She died 
months before he was diagnosed and he did not learn that she had AIDS until 
shortly before her death. 
</P>
<P>
 Ott was employed as a corrections officer in the Philadelphia prison system 
when stage director John Flynn spotted him on the boardwalk in Wildwood, N.J., 
in 1982 and cast him in a bit part.  
</P>
<P>
 Besides his roles as a Klingon in "Star Trek III: The Search for Spock" and as 
an alien in "Star Trek IV: The Undiscovered Country," Ott portrayed a looter in 
"Police Academy 6" and also had a small part in the film "The Doors."

DONN ARDEN, 78; CREATED THE VEGAS SHOWGIRL EXTRAVAGANZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Donn Arden, a major-domo of nightclub musicals whose name has appeared on 
marquees around the world and whose "Jubilee!" continues to play 13 years after 
it opened in Las Vegas, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 Arden, a onetime vaudeville hoofer who as a youth shared a Charleston contest 
crown with Ginger Rogers, was 78 and died Wednesday at his home in Palm 
Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Arden, whose specialty was statuesque, skimpily-clad girls posing among the 
ruins of a mock Titanic or the re-created wreck of a quake-devastated San 
Francisco, had been one of Las Vegas' top entrepreneurs since 1950, when he 
staged the first showgirl extravaganza at the Desert Inn. 
</P>
<P>
 His ambitions were such that at one time he had wanted to stage the burning of 
Atlanta from "Gone With the Wind" but could not get permission from author 
Margaret Mitchell's estate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm famous," he told The Times in 1988, "for beautiful girls and major 
disasters." 
</P>
<P>
 Arden's other Las Vegas credits included Lido de Paris -- the first topless 
show in a Las Vegas clubroom -- at the Stardust, said Tom Bruny, an MGM Grand 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "He produced three shows for the MGM Grand," Bruny said. " 'Hallelujah 
Hollywood' opened in 1973 at the original Grand, 'Hello Hollywood Hello' opened 
at the MGM in Reno in 1978, and in 1981 he opened 'Jubilee' at the original MGM 
(in Las Vegas, now Bally's)." 
</P>
<P>
 Arden was Don Arden when he began tap-dancing at speak-easies around St. 
Louis, where he was born (he added the second "n" to his first name for 
theatrical purposes). After studying with Robert Alton -- later to become a 
well-known film choreographer -- he teamed with two sets of chorus-girl twins 
and became "Donn Arden and the Artists Models," which evolved into a favorite 
at vaudeville houses nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 But he tired of travel and conceived of a permanent revue featuring a larger 
chorus line that would stay in one theater. 
</P>
<P>
 By the mid-1930s the single revue had grown to several, which performed in 
nightclubs from New York to Los Angeles for several months at a stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Arden produced shows for GIs during World War II and afterward provided 
dancers and choreography for shows featuring Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sophie 
Tucker and others. 
</P>
<P>
 His first large-scale, independent production came in 1948 when the new owners 
of the Lido in Paris brought him to France. That success led him to the Nevada 
desert. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to working with his usual coterie of dancing beauties, Arden 
brought to Las Vegas specialty acts he had seen in European circuses, among 
them Siegfried and Roy. 
</P>
<P>
 He refused to have dinner shows at his revues ("My dancers deserve more 
respect than that") and won the admiration of hotel owners by replacing 
expensive headliners with his comparatively inexpensive ensemble dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Donn's qualifications were very rigid," said Jeanie Malone, a former Desert 
Inn showgirl who, with many other dancers, stayed with the choreographer for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted the girls to be good-looking. You didn't necessarily have to be a 
great dancer, because he could make you look great, but you had to be a lady 
and you had to dress well," she said.

PETER TAYLOR; NOVELIST WON PULITZER PRIZE IN 1987 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter Taylor, a Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist in the tradition of William 
Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor whose stories poignantly chronicled the slow 
disappearance of the Southern aristocracy, is dead at age 77. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor died of pneumonia Wednesday night at the University of Virginia 
Hospital.He had suffered a series of strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 He won the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for "A Summons to Memphis," about a man called 
home by his sisters to stop their widowed father from remarrying. It was 
Taylor's first novel in nearly 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, Taylor was known as a short-story writer whose collections never 
sold more than a few thousand copies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I write not because I want to, but because I have to," he said in an 
interview after winning the Pulitzer at age 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor's latest novel, "In the Tennessee Country," was praised by critics when 
it was published in September. It tells the melancholy story of a man looking 
back on his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor published his first book in 1948, "A Long Fourth and Other Stories." 
</P>
<P>
 His stories included elaborate descriptions of the well-heeled world of the 
Southern gentry in Nashville, Memphis and other cities. Many of his characters 
struggle to adjust to the end of the lush lifestyles of their childhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Writer Joyce Carol Oates called "The Collected Stories of Peter Taylor," 
published in 1969, "one of the major works of our literature." 
</P>
<P>
 "Summons to Memphis" also won the $50,000 Ritz Paris Hemingway literary prize 
in 1987. Taylor was the first author writing in English to win the prize.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; SHOWING HIS SOUL AND HIS INSPIRATION; ERIC CLAPTON BRINGS 
FEELINGS OF COMFORT AND CONVICTION TO HIS ALL-BLUES CONCERT AT THE FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It took nearly 30 years, but when Eric Clapton casually sauntered on stage at 
the Forum on Thursday, picked up an acoustic 12-string and started strumming 
the old blues number "Motherless Child," he looked as if he'd finally come 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 In a concert devoted to blues songs, as is his new album, "From the Cradle," 
the Englishman seemed more comfortable and passionate on stage than at any time 
in memory. No small achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 In past shows, Clapton has often looked distinctly un comfortable in the 
spotlight -- as if unworthy of the task of trying to communicate the deep 
emotions of his music and the blues greats that inspired him. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thursday, dressed in a white T-shirt and baggy pants, and with 
close-cropped hair and round glasses, he was a Zen blues master, ripping out 
guitar licks with celestial thunder and grace, and singing the words of great 
blues gods with soulful conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a night of "songs that spell out what it all is for me, and caused me 
to be what I am, whatever that is," he told the capacity audience early in the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, as a prodigal guitarist in the mid-'60s, Clapton quit the Yardbirds 
because that band was turning too "pop," and embarked on a quest for blues 
purity. Often through the years, though, it seemed that Clapton was wandering 
in the desert. For every "Layla" or "Bell Bottom Blues," songs that came from 
deep in his soul, there was a "Pretending" or some other empty mainstream 
shell. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no pretending on Thursday. The music Clapton played -- two hours of 
nuggets associated with the likes of Muddy Waters, Elmore James and other 
greats of the Delta/Chicago axis -- was the music that courses through his 
veins. 
</P>
<P>
 Clapton paced the show well as a primer in blues styles, starting with the 
acoustic basics (resembling his Grammy-winning 1992 "Unplugged" session). As 
the show progressed, he and his band (which features veteran blues-rock pianist 
Chris Stainton and harmonica ace Jerry Portnoy), electrified the set, 
culminating with horn-spiked urban blues. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with his impressive history in mind, the depth and facility Clapton 
showed on a wide variety of songs were remarkable. He grabbed the soul nuances 
of Lowell Fulson's "Sinner's Prayer," the macho boasts of Willie Dixon's 
"Hoochie Coochie Man" and, of course, the fiery, crowd-rousing guitar lines of 
Freddie King's "Someday After a While." 
</P>
<P>
 The flow and impact could have been boosted if Clapton had given more 
illuminating introductions to the songs, maybe revealing where he was when he 
first heard some of the songs or some other insight.  
</P>
<P>
 But the heart conveyed in the performances transcended any sense that he was 
merely trying to teach his fans about the blues -- a mean trick in a cavernous 
arena. Imagine what it will be like in next week's House of Blues shows. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eric Clapton will give blues-only concerts Nov. 11, 12 and 13 at the House 
of Blues, 8439 Sunset Blvd., 8:30 p.m. Tickets are $30 and are available only 
through Ticketmaster's phone service.

POP NOTES: CLINT BLACK: WITH 'EMOTION' IN NEWPORT

 Country music star Clint Black stops at the Wherehouse in Newport Beach for a 
meet-and-greet session to promote his new album, "One Emotion," today from 2 to 
4 p.m. The store is at Fashion Island, 453 Newport Center Drive. (714) 
644-6993.  
</P>
<P>
 Also rising in the country universe, albeit still on a somewhat less lofty 
level than the platinum-selling Black, is Stanley Wycoff, the decidedly skewed 
auteur of the progressive-country studio band Bierce in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Wycoff, who lives in Long Beach and records for the Seal Beach-based Rococo 
Records, was the subject of an Oct. 26 spot on the national cable broadcast TNN 
Country News. 
</P>
<P>
 With sidekick Chris Gaffney beside him, Wycoff expounded upon the "bleak, 
dismal view of the world" that emerges on his deliciously sour new album, "Vale 
of Tears." The segment also featured snippets of two Bierce in L.A. videos, "Ax 
Murderers" and "Do Some Don'ts."

 NO FEAR: Bazooka shows it isn't superstitious by planning two performances on 
the 13th of this month -- an in-store show at 2 p.m. at the Tower Lab in Costa 
Mesa, and a 10 p.m. nightcap (with Standard Fruit) at the Firecracker Lounge in 
Anaheim. The jazzily improvisational, avant-rock trio's second album, 
"Blowhole," has just been released on SST. . . . Greg Jacobs, the San 
Diego-based band manager who got his start in the rock business booking shows 
for Big Drill Car, has compiled a 146-page paperback of indie-rock bands' 
brief, in-their-own-words accounts of exploits and mishaps on the low-budget 
touring circuit. Titled "Hell on Wheels," it includes tales of the road from 36 
bands, including X, L7, King Missile, Minutemen and the Germs. Tales of 
hardship and misery from Orange County rockers Frank Daly of Big Drill Car and 
Mike (Gabby) Gaborno of Cadillac Tramps are among the road stories included in 
the collection, which is published by Rockpress, P.O. Box 99090, San Diego, 
Calif. 92169, (619) 234-9400. . . . Rounder Records has reissued "Lady's 
Fancy," a 1977 solo album by Fullerton folk-guitar hero Dan Crary.

 Ms. Smith Goes to Washington: Actress-playwright Anna Deavere Smith, whose 
last one-woman show chronicled the Los Angeles riots and their aftermath, has 
begun a six-month residency at Washington's Arena Stage to develop a new 
performance piece exploring the image of the American presidency as created by 
the White House press corps. "On the Road: The Search for American Character" 
will also delve into the effect of the presidency's image on the national 
character. As part of her research, Smith plans to spend time with the White 
House press corps to get a first-hand look at whether the press simply reports 
a President's words and deeds or if it uses a "spin" to aggressively shape the 
public's perception. PEOPLE WATCH

 Rourke KO's Furniture: Looks like Hollywood actor and sometime boxer Mickey 
Rourke wins the celebrity room-trashing sweepstakes. Rourke's total at New 
York's posh Plaza Hotel was $20,000, said owner Donald Trump, noting that the 
$5,000-a-night suite was so damaged Thursday that it had to be closed to guests 
for repairs. A source in Trump's office said Rourke was banned from the Plaza 
for life. No charges were filed, but Rourke should expect a bill. Rourke had 
been staying at the hotel for about three weeks, and was seen this week at the 
city's fashion shows, where his former wife, actress and model Carre Otis, is 
appearing on the runways. Earlier this year, Rourke pleaded not guilty to 
charges of spousal abuse after allegedly striking Otis in Los Angeles.

 Bashing His Own Job: It appears that Branford Marsalis' upcoming indefinite 
leave of absence from the "Tonight Show" is not as amicable as originally 
reported. In the upcoming issue of BAM magazine, the bandleader and saxophonist 
says the job is "not my idea of wonderful musical creativity. We play the music 
exactly the way (the producers) want, but we're laughing the whole time." 
Marsalis also says that his on-screen chemistry with Jay Leno will never rival 
David Letterman and Paul Shaffer's because "I'm not the kind of person that's 
gonna kiss Jay's ass and say everything he does is right." TELEVISION

 Howard Rosenberg's column " 'News- Hour' Chases the News, Not Simpson" (Oct. 
26) was right on. As a former news freak, I used to watch several hours of 
local news a day -- but no more! To get the small amount of news dispensed 
between the mountains of idiotic, ridiculous hype on the Rodney King beating, 
the Menendez trial and now the Simpson trial is simply not worth the 
aggravation.Give me "MacNeil/Lehrer" or CNN any time.

 I congratulate Howard Rosenberg for recognizing "The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour." 
Within a few months of my 1978 migration to the United States, I began feeling 
nauseated by the news "shows" of network television. They seemed to lack 
truthfulness, objectivity and courtesy -- the staples of true journalism. They 
were nothing but a forum for silky-tongued, well-dressed and glamorous folks to 
drum up business for their sponsors and to increase their personal popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually I discovered "The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour." Now I have made it my 
primary source of news, along with a few newspapers. "NewsHour" strives to 
probe and clarify the viewpoint of its guests. And it does so with dignity and 
courtesy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen years ago, I was amazed by the extent of freedom accorded to the press 
in the United States. But, having watched the network and cable news, I 
realized that the freedom does not necessarily guarantee quality. Network and 
cable journalism, with divided loyalties and dubious ethics, is no better than 
a policed newspaper in a totalitarian society. 
</P>
<P>
 But I am glad that we do have "MacNeil/Lehrer" as a choice on television. I 
strongly urge your readers to give the "NewsHour" a try.

THE VOICE OF RAUL JULIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's ironic that not long after the results of surveys demonstrating lack of 
Latin representation in the show business world, we lost Raul Julia.His career 
was short in comparison to fellow thespian Burt Lancaster, but Julia was young 
and he had such potential. He had a great talent, and I'm grateful. 
</P>
<P>
 I personally enjoyed his voice. One evening in summer I was zapping through my 
remote and came across a documentary on political unrest, but the narrator of 
the program -- the voice sounded so familiar. His voice had a charming 
resonance. Although that voice is silent now, it was heard long enough to leave 
a solid mark.

THE TALENTS IN 'SEAGULL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I must take issue with Laurie Winer's review of "The Seagull," now playing at 
the Matrix Theatre, insofar as its treatment and, in the case of Robert 
Foxworth no treatment at all, of the actors ("Chekhov's 'Seagull' Wings It 
Among Multiple Casts at Matrix," Oct. 31). They seem to be characterized as "TV 
actors," as if that were a species of performer not worthy of the boards. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sure I understand these categories, but I do know that this company 
embodies many of the best actors in and of American theater. I have worked with 
them on Broadway, in regional theaters and at my own theater, and I would be 
proud to have this company and their Chekhovian characters on my stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matrix is a labor of love that springs forth from a gifted group of 
actors. All's fair in love and criticism, for sure, but a drop of respect for 
these actors might help keep this much-needed experience alive.

THE AGE OF THE STONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Puffery and a Bit of Intriguing Irascibility in 'Rolling Stones.' " (Oct. 
27): Every time I read anything about the Rolling Stones and/or Mick Jagger, 
the subject of age is brought up, either the age of the band or the age of the 
fans. Then there is a comment on how this seems to disgust Mick Jagger. 
</P>
<P>
 I find the Rolling Stones' message inspiring -- do what you love as long as 
you can. The latest Stones concert was the best concert I've ever been to, with 
artists performing for people of all ages who were loving the performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank goodness they haven't quit; we would have missed a lot of fun and 
entertainment. I don't blame Jagger for being sick of comments about age. It 
should be irrelevant. True art transcends age, race or nationality, and the 
Stones have proved that they are true artists.

'PULP FICTION' RETURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Interestingly, Lisa Koontz ("What's So Funny About 'Pulp Fiction'?," Saturday 
Letters, Oct. 29) took notice of the faces of fellow patrons exiting the 
theater after a showing of the movie, which leads me to believe she allowed 
herself to "endure" 2 1/2 hours of "senseless violence." The opening 10 minutes 
of this movie clearly set the tone, certainly enough time for her to have 
requested a refund. 
</P>
<P>
 So why are we laughing, Lisa? Perhaps if you'll allow yourself to "lighten up" 
a little, you'll have the answer. 
</P>

<P>
 Maybe I can clarify for Koontz part of what we find appealing about "Pulp 
Fiction" (and others of its ilk). There is tremendous appeal in being able to 
see the senseless violence in a controlled arena, combined with clever 
dialogue, performed by talented, engaging actors -- rather than in the 
frightening randomness of real life, perpetrated by ignorant, angry people. 
</P>
<P>
 If we don't laugh, we will all begin to cry, or be afraid to leave our homes. 
And I hate to break it to Koontz, but the violence already has spread to the 
suburbs -- or maybe she hasn't heard about the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson 
and Ronald Goldman.

THE ANTI-SCIENCE MESSAGE IN THE MEDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Jurassic Park" has hit the video stores and, as a university research 
scientist and teacher, I feel it is appropriate to take a moment to point out 
the violently anti-science and anti-scientist message of this ongoing 
mega-media event. Here we have a group of scientists who have learned to 
regenerate organisms from fragments of their chromosomes -- not even intact 
cells are required. 
</P>
<P>
 What do these people choose to do with this amazing technology? Do they want 
to cure cancer? No. Do they want to grow organs or limbs to help victims of 
illness or war? No. Do they want to develop disease-resistant wheat or corn 
that can be irrigated with seawater? No. These people want to grow dinosaurs 
for a gigantic theme park. Am I the only person who thinks this is sick? 
</P>
<P>
 But what we really have here is the same old anti-science anti-technology 
Hollywood theme. These are nothing more than the old-time, classic "mad 
scientists." Dr. Frankenstein would have been proud. I would like to ask Steven 
Spielberg and his colleagues to give us a break. Scientists develop the 
technology, but it is society that ultimately controls the applications. With 
the notable exception of the late Gene Roddenberry, Hollywood continues to 
treat scientists with fear and loathing while exploiting the wonders of 
technology for a cheap thrill.

PHILHARMONIC'S RETURN

<TEXT>
<P>
 I was very pleased by Martin Bernheimer's "Triumphant Opener for Salonen, 
Philharmonic" (Oct. 8).It is good to know that the Los Angeles Philharmonic 
Orchestra is back in town and ready for the next season. Being Slavic myself, 
and knowing the pieces that Music Director Esa-Pekka Salonen has chosen, makes 
me feel I have missed a great deal of excitement. I could hear the music just 
by reading the description of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 I am looking forward to this music season, and I hope I will be able to see 
some of the concerts. Thank you for letting me know.

THE STRONGMAN: STEEL ARMS, WARM HEART; PERFORMANCE: ACTION-FILM ACTOR RICK 
ZUMWALT BRINGS HIS FEATS OF STRENGTH TO CIRQUE DU SOLEIL AT THE SANTA MONICA 
PIER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE LACHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rick Zumwalt, Cirque du Soleil's first strongman, is what you might call a 
minimalist. His professional photo lists, "Height: tall, weight: heavy." 
</P>
<P>
 If you insist on numbers, how about these?: He's 6 foot 4 inches tall, down to 
a "slim-trim" 310 pounds, and his chest is 5 feet around, his biceps, 2 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to tease the little guys at the gym who were trying to get to 19, 20 
and 21 (inches)," says Zumwalt, the muscleman of "Alegria," Cirque du Soleil's 
eighth production, which is running at the Santa Monica Pier until Dec. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'You boys measure in inches. You gotta do it in feet if you're a real 
man.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A little gym humor there. His secret? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm into the mega-eating program," confides Zumwalt, who began his young 
athletic life with the shotput when asthma ruled out more mobile sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Take all that muscular muchness and process it through the Cirque-ulator and 
you come out with this amazing feat of pure unadulterated manpower: Zumwalt 
plucks a woman out of the audience for a tug-of-war -- and loses. 
</P>
<P>
 Come again? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of the changing world and changing values as well," says Cirque du 
Soleil artistic director Gilles Ste-Croix, whose latest show celebrates the 
recent changes in world power. "A big macho guy has to learn there is other 
stuff than being macho. He's so huge, he's a mountain. But he has a heart of 
faience, of very delicate porcelain. He's a very sensitive man." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so Zumwalt bends steel too. And he's working on potentially new derring-do 
in which he would pick up the entire troupe -- 6,800 pounds of acrobats, clowns 
and contortionists -- and carry the world on his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be child's play for the Hisperia resident and former world 
arm-wrestling champion. A dragon tattoo crawls down his mighty left breast. A 
long-ish braid snakes out the back of his otherwise bald head. And of course, 
there is the porcelain heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was arm-wrestling a guy one time," says Zumwalt, 42. "I looked at him, and 
said, 'This guy's a joke,' very slender and very animated. So I just decided to 
give him a hard time. I locked up and held him there, and he's trying all these 
different angles. This was in the middle of a mall where they had a state 
championship going on. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was standing up and his belt broke, and his pants fell off and he didn't 
know it. I stopped in the middle of the match, walked behind him and pulled his 
pants up and walked back. He was blood red. We started again and I went through 
him real quick. Mercy killing." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, put the pants on a movie star and it's a different story. The star 
in question was Sylvester Stallone, who helped launch Zumwalt's brawny film 
career when they arm wrestled for 1985's "Over the Top." The scene was shot 
before a crowd at the Las Vegas Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, Sly wanted to lose, but (director Menahem Golan) put it up to the 
audience. 'Who do you want to win? Do you want Rick to win?' And I got a very 
nice amount of applause. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Do you want Sly to win?' And it was overpowering. 'OK, Sly, you win by 
popular demand."' 
</P>
<P>
 But Zumwalt won parts in 15 more (mostly action) movies. In fact, Zumwalt was 
a faux strongman in films before becoming a real one for Cirque. For "Batman 
Returns," he played a tattooed strongman. 
</P>
<P>
 So when a show business friend of Zumwalt heard of Cirque du Soleil's plan to 
harken back to the company's street-performing roots by casting a strongman, he 
suggested Zumwalt for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'You're out of your mind.' I said, 'I'm 42 years old.' I said, 'No 
way. I think the stage scares me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ste-Croix says the transition to the stage from film, which offers the safety 
net of multiple takes, wasn't easy for Zumwalt. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the beginning, we say, 'Oh, we made a mistake,' " he says. "But a 
performer onstage has to have show-biz reflexes and that is growing on him 
slowly." 
</P>
<P>
 Travel with Cirque has also given Zumwalt, a recovering alcoholic for 10 
years, fresh venues for his talks to teens about the perils of drugs and 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say, 'Pal, I've been there. Put down the bottle. Put down the pipe and come 
with me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Zumwalt's experience muscling his way around Cirque's big top has 
given new meaning to the words stage fright . 
</P>
<P>
 "I scare me in a dark alley."

THEATER REIVEW; 'NO MIRACLE' SINGS WITH HUMOR, EMOTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like the AIDS quilt, "No Miracle: A Consolation" is constantly evolving. In 
1988, the project consisted of only 12 songs. In the current production at 
Highways, the number of songs has swelled to 37 and is still growing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this is a work in progress, it is in no way unformed. A song cycle 
about AIDS, "No Miracle" is a polished and important work by lyricist Philip 
Littell, who collaborated with Eliot Douglass and a number of other composers 
on the piece. As Littell's heartfelt response to the AIDS crisis, this is as 
much diary as drama. Teeming with references about personal friends and fellow 
artists who have passed on, the cycle is continuously expanding to fit present 
realities. 
</P>
<P>
 And in defiance of grim reality, the show is often triumphantly funny. In "He 
Never Told Me," a man grouses about his feelings of onerous obligation toward 
an obnoxious former lover, who once jilted him unceremoniously. "We don't even 
like him," laments the man, who nonetheless does his duty by his dying 
acquaintance, concluding that because he is "not dear, but here," he deserves 
nurturing and care. 
</P>
<P>
 Other numbers leave you emotionally floored. In the beautiful "Early 
Christmas," a mother celebrates the holiday early, poignantly aware that the 
next Christmas will never come for her child. 
</P>
<P>
 Littell, who also performs in the show, co-directed with fellow performer Rob 
Campbell. Littell and Campbell have amassed a wonderful cast, which besides 
themselves includes Ellen Geer, Melora Marshall, Michael Bonnabel and Douglass, 
whose elegant piano accompaniment is the show's backbone. Geer's voice is 
hardly virtuosic, but despite her vocal limitations, she sells her numbers with 
the dash of a seasoned chanteuse. Marshall has a pleasantly throaty voice that 
combines well with her air of complete conviction. The best singer in the show, 
Bonnabel hits the warbling high notes of an accomplished Irish tenor in the 
beautiful "The Birds," a thanatopsis about the passing of time that has all the 
earmarks of a folk classic.  
</P>
<P>
 As for Littell, he is a writer of exceptional promise whose songs are 
alternately urbane and elemental, dripping with sophisticated sarcasm or as 
stark and simple as a child's nursery rhyme. Part John Donne, part Jacques 
Brel, Littell is a metaphysical balladeer for our time. Every man's death 
diminishes him, but his talent grows in proportion to his -- and our -- grief.

produced two prodigious musical brothers. Odair and Sergio, who performed at 
the Ambassador on Thursday, are dazzling guitarists, together and apart. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's yet another guitar-wielding Assad, sister Badi. Her surprise 
appearance, playing a couple of Brazilian-jazz pieces on the program, both 
broadened the musical palette and tipped the balance away from classical 
repertoire. Unfortunately, the change necessitated the sacrifice of Bach's 
French Suite and one movement of Argentine master Alberto Ginastera's Sonata 
No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Bach might have given the program a structural pillar, but the infectious 
spirit of the evening was hard to argue with. The Assad brothers possess an 
uncanny sense of cohesion and a technical command, performing guitar music for 
four hands with an almost unearthly ease and profound musicality. 
</P>
<P>
 This was particularly evident when they tackled Latin music, whether Isaac 
Albeniz's extravagant "Cordoba" or the Ginastera's passion-laced modernism. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergio Assad's own "Saga does migrantes" takes a poignant, programmatic tack, 
tracing the saga of a rural Brazilian migrant's sojourn to the city. 
Delineations between serious and vernacular touches of jazz and folk music are 
not so much stitched together as they are melted into an organic whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Morel's duo-specific "Rhapsody for Two Brothers" is a subtly propulsive 
piece, full of cascading triplets and delicately honed dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshest of all was Roland Dyens' "Cote Nord," in its Los Angeles premiere, 
which gamely juxtaposes serial techniques with almost wistful themes. Here, the 
brothers swapped venturesome guitaristic effects -- harmonics, percussive 
touches -- like furtive secrets, leading up to an athletic, dexterous finale. 
</P>
<P>
 For an encore, the three Assads took the stage to perform a piece by Sergio, 
with Badi trading her guitar for the berimbau , a one-stringed, two-note 
percussion instrument from Brazil. In all, the family business left a strong 
impression.

CRITIC TAKEN TO TASK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those of us who follow art wait for the Cathy Curtis review of any show at 
Newport Harbor Art Museum to see how she will manage to bash it ("An 
Essentially Hollow 'Gesture' in Sculpture," Oct. 25). 
</P>
<P>
 She says that she would have preferred to focus on the "vulnerability, power, 
allure and implied movement" rather than a historic progression.These are all 
implicit in the pieces. Had the curator chosen that route, we can be sure she 
would have faulted him for failing to show the historic progression. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, the museum has invited high school students to a program of ballet 
beautifully coordinated with the idea of sculpture in space. This would have 
been worthy of note. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Cathy Curtis often has insight that is helpful, someone should help her 
understand that her hostility impairs her judgment when the Newport Harbor 
museum is her subject. 
</P>
<P>
 It is becoming a standing joke because of its predictability.

TV REVIEWS; A QUIRKY TNT LOOK AT DR. SEUSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Theodor Geisel, better known to millions as Dr. Seuss, was a unique artist, a 
comic genius whose signature drawings and rhythmic language reflected a deeply 
felt social conscience. "In Search of Dr. Seuss," a delightfully quirky, 
celebrity-studded mix of documentary and family entertainment airing Sunday on 
TNT, captures the life and art of the man who found his inspiration and his 
sense of humor by "looking at life through the wrong end of the telescope." 
</P>
<P>
 The show, written by Keith R. Clarke and directed by Vincent Paterson, is 
constructed as a magical, musical tour through old family photographs, archival 
film clips, excerpts from Geisel's animated features and encounters with 
characters from his books. It traces the artist's evolution from political 
cartoonist, successful advertising man and Academy Award-winning, anti-Fascist 
documentarian to children's author-illustrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Going along for the ride is "Sister Act's" bright-eyed Kathy Najimy, as an 
inquiring journalist. Her guide is the eccentric Cat in the Hat (Matt Frewer, a 
perfect piece of casting). Andrea Martin, Christopher Lloyd, Eileen Brennan and 
David Paymer turn up in various Seussian guises. Robin Williams reads "The Cat 
in the Hat" to two fidgety little girls, Howie Mandel and Billy Crystal provide 
voices for Sam-I-Am (of "Green Eggs and Ham" fame) and a sociable Voice of 
America radio, respectively. Most memorable is a Cyrano-nosed Patrick Stewart 
as Sgt. Mulvaney, the Irish police officer from Mulberry Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The pace flags during song-and-dance numbers, but the show's off-the-wall 
tone, and the production design by Tom Walsh and costumes by Merrily 
Murray-Walsh are deliciously true to Dr. Seuss' unique vision of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 * "In Search of Dr. Seuss" airs at 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. Sunday on TNT.

TV REVIEWS; 'GENGHIS COHN' RISKY BUT FUNNY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Genghis Cohn" is a TV original -- an audacious, eyebrow-raising comedy about 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Risky but funny, this Holocaust-inspired curiosity about a Nazi who turns into 
a postwar Jew is a bountiful mix of high purpose and stylish frivolity. Its 
black humor throws German guilt and the redemptive power of memory into 
unexpected, sensitive light. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bizarre prologue set in 1930s Germany, the title character (the sad, 
grinning Antony Sher) is a Jewish ventriloquist with a nightclub act featuring 
Hitler as his strident dummy in scenes that could be straight out of "Cabaret." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the ventriloquist's days are numbered. We last see him alive in a 
concentration camp facing his executioner over an open pit. Suddenly he wheels 
about, bullets tearing into his chest, and screams "Kiss my ass!" in Hebrew.  
</P>
<P>
 An A&E-BBC production shot in Bavaria, the ensuing plot jumps ahead to Germany 
in 1958. The chickens have come home to roost as the cajoling, avenging ghost 
of the Jew returns to torment and pester a flustered former Nazi (Robert 
Lindsay). The latter is now a pillar of the community, a police commissioner 
trying to bury his Gestapo past while comically hunting down a serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
 Some viewers may be offended by the material's humorous approach to 
anti-Semitism. For instance, under the influence of Cohn's ghost, the ex-Nazi 
is slowly transformed into a Jew who even looks like Hitler and becomes a 
voracious fan of chopped liver and "The Diary of Anne Frank." 
</P>
<P>
 But the conclusion drops its sly mask and abruptly shifts to a grim tone. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the novel "The Dance of Genghis Cohn," by Romaine Gary, the 
production is smartly adapted (by Stanley Price), cleverly directed (by Elijah 
Moshinsky) and inventively acted -- including a ripe performance by Diana Rigg 
as a lustful German baroness who yearns for the war's good ol' days. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Genghis Cohn" airs at 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. Sunday on A&E. RAY LOYND

TV REVIEWS; 'EARTH 2': NOT-SO-FUTURISTIC VISIT TO FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last of the fall season's new series arrives Sunday night, and it isn't 
worth the wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-produced by Steven Spielberg's Amblin Television, NBC's "Earth 2" is set 
200 years in the future, when earthlings live in the sterile environments of 
giant orbiting space stations.A woman named Devon Adair (Debrah Farentino) 
organizes an expedition to an Earth-like planet that she hopes holds a better 
future for her physically impaired young son and others. What they embark on is 
very much a neo-westward movement, reminiscent of the settling of what is now 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Big problems arise when the group crash-lands, destroying its high-tech 
equipment. When they're not bickering among themselves, Devon and her 
colleagues (other cast members include Clancy Brown, Antonio Sabato Jr. and 
Jessica Steen) worry about their well-being and the unknown surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something's out there . . . ," says Devon. Nothing that can release this 
plodding two-hour premiere from its lethal doldrums, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Filmed near Santa Fe, N.M., "Earth 2" has a nice, cinematic look, but ho-hum 
special effects and unimaginative aliens (technically, the Earth visitors are 
the aliens) that range from a cuddly little Yoda-like creature to lumpy, 
mummyesque palookas that are more comical than menacing. 
</P>
<P>
 Only when "Earth 2" belatedly plunges into a dreamlike realm of time warps and 
overlapping realities does it become interesting. Otherwise, the opening story 
is neither futuristic (wait until you see the clunky weapons) nor suspenseful. 
You don't worry even when Devon's kid vanishes, because aliens never kill kids. 
It's a rule. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Earth 2" premieres at 7 p.m. Sunday on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39).

STATE JOBLESS RATE PLUNGES TO 7.7%; ECONOMY: CALIFORNIA IS BUOYED BY BRIGHTER 
EMPLOYMENT PICTURE. SPEED, INTENSITY OF RECOVERY REMAIN UNCERTAIN. O.C.'S 6% 
SEPTEMBER STATISTIC IS MOST RECENT ONE AVAILABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 California's slow-blooming economic recovery gained speed in October as the 
state's jobless rate dropped to 7.7%, the lowest in nearly three years, the 
U.S. Labor Department reported Friday. Nationally, unemployment edged down 
one-tenth of a percentage point to 5.8%, the lowest level in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. employment continued to grow at a solid, if unspectacular, pace last 
month, adding 194,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday's employment reports, which included news of rising wages, 
triggered deep fears in financial markets of renewed inflation. The Dow Jones 
industrial average slumped 38.36 points to 3,807.52, bringing its loss for the 
week to 123.14 points, the biggest weekly decline in more than two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields on the 30-year Treasury bond, a key indicator of inflationary 
sentiment, climbed to 8.15%, up from 8.10% and reaching the highest level in 
more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong economic growth nationally -- by raising the likelihood the Federal 
Reserve will boost interest rates to prevent inflation -- "is a risk to 
California, since we're just at the beginning of a recovery phase," said Larry 
Kimbell, director of the UCLA Business Forecasting Project. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's performance lags far behind the recovery that has stimulated job 
growth nationally. The nation has added nearly five million jobs since 
mid-1990, but by one estimate, California has roughly 400,000 fewer people at 
work today than four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County, which along with San Diego has been the weakest link in 
the state's recession-ravaged economy, is joining California's rebound -- or, 
at least, bottoming out. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County's jobless rate fell to 7.8% in October, down from 8.3% in 
September, and the lowest level since April, 1992. October marked the second 
consecutive monthly drop, and a significant improvement in a jobless rate that 
averaged 10% the first eight months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's jobless rate was 6% for September, the most recent month for 
which figures are available. That was up slightly from August's 5.9%. Labor 
analysts said the slight rise came largely from regional drops in manufacturing 
and high-technology employment. October figures for Orange County are to be 
released Nov. 18.  
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles looks like it's flat or barely in recovery, while the rest of the 
state is definitely in recovery," Kimbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most experts are confident that California's job situation is getting 
healthier, the true speed and intensity of the state's fledgling recovery still 
are being debated. And the latest reports intensified that debate. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the Labor Department's survey of households used to calculate the 
jobless rate showed the number of Californians at work rising by 239,000 in 
October, bringing the gain over the last two months to more than 400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But a sharply contrasting situation was portrayed by the federal government's 
companion survey of employer payrolls, which traditionally is considered the 
more precise yardstick of employment. It reported that the state's job total 
dropped by 7,900 last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts increasingly believe that the true state of the state's economy lies 
somewhere in between the two monthly employment reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Other economic indicators, such as state tax receipts, auto sales, retail 
sales and housing permits "all are pointing toward a pretty good recovery," 
said Ted Gibson, principal economist for the State Department of Finance. 
</P>
<P>
 His office estimates that the state currently is gaining a moderate 15,000 
jobs a month, and many economists agree with that general assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists fault the payroll survey for failing to count jobs created at young 
firms founded since 1991. But they also believe that the household survey, 
which was redesigned at the beginning of this year, is overstating job growth 
and is not yet properly accounting for seasonal trends in the economy.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, analysts were encouraged by California's 7.7% jobless rate in October, 
down from 8.3% the month before. The state's rate has declined three months in 
a row, and is down from 9% in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "California is just coming around now," said Howard Roth, a senior economist 
at the Bank of America. "We bottomed much later than the rest of the country 
and are now just beginning to come back."  
</P>
<P>
 The defense and aerospace industries, so prominent in the state's economy, 
have finally stanched their "hemorrhage of jobs," said Labor Department 
official Thomas Plewes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, there were broad gains in retailing employment, including jobs at 
auto dealers, furniture stores and general merchandise stores, according to 
Katherine G. Abraham, commissioner of Labor Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the country, just as in California, job declines are moderating in 
defense-related industries, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense-related jobs were disappearing at the rate of 8,000 a month this year 
throughout the United States. But the losses slowed to 3,000 in October. 
Aircraft and parts jobs, dropping at the rate of 5,000 a month, declined only 
1,000 last month. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, campaigning in Minnesota for Democratic senatorial 
candidate Ann Wynia, bragged about the nation's falling unemployment rate, 
saying it demonstrated his Administration has "delivered what the American 
people have long wanted." The country is enjoying a "terrific recovery," 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 124.2 million Americans at work during October, and unemployment 
totaled 7.6 million, according to the household survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The companion survey of payrolls put last month's job growth at 194,000, 
considered a healthy gain but down from the average monthly increase of 275,000 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor force growth is accelerating as more Americans, sensing improved 
opportunities, are seeking work. Just as bad times discourage people and cause 
them to drop out of the work force, a robust economy draws more prospective 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department also reported Friday that average hourly earnings rose to 
$11.24, a gain of eight cents and the biggest monthly rise since an identical 
increase of 8 cents in September, 1983. However, a single month's figure should 
not be viewed as a harbinger of inflation, according to BLS chief Abraham.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am disinclined to make too much of it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street was not reassured, and the markets reacted negatively to the 
employment report. Interest rates rose across the board in the bond market, on 
the expectation that the Federal Reserve Board will have to tighten credit for 
a sixth time this year to try to slow the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's policy-making committee will meet on Nov. 15, amid widespread 
predictions that a rate hike is imminent.

DEVELOPERS FEUD OVER NEED FOR EL TORO AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Argyros and William Lyon, two prominent Orange County developers who 
once co-owned a California airline, are now feuding publicly over Tuesday's 
countywide vote on putting a commercial airport at the Marine Corps base at El 
Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyon, once California's biggest home-builder, has taken out a full-page ad in 
Sunday's Times Orange County Edition pointing to Argyros as "the man behind 
Measure A" and saying proponents of a commercial airport at El Toro are 
"chasing a fool's dream" and are misleading voters with "half-truths and 
distortions." 
</P>
<P>
 Argyros, who is bankrolling the Measure A campaign favoring an El Toro 
airport, fired back Friday, saying, "The only fool I can think of right now is 
poor Bill." 
</P>
<P>
 In a "memorandum to Orange County voters and taxpayers," Lyon complained that 
he was finally speaking out on the issue, because he was "tired of seeing 
half-truths and distortions spread about the nonexistent benefits of this 
dangerous (ballot) initiative." 
</P>
<P>
 Argyros said the real reason Lyon is opposing Measure A is because he has a 
financial interest in blocking any competition with John Wayne Airport, where 
he owns Martin Aviation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a wonderful guy and (was) a good business partner. But I think he's 
losing it," Argyros said. Countered Lyon: "On this subject, George has already 
lost it. It's very clear that George wants an airport there. The only thing 
nobody can figure out is why." 
</P>
<P>
 The two men bought AirCal when the airline was in bankruptcy in 1981. After 
running it as partners for six years, they sold the company to American 
Airlines for $225 million, earning about $90 million in the deal. Lyon went on 
to multiply his fortune by building single-family homes, while Argyros made 
millions from apartment complexes. 
</P>
<P>
 Both profited from the real estate boom of the 1980s, and in 1991 they both 
were on Forbes magazine's list of the 400 richest people in America -- Lyon 
ranking No. 295 with a net worth of $350 million, Argyros at No. 382 with a net 
worth of $290 million. Declining real estate values, however, pushed both men 
off the list in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sunday's newspaper ad, Lyon says "I'm running this advertisement . . . to 
tell you that George Argyros is wrong" in pushing for the conversion of the El 
Toro Marine Corps Air Station into a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 He accuses airport proponents of dodging the truth about the proposed 
airport's costs, safety and economic benefits, along with the ability of John 
Wayne Airport to cope with Orange County's future aviation needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is, Measure A could cost taxpayers billions. Without billions to 
meet even the most minimal safety standards, El Toro would be a dangerous -- 
even deadly -- commercial airport. Yes, airports generate jobs, but not as many 
jobs as other potential uses for the land. The fact is, John Wayne Airport 
operates today at half of its real capacity . . . and can handle our air 
traffic needs for many, many years to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Several times during a telephone interview, Argyros insisted that he and Lyon 
are friends, and "I feel badly that he's taken this position. I really feel 
that he should know better. I'm really surprised he's not more careful with the 
facts. I think he's really misinformed." 
</P>
<P>
 Argyros suggested that Lyon was giving in to subtle pressure from members of 
the Orange County Board of Supervisors, the landlord for Lyon's Martin Aviation 
company. "Martin is dependent on the Board of Supervisors for help. (Lyon) has 
obligated himself to put improvements at John Wayne. The more traffic he can 
get at John Wayne, the better off Martin Aviation is," Argyros said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyon, too, said he and Argyros remain friends. And he said his opposition to 
Measure A stems not from any personal stake in John Wayne Airport, but from 
experience he gained during his 35-year career in the Air Force, from which he 
retired as a major general, and his concern that taxpayers were being misled. 
</P>
<P>
 "George has been cajoling me for months about supporting his position. As I 
watched this campaign evolve, I began to understand that the public was not 
getting the whole story. I began with a neutral position on this race, but not 
anymore," Lyon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyon said he is not necessarily against an airport at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying I'm opposed to an international airport there, but only if it 
goes through the (county planning) system. If we're going to put an airport 
there, it should be through a process where everybody can be heard and all 
options discussed," said Lyon, adding that he is a firm supporter of the El 
Toro Reuse Planning Authority, the county agency formed to organize a 
development plan for the Marine base. The agency is studying several 
development options, including an airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyon said Argyros and other backers of Measure A "are chasing a fool's dream 
of an airport that would be unsafe, poorly planned, too expensive and not 
needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Argyros argues that Orange County needs a new international airport at El Toro 
in order to compete in the global economy in the 21st Century.

CHINESE BREAK LAW TO SEE POPULAR CORRUPTION SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONE TEMPEST, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Corruption and crime are such hot issues in China these days that people are 
willing to break the law to see them. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the Beijing Anti-Corruption and Bribery Exhibition, for example, 
sold out soon after the show opened last week, according to its official 
sponsor, the special state prosecutor's office. In some cases, factories or 
government departments purchased tickets for their entire work forces. 
</P>
<P>
 But ticketless folks had no problem getting into the crime show on a recent 
morning. Illegal scalpers were plentiful outside the museum, selling entries 
for six times the original price (about 30 cents). 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit, at the Chinese People's Military Museum, is closed to foreigners 
because of the negative picture it presents of officialdom. 
</P>
<P>
 But the prosecutor's office claims that more than 20,000 citizens come daily 
to the museum to see case histories and photographs of corrupt officials and 
white-collar criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Uniformed guides provide commentary. In front of the photograph of one 
convicted official, said a man who attended the exhibition, the guide reports 
that the wrongdoer's jet-black hair "turned snow-white as soon as he was 
arrested." 
</P>
<P>
 Another display features photographs of the handsome white-collar criminal 
Wang Feng, including one in which he is sipping brandy while surrounded by 
adoring and beautiful women. According to the case history, Wang once spent 1 
million yuan -- the equivalent of $120,000 -- on a single night's entertainment 
in a karaoke bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang, manager of a government-owned trading firm, was convicted in 1993 of 
obtaining 21 illegal bank loans totaling $60 million and using them for private 
pleasures. When police arrested Wang and his cohorts, they had only $4 million 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 Such details stunned some of the visitors to the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked by the amount of money," said a young bookkeeper from Hubei 
province who attended the show with her fiance, an air force enlisted man on 
leave from Inner Mongolia. 
</P>
<P>
 Others may have been attracted by the accounts of corruption and high living. 
The Chinese capital, it seems, has an insatiable appetite for crime news. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime reporting in daily newspapers has increased noticeably. Recent stories 
in Beijing have detailed police shootouts with armed hoods, a crackdown on 
railroad-ticket counterfeiters and a vice raid on prostitutes in a luxury 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most popular shows on television since it began airing in April is 
"Broadcast Focus" -- a prime-time investigative news show that reports on such 
subjects as child abuse in public day-care centers, battered women, restaurant 
hygiene and public corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 In the restaurant episode, reporters proved that a local eatery was reusing 
disposable wooden chopsticks by gluing them together to make them look new. In 
the child-abuse segment, the reporters exposed a provincial day-care worker who 
punished a 3-year-old girl for bed-wetting by beating her and burning her with 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most popular broadcasts, according to producer Sun Yusheng, are those 
on official corruption. "Corruption is the hot topic these days," Sun said in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his most recent shows focused, in fact, on the Anti-Corruption and 
Bribery Exhibition at the Military Museum. The exhibition was set up by the 
special prosecutor to demonstrate the government's firm resolve in combatting 
the corruption and white-collar crime sweeping China. 
</P>
<P>
 Even senior Chinese officials admit that corruption has become rampant since 
senior leader Deng Xiaoping began liberalizing the economy in the early 1980s. 
The official explanation is that corruption is an unpleasant side effect of a 
market economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But with 90-year-old Deng ailing, many senior officials fear that the 
corruption issue could turn against them in the succession battle that will 
inevitably follow his death. 
</P>
<P>
 The impression that senior public officials are considered beyond the law is 
deeply rooted here. A recent public debate over stringent new laws governing 
dog ownership in Beijing, for example, included a demand from one resident that 
the new rules also apply to "high-ranking officials living in independent 
compounds, so that it will not ruin their reputation in the minds of ordinary 
citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the official program sold at the door of the exhibition, the 
Beijing special prosecutor's office has handled 2,143 cases of corruption since 
1990. The cases have involved 41 senior officials, including two vice 
ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone at the exhibition was convinced that the prosecutor had netted 
all the bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
 One government employee who attended the show eavesdropped on two elderly men, 
both former bureaucrats, as they walked through the displays. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not very big," said the first. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," agreed his friend. "Most of the bigger crooks are still hidden." 
</P>
<P>
 "What about you?" said the first man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not hidden," replied the friend. "I'm retired."

POLICE FEAR PROP. 187 WILL CRUSH HARD-EARNED TRUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Albert Carretero didn't hesitate to stop by the sheriff's station on the 
Eastside last week to pick up some checks that had been stolen from him and 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 But after Tuesday, Carretero says, he will probably think twice about 
approaching police officers in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Better I lose my checks than lose everything and get sent back to Mexico," 
Carretero, a 21-year-old undocumented produce salesman, said as he left the 
station, property in hand. "It's not worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 The widespread concern about the potential impact of Proposition 187 has 
focused on its best-known provisions, those denying illegal immigrants public 
education and other tax-supported benefits, including non-emergency health 
care. But in communities statewide, law enforcement authorities and residents 
are bracing for the potential fallout from another proposition mandate, one 
that could profoundly alter always delicate relations between officers and 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 A section of Proposition 187 would require that police notify the U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service of the identities of all arrestees 
suspected of being illegal immigrants. That measure, critics say, could 
endanger immigrant-police cooperation, eroding the hard-won trust of a 
population that is often naturally suspicious of the police, who frequently 
take on the role of oppressor in Mexico and Central America.  
</P>
<P>
 "I never trusted the police in Mexico," Rafael Angel Martinez, a 38-year-old 
laborer, said as he stood outside his Eastside apartment on Whittier Boulevard 
on a recent evening, "but here I have a lot more confidence in the police." 
</P>
<P>
 Moments earlier, Martinez had called deputies to report a theft from his 
apartment, located behind a shop on Whittier Boulevard. Two men, he said, had 
driven up and stolen a roll of carpet that he had left outside his door. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had no right to take it," Martinez said, adding that he had bought the 
roll at a bargain rate and hoped to install it in his threadbare flat, its 
windows and doors covered with security bars. 
</P>
<P>
 After making his report to deputies, Martinez told a reporter that he was an 
undocumented worker from Mexico. He and his wife illicitly entered the United 
States two years ago via Tijuana, he said, following the well-trodden path of 
many before him. 
</P>
<P>
 Would he have approached the officers if he thought they would inquire about 
his residency status? 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably would have," Martinez responded with a smile, "but I think I'd be 
one of the brave few." 
</P>
<P>
 Police fear that people such as Martinez might avoid contact with officers, 
even to report crimes. Officers also are wary of taking on additional tasks in 
a time of already tight budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we assuming the role of the INS?" asked Lt. Thomas Angel at the East Los 
Angeles sheriff's station, which polices a sprawling enclave inhabited by many 
immigrants, both documented and illegal. "We're asked to do a lot now, and if 
we're asked to do more it'll drain our resources." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the official opposition to Proposition 187 -- voiced publicly by such law 
enforcement leaders as Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block and Los Angeles 
Police Chief Willie L. Williams -- is far from unanimous among rank-and-file 
officers, reflecting the sharply divided sentiments of the public at large. 
</P>
<P>
 In the report room of the East Los Angeles sheriff's station last week, 
several deputies, speaking privately, voiced their personal opinions that 
Proposition 187 is long overdue, and would not be so burdensome to implement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We check people's driver's licenses. Why can't we check their other papers?" 
asked one deputy, a Latino, angered by what he said was a proliferation of 
illegal immigrants receiving welfare and other benefits. "My parents and 
grandparents came over for work. Now they come over for a free ride." 
</P>
<P>
 But a second Latino officer agreed with only part of his argument. He said 
illegal immigration must be curtailed, but contended that the proposed 
initiative is too harsh. 
</P>
<P>
 "People come here to work; they never heard about welfare until they got 
here," the officer said. "I just can't see kicking kids out of school and not 
giving them health care." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the second deputy added: "I bet most cops are for Proposition 
187." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking for the record, deputies on the Eastside interviewed last week 
generally said they were neutral on Proposition 187 or were inclined to vote 
against it, a stance that aligns them with the top brass. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a pain" to implement, said Deputy Jose Mejia, a seven-year 
veteran of the department and native of the same Eastside community that he now 
patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Mejia said, officers are often caught in the middle of the 
contentious immigration debate: Legal residents criticize them for not doing 
enough about the sometimes-boisterous gatherings of day laborers and the 
proliferation of street vendors, while immigrant rights activists assail them 
for any crackdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get caught between everything," Mejia said as he guided his patrol car 
down the streets of the neighborhood where he grew up, occasionally stopping to 
chat in Spanish and English with longtime acquaintances. "It can be really hard 
for us." 
</P>
<P>
 As he drove past street vendors hawking everything from tamales to sweaters, 
Mejia noted the dilemma: The vendors are illegal and, technically, subject to 
fines and confiscation of their goods. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm supposed to be doing something about that," Mejia said as he drove by one 
corner salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he noted, in a high-crime, densely populated neighborhood where gang 
violence is endemic and police are relatively few, busting street vendors is 
often way down the priority list. Such is often the selective nature of 
policing an immigrant community, particularly one with a high undocumented 
population. The incidence of drivers lacking licenses is high on the Eastside 
and in other immigrant neighborhoods, officers said, especially since 
California began requiring proof of legal U.S. residency this year before 
issuing licenses. While technically required to cite unlicensed drivers and 
empowered to impound their cars, police say a more lenient approach often 
prevails. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to be flexible here; you've got to weigh the situation," one 
officer said. Even if Proposition 187 is approved, legal challenges are likely 
to test its law enforcement provisions. A state legislative report released 
last week concluded that requiring police to question arrestees about their 
residency status probably violates constitutional privacy laws. 
</P>
<P>
 If the proposition passes and is not thrown out in the courts, however, it 
will be left to counties and cities to find ways to put the requirements into 
effect. Experts cite several problematic areas, including the amorphous 
definition of who might be a "suspected" illegal immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they'll let us stop someone just because it looks like they're 
fresh from the border," said one sheriff's deputy, who was responding one night 
last week to a shooting on the Eastside.  
</P>
<P>
 Another hurdle, lawyers say, is defining who exactly is considered an 
arrestee, the only people who would be questioned about their status under the 
proposition. As Police Chief Williams has noted, even someone stopped for a 
traffic citation might be technically considered subject to such interrogation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the streets here and elsewhere, there is uneasiness, both among the 
law-abiding residents and the plethora of vendors, day laborers, false-document 
salesmen and others who engage in a thriving, if sometimes illegal, commerce.  
</P>
<P>
 "Right now I get along fine with the police, but I think that might change if 
they started stopping people for papers," said Luis Jaime Lugo, a 19-year-old 
native of Mexico who was selling tacos from his stand in East Los Angeles. 
"People would be scared." 
</P>
<P>
 Requiring police to check the residence status of detainees would alter years 
of limited cooperation between many local law enforcement authorities and the 
INS, a separation often achieved through lawsuits and vociferous protests. 
Immigrant rights monitors say the LAPD has strong policies that, for instance, 
restrict officers from questioning people simply because of their immigration 
status. Other departments put no limits on such questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, even in Los Angeles, relations between police and immigrants are 
often far from smooth: Activists from groups such as El Rescate, the Central 
American refugee organization based in the Pico-Union district, frequently 
accuse police of wrongly asking suspects for their residence documents. During 
the 1992 riots, the LAPD turned over hundreds of suspected illegal immigrants 
to the INS. 
</P>
<P>
 However, most immigrants seem to separate street cops from the long-dreaded 
INS, a benefit to police who rely on all residents to report crimes, provide 
witness statements and otherwise assist authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, police are here to protect us, not to ask us about our documents," 
said Leticia Sanchez, a 30-year-old mother of four from Mexico who was among 
the customers at Lugo's taco stand. "People will run away from police if they 
start asking for papers."

CLINTON ATTACKS PROP. 187 AT CITY HALL RALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER and JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton made his first direct, public attack on Proposition 187 
Friday, telling a crowd of more than 1,000 supporters gathered for a Democratic 
unity rally outside Los Angeles City Hall that the measure "is not the answer" 
to the state's problems with illegal immigration and urging Californians to 
defeat it. 
</P>
<P>
 And in contrast with some other states where Democratic candidates have shied 
away from Clinton, he was joined at the rally by nearly the entire California 
ticket, including U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and gubernatorial candidate 
Kathleen Brown, who came to Los Angeles with Clinton, waving to the crowd from 
the top of the City Hall steps. 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks, while other Administration officials openly denounced the 
controversial ballot measure, the President himself had stopped short of a 
definitive statement. Late last month, for example, Clinton told a press 
conference that he was troubled by parts of the measure but he shied away from 
urging Californians to vote no. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, top aides, including White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta, 
said that the President probably would not take a position on the measure 
because it was a purely state initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent weeks, as support for the proposition has begun to fade and as 
Democratic candidates here have stepped up their criticism of it, the White 
House stance has become stronger. Thursday night, in taped television 
interviews with California stations, Clinton openly opposed the proposition and 
Friday he took that opposition to the public, proclaiming to the crowd that "I 
hope to goodness you're going to beat 187." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's speech came after a day of campaigning in the Midwest and kicked off 
a two-day campaign swing through California on behalf of the Democratic ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton took turns denouncing each of the Democratic candidates' opponents. 
Attacking Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, Clinton said that he had "done 
everything I can" to try to channel federal funds to California but that "I 
need a partner" in the governor's office. "The governor's office is not a place 
for blamers, it's a place for builders," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, he charged, is now "pointing the finger of blame" on immigration 
problems but had "helped to create the problem" as a senator by voting to 
create a guest-worker program for farm workers "because powerful interests 
wanted them to work for low wages." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown took Wilson to task for blaming immigrants and making cuts in education 
to balance the state budget.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are tired of having our children forgotten. We are tired of having our 
students forgotten," Brown said. "We need a governor who will plan for all 
California, not just the few."  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also ridiculed the Republican Senate nominee, Rep. Mike Huffington of 
Santa Barbara, saying that Huffington's categorical rejection of government's 
ability to accomplish good makes him sound as if he is not only "running 
against Washington" but "running against George Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd hissed when Feinstein mentioned Huffington's name. U.S. Sen. Barbara 
Boxer, introducing her colleague, said Feinstein is "a woman who Mike 
Huffington cannot hold a candle to."  
</P>
<P>
 "I've got four more days in an election I never thought I would be in," 
Feinstein said. "So I need your help in the next four days to walk that walk 
and talk that talk to spread the message."  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, sounding hoarse, as he has much of the week but clearly enjoying his 
venture onto the campaign trail, laced into the Republican platform, as he has 
at campaign stops all week, saying that the GOP was trying to rerun the 
"politics of the past." 
</P>
<P>
 But while the partisan crowd cheered many of his remarks, the greatest 
enthusiasm came as Clinton attacked the immigration proposition. Indeed, much 
of the Democratic rally took on the air of an anti-187 forum, as speaker after 
speaker attacked the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Careful to avoid sending the wrong message to voters who may be undecided on 
the measure, rally organizers had distributed hundreds of small American flags 
to the audience, telling them to wave them at key points. Party strategists had 
worried that some anti-187 demonstrations earlier, featuring Mexican flags and 
other symbols, would turn off undecided voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton made a pitch to precisely those voters, saying he agrees that 
California has "borne an unfair burden in the cost of illegal immigration." His 
Administration, Clinton noted, had increased spending on the Border Patrol and 
on aid to California to offset some of the costs of immigration. He conceded, 
however, that Washington does "need to do more." 
</P>
<P>
 But Proposition 187 would be the wrong response, he declared. Echoing lines 
that opponents of the proposition have used repeatedly in recent weeks, Clinton 
said that the measure would "punish the children" by denying health coverage to 
those in the country illegally and would "turn the teachers into police 
officers." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton advisers hope that the President's presence here and in states in the 
Northeast and upper Midwest, in which his popularity is relatively high, can 
help counter a lack of enthusiasm among party faithful that Democratic 
strategists fear could sink their candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Clinton generally has avoided the South and the Rocky Mountain 
states, where he is deeply unpopular and where his presence probably would do 
his party's candidates more harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with San Francisco television station KGO on Friday, Clinton 
said that he has been campaigning in the East, the upper Midwest and the far 
West this week because "I'm going where I think I can do the most good." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Clinton campaigned in Minnesota, another state where he 
retains a favorable image and where Democrats hope to pick up a Senate seat 
currently held by the GOP. Clinton turned up the volume of his attacks on 
Republican leaders, saying that they are "playing to the worst instincts of the 
American people." 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats in Minnesota hope for a victory from Ann Wynia, their party's Senate 
candidate, who is in a close race with freshman Republican Rep. Rod Grams for 
the seat now held by retiring Republican Sen. Dave Durenberger. Minnesota is 
probably the Democrats' best shot, perhaps their only one, at stealing a seat 
now in GOP hands. And recent polls show the race to be a virtual dead heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton spoke on Wynia's behalf in a field house on the campus of the 
University of Minnesota at Duluth, praising the former majority leader of the 
Minnesota Legislature as "more of a doer than a talker." 
</P>
<P>
 In comments to reporters there, he scored GOP Chairman Haley Barbour, calling 
the GOP's Contract With America a fraud that promises a balanced budget and 
increased defense spending while lowering taxes on most Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton charged that the Republican plan would cost Social Security recipients 
$2,000 a year and "devastate" virtually every government program. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbour, in a series of television ads and interviews this week, has denied 
that his party is planning to cut Social Security or shut down the government. 
But he has not yet spelled out how the party would pay for its promises. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said the only way that Republicans can finance their pledges is by 
destroying the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, there's always the possibility that Haley Barbour's right -- 
they're just going to deliver the goodies and forget about paying for them. In 
which case, you go right back to the 1980s, exploding deficits, shipping our 
jobs overseas, putting our economy in the ditch," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's appearance was the second time Clinton has come to Minnesota for 
Wynia and he is planning a third visit there Monday as he tries to keep the 
Senate in Democratic hands. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 From Duluth, Clinton flew to Los Alamitos Naval Air Station in Orange County. 
On arrival, he was greeted by Feinstein, Boxer, Rep. Jane Harman and some 250 
McDonnell Douglas Corp. employees and officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton told the crowd there that the company's $1.6-billion agreement with 
the Chinese government to build 40 jetliners, which was signed Friday, "is a 
part of our ongoing effort to expand . . . and to maintain jobs in the United 
States."  
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials helped negotiate the deal, which calls for half of 
the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 and MD-90 jetliners to be built in China and the 
remainder in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton plans to speak to the National Assn. of Realtors at the Anaheim 
Convention Center this morning before flying on to a Democratic campaign rally 
in Oakland.

 "Baby killer!" they shouted. "Murderer!" 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Smith ducked down in her seat as she was driven to and from the Union 
County Courthouse on Friday, hiding her face from the town she is accused of 
deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
 The community had poured out its sympathy and concern since Oct. 25, when 
Smith claimed that her two young sons had been taken from her at gunpoint along 
with her car. But on Friday, the day after authorities said Smith confessed to 
killing 3-year-old Michael and 14-month-old Alexander, neighbors, co-workers 
and former classmates reacted with anger, hurt and a deep sense of betrayal. 
</P>
<P>
 Many stood for hours in front of the courthouse to jeer, to try to come to 
grips with their emotions, or just to be a part of the biggest spectacle anyone 
ever remembers occurring in these parts. 
</P>
<P>
 But amid the flowing tears, angry shouts and plentiful calls for Smith's 
execution, no one could offer an explanation for why she might have taken her 
children's lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no answers as to what happened," said Margaret Gregory, one of 
Smith's relatives. "We do not understand why it happened, and I don't know that 
we ever will." 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Smith's estranged husband, David -- who had reunited with her during the 
nine-day ordeal -- was said to be devastated and in seclusion, refusing even to 
speak to his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining to reveal the contents of Susan Smith's confession, Union County 
Sheriff Howard Wells indicated that he believed she acted alone. "At this time, 
I think this case is probably not going to lead to any other arrests," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't elaborate on any of the investigative techniques that were used or 
any of the reasons we believe what we believe," he added, indicating that he 
didn't want to prejudice the jury that eventually will try the case. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy performed Friday morning revealed that Michael and Alexander were 
still alive when Smith's car rolled into John D. Long Lake on the night Smith 
reported them missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells refused to comment on a letter from Smith's former boyfriend that 
authorities reportedly found in her home that said he was breaking off the 
relationship in part because of her children. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer went before reporters to read a statement from Tom Findlay that 
acknowledged he had broken off the relationship last month in part because he 
was "not ready to assume the important responsibilities of being a father." 
</P>
<P>
 The statement went on to say, however, that this was not the primary reason 
for the breakup. "At no time did I suggest to Miss Smith that her children were 
the obstacle to any potential relationship with her," it read. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities had been set to reveal part of their case at a bail hearing that 
was to be held Friday. After meeting with her attorneys at the courthouse, 
however, Smith waived a bail hearing at this time. She was transferred to a 
state prison near Columbia, S.C., where a spokeswoman said she would be kept in 
isolation for her safety. 
</P>
<P>
 While Wells would not confirm reports that Smith had received death threats, 
security was unusually tight. About 45 officers were posted in the courtroom 
and around the courthouse for her appearance -- instead of the usual eight or 
10. Wells said the precautions were taken because of the high emotions raised 
by the case. 
</P>
<P>
 What made it all so difficult to believe and comprehend, said person after 
person, was that Smith was such a good mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my observation of her, it seems that she was a very good mother," said the 
Rev. Mark Long, pastor of the Buffalo United Methodist Church, the church Smith 
sporadically attended. "She loved those children." 
</P>
<P>
 "She took good care of them," said April Vincent, a former classmate of 
Smith's who also worked with her for a time at the local Winn-Dixie 
Supermarket. "It just doesn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a secretary at a textile mill, and David Smith filed for divorce last 
month. Friends said the relationship had been stormy, punctuated by breakups 
and reconciliations and accusations of adultery on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knew they had problems," said Vincent, who still works at 
Winn-Dixie, where David Smith is an assistant manager. She said Susan Smith 
would often come into the store to confront her husband over her suspicions 
that he was having an affair with another store clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 "She'd come in and say, 'I know you're going behind my back,' " Vincent said. 
She would always have the two children with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent said Susan Smith has always been subject to bouts of depression and 
has in the past attempted suicide. Smith is reportedly being held under a 
suicide watch in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Long said he knows nothing of suicide attempts, but he did say that her father 
committed suicide when Smith was a child. Some who know her speculate that the 
trauma of the suicide might have had long-term effects. 
</P>
<P>
 In their confusion and disbelief, townspeople reached everywhere for 
explanations. "I still kind of think that maybe she just snapped for a little 
while and now she really believes the story she made up," said Hazel Ford, 
whose niece went to high school with Smith. She marveled that Smith could 
convince so many people of her story. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton on Friday called Wells to praise him for his handling of the 
case and to praise the town for remaining racially united throughout the search 
for the nonexistent gunman. Smith had claimed that a black man had hijacked her 
car and kidnaped her children.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the racial problem raised its head until the case had been 
solved," Wells said during an impromptu news conference in his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Smith's story has been revealed to be a hoax, black residents of the 
community have expressed anger at the racial undertones of the allegation. "I 
think it's a shame that some of them are voicing their opinion so loudly," 
Wells said. "I think it might give the community a bad name."  
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff, who is a godfather to the children of Smith's brother, knows the 
family and said that the case has been emotionally difficult for him. He said, 
however, that he has treated the case no differently because of his intimacy 
with the family and said race was never a factor in how he handled the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The sense of betrayal in the county of 35,000 residents is profound. Despite 
rising suspicions about Smith's story, the news that she had been arrested and 
that the children had been killed left many here devastated. The 
disillusionment, anger and sadness poured forth Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really believed her," said Ford, who had come into town with her husband, 
Danny, to film what they described as a "historic" occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fords said that they had never met Smith, had never heard of her. But 
during the nine days that much of the nation was riveted by the drama -- when 
hundreds of locals scoured the countryside for signs of the boys, when prayer 
vigils were held, tears were shed and yellow ribbons sprouted like daffodils 
throughout the county -- the entire community bonded together to help bear 
Smith's pain.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was just like a member of the family," Ford said. Now, she said, she feels 
taken in, betrayed.  
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways it's almost as if she just sucked everybody in," Long said. But 
the bitterness many here express does not represent the sentiments of the 
entire community, he stressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There still are people who are willing to pray for her and to care for her. 
We're not going to count her out." 
</P>
<P>
 The town had been festooned with yellow ribbons during the time the boys were 
missing. Many of the ribbons still were evident Friday, but here and there they 
were being replaced with blue and white ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The white ribbon is for purity, them being in heaven, and the blue is for the 
boys," said Eleanor Scott, who works at a downtown insurance office that had 
the ribbons on its door. Referring to the case during a campaign appearance in 
Duluth, Minn., Clinton also tried to console area residents who had become so 
caught up in the ordeal and who now feel manipulated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very important that they not feel in any way that their efforts are 
diminished," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't want them to believe that what the mother did in any way 
diminished what they did, their character, their quality, their courage," 
Clinton said.

FEINSTEIN EMPLOYEE HAD PERMIT TO WORK, INS SAYS; POLITICS: AGENCY REPORTS THAT 
PERMIT EXPIRED DURING IMMIGRANT'S EMPLOYMENT BUT NO FEDERAL LAWS WERE BROKEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After several wild days of accusations and retractions in the fiercely 
contested U.S. Senate race, the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
confirmed Friday that the woman employed by U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein as a 
housekeeper in the early 1980s entered the country with a legal work permit 
that expired while she was still working for Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 The INS said no federal laws were broken and in any case the hiring occurred 
years before a 1986 law made hiring illegal immigrants a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 INS records also show that the woman's work visa would have limited her to 
working at the Guatemalan Consulate and that the permit expired in November, 
1980 -- while she was employed by Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 The hiring occurred long before federal law made it a crime to hire illegal 
immigrants. But throughout the day, the Santa Barbara congressman was on the 
airwaves -- in commercials and television interviews -- accusing Feinstein of 
violating an obscure California labor law by hiring the housekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican challenger Mike Huffington has repeatedly attacked Feinstein this 
past week after admitting that he and his wife had employed an illegal 
immigrant as a nanny until last year -- long after the 1986 law that made such 
hiring illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue continued to frustrate Feinstein's campaign strategy to draw 
attention to her record of bipartisan support in cities and counties. In press 
conferences, she maintained that the woman she hired as a housekeeper in 1980 
showed her documentation that she was in the United States legally. She 
appeared with city and county officials in several cities who praised her 
record as a senator. 
</P>
<P>
 The immigration issue was only one of a series of events in the Senate race 
Friday: 
</P>
<P>
 * In another sign of the race's volatility, KNBC-TV released a poll that 
showed Feinstein with a 16-point lead over Huffington, up 10 points from a poll 
two weeks ago. The 52-36 margin came only days after another poll, done by a 
local television station, showed Huffington with a 2-point lead over Feinstein. 
KNBC attributed its results to Huffington's disclosure about breaking the law 
by hiring the nanny. 
</P>
<P>
 * Entering the last frantic weekend of campaigning, Feinstein traveled to 
several cities while Huffington concentrated on Los Angeles, with several 
television appearances. On a local cable television program, he called 
Feinstein a "hypocrite" and accused the INS of a "cover-up," though he offered 
no proof. 
</P>
<P>
 * The costliest race in congressional history also got more expensive. 
Campaign disclosure reports showed that Huffington gave another $500,000 to his 
campaign, raising the total to nearly $28 million, which again breaks national 
spending records for a congressional race. Feinstein loaned her campaign 
$70,000, bringing its total close to $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Associated Press asked the Huffington campaign to withdraw a new 
commercial accusing Feinstein of breaking the law because, the wire service 
said, it was quoted erroneously in the ad. The Huffington campaign refused the 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles City Hall rally with President Clinton capped a day of 
barnstorming by Feinstein, who earlier Friday went to Sacramento and Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, more than a dozen city and county officials gave so many 
testimonials about their support for the senator that the chilled crowd on the 
City Hall steps began to thin out before the event ended. "I know that was a 
long litany but it is an important litany because this is my campaign . . . 
these press conferences are replicated up and down the state all week beginning 
with Mayor Richard Riordan in Los Angeles," Feinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never in the history of this nation has there been a race like this where one 
person with no record and no performance . . . has spent so much to attack and 
slander. Never, never, never in the history of this nation," Feinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeating a recent theme of her campaign, Feinstein implored her supporters to 
turn back Huffington's expensive campaign. "A Senate seat cannot be bought. A 
Senate seat must be earned. And the way you earn it is by performing," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's campaign was shadowed all day by the possibility that she may have 
misspoken about never having employed an illegal worker. And even if the 
circumstances differed significantly than those of her opponent, the 
distinction was sure to be blurred in campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 All day long, Huffington and his campaign accused Feinstein of lying about the 
former housekeeper's status. 
</P>
<P>
 The housekeeper was quoted Friday by Associated Press as insisting she was in 
the country legally. "Yes, I was legal. I already talked with her (Feinstein) 
and I am not going to say anything more," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Kenney, an INS spokesman in Washington, said a woman identified as 
Annabella del Rosario Legrand-Cabrera Realegeno, 44, entered the United States 
on Nov. 17, 1979, on a one-year visa that allowed her to work for the 
Guatemalan Consulate in San Francisco. He said that visa was good until Nov. 
16, 1980 -- months after Feinstein has said she hired the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenney said INS records show the woman's work authorization was limited to 
employment at the Guatemalan Consulate. But Kenney said it would have been very 
difficult for someone who was not an expert to determine what its limitations 
were. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know whether I would know by looking at a passport with a visa stamp 
in it, and I work for the INS," Kenney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the INS said the records did not suggest any violation of the law, 
the Huffington campaign said the information showed that Feinstein employed an 
illegal worker and that this constituted a violation of state law. 
</P>
<P>
 But an expert on the law raised some doubts about the contention. "There was a 
law on the books in the California Labor Code that technically made it illegal 
to hire undocumented workers," said Kitty Calavita, a professor in the 
Department of Criminology, Law and Society at UC Irvine. "But it effectively 
was a dead law. Virtually no one knew it existed. There was no enforcement 
machinery and there was no publicity about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Calavita added: "In contrast, the (federal) employer sanction law of 1986 was 
widely publicized and would have been hard for people not to know about." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein disputed those accusations throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I've said, this was back in 1980, the person in question handed me 
documentation. . . . It looked verifiable to me. And I hired her," Feinstein 
told reporters as she campaigned in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 At the San Francisco house where the woman now works as a housekeeper, her 
husband told The Times that she had entered the country legally and was 
permitted to work at the time she was employed by Feinstein. Miguel Realegeno, 
Annabella's husband, also disputed Huffington's ads saying the housekeeper was 
an illegal worker. "That's not true," Miguel Realegeno said. "We are not 
illegal in this country. She came with a visa. She never came here illegally. 
She did not work with illegal papers like they are saying on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Realegeno, who said he also worked for Feinstein and was a legal worker 
at the time, said Annabella entered the country legally in 1972 and that he met 
her in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Feinstein campaign called on television stations to stop running the 
Huffington ad on the issue, saying it was "potentially libelous." In a letter 
to the stations, campaign manager Kam noted that Associated Press has 
challenged the accuracy of the ad. 
</P>
<P>
 Associated Press San Francisco Bureau Chief Dan Day, who faxed a letter of 
protest to the Huffington campaign Thursday night, said Friday the news service 
was asking that the ad be pulled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The erroneous information in your ad can substantially damage that 
reputation. Please confirm to me that you will discontinue this 
misrepresentation of the AP's reporting," Day wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's campaign declined the request. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments this week: 
</P>
<P>
 * A Senate ethics complaint filed Friday contends that Feinstein would have 
personally benefited from her efforts to allegedly influence the Justice and 
Agriculture departments to drop 34 civil fraud suits against Sunkist Growers 
and its members. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein wrote officials this year, supporting dismissal of the 
whistle-blower suits, which seek $80 million to $400 million from Sunkist 
Growers for violating federal quotas on citrus shipments, the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint alleges that Feinstein held an interest in Newhall Land & 
Farming, which grows oranges and lemons for Sunkist -- based on Feinstein's 
1992 financial disclosure statement showing an investment of $500,000 to $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Her 1993 disclosure lists the investment at less than $1,000, however. Richard 
Blum, Feinstein's husband, said one of his partnerships divested the Newhall 
asset in September, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The ethics complaint was filed by James Moody, an attorney for Sequoia Orange 
Co., the firm that filed the whistle-blower suit against Sunkist. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethics experts said Feinstein's letters appear to fall within Senate rules. 
Hadley Roff, Feinstein's staff director in California, said her letters were 
proper. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department in September sought dismissal of the Sunkist case, 
despite having previously intervened on behalf of Sequoia. A spokesman said 
Feinstein's letter played no part in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 * State tax officials have questioned a former bookkeeper for the Huffington 
family as they opened a preliminary inquiry to determine if sales taxes of 
about $6,250 were paid on furnishings for the candidate's Montecito mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 The inquiry was prompted by the claim of bookkeeper Claudia Bratton that 
Huffington's wife, Arianna, purchased at least $100,000 worth of chairs, 
draperies and other items with a tax card issued to her sister, Agapi 
Stassinopoulos, by the State Board of Equalization. 
</P>
<P>
 The card allows interior designers to buy items from wholesalers without 
paying sales tax, if the goods are to be resold. But if the items are for 
personal use, the cardholder must pay the tax.

COLUMN ONE; WHEN A MOTHER KILLS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The fate of two little boys in South Carolina has forced Americans to confront 
painful questions about why a woman would take her own children's lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope they were asleep or something and didn't know the horror of dying 
alone in that car. I'm just stunned and disappointed in the mother. Evidently 
they were in the way of what she wanted to do with her life."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Alice Valentine neighbor of Susan Smith 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the idea is nearly impossible to comprehend. 
</P>
<P>
 The deaths of Susan Smith's two young sons in Union, S.C., and recent cases in 
San Jacinto, Calif., and Florida, have forced Americans to consider the 
possibility that a woman might kill her child -- then go on national TV to gain 
public sympathy by blaming someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 After nine days of listening to Smith's story that a carjacker had abducted 
her sons, Michael, 3, and Alexander, 14 months, the nation was shocked to learn 
Thursday that the 23-year-old mother had confessed to strapping the boys into 
car seats and driving her Mazda into a lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a week earlier, Dora Buenrostro of San Jacinto was arrested on suspicion 
of stabbing to death her three children, ages 9, 8 and 4, after failing to 
convince police that her estranged husband had killed them. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Florida, Pauline Zile was charged Friday with murder in the death of 
her 7-year-old daughter, whom Zile had earlier claimed had been abducted from a 
Ft. Lauderdale restroom. After a six-day nationwide search, police said, Zile 
confessed that her husband had beaten his stepdaughter to death. Walter John 
Zile has been charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 650 to 700 mothers kill their children each year, according to 
Richard J. Gelles, director of the Family Violence Research Project at the 
University of Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
 That represents more than half of the 1,300 children killed by parents or 
caretakers each year since 1976, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gelles suggests that mothers are slightly more likely than fathers to be 
involved in such cases because they have a greater responsibility for child 
care and endure a disproportionate amount of stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed studies have found that stress can play a large role in exacerbating 
the situations that often lead mothers to kill: 
</P>
<P>
 They suffer from severe mental illness; 
</P>
<P>
 They decide they no longer want their child; 
</P>
<P>
 They accidentally batter a child to death; 
</P>
<P>
 They want to seek revenge against a spouse; 
</P>
<P>
 And, strangely, they sometimes feel a misguided sense of altruism. These 
mothers either feel they are protecting a child from suffering, or identify 
with the child in a confused suicide attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The group we have the easiest time (understanding) have postpartum 
depression," said Mark J. Mills, a UCLA forensic psychologist. "They are really 
psychotic." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last two decades, about three dozen deaths have been attributed to 
the illness, which surfaces without warning with delusions, hallucinations and 
personality changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Other women suffer from illnesses including schizophrenia or bipolar 
depression. Pregnant women with these conditions may forgo their treatment 
because drugs such as lithium may put the fetus at risk, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some mothers may be healthy but appear to snap under the stress of raising a 
child without adequate support from family or friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Child rearing is about as demanding a task (as) there is," Mills said. It "is 
enormously taxing and challenging. You never have any private time or space. 
You're always beleaguered, often tired. It's a wonder more kids are not 
battered, beaten, drowned or killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Mothers under extreme stress often give clues -- telling others that they feel 
they will harm their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days, the visiting nurse used to come out and visit every new 
mom," said Elissa Benedek, a forensic psychiatrist at the University of 
Michigan Medical Center. "She was very sensitive about picking up clues." 
</P>
<P>
 But today, without such support systems, some mothers begin to feel 
incompetent, she said. They feel hopeless, as if they were painted into a 
corner. This may exacerbate other problems, including illness or feelings of 
isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many say 'I am overwhelmed. I can't take care of this child. I want to 
protect the child.' Sometimes they kill them in order to protect them," Benedek 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "They have tried to communicate to people how frightened and desperate they 
are," she said. "How scared, how worried, how overwhelmed and people don't 
listen. It is not a message that anybody wants to hear." 
</P>
<P>
 She said medical students are taught to pay attention "if there's a new mom, 
or any mom, who says she's worried she's going to harm her children." 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Myer, director of the Los Angeles-based Childhelp/IOF Child Abuse Hotline, 
said that counselors often help mothers on the edge. She said it's not uncommon 
to get calls saying, "If you don't help me stop this child from screaming, I'll 
kill him. . . . The sad part is that (a mother) could have called the hot line 
to get counseling or talk about their feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In concocting elaborate tales to cover their crimes, some mothers are relying 
on society's deep resistance to believing they could be responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Diane Downs was convicted of killing her 7-year-old daughter and 
wounding her two other children on a rural road outside Springfield, Ore., in 
1983. Downs had claimed that "a bushy-haired stranger" waved down her car on a 
deserted road and shot her children. Prosecutors alleged Downs shot her 
children because they were spoiling her relationship with a boyfriend who did 
not want to be a father. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Philadelphia mother Vivian King, 42, reported her 17-year-old 
daughter Shilie Turner missing. The community rallied around her, raging about 
the violence in the neighborhood. More than a month later, her bullet-ridden 
body was found in a park and King confessed to shooting her during what police 
said was an argument.

 In a widely publicized case in 1987, Sheryl Lynn Massip of Anaheim at first 
claimed that her baby had been kidnaped. But she later recanted and was found 
guilty of murder. The verdict was overturned by a judge who decreed Massip 
suffered from postpartum psychosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Some suggest the tales are so implausible that the mothers are harboring an 
unconscious desire to be caught and punished. 
</P>
<P>
 Others point to specific personality traits. 
</P>
<P>
 In premeditated cases such as Downs', there are three elements, said Ann Rule, 
who wrote a book about the case. "First, an antisocial personality. Second, 
histrionics. The actress taking over. Third, you have narcissism. 'I deserve 
whatever I want because I'm special.' Whatever they have to do to get what they 
want, they will do. And whoever gets hurt, that isn't really bad because 
they're so special." 
</P>
<P>
 One profile of a child killer is a sociopathic personality who has a reduced 
capacity to feel guilt and does not bond with others, including children.  
</P>
<P>
 Charles Ewing, professor at State University of New York-Buffalo, author of 
the upcoming book, "Fatal Families," suggested that it is the idea of deception 
that has triggered such outrage in the Smith case. 
</P>
<P>
 Some mothers can keep up an elaborate manipulation because they come to 
believe what they are saying. "In many of the cases, the natural response to 
the overwhelming guilt that you feel is denial. And that denial is immediately 
reinforced. You get this outpouring of sympathy and support. . . . In the long 
run, though, once it becomes apparent that she has deceived then the table 
turns and you go from being this very sympathetic mother to being the most vile 
of killers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a sense that we are going to punish you not only for killing your 
kids, but for what you did afterward, for taking us all for a ride." 
</P>
<P>
 Some suspect the current cases may only feed a growing national cynicism about 
parents who claim children have been abducted. But according to Ewing: "It may 
disabuse us of our naive notion that people don't hurt the people they love. 
Not only do they hurt the people they love, they also kill them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe that is cynicism, but it is also reality."

STATE JOBLESS RATE PLUNGES TO 7.7%; ECONOMY: CALIFORNIA IS BUOYED BY BRIGHTER 
EMPLOYMENT PICTURE. BUT THE SPEED, INTENSITY OF RECOVERY REMAIN UNCERTAIN. U.S. 
UNEMPLOYMENT DROPS TO 5.8%.

<P>
 California's slow-blooming economic recovery gained speed in October as the 
state's jobless rate dropped to 7.7%, the lowest in nearly three years, the 
U.S. Labor Department reported Friday. Nationally, unemployment edged down 
one-tenth of a percentage point to 5.8%, the lowest level in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. employment continued to grow at a solid, if unspectacular, pace last 
month, adding 194,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday's employment reports, which included news of rising wages, 
triggered deep fears in financial markets of renewed inflation. The Dow Jones 
industrial average slumped 38.36 points to 3,807.52, bringing its loss for the 
week to 123.14 points, the biggest weekly decline in more than two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields on the 30-year Treasury bond, a key indicator of inflationary 
sentiment, climbed to 8.15%, up from 8.10% and reaching the highest level in 
more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong economic growth nationally -- by raising the likelihood the Federal 
Reserve will boost interest rates to prevent inflation -- "is a risk to 
California, since we're just at the beginning of a recovery phase," said Larry 
Kimbell, director of the UCLA Business Forecasting Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Reaser, chief economist for First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles, 
agreed that California can't afford anything that will slow its comeback. "A 
modest recovery is under way, but it's not a rapid expansion by any means," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's performance lags far behind the recovery that has stimulated job 
growth nationally. The nation has added nearly five million jobs since 
mid-1990, but by one estimate, California has roughly 400,000 fewer people at 
work today than four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County, which along with San Diego has been the weakest link in 
the state's recession-ravaged economy, is joining California's rebound -- or, 
at least, bottoming out. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County's jobless rate fell to 7.8% in October, down from 8.3% in 
September, and the lowest level since April, 1992. October marked the second 
consecutive monthly drop, and a significant improvement in a jobless rate that 
averaged 10% the first eight months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles looks like it's flat or barely in recovery, while the rest of the 
state is definitely in recovery," Kimbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most experts are confident that California's job situation is getting 
healthier, the true speed and intensity of the state's fledgling recovery still 
are being debated. And the latest reports intensified that debate. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the Labor Department's survey of households used to calculate the 
jobless rate showed the number of Californians at work rising by 239,000 in 
October, bringing the gain over the last two months to more than 400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But a sharply contrasting situation was portrayed by the federal government's 
companion survey of employer payrolls, which traditionally is considered the 
more precise yardstick of employment. It reported that the state's job total 
dropped by 7,900 last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts increasingly believe that the true state of the state's economy lies 
somewhere in between the two monthly employment reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Other economic indicators, such as state tax receipts, auto sales, retail 
sales and housing permits "all are pointing toward a pretty good recovery," 
said Ted Gibson, principal economist for the State Department of Finance. 
</P>
<P>
 His office estimates that the state currently is gaining a moderate 15,000 
jobs a month, and many economists agree with that general assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists fault the payroll survey for failing to count jobs created at young 
firms founded since 1991. But they also believe that the household survey, 
which was redesigned at the beginning of this year, is overstating job growth 
and is not yet properly accounting for seasonal trends in the economy.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, analysts were encouraged by California's 7.7% jobless rate in October, 
down from 8.3% the month before. The state's rate has declined three months in 
a row, and is down from 9% in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "California is just coming around now," said Howard Roth, a senior economist 
at the Bank of America. "We bottomed much later than the rest of the country 
and are now just beginning to come back."  
</P>
<P>
 The defense and aerospace industries, so prominent in the state's economy, 
have finally stanched their "hemorrhage of jobs," said Labor Department 
official Thomas Plewes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, there were broad gains in retailing employment, including jobs at 
auto dealers, furniture stores and general merchandise stores, according to 
Katherine G. Abraham, commissioner of Labor Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the country, just as in California, job declines are moderating in 
defense-related industries, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense-related jobs were disappearing at the rate of 8,000 a month this year 
throughout the United States. But the losses slowed to 3,000 in October. 
Aircraft and parts jobs, dropping at the rate of 5,000 a month, declined only 
1,000 last month. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, campaigning in Minnesota for Democratic senatorial 
candidate Ann Wynia, bragged about the nation's falling unemployment rate, 
saying it demonstrated his Administration has "delivered what the American 
people have long wanted." The country is enjoying a "terrific recovery," 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 124.2 million Americans at work during October, and unemployment 
totaled 7.6 million, according to the household survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The companion survey of payrolls put last month's job growth at 194,000, 
considered a healthy gain but down from the average monthly increase of 275,000 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recovery is continuing, and is right about what we should be hoping for," 
said Dean Baker, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal 
think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor force growth is accelerating as more Americans, sensing improved 
opportunities, are seeking work. Just as bad times discourage people and cause 
them to drop out of the work force, a robust economy draws more prospective 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department also reported Friday that average hourly earnings rose to 
$11.24, a gain of eight cents and the biggest monthly rise since an identical 
increase of 8 cents in September, 1983. However, a single month's figure should 
not be viewed as a harbinger of inflation, according to BLS chief Abraham.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am disinclined to make too much of it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street was not reassured, and the markets reacted negatively to the 
employment report. Interest rates rose across the board in the bond market, on 
the expectation that the Federal Reserve Board will have to tighten credit for 
a sixth time this year to try to slow the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's policy-making committee will meet on Nov. 15, amid widespread 
predictions that a rate hike is imminent.

NEW FLOODING IN EGYPT THREATENS HISTORIC TOMBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fresh flooding swept through southern Egypt on Friday, drenching 70 additional 
villages, seeping water into some of the historic tombs of the pharaohs and 
collapsing 500 houses on the west bank of the Nile at Luxor. 
</P>
<P>
 And as survivors of a burning flood that surged from a fuel depot about 200 
miles south of Cairo this week began burying their dead, the discovery of 
dozens of new corpses pushed the death toll from the bizarre tragedy to more 
than 500. 
</P>
<P>
 Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak toured flood-stricken areas throughout 
southern Egypt, visiting a tent city of citizens displaced from the town of 
Durunka, where heavy rainstorms this week triggered a fuel spill and fire that 
sent burning gasoline washing with floodwaters through hundreds of homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The new flooding, reported in early editions of today's government press, 
raised alarms that Egypt's most precious antiquity sites could be at risk from 
the heaviest rainstorms in half a century. 
</P>
<P>
 Luxor is home to the Valley of the Kings -- the majestic canyon burial site of 
the greatest pharaohs of ancient Egypt -- as well as the well-known Temple of 
Luxor and Temple of Karnak. 
</P>
<P>
 The semiofficial newspaper Al Ahram said floodwater had entered nearly all of 
the historic tombs, decorated with delicate wall paintings that have already 
been threatened by the thousands of tourists who descend into their chambers 
each week. 
</P>
<P>
 The extent of any flood damage was not known, but the well-known tomb of the 
boy king Tutankhamen, whose treasures have been on display around the world, 
was one of only four not penetrated by the floodwater, Al Ahram said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no reports of flood damage on the opposite side of the Nile, where 
the famous temples lie. The Valley of the Kings lies in a deep, sloping canyon 
that is typical of the areas so far hardest hit by the fast-moving floods. 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 houses on the same side of the Nile at Luxor collapsed under the 
rush of the storm waters, the government press reported. That area of the Nile 
is full of mud-brick peasant homes, some of them designed as part of a model 
village created by the late architect Hassan Fathy, a celebrated proponent of 
natural building materials. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 70 other villages were also hit with flooding Friday in areas 
between Luxor and Asyut, the province in southern Egypt that until Friday had 
seen the bulk of the storm damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Mubarak toured several of the stricken villages in Asyut province and flew 
over devastated Durunka. The visit, a day after a similar tour by Prime 
Minister Atef Sedki, appeared intended to demonstrate the government's concern 
over the tragedy, which struck in a region that is a stronghold of Muslim 
fundamentalists opposed to the government. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll build you houses, a new school and get you some clothes," Mubarak 
told refugees from the Durunka flood as he toured their makeshift tent camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must build houses for the displaced people by any means possible. Start 
with the poor people. . . . Get in there and help," he advised a large group of 
ministers who toured the flood areas with the president. "It's a natural 
disaster. Does the state create disasters?" 
</P>
<P>
 Egyptian officials, stung when fundamentalist organizations responded more 
quickly than the government with tents and food for victims of a Cairo 
earthquake two years ago, have moved rapidly to pledge aid to victims of the 
flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 The provincial government of the stricken Asyut province announced that it 
will distribute $150 to the families of the dead, $60 to the injured and $7 to 
families who lost their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they were taking steps to establish four tent camps on army 
land near Durunka and were also preparing to set up temporary shelters in the 
youth center in Asyut, the provincial capital about five miles west of Durunka. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're taking count of the deaths, providing shelter, tents and blankets, and 
there will be in the future money given to these people," said Mohammed Abdel 
Mohsen Saleh, a spokesman for the local governing council. "It seems also that 
the government has the intention of rebuilding this area, and to pay people 
damages either in cattle or goods." 
</P>
<P>
 Several families said they will also seek to sue the public oil cooperative 
that operated the fuel-oil storage tanks whose exploded stores swept through 
the town of 22,000 at dawn on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 No one so far said they had received any cash compensation from the 
government, though many said they were getting help from private citizens in 
Asyut and from mosques -- a potential trouble sign for the government. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government is giving us no help yet. I assume they will. But in the 
mosque they are taking care of us, and on the road people are doing their duty 
toward us," one woman who lost her home in the inferno said in an interview 
Thursday in Durunka. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, other aid is trickling in. Planes from Saudi Arabia and Bahrain 
filled with relief supplies arrived at a military field near Cairo, while a 
pair of Egyptian air force planes took off for Asyut on Friday with a load of 
food and blankets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Egyptian army said it had 500 beds and mattresses for the homeless and 
would also distribute about 55 pounds of flour, rice and sugar to each 
displaced family. 
</P>
<P>
 And President Clinton, in Des Moines on Thursday, said he has ordered the U.S. 
Agency for International Development to offer assistance to victims of the 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people of Egypt can be sure that their American friends will stand by 
them in coping with the aftermath of this terrible event," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The process of identifying and burying the bodies has been a slow one, since 
many were burned beyond recognition and will likely be buried in mass graves. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency workers were still uncovering new bodies in the rubble, and it 
appeared that the final death toll will exceed the 500 dead discovered so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the toll were the discovery of 21 bodies in a mosque, where people 
had hidden to take shelter from the rushing floodwaters, and a family of 15 
that climbed to the fifth floor of a building adjacent to their house to escape 
the burning waters, only to die of smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80 of the dead were killed in flash flooding that struck six other 
villages in southern Egypt and took out a large chunk of the main desert 
highway that connects northern and southern Egypt.

 OPENINGS: Friday was another symbolic day for quake recovery: The interchange 
from the southbound Golden State Freeway to the northbound Antelope Valley 
Freeway was back in use (B4) and hundreds of shoppers showed up to celebrate 
the reopening of The Broadway at Northridge Fashion Center (B1). "It's a sign 
of rebirth," said Broadway shopper Marie McGee. 
</P>
<P>
 TIMBER: Friday, however, also brought a reminder that the quake is still with 
us. In Sherman Oaks, a three-story, 4,000-square-foot home that had been 
red-tagged for months fell down a hillside, and nobody knows why. "It could 
have been the rain or the wind," said Building and Safety Inspector Frank Bush 
(B1). . . . The home's owner could not be reached for comment.

BROWN'S CASH LOW, WILSON'S CONFIDENCE HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL and AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

 Starved for cash, the Kathleen Brown campaign for governor appeared to be 
running on the sheer energy of the candidate Friday, counting on a surge of 
support from President Clinton and a big anti-Proposition 187 vote to carry her 
to victory over incumbent Republican Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was ending his campaign for a second term much as he has in past 
statewide elections -- calm, confident, and sitting on what seemed to be a 
relatively comfortable lead in most public opinion polls. Wilson and his GOP 
ticket-mates gathered in Sacramento for an evening rally to kick off a weekend 
tour of major California media markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton flew to California for a second time to plug the Democratic ticket 
headed by Brown and Sen. Dianne Feinstein -- first at a big rally in front of 
Los Angeles City Hall on Friday evening and today in Oakland -- both areas 
where Democrats need substantial majorities to win. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, acting Secretary of State Tony Miller predicted a higher voter 
turnout Tuesday than in the last gubernatorial election. Miller estimated that 
60.2% of California's 14.7 million registered voters would vote Tuesday or cast 
absentee ballots by then. The turnout in 1990, when Wilson defeated Feinstein 
for governor by 3.5%, was 58.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller attributed the projected increase -- in contrast to a record low 
turnout in the June primary -- to the vigorous campaign over Proposition 187, 
the petition measure that proposes to cut off state-financed health, education 
and social services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not since Proposition 13 on the ballot in the 1978 primary has there been 
this degree of engagement by voters on both sides of a measure," Miller said, 
referring to the property-tax cutting measure that rocked California politics 
and fiscal policy through the 1980s and into the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, a higher turnout helps Democrats. But Wilson campaign spokesman 
Dan Schnur said that interest in Proposition 187 was motivating as many 
supporters of the initiative -- mostly Republicans -- to go to the polls as 
opponents, who are mostly Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, the 49-year-old state treasurer, continued to tie her campaign closely 
to opposition of Proposition 187, which is backed by Wilson.  
</P>
<P>
 In appearances in San Diego and Sacramento, Brown described proponents of the 
measure as "those of narrow vision, those of mean spirit, those of short 
sights." 
</P>
<P>
 But by defeating the initiative, she said, "Californians have a chance on 
Tuesday to turn on the lights against the darkness of racial division, fear and 
intolerance." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown campaign also announced that two new campaign commercials ready to 
be aired Friday were being held over the weekend, apparently for lack of funds. 
The ads will run statewide Monday, spokesman John Whitehurst said, but he 
declined to say how often they would run or where. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown ads planned for today and Sunday on two major Los Angeles television 
stations were either canceled or pulled by the Brown campaign for lack of 
funds, the stations said. Schnur, the Wilson aide, said this was tantamount to 
running up a "white flag of surrender" in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown told reporters in Sacramento: "I am just fine. I have plenty of 
resources to carry me over the finish line victoriously. . . . If you notice in 
the polls, I am moving up in spite of the fact of being outspent by over $5 
million in the last three weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown cited a poll by KNBC-TV in Los Angeles that showed her closing to within 
4% of Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the results of a poll conducted for KCBS-TV and broadcast Thursday 
evening put Wilson on top by 18%. In both the major independent statewide 
surveys -- the Los Angeles Times Poll and the Field Poll conducted in late 
October -- Wilson led by 9% among likely voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson opened the day Friday by again demonstrating his ability to use his 
incumbency to complement his campaign. In his official role as governor, Wilson 
celebrated the reopening of the final segment of the giant Golden 
State-Antelope Valley Freeway interchange in the Newhall Pass that was severely 
damaged in the Northridge earthquake in January. 
</P>
<P>
 After the quake, political experts speculated on how long it would take the 
state to repair the damage and suggested that angry motorists backed up on 
detours in the first week in November might take out their frustration on the 
governor at the ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson ordered state highway officials to cut red tape in letting contracts 
and getting the damaged freeways reopened as soon as possible. Friday's 
ceremony marked completion of the job, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got government out of the way to expedite recovery," Wilson told about 200 
onlookers. While Wilson shared credit for fixing the freeways with the federal 
government, he also sneaked in an election-year plug on the California economy: 
"Unemployment is falling in California . . . and here in Los Angeles County, 
which has been hardest hit. That's because the people of this area refuse to 
take it lying down." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Brown and Feinstein welcomed Clinton to campaign for them in California. 
at the same time He has been shunned by some fellow Democrats engaged in tough 
election battles elsewhere in the country who felt that Clinton's unpopularity 
would rub off on them. According to the latest Field Poll, Clinton's popularity 
has been on the upswing in California, with 52% of those surveyed saying they 
liked him somewhat or a lot. This was up from 50% in polls in May and July.

<P>
 Later, Brown issued a statement saying that California in fact lost jobs 
during the last month and that jobs created during the period primarily were 
low-paying service positions and in the public sector.

 "That statement is a fraud and it comes from a phony," she said, referring to 
Wilson's talk of an economic comeback.

FEINSTEIN WORKER ENTERED U.S. LEGALLY, BUT VISA LAPSED; POLITICS: INS RECORDS 
INDICATE NO VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW. HUFFINGTON CONTINUES TO MAKE THE HIRING 
AN ISSUE. 
</P>

<P>
 After several wild days of accusations and retractions in the fiercely 
contested U.S. Senate race, the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
confirmed Friday that the woman employed by U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein as a 
housekeeper in the early 1980s entered the country with a legal work permit 
that expired while she was working for Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 The INS records suggested no violation of federal law by Feinstein, but show 
that the housekeeper apparently remained in the country illegally while working 
for Feinstein. The records also show that the woman's work visa limited her to 
working at the Guatemalan Consulate. 
</P>
<P>
 The records appeared to buttress claims by Feinstein that she did not hire an 
illegal immigrant and that the woman had some documentation -- a visa -- at the 
time of her employment. If the woman had presented that documentation to an 
employer, it would have been virtually impossible for anyone but an immigration 
expert to recognize the restrictions, an INS official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Republican challenger Mike Huffington left no doubt he would use 
the fact that the woman's work permit expired in November, 1980 -- and that she 
was technically eligible to work only at the consulate -- to continue to attack 
Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington had been on the defensive for more than a week after it was 
revealed that he and his wife had employed an illegal immigrant nanny until 
last year, apparently violating immigration and tax laws. Even though the 
circumstances of Feinstein's hiring in the early 1980s differed significantly 
from those of Huffington, the distinction was likely to be blurred in the final 
days of the bitter campaign that is the most expensive ever waged for a 
congressional seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The immigration issue was only one of a series of events in the Senate race 
Friday: 
</P>
<P>
 * In another sign of the race's volatility, KNBC-TV released a poll that 
showed Feinstein with a 16-point lead over Huffington, up 10 points from a poll 
two weeks ago. The 52%-36% margin came only days after another poll, done by a 
local television station, showed Huffington with a 2-point lead over Feinstein. 
KNBC attributed its results to Huffington's recent disclosure about employing 
an illegal immigrant for more than four years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Entering the last frantic weekend of campaigning, Feinstein traveled to 
several cities while Huffington concentrated on Los Angeles, with several 
television appearances. On a local cable television program, he called 
Feinstein a "hypocrite" and accused the INS of a "cover-up," though he offered 
no proof. 
</P>
<P>
 * Campaign disclosure reports showed that Huffington gave another $500,000 to 
his campaign, raising the total to nearly $28 million, which sets a national 
spending record for a congressional race. Feinstein loaned her campaign 
$70,000, bringing its total close to $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Associated Press asked the Huffington campaign to withdraw a new 
commercial attacking Feinstein because, the wire service said, it was quoted 
erroneously in the ad. The Huffington campaign refused the request. 
</P>
<P>
 The illegal immigrant accusations frustrated Feinstein's effort to draw 
attention to her record of bipartisan support in cities and counties. In news 
conferences in Fresno and Sacramento, she maintained that the woman she hired 
as a housekeeper in 1980 presented documentation showing that she was in the 
United States legally. Late in the day, her campaign also released W-2 
statements showing that Feinstein paid taxes and Social Security for the 
housekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaigning in Sacramento, Feinstein said: "Never in the history of this 
nation has there been a race like this where one person with no record and no 
performance . . . has spent so much to attack and slander." 
</P>
<P>
 Repeating a recent theme of her campaign, Feinstein implored her supporters to 
turn back Huffington's expensive campaign. "A Senate seat cannot be bought. A 
Senate seat must be earned. And the way you earn it is by performing," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein ended her day of campaigning with a rally at Los Angeles City Hall 
with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the INS disclosure Friday it was clear that Feinstein's hiring 
occurred long before the 1986 federal law that made it a crime to hire illegal 
immigrants. But throughout the day, Huffington accused Feinstein of lying about 
her former housekeeper's status and violating an obscure California labor law 
by hiring the housekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 The housekeeper was quoted by Associated Press on Friday as insisting she was 
in the country legally. "Yes, I was legal. I already talked with her 
(Feinstein) and I am not going to say anything more," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the San Francisco house where the woman now works as a housekeeper, her 
husband told The Times that she had entered the country legally and was 
permitted to work at the time she was employed by Feinstein. Miguel Realegeno 
disputed Huffington's ads saying that his wife was an illegal worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Kenney, an INS spokesman in Washington, said a woman identified as 
Annabella del Rosario Legrand-Cabrera Realegeno, 44, entered the United States 
on Nov. 17, 1979, on a one-year visa that allowed her to work for the 
Guatemalan Consulate in San Francisco. He said that visa was good until Nov. 
16, 1980 -- months after Feinstein has said she hired the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenney said INS records show that the woman's work authorization was limited 
to employment at the Guatemalan Consulate. But Kenney said it would have been 
very difficult for someone who was not an expert to determine what its 
limitations were. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the INS said the records did not suggest any violation of the law, 
the Huffington campaign said the information showed that Feinstein employed an 
illegal worker and that this constituted a violation of state law. 
</P>
<P>
 But the California labor code only prohibits an employer from "knowingly" 
hiring an illegal immigrant and nothing the Huffington campaign said on Friday 
undercut Feinstein's contention that she thought the woman had proper 
documentation when she hired her. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I've said, this was back in 1980, the person in question handed me 
documentation," Feinstein told reporters as she campaigned in Northern 
California. "It looked verifiable to me. And I hired her." 
</P>
<P>
 The Feinstein campaign called on television stations to stop running the 
Huffington ad on the issue, saying it was "potentially libelous." In a letter 
to the stations, campaign manager Kam Kuwata noted that Associated Press has 
challenged the accuracy of the ad. 
</P>
<P>
 Associated Press San Francisco bureau chief Dan Day, who faxed a letter of 
protest to the Huffington campaign Thursday night, said Friday the news service 
was asking that the ad be pulled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The erroneous information in your ad can substantially damage (Associated 
Press's) reputation. Please confirm to me that you will discontinue this 
misrepresentation of the AP's reporting," Day wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments this week: 
</P>
<P>
 * A Senate ethics complaint filed Friday contends that Feinstein would have 
personally benefited from her efforts to allegedly influence the Justice and 
Agriculture departments to drop 34 civil fraud suits against Sunkist Growers 
and its members. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein wrote officials this year, supporting dismissal of the 
whistle-blower suits, which seek $80 million to $400 million from Sunkist 
Growers for violating federal quotas on citrus shipments, the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint alleges that Feinstein held an interest in Newhall Land and 
Farming, which grows oranges and lemons for Sunkist -- based on Feinstein's 
1992 financial disclosure statement showing an investment of $500,000 to $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Her 1993 disclosure lists the investment at less than $1,000, however. Richard 
Blum, Feinstein's husband, said one of his partnerships divested the Newhall 
asset in September, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The ethics complaint was filed by James Moody, an attorney for Sequoia Orange 
Co., the firm that filed the whistle-blower suit against Sunkist. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethics experts said Feinstein's letters appear to fall within Senate rules. 
Hadley Roff, Feinstein's staff director in California, said her letters were 
proper. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department in September sought dismissal of the Sunkist case, 
despite having previously intervened on behalf of Sequoia. A spokesman said 
Feinstein's letter played no part in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 * State tax officials have questioned a former bookkeeper for the Huffington 
family as they opened a preliminary inquiry to determine if sales taxes of 
about $6,250 were paid on furnishings for the candidate's Montecito mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 The inquiry was prompted by the claim of bookkeeper Claudia Bratton that 
Huffington's wife, Arianna, purchased at least $100,000 worth of chairs, 
draperies and other items with a tax card issued to her sister, Agapi 
Stassinopoulos, by the State Board of Equalization. 
</P>
<P>
 The card allows interior designers to buy items from wholesalers without 
paying sales tax, if the goods are to be resold. But if the items are for 
personal use, the cardholder must pay the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Bratton's lawyer said his client is merely reporting what she saw while 
working for Arianna Huffington during several months in 1990. Jennifer 
Grossman, a spokeswoman for the Huffington campaign, denounced the assertions 
as "outrageous" and said Stassinopoulos had paid all the required sales taxes. 
Bryan G. Gaggs, an accountant who worked for Stassinopoulos, said he believes 
"all returns were filed on a timely basis, and that full compliance with 
California sales tax laws was effected."

BRITAIN; SCANDAL FIGURE CITES MORALITY AS MOTIVE; HARRODS MOGUL SAYS HE IS 
WATCHDOG. SOME SUGGEST EGYPTIAN IS GETTING EVEN FOR FAILED CITIZENSHIP BID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The man at the core of the so-called "sleaze scandal" that has shaken 
Britain's political Establishment is an unlikely player -- a self-designated 
keeper of government morals. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohamed Al Fayed, 61, is not even British. He's an Egyptian entrepreneur whose 
properties include London's most famous department store, Harrods, and Paris' 
equally celebrated Ritz Hotel. Both landmarks figure in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Fayed says he is offended by British ethical improprieties. That is why, he 
says, he has been leaking information about his dealings with politicians.  
</P>
<P>
 "I trust my intervention will be recognized as having brought only benefits to 
the way in which we conduct public life in this country," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 His revelations have forced three junior members of Prime Minister John 
Major's government to resign. A fourth, Treasury Chief Secretary Jonathan 
Aitken, has been under fire this week for the way he settled the bill for a 
two-night stay at the Ritz last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fayed's interest in British politics stems from his bitter battle in 1985 to 
take over Harrods' corporate parent, the House of Fraser retailing group, from 
Lonrho, a controversial international conglomerate run by Roland (Tiny) 
Rowland. 
</P>
<P>
 One big issue was whether Fayed had the cash necessary for the $1-billion 
buyout. He said that he had ample funds from a family fortune in cotton and 
shipping. Rowland challenged this, calling Fayed and his brothers "phony 
pharaohs." 
</P>
<P>
 Fayed hired public relations firms to leak anti-Rowland stories, and paid 
legislators to ask embarrassing questions in Parliament about Rowland. He also 
contributed about $400,000 to the coffers of the Conservative Party under 
then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. "When Margaret Thatcher wanted a favor 
from me," he later said, "I was there." 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation by the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed that Rowland was 
right: The Fayed family -- Mohamed, his brothers, Salah, 59, and Ali, 57 -- had 
no inherited wealth. Instead, they had made their money wheeling and dealing in 
various construction firms in Haiti, the Persian Gulf and Brunei.  
</P>
<P>
 The report concluded that the Fayeds had "dishonestly misrepresented their 
origins, their wealth, their business interests and their resources" during the 
takeover fight. But for reasons unexplained, the report was not made public 
until the Fayeds already had won the takeover tussle. Rowland's supporters said 
the delay was political. 
</P>
<P>
 When Fayed and his brother Ali sought British citizenship, the Home Office, 
the equivalent of an interior ministry, objected. Fayed reportedly was furious: 
He had contributed to the governing party, and now it was refusing him 
citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 He approached Prime Minister Major through an intermediary, saying he wanted 
the damaging Trade Ministry report about him to be withdrawn, and he repeated 
his wish for citizenship. But the approach came across, Major said a week ago, 
as blackmail: citizenship in exchange for not blowing the whistle on Tory 
politicians who had accepted Fayed's lavish hospitality. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Fayed charged that Aitken, who was then defense procurement 
minister, stayed at the Ritz for two days and allowed the bill to be paid by a 
fellow guest, a Saudi Arabian arms dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Egyptian added to the furor by exposing a ruse that the highly 
regarded editor of the Guardian, Peter Preston, had used to obtain a copy of 
Aitken's controversial bill at the Ritz. Preston authorized the forging of a 
fax under Aitken's parliamentary stationery to ask the Ritz for a copy. Furious 
Conservative members of Parliament clamored for Preston to be charged with 
forgery. 
</P>
<P>
 While some commentators have called for Fayed to be deported, others noted 
that many Britons seemed more inclined to share his outsider's view of the 
scandal than those of the Tory insiders in Major's government.

INDIA; BATTLE ROYAL STILL RAGES OVER A TRUE GEM OF A COLLECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It is the fabulous legacy of a king, said during his lifetime to be the 
world's richest man but who was so stingy he smoked cigarette butts left by his 
guests. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than two decades, India's government and the heirs of the Nizam of 
Hyderabad have been bickering over one of the world's most astonishing jewelry 
collections. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, three Supreme Court judges moved to end the dispute by giving the 
government until Dec. 31 to buy all 173 pieces for nearly $58 million. After 
that, the descendants of the most eccentric of the maharajahs will be free to 
seek their own buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The trove includes the 184.75-carat Jacob diamond, said to be the world's 
third-largest. The Nizam, a notorious miser who ruled a territory half as large 
as France, kept the priceless gem wrapped in a newspaper and used it as a 
paperweight. 
</P>
<P>
 Other items are a seven-strand necklace of 370 pearls, a pendant with a 
200-carat emerald drop, turban ornaments and buckles and armlets studded with 
diamonds and emeralds, some as large as pigeon eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Mir Osman Ali Khan, the seventh and last ruler in his Muslim dynasty, 
was such a skinflint that he wore the same battered, dirty fez for decades, he 
was willing to pay great sums for jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 A true connoisseur, this southern Indian potentate -- whose realm was annexed 
by force in 1948 by India -- acquired treasures from the Russian czars, 
including gold-tinged emeralds that one Paris-based jeweler called "simply out 
of this world." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the deposed ruler's death in 1967, the opulent collection has been the 
subject of court actions so tangled and prolonged that they support the 
contention that precious stones bring misery. 
</P>
<P>
 The mess began in 1972, when the numerous heirs, some of whom now live in 
penury, proposed the government acquire the whole collection. 
</P>
<P>
 The official Indian position has changed a few times but basically has been 
that all the stones, or the most remarkable among them, should stay in India. 
India's leaders, however, haven't had the cash to purchase them. 
</P>
<P>
 A Supreme Court-appointed mediator in 1991 gave the government eight weeks to 
pay up, failing which the heirs were to be able to seek another buyer. But both 
sides disagreed over price and terms, and the affair dragged on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our estimate is, in the market and sold abroad, all those pieces would fetch 
500 crores (5 billion rupees, or $160 million)," said Raian Karanjawala, a New 
Delhi attorney representing the Nizam's grandson, Prince Mukarram Jah, who 
lives on a half-million-acre sheep farm in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month's judgment ratified both the government's right of first refusal 
and a price the maharajah's descendants feel is far too low. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our stand in court was that the government shouldn't be allowed to purchase 
the jewels now because it took too long for them to make up their minds," 
Karanjawala said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gopalakrishnan Venketramani, cultural director of the Human Resource 
Development Ministry, says the ministry doesn't have the $58 million to buy the 
jewels. "It's not provided for in the budget," he said. "We'd have to go to 
Parliament while it was in session to get a supplementary grant." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the verdict, disagreement persists about the fate of any unbought 
pieces. Karanjawala said the judges ruled that "anything the government doesn't 
want, we are free to export." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, Venketramani said. "Under the Supreme Court judgment, anything deemed 
an antiquity is to remain in the country," the Indian official maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the glittering treasures that once gladdened a maharajah's flinty 
heart will remain inside the Bombay bank where they have been locked up for 
safekeeping.

BARRAGE OF CRITICISM PUTS CIA'S PREEMINENCE ON THE LINE; INTELLIGENCE: CRITICS 
SEE THE SPY AGENCY AS BEING UNABLE TO COPE WITH ITS OWN WEAKNESSES AND A 
CHANGING WORLD. WOOLSEY IS VIEWED AS LACKING LEADERSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the aftermath of the Aldrich H. Ames spy case, the U.S. intelligence 
community is increasingly embattled, criticized by current and former 
intelligence officials for failing to cope with its weaknesses and with a 
changing world.  
</P>
<P>
 Some even wonder whether the CIA will be able to hang on to its preeminent 
status after a half century of helping shape U.S. involvement in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, CIA Director R. James Woolsey appears to be in the deepest 
trouble of all the Clinton Administration's top foreign policy officials. Many 
insiders believe that he will be the first to go if President Clinton 
reshuffles his national security team after next week's midterm congressional 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community is very, very fragile right now," said a former ranking 
intelligence officer. "Until serious changes are made and Woolsey attacks the 
problem head on, U.S. intelligence faces hard times and the danger of being 
nibbled to death -- on the budget, Ames and its mission." 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey, who oversees all U.S. intelligence outlets, has won some of the CIA's 
fights, most notably in preventing further congressional cuts of the 
$28-billion intelligence budget. But he is losing the broader battle to reform 
and redefine intelligence goals and functions in the post-Cold War world, 
according to knowledgeable sources both inside and outside the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview this week, Woolsey defended himself and praised the CIA's 
roles in the recent Iraq, Haiti and North Korea crises. He also argued that the 
intelligence mission has been defined but is difficult for outsiders to grasp 
because it is more amorphous than in the Cold War era. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world we're in is one of a number of different and occasionally 
interacting intelligence challenges, several of which are quite deadly: 
international terrorism, rogue states, the potential for chaos -- all of which 
need to be addressed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 By tracking corruption and bribery in foreign business dealings, the CIA is 
even responsible for aiding U.S. business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The diversity of the mission and the need for flexibility in responding to it 
is dissatisfying to people who for 50 years have been involved in either a hot 
war or a cold war," Woolsey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the U.S. intelligence world is under fire. The analytical branches of 
U.S. intelligence still get high marks. Indeed, some in Washington believe that 
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein may even have bought Woolsey some extra time in 
the job because Baghdad's massing of troops on Kuwait's border was nipped in 
the bud, in part, through CIA warnings to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about demoralization inside the multifaceted U.S. intelligence community 
is now open and widespread. And symptomatic of the CIA's turmoil is the 
persistent problem of the ultra-secret wing of covert espionage, the 
Directorate of Operations, or so-called spy shop, which has defied control by 
either Woolsey or congressional oversight committees, according to insiders and 
former intelligence officials. 
</P>
<P>
 For these and other reasons, some contend that the CIA, in particular, no 
longer has the support or standing it enjoyed in earlier eras. 
</P>
<P>
 Stansfield Turner, the last CIA director to hold office during a Democratic 
Administration, said he believes that "the agency is much more beleaguered now 
than it was even after the Church committee revelations in 1975-76 or after the 
Iran-Contra hearings in 1987." 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate Intelligence Committee, then headed by Sen. Frank Church (D-Ida.), 
uncovered widespread CIA excesses, including the use of assassination against 
foreign leaders and illegal wiretapping and spying on Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner said that one of the agency's problems is the reluctance of its 
officials "to punish their own" but he acknowledged that the attitude "has been 
there since intelligence operations began." 
</P>
<P>
 As CIA director under then-President Jimmy Carter, Turner created an internal 
furor in the 1970s by sacking or retiring dozens of operatives and their 
managers. But the culture is so pervasive that the urge to circle the wagons 
when the CIA is under attack has persisted. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey has not been helped by the chorus of recent criticism, including this 
week's Senate report on the Ames case, which damns the CIA almost as much for 
the handling of that espionage debacle as for its laxity during the nine years 
Ames spied for Moscow. Ames, who pleaded guilty following his arrest in 
February, is serving a life sentence.  
</P>
<P>
 The report charged that Woolsey's handling of what was the most damaging CIA 
penetration in the nation's history was "seriously inadequate" on many fronts. 
</P>
<P>
 In a reflection of the deep divide between the CIA and Congress, Senate 
Intelligence Committee Chairman Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) said in an interview 
that Woolsey's efforts are not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't doubt he's making changes, but implementing them and having an 
enforcement capability are two different things," DeConcini said. "There's a 
history and a precedent at the CIA for good talk that isn't always followed up. 
We need to be convinced." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too late for him to turn it around," said Turner, the ranking former CIA 
official. "He's perceived as lacking leadership. And in Washington, perception 
often becomes the reality."

CANADA MOVES TO LIMIT IMMIGRATION; POLICY: THE SHIFT AWAY FROM GIVING PRIORITY 
TO RECENT ARRIVALS' FAMILY MEMBERS SIGNALS U-TURN BY GOVERNMENT.

 As Californians prepare to vote Tuesday on whether to cut off most public 
social services to illegal immigrants, an emotional debate is surging through 
Canada on a similar issue. 
</P>
<P>
 While illegal immigration is negligible in Canada, in recent years there has 
been a growing chorus of complaint that legal immigrants cost Canadian 
taxpayers too much in welfare and other social services. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Immigration Minister Sergio Marchi this week announced a drop in 
legal immigration levels for the coming year and a policy shift away from 
family unification and toward immigrants who bring with them sought-after work 
skills, personal wealth and an ability to speak English or French, Canada's 
official languages. 
</P>
<P>
 "The days when Canada required a large pool of unskilled labor are long gone," 
said Marchi in a report to Parliament. "Today the country needs people who are 
entrepreneurial, have good language skills and are able to adjust to a rapidly 
changing labor market. The criteria used to select immigrants must reflect this 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction was immediate and heated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real reason why people want to limit immigration is racism," said 
Emmanuel Dick, vice president of the Canadian Ethnocultural Council. "There is 
still the prevailing colonial mind-set in this country that 'real Canadians' 
are only those who are descended from British and French stock." 
</P>
<P>
 On the political right, the new policy was denounced as not going far enough. 
"Pure smoke and mirrors," pronounced Art Hanger, a member of Parliament from 
Calgary and spokesman for the conservative Reform Party, which has made 
restriction of immigration an integral part of its platform. 
</P>
<P>
 Marchi's announcement represents a political U-turn for the governing Liberal 
Party of Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who campaigned last year on pledges to 
hold immigration to recent levels and continue to give priority to family 
unification. 
</P>
<P>
 It also is laden with irony for Marchi, who arrived in Canada from Argentina 
at age 3 with his Italian-born parents. Marchi, 38, is fond of talking about 
how his father arrived in Canada with $40 and no English and found success. 
Asked by reporters whether his father would have made it into the country under 
the new rules, Marchi replied that times have changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada, the United States, Australia and Israel are the only nations that 
accept large numbers of legal immigrants. In recent years, Canada has set 
immigration levels at about 1% of the total population. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Americans, Canadians regard their country a land of opportunity and 
freedom for newcomers. But a backlash against immigration has been building in 
recent years, coinciding with an increase in immigration from Asia, a long, 
deep recession that is just ending and the arrest of immigrants in a few highly 
publicized crimes this year, mainly in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the criticism is directed against family unification, a program that 
allows recent arrivals to Canada to sponsor the immigration of family members, 
including adult children, parents and grandparents, on the promise that they 
will provide financial support. 
</P>
<P>
 Although statistics show that a smaller percentage of immigrants receives 
social assistance than the Canadian public at large, Marchi estimated that 
lapsed sponsorships cost Canada $700 million in social assistance to immigrants 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Marchi said the government will lower total immigration from a projected 
230,000 this year to between 190,000 and 215,000 in 1995. The family 
unification program will be directed more at spouses and minor children, and 
applicants will have to show that they can maintain a sponsorship, including 
perhaps posting a bond. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the rest of the decade, the government intends to reduce the percentage 
of family unification immigration from 51% to 44%. Immigrants admitted for 
economic reasons -- those with desired skills and capital -- will increase from 
43% to 53% over the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada will also increase the number of political refugees accepted next year 
from 24,000 to 32,000.  
</P>
<P>
 In what is becoming a trademark of the Chretien government, the policy change 
was announced after a long period of public hearings and study. Marchi said 
more than 10,000 Canadians were consulted in the process. Similar studies are 
under way on foreign policy and reform of social assistance programs. A review 
of defense policy also was just recently completed.

CHIRAC TO SEEK FRENCH PRESIDENCY 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Jacques Chirac declared his candidacy for president Friday, intensifying 
the kind of struggle on the right that led to a Socialist victory in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The bid intensifies a bitter duel between Chirac and Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur, both members of the conservative Rally for the Republic party, to 
represent the right in the two-round elections in April and May. 
</P>
<P>
 Balladur's enormous popularity since becoming prime minister in April, 1993, 
has eroded in recent weeks over scandals in his Cabinet and stubbornly high 
unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 Chirac, 61, is considered slightly more conservative than Balladur, 65. But 
both are likely to push ahead selling off state companies and trimming social 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Socialists are banking on rising voter discontent with unemployment, which 
rose 0.1% this week to 12.7%, and with scandals now claiming members of 
Balladur's Cabinet.

TAJIKS MOVE GRUDGINGLY TOWARD RECONCILIATION; EUROPE: HALF A MILLION PEOPLE WHO 
FLED A DEADLY WAR HAVE COME HOME; A TRUCE HOLDS. BUT TENSIONS SHROUD SUNDAY'S 
ELECTION.

 Two years after she was widowed and uprooted by war, Saipocho Kholikova 
returned here from a refugee camp and stood in the vine-covered portico of her 
home. Backed by escorts from the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees, she confronted a warrior of the victorious Kulyabi clan who had moved 
into the four-room house. 
</P>
<P>
 "They opened the gate and told him I am back and I would live here," Kholikova 
recalled, sitting cross-legged on the matted floor of her vacant living room. 
"They said they would come back and check on me." 
</P>
<P>
 The intruder didn't leave right away. Three of his relatives came around and 
-- in front of her two small children -- beat the frail, 45-year-old villager 
unconscious in her garden. They broke her windows. Confined in silence to one 
room, she shared the house with the man and his family for 10 weeks before they 
departed with her furniture, refrigerator, television set and carpets. 
</P>
<P>
 In this most devastating but esoteric of blood feuds on former Soviet 
territory, Kholikova's ordeal passes for progress toward peace. The harassment 
has stopped, she wrote recently to her four grown children in Afghanistan: 
"Come back, please. All is well." 
</P>
<P>
 Deep in Central Asia, Tajikistan is moving haltingly, grudgingly toward 
reconciliation. Half a million people who fled the war, including three-fourths 
of the 60,000 who camped in Afghanistan, have come home to partly destroyed 
towns and farm villages. A temporary cease-fire has been in force since Oct. 
20. 
</P>
<P>
 A land of poets with little tradition of war or exile, the place might well be 
Nowhere-istan. In a conflict overshadowed by that in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in 
some ways harder to fathom, Tajikistan's snow-capped peaks and cotton-growing 
valleys erupted with gunfire among ideological enemies and regional clans after 
the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In late 1992, Communist warriors of the Kulyabi clan, with tank support from 
the Russian army, drove an alliance of Islamists and democrats, along with 
their fighters of the Garmi and Pamiri clans, out of power and into 
Afghanistan. From there, they began low-intensity guerrilla raids. The war at 
its peak turned a 10th of the population into refugees. It has killed 20,000 
people and caused $7 billion in damage to what was already the poorest Soviet 
spinoff state. 
</P>
<P>
 The regime of Emamali S. Rakhmonov, a Kulyabi who once ran a collective cotton 
farm, has failed to consolidate its victory, the nation or any semblance of an 
economy, even with 25,000 Russian-led border troops and billions of Russian 
rubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the southern Kulyabis have fallen out with their wartime allies, the 
northern Khodzhent clan, which ran the republic in Soviet days. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarmed that the lingering insurgency could spread guns and drugs its way, 
Russia has coupled the military buildup in its neediest client state with 
pressure on Rakhmonov to make peace. 
</P>
<P>
 A growing cast of outsiders has reinforced this shift in Moscow's policy and 
broken Tajikistan's isolation. Jeeps emblazoned with the Red Cross and blue 
U.N. logos fan out on daily humanitarian and observer missions. Human Rights 
Watch/Helsinki monitors the regime's police methods. Diplomats from the United 
States, United Nations and Iran keep contact with warring factions. 
</P>
<P>
 The government last spring opened peace talks with the guerrilla-backed 
opposition. A U.N. observer mission has arrived to oversee the cease-fire and a 
promised exchange of 27 prisoners from each side. 
</P>
<P>
 But the whole process is fragile. In September, the government executed one 
condemned Islamic mullah on the opposition's original prisoner list and 
admitted the unexplained death of another. It has refused to legalize four 
exiled parties or drop treason charges against their leaders, who in turn 
refuse to recognize the legitimacy of Sunday's presidential election. A deputy 
prime minister died in a mine explosion the first day of the cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Refugees have benefited most from the foreign scrutiny, which has obliged 
Kulyabi warlords to disband their most brutal gangs. Paramilitary thugs have 
been quietly sent to Russia for training in the army, making it safer for 
Garmis and Pamiris to come home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government has become more or less civilized," said Oinikhol 
Bobonazarova, a leader of the opposition Democratic Party in Dushanbe, the 
Tajik capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence that killed 15 returning refugees last year abated after the two most 
powerful Kulyabi warlords, Sangak Safarov and Faizulli Saidov, shot each other 
dead. Saidov, so fearsome that southerners still fall silent at the mention of 
his name, bitterly opposed repatriation. 
</P>
<P>
 And the harassment died down further after Pierre-Francois Pirlot, a Frenchman 
who heads the U.N. refugee mission in Dushanbe, gave a scolding lecture on 
Tajik television last fall. He visited the camps to coax reluctant refugees to 
return, hooking them up by field radio to reassuring relatives back home. 
</P>
<P>
 Tajik officials at all levels now endorse repatriation as smart 
counterinsurgency. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't have quiet lives here as long as one of them is across the river in 
Afghanistan," said Safar Khalimov, a former warlord who is deputy mayor of this 
southern farming region and helps returnees get land and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But in nearby villages populated by Garmis, young men are scarce. Garmis and 
Kulyabis live too close for comfort, and many Kulyabis are still armed, so the 
Garmis who fought them -- or might be suspected of having done so -- stay away. 
Still, their mothers and young siblings are coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 On a collective farm called Communism, Garmi war widow Guljon Bukhoriyeva had 
just returned to her mud-brick home. The roof was gone, along with her four 
cows, but squash grew in the garden. Two years after leaving, she put a 
borrowed roof over one of her three rooms and moved in. 
</P>
<P>
 As she greeted visitors, her three young children pushed dry weeds into a 
mud-oven fire. Kulyabi neighbors have welcomed her back, she said, but her 
three grown children are staying "in another part of Tajikistan." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a true success story," Pirlot said of the repatriation. "But my fear 
is, 'Is it going to last?' The effort we've made to rebuild things wouldn't 
stand a chance if the hard-liners decided to go at it again." 
</P>
<P>
 That could happen as long as the welcome mat does not extend to opposition 
leaders, who speak for 5,000 guerrillas. In the peace talks, the government 
insists on having the election Sunday without them; the opposition wants a 
council of neutral statesmen, appointed by both sides, to rule for two years, 
disarm everyone, then hold elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrillas have stepped up attacks in recent months, assassinating a deputy 
defense minister and seizing or killing 53 government soldiers in a single 
raid. 
</P>
<P>
 "These elections will not help the cause of peace," exiled Tajik 
poet-politician Davlat Khudonazarov told a recent U.S. congressional hearing. 
"They will be held in an environment where tens of thousands of people are 
running around with guns in their hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the exclusion of opposition parties, the Council for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe has rejected the government's invitation to monitor the 
election.  
</P>
<P>
 But American and Russian diplomats support it, and at least some of them pin 
hope on Rakhmonov's only rival, his former prime minister, Abdulmalik A. 
Abdulajanov. A wealthy businessman of the Khodzhent clan, he is viewed as more 
conciliatory. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdulajanov, 45, accuses Rakhmonov of adopting "a totalitarian mentality," 
preparing ballot fraud and spreading the threat of armed resistance if the 
ruling clan is voted out. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Rakhmonov, 42, is appealing to the hostile and the conciliatory 
instincts at play. At a recent campaign rally, a local military commander got 
up and declared that "this is my country and I'll never give it away to the 
opposition." 
</P>
<P>
 But when Rakhmonov spoke, he pondered aloud why so many Tajiks had killed each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still brothers," he said.

POPE BLASTS MAFIA IN WEEKEND SICILY VISIT; ITALY: JOHN PAUL URGES CITIZENS TO 
'RISE UP' AGAINST ORGANIZED CRIME. THE TRIP WILL TEST HIS RECOVERY FROM A LEG 
INJURY IN APRIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Inveterate traveler Pope John Paul II went back on the road Friday, launching 
a barnstorming weekend through Sicily that promises to be a test for his 
slow-healing leg and a trial for the Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Catania, rise up and cloak yourself in light and justice," the Pope urged 
Friday night in a strong-voiced opening sally against organized crime at a 
meeting with citizens in front of a cathedral that was begun 900 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 History's highest-mileage Pope flew to Catania from Rome on a muggy, hazy 
evening to keep a promise. He had planned to visit at the end of April but 
broke his right leg in a bathroom fall at his Vatican apartment the night 
before he was to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Mounted anew on his Popemobile on Friday, he waved to happy crowds lining the 
streets of this prosperous but Mafia-beset port city overlooked by the brooding 
mass of Mt. Etna, Europe's biggest volcano. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too often and for too long the children of this community have suffered the 
humiliation of being written off as residents of a decayed and violent city, 
dominated by organized crime and made unlivable," the Pope thundered. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul brought an appeal for action on his first call in Catania and his 
first in Sicily since May, 1993, when he lambasted the Mafia in one of the 
strongest addresses of his papacy. 
</P>
<P>
 With a large and friendly crowd cheering his every move Friday, the 
74-year-old pontiff returned immediately to the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "My thoughts are with your community on its difficult and tiring road to moral 
and social growth, hoping to find a new harmony, leaving behind the forms of 
suffocation and corruption manipulated by some at the expense of many," he told 
Sicilians. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope dismisses organized crime, a stubborn and deeply rooted fact of 
Sicilian life, with the scorn he reserves for issues such as abortion and 
euthanasia. Silence will not do, the Pope says. He demands that Sicilians rise 
up in active opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time is running out and does not allow inert waiting or timorous mediocrity," 
he said in a speech based on Christ's biblical response to a cripple who asked 
for help: "Rise up and walk." 
</P>
<P>
 It was John Paul's first venture beyond Vatican walls since he canceled an 
October visit to the United States to allow further time for recuperation. 
Since then, he has worked a full load as an administrator but skipped a number 
of scheduled pastoral events that would have kept him on his feet for extended 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving in Catania on an Italian air force executive jet, John Paul descended 
the steep nine steps from the plane with fierce concentration, grasping 
handrails in both hands and placing both feet on each step, one deliberate 
shuffle after another. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul's Sicilian visit has been pruned to accommodate his leg. He will say 
Mass here this morning and, after a fairly relaxed day, will journey to the 
ancient city of Syracuse, where he will dedicate a shrine Sunday before 
returning that night to Rome.

 President Boris N. Yeltsin appointed a former Soviet bureaucrat, once charged 
with bribery, to be his new finance minister Friday, a move that startled 
economic reformers and prompted one of them, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander N. 
Shokhin, to announce his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment of Vladimir Panskov, 50, to head the Finance Ministry and 
other recent Cabinet shifts have created an air of uncertainty about Yeltsin's 
reform program.The three senior economic officials with whom the West had been 
dealing have all been fired or left the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Panskov, 50, told the Russian news agency Interfax on Friday that he favors 
the current program of tight controls on expenditures. But he sounded skeptical 
that the government could meet the requirements of its tough 1995 budget, drawn 
up in consultation with the International Monetary Fund.

SOUTH KOREA SAYS SLIM CHANCE HACKER STOLE NUCLEAR SECRETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The South Korean atomic energy institute said Friday that there is a slim 
possibility a teen-age British computer hacker stole secret nuclear data from 
its computer system. 
</P>
<P>
 The Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, or KAERI, said it was 
investigating possible damage to its system after a report in the Washington 
Times newspaper Thursday that said the hacker managed to access it recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times report quoted James Christy, director of computer crime 
investigation at the U.S. Air Force's office of special investigations. He 
spoke at a conference on global organized crime convened by Washington's Center 
for Strategic and International Studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Christy said the 16-year-old youth using the name Data Stream got into the 
system and more than 100 others after penetrating the computer at the Rome Air 
Development Center at Griffith Air Force Base in Rome, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said British police found the boy, who was not identified, sitting 
in front of his computer screen when they raided his house, and he curled up 
into a fetal position and cried when he realized they had come to arrest him. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korean media quoted KAERI officials as saying there is a good chance a 
hacker could have infiltrated its system because it was connected to the 
worldwide Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the officials said confidential information such as that on reactor 
systems and fuel rod design was stored separately from other data and protected 
by multiple passwords.

MINOR TROUBLE BRIEFLY HAMPERS SATELLITE RELEASED BY SPACE SHUTTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A gleaming, triangular satellite released by the crew of the space shuttle 
Atlantis on Friday sped around Earth sampling ozone and other atmospheric gases 
after ground controllers corrected its aim. 
</P>
<P>
 The German satellite barely had begun observations when sunlight blinded a 
navigation unit on the craft, causing a telescope cover to slam shut. At the 
same time, the unit could not lock onto stars to point the spacecraft's 
telescopes because its field of view was too narrow. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble occurred when Atlantis and the satellite were out of radio 
contact, and about 17 miles apart, said mission manager Konrad Moritz. The two 
spacecraft are routinely out of contact for hours at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as Atlantis and the satellite were back in contact, ground controllers 
sent up new pointing commands. It worked: The telescope door quickly reopened 
and observations resumed. 
</P>
<P>
 About two hours of data were lost. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the seven atmospheric and solar-energy monitors aboard Atlantis also 
ran into trouble -- the data link between a German ozone monitor and ground 
controllers was lost Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. and European monitors began observations Thursday evening, just hours 
after Atlantis lifted off. 
</P>
<P>
 The satellite release -- one of the crew's primary jobs in orbit -- went 
perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
 French astronaut Jean-Francois Clervoy unlatched the satellite from the end of 
Atlantis' robot arm as the shuttle soared 190 miles above northern Europe. Then 
commander Donald McMonagle slowly backed the shuttle away. 
</P>
<P>
 Clervoy released the 7,500-pound satellite so gently that German ground 
controllers didn't detect any spin by the satellite and nervously called 
Mission Control to find out what was wrong. They were assured all was well. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers are controlling the satellite from the Kennedy Space Center during 
its eight days of free flight. The six-member crew will retrieve the satellite 
next Saturday for the trip home. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the two-hour interruption, the infrared telescopes on the satellite 
continued measuring up to 14 atmospheric gases per second, in three directions 
at once. Scientists hope to analyze these gases and their chemical reactions 
between seven miles and 70 miles high. 
</P>
<P>
 The $35-million satellite also holds an ultraviolet instrument to measure 
atmospheric gases responsible for ozone damage. Robert Conway, a scientist at 
the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, was ecstatic with the early data. 
He began working on the instrument in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long time, and I'm very excited," Conway said. "It looks 
fabulous."

 Test-tube experiments at a National Institutes of Health laboratory show 
evidence that a drug called hydroxyurea may block or slow the replication of 
the AIDS virus, researchers report. In a study published in the journal 
Science, researchers at the National Cancer Institute report that HIV, which 
causes AIDS, is unable to reproduce in cells exposed to hydroxyurea, a cancer 
drug that has been used for 30 years. Scientists cautioned that tests that show 
promise in the lab have sometimes proven disappointing in human patients but 
they were still excited about the potential in this case.

INTEREST GROUPS FIRING UP THE ELECTORATE; POLITICS: ACTIVISTS WORK PHONES, 
DISTRIBUTE LITERATURE IN UNPRECEDENTED EFFORT TO GET OUT THE VOTE. THEY ARE 
MOTIVATED BY HIGH-STAKES RACES.

 Hoping to persuade the cynical and move the faithful to action, activists 
within the Christian Coalition are passing out 33 million voter guides to 
elections from coast to coast and hope to make 2 million phone calls for their 
candidates by the Tuesday election. 
</P>
<P>
 In several states, the AFL-CIO's phone banks are now humming day and night and 
environmental advocates are working side by side with favored candidates' 
workers in a handful of races considered crucial for their cause. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is anything more frenzied than the candidates in the final days 
before this midterm election, it is the bevy of interest groups that, for a 
variety of reasons, are investing more, working harder and getting more 
directly involved than ever before, political experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a "super blitz," says John Myers, a Philadelphia political organizer. 
"I've done get-out-the-vote efforts on two other occasions but never to this 
extent." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the intense interest is that the stakes are exceptionally high 
this year -- with the Republicans hoping to capitalize on voter anger and seize 
an outright majority in the Senate and at least working control, if not a 
numerical majority, in the House. Those possibilities have given energy to 
voters on the right far more than on the left, however, forcing many liberal 
political organizations to scramble to create interest and boost turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 In broader terms, many organizations see the 1994 contest as a pivotal point 
in a struggle for the soul of government and the values of American society. 
</P>
<P>
 "Attacks on religious conservatives by Democratic candidates and even the 
Clinton Administration have been so virulent that it is energizing and driving 
religious conservatives to the polls," said Mike Russell, spokesman for the 
Christian Coalition, which is based in Chesapeake, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side, Arthur J. Kropp, president of People for the American Way 
Action Fund, a Washington-based liberal organization, said that the "Christian 
Coalition and its allies are working to be the nuts and bolts of the Republican 
Party. From that position they will shape GOP ideology, strategies and 
candidate selection for years to come." 
</P>
<P>
 For conservative organizations, the election is the payoff for two years of 
vigorous work that began when President Clinton was elected. 
</P>
<P>
 "In an off-year election, typically you see a lot of voter apathy," Russell 
said. "But this time around our constituency is energized because we have been 
so insulted and marginalized as a segment of the population that shouldn't be 
heard." 
</P>
<P>
 As added insurance, he said, the coalition is spending at least $1 million to 
publish and distribute by hand its voter's guide. Another $1 million may be 
spent on its phone banks between now and Election Day.  
</P>
<P>
 Many groups on the left are hustling double-time to offset such conservative 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Smith, executive director of Boston-based Green Vote and a longtime 
liberal political fund-raiser, said that, even before this election cycle, 
conservative groups like the Christian Coalition have demonstrated a mastery of 
the political end game by burying the opposition with money and literature in 
the closing days of campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many progressive activists and donors prefer to work on policy and show 
disdain for the real work of electing politicians," he said. "The right wing 
understands that politics in the United States is policy" so they work harder 
in the final day to get their people in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest groups on the left are fearful because many Democratic voters this 
year seem less interested in the election. Myers, for example, has expanded the 
traditional drive to boost voter turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually we did the super blitzes only on Election Day but, because so many 
people are apathetic or don't seem focused on the issues or candidates, we felt 
it was necessary to make our efforts more repetitive," he said. He said that he 
has organized 10 teams of 14 people to visit bus stops and major transit 
points, knock on doors and display posters all aimed at persuading people to 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 In several states, AFL-CIO volunteers are telephoning union members to urge 
them to support candidates endorsed by their state labor organizations, said 
Candice Johnson, a spokeswoman in the organization's Washington office. 
</P>
<P>
 Some organizations are lending support directly to individual campaigns. For 
example, Stephanie H. Sanchez, an environmental fellow for the League of 
Conservation Voters, has joined the campaign for Jim Maloney, a four-term 
Democratic state senator seeking to unseat GOP Rep. Gary Franks in 
Connecticut's 5th Congressional District. 
</P>
<P>
 "The league placed me in this campaign," she said. "Our mission is to elect 
pro-environmental candidates."

 A tugboat skipper pleaded guilty to negligence charges for letting a barge run 
aground in January, spilling nearly 800,000 gallons of oil into the Atlantic 
Ocean off Puerto Rico.As Roy McMichael entered the plea in U.S. District Court 
in San Juan, the U.S. Coast Guard issued a report concluding he shared blame 
for the spill, which has cost at least $86 million to clean up. The barge ran 
aground on reefs off the coast of San Juan that ripped open its tanks. More 
than 600,000 gallons spilled in the first few days. The rest spilled when the 
Coast Guard pulled it off the reef and then sank it north of Puerto Rico.

FLORIDA MOTHER'S KIDNAP TALE REPLACED BY A MURDER CHARGE

<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman who gave a gripping TV account of her 7-year-old daughter's purported 
abduction was charged Friday with murder after her husband's arrest on the same 
count. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauline Zile was arrested at her lawyer's office in Stuart, Fla., a day after 
she appeared at a news conference and was described as a battered wife, 
dominated and threatened by husband John Zile. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauline Zile, 24, was charged with first-degree murder and one count of 
aggravated child abuse. The battered body of her daughter, Christina, was found 
buried on Oct. 27 after her husband led police to the grave north of West Palm 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Sobbing on television, Pauline Zile told of how Christina was abducted from a 
Ft. Lauderdale flea market restroom on Oct. 22. She pleaded for the girl's 
return but kept referring to Christina in the past tense. There were other 
inconsistencies in her story and police later found traces of blood in the 
couple's car and apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ziles told police they concocted the abduction tale to cover up the girl's 
death in mid-September at the hands of John Zile. 
</P>
<P>
 Pauline Zile told police he beat Christina to death when she wouldn't stop 
crying in their apartment. John Zile, 32, confessed after learning that his 
wife had talked about the death, according to a police affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
 John Zile is in jail on charges of first-degree murder and two counts of 
aggravated child abuse, for two alleged previous beatings of Christina. He and 
his wife are being held without bond.

GOP TRIES APING THE WHITMAN SOLUTION; CAMPAIGN: CANDIDATES ACROSS COUNTRY ARE 
PUSHING N.J. GOVERNOR'S TAX CUT PLAN. THEY SEEK TO BENEFIT FROM THE EARLY 
SUCCESS OF HER ECONOMIC POLICIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps the best evidence of New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's 
emergence as a national political force came this week when she became the 
target of an orchestrated campaign attack by a Democratic gubernatorial 
candidate -- in Maryland.  
</P>
<P>
 Maryland Democrat Parris Glendening is running hard against a woman who styles 
herself a "Christie Whitman Republican," promising to copy the New Jersey chief 
executive's enormously popular state economic policies, which are highlighted 
by steep income tax cuts. Recently, Glendening invited five New Jersey 
residents to a press conference to warn Maryland voters of nightmarish 
budgetary consequences for their state should they choose a Whitman clone. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Maryland race, this fall's elections in many states are turning to a 
remarkable degree into a referendum on the economic policies of New Jersey's 
first woman governor -- who narrowly defeated incumbent James J. Florio last 
year on a promise of tax and spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is whether the Whitman-style mix of immediate tax cuts and longer 
term spending reductions offers a formula for a Republican revival in the 
1990s, or will boomerang into a repeat of budget-busting "trickle-down" Ronald 
Reagan economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, however, Whitman and her policies have proved hugely popular in her 
state and the 48-year-old governor is in constant demand as a speaker and 
fund-raiser for Republican candidates all across the nation, from Senate 
candidate Olympia J. Snowe in Maine to Gov. Pete Wilson in California. In fact, 
GOP operatives are already touting her as a potential vice presidential 
candidate in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Her success so far has prompted shameless copying of her economic agenda by 
Republican candidates in one state after another in this election season. In 
the process, she has helped put cutting taxes back at the top of the Republican 
agenda, helping the party move beyond the debacle of candidate George Bush's 
failure to live up to his "read my lips" pledge not to raise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, for example, Republican George Pataki is challenging Gov. Mario 
M. Cuomo with a Whitman-style tax cut platform, while tax cuts are at the heart 
of the gubernatorial campaigns of David Beasley in South Carolina, Frank 
Keating in Oklahoma and Ellen Sauerbrey in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitman's success also has bolstered the Republican commitment to make 
promises of steep tax cuts at the federal level a central element of the 
party's campaign to win control of Congress as well. More than 300 Republican 
candidates have signed onto a controversial "contract with America," which 
calls for a wide range of personal and business tax cuts, including a $500 per 
child tax credit, tax relief for married couples, expanded individual 
retirement accounts and a 50% cut in the capital gains tax for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 More broadly, the popularity of Whitman's economic agenda has underscored once 
again for the Republican Party that the winning formula for political victory 
is being fashioned at the state level by a new breed of moderate Republican 
governors -- rather than in Washington. Whitman has joined John Engler in 
Michigan, William F. Weld in Massachusetts and Tommy G. Thompson in Wisconsin 
as leaders in an attempt to give new energy to their party. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are doing here is what other Republican governors have been trying to 
do around the country in the last couple of years. I just may have defined the 
agenda a little more clearly and moved it more rapidly," Whitman observed in a 
recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitman owes her high approval ratings in large part to her unique mix of 
conservative fiscal policy and liberal social agenda, highlighted by her stance 
in favor of abortion rights, thus offering what she hopes is a model for 
dominance by the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 More concretely, though, she has begun to carry out her most controversial 
promise of the 1993 campaign. After pledging to cut income taxes by 30% over 
three years, she has pushed through a 15% tax cut in her first year in office. 
</P>
<P>
 But many analysts said that they believe her politically popular tax cuts 
represent a ticking fiscal time bomb that will lead to budgetary disaster for 
New Jersey -- and political disaster for Whitman -- raising questions about 
whether her policies really offer a solid model for her party. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Whitman's aides conceded that a huge budgetary shortfall in a state with 
a balanced-budget law may mean that she will not be able to cut taxes again 
next year. That could force her to seek another huge tax cut at the end of her 
term, if she is to live up to her campaign pledge. And that could force her to 
indulge in bookkeeping sleight of hand or other gimmicks to make the budgetary 
math work. State Treasurer Brian Clymer already is scrambling to find ways to 
cover a deficit that could reach $2 billion next year in a budget that totals 
just $15.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "This next budget is going to be the toughest," acknowledged Whitman. "But 
really, the next three or four budgets are all going to be very tough."  
</P>
<P>
 What's more, economists and political analysts said that her policies already 
are putting pressure on local governments to sharply increase property taxes to 
offset shortfalls in state aid for schools and municipalities. 
</P>
<P>
 State funds account for about 30% of municipal budgets around the state. 
Although local property taxes have risen at a slightly slower pace in 1994 than 
they did in the last year of the Florio administration, analysts said that they 
expect the pressure to increase next year, when Whitman almost certainly will 
be forced to cut state aid to cities and towns to balance her budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a direct correlation in New Jersey between state income tax revenues 
and local property tax rates and so people in this state are going to have an 
opportunity to see the trade-offs that have to be made as a result of her 
income tax cuts," argued Florio, now an attorney in private practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "New Jersey has suffered under tax rates that are too high but the problem is 
she is conducting a tax shift rather than a tax decrease," added Rep. Robert G. 
Torricelli (D-N.J.), who is considering a run against Whitman in 1997. "She has 
reduced income taxes and that will put pressure on state aid to towns and 
schools and that will put pressure on property taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitman dismissed such dire warnings, arguing that there is no direct link 
between income taxes and property taxes, even though local aid by the state 
represents a huge chunk of the New Jersey budget. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Whitman was able to take a series of relatively painless actions to 
pay for her first round of tax cuts, while still presenting a balanced budget. 
Florio insisted that he left Whitman a $400-million budget surplus, which acted 
as a down payment on tax relief. In addition, Whitman came up with about $1.3 
billion by reducing state contributions to the state employee pension fund and 
the state employee health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitman said that those trust funds remain fully funded and that the state was 
previously putting too much money into them. Democrats and employee unions 
charged that she is eroding their financial stability, which will lead to 
higher state payments or reduced pension and health benefits in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Those actions allowed Whitman to avoid severe cuts in the state budget this 
year and to enact $600 million in income and business tax cuts while reducing 
spending by just $200 million. State aid to municipalities and school districts 
was frozen, but overall was not reduced. One of the only spending cuts that has 
had a direct impact on voters came with her elimination of a state fund that 
helped stabilize tuitions at state colleges. With the fund in place in 1993, 
state tuitions rose an average of 3.6%. This fall, tuitions rose more than 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 State analysts said they doubt that Whitman can continue to find enough easy 
savings to avoid far more painful choices in her next budget, due in February.  
</P>
<P>
 She must find at least $1.4 billion to cover another looming deficit next 
year, not counting the $480-million costs for fiscal 1996 that she would incur 
if she cut income taxes another 15% next year. What's more, Whitman faces the 
huge potential costs of complying with a New Jersey Supreme Court order for the 
equalization of state educational funding.  
</P>
<P>
 So as she scrambles behind closed doors to craft a new budget, most New Jersey 
Democrats are patiently waiting to see what she does. 
</P>
<P>
 "In her first year . . . she was able to defer the downside of her policies," 
argued Henry Raimondo, a professor of public policy at the Eagleton Institute 
at Rutgers University. "The question now is, does she have any more rabbits to 
pull out of her hat?" Profile: Christine Todd Whitman

AS VOTE NEARS, NUMBERS ARE POLLS APART; POLITICS: CONTRADICTORY RESULTS RAISE 
QUESTIONS ABOUT RELIABILITY. EXPERTS ADVISE READERS AND VIEWERS TO STUDY 
SURVEYS' TRACK RECORDS. 
</P>

<P>
 In the final days of the 1994 campaign, an array of contradictory polls -- 
with results as much as 15 points apart and different candidates ahead -- 
reveals some alarming truths about the reliability of such surveys and offers a 
sharp warning about media coverage of politics, pollsters conceded Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of polls, many sponsored by news organizations, has mushroomed in 
recent years. And even in the most competent hands, polls are not as reliable 
as media portrayals would suggest -- especially political "horse race" polls 
that measure only which candidate is ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, many Americans fail to grasp such basics of polling as the 
"margin of error," a statistical measure in which a 10-point lead can be the 
same thing as a dead heat. 
</P>
<P>
 All this makes readers and viewers vulnerable to a confusing buffet of 
numbers. Consider that: 
</P>
<P>
 * In Pennsylvania's closely watched Senate race, Democratic incumbent Harris 
Wofford leads Republican challenger Rick Santorum by five points in one poll. 
But he trails by 10 in another. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Michigan's U.S. Senate race, Republican Spencer Abraham is ahead of 
Democrat Bob Carr by six to 10 points in two polls but behind by one point in a 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 * In California, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein leads Rep. Mike Huffington 
by 10 points in a KCAL-TV poll and trails by two in a KCBS-TV poll. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nationwide, an ABC/Washington Post "generic party" poll shows that the 
country is tilting toward the Democrats on Tuesday, with 48% of Americans 
saying they intend to vote for the Democratic Party in their local 
congressional campaigns while 45% favor Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 But a CBS/New York Times poll finds that the country is tilting Republican, 
49% to 45%. 
</P>
<P>
 What is a reader or viewer to think? 
</P>
<P>
 One guide, pollsters said, is to watch to see if the poll is conducted by the 
campaign itself. In recent years, the number of polls done by campaigns has 
exploded and many are not reliable, according to veteran California pollster 
Mervin Field. 
</P>
<P>
 These polls tend to be conducted quickly and cheaply and generally are not 
designed to find precise horse race numbers as much as general trends, said 
Washington Post pollster Richard Morin. And frankly, Morin added, campaigns 
often lie about the results. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these numbers are released for our benefit," he said, to try to 
impress journalists and alter press coverage. "And these campaigns have two 
sets of books." 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor is the rising number of polls in general, particularly those 
taken by media outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Technology has made bad polling easier," said CBS pollster Kathy Frankovic. 
"This business used to require statistical expertise and expensive computers. 
Today you can buy a voter sample, a computer program and run it on a PC and get 
yourself a package that allows 10 people with phones to do the poll." 
</P>
<P>
 One suggestion for separating good polls from bad is to rely on those by 
familiar sources who have been polling for years. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, for instance, the Field Poll and the Los Angeles Times Poll 
have long track records for accuracy. The same is true nationally of the 
network news polls and the Gallup Poll. Another indicator is whether a poll is 
done in connection with a university, which would subject its methods to 
academic peer review.  
</P>
<P>
 A common-sense piece of advice is to compare poll results and throw out those 
that do not conform. For instance, three polls now show Feinstein ahead by six 
to 10 points in California -- the Field, Times and KCAL surveys. Only the one 
taken for KCBS-TV shows Huffington leading, and the same pollster has recorded 
similar anomalous results in a Michigan race. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if all of that advice is followed, the public should still proceed 
with caution -- especially when looking at so-called "horse race" polls. One 
major reason is the difficulty in determining which of the people polled should 
be counted because they will actually vote on Election Day and which should be 
ignored because they are unlikely to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nasty little secret of the polling business is that this so-called likely 
voter definition is just an educated guess," said Los Angeles Times pollster 
John Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
 Every pollster has a different way of defining likely voters, Brennan said. 
Some base it on past voting behavior, which can undercount young voters. Some 
just ask a few questions. Others have elaborate screens, including demographics 
and knowledge of the political race. 
</P>
<P>
 Other factors can also alter a poll's results: 
</P>
<P>
 * Is the pollster choosing respondents from a master list of voters or from 
the phone book? Each has advantages but will render a different pool of 
callers. 
</P>
<P>
 * How often do the pollsters call back if there is no answer? If they do not 
call back two or three times at the minimum, pollsters said, they are likely to 
undercount young people and the affluent and overcount people more likely to be 
home -- those with young children and the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 * What is the race or accent of the person asking the questions, particularly 
if the political contest has a racial dynamic such as the battle over 
Proposition 187 in California? 
</P>
<P>
 * How are questions worded? For example, one reason the "generic party" poll 
results are at odds, according to Frankovic, is that different organizations 
ask different questions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Are the respondents aware of the political world? Only 30% of the public can 
even name a congressman from their state, Frankovic said. 
</P>
<P>
 All of those problems are subtle and much more difficult to measure than the 
frequently cited "margin of error," a calculation that counts only the 
statistical probability of accuracy based on the number of people interviewed.

CLINTON AIDES TO LEAD NEW EFFORT ON HEALTH CARE REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two of President Clinton's top aides, Robert E. Rubin and Carol Rasco, will 
lead the effort next year for health care reform, Rubin said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin heads the White House National Economic Council and Rasco is domestic 
policy adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Ira Magaziner, architects of this year's 
failed reform bid, will continue to play important roles in strategy, policy 
and public relations on health care, Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rubin said the reform effort would be moved to a "regular policy process" 
now that much of the foundation for health care reform has been established by 
the First Lady and Magaziner. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin said plans for reviving health care reform next year were in the early 
stages, but that meetings were already being held to consider the most sensible 
approach.

MAJORITY OF HOUSE MEMBERS EXPECTED TO WIN REELECTION; POLITICS: DESPITE VOTERS' 
ANTI-INCUMBENT MOOD, FEW SITTING LAWMAKERS WILL BE TURNED OUT, EXPERTS SAY. 
EVEN THOSE FACING CRIMINAL INDICTMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Call them the Indicted but Still Favored Few. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the antipathy toward Congress nationwide, voters in Illinois, 
California and Pennsylvania may well reelect three lawmakers whose ultimate 
fates will hang on yet another verdict. Reps. Mel Reynolds (D-Ill.), Walter R. 
Tucker III (D-Compton) and Joseph M. McDade (R-Pa.) have the unsavory 
distinction of being on next week's ballot while also being under indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth legislator under indictment, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), was also 
considered a shoo-in for reelection before a final Republican push suggested 
that his race may be tougher than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The nature of the four congressmen's alleged crimes makes their electoral 
viability even more striking: Reynolds is charged with 20 counts of sexual 
assault, child pornography, aggravated sexual abuse of a child and obstruction 
of justice. Tucker was indicted on 10 counts of extortion and income tax 
evasion and McDade on five counts of racketeering, conspiracy and accepting 
illegal gratuities. Rostenkowski, whose name has become nearly synonymous with 
the House Post Office scandal, faces trial on 17 counts of embezzlement, fraud 
and witness-tampering. 
</P>
<P>
 The political resilience of this bipartisan quartet illustrates a 
little-noticed phenomenon of this campaign: Despite all the turnover expected 
in Congress, most incumbents seeking reelection to the House are likely to win. 
 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 44 face no major party opposition. Another 118 have opponents who 
had spent less than $25,000 by mid-October in largely token campaigns. And all 
seven Louisiana lawmakers seeking reelection are already assured return trips 
to Capitol Hill because they received more than 50% of the vote in the state's 
open primary, sparing them a general-election race. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the parties' congressional campaign committees, the maximum 
number of battlegrounds this fall is only 130 to 150 seats -- or about 
one-third of the House. This includes 28 districts held by Democrats and 17 by 
Republicans with no incumbent running. The other potentially competitive races 
involve 75 Democrats and 13 to 30 Republicans.  
</P>
<P>
 This means that even in such a volatile year -- when voters are professed to 
be in a mood to "throw the bums out" -- two-thirds of sitting House members 
appear to be coasting to victory.  
</P>
<P>
 The forces that have combined to keep lawmakers coming back to Washington are 
still very much at work, political professionals say. In addition to lopsided 
voting registration, these include significant incumbent fund-raising 
advantages; other perks of incumbency, such as staff, district offices and 
publicly funded mail and the recognition, personal popularity and political 
expertise gained during years in public life. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, voters themselves have expressed a distinct ambivalence in recent 
years: they generally are fed up with Congress as an institution but satisfied 
with their own representative. A recent survey by The Los Angeles Times Poll 
found that 51% of respondents said their member of Congress deserved to be 
reelected while 36% said their lawmaker did not. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was ever evidence that some lawmakers simply defy opposition, it may 
be the four indicated incumbents on whom voters will pass judgment next 
Tuesday. All four have pleaded not guilty and are awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Such circumstances are hardly unique in the annals of American history. More 
than 90 members of Congress have been indicted and many sought reelection with 
charges pending. In nearly a third of such cases, the charges were dropped or 
the lawmakers were acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski, who is seeking a 19th term, is charged with diverting $636,600 
in federal funds and $56,267 in campaign funds for personal use. He has 
strongly asserted that he is innocent. At the same time, he has reimbursed the 
government for $82,000 in purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 After going all-out to survive a spirited primary challenge in his Democratic 
district, Rostenkowski was thought to be home free. He faces a little-known and 
underfunded Republican opponent.  
</P>
<P>
 Michael Flanagan, 31, a lawyer and political novice, had spent only $44,887 as 
of Oct. 19. But after a Republican National Committee poll showed him running 
surprisingly ahead, the committee pumped about $58,000 into the challenger's 
campaign this week, most of it for a last-minute television ad. 
</P>
<P>
 "This race, very minimally, is very winnable," a Flanagan spokesman said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski is making a pitch to voters that his reelection will "give me a 
chance to clear my name." In a $60,000 mailing that was to start arriving at 
constituents' homes Thursday, he wrote about "a cloud hanging over me, a cloud 
I'm certain will disappear once I get my day in court." 
</P>
<P>
 Voters may buy his argument but many do so grudgingly. "So what are we gonna 
get if we replace old guys like Rosty?" asked Doris Kugler, a retired hospital 
bookkeeper in Chicago. "Just younger versions of them, that's all."  
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, 42, a Rhodes scholar and former professor who is accused of having 
sex with a 16-year-old girl two years ago, does not even face an opponent on 
the ballot. Carl Bibbs, a state economic development officer, is running as a 
write-in candidate in the Democrat-dominated district. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, who is black, represents the mostly African American, economically 
distressed South Side of Chicago and southern suburbs that run the gamut from 
working class to affluent. He ousted divisive Democratic Rep. Gus Savage in the 
1992 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Ida Phillips, a retired school principal who lives in suburban Markham, Ill., 
says she plans to vote for Reynolds. She says she believes he is guilty but she 
is just as disgusted with the prosecutor and the alleged victim. The state's 
attorney who brought the indictment is a Republican, and the GOP "wants that 
job," she said. She said that she also believes Reynolds' claim that his 
accuser and her mother tried to extort money from him. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker, who was indicted by a federal grand jury in September for accepting 
$30,000 in bribes as mayor of Compton, also has no GOP opponent. In a district 
where 77% of registered voters are Democrats, the first-term lawmaker's sole 
challenger is Libertarian Guy Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker is black. Much of his district is low-income and heavily Latino and 
African American. He charged that the government's prosecution of him was 
racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker, who easily defeated a June primary opponent despite rumors that he was 
under investigation, is well known in Compton, the heart of the 37th District. 
His father was a school board member, councilman and mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 McDade is seeking a 17th term despite his 1992 indictment for accepting 
$100,000 in bribes and illegal gratuities -- Lear jet trips to Florida, 
expense-paid vacations at resorts and sham "scholarships" for his son -- from 
defense contractors and lobbyists. He has responded that the prosecutor was 
politically motivated, that he was unaware of any illegal contributions and 
that he reimbursed donors for any questionable expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranking Republican on the Appropriations Committee, McDade has ingratiated 
himself with his economically embattled constituents by steering so much 
federal largess to his northeastern Pennsylvania district that one pundit 
dubbed it "McDadeland." This includes the Steamtown National Historical site, a 
$66-million park and steam railroad museum that has been derided as a prime 
example of pork-barrel spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel J. Schreffler, McDade's Democratic opponent, had spent only $8,577 as 
of Oct. 19. "The only thing people care about there is that (McDade's) bringing 
home the bacon," said a Democratic operative familiar with the race.

CLINTON ASSAILS GOP 'CONTRACT' AS FRAUD; CAMPAIGN: PRESIDENT RIPS INTO 
REPUBLICAN PARTY CHIEF, SAYS PLAN TARGETS SOCIAL SECURITY. AFTER MINNESOTA 
STOP, HE FLIES TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton turned up the volume of his attacks on Republican leaders 
Friday, saying that they are "playing to the worst instincts of the American 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 In comments to reporters here, Clinton personally scored GOP Chairman Haley 
Barbour, calling the GOP's Contract With America a fraud that promises a 
balanced budget and increased defense spending while lowering taxes on most 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton charged that the Republican plan would cost Social Security recipients 
$2,000 a year and "devastate" virtually every government program. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbour, in a series of television ads and interviews this week, has denied 
that his party is planning to cut Social Security or shut down the government. 
But he has not yet spelled out how the party would pay for its promises. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said the only way that Republicans can finance their pledges is by 
destroying the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, there's always the possibility that Haley Barbour's right -- 
they're just going to deliver the goodies and forget about paying for them, in 
which case, you go right back to the 1980s, exploding deficits, shipping our 
jobs overseas, putting our economy in the ditch," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Friday, Clinton -- who has been campaigning for endangered Democrats 
across the country this week -- flew to Southern California, landing at Los 
Alamitos Naval Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 The President was met by 250 McDonnell Douglas Corp. employees as well as 
California Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer and Robert Hood, president 
of McDonnell Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton told the McDonnell Douglas employees, many of whom waved American 
flags, that the company's $1.6-billion agreement with the Chinese government to 
build 40 jetliners, signed Friday, "is a part of our ongoing effort to expand . 
. . and to maintain jobs in the United States."  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials helped negotiate the deal, which calls for 
half of the McDonnell MD-80 and MD-90 jetliners to be built in China and the 
remainder in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was to address a rally in downtown Los Angeles on Friday night and 
will speak to the Assn. of Realtors at the Anaheim Convention Center this 
morning before flying to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 The President campaigned in Minnesota for U.S. Senate candidate Ann Wynia, who 
is in a close race with freshman Republican Rep. Rod Grams for the seat now 
held by retiring Republican Sen. Dave Durenberger. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats consider Minnesota to be their best shot at stealing a seat now in 
GOP hands, and recent polls show the race to be a virtual dead heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton spoke on Wynia's behalf in a field house on the campus of the 
University of Minnesota at Duluth, praising the former majority leader of the 
Minnesota Legislature as "more of a doer than a talker." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's appearance here was the second time he has come to Minnesota for 
Wynia, and he is planning a third visit here Monday as he tries to keep the 
Senate in Democratic hands. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with San Francisco television station KGO on Friday, Clinton 
said he has been campaigning in the East, the upper Midwest and the far West 
this week because "I'm going where I think I can do the most good." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has avoided the South, the Plains states and the Rocky Mountain 
region, where his presence is thought to do Democratic candidates more harm 
than good. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton maintained that he has not completely avoided the South, a region 
particularly hostile to the President. 
</P>
<P>
 He traveled to Miami last month to campaign for Hugh Rodham, the First Lady's 
brother, who is waging a hopeless campaign for the Senate seat of popular 
Republican incumbent Connie Mack.

GOP HOPEFULS FOR HOUSE BOAST BIG WAR CHESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican challengers for House seats are spending nearly 70% more than GOP 
challengers did in 1992 campaigns, the Federal Election Commission reported 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The spending increase by GOP candidates far outstrips that of Democratic 
challengers who are seeking to be elected to the House. 
</P>
<P>
 The FEC said that the median disbursement for Republican challengers was 
$103,200 through Oct. 19 while the median spending figure by Democratic 
challengers was $45,900. That's up 8% from the spending by Democratic 
challengers in the 1992 House campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 The median spending figure by Republican challengers in the 1992 elections was 
$61,100. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest FEC figures reflect just how well-financed Republican challengers 
are in 1994 -- a fact frequently brought up by political analysts. The current 
Democrat-Republican split in the House is 256 to 178. 
</P>
<P>
 In 46 open seat races in the House where no incumbent is running, median 
spending by Republican candidates rose 60% from two years ago, to $371,800. 
Median spending by Democrats in open-seat races rose 38% from 1992, to 
$355,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "The twin problems of Republican challengers in the past have been inadequate 
funding and candidates who lacked political experience; they've taken care of 
those problems this year," said David Rohde, a professor of political science 
at Michigan State University. 
</P>
<P>
 While Republican challengers are spending more money than they did two years 
ago, GOP incumbents still lag behind the spending by Democratic incumbents -- 
whose median disbursements are $375,400. Median spending by Republican 
incumbents is $292,300. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Senate and House candidates are on a pace to spend half a billion 
dollars in the 1994 elections, and so far expenditures are up nearly 20% from 
two years ago, the FEC reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates in the 1992 elections were eager to raise money so that they could 
contend with redistricting. But fund raising for House races since then has 
nonetheless continued to go up -- 15% -- to nearly $294 million. 
</P>
<P>
 House-Senate campaign spending through Oct. 19 is $449 million, up $71 
million, a 19% increase from the same period in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Spending on House races stood at $244 million as of Oct. 19, compared to $231 
million two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate candidates have spent $205 million, up from $147 million in 1992.

 Six public school districts near the border have done an inadequate job of 
verifying the residency of their students, in one case apparently admitting 
hundreds of youngsters who cross over each day from Mexico, according to a 
series of audits by state Controller Gray Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 In releasing the reports this week, Davis stressed that the issue was 
California residency, not citizenship. State law, he said, requires districts 
to verify residency of all students and to collect tuition from those residing 
out of state, whether they come "from Nevada, Oregon -- or Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to checking school district files, auditors reported observing 
hundreds of youngsters who legally crossed the border at San Ysidro and boarded 
northbound trolleys. They were able to track 200 students to California public 
schools, most of them high schools or junior highs in the Sweetwater Union High 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials with the school districts argued that they are doing their best 
to comply with state laws on residency but that there are no clear rules on 
what procedures they must follow. 
</P>
<P>
 One superintendent, Libia S. Gil of the Chula Vista Elementary School 
District, questioned the timing of Davis' release of the audits, less than a 
week before an election in which Davis is running for lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
 "What would raise a lot of questions is the timing of all this, just a couple 
of days before election," Gil said, pointing out that the auditors completed 
their reviews in July. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for state Sen. Cathie Wright of Simi Valley, Davis' Republican 
opponent, accuses the controller of delaying the audits in response to pressure 
from Latino lawmakers -- only to move ahead later for political advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here it is five days before an election and he's using this in the eleventh 
hour to say, 'This is what I've done,' which is vintage Gray Davis," said 
Wright campaign spokesman John Theiss. "Once again Davis is using his office to 
gain higher office." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest audits are the result of allegations made a year ago by Assemblyman 
Jan Goldsmith (R-Poway), whose staff videotaped youngsters crossing the Tecate 
border and boarding buses headed for the Mountain Empire Unified School 
District. In a March report, auditors said they identified 261 students in the 
2,400-student district who did not live at the addresses listed in their files. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' staff alerted other border districts that they would soon be audited. 
But Latino legislators objected, and Davis backed down, citing prohibitive 
costs. He moved ahead when a bipartisan group of lawmakers from San Diego urged 
him to conduct the additional audits. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Sweetwater and Chula Vista, the auditors inspected records at 
the San Ysidro Elementary School District, Grossmont Union High School 
District, Amul-Dulzura Union Elementary School District and South Bay Union 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 In written responses, administrators from all six districts acknowledged 
problems in verifying student residency. All say that their districts routinely 
checked on new students. But until this year, most of the districts did not 
require documentation from returning students. All say they have begun 
correcting the deficiencies cited in the reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Some school officials were critical of the auditors for conducting an 
unscientific survey and then reaching conclusions not justified by the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We first of all acknowledge that there are students coming across the border 
on a daily basis," said Superintendent John Rindone of the 28,000-student 
Sweetwater district. "The question is the legality -- whether or not they are 
supposed to be in our schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Rindone and administrators from other districts say it is possible for 
students crossing the border to be legal residents of a California district, 
with homes and family in both countries. 
</P>
<P>
 South Bay Union Superintendent Larry Acheatel said his district changed its 
residency documentation procedures months before the auditors arrived, but 
added that the system is not foolproof. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 10,000 students in this district," he said. "If we're expected to 
follow each one home and go to each address submitted to us, either the state 
of California has to provide us more resources to do that . . . or come up with 
specific guidelines on what we are required to do."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; PROPOSITION 187; INVESTIGATION OF WALKOUTS URGED; 
INITIATIVE'S BACKERS SAY SCHOOL OFFICIALS ENCOURAGED STUDENTS TO LEAVE CLASSES 
AND PROTEST. ADMINISTRATORS DENY THE CHARGE, AND THE MEASURE'S OPPONENTS SAY 
ITS PASSAGE WOULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN CRIME.

<P>
 Backers of Proposition 187 accused school officials Friday of encouraging 
thousands of students to walk out of class in recent weeks, while opponents of 
the measure said its passage would throw hundreds of thousands more out of 
school permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 In a last-chance appeal for voters to defeat Proposition 187, Los Angeles 
County Sheriff Sherman Block and top prosecutors from Los Angeles and San 
Francisco charged that barring up to 400,000 undocumented students from school 
-- as the measure calls for -- would result in a substantial crime increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is that crime prevention means keeping kids in school," Los Angeles 
County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said at a news conference. "The law enforcement 
community is standing shoulder to shoulder saying, 'For us as professionals, 
Proposition 187 is not the way to go.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, sponsors of the ballot measure held their own news conference 
Friday morning outside Los Angeles Unified School District headquarters, urging 
that Garcetti investigate allegations that teachers and administrators 
encouraged and in some cases assisted angry students to plan and execute the 
walkouts. 
</P>
<P>
 To support their claims, they quoted a news report of Granada Hills High 
teachers helping map a march route earlier this week. They also distributed 
letters from the Long Beach and Los Angeles school districts advising parents 
about possible consequences of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are outraged and we believe that taxpayers should be outraged that dollars 
for education . . . seem to be being channeled into a political campaign," said 
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach), a major backer of the proposition. 
"We are also upset that teachers and administrators seem to be inciting the 
students to go out into the streets to ditch classes." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Garcetti said the district attorney's office had not 
received a formal request to investigate the alleged school misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified officials defended the mailing of letters to parents, 
saying they were providing only factual information. They also said they would 
look into specific reports of teachers or administrators getting involved in 
walkouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those people will be disciplined should those allegations prove true," Board 
of Education President Mark Slavkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills High School Principal Kathleen Rattay said reports of teacher 
participation in a march Wednesday were grossly exaggerated. She and other 
school officials only advised the 300 students how to conduct their march after 
spending more than two hours trying to dissuade them from leaving the campus, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scattered walkouts continued Friday, with more than 3,500 students leaving 
schools around the county. About 500 South-Central Los Angeles high school 
students gathered at Exposition Park in the morning. Three people were arrested 
there -- two on charges of battery on an officer and one on charges of 
vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Around noon, what began as a peaceful demonstration by about 200 Gardena High 
School students turned into a racial standoff and fistfight among black and 
Latino students from Gardena and Leuzinger high schools. Sheriff's officials 
made about a dozen arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 At their morning news conference, Garcetti, Block, Los Angeles City Atty. 
James Hahn and San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith asked voters to vote no on 
Proposition 187 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please dig down deep inside," Garcetti said. "The reason the (proponents of 
the measure) want the case to go to the United States Supreme Court is because 
they're hoping that the court will change the law. If that happens, are you 
going to feel good?" 
</P>
<P>
 Block agreed that passage of the measure would have a large impact on 
youngsters and crime. "Not only will many of them get into mischief," said 
Block, who was one of the first public figures to come out against the measure, 
"but many of them will become victims of crime."  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to barring illegal immigrant children from public school and 
non-emergency health care, the measure calls for educators and public health 
administrators to report suspects to federal authorities. In this manner, the 
measure's supporters say, illegal immigrants can be deported. 
</P>
<P>
 But Block raised questions about the likelihood of such deportations -- 
considering that federal authorities already have trouble keeping up with 
deportation cases at the county jail alone. 
</P>
<P>
 If Proposition 187 is approved, the federal Immigration and Naturalization 
Service would be hard-pressed to begin checking the long lists of suspects 
that, according to the measure, it would begin receiving from hospitals, 
clinics and schools, said INS spokesman Richard Kenney. 
</P>
<P>
 Block also said that the student walkouts "are really undercutting" the 
efforts to defeat the measure: "The critical voter base is going to be those 
who are yet undecided and they can be pushed in either direction." 
</P>
<P>
 In a printed statement, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony joined those opposing the 
walkouts, commending students for "their passionate interest in this election," 
but asking them to work against Proposition 187 after school. Los Angeles 
County Supervisor Gloria Molina, in a noontime appearance at Montebello High 
School, also implored students not to leave school next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the walkouts began a month ago, Los Angeles Unified administrators have 
publicly asked students to remain at school, but they also made it easy for 
them to return if they chose to leave. Administrators and teachers have walked 
with students, sometimes providing bullhorns; school buses have been provided 
to return protesters to school, and few students have been disciplined for 
leaving campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Laura Chick called Friday for teachers and administrators to 
"enforce consequences" on truant students, such as putting students in 
detention or notifying their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not tolerant of children being out of school unless they are sick or 
have some other appropriate reason," Chick said. 
</P>
<P>
 University High School did just that, assigning six hours of detention to more 
than 700 students who skipped two classes to demonstrate at the Federal 
Building in Westwood on Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Districtwide, however, most schools have followed the district's policy to 
punish only those who do not return to school after the march or who cause 
problems, such as vandalism, while off campus. 
</P>

Williams and special correspondents Leslie Berestein, Scott Collins, Jon

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; ATTORNEY GENERAL; CANDIDATES' BATTLE OF ADS OVERSHADOWS 
THE ISSUES; TOM UMBERG'S USE OF POLLY KLAAS MURDER CASE IN TV COMMERCIALS LEADS 
TO SHARP COUNTERATTACK FROM DAN LUNGREN'S CAMP. CONTROVERSY ECLIPSES DEBATE 
OVER CAMPAIGN DONATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 First there was the Polly Klaas commercial. Desperate to unseat Atty. Gen. Dan 
Lungren, Democratic challenger Tom Umberg started airing a statewide TV ad last 
week suggesting that the failure of California's top cop to fund a key computer 
database could have been the difference in the notorious Northern California 
kidnaping and murder of the 12-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes Lungren's response. This week he rolled out a commercial quoting 
newspapers critical of the Umberg ad's twist on the Klaas case. Not mentioned 
is that some of the citations -- the words "sleaze" and "slime" are prominent 
-- were lifted from editorials endorsing Umberg. 
</P>
<P>
 To back up his televised counterattack, Lungren released letters that three 
dozen district attorneys -- all supporters of the Republican incumbent -- sent 
to Umberg demanding the Polly Klaas ad be pulled. One penned by Sonoma County 
Dist. Atty. Gene L. Tunney, whose office is prosecuting the Klaas case, said 
the Umberg commercial "deceptively manipulates the facts" and "shamelessly 
exploits the memory of a deceased child to secure votes." 
</P>
<P>
 With that latest salvo, the attorney general's race has effectively become a 
television tug of war over the tragic murder of a little girl a year ago. 
Matters such as soaring juvenile crime, the new "three strikes" law, Lungren's 
reluctance to take a stand on the illegal immigration measure Proposition 187 
and Umberg's harvest of about $800,000 in campaign cash from Native American 
casinos have been overshadowed by a battle of TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sacramento Bee, however, noting the large donations from Native Americans, 
took the rare step Friday of withdrawing its endorsement of Umberg. It 
commented in an editorial that "the appearance of impropriety becomes 
overriding" with the flood of campaign dollars to Umberg from a single funding 
source. 
</P>
<P>
 In a press release, Umberg said that with casinos, the Native Americans "have 
finally created a means to become economically self-sufficient and help get 
many of their members off welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, Umberg has vowed to drop an appeal being vigorously pursued by 
Lungren of a federal court ruling that allows casino-style gambling on Indian 
reservations.  
</P>
<P>
 Umberg's campaign team also argued that Lungren has received big donations 
from business interests he has helped during his tenure as attorney general. 
Among them are the California Manufacturer's Assn., which has contributed 
$200,000 in recent years, and the wine industry, a solid Lungren supporter that 
has donated more than $100,000 in campaign funds, including $50,000 in the last 
week alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Umberg camp continued Friday to insist that its ad, which features the 
grandfather of Polly Klaas laying a bouquet of white flowers at the girl's 
memorial shrine, simply states the facts. Umberg contends that he is not 
accusing Lungren of complicity in a murder, just of administrative malfeasance. 
</P>
<P>
 He argues that Lungren was boosting his public relations budget at the same 
time he slashed funding for a statewide computer database that could have 
alerted deputies to the criminal record of suspect Richard Allen Davis before 
Polly died. "Lungren has the priorities of a politician, not a prosecutor," 
said George Urch, Umberg's campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis was questioned briefly the night of the kidnaping by sheriff's deputies 
unaware of the Klaas case. Umberg has insisted that the deputies might have 
detained Davis had the database been in place to identify him as a parolee. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren campaign officials counter that the attorney general was trying to 
find money for the new system, but did not want to take funds from Justice 
Department responsibilities -- such as fingerprint identification and forensics 
-- already under the budgetary knife. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the database, the deputies could have tapped a state computer 
that provides police with details of criminal histories, Lungren contends. But 
without knowledge of the Klaas kidnaping, the deputies lacked probable cause to 
check that system. 
</P>
<P>
 Would deputies have acted differently had they known Davis was a parolee? 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Moore, Sonoma County assistant sheriff, said that Davis' tattooed arms 
and scruffy appearance prompted his deputies to "suspect he had done prison 
time." But even had they known his criminal history, Moore said, "it doesn't 
provide added probable cause to make an arrest."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; PROPOSITION 187; ANTI-187 PROTESTER HONORED FOR HALTING 
BURNING OF FLAG

<P>
 An anti-Proposition 187 demonstrator who was kicked and beaten when he 
prevented other demonstrators from burning an American flag was presented with 
a U.S. flag Friday by a San Diego congressman who supports Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 David Phillips Jr., 25, a political science major at Palomar College, was part 
of an anti-Proposition 187 demonstration Wednesday outside San Marcos City Hall 
when he saw demonstrators spraying a flag with lighter fluid and trying to set 
it afire. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips snatched the flag and ran but was overtaken and knocked to the 
ground, according to the San Diego Sheriff's Department. Deputies rescued 
Phillips, who suffered bruises and a sore jaw, but they made no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Rep. Randy (Duke) Cunningham (R-San Diego) gave Phillips a flag on Friday 
in an informal meeting at Cunningham's Escondido office. The flag had once 
flown over the U.S. Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham, a retired Navy fighter pilot and decorated Vietnam veteran, said 
he wanted to show his admiration for Phillips' courage in risking injury to 
protect the flag. Phillips' father served in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips, who serves as a caretaker for a woman with AIDS, was not available 
for comment. However, the woman, Marcia Sanders, 42, of Oceanside, said 
Phillips believes that Proposition 187 violates the human rights of 
undocumented immigrants but that he could not stand to see the U.S. flag 
sullied. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did what he had to do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A San Diego veterans' organization has also announced it will present Phillips 
with its "American Hero" award. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Phillips prevented the crowd from burning that particular flag, 
another flag was burned earlier by the same crowd, which consisted of about 250 
people, mostly from Palomar College and local high schools.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; GOVERNOR; BROWN RUNS ON EMPTY; LEADER WILSON COASTS; WITH 
FUNDS NEARLY DEPLETED, DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGER HOPES A CLINTON APPEARANCE IN L.A. 
AND ANTI-PROP. 187 FERVOR WILL SPUR A RALLY. BUT THE GOVERNOR APPEARS CONFIDENT 
AS THE RACE HEADS INTO ITS FINAL DAYS.

 Starved for cash, the Kathleen Brown campaign for governor appeared to be 
running on the sheer energy of the candidate Friday, counting on a surge of 
support from President Clinton and a big anti-Proposition 187 vote to carry her 
to victory over incumbent Republican Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was ending his campaign for a second term much as he has in past 
statewide elections -- calm, confident, and sitting on what seemed to be a 
relatively comfortable lead in most public opinion polls. Wilson and his GOP 
ticket-mates gathered in Sacramento for an evening rally to kick off a weekend 
tour of major California media markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton flew to California for a second time to plug the Democratic ticket 
headed by Brown and Sen. Dianne Feinstein -- first at a big rally in front of 
Los Angeles City Hall on Friday evening and today in Oakland -- both areas 
where Democrats need substantial majorities to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking on Brown's behalf to an estimated 2,000 people at City Hall, Clinton 
called on Californians to elect her so he will have a governor he can work 
with. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need a partner here," Clinton said, "somebody who's going to work for 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, acting Secretary of State Tony Miller predicted a higher voter 
turnout Tuesday than in the last gubernatorial election. Miller estimated that 
60.2% of California's 14.7 million registered voters would vote Tuesday or cast 
absentee ballots by then. The turnout in 1990, when Wilson defeated Feinstein 
for governor by 3.5%, was 58.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller attributed the projected increase -- in contrast to a record low 
turnout in the June primary -- to the vigorous campaign over Proposition 187, 
the petition measure that proposes to cut off state-financed health, education 
and social services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not since Proposition 13 on the ballot in the 1978 primary has there been 
this degree of engagement by voters on both sides of a measure," Miller said, 
referring to the property-tax cutting measure that rocked California politics 
and fiscal policy through the 1980s and into the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, a higher turnout helps Democrats. But Wilson campaign spokesman 
Dan Schnur said that interest in Proposition 187 was motivating as many 
supporters of the initiative -- mostly Republicans -- to go to the polls as 
opponents, who are mostly Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, the 49-year-old state treasurer, continued to tie her campaign closely 
to opposition of Proposition 187, which is backed by Wilson.  
</P>
<P>
 In appearances in San Diego and Sacramento, Brown described proponents of the 
measure as "those of narrow vision, those of mean spirit, those of short 
sights." 
</P>
<P>
 But by defeating the initiative, she said, "Californians have a chance on 
Tuesday to turn on the lights against the darkness of racial division, fear and 
intolerance." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown campaign also announced that two new campaign commercials ready to 
be aired Friday were being held over the weekend, apparently for lack of funds. 
The ads will run statewide Monday, spokesman John Whitehurst said, but he 
declined to say how often they would run or where. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown ads planned for today and Sunday on two major Los Angeles television 
stations were either canceled or pulled by the Brown campaign for lack of 
funds, the stations said. Schnur, the Wilson aide, said this was tantamount to 
running up a "white flag of surrender" in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown told reporters in Sacramento: "I am just fine. I have plenty of 
resources to carry me over the finish line victoriously. . . . If you notice in 
the polls, I am moving up in spite of the fact of being outspent by over $5 
million in the last three weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown cited a poll by KNBC-TV in Los Angeles that showed her closing to within 
4% of Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the results of a poll conducted for KCBS-TV and broadcast Thursday 
evening put Wilson on top by 18%. In both the major independent statewide 
surveys -- the Los Angeles Times Poll and the Field Poll conducted in late 
October -- Wilson led by 9% among likely voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson opened the day Friday by again demonstrating his ability to use his 
incumbency to complement his campaign. In his official role as governor, Wilson 
celebrated the reopening of the final segment of the giant Golden 
State-Antelope Valley Freeway interchange in the Newhall Pass that was severely 
damaged in the Northridge earthquake in January. 
</P>
<P>
 After the quake, political experts speculated on how long it would take the 
state to repair the damage and suggested that angry motorists backed up on 
detours in the first week in November might take out their frustration on the 
governor at the ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson ordered state highway officials to cut red tape in letting contracts 
and getting the damaged freeways reopened as soon as possible. Friday's 
ceremony marked completion of the job, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got government out of the way to expedite recovery," Wilson told about 200 
onlookers. While Wilson shared credit for fixing the freeways with the federal 
government, he also sneaked in an election-year plug on the California economy: 
"Unemployment is falling in California . . . and here in Los Angeles County, 
which has been hardest hit. That's because the people of this area refuse to 
take it lying down." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Brown issued a statement saying that California in fact lost jobs 
during the last month and that jobs created during the period primarily were 
low-paying service positions and in the public sector.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; CLOSE-UP; GROANS AND GRIPES AS THE CAMPAIGN GRINDS TO A 
CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The end of the 1994 gubernatorial contest is finally in sight and here is what 
it's come to: Gov. Pete Wilson's campaign is struggling to keep its underwear 
clean, while Kathleen Brown's staff is having trouble buttoning its pants. 
</P>
<P>
 The other day, H.D. Palmer, Wilson's communications director, was aboard a 
northbound plane when he got a call from campaign headquarters asking him to 
head south. He politely declined. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Number 1, I'm taxiing down the runway. Number 2, I have no clean 
socks and shorts and I think we would all be well served if I did,' " he 
recalled. "I flew to Sacramento and did my laundry." 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Buckner, Brown's deputy press secretary, uses a different yardstick to 
measure the stress of a campaign's countless 14-hour days: the waistline. An 
informal poll of 23 staffers at Brown's Los Angeles headquarters found a net 
weight gain of 147 pounds, and Buckner admits that a chunk of that can be found 
on her slight frame. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's the problem: no exercise, bad food, and you eat late at night, 
sometimes in mass quantities -- takeout pizza, takeout Indian food, takeout 
Thai food, takeout pasta," said Buckner, who worked for Sen. Barbara Boxer's 
campaign before Brown's. "I haven't been to an aerobics class since the 1992 
election cycle." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially during these final days, campaigns are unforgiving creatures. To 
work for one is to be pulled into another world -- a world where winning comes 
first, even if that means your own chores don't get done and your body is less 
a temple than a temporary storage facility for cold pizza. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, some people have been wearing their campaign-induced troubles like 
badges of honor. A Brown staffer grimaces when he says he has gained 40 pounds 
-- and yet he seems to tell everyone he meets. A Wilson employee laments that 
the campaign has left no time for romance -- but there's a hint of pride in her 
voice, as if loneliness is proof of commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the perverse pleasure that shared suffering brings. In all the 
analogies people use for a campaign staff -- a team, an army, a family -- 
togetherness is the common thread. If nothing else, the people who do Wilson 
and Brown's scheduling, who arrive at their campaign stops in advance, who type 
up their press releases and answer their phones can all say they survived 
campaign '94. And the worse the ordeal, the more impressive that sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 To be fair, reporters are the same way. For weeks, members of the news media 
have greeted one another at campaign events by shouting out how many more days 
remain before Election Day. "Is it over yet?" they ask each other with a sigh 
that says: It sure is tough doing such difficult and important work as ours. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Schnur, Wilson's chief campaign spokesman, has tapped into this vein in 
the fax newsletter he sends to reporters, Schnur Shots. Every one of these 
missives ends with a tally of "HOURS TO GO" till the polls close. "Hang in 
there people!" Schnur writes. "I think we can make it!" 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Schnur says that after several years working in politics, he's 
got his family trained not to expect much from him during a campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandparents know I'm only going to celebrate the High Holy Days with them 
on odd-numbered years," he said, referring to the Jewish holidays of Rosh 
Hashanah and Yom Kippur. 
</P>
<P>
 But the daily grind still takes a toll. To let off steam, Schnur may be the 
only person on either campaign staff who has stuck to an exercise regimen -- 
but not for the reasons you might think. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a secret: I've named each different weight machine after a different 
newspaper or newspaper reporter. I use them to work out my aggressions," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (Los Angeles) Times is the overhead curl. The (San Jose) Mercury (News) 
is the shoulder press. The (San Diego) Union-Tribune is the leg extension and 
L.A. TV generally is the Stairmaster. A Northern California newspaper that 
shall remain nameless has to be rotated (to different machines), otherwise I'd 
be deformed by now." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "What is that phrase from the '60s? 'War is not good for children and other 
living things'?" asked Steven M. Glazer, an aide to Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Glazer joined Brown's campaign, he extracted an unusual promise from 
campaign chairman Clint Reilly. Glazer wanted to be home every night between 7 
and 9 to spend time with his children, ages 3 and 7 months. Reilly agreed, but 
Glazer has rarely been able to make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Campaigns are perennially understaffed. If you recognize what needs to be 
done . . . and you're trying to produce quality work, then it's very difficult 
to ever go home," he said. "It's worth the sacrifice to work for someone you 
really believe in. But it's never easy to say that when you're still at work at 
9 o'clock at night and you haven't tucked your kids into bed." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer, Wilson's communications director, has spent the last five months far 
from his fiancee, who is in graduate school in Chicago. He consoles himself by 
remembering that even if she were here, he wouldn't see her. Recently, his diet 
has consisted largely of frozen macaroni and cheese, and diet cola. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a campaign, caffeine is your friend," he said. "You get up in the morning, 
you read the paper, you eat breakfast, you come in, you work 12 or 13 hours . . 
. you microwave something, you go to bed. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat." 
</P>
<P>
 So how to recuperate? Hawaii and Jamaica are among the favored destinations 
for those who have planned post-election vacations. Also on the schedule: 
exercise, and lots of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been on the staff since Jan. 3 and I've gained double digits," said 
Buckner, Brown's deputy press secretary. "My goal is to lose the weight twice 
as fast as I gained it." 
</P>

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; AD WAR ESCALATES IN BATTLE OVER PROPOSITION 188 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To back Proposition 188, the initiative to repeal California's smoking bans, 
the tobacco industry abandoned a low-key campaign and is making heavy use of 
television ads. The switch in strategy was in response to an "educational" ad 
campaign aimed at the measure funded by two wealthy health care foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE "NEUTRAL" ADS: Designed by the nonprofit Public Media Center in San 
Francisco, the advertisements at first appear not to take sides. The 30-second 
spots open with a crowd shot. A narrator says: "Californians have a lot of 
important decisions to make this November." The narrator then focuses on 
Proposition 188, and says: "Do you know who the major contributors are on each 
side?" A file folder appears on the screen. On one side of the folder, Philip 
Morris tobacco company is listed as the main donor for Proposition 188. On the 
other side, the American Cancer Society is named as the main donor against it. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: The ads accurately reflect aspects of the campaign. Although 
outwardly neutral, the ads can also be seen to serve as an equalizer to the 
"vote yes" campaign. Opponents of Proposition 188 say that people will vote 
down the initiative if they know the tobacco industry backs it. Although those 
openly opposed to Proposition 188 have had little money to run ads, the Public 
Media Center campaign budgeted as much as $4 million. Since those ads began 
running, support for Proposition 188 has fallen sharply in public opinion 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ADS "FOR": In an imitation of the Public Media Center campaign, the 
Proposition 188 supporters aired 30-second spots that open with a crowd shot. A 
narrator intones: "We Californians have a lot of complicated decisions to make. 
That's why you deserve to know the facts about Proposition 188." A file folder 
appears. Reasons appear on both sides of the file folder to vote for the 
initiative. Among the claims are that it prohibits smoking in public places, 
doubles fines for selling tobacco to minors and bans cigarette vending 
machines.  
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: Although the pro-Proposition 188 ads appear to be factual, 
they include several false statements. The initiative would not ban smoking in 
public places, but would repeal scores of local ordinances that prohibit 
smoking in restaurants. Proposition 188 also would block a statewide ban on 
smoking in restaurants and other workplaces from taking effect in January. If 
Proposition 188 becomes law, business owners would set their own smoking 
policies, and restaurant owners could set aside up to 25% of their space for 
ventilated smoking sections. Nor would the initiative ban cigarette vending 
machines. Rather, it would repeal 150 local ordinances that restrict or ban 
cigarette machines. The Public Media Center has sued, claiming the ads are 
misleading and portray its nonprofit group as a supporter of Proposition 188.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; INSURANCE COMMISSIONER; INDUSTRY DONORS GIVE QUACKENBUSH 
BIG FUNDING EDGE ON TORRES; INSURERS AND AGENTS HAVE GIVEN AT LEAST $1.9 
MILLION TO THE GOP CANDIDATE, ACCORDING TO HIS OPPONENT. MANY OF THE DONORS ARE 
SEEKING RATE INCREASES THAT WILL BE DECIDED BY THE WINNER.

<P>
 A surge of new contributions in the final burst of campaigning, mostly from 
the insurance industry, is giving the Republican candidate for insurance 
commissioner, Charles W. Quackenbush, an ever greater funding advantage over 
his Democratic opponent, Art Torres. 
</P>
<P>
 During October, Assemblyman Quackenbush pulled in more than 2 1/2 times the 
money given to state Sen. Torres, according to reports filed with the secretary 
of state's office.  
</P>
<P>
 Of Quackenbush's $1.12 million total for that month, campaign reports show 
that 80% came from the insurance industry, which the GOP candidate says he 
would regulate less stringently than either Torres or the present commissioner, 
Democrat John Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres received less than 10% of his contributions from the insurance industry 
in the October reporting period -- and the gap widened in recent days as late 
contributions were reported to the secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first three days of November, Quackenbush raised $105,110, while Torres 
got only $4,500, according to reports available Friday, four days before 
Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 At least $70,000 of the most recent Quackenbush money came from insurers or 
their agents, and it may have been more. Two contributors, who gave a total of 
$7,000, could not be located or identified by profession. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, none of Torres' new $4,500 came from the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not all contributions are fully identified in either candidate's 
reports, a Quackenbush spokeswoman said she would accept as "fairly accurate" a 
Torres campaign estimate that Quackenbush received $882,410 in insurance 
industry money of his total of $1,120,026 in the October report. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether during his campaign, Quackenbush's contributions from the insurance 
industry have totaled at least $1.9 million, about 68% of the $2.8 million he 
has raised so far, according to Torres' tracking of his rival's funding. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, only $42,500 of $436,697 that the Torres campaign raised since 
Oct. 1 came from industry interests, according to estimates tallied by 
Quackenbush, and most of that money came from insurance defense law firms, not 
the companies, agents and brokers that gave to Quackenbush. 
</P>
<P>
 The Quackenbush campaign estimates put Torres' contributions from interests 
affiliated in some way with the industry at about $250,000 of a campaign total 
of $1,747,624, or about 15%. But the Torres campaign disputes claims that much 
of that actually came from the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Los Angeles news conference Thursday at which he announced his support 
for Torres, national consumer advocate Ralph Nader contended that the 
comparative contributions show that Quackenbush would be beholden to the 
industry if he were elected. 
</P>
<P>
 In a play on Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, Nader quipped that Quackenbush as 
commissioner would be "of Safeco, by Allstate and for Cygna." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres was also formally endorsed by Harvey Rosenfield, the fiery insurance 
reform leader who was the author of Proposition 103 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush's announced policy is to accept money from companies, agents, 
brokers and other industry elements. Torres says he will not take money from 
those sources, but will take funds from attorneys who work for insurers and 
other industry elements not regulated by the state Department of Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres says he has returned several thousand dollars when he realized that the 
donors were companies, agents or brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 A further analysis of Quackenbush contributors indicated that $75,106 of the 
Republican's money has come from State Farm or its agents, $46,218 from Farmers 
or its agents, and $70,180 from Allstate Co. or its agents. Another $100,000 
came from the smaller Zenith Insurance Co. The industry's leading lobby in 
Sacramento, the Assn. of California Insurance Companies, gave $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the givers have filed for rate increases that will be decided by the 
next commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Another analysis of Quackenbush contributors, by Rosenfield, contended that 
industry gifts to the Republican totaled $1.1 million in October and $2.1 
million altogether this year. But the Quackenbush campaign said these figures 
represent some double counting involving two campaign funds and were a little 
too high. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Torres contributions, by contrast, came from medical practitioners and 
lawyers who play a role in the politics of insurance in the state but are not 
directly regulated by the commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates were asked this week to assess what the figures mean to the 
electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres said, "The voters are going to get higher (insurance premium) rates 
with Quackenbush, pure and simple . . . It's clear (my opponent) is being 
manipulated by an industry which he wants to regulate." 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush said that regardless of his contributions he intends to be an 
independent commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, he said the industry is giving so heavily to his campaign because 
"people contribute to people based on their philosophical orientation." He said 
that does not mean that insurance rates would rise more under him than under 
Torres.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; STATE SENATE; VETERAN LEGISLATORS DILLS, 84, AND GREENE, 
76, FACE AN AGE-OLD ELECTION ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With all the anxiety about anti-incumbency fever sweeping entrenched 
legislators out of office Tuesday, two of California's oldest and 
longest-serving state senators are counting on catchy advertising slogans to 
turn their longevity in office to advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic Sens. Ralph C. Dills of El Segundo and Leroy F. Greene of 
Sacramento are in heavily contested races. Besides their own careers, riding on 
the outcome could be the continued leadership of new Senate President Pro Tem 
Bill Lockyer of Hayward, who is fighting to maintain Democratic control of the 
upper house. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one of the Senate's 40 seats are up for grabs Tuesday. Democrats now 
hold 22, Republicans 15 and independents two. There is one vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
 To help hang on to his lead, Lockyer is betting on Dills, 84, a former 
professional musician who last spring won a hard-fought primary. In a district 
that stretches from Venice to Long Beach, Dills put up billboards showing him 
blowing his trademark saxophone and emblazoned with the slogan, "Too Old to 
Quit." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in a TV spot featuring sepia-toned still photos and ragtime-style music, 
Dills, first elected to the Assembly in 1938, tells voters in his folksy drawl, 
"Yes, I'm older than these old pictures, but it's today's police officers that 
support me," and he adds that firefighters support him for "making their jobs 
safer today," not for past favors. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills, who in the primary was targeted for defeat by the League of 
Conservation Voters, says in the spot being aired on cable TV that he views the 
environment from a different vantage point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like a lot of Californians my age," he chuckles, "I took it for granted, but 
you're never too old to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a similar tack, 76-year-old Greene, first elected to the Assembly in 
1962, is employing billboards with an owl perched on a tree limb and describing 
himself as "a tough old bird" who does not march in lock-step with any special 
interest. Greene even has a TV spot designed to show his vigor as he quickly 
dashes off his accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 Both reelection drives are overseen by veteran Sacramento-based consultant 
Richie Ross. Ross said he needed to take the initiative to spell out the 
definition of old, rather than allow the Republican challengers to tag his 
candidates as too old to continue in office. For Dills, Ross said, old "meant 
cool," and in Greene's case, "we made him crotchety." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they had no choice but to lead with the age issue" to defuse it as a 
potential liability with voters, said Senate Republican Caucus Chairman Bill 
Leonard. "You can't have a photo of them (Dills and Greene) without running 
across the age issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Leonard maintained that both longtime lawmakers are vulnerable, 
especially in a year when the Los Angeles Times Poll indicated that voters give 
a slight edge to Republicans as the party that can best handle government. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills' reelection fray is a classic battle between a veteran lawmaker and a 
newcomer, attorney David Barrett Cohen, who has never held political office. As 
of late October, Dills reported raising $668,000, while Cohen has received 
contributions of only $97,000. This discrepancy prompted Leonard to suggest 
that Cohen "probably has done more with less than any of our candidates. He's 
made a credible campaign on a shoestring." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen, 34, has lambasted Dills on his special-interest contributions and long 
tenure. In one mailer, he played off Dills' primary campaign slogan. Holding a 
saxophone, Cohen says in the piece, "Time to Change the Tune." 
</P>
<P>
 Greene is facing Republican Dave Cox, a Sacramento County supervisor and 
businessman, who is mounting an aggressive challenge in an area that was once a 
Democratic stronghold but is increasingly tilting toward the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 In TV ads and brochures featuring a dog lying on its back, Greene accuses Cox 
of voting for projects sought by campaign contributors. "Throw Dave a bone. He 
rolls over," the ads blare. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitting Greene on his longevity, Cox asks, "What can Leroy Greene accomplish 
in the next four years that he hasn't in the last 32 years?" 
</P>

HOWARD ROSENBERG; WHEN A LITTLE SKEPTICISM IS IN ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 TV interviewer: "How do you regard your opponent?"  
</P>
<P>
 Candidate: "With contempt. My opponent is a lying, philandering, law-breaking, 
child-molesting, spouse-beating, puppy-kicking, tax-embezzling, racist, sexist, 
ageist, godless, Communist, fascist, anarchist Army deserter, armed robber, 
serial murderer, mobster and necrophiliac who is spying on the U.S. for a 
foreign government."  
</P>
<P>
 TV interviewer: "Thank you very much. Now the weather. . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 No, the above is not an excerpt from a TV interview with Republican Mike 
Huffington, in an antagonistic race with Democratic incumbent Diane Feinstein 
for the U.S. Senate. It's a gross exaggeration. Well, perhaps not all that 
gross. 
</P>
<P>
 In some respects, California candidate Huffington's nannygate -- the jolting 
disclosure that he and his wife, Arianna, had employed an illegal immigrant to 
tend their young children for nearly five years -- has been TV's ninnygate. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington gets away with a lot. In part it's the way he speaks, slinging 
verbiage with such scattershot rapidity that his words bounce like raindrops 
without immediately penetrating. For whatever reason, TV interviewers too 
rarely hold him accountable. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, their experience with Huffington is a strong argument against the 
very concept of live interviews when the material is complex and the time 
allotted is woefully inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 During their tightly formatted 4 p.m. Friday newscast on KABC-TV Channel 7, 
for example, anchors Christine Lund and Steve Wolford tried gamely, in the 
scant minutes given them to quiz Huffington, to dissect his countercharges 
against Feinstein concerning her own alleged employment of an illegal immigrant 
in the early 1980s. But Huffington steamrollered them with new alleged data 
with which they appeared unfamiliar, intensifying his crusade to hang a 
"hypocrite" label on Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 With Huffington making the TV rounds with his new anti-Feinstein story early 
Friday night, KCBS-TV Channel 2 reporter Linda Breakstone got a crack at him 
via satellite while covering a Los Angeles rally for President Clinton. 
Breakstone did aggressively ask Huffington to account for the Associated Press 
refuting a portion of his current TV ad quoting the AP as saying Feinstein had 
lied concerning her own immigrant controversy. Huffington: The AP "just came 
out with another announcement. . . ." Its substance? He didn't say, and he 
wasn't asked, as the fleeting interview ended and Breakstone went back to 
covering Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, there was Huffington earlier Friday with anchors Susan Lichtman and 
Tony McEwing on the KTTV-TV Channel 11 morning show, "Good Day L.A.," taking 
questions from citizens at various Los Angeles sites while being allowed to 
deftly spin away from his own nannygate crisis and excoriate Feinstein for 
hers. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Huffington was asked by an Angeleno how he envisioned 
enforcement of Proposition 187, the hotly debated California initiative that 
would end nearly all social services for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will be up to Gov. Wilson," Huffington replied, "and I'm sure they'll 
work on it after it passes." Next question. 
</P>
<P>
 But wait a minute. Rewind the tape. Hadn't Huffington just admitted that he 
hadn't a clue about enforcement of this initiative that he so vociferously 
backs? And the Channel 11 anchors hadn't called him on it? Yikes! 
</P>
<P>
 The tradition of reverence in TV news interviews -- an attitude akin to "the 
customer's always right" in retailing -- extends back to the medium's 
inception. Yet more than four decades later, why are so many newscasters still 
such utterly inept wimps when it comes to live interviews of political 
candidates and their surrogates, not bothering even to challenge them when they 
tell obvious tall stories or make charges that can't be substantiated? 
</P>
<P>
 Not that TV's grand inquisitors should imitate CNN's "Crossfire," where 
interviews resemble muggings. Nor should they be as worshipful as the host of 
CNN's "Larry King Live." Somewhere in between would do. 
</P>
<P>
 These newscasters -- most often they're anchors -- usually rebut their 
detractors by noting that live TV interviewing is horrendously difficult and 
something their critics could never do. Point well taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet their critics aren't the ones being paid to do it, and they are. So . . . 
shouldn't these professionals be expected to do it competently, just as we 
demand competency from a plumber or concert pianist, whose tough jobs are also 
beyond the skills of most of us? 
</P>
<P>
 Why aren't more newscasters like ABC's Ted Koppel, the "Nightline" host who 
processes information during live interviews faster than anyone else on 
television? All right, for years Koppel has occupied his own stratosphere as an 
interviewer, exhibiting an acute ear and awareness, almost as if observing his 
own interview from out of body. 
</P>
<P>
 Back on earth, though, why aren't more TV interviewers even like Mary 
Tillotson, the incisive host of "CNN & Company," a weekday half- hour program 
that hashes over topical events? 
</P>
<P>
 One of Tillotson's guests last week was Arianna Huffington. Naturally, illegal 
immigration came up, specifically the Huffingtons' admission that they had 
apparently broken federal law by employing an illegal immigrant as a nanny and 
not paid all the required taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 When Arianna Huffington repeated her claim that she didn't learn that the 
nanny was in the United States illegally until nearly a year later, Tillotson 
logically wanted to know if she asked the woman about her citizen status when 
she hired her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't ask," the candidate's wife replied. "I had just had a baby. . . ." 
Tillotson paused a bit, then asked Huffington about the nanny: "She had a Latin 
American accent, didn't she?" 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington: "Yes." Tillotson: "And no one in your household thought to inquire 
if she were an illegal immigrant." 
</P>
<P>
 Tillotson's summation carried a glint of sarcasm that reflected a reasonable 
skepticism. She should give lessons to her colleagues.

O.C. STUDENTS MARCH, DOCTORS PLAN TO CONTINUE HUNGER STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Protests against Proposition 187 continued Friday throughout Orange County, 
ranging from student demonstrations in Tustin, Santa Ana, Anaheim and Costa 
Mesa to a hunger strike launched by more than a dozen doctors in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 The members of California Hispanic Medical Group in Orange said they plan to 
continue their liquid only fast until Election Day and predicted other 
physicians would join. 
</P>
<P>
 "As health-care providers we cannot stand idly by and soon become potential 
instruments of a Gestapo-like machine apparatus requiring us to report any 
patient that comes to us in their time and hour of medical need and is unable 
to verify their legal status," said Fernando A. Montelongo, president of the 
medical group. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 would deny illegal immigrants most public social services 
including education and all but emergency health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of students walked out of at least 10 high schools and middle schools 
from Santa Ana, Tustin and Orange to stage a six-hour protest in the streets 
throughout Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The protests began about 10:30 a.m. when 100 Tustin High students marched to 
Century High to coax students there to walk off campus. They were unaware that 
about 200 Century students already had left the campus and were on their way to 
other schools to recruit protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tustin students walked miles to City Hall, the Civic Center and a number 
of schools, waving flags and placards denouncing Proposition 187 and Gov. Pete 
Wilson.  
</P>
<P>
 Some schools were approached three times by different groups of protesters. 
The groups all converged at Memorial Park about 1:30 p.m., where the crowd grew 
to about 400.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're teen-agers. We have no right to vote," said Abimael Cabrera, 18, a 
Tustin High senior. "That's why we're out here, to get voters to know that 187 
is wrong and inhumane." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposition "is going to affect the people who can't even vote," said Ana 
Palma, 15, a Tustin sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin Principal Bob Boies, who followed closely behind his students for a few 
hours, walking and riding with police, said he sympathized with their cause and 
opposed Proposition 187. "It is racist . . . mean-spirited legislation," he 
said, "and the kids feel powerless." 
</P>
<P>
 But Boies said he wasn't happy with the walkout, adding that students who left 
the campus will be expelled, suspended or given detention for ditching school. 
</P>
<P>
 In Anaheim, police escorted about 25 students, many carrying Mexican flags, 
down Ball Road from Magnolia Avenue to Dale Avenue. The morning protest was so 
peaceful that even the police decided to leave, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Costa Mesa, about 60 Estancia High students marched down West 19th Street 
after class. Led by a student carrying an American flag and escorted by several 
Costa Mesa motorcycle officers, the students waved signs and chanted anti-187 
slogans. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the afternoon, another group of 50 to 100 medical students and 
doctors from UC Irvine Medical School and UCLA gathered with signs and banners 
in front of Tustin City Hall to protest the ballot initiative.

DISNEY CONSIDERING SCALING BACK RESORT, EISNER SAYS; DEVELOPMENT: ORANGE COUNTY 
PROJECT'S $3-BILLION PRICE MAY BE TOO HIGH, CHAIRMAN SAYS. OPTIONS INCLUDE 
DOWNSIZING OR BUILDING IN PHASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael D. Eisner confirmed Friday that the company 
is considering scaling back its $3-billion Disneyland Resort because the 
project appears to be too costly, especially in California's economic climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner declined to offer specifics, but said the resort might be built in 
phases or that Disney might have to reduce its "appetite slightly." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very complex issue," he said. "It can mean reducing in size, it can 
mean reducing in scope, it can mean changing the mix of the product. We're 
looking at all the different ways to make the project viable." 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner's comments were the first public concession by Disney that the company 
is seriously considering downsizing the ambitious project, which, as proposed, 
would include a 1,800-room hotel district, a lushly landscaped shopping area, a 
5,000-seat amphitheater, a six-acre man-made lake and a new 
international-themed park called Westcot, adjacent to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at all sorts of different opportunities and prospects," said 
Eisner, who was in Santa Ana on Friday for the opening of the Walt Disney 
Gallery at the MainPlace mall. "We're looking at how to do a project like this 
in an urban environment and still have it be fiscally responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 The chairman said he still feels the financial sting of more than $550 million 
in losses from Euro Disney in France and is trying to make sure that does not 
happen in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner said the recent decision to abandon the Disney's America project in 
Virginia will not affect what happens in Anaheim. He also said the company is 
committed to developing other tourism projects in Orange County, will continue 
to put money into Disneyland and plans to decide on the Disneyland Resort "very 
soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's internal review, however, has further postponed the much-delayed 
project, which is at least two years behind its original groundbreaking 
schedule. Furthermore, Disney officials have refused to commit to building the 
project until they receive as much as $800 million in financial support from 
Anaheim, Orange County and state and federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Anaheim city officials said their negotiations on a 
development agreement with Disney have been temporarily halted because the 
company's planners and financial analysts are trying to re-evaluate and 
possibly downsize the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just a time for re-evaluation and reassessment of the magnitude of 
the project," said City Manager James D. Ruth. "We're still very optimistic 
about this going forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, city officials say that regardless of Disney's plans, they are 
committed to moving forward on a $172.5-million project to beautify the area 
around Disneyland by widening streets, installing underground utilities and 
planting tropical landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the possibility of a scaled-back project has caused some concern 
among those in the tourism industry.  
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, any downsizing could have some impact on our city as a 
destination," said Ned Snavely, general manager of the Anaheim Marriott. "We'll 
have to wait and see what they mean by downsizing. The chances are that it 
might not be as exciting for those who would be coming into the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill O'Connell, general manager of four Stovall Best Westerns near Disneyland, 
said most hotel and motel owners are still optimistic and hope that the project 
"will be the boost in the arm" that the local tourism industry needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to see the very best thing that Disney can do, but we understand 
they have to work within their budget," O'Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner said he appreciates the support Disney has received from city officials 
and the business community. But "the worst thing we could do," he said, is to 
put the "the whole project at risk" by moving ahead before the economics of the 
resort make better sense. 
</P>
<P>
 One plan under consideration, he said, is building the project in phases over 
a longer period than projected. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of whether Disney builds the project, Eisner said the company will 
continue to make improvements in and around Disneyland, its 39-year-old 
flagship theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is building two ice rinks in Anaheim for its Mighty Ducks hockey 
team and community skating programs, and is almost finished with a new thrill 
ride based on the Indiana Jones movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disneyland itself has never been better," Eisner said. "No matter what we do, 
we're never going to let Disneyland become an aging theme park."

GOODEN BANNED FOR NEXT SEASON; BASEBALL: ALREADY SUSPENDED ONCE THIS YEAR, FREE 
AGENT PITCHER IS PENALIZED FOR REPEATED DRUG VIOLATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 If there is a 1995 baseball season, pitcher Dwight Gooden doesn't figure to be 
a part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden, whose problems with cocaine surfaced seven years ago, was banned 
Friday for the entire season by major league baseball for repeated drug 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden, who will turn 30 in two weeks, already had been suspended once this 
year after testing positive for drugs. He was treated at the Betty Ford Center 
last summer, but then tested positive again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dwight Gooden needs to get his life in order," said Joe McIlvaine, general 
manager of the New York Mets, Gooden's team before he became a free agent last 
month. "Dwight needs to realize the problem and come to grips with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been offered the best assistance baseball and the New York Mets have 
to give for his problem and he has not taken advantage of this guidance and 
help. All of us who love this man urge him to get the help he needs, put God 
into his life and exhibit the same tenacity he showed on the mound, especially 
in the early years of his career, when a lead in the seventh inning meant a 
victory in the ninth." 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden was with the Mets for all of his 11-year career before becoming a free 
agent on Oct. 24. By the time he was 21, he had been National League rookie of 
the year and a Cy Young Award winner. But six months after leading the Mets to 
a World Series title in 1986, he admitted to a cocaine problem and voluntarily 
entered a treatment center. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he has been tested by baseball as many as three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, however, he failed four drug tests. He was suspended from baseball 
for 60 days on June 28 for failing two tests and then, in September, he tested 
positive twice more. Because of the still unresolved player strike, Gooden had 
15 days remaining of the 60-day suspension.  
</P>
<P>
 Gooden's agent, Jim Neader, met with the pitcher for about an hour Friday at 
Gooden's home in St. Petersburg, Fla. Gooden chose not to speak publicly, but 
probably will make a statement next week, Neader said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's determined to beat it and get back to 100% health," Neader told the 
Associated Press. "And when that is achieved, then we'll think about baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 The Major League Players Assn. has the right to challenge the suspension 
through its grievance procedure, which would be heard by arbitrator George 
Nicolau. The union had no comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden has been a larger-than-life figure in New York. A multistory portrait 
of him on the mound is painted on the side of a building in mid-town Manhattan, 
visible to all exiting the Lincoln Tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
 After helping lead the Mets past the Boston Red Sox in the 1986 World Series, 
Gooden won 15 or more games in four of the next five seasons. He was 13-7 in 
1991, and hasn't been back to .500 since. He is the last Met from the 1986 
championship team. 
</P>
<P>
 McIlvaine, who has spoken with Neader about re-signing the right-hander, had 
only one message Friday: Get help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dwight needs to demonstrate that same degree of competitiveness to defeat a 
far more insidious enemy that is sucking the life out of him, both personally 
and professionally," McIlvaine said. 
</P>
<P>
 The last player to serve a one-year suspension was New York Yankee pitcher 
Pascual Perez in 1992. In 1988, Seattle Mariner John Rabb was suspended 
indefinitely for not complying with baseball's drug-testing program. In 1983, 
Dodger pitcher Steve Howe and the Kansas City's Willie Aikens also served 
one-year suspensions. Baseball and Drugs

NEW RULES ARE RADICALLY CHANGING THE NBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ARACE, HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The people who run the National Basketball Association have been thinking 
quite a bit about which weapons their fans prefer -- rapiers or broadswords. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapier is offense. It is thrust and parry, skill and smarts, daring and 
savvy. It is the stuff of highlights. 
</P>
<P>
 The broadsword is defense. It is sweat and grit, strength and will, stamina 
and machismo. It is the stuff of a common man well motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA season opens Friday, and for those who have neglected to watch an 
exhibition game, know now that this is supposed to be the year of the rapier. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fan, it will be the year of the midnight snack. There are going to be 
some long games, because there are going to be a lot of whistles, because a 
number of new rules have been adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of these rules represent a crackdown on physical play and fighting. 
Another group is designed to open the floor and make the game more conducive to 
scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter group will radically change the game: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The three-point line has been moved to a uniform 22 feet. From 1979-80 
through last season, the line was 23 feet, 9 inches at the top of the key and 
22 feet in the corners. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hand-checking, a tactic which has forever had the tacit approval of 
officials, has been strictly forbidden in the backcourt and above the 
free-throw line. Contact with the forearm -- from the wrist to the elbow -- is 
all that's allowed. And the elbow must be bent. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Below the free-throw line, one-hand contact is allowed -- but two-handed 
contact has been outlawed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- New illegal defense rules make it difficult to double-team because a 
defender can no longer drop below the free-throw line when his man is above the 
top of the key. That would be a technical foul. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Thorn, director of NBA operations, was a key figure in devising and 
implementing the new rules. Thorn said the new rules should produce two 
desirable results: No. 1, bring the NBA closer to the standards set by FIBA, 
the governing body of the international game; and No. 2, stanch the defensive 
methods that have been practiced since the Detroit Pistons began hanging 
banners. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember those loveable Bad Boys? Rick Mahorn? Bill Laimbeer? Dennis Rodman? 
Those fellows proved that Showtime can be bested by Slowtime. They bear-trapped 
the Los Angeles Lakers and Portland Trail Blazers and won back-to-back titles 
in 1989 and 1990. They set a trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "When defense gave a team a chance to get to the Finals, it became like 
anything else -- other teams were going to start playing defense," New York 
Knicks coach Pat Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago Bulls came along and won three consecutive titles. Granted, they 
were built around Michael Jordan, the greatest scoring machine of the modern 
era. He was showcased in the triangle offense -- a perfect device to take 
advantage of Jordan as a basketball god while allowing every other Bull to 
touch the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 But make no mistake: As lovely as the triangle was to watch, it was the Bulls' 
pressure-and-help defense, devised by then-assistant coach John Bach, which put 
the stranglehold on the Lawrence J. O'Brien trophy from 1991-93. Like the 
Pistons, the Bulls won with defense. 
</P>
<P>
 And then came last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Detroit used defense to win it all, Chicago did, and we got to the Finals 
with it," Riley said. "You start emphasizing that part of the game, things are 
going to get a little physical." 
</P>
<P>
 Broadsword basketball peaked with the 1994 NBA Finals, which pitted the 
league's top-rated defensive team (Riley's Knicks) against the fifth-rated 
defensive team (the Houston Rockets). 
</P>
<P>
 The series went seven games. The Rockets averaged 86 points and won. Rockets 
coach Rudy Tomjanovich compared it to winning a fight in the mud. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at the games and saw that the physical contact had gone to the 
outer extremes," Thorn said. "I'm not talking about the fights, but all the 
grabbing, holding and shoving was making it almost impossible to move from 
place to place on the basketball court." 
</P>
<P>
 The recently completed exhibition season proved that the rules governing 
physical contact will have the most significant and immediate impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players in this league are talented enough to start playing defense the 
way it is supposed to be played," Boston Celtics Coach Chris Ford said. 
"There's no longer going to be the grabbing, holding, wrestling matches which 
take away from the beauty of the game. I like the players having the ability to 
move out there on the floor. That's the way the game is supposed to be played." 
</P>
<P>
 The floor has definitely been opened. "Tactile contact" -- the rule-book 
reference to what used to be an allowable hand check -- has been suspended. 
Cutters have been cutting without impediment. Every night, ESPN has a new 
highlight of Pistons rookie forward Grant Hill throwing down an alley-oop dunk 
in Detroit or Magic guard Anfernee Hardaway ripping through the lane for a 
finger-roll in Orlando. The post has been freed. Even Celtics center Acie 
"Jurassic" Earl has been scoring (7.3 ppg). 
</P>
<P>
 Said Knicks teammate Anthony Mason, "The game has become sissified. Let us 
play. People started appreciating banging and defense -- it became a skill 
thing, offense against defense. ... If they leave things the way they are now, 
you're not going to have any choice but to make it work, but people are going 
to get bored with the games. It's going to get ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Anything the Knicks say must be taken with a grain of salt, of course. Harper, 
the hand-checkers' poster boy, was the featured star in the video the league 
produced to show what would no longer be allowed. Mason, for all his heart, has 
two of the heaviest mitts in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 It was their rough-and-tumble team that held opponents to 91.5 ppg in the 
regular season before contributing to falling television ratings in the Finals. 
It was their team that typified the defensive trend -- and spurred the league's 
rulemakers into action. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nature of our team is being a good defensive team, a hard, physical 
team," Riley said. "Because we got the most notoriety we (were targeted). It 
was always, 'The Knicks, the Knicks, the Knicks.' When (Bulls forward) Scottie 
Pippen was asked about the new rules, he said, 'This is going to hurt the 
Knicks."' 
</P>
<P>
 Riley believes the hand-checking rule should not have been thrown out, but 
modified to delineate between tactile "hand riding" and true impediment. He 
said the players would have preferred a stiffer hand-check rule to the new 
forearm rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're on defense, the only thing you have to balance yourself is 
these," Riley said, holding up his hands. "That one rule (banning hand checks) 
has changed dramatically how players have played their whole life. If they're 
going to take those (hands) away ... " 
</P>
<P>
 After a pause, a thin smile crossed Riley's face as he said, "(League 
officials) want points. And they're going to get them -- from the free-throw 
line." 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, Dick Harter should be introduced. He figures heavily in all of 
this. 
</P>
<P>
 Harter, 64, is a coaching lifer. Tough defense is his legacy. Of Harter's 
University of Oregon teams, John Wooden, the legendary UCLA coach, once said, 
"We don't want to go play the bullies in Eugene, Oregon." (Harter's "Kamikaze 
Kids" had ended UCLA's Pauley Pavilion streak of 98 consecutive victories, by 
the way. The 65-45 upset in 1976 was a defensive orchestration). 
</P>
<P>
 As an assistant under Chuck Daly from 1986-1988, Harter helped invent the Bad 
Boys in Detroit (before he left to become first coach of the Charlotte 
Hornets). As an assistant under Riley, it was Harter who nurtured the Knicks' 
"Tough Town, Tough Team" defensive mien from 1991-94. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is any one person the new rules are aimed at, it might be Harter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to claim any part of the rise of defense, but I don't know if I 
can," Harter said, a twinkle in his eye. "These new rules are not the 'Harter 
Rules' -- I don't deserve that kind of credit." 
</P>
<P>
 Now an assistant under P.J. Carlesimo in Portland, Harter is toeing the NBA 
line. "A number of very smart people decided that these rules will be good for 
the NBA," he said, "and as an NBA person, I give my fullest support." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he has some reservations. He believes, for instance, that 
the new illegal defense rules could produce the same isolation plays the league 
attempted to legislate away three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly the rules are aimed at adding more points to the scoreboard," he 
said. "I think sometimes when you aim to do one thing in a game you might lose 
in other areas. It's really too early to judge what's going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just like to point out that basketball is meant to be played both ways. I 
think you're supposed to be able to play defense as well as you're supposed to 
play offense. I think you're supposed to be able to play with strength as well 
as you're supposed to be able to play with finesse." 
</P>
<P>
 Harter said that one should not tinker with this balance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like people messing with it either way," he said. "I wouldn't like it 
if they tilted it too much toward defense and power, either." 
</P>
<P>
 Harter and many others associated with the NBA acknowledge that the rules 
changes were inevitable. The game needed an image change -- which can certainly 
be achieved by cutting down on physical play. 
</P>
<P>
 League officials are aware that scoring in regular season games dropped 17 
points between 1986 and last season. Defense became the best route to the 
Finals, if not the championship. 
</P>
<P>
 But why? If it was the rules, how was it that Elgin Baylor and Jerry West, as 
well as Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, ever had room to do what they did? They 
operated under the old rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what happened," Harter said, "was that expansion took its full grip 
about four years ago. If not for expansion, all those top players would have 
been dispersed throughout the league. Think about it. I'm not convinced that 
the scores would have been in the high 80s and low 90s if you added a top 
player to each of the final four teams last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's make this case: Put Penny Hardaway in the backcourt for either the 
Rockets or the Knicks. Don't you think that team would have averaged over 100 
points in the playoffs?" 
</P>
<P>
 That would have been one significant rapier added to a team of broadswords. In 
this day and age, it seems impossible to achieve such a balance. Rare, rapier 
talent has been dispersed. Broadsword defenses leveled the playing field. 
Another expansion is on the way.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; BOND RATES HIT 3-YEAR HIGH ON JOB REPORT; MARKETS: NEWS OF 
MORE EMPLOYMENT AND HIGHER WAGES CONVINCES MANY TRADERS THAT THE FED WILL RAISE 
RATES SOON, PERHAPS AS MUCH AS A POINT.

<P>
 Long-term interest rates rose to three-year highs Friday as the bond market 
was jolted by an unexpected tumble in October unemployment. The news seemed to 
squash any investor doubts that the economy expanded strongly into the fourth 
quarter. Traders said the most disturbing part of the report was the rise in 
average hourly earnings to $11.24 from $11.16.  
</P>
<P>
 Investor worries about rising interest rates and inflation also spread to the 
stock markets, which fell. The dollar also weakened after the Federal Reserve 
System refrained Friday from buying dollars as it did Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term bond prices dropped for a fifth straight day and yields soared to 
8.15%, the highest level since August, 1991.  
</P>
<P>
 The close belied the market's jerky reaction to the much-awaited job figures. 
Initially, bond yields dropped as traders greeted news that non-farm payrolls 
grew a smaller-than-expected 194,000 last month.  
</P>
<P>
 But the early move was quickly overpowered by more dramatic data showing the 
jobless rate declined to the lowest level since October, 1990. The report also 
shows the average hourly wage posting the biggest one-month gain since 
September, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 The report convinced some investors that the Federal Reserve Board may act 
more aggressively than previously believed to curb inflation pressures. Market 
strategists said a growing minority believes the Fed may push up short-term 
rates as much as a full percentage point when it meets to set monetary policy 
Nov. 15.  
</P>
<P>
 The market adjusted to that possibility by pushing up rates on existing 
short-term Treasury bills, whose value would be hurt by a rate increase by the 
Fed on new securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Stephanson, senior economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette 
Securities Corp., said the Wall Street firm believes there is a 60% likelihood 
the Fed will push up rates by half a percentage point and a 40% chance of a 
full-point hike. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that one could make a stronger case for a more aggressive move. Quite 
a few people are drawing that conclusion," Stephanson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting further pressure on bonds Friday were concerns that the market may 
have trouble digesting a fresh batch of notes scheduled for auction next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury plans to sell $17 billion in three-year notes on Tuesday and $12 
billion in 10-year notes on Wednesday in its quarterly refunding. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 5.31% as the discount rose 0.08 
percentage point to 5.18%. Six-month yields rose to 5.85% as the discount rose 
0.08 point to 5.62%. One-year yields rose to 6.34% as the discount rose 0.08 
point to 5.99%. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the 
interest at which they are sold.  
</P>
<P>
 Stock prices skidded Friday for the fourth time this week, weakened by 
inflation fears and rising yields in the bond market. The Dow Jones industrial 
average fell 38.36 points to 3,807.52, pushing its weekly loss to 123.14 
points, the biggest weekly decline in more than two months. Heavy use of 
computerized selling programs in the last 30 minutes of trading took the Dow 
sharply lower into the close. 
</P>
<P>
 "We attempted a rally and it failed, so then the traders decided to sell," 
said Michael Metz, chief market strategists at Oppenheimer & Co. "This is a 
market that has great difficulties with high interest rates, rising inflation 
and anticipation of a move by the Federal Reserve to tighten" interest rates.  
</P>
<P>
 Broad market indexes fell sharply as well. The NYSE's composite index fell 
2.45 points to 254.21. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slid 5.59 points 
to 462.32. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar declined as the Federal Reserve Bank of New York refrained from 
supporting the U.S. currency after two straight days of intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 97.50 Japanese yen, down 
from 97.71 on Thursday. Matt Porio, a vice president at Chase Manhattan Bank in 
New York, said dealers who expected the Fed to buy dollars again Friday were 
disappointed. They scrambled to sell the greenback, which pushed the currency's 
value down. 
</P>
<P>
 "People expected some sort of signal from the Fed, and when nothing happened, 
the day turned negative for the dollar," Porio said.

MIND OVER MATTER; MACHINATIONS OF A RENAISSANCE RECYCLER GIVE ARTFUL CREATIONS 
A HARD EDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Stepping into designer Mike McAlexander's Costa Mesa condo is to step into a 
shiny metallic, brightly colored, hard-edged world where nothing is what it 
first seems and everything started out as something else. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything in this house, except for one painting, I did myself in the two 
years I've lived here -- and that includes renovating it," says McAlexander, a 
high-energy contract designer who works under the name Vanderbilt and says he 
manages on about eight hours of sleep every other day. 
</P>
<P>
 When McAlexander bought the 2,000-square-foot condo, he says, it had orange 
shag carpeting, dark kitchen cabinets, patterned wallpaper and a black, 
wrought-iron staircase and banister. He ripped up the carpeting, bleached and 
painted the floors and covered them with area rugs, painted the walls white and 
changed the wrought-iron banister to a high-tech-looking one made from window 
glass, patio doors, large PVC pipe and iron stanchions. 
</P>
<P>
 McAlexander, who has designed everything from clothing to aircraft interiors, 
from eyeglass frames to packaging, says he sees design possibilities 
everywhere.  
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of the Dayton (Ohio) Art Institute, he envisions lamps in junk 
metal, tables in used sawhorses, cabinet knobs in sprinkler heads. After 
spending time with McAlexander, it's difficult to look at things in quite the 
same way again -- much less toss out something. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to instruct a class and show people how much is right in front of 
them that they can use instead of throw away. Forget what something is and look 
at it for its potential," McAlexander says. "I've done everything here strictly 
for my own entertainment, but I like doing it so much that I just may turn it 
into a career." 
</P>
<P>
 There is, of course, the danger of crossing over the sometimes-fine line that 
separates creative functional art made of recycled materials and a new piece of 
junk made from old pieces of junk. 
</P>
<P>
 McAlexander keeps the lines of his creations clean and simple. He engineers 
them to operate as smoothly as a piece of machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for example, the glass desk and wicker chair in one corner in the living 
room. The desk was made from sawhorses (covered with gold Mylar) topped by a 
slab of glass. A drawer was made from a picture frame; two aluminum extrusions 
on top of the sawhorses form the glides for the drawer. The inside of the 
drawer is covered with leather stripping; the drawer knobs are small 
candlesticks with plastic key-chain fobs glued in them. The wicker chair -- 
what he calls a "$3 deal" -- is painted black and has a tan patterned cushion.  
</P>
<P>
 "I like the campaign table look, a portable look," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love sawhorses; I always have. I have eight or nine pairs of sawhorses of 
different kinds. It all started when I was going to school. You had a bunch of 
guys living together, and they had big projects going on, so you used 
hollow-core doors on top of sawhorses for tables that could be put up and taken 
down quickly. It works great." 
</P>
<P>
 McAlexander usually begins with a germ of an idea.  
</P>
<P>
 "I first draw in my mind, then sketch for a while and then, when a design kind 
of goes in a circle and then settles, I know I'm there. I'll think, 'Bam!'  
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes there'll be a single component that starts me off. I'll walk 
around, look at it and wait for something to happen. Sometimes it does right 
away; sometimes it doesn't for months." 
</P>
<P>
 He credits his grandfather with nurturing his ideas and encouraging him to use 
his "Irish ingenuity. He led me to believe I could do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 One shape McAlexander enjoys working with is the V -- it is in his sawhorses, 
tripod lamps and clocks and in his design name, Vanderbilt.  
</P>
<P>
 His tripod series consists of old tripods, sometimes anchored by old gymnast 
rings, with clocks and lamps atop them on marbleized bases. He calls this a 
Teddy Roosevelt look, and the safari/army feeling is found throughout the 
house, with khaki background hues and bright chevron colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Humor and a sense of fun are among the strongest elements in McAlexander's 
condo. He seems not to take himself seriously, and it might be his relaxed view 
that lets his creativity flow. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the humorous items in his house is a punk rooster painted in red, blue, 
green and yellow that sits atop the bar between the living room and the 
kitchen. The bar is made from old shutters banded together, marbleized green 
and topped with a glass slab a neighbor gave him. 
</P>
<P>
 But it isn't just the obviously funny things that are humorous. It is the 
whimsy inherent in each piece he designs, even the serious ones. For example, 
it's hard to look without smiling at the butcher's block in the kitchen that's 
made from a backgammon board atop legs from a headboard that someone left 
behind at a swap meet. He marbleized it by using a European water-based stain 
in layers and 409 cleanser. "Sometimes the color I get is pure luck," he says, 
adding that he never does things quite the same way twice. 
</P>
<P>
 The kitchen floor is painted in a white-and-khaki checkerboard pattern; the 
cabinet doors are painted white, bordered with red tape and have green 
sprinkler heads as knobs. Using plain metal industrial shelf rods and glass 
shelves, McAlexander created a display area over the kitchen sink to hold his 
art-glass collection. The kitchen is separated from the rest of the house by an 
old window painted white. 
</P>
<P>
 The adjoining living room walls hold many of McAlexander's primary-colored 
paintings, which are bold and dramatic. The juxtaposition between the bold 
paintings and the furnishings in glass and brass makes for a sharp environment. 
The brightness of the decor has been softened somewhat with sofas and floors in 
neutral colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Upstairs are a room for watching wide-screen television and his working 
studio. This is where he keeps his raw materials and projects in the beginning 
stages. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can turn anything into furniture by adding legs," McAlexander says. "I 
took this old basket, put legs on it, painted it green and added a glass top, 
so now I have a table. I also have a place to store hundreds of glass frames 
that I've made." 
</P>
<P>
 In the TV room, he made small glass shelves in each corner and filled them 
with inexpensive plastic florist vases he bought and painted bright colors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like primary colors and fundamental elements -- that part of something that 
makes your heart pound. Too many things today are just manufactured with no 
uniqueness. I like to make things that are both utilitarian and beautiful."

LANDSCAPES; UNDERNEATH IT ALL, ARBORS ARE A LIVING REFUGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET KINOSIAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arbors and pergolas have long been popular in sunny, mild climates such as 
ours. They date to ancient Rome, where they were made of stone pillars and wood 
roofing covered with climbing plants to provide shade from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic idea hasn't changed much since then.  
</P>
<P>
 The pergola remains a place for letting the senses drink in the calm, the 
shade and the fragrance of the vines that grow all around. 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of a pergola is most typically a flat, open roof of cross rafters 
supported on posts or columns; an arcade is similar but has a rounded profile 
and is formed by a succession of arches. The general term for these and related 
structures that have plants growing on them is arbor.  
</P>
<P>
 Whether the framework is white-painted beams with scrolled ends or simply 
rough-barked poles, the unifying characteristic of arbors is the web of foliage 
they support, be it grapes, honeysuckle, bougainvillea, climbing roses, trumpet 
vines, pleached limes or wisteria. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arbors are very helpful in that they give the illusion of a 'hanging' garden, 
but you don't have to use hanging baskets, which can be passe and take a lot of 
extra care," says Jana Ruzicka, a landscape architect in Laguna Beach. Ruzicka 
likes to use grapevines, any type of climbing rose and "wisteria, of course, 
but with a large arbor and with age, it will become very heavy. Trumpet flowers 
are also beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 An arbor has significant advantages over a straight patio cover, Ruzicka says. 
"An arbor allows air circulation. There's a big difference between sitting 
under a solid roof or sitting under an arbor. The air isn't trapped underneath, 
and there's a certain unmistakable freshness." 
</P>
<P>
 Pergolas can be beautiful additions to a yard or the architecture of a home 
even if they don't have plants growing on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they can be built of many different materials, many are of wood -- 
particularly pine, redwood, chestnut, oak and treated Douglas fir.  
</P>
<P>
 "Round pieces of wood are best," says Ruzicka, "as the wood already has 
everything in nature it needs to protect itself -- water drains off it." 
Douglas fir can be sandblasted or sandpapered to help bring out the grain and 
texture of the wood. She says metal framing can also work well, particularly 
for very heavy vines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The wonderful thing about an arbor or pergola is that it has a sense of 
permanence," says Kathryn Rue of the Rue Group in Fullerton. "It's very much 
like an oak tree: You build it, and chances are it's going to stay there. It 
will bring you shade, but shade is many times a byproduct. I use arbors to 
create focal points or transitional spaces from the house to the garden." 
</P>
<P>
 Rue recently constructed a series of "rooms" in John and Sarah Farmer's 
Newport Beach back yard using pergola structures to simulate uncovered wall 
divides. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think this is a wonderful concept," Sarah Farmer says. "The spaces -- we 
call them rooms -- there's one for sun, with a chaise lounge and where my 
husband does his Tai Chi exercises; a dining area with table, chairs and 
umbrella, and a deck with furniture to look out at the sunset."  
</P>
<P>
 There are two arbors; one has a slate roof leading into a separate "secret 
garden" -- filled with ferns, foliage and a concrete garden bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Flooring under a pergola is important in connecting it to the house or 
surrounding garden. Sometimes it is possible to extend the flooring of the 
nearest indoor room, which gives a very strong tie. Other possibilities are 
batten, colored concrete, brick or flagstone. 
</P>
<P>
 Openings must be left near the poles for planting vines if the pergola is to 
have foliage. 
</P>
<P>
 Perennial favorites for use on arbors are Clementis, trumpet vines, yellow 
jasmine, passion fruit, honeysuckle, wisteria, bougainvillea and, of course, 
climbing roses. 
</P>
<P>
 Some suggestions for roses: 'Iceberg,' a white rose; 'Joseph's Coat,' which 
comes in a variety of colors; 'New Dawn,' a rosy-color climber; 'Bell of 
Portugal,' a pinkish-white rose that does tend to become a bit unmanageable 
when it's older, and 'Golden Showers,' a popular arbor rose. 
</P>
<P>
 Maintenance of arbor vines is minimal: Roses do not have to be cut back in the 
same manner as in a rose bed. Bougainvillea, which often becomes dead 
underneath, will have to be cleaned up from time to time. But on the whole, 
maintenance is fairly free. 
</P>
<P>
 Veiling the pergola with netting will add shade and catch falling leaves. 
General-use nursery cloth is inexpensive and typically comes in a plain weave 
or with a pattern of squares. It is available in many colors, but black is the 
most popular choice.  
</P>
<P>
 Even if you don't have plants on your pergola, it gives a nice, finished look 
and uniform shade. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very natural appearance to have a cut-branch arbor and shaded nursery 
cloth," Ruzicka says. "Plants and vines are great, but they don't always have 
to be in the design." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although a sense of permanence is something a pergola often imparts, it 
doesn't necessarily have to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Rue has come up with a "portable" arbor. 
</P>

 "I wanted something simple, not too expensive, that people could say, 'hey, I 
could even do that,' " explains Rue. She took large, designed terra-cotta pots 
and stationed the footings of the pergola inside the pots. "The idea of a 
transportable arbor kills just about everyone who sees it, and then they want 
to know how they can go about creating a similar one."

 Whether free-standing or an integral extension of the architecture of a house, 
pergolas have become a permanent part of the Southern California landscape.

A HELPING HAND: INSIDE & OUT; CEDAR CLOSETS SMELL GREAT BUT DON'T WORK WELL IN 
WEST 
</P>

 Q. While visiting the Midwest, I saw a home with a closet that was lined with 
cedar particle board. I would think this would be easier to install than the 
small pieces of cedar available at most hardware stores. Is it as effective? 
</P>
<P>
 B.W., Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 A. You may be disappointed with a cedar closet, says Jan Schaffer of Closet 
Gallery in Orange. Many people believe that it wards off moths, but that's 
never been shown to be true. And while cedar gives off a great scent, what 
you're smelling is the oil in the wood, which, after a year or so in our dry 
climate, fades away. You may be better off with a less expensive closet and 
some cedar blocks to give you the scent. When the blocks dry out, you can sand 
them down to release more of the scent.

 Q. We have Mexican pavers in our kitchen that haven't been sealed correctly. 
Now they have many stains on them. What can be used to clean them properly, and 
can it be done easily? 
</P>
<P>
 S.K., Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
 A. This kind of tile requires an acid wash before it's sealed, says Gloria 
Richey of Tile Importers in Anaheim. Because you're working with acid, you'll 
really need to know what you're doing. If you're not sure, you may need to let 
a professional do the job. Basically, you use a solution of one part phosphoric 
acid to 10 parts water. You need to brush that over the pavers and rinse it 
off, then let it dry out for a few days to allow any moisture to evaporate. The 
wash should remove most of the stains. After it's completely dried out, apply a 
water-based sealer to protect the floor. 
</P>

<P>
 Q. We'd like to paint our kitchen cabinets white. However, I want to use an 
alkyd-based paint, and I don't want yellowing after a few years. Can I coat the 
paint with something to prevent yellowing? 
</P>
<P>
 W.W., Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 A. It's a fact of life that alkyd- or oil-based paints yellow with age, and 
there's not much you can do to prevent that, says Joe Ragsdale of Color Center 
in La Mirada. Because pure white has little or no pigment, it appears to turn 
yellow faster. If you're determined to go with a pure white, you may have to 
switch to a latex enamel. Otherwise, you may want to try an off-white, which 
won't make quite as dramatic a color change as pure white. 
</P>

<P>
 Q. We're thinking about doing a little remodeling in our bathrooms and 
replacing the old tub and shower enclosures. We'd like to have clear glass 
doors but have heard they're not as safe as the ones of textured glass. Is that 
true? 
</P>
<P>
 C.S., La Palma 
</P>
<P>
 A. No, enclosures for tubs and showers are all made with tempered safety glass 
regardless of the style, says Debbie Mundt of College Glass & Mirror in 
Anaheim. This type of glass is four to five times stronger than regular glass 
of the same thickness. If you're concerned about safety, consider a framed 
unit, as opposed to the unframed style, but good quality enclosures of any 
style are generally safe. Clear glass is popular because it shows off the tile 
in your shower and makes the bathroom appear larger. However, because water 
spots are more visible, you have to take care to clean it regularly. 
</P>

<P>
 Q. We have a brick floor in our powder room, and the grout around the toilet 
seems damp at times. I've had a new seal installed on the toilet, and the walls 
and floors have been checked for leaks, but none have been found. Any ideas? 
</P>
<P>
 E.T., Lake Forest 
</P>
<P>
 A. First, check that water isn't leaking on the outside of the toilet, says 
Ted Blanke of Central Plumbing & Heating Supply in La Habra. There may be a 
hairline crack in the tank or a problem with the supply line. If not, the seal 
may not be working because the closet ring could be set too high above the 
floor, compressing the wax seal too much. Also, check for water entering 
through the two bolt holes at the base of the toilet.

 Time as art is the premise behind the glass enameled clocks made by Shell 
Weinberg of Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinberg, whose clocks have a modern, geometric feel, developed his knack for 
enameling after taking a class in the technique at Saddleback College in 
Mission Viejo. He then experimented with different designs and colors, seeking 
a unique product. 
</P>
<P>
 Enameling is the process of applying powdered colored glass to a piece of 
prepared metal that is fired until the glass melts and fuses to the metal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only do you get a nice clock, but something that is nice to look at, 
too," said Weinberg, who was a printing salesman and graphic designer before 
semi-retiring a couple of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinberg can customize timepieces to complement any wallpaper, drapery or 
upholstery material, dinnerware or logo. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinberg's clocks, which start at $25, come in several sizes and shapes 
(5-inch to 8-inch circles, rectangles and squares). 
</P>
<P>
 They can be purchased at Country Life, Design Center South in Laguna Niguel, 
Laguna Gander in Laguna Beach or by calling Weinberg at (714) 581-8481. HOG

 After headin' out on the highway, bring the spirit of Harley-Davidson inside 
with Dakotah's latest collection, featuring some of the motorcycle company's 
most famous machines. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legend Comes Home collection includes a faux leather duvet, complete with 
studs and fringe. The only thing missing is the wind at your back. 
</P>
<P>
 The duvet, made of a synthetic fabric introduced to the market within the past 
year, is available in king (about $450) and full/queen (about $320). 
</P>
<P>
 "The fabric looks, feels and breathes like leather," said George Whyte, 
chairman and chief executive officer of Dakotah, which is based in Webster, 
S.D. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the (buyers' mart), no one knew the difference between the faux leather 
and the real leather that was used for the fringe." 
</P>
<P>
 Easy riders can complete their look with accessories such as saddlebag shams, 
toss pillows, footstools and triple-thick, Jacquard-weave throws, ranging from 
about $15 to $1,000, with some limited editions. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection can be purchased in Orange County at Harley-Davidson 
dealerships, specialty shops and some department stores. FLOOR SHOW

 A little artistry can make a difference, even in carpet, says sculptor/carver 
Victoria Carkey. 
</P>
<P>
 Using specialized tools, Carkey, 32, can create most anything -- a logo, 
floral arrangement, even a Mercedes-Benz from a poster -- in carpet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Virtually anything drawn on paper can be carved into carpet," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her techniques, popular in Europe, were introduced to the United States about 
five years ago by Volker Bauerle, owner of the Carpet Sculpture Gallery in 
Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 Bauerle, who was born in Germany, not only trained Carkey, but also developed 
the tools that Carkey uses for sculpting. 
</P>
<P>
 Using only the plushest of piles, Carkey says she spends about 40 hours on an 
average-size rug, about 10 hours on a small one. 
</P>
<P>
 The techniques are hand carving and bas relief, which involves lowering or 
removing entire areas of the carpet to create highlights, shadows and a 
three-dimensional effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Sculpting is "like working with a pattern," Carkey said. "I usually make a 
template, then begin carving the design." 
</P>
<P>
 Prices vary from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, depending on the 
size and intricacy of the work. 
</P>
<P>
 For information, call Carkey in San Diego County at (619) 660-1318, or the 
Carpet Sculpture Gallery, 510A W. Central Ave., Brea, (714) 671-7712.

DO IT YOURSELF: OVERBUILD SHELVES TO PREPARE FOR WEIGHTY FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most of us share a problem -- lack of storage space. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the size of homes, there never seems enough room to store 
everything. This is especially true for condominium and apartment dwellers. 
Somehow, the longer you live in the same place, the worse the problem gets. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, easy-to-build shelving systems offer an effective, inexpensive 
remedy for the do-it-yourselfer. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelving materials are available at lumberyards and home centers. Shelves are 
most commonly made from particleboard, plywood or solid lumber and are either 
three-fourths or 1 1/2 inches thick. 
</P>
<P>
 Edge treatments are often applied to shelves for appearance. They can conceal 
exposed plywood edges, add rigidity and increase the shelf's load capacity or 
simply create a decorative detail to dress up the room. 
</P>
<P>
 The exact shelf design you choose is determined by the weight of the items 
being stored and the look you desire. But remember, you might also want to 
store heavier items in the future, so it's always better to slightly overbuild 
the shelves to prevent sagging and possible collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 The maximum span between supports for each shelf varies with the load and the 
material. 
</P>
<P>
 As a general rule, three-fourths-inch particleboard 10 inches wide can handle 
a load of 30 pounds per linear foot with supports 24 inches apart. You can 
stretch this span to 32 inches for three-quarter-inch plywood or solid lumber 
and to as much as 60 inches for 1 1/2-inch lumber or plywood. 
</P>
<P>
 If the shelf is reinforced with 3/4-by-2-inch-wide stiffener along the front 
edge and a 3/4-by-2-by-6-inch-long support cleat under the rear of the shelf at 
the middle, you can increase these spans by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 When appearance is not the controlling factor -- utility shelves in the 
basement, garage or workshop, for example -- No. 2 common pine is quite 
suitable. 
</P>
<P>
 This grade pine has knots of various sizes, so be sure to handpick the boards 
carefully to avoid loose or oversized knots that would weaken the shelves. If 
the pine is to be painted, first seal each knot with shellac to keep it from 
showing through. 
</P>
<P>
 Particleboard is the most economical shelving material and is often used under 
a plastic laminate. The disadvantage of particleboard is that it's heavy and 
tends to sag if it isn't supported properly. 
</P>
<P>
 When the look of fine hardwood shelves is desired, choose hardwood-veneer 
plywood. This cabinet-grade plywood is less expensive and lighter than solid 
hardwood and it's warp-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, extra-wide plywood shelves are made easily without having to edge-join 
several boards together. Conceal the plywood's exposed edge with veneer tape, 
trim, or a molding. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelves can be installed as permanent fixtures in the cabinet or as separate 
components that can be adjusted or removed, if necessary.  
</P>
<P>
 Large cabinets or cabinets without backs often have several adjustable shelves 
and one fixed shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 This fixed shelf adds rigidity and strength to the assembly. Fixed shelves for 
small, lightweight cabinets can be attached with simple butt joints using glue 
and screws. 
</P>
<P>
 However, for a much stronger assembly, you should use dado joints -- slots in 
the end supports -- to install permanent shelves.

FEW CONTROLS OVERSEE STATE HUMANE OFFICERS; LAW ENFORCEMENT: OFFICIALS MAY 
CARRY GUNS AND MAKE ARRESTS, BUT THEY OPERATE VIRTUALLY UNREGULATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When Capt. Barbara Fabricant ordered that Steven Hazzard give up his beloved 
seeing eye dog, Starsky, while she investigated allegations that he kicked the 
animal, the blind computer programmer balked, but obliged out of deference to 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Fabricant had neither interviewed Hazzard nor examined Starsky to 
determine if the charges were founded, she was, after all, not only a state 
humane officer, but "director of criminal investigations." 
</P>
<P>
 And Guide Dogs for the Blind, the Bay Area group that trained Starsky, told 
Hazzard that Fabricant had threatened to haul in their executives on felony 
charges, too, if he didn't cooperate. So Hazzard, of Westchester, spent the 
next five months unemployed and mostly homebound, without his "eyes" and his 
best friend. 
</P>
<P>
 What Hazzard and the guide dog association didn't know was that the 
.357-magnum-toting, uniform-wearing "Capt." Fabricant is a strange sort of cop, 
one of a little-known group of non-governmental peace officers. 
</P>
<P>
 They are authorized by the state of California to carry guns, conduct criminal 
investigations and make arrests throughout the state. They can wear uniforms 
and badges nearly identical to those of highway patrol officers. Yet despite 
the powers conferred on them under an obscure civil code, a Times investigation 
has found that humane officers such as the 68-year-old Fabricant operate 
virtually unregulated and unsupervised. 
</P>
<P>
 They are nominated for their positions by private animal-welfare organizations 
-- which can be founded by a single person -- and in many cases are given 
badges and authorized to carry guns, with little or no training. They are on no 
government payroll. They belong to no police department. They have no chief. 
</P>
<P>
 No government agency supervises them, or even keeps track of who they are or 
how many of them are out there -- not even the California Department of 
Justice, which oversees the professional qualifications of other peace officers 
throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary," said Norman Boehm, executive director of the state Justice 
Department's Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST), in a 
recent interview. Like other state officials, he said he was unaware of the 
police powers and lack of oversight on such officers until asked about them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what they're doing. Who in the world is out there carrying guns? 
. . . I have no idea where they get their authority. You need a job with a 
government organization in order to act as a peace officer." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, according to Civil Code 607f, you don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the code, private animal-welfare groups submit names of humane officer 
candidates to the presiding judge of the county's Superior Court for approval. 
They pay a $5 fee and need only 12 hours of training in animal care and a 
course in state humane laws within a year of receiving the badge. (Fabricant 
holds classes at her Canoga Park home.) 
</P>
<P>
 If training isn't available within 100 miles, the law says they are exempt 
from even that training requirement, as are people who became officers before 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
 And all it takes to slap on a gun belt and carry a weapon is an introductory 
firearms course available from community colleges, a course that Boehm said 
"amounts to nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Their fingerprints are sent to Sacramento for a cursory Justice Department 
check for a criminal record. After that, they're on their own until they have 
to reapply three years later. 
</P>
<P>
 The records of state humane officers' identities are kept in each county's 
principal courthouse or recorder's office. State officials say they have no 
idea how many there are, or who they are. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any oversight," said Michael Van Winkle, spokesman for the 
Justice Department's law enforcement division. "No one here is aware of any." 
</P>
<P>
 Humane officers have been around for more than 80 years, throwbacks to a time 
when cities and counties had nobody trained or available to investigate 
complaints of animal abuse, poisoning and theft. Local humane societies were 
authorized to provide deputies to fill the gap. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many California counties and most large cities now have paid, 
professional animal control officers, the humane officers linger as "one of 
those loose things from way back in history," said Darrell Stewart, a former 
state highway patrolman and current spokesman for POST, which sets standards 
for all law enforcement officers in the state.  
</P>
<P>
 After a lobbying effort aided by protests from organizations for the blind 
over Hazzard's loss of Starsky, a private association of state humane officers 
persuaded the state Legislature this summer to enact stricter training 
requirements effective next year. But some critics, even some animal rights 
groups themselves, say much more needs to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a lot of these loose cannon people . . . all of these Lone Rangers 
running all around the state," said the Los Angeles Society for the Prevention 
of Cruelty to Animals' new executive director, Madeline Bernstein. "We need to 
wipe out these gun-toting people who are out there claiming to be officers. . . 
. Who the hell knows whether they've gotten all the credentials or not?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone and their mother wants to be a humane officer," she added, "so they 
can go out and carry a gun and shoot people who are mean to animals." 
</P>
<P>
 Fabricant says she agrees. "I want all this exposed," she said Friday. "Take 
away the right to carry a gun, and you will eliminate 90% of the phonies. And 
then only people who want to help animals will be humane officers." 
</P>
<P>
 Humane officers are not required to go through the rigorous background checks 
and psychiatric evaluations that conventional police forces employ to weed out 
potential problem officers, Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need those people to be absolutely stable, of sound mind," said Stewart. 
"It's frightening if through loose regulations, inappropriate people are 
carrying firearms. It's bad enough in rural areas, let alone urban ones." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, court documents and interviews show that humane officers have been 
accused of overstepping their authority, ruining crime scenes and evidence and 
generally confusing and confounding other law enforcement efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne and Barbara Chronister are suing one of Fabricant's former deputies for 
the return of cats seized in a raid on their Riverside County home last year. 
In another raid months earlier on the family's previous home in Glassell Park, 
one of Fabricant's lieutenants, news media in tow, arrested Barbara 
Chronister's daughter and seized dozens of animals that the officer and 
Fabricant suspected were being abused. 
</P>
<P>
 He "put (the daughter) in the clink" on suspicion of animal cruelty, Fabricant 
said. Police freed the woman that night, but misdemeanor charges are pending 
against her. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Adams, an attorney for the Chronisters, said the family has been 
terrorized by Fabricant's group and other animal rights activists. "They want 
to have their own arm of the law. Some animal rights groups are utilizing these 
officers as their own personal posses," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams said Fabricant approached her several years ago, saying Adams' legal 
expertise would make her a good addition to Fabricant's humane officer team. 
"She tried to hire me, and she never met me before. She said if I wanted to 
carry a gun and badge and wear a uniform, I could," Adams said. Fabricant 
confirms she tried to recruit Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 When humane officers who had worked with Fabricant appeared at a city Board of 
Animal Regulation Commission meeting several months ago on the matter, one was 
ejected for carrying an illegally concealed firearm, according to a city 
official who was present. 
</P>
<P>
 During last year's Malibu/Calabasas fire, as firefighters were frantically 
trying to evacuate residents from the area ahead of the onrushing flames, 
Fabricant asked a radio station to broadcast appeals summoning equestrians with 
horse trailers to the fire line to help rescue panicked horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fire departments kept saying, 'Who is doing this?' (Other law enforcement) 
organizations kept saying they didn't know," said one official familiar with 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabricant responded that she never knew emergency officials were upset by her 
actions. "We personally transported over 1,000 horses, not to mention cats, 
dogs, birds, you name it. If we had not been there, what would have happened to 
all those animals?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Jan. 17 earthquake, Fabricant, in full uniform, held a news 
conference outside the city's West Valley Animal Shelter, urging viewers not to 
turn over to city officers any of the hundreds of panicked pets running loose 
from their homes because "most people do not trust Los Angeles animal 
shelters." 
</P>
<P>
 City animal control officers, who have butted heads with Fabricant for years, 
were irate. They said they received complaints that Fabricant and her aides 
were themselves collecting lost dogs and cats, and keeping them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we are working our butts to the bone, understaffed, trying to unite 
people with their pets," said Lt. Richard Felosky, then a supervisor of the 
city Animal Regulation Department for the West Valley. "It was an unbelievable 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Fabricant said they only confiscated dogs and cats that looked as though they 
didn't have owners. "We picked up 53 dogs from the various parks," she said. 
She said she simply took some of them home with her while she looked for their 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "My house was a mess," Fabricant said. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there are many humane officers who go through far more training 
than the law requires, such as the officers of the Los Angeles SPCA. Other 
humane groups, such as those in Glendale and Marin County, voluntarily forbid 
their officers to carry guns unless they are headed for a dangerous 
neighborhood or may need the gun to put an injured animal out of its misery. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we need to, we can contact the police," said Glendale Humane Society 
director Michael Peatrowsky, whose officers rarely carry guns. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are many others who secure nominations from small, little-known 
organizations, according to leaders of some other animal welfare groups and 
officers of official agencies, like the city Animal Regulation Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are well-meaning but radical animal rights activists, said Bernstein of 
the L.A. SPCA, which has its own crew of humane officers. 
</P>
<P>
 County records obtained by The Times show that Fabricant has used her status 
as head of an animal rights organization named the Humane Task Force to create 
her own posse of gun-toting deputies that include lawyers, doctors, 
contractors, actors and a retired watch repairman. The group, which Fabricant 
runs out of her home, has in the past year asked that 21 more persons be made 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Los Angeles Superior Court official Georgene Nagamine: "Our job is to 
just send the forms up north for processing." 
</P>
<P>
 The origins of Fabricant's group are unclear except that Fabricant started it 
and then had herself nominated to be a humane officer, according to court 
records. She concedes that she made up her impressive title -- captain in 
charge of criminal investigations -- herself as she began to accumulate 
deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend told Fabricant, " 'You can't get much higher than captain,' " she 
recalls, "so I'm a captain." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of her deputies, Fabricant herself concedes, joined up just so they could 
"carry a gun, kick ass, make arrests and throw their weight around. People are 
wearing badges that have no damned business having badges and guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a scary situation," she agreed. "Let's say one of my officers shoots 
someone. I can be sued." 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent day out in the field, Fabricant acknowledged that she has had 
to "decertify" -- yank the badges -- of many of her own officers because they 
became problems. County records show that one of them was an ex-husband, John 
Toth. 
</P>
<P>
 Another one "had (police) lights all over his vehicle. He was pulling people 
over on the freeway, making arrests. . . . He was throwing his weight around. . 
. . I found out how devious people are, and what lengths they'll go to carry 
concealed weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 Fabricant said she doesn't know exactly how many humane officers she has 
working for her, or how many she has "decertified." 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to even think about all the dumb things I've done here," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 In at least one case, county records indicate that a Los Angeles-area humane 
officer suspended by Fabricant simply helped create another animal rights 
group, nominated himself to be an officer and swiftly regained his badge. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabricant, well known as a leader of psychics and fortunetellers in the San 
Fernando Valley, is the widow of Sid (The Squid) Fabricant, identified by 
police as an organized crime figure when he died in the early 1980s. One of her 
sons is in the Hell's Angels, she said, and the front door of her home bears a 
decal: "Support your local Hell's Angels." 
</P>
<P>
 She has equipped her 1977 Plymouth station wagon with red and blue lights and 
official "diamond E" license plates so that it resembles a police car and is 
exempt from state fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The courts sometimes send Fabricant convicted persons to carry out "community 
service" sentences, including one person Fabricant put to work trapping stray 
cats, according to city animal control officers. 
</P>
<P>
 One day recently, Fabricant responded to a complaint phoned in by an animal 
rights activist. Because she was wearing black stretch leotards, a tie-dyed 
blouse and sandals, she had to show her badge to persuade an Asian family that 
spoke little English to let her into their house. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding the badge to a peephole in the door, she said: "I'm a police officer. 
Policia. " 
</P>
<P>
 She said she often does wear her uniform at lunch time, because "If I go in 
uniform, we get half price. 
</P>
<P>
 And what of Hazzard and Starsky? 
</P>
<P>
 His troubles started when he was attacked on the street, Hazzard says, and 
several witnesses mistook the commotion for him kicking the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 After Fabricant ordered the guide dog association to confiscate Starsky, 
pending her investigation, its members examined him, declared that he had not 
been harmed and returned him to Hazzard. Fabricant called executives of the 
association, threatening them with arrest unless Starsky was re-confiscated, 
according to Hazzard's complaint in a lawsuit that he brought against the guide 
dog group to get Starsky back. 
</P>
<P>
 After five months and $25,000 in legal fees, a retired judge appointed as 
mediator ruled there was no evidence that Hazzard had abused Starsky and 
ordered him returned. Many witnesses testified in his suit to regain Starsky 
that Hazzard never so much as raised his voice to the dog, and would apologize 
if he accidentally walked into him. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazzard's lawyer, Mark Brylski, complained in his brief that Fabricant's 
handling of the case "reflects a lack of impartiality and professionalism and a 
willingness to use threats in order to obtain her objective. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 California is not the only state with law enforcement personnel like the state 
humane officers. Bernstein of the L.A. SPCA said she recently left the New 
York-based ASPCA after the board of directors became embroiled in scandal over 
their carrying guns, which she opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 New York, however, has a state agency that monitors credentialing of all sworn 
peace officers, from humane officers to transit police to fish and game 
wardens. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a central registry and they are on top of it all," Bernstein said. 
"There is no such thing here. It certainly would get rid of a lot of the crap 
if there were."

SLAIN GIRL'S FATHER TO BE LET OUT OF JAIL; COURT: JUDGE SETS CONDITIONS FOR 
RELEASE PENDING TRIAL. MAN WAS DRINKING AND CLEANING GUN BEFORE FATAL SHOT HIT 
HIS DAUGHTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge agreed to release a Costa Mesa man from jail as he awaits trial on 
charges that he fatally wounded his 15-year-old daughter while cleaning a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach Municipal Judge Craig E. Robison set two conditions Friday 
before freeing David Curtis Stinson, 39, on his own recognizance. Stinson must 
turn over his weapons to Costa Mesa police and enroll in an alcoholism 
counseling program. 
</P>
<P>
 Stinson's mother and two sisters held hands in court Friday as Stinson's 
attorney described his client as a good father and called the shooting a 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have this man stay in this cell after losing his daughter, especially 
after losing her by his own hand, is more difficult than any of us can 
imagine," Deputy Public Defender Ron Klar told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Stinson is charged with involuntary manslaughter for the death of his 
daughter, Collister. Authorities said the teen-ager was shot in the neck last 
week while the father was cleaning or checking a gun as the two talked in his 
room. Police said Stinson had been drinking before the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Klar acknowledged that there is evidence Stinson had been drinking. Stinson 
sometimes visited a bar two or three times a week, he said, but he denied that 
his client has any drinking problem. Stinson has never shown up for work at the 
Pacific World Cosmetic Co. in Costa Mesa inebriated or with the smell of 
alcohol on his breath, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities are awaiting the results of a blood-alcohol test to decide whether 
he was intoxicated the night of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Stinson, who kept his head bowed and eyes downcast throughout the proceeding, 
raised Collister by himself since the girl was 9 years old, friends and family 
said outside the courtroom. He often declined social engagements to spend time 
with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did everything he could for her," said Stinson's mother, Anne. "She loved 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 "She came before anybody," said Dana Johnson, Stinson's sister. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the shooting, Stinson had led a simple life that revolved around his 
daughter and his work, said his friend, Randy Gardner. Gardner said Stinson was 
noted for being responsible and down to earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't make sense that something like this could happen," Gardner said. 
"If the bullet hadn't struck his daughter, maybe they could have laughed about 
it in three months. I think we've all been in situations where something tragic 
could have happened. The lucky ones are still walking around." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Clyde Von Der Ahe agreed to the two conditions for 
Stinson's release from Orange County Jail, where the father has been held in 
lieu of $25,000 bail. Stinson was expected to be released over the weekend or 
Monday, depending on when the conditions could be met.  
</P>
<P>
 If convicted of involuntary manslaughter and an additional charge of using a 
firearm, prosecutors say, Stinson could face nine years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Stinson is scheduled to be returned to court Nov. 21 for an arraignment 
hearing.

EMBROIDERY SHOP SLAYER GETS LIFE TERM, NO PAROLE; COURTS: RELATIVES OF VICTIMS 
DESCRIBE ANGUISH OVER FOUNTAIN VALLEY KILLINGS OF 2 WOMEN. JUDGE MAKES SURE 
THAT DOUGLAS F. STANLEY WILL NEVER GO FREE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pamela Harrington wanted to wake up Friday morning and call to wish her mother 
a happy 54th birthday. Instead, she came to court to watch as the gunman who 
killed her mother and another woman was sentenced to life in prison without 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Harrington's mother, Joyce Stanley, and Terry Vasquez were 
shot to death in July, 1993, in part because their killer hated women. But 
authorities say Douglas F. Stanley, 58, also wanted Joyce Stanley, his 
sister-in-law, dead because he blamed her for his strained relationship with 
his own daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Harrington brushed away her tears as she recalled her mother as a 
loving woman who cherished her family. Joyce Stanley even put aside her fear 
and dislike of her brother-in-law to nurse him back to health after heart 
surgery and also raised the defendant's daughter while he embarked on his 
nomadic lifestyle, moving from odd job to odd job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be calling her today to wish her a happy birthday. But I won't be 
doing that today," Harrington told the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington said she suffers mood swings and nightmares about the last moments 
of her mother's life. She also expressed bitterness that her bills for therapy 
are mounting while Stanley will be fed, housed and clothed for the rest of his 
life and receive free medical care for his heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emptiness I feel is unbearable," she said. "Our hearts were broken." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington's husband, Robert, also spoke during the sentencing hearing, 
telling the judge that the murder has taken its toll on their marriage because 
he cannot help ease his wife's suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard and Nan Adelsperger, the parents of Terry Vasquez, recalled how their 
daughter touched everyone she knew. There was the time she helped save a 
neighbor from a fire, the work she did with a local Girl Scout troop and how 
she pitched in when the family was building a new barn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terry is missed by us each and every day," her father said. "Our hearts ache 
to no end." 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant's daughter, Lisa Gray, did not appear at the sentencing but sent 
a letter lamenting that the death penalty was not sought in the case. Gray said 
she is devastated that Joyce Stanley, whom she considered a mother, is not 
alive to see Gray's newborn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want him to know he has no family," she wrote. "No one loves him." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Molko told Orange County Superior Court Judge David 
O. Carter that Stanley deserved the harshest sentence. Deputy Public Defender 
Denise Gragg told the judge that Stanley's greatest punishment was knowing how 
he devastated his family. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge sentenced Stanley to life in prison without parole and added a 
consecutive 10-year prison term, virtually ensuring Stanley will die in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce Stanley, 52, owned the Fountain Valley embroidery shop where the 
killings took place. Vasquez, 41, was a senior employee. After his surgery, the 
defendant worked at the shop doing odd jobs but disliked taking orders from 
women, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Stanley fled after the killings and was captured in Colorado. At 
trial, he contended that he had amnesia and did not remember the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony at the trial depicted Stanley as a mean-spirited man with a bad 
temper who often threatened family, friends and strangers. When angry, he 
routinely plotted to kill people. During the trial, Gray testified that her 
father once told her that Joyce Stanley and Vasquez were on his "to kill" list. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a sentencing report prepared by the Orange County Probation 
Department, Douglas Stanley was married several times, physically abused his 
wives and "enjoyed inflicting pain and fear, especially on women." 
</P>
<P>
 The sentencing ended on an unusual note, with Judge Carter telling the 
families a tale from his years as a homicide prosecutor. At the close of a 
particular murder sentencing, the victim's parents thanked Carter. The father 
of the victim then went home and killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter said he offered up the story to the victim's relatives to urge them to 
go on with their lives. To do anything less makes "winners" out of killers such 
as Douglas Stanley, Carter said.

PLAYING DIRTY; CONTESTANTS BECOME ONE WITH THE MUD IN TUSTIN RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As he prepared to compete in the 13th annual Volkslauf Mud Run on Friday 
afternoon, 36-year-old Brian Hopp announced to his incredulous teammates: "I 
just want to finish without getting dirty." 
</P>
<P>
 Hopp, a Santa Ana firefighter, came to the wrong place. Most of the 2,000 
competitors who braved this treacherous 6.2-mile race crossed the finish line 
covered in mud from head to toe. 
</P>
<P>
 And no wonder. After running through two blimp hangars, being sprayed by fire 
hoses and scaling a series of walls, participants had the privilege of trudging 
through the quarter-mile-long "Rambo Death Ditch," which was filled with three 
feet of thick mud. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes you feel like a kid, getting all caked with mud," said John Gilpin, 
34, of Trabuco Canyon. "You get to go out and get dirty and it's OK!" 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 teams, with names like "Mudweisers," "Dirt Hounds" and "The Half 
Dirty Dozen," took part in the run at the Marine Corps Helicopter Air Station 
here. The order of finish was determined by the first five team members who 
crossed the finish line together. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made the course a little tougher this year because we had complaints that 
it was a little too easy last year," said Capt. Dave Heronmeur, race director. 
</P>
<P>
 No such complaints this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a survival course," said Joe Gilboy, 35, of Irvine, who added that 
it was necessary "to become one with the mud" in order to be successful at the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Garfield, a 30-year-old physical trainer from Los Angeles, said, "It was 
like rolling around in a pigpen. I've never seen so much mud. It was like a bad 
dream where you are running through quicksand with a monster chasing you." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The race drew a wide range of athletes, from serious triathletes to weekend 
warriors with beer bellies. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning team was a group of friends who called themselves "Temecula Mud 
Hens." They unexpectedly bested highly touted military teams with a time of 51 
minutes, 49 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had never run this before and had no idea what this course was like," said 
Mud Hen John Wagner, 27, of Temecula. "We are the Cinderella story." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, coming in near last were the struggling Mudweisers, who ran the 
course carrying a five-gallon beer ball. The team of six Marines finished in 
well over two hours. "Our goal was to empty this beer ball before the finish 
line," said Cpl. Kenneth Poppy. "I was able to run a lot faster once this thing 
was half-empty." 
</P>
<P>
 The muddy ditch at the 4.8-mile mark became a physical and psychological 
battle for many. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mud is my friend," 31-year-old Matt Rautt said repeatedly as he slowly 
trudged forward. "Mud is my friend." 
</P>
<P>
 After emerging triumphantly from the ditch, 23-year-old Christopher Parks let 
out a loud, Tarzan-like yell, then smiled broadly, revealing the mud caked on 
his teeth and gums. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other than having a 7-Eleven Slurpee, this was the most exciting experience 
I've ever had," Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Haggerty, 27, simply swam the length of the ditch instead of wading 
through it like most of his competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people were running up along the sides, but I thought that was kind of 
cheesy," said Haggerty, a member of the Navy SEALS team from Coronado, which 
took top military team honors and placed second overall. 
</P>
<P>
 After braving the ditch, weary racers had to climb a hill, then get down on 
their stomachs for the "low mud crawl." 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like a wet lizard," Marine Sgt. Donald Finn said as he slithered and 
crawled in the mud. 
</P>
<P>
 The race drew hundreds of spectators, most of whom carried cameras to record 
the painful progress of their friends or loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sucking up that muddy water looks pretty gross to me," 22-year-old Nicole 
Pandolfe of Costa Mesa said as she stood on the edge of the ditch. "I might try 
it next year, but just for fun. I'll be the one carrying the beer and the ice 
chest who comes in last." 
</P>
<P>
 Some competitors flatly refused to mug for their friends with cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm dying!" yelled Gigi Mitchell, as she neared the end of the ditch. "If you 
were in a bucket of mud, would you want your picture taken?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before the start of the race, some first-time participants admitted 
experiencing some butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not really an iron man," said Costa Mesa resident Mike Gilligan, 35. "I'm 
more like a tin man." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilligan's teammate, 44-year-old Gary Draudt of Dove Canyon, decided to take 
part in the event over his wife's objections. The couple were planning to leave 
on a 20-year wedding anniversary trip to Polynesia today. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife said, 'If you break your leg in the mud, just stay there because I'm 
getting on that plane without you,' " Draudt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Participant Erica Hawes' goal was "just to finish." 
</P>
<P>
 "I work out, but I wasn't training for this," said Hawes, a 21-year-old 
college student from Rancho Santa Margarita. "I do the Stairmaster at the gym. 
My friend conned me into this. I don't know if I'm going to be speaking to him 
when this is all over." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Buchanan, 25, of Irvine tried to remain calm as he waited to start the 
race. He had carefully applied silver duct tape around his waist and legs "to 
keep things from falling apart and filling up with mud." 
</P>
<P>
 After starting out strong and with a smile on his face, a mud-covered Buchanan 
had clearly lost his enthusiasm miles before the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think," he said, "that I've stopped having fun."

A SYSTEM IN JEOPARDY; LENNOX SCHOOLS SAY PROP. 187 IMPERILS AID PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA RICHARDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Maria Araujo and her husband, Juan, were out of work last December, their 
daughter's school, Whelan Elementary in Lennox, fed the whole family and sent 
clothes for the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have any money, not even to put clothes on their back, and we 
couldn't have made it without Whelan," said Maria in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 The Araujos and their three children, including the 11-year-old daughter who 
now attends Lennox Middle School, crossed the U.S-Mexico border illegally four 
years ago. But in the Lennox School District, where anywhere from a third to a 
half of the students may be illegal immigrants, it is standard policy not to 
inquire about citizenship status. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, if it passes Tuesday, would alter that practice, but it would 
also upset a school system renowned for its success educating immigrants, one 
of the most difficult populations to reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators from across the nation drive the gritty streets of Lennox to analyze 
the spotless school grounds in this unincorporated area south of Inglewood. 
They find that while 92% of the students speak no English when they enter 
kindergarten, most are bilingual by the time they leave for high school. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-graders have some of the lowest test scores in the state, but 
eighth-grade scores are only about 5% lower than the state average. The 
district's boss, Kenneth L. Moffett, was chosen as the national superintendent 
of the year for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping provide food and health services to destitute families like the 
Araujos is essential to the schools' success, say Lennox teachers and 
officials. Students who need to see a doctor or dentist get directed to free 
health care. Those who need clothing and food can get it from a school thrift 
store, for free if they have no money. 
</P>
<P>
 Lennox provides a variety of services for children partly out of compassion, 
but also because the extra help paves the way for better work in the classroom, 
school workers say. Hungry children, cold children and children with aches and 
pains do not learn well. 
</P>
<P>
 But students have to trust teachers and faculty enough to tell them that their 
families are hungry or without clothes, and jeopardizing that trust, officials 
say, threatens the bedrock of the educational process in Lennox. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now our kids see that we care about the whole person and they respond 
to that," Moffett said. "Proposition 187 completely undermines that trust we've 
developed."  
</P>
<P>
 The schools stay open into the evening, helping families translate documents 
and fill out forms for college or medical services. But it took years, say 
teachers and others, for typically suspicious immigrant families to trust the 
schools enough to accept help. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha, whose son was having behavior problems at Lennox Middle School, 
credits school officials with salvaging his life. The district helped place the 
boy in a group home for troubled people, and intervened later when a hospital 
threatened to have him deported. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what I would have done without them," Martha said. "They're the 
reason my son, although he has problems, is not on the streets in gangs or 
doing drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 It is that kind of relationship that many in the Lennox school community fear 
Proposition 187 would undercut. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is agonizing for us, because we've made such an emphasis on educating 
anyone who came through the door," Moffett said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's an immoral kind of position to say you're not going to educate a kid," 
said Larry Kennedy, principal of Lennox Middle School. "If this passes, 
everybody . . . is going to become distrustful and suspicious of the school -- 
and we've worked so hard to overcome that.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite his personal opposition to the measure, Moffett said that if 
Proposition 187 passes he will require teachers to enforce it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it becomes the law, then they'll have to follow it," he said. "I know that 
I'll have to have some meetings with the teachers and that they'll have all 
kinds of names to call me, but they cannot jeopardize their credentials. They 
have to be able to teach." 
</P>
<P>
 Many teachers, however, said they won't help enforce the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I will do is go on doing my job, which is to ask, 'Do you know your 
times tables?' not 'Are you a citizen?' " said math teacher Francisco Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
 In Linda Camacho's eighth-grade social studies class, about 30 students tried 
to debate the ballot measure recently, but a real argument barely developed, so 
strongly did everyone want to argue against Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, students said they would be miserable if it passed. If their teachers 
enforced it, they said, they would never trust them again. 
</P>
<P>
 "If teachers told on us, how could we trust (them) anymore?" asked Idania 
Lopez, 13. "Or if they told on, like, your parents, then you wouldn't want to 
come to school."

CITYSCAPES / LAURA A. GALLOWAY: THE PECULIAR ALLURE OF MAN THE RICH AND FAMOUS 
CALL CURLEY; 'SOME PEOPLE THINK HE'S A GROUCH, BUT HIS FRIENDS SEE THROUGH HIS 
TOUGH EXTERIOR.' 
</P>

<P>
 Curley Morrow -- gruff, toothless, 70 years old -- might seem likely to wander 
reasonably unnoticed through life. 
</P>
<P>
 But Curley, the caretaker and most-of-the time resident of the Zero One 
Gallery on Melrose, is one of Los Angeles' underworld celebrities, beloved by a 
wide collection of artists, rock stars and socialites. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of admirers is copious: it is said that rocker David Lee Roth wants 
to buy him false teeth, but Curley won't go to the dentist. An heiress who will 
remain unnamed once bought him cream for a hand rash. When the Blasters played 
to a sold-out crowd at the House of Blues recently, they finished the gig and 
promptly headed over to the gallery -- to give Curley a concert heavily 
peppered with Hank Williams, one of his favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 Just what makes him such an institution is something of a mystery. On most 
days, he can be found sitting in the corner of the gallery under a Bob Zoell 
painting, smoking Salems and drinking beer while watching a parade of hipsters 
pass through to look at the artwork. Always, his 3-inch television set and new 
cassette player are close at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Curley is not venerated for his chattiness. ("Getting words outta 
me is like getting words out of a turnip," he quips.) Take, for example, a 
brief interview on a recent Friday night: 
</P>
<P>
 Reporter: "What do you do around here on a typical day?" 
</P>
<P>
 Curley: "I don't do nothin' ." 
</P>
<P>
 Reporter: "What's your favorite TV show?" 
</P>
<P>
 Curley: "I got no favorites." 
</P>
<P>
 Reporter: "Favorite book?" 
</P>
<P>
 Curley: "I got no favorites, brother." 
</P>
<P>
 Reporter: "How much beer would you say you drink in a day?" 
</P>
<P>
 Curley: "No comment. I couldn't tell you . . . probably about a case a day." 
</P>
<P>
 But the taciturn Curley is getting his moment in the limelight this month, as 
the gallery stages an "All Curley Show," for which a number of artists were 
asked to render their impressions of Curley in honor of his 70th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is an art legend," says Mike Rosenfeld, Curley Show contributor. 
</P>
<P>
 Curley, born Arba Junior Morrow in Lancaster, Ohio, never saw it in his 
destiny to live surrounded by artwork. With a fifth-grade education, he quit 
school to work as a paperboy and later did a stint in the military that ended 
with an honorable discharge, according to the "Curley Timeline" that hangs in 
the middle of the show. He's drifted through a series of odd jobs: managing a 
pool hall, running a newspaper stand and cleaning out nightclubs. 
</P>
<P>
 What Curley fails to disclose about his life is frequently filled in by 
gallery owner and friend John Pochna: "He's read 'The Iceman Cometh' nine 
times." And: "He's into 'Wheel of Fortune.' " Or: "He drinks a lot of beer." 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people think he's a grouch," Pochna says, "but his friends see through 
his tough exterior." 
</P>
<P>
 It was when Curley was cleaning out the now-defunct Cathay de Grand, an 
infamous local punk rock club, that Pochna -- sick of the tardy rockers he'd 
hire to clean up after his gallery parties -- hired Curley away. "There were 
like all these punk rockers barfing and people breaking the toilets, and he'd 
clean it all himself," Pochna says. In addition to what Pochna says was a low 
salary, "He only got two beers." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, Curley could do the work of three rockers in half the time 
it took them to get the 3,000-square-foot gallery clean. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Inside Pochna's cramped back office, which doubles as Curley's sleeping place, 
empty cans of MeisterBrau and cigarette butts floating in plastic Winchell's 
cups crowd the floor. On the shelves are Curley's beloved Western novels, 
crunched between don't-ask oddities like Manischewitz chocolate macaroons and a 
book that sheds light on a kinder, gentler Curley: "Doris Day: Her Own Story." 
</P>
<P>
 One event that clearly pleases Curley is the art show honoring him, which ends 
Thursday. When the concept of a show to commemorate his 70th birthday went out 
to 40 artists, 40 agreed -- and then some. Told only to render their impression 
of Curley, three themes crop up repeatedly: Beer, cigarettes and The Essential 
Curley. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're my paintings. I think it was very fine of them," he says, nodding. 
"They're either gonna like them or they ain't." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that the "Curley Timeline" outlining the bare-bones facts 
about Curley's life hangs smack in the middle of the gallery, much of the 
artwork reveals just how little is known about this man with a penchant for 
spewing profanities at anyone bold enough to ask for one of his beers. 
</P>
<P>
 There are "Curley Preserves" -- a jar filled with dentures, stale beer and 
soggy Salems. There is a Curley beer can crusher and a "Curley Ant Farm," 
filled with yet more Salems. And in photographs, pen and ink and oil, there is 
Curley being Curley: smoking, standing, drinking and sleeping on his couch in 
the back office -- the only tangible facts that manage to pierce through the 
Curley Mystique. 
</P>
<P>
 In a pen and ink rendering by an artist known as the Pizz, a caricature of 
Curley stands grumpily with mop in hand. "I don't know Curley, but I like the 
Pizz," says Mary Ann Escalante, who bought the work. She has met Curley once, 
albeit briefly. "He didn't say much. He seemed just like that," she says 
pointing to her purchase. "Kind of grumpy." 
</P>
<P>
 For some, it is exactly the grumpiness that made Curley's approval even more 
worth seeking. "To connect with Curley is kind of hard," says Rosenfeld, while 
recalling Curley's reaction to his oil on canvas of Curley in an Indian hat, a 
can of Budweiser looming in the background. "It did give me a thrill when he 
saw my painting and he smiled."

LOCAL ELECTIONS / 44TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT ; HOGE ASSAILS RIVAL CAMPAIGN'S USE OF 
LETTER BY EX-WIFE; WOMAN SAYS PASADENA ASSEMBLYMAN'S GAMBLING ADDICTION 
CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR DIVORCE IN 1971. HE CALLS THE ACTION A 'DESPERATE PLOY' 
AND DENIES THAT HE EVER HAD A PROBLEM. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In campaign literature portrayed by the incumbent as a "Nixonian dirty trick," 
the ex-wife of Assemblyman Bill Hoge (R-Pasadena) says that he suffered from a 
"serious gambling addiction" that helped destroy their marriage.  
</P>
<P>
 The eleventh-hour allegation comes as Hoge is seeking reelection Tuesday in 
the 44th Assembly District while facing charges from Democratic opponent Bruce 
Philpott that he is a special friend of the gambling industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse racing interests, card clubs and a major Nevada casino have pumped 
$140,000 into Hoge's campaign treasury since 1992, records show. As a freshman 
legislator, Hoge wrote six bills to benefit horse racing or card clubs, casting 
a number of votes in favor of those interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge's receipt of gambling industry contributions helped earn him the No. 1 
spot on California Common Cause's list of first-term Assembly members who 
raised special interest money in 1993 when there was no election to pay for. 
</P>
<P>
 The contributions also pegged Hoge as being vulnerable to a challenge by 
Democratic Party leaders who are working to unseat as many Assembly Republicans 
as possible to ensure a Democratic majority and continued power base for 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
 A "Dear Friend" letter from Hoge's former wife, which the Philpott campaign 
was preparing to mail to 60,000 households Friday, does not mention that the 
marriage ended in divorce in 1971, nearly a generation ago.  
</P>
<P>
 "At that point in my life I was 22 or 23 years old," an angry Hoge, 48, said 
in an interview, denying that he ever had a gambling problem. "I didn't have 
enough money to be addicted to anything. This is a desperate ploy by a 
desperate candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On stationery that appears to come from American University in Washington, 
where Hoge's former wife, Nancy Flournoy, chairs the department of mathematics 
and sciences, she writes: "My ex-husband, Assemblyman Bill Hoge, had a serious 
gambling addiction during our marriage. It contributed to the failure of that 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is shameful that he would introduce legislation to allow card rooms to 
extend credit to others who have that same addiction. I am so sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Flournoy said she recalled times when she and Hoge would 
spend weekends in Las Vegas or Lake Tahoe and he would remain all night at 
gaming tables. She said she also remembered occasions when he would wager on 
horse races at Santa Anita. The Los Angeles Turf Club, which operates the track 
there, is one of Hoge's major contributors, giving him $31,500 since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill would get to the blackjack tables and become so fixated on them that the 
rest of the world would disappear," Flournoy said. "I was not happy with the 
prospects of that kind of activity." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, who met in high school and married in July, 1967, decided to break 
up after Flournoy wanted to attend graduate school over Hoge's objections, she 
said. He sought a more traditional relationship in which the wife remained 
home, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was for a combination of reasons," she said of the divorce, which was 
finalized in 1971. "It was the whole lifestyle issue. And it was him wanting to 
spend his time doing something I was not interested in." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both have remarried and have not spoken to each other since 1971, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flournoy said she placed a call to the Philpott campaign late last week to 
volunteer her support after her mother, who lives in the district, sent her 
some campaign literature. Flournoy settled on writing a letter for the campaign 
to use, she said, in lieu of making a contribution to the effort to unseat her 
former husband.  
</P>
<P>
 Previously, she had been a financial contributor to EMILY's List, a Democratic 
women's political fund-raising group, and Republicans for Choice, which backs 
abortion rights. Flournoy said she was a registered Republican until her 
concern over abortion rights caused her to change her party affiliation to 
Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Flournoy's offer caught the attention of top party leaders who wanted to 
verify her intentions and the validity of her letter before using it in the 
campaign. At Speaker Brown's request, the dean of Howard University's Law 
School in Washington met with Flournoy.  
</P>
<P>
 "I determined that she is who she said, she wrote the letter and she stood by 
what it said," Judge Henry Ramsey of Howard University said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hoge flatly denied his former wife's account that he gambled at casinos. 
"We're not talking bets at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for his interest in horse racing legislation, Hoge said it dates back to 
when he and his late father, Ken, bred and raced horses at Santa Anita years 
ago. "My dad and I did this together as a father-son activity," Hoge said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most controversial gambling bill Hoge wrote would have expanded 
opportunities for card rooms and opened the door for gambling on credit. It was 
vetoed by Gov. Pete Wilson at the urging of Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge defended a provision in the bill that would have enabled a city, without 
a vote of its residents, to annex an adjoining area with a card club. He said 
citizens could still persuade their city council to block such an annexation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He also defended the portion of the bill that would have allowed the state to 
enforce gambling debts. Opponents warned that it would have encouraged gambling 
by credit card. 
</P>
<P>
 "By golly, if you have gambling debts then you ought to be responsible for 
them," Hoge said. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to Hoge's charge that pulling his ex-wife into the campaign 
amounted to a "Nixonian dirty trick," Philpott said the disclosure is relevant 
because of Hoge's legislative record. 
</P>
<P>
 "It speaks to the credibility and character of a candidate," Philpott said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hoge accused Philpott of being a hypocrite for criticizing him while 
accepting money from Democratic political action committees that are recipients 
of special interest money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am right upfront telling the world where I got my campaign contributions 
from," Hoge said. 1994

DISNEY RESORT GOES BACK ON THE DRAWING BOARD; DEVELOPMENT: COMPANY CONFIRMS 
IT'S CONSIDERING SCALING BACK $3-BILLION PROJECT THAT IS ALREADY TWO YEARS 
BEHIND ORIGINAL SCHEDULE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael D. Eisner confirmed Friday that the company 
is considering scaling back its $3-billion Disneyland Resort because the 
project appears to be too costly, especially in the state's uncertain economic 
climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner declined to offer specifics, but said the resort might be built in 
phases or that Disney might have to reduce its "appetite slightly." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very complex issue," he said. "It can mean reducing in size, it can 
mean reducing in scope, it can mean changing the mix of the product. We're 
looking at all the different ways to make the project viable." 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner's comments were the first public concession by Disney that the company 
is seriously considering downsizing the ambitious project, which, as proposed, 
would include a 1,800-room hotel district, a lushly landscaped shopping area, a 
5,000-seat amphitheater, a six-acre lake and a new international-themed park 
called Westcot adjacent to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at all sorts of different opportunities and prospects," said 
Eisner, who was in Santa Ana on Friday for the grand opening of the Walt Disney 
Gallery at MainPlace mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at how to do a project like this in an urban environment and 
still have it be fiscally responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 The company's chairman said he still feels the financial sting from more than 
$550 million in losses from the Euro Disneyland debacle in France and is trying 
to make sure the same thing doesn't occur in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd just as soon not have the (Euro Disney) pain, even though I know that 
pain will turn to pleasure in any other part of the world, so we're trying to 
judge our appetite versus the economy and California has had a rather tough 
time recently," Eisner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner said the recent decision to abandon the Disney's America project in 
Virginia will not affect any decision in Anaheim. He also said the company is 
committed to developing other tourism projects in Orange County, will continue 
to put money into Disneyland and plans to decide on the Disneyland Resort "very 
soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's internal review of the plans, however, has further postponed the 
much-delayed project, which is at least two years behind its original 
groundbreaking schedule. Furthermore, Disney officials have refused to commit 
to building the project until they receive as much as $800 million in financial 
support from the city of Anaheim, Orange County and state and federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Anaheim city officials said their negotiations on a 
development agreement with Disney have been temporarily halted because the 
company's planners and financial analysts are trying to re-evaluate and 
possibly downsize the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just a time for re-evaluation and reassessment of the magnitude of 
the project," City Manager James D. Ruth said. "We think it's fine and makes 
perfect business sense. We're still very optimistic about this going forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, city officials say that regardless of Disney's plans they are still 
committed to move forward on a $172.5-million project to overhaul the urban 
clutter surrounding Disneyland and beautify the area by widening streets, 
burying utility lines and planting tropical landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the possibility of a scaled-back project has caused some concern 
among those in the local tourism industry, who are starting to see diminishing 
returns on a project that was once hailed as creating tens of thousands of jobs 
and generating $2.4 billion a year in economic activity statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, any downsizing could have some impact on our city as a 
destination," said Ned Snavely, the general manager of the Anaheim Marriott. 
"We'll have to wait and see what they mean by downsizing. It could take a 
number of directions. . . . The chances are that it might not be as exciting 
for those who would be coming into the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill O'Connell, general manager of four Stovall Best Western motels near 
Disneyland, said most hotel and motel owners are still optimistic about the 
project going forward and hope it "will be the boost in the arm" that the local 
tourism industry needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to see the very best thing that Disney can do, but we understand it 
has to work within their budget," said O'Connell, noting that Disneyland was a 
much smaller theme park when it opened than it is today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if they start with a smaller project, it can grow into something 
bigger," he said. "Obviously, I wish it would happen today." 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner said he appreciates the support Disney has received from city officials 
and the business community and hopes to "make a decision sooner rather than 
later." But "the worst thing we could do," Eisner said, is put "the whole 
project at risk" by moving ahead before the economics of the resort make better 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
 One plan under consideration, he said, is constructing the project in "phases" 
over a longer period of time than originally projected. "We've had a thousand 
different ideas," Eisner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of whether Disney builds the project, Eisner said, the company will 
continue to make improvements in and around Disneyland, its 39-year-old 
flagship theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the company is building two new ice rinks in Anaheim for its Mighty 
Ducks hockey team and community skating programs. Disney also is building 650 
Mediterranean-themed time-share condominiums in Newport Beach. At the park, the 
company is building a new administration building and is almost finished with a 
new thrill ride themed after the Indiana Jones movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disneyland itself has never been better," Eisner said. "No matter what we do 
we're never going to let Disneyland become an aging theme park. I still think 
it's the happiest place on Earth."

THREE LOCAL MEN JAILED IN MARIJUANA SMUGGLING RING; DRUGS: $17 MILLION WORTH IS 
SEIZED IN TANKS BUILT IN SANTA ANA SHOP AND SENT TO NEW YORK, SAY 
INVESTIGATORS.

 Three Orange County men were arrested in connection with a cross-country drug 
ring that shipped more than $17 million worth of marijuana in tanks assembled 
at an interior design shop in Santa Ana, investigators said Friday . 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys had a pretty sophisticated operation going," said Lt. Bob Sayne of 
the Orange County Regional Narcotics Suppression Program.  
</P>
<P>
 Since January, 7,000 pounds of "high-grade" marijuana were shipped from 
Soussan Interiors, 2950 W. Central St., to the East Coast, Sayne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sayne said Albert Gilbert Soussan, 39, of Laguna Beach, who owns the shop and 
a warehouse next door, Michael Arthur Flores, 36, of Garden Grove and Martin 
Ducay Scott, 34, of Anaheim Hills packed the marijuana into steel tanks holding 
400 to 500 pounds each, welded them closed and sealed them with silicone to 
prevent the odor from escaping. They then placed the tanks in larger polished 
steel containers that resembled marine gasoline tanks, down to the screw-top 
lid and the lettering, Sayne said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was very professionally done," he said. "In fact, we had to get the Fire 
Department to come out and cut through the tank." 
</P>
<P>
 The gasoline tanks were transported from Orange County to New York by 
commercial freight lines, usually trucks or trains. Once in New York, 
investigators said, a crew picked up the shipments, cut open the tanks and 
distributed the marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 The smuggling operation was unraveled after a shipping company became 
suspicious of the tanks, Sayne said. Since August, investigators have spent 
"days upon days just watching" Soussan Interiors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started noticing that the man who owned the business didn't seem to do any 
business," Sayne said. "Let's just put it this way: We didn't see a lot of 
clientele." 
</P>
<P>
 The last shipment, which left on Oct. 26, contained 1,000 pounds of marijuana 
worth $2.5 million, Sayne said. Orange County investigators, working with a 
shipping company used by the suspects, seized the contraband and had it flown 
to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents arrested Joseph James 
Fuggetta, 35, and Vincent Capece, 42, when they arrived to pick up the tanks in 
New York, Sayne said. Both are from that city. Maryland resident Steven Berman, 
35, also was arrested in connection with the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Soussan and Flores were arrested at their homes and Scott 
was arrested at the interior design shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Soussan and Flores were arraigned Friday on federal drug charges and remain in 
federal custody. Scott remains in the Orange Jail in lieu of a $200,000 bond, 
Sayne said. The men will be extradited to New York, he said, where the case 
will be turned over to the U.S. attorney's office there. They could receive up 
to 15 years in jail if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate case, sheriff's deputies arrested three men and a woman in San 
Clemente early Friday on suspicion of transporting and smuggling 175 pounds of 
marijuana.  
</P>
<P>
 Just after midnight, deputies in the 2400 block of El Camino Real noticed an 
older Ford Mustang, apparently out of gas, being pushed by a Pontiac, without 
lights or towing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 A records check indicated that neither of the drivers or vehicles were 
licensed, although both licensed plates had 1995 registration tags on them, 
sheriff's Lt. Tom Garner said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the drivers' permission, deputies searched the car, discovering $1,500 in 
cash, two cellular phones, two pagers and, beneath the floor of the Mustang's 
trunk, 83 packages of marijuana wrapped in plastic, Garner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four arrested and booked at the Orange County Jail were Juan Salman, 18, 
of San Diego; Abraham Sahaguin, 20, of Tijuana; Oscar Ramos, 29, of Tijuana and 
Clementina Mayorquin, 18, of Los Angeles.

(The base is scheduled to close at the end of the decade. The city is working 
with county officials to craft a redevelopment plan for the land.) Reuse ideas 
for the base range from building an air cargo facility there to converting it 
into a commercial district. Lake Forest and other South County cities are 
against converting the base into an airport, fearing the traffic, noise and 
environmental effects. Measure A on the ballot Tuesday asks voters if they want 
to build an airport at El Toro.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FULLERTON; BYSTANDER SLAYING NETS LONG SENTENCE FOR GANG 
MEMBER

<P>
 A 20-year-old gang member was sentenced Friday to 28 years to life in prison 
for his role in a shootout that killed a 15-year-old innocent bystander going 
on a church retreat with his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Loi Van Nguyen of Westminster was behind the wheel of the car when fellow gang 
members and a rival group began exchanging gunfire outside an Orange church on 
Aug. 6, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Lozaro Omar Acosta Jr., a Century High School sophomore and church choir 
member, was killed by a stray bullet while sitting in his parents' car, which 
was stopped nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were on their way to a church retreat. He was waiting in the car while 
his mom and dad ran into the convenience store for cough drops, cookies and 
other items to take with them," Deputy Dist. Atty. Robin Park said. "He was hit 
by a stray bullet." 
</P>
<P>
 Several other gang members await trial in the case, but the gang member who 
fired the fatal shot has already been convicted and sentenced to prison, Park 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen's defense attorney did not return a call seeking comment on the 
sentence, but he had argued at trial that the first-degree murder conviction 
was too harsh because his client never held a gun during the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, however, Nguyen is just as culpable as the person who pulled 
the trigger because he participated in gang activity that led to a killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Kazuharu Makino sentenced Nguyen to 25 
years to life in prison on the first-degree murder charge, plus an additional 
three years in prison on gang involvement and weapons charges. RENE LYNCH

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; A BATTLE OF THE BANDS AT IRVINE STADIUM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Irvine Unified School District is hosting its first invitational field 
tournament from 3:30 to 8:30 p.m. today at Irvine Stadium with marching bands, 
color guards and drill teams from 18 Orange County high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament is co-sponsored by Irvine and Woodbridge high schools.Music 
directors there hope to make it an annual event to help offset the impending 
loss of money from bingo games. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal law, which goes into effect Dec. 26, will prohibit smoking in public 
school buildings. Music boosters say the law will effectively end the lucrative 
twice-weekly bingo games in Irvine that have earned $60,000 a year for high 
school instrumental music programs. Most Irvine bingo players surveyed said 
they would not attend games where smoking is prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like there won't be any bingo, so we're hoping this tournament can 
take the place of that," said Joslynne Blasdel, director of instrumental music 
at Woodbridge High School, which purchased three $4,000 sousaphones this year. 
Booster groups raise most of money for the high school's $30,000-a-year 
instrumental music program. 
</P>
<P>
 The two high schools are hoping to raise $8,000 from the tournament, while 
established tournaments generate as much as $17,000, according to Woodbridge 
High music booster Paul Harvey, who is chairing the event with Terri Mitchell, 
president of the Irvine High music boosters. 
</P>
<P>
 At the tournament, the bands will present their football half-time shows, 
according to Bob Avzaradel, director of instrumental music at Irvine High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in school, you'd march around in a spot to the theme from 'The 
Love Boat,' " he said. "These kids work on a pretty high-tech performance."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; STANTON PRESSES ON FOR 5-DAY OFFICE SCHEDULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton on Friday continued to gather information 
and solicit support from department heads to bolster his campaign to reopen 
county offices every Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi, Transportation Authority Chief 
Executive Officer Stan Oftelie and Clerk Gary L. Granville said they are 
opposed to implementing any plan that would close their departments to the 
public every other Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our public responsibility to be accessible to the people we serve for 
all normal working hours," said Granville, who does not follow the work plan. 
"It behooves us to be open Fridays. . . . I'm kind of passionate about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, nearly three dozen county facilities, offering services such 
as welfare assistance, health care, building permits and tax collection, are 
closed at least 26 Fridays a year. Next year, Stanton said there will be 31 
weeks in which the county is open four days or fewer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote Tuesday on whether to continue 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no need to close your doors," Stanton said. "I think there is a 
manifestation of basic common sense coming forward now." 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi and Oftelie have some employees that work flexible work schedules but 
keep their offices open five days a week. Both said they have explored the 
possibility of opening some offices on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Oftelie said he is supportive of flexible work schedules that give employees a 
weekday off as long as there is enough staff to keep the offices open five days 
a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It actually makes us more accessible to the public," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton said he is also a supportive of that type of flexible work plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton's pursuit of the issue has made him the target of attacks from some 
county officials, most notably Board Chairman Thomas F. Riley, who questioned 
Stanton's work habits, suggesting that he is often away from the office during 
business hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton defended his work ethic, saying he is frequently at functions and 
meetings with residents during the week. He pointed out that he and his staff 
were in the office Friday, like they are every Friday, while his colleagues and 
most county employees had the day off. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisor said he received a letter Friday from the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District disputing the county staff's report on possible 
cost savings from ride-sharing programs. Also, he contended that the county's 
recent debacle over the expiration of assessment appeals might have been 
avoided if the county's appeals boards conducted hearings every Friday. MATT

 The politics of silence: As one of the few major officials in the state to 
take no position on Proposition 187, L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan has been the 
object of some jokes. His absence was noted when City Atty. James Hahn joined 
Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti and Sheriff Sherman Block Friday at an L.A. County 
Jail news conference to reiterate opposition to the anti-illegal immigration 
measure. Quipped Hahn: "Was I supposed to swing by and pick up the mayor?" 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 The curiosity factor wins out: More than 10,000 students walked off campuses 
in the L.A. area to protest Proposition 187 the other day, but only nine 
youngsters left Mt. Vernon Middle School -- believed to be the lowest total in 
the school district. A Mt. Vernon official attributed the small walkout to 
student interest in a visit that day by Los Angeles police officers, who staged 
a demonstration on the use of the department's dogs in drug investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacre orange!Joan Lappen of Pacific Palisades found an ad for "Ducking a la 
Orange" in a Catalina newspaper that would surely raise the eyebrows of a 
French maitre d'. Then again, it might be just the dish for Mayor Riordan.

 Unofficial economic indicator? 
</P>
<P>
 Norman Sklarewitz was a bit surprised to see that the First Professional Bank 
building on West 3rd Street displays a sign that says: "No Cash on Premises." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wonder if this says something about the lot of professionals these days," 
Sklarewitz commented. 
</P>
<P>
 We phoned the bank to find out. An employee assured us: "This is the bank's 
business office, a satellite office. We don't have tellers here." She assured 
us that the various branches of First Professional have plenty of cash on their 
premises.

 But do they award frequent taxi miles?Lee Solters says that on a Southwest 
Airlines flight to L.A., "the plane was taking an unusually long time taxiing

Airlines. We fly you halfway and drive you the rest.' "

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; JUDGE 
REFUSES TO REVOKE BAIL FOR RAPPER'S BODYGUARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge refused Friday to revoke bail for rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg's bodyguard, 
despite allegations by the prosecution that the murder defendant has committed 
other crimes and purchased a gun since the slaying. Superior Court Judge Paul 
G. Flynn ordered McKinley Lee, 24, confined to his home with an electronic 
device monitoring his whereabouts pending trial Jan. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Snoop Doggy Dogg, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, Lee, and acquaintance 
Sean Abrams, 24, were indicted for the Aug. 25, 1993, shooting of Philip 
Woldemariam. All three pleaded not guilty in the drive-by shooting that the 
rapper's lawyer says was self-defense. Prosecutors contend it was gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 The three men were released on bail. The prosecution asked Flynn to jail Lee 
pending the trial because the defendant allegedly lied on a federal firearms 
application form and purchased a gun after he was indicted. The prosecutor 
added that Lee was arrested earlier this year on misdemeanor marijuana 
possession and felony transportation of steroids charges.

<P>
 A 52-year-old man who suffered minor burns after a fire broke out in his 
mobile home was probably spared more serious injury because a smoke detector 
did its job, firefighters said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Freed suffered second-degree burns on his left hand Thursday night 
while trying to extinguish a fire that originated from a malfunction in the 
mobile home's heating unit, Newport Beach Fire Marshal Dennis Lockard 
said.Freed was taken to Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian, where he was 
treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire at De Anza Mobile Home Park, 300 E. Coast Highway, caused an 
estimated $100,000 in damages to the mobile home and $25,000 to its contents, 
Lockard said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For all intents and purposes," he said, "most of the structure and the 
contents were destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Lockard added, "The man was saved by a smoke detector." 
</P>
<P>
 Lockard said that Freed heard the smoke alarm from his living room shortly 
before 9 p.m. He attempted to control the fire with a portable extinguisher, 
but was unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 When firefighters arrived, they saw "a fast-moving fire with flashover 
conditions" that engulfed the dwelling, Battalion Chief Ron Sutherland said. 
</P>
<P>
 It took 34 firefighters from three cities to bring the blaze under control, 
Sutherland said. THAO HUA

 Should voters decide next week to pass Proposition 187, which would deny 
education and other public services to undocumented immigrants, opponents of 
the measure plan a demonstration Wednesday to urge educators, health-care 
providers and social workers to refuse to comply with its mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot have teachers and doctors turning into INS (Immigration and 
Naturalization Service) agents, denying services to people because of their 
color or race," said David Rojas, 22, a Fullerton College student who is a 
member of a coalition of Orange County high school, college and university 
student groups against the initiative.Organizers said the protest would take 
place at the Civic Center in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Some doctors and social workers have pledged to refuse to report suspected 
illegal immigrants to the INS. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Woo, a social worker and executive director of the Westminster-based 
Asian Pacific Community Services, said: "With all good conscience, I don't see 
how anybody could comply with that law. To turn someone in is not our function. 
We're not in a police state as far as I know. That's unconstitutional." MIMI KO

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VALINDA; SUSPECT SOUGHT 
IN RAPE OF 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies are searching for a man who kidnaped and raped a 
12-year-old girl in east Valinda. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, whose name was not released, was walking to school early Thursday on 
Azusa Avenue near Glenloch Avenue when a man asked her for the time, Sheriff's 
Lt. John Clark said.The girl tried to walk away, but the man had a gun and told 
the girl he only wanted to take pictures of her. He dragged her by the arm to a 
pickup truck and drove the girl to McLaren Street in Valinda, where he raped 
her and then drove about a mile and released her, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect was described as a Latino in his 30s, about 5-foot-5 and 140 to 
150 pounds, with brown eyes, short, wavy black hair and a thick mustache. He 
was wearing maroon sweat pants and drove a light blue GMC pickup with gray 
interior and gray lettering on the tailgate.

BABY BOY'S BODY FOUND IN POMONA BACK YARD; CRIME: PIT BULLS WERE KEPT AT THE 
HOUSE, BUT POLICE SUSPECT THAT THE MUTILATED INFANT WAS DEAD BEFORE BEING LEFT 
THERE.

 The mutilated body of an unidentified baby boy was found Friday in the back 
yard of a Pomona home where pit bulls were kept, but police suspect that the 
infant was killed elsewhere and dumped at the home.  
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the baby -- found near a rusting car in the littered yard of 
a working-class neighborhood -- did not live at the Orange Grove Avenue home 
where he was found. The cause of the death was not immediately determined, and 
many details remained unclear late Friday. But Pomona Police Lt. Ron Windell 
said: "It is our feeling . . . that the child was probably dead prior to being 
introduced into the back yard." 
</P>
<P>
 Lorraine Ruiz, 20, who made the gruesome discovery behind her two-bedroom 
home, said: "It's hard to believe that something like this could happen in your 
own back yard. Whoever did this had no heart." 
</P>
<P>
 The naked baby, between 1 week and 1 month old, had suffered head trauma and 
his testicles had been severed, police said. The baby also appeared to have 
been bitten, and one arm was missing, police said.  
</P>
<P>
 It was not known how long the body had been lying in the yard, which is 
surrounded by a chain-link fence. 
</P>
<P>
 An adult pit bull and her pup were in the yard of the home when the child's 
body was discovered by the dogs' owner. When police arrived, the adult dog was 
chained on the other side of the yard. The puppy, however, was roaming around 
the back yard. The two dogs were placed in an animal shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The baby could have been thrown over the fence or dropped on its head back 
there. We don't know," Windell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have no suspects and are asking anyone with information to contact 
detectives at (909) 620-2151. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacqueline Cowan, 24, a neighbor, said, "I think it's pathetic somebody would 
kill a baby when so many people want one."

S. AFRICANS TOUR BLACK LIFE IN L.A.; COMMUNITIES: MARIKE DE KLERK, WIFE OF 
NATION'S FORMER LEADER, AND HER ENTOURAGE VISIT SCHOOL THAT AIMS TO INTEREST 
AFRICAN AMERICANS IN SCIENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A few years ago it could not have happened: The wife of the head of an 
apartheid African nation could not have toured black Los Angeles without 
massive protest. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, Marike de Klerk's husband, F.W. de Klerk, is no longer president of 
South Africa. His title is executive deputy president in Nelson Mandela's new 
government. And so it was in a serene environment Friday that Marike de Klerk 
took a scenic tour of African American communities while her husband met with 
civic leaders in other parts of town. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles) hosted Marike de Klerk and three other 
South African women on a trip through Baldwin Hills and around the rest of 
Watson's 28th Senate District. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour, sponsored by the World Affairs Council, began with an early morning 
visit to the African American Male Achievers Network's Science and Discovery 
Learning Center, created to teach black youths about science. 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk chatted with children such as 11-year-old Justin Walker, who pointed 
out how his project, a red rocket, worked. She also invited the program's first 
graduate, Ben Osborne, 16, to come to South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to know that we can have an effect on people across the street as 
well as those across the ocean," Osborne said. "We are seldom used to seeing 
people outside of our cultures." 
</P>
<P>
 Hal and Bettye Walker, founders of the achievers project, explained how they 
keep the center going. De Klerk commented on the strength of the program. "It's 
a privilege for these children to share in such a vast and important program at 
a young age," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was under the leadership of De Klerk's husband -- the last white president 
of South Africa -- that the nation began to dismantle the shackles of 
apartheid, paving the way for the 1990 release from prison of Mandela, head of 
the once-banned African National Congress. The sharing of the Nobel Peace Prize 
by Mandela and F.W. de Klerk in 1993, and Mandela's election as president this 
year, set the stage politically for visits such as the one Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also took a tour of Watson Terrace in Hyde Park, a low-income 
housing complex built with a mixture of public and private funds coordinated by 
Watson. Inside the complex, De Klerk met with residents Leola Singleton and 
Pearl Adams. Both women, glowing with pride over De Klerk's visit, showed the 
curious officials their spotless apartment. Singleton said the trip was 
productive for both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africans "need to know something like this exists, especially for poor 
people," Singleton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Actress and community activist Marla Gibbs was on hand to greet De Klerk and 
Watson at the apartments. She said that South Africa, in search of more ways to 
house its poverty-stricken citizens, can learn lessons in subsidized housing 
from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson said the tour gave the diplomats an opportunity to see a glimpse of 
African American life in Los Angeles from the high points, such as one of 
America's most affluent black communities in View Park, to one of the flash 
points of the 1992 riots, Florence and Normandie avenues.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; JUDGE LEAVES CAMPAIGN DONATION LAW IN 
EFFECT

<P>
 A U.S. District Court judge this week refused to prevent the city from 
enforcing its campaign contribution limit before Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ordinance remains in effect and enforceable -- and the city would enforce 
it if anyone would violate it," said Santa Monica attorney Fredric D. Woocher. 
</P>
<P>
 Woocher was recently hired to assist the city in defending a lawsuit that 
challenges the constitutionality of its campaign reform ordinance, which took 
effect in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit challenges the city's $300 limit on the amount an individual can 
contribute to a committee that uses the money to make independent expenditures 
for or against city candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Righeimer, one of the people who filed the lawsuit, sought an immediate 
restraining order to lift the contribution limit before Tuesday's election. 
Righeimer, who is a Fountain Valley resident, contended that the limit violates 
his right to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's office asked that the case be dismissed, but a judge in 
early October denied that motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Righeimer said he plans to continue his court fight. DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAKE FOREST; DEPUTIES TO CHECK FOR DRUNK DRIVERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County sheriff's deputies will conduct drunk-driving checks at an 
undisclosed location today. 
</P>
<P>
 The checkpoint -- the city's first -- will be on a well-traveled 
street.Drivers will be stopped randomly between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. and asked by 
a team of sheriff's deputies if they have been drinking alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first one since Lake Forest has been incorporated," Sheriff's Lt. 
Robert Nesmith said. "The purpose is to provide a public deterrent to drinking 
and driving." 
</P>
<P>
 The checkpoint is funded by a $500,000 state grant for Sheriff's Department 
operations in South County. 
</P>
<P>
 The funding also allows the city to organize a special anti-drunk driving team 
consisting of two deputies who patrol the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials hope to gauge the effectiveness of a widespread law 
enforcement effort against drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Other communities that will benefit from the grant include Mission Viejo, 
Laguna Niguel, Laguna Hills, San Juan Capistrano, Dana Point and San Clemente.

MULTIMEDIA MISSIONARIES; ROCK 'N' ROLL RELIGION, SAVING EARTH GO HAND IN HAND 
AT HIGH-TECH 'PLANETARY MASS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD C. PADDOCK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Worshipers danced to a pulsating rock beat in the darkened basement of Grace 
Cathedral. Around the room, screens and monitors filled with shifting images: 
planets in motion, planes dropping bombs, plants sprouting from the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 A large globe hung over the circular altar, projecting the face of the 
minister as he declared, "Christ has died. Christ has risen. Christ will come 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the Planetary Mass: part rave, part New Age mysticism, part 
Anglican church service. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Rolling Stones performed across the bay in Oakland, the British 
religious community known as the Nine O'Clock Service brought its high-tech 
program to San Francisco for two evening Masses last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 In the best missionary tradition, they are attempting to attract young people 
to the church by creating a multimedia experience that more resembles a rock 
'n' roll light show than Sunday morning Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thirty-five young people are here generously teaching us to pray in a new way 
-- and an ancient way -- with less books and more dancing," said the Rev. 
Matthew Fox, a defrocked Dominican priest turned Episcopal minister, as he 
delivered a sermon during the Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 The group from Sheffield, England, has not just discarded the pews and changed 
the music. It also is seeking to update the church's message to one more 
relevant to young people today: saving the Earth from environmental destruction 
by abandoning the quest for material goods. 
</P>
<P>
 The members of the Nine O'Clock Service, who take their name from the hour at 
which they hold their evening services, were welcomed to California by the 
Episcopal Church, which invited them to stage the two Masses at the neo-Gothic 
cathedral on Nob Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 William Swing, the Episcopal bishop of California, attended one of the 
services and said he was "carried away by it" -- despite having to sit on the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planetary Mass, with its blend of technology and nature, could prove a 
powerful tool for reaching young people, the bishop said. "I think the Mass 
like we witnessed tonight is a forerunner of what's going to happen," he said. 
"I was very excited by tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Swing also said the young people's movement could help focus debate within the 
church about its responsibility to safeguard all species on Earth, not just 
humans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The church has had a suspicion of nature for a long time," he said. "Not only 
the Christian church but our Jewish ancestors also. You look at 2,000 years (of 
history), we have very few people who champion nature in the church." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he said, the church must focus its attention on the environmental 
destruction of the planet and decide whether it will take a leading role to 
help save the Earth.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're coming to a moment in history where we have to fish or cut bait in 
regard to nature," he said. "Did Jesus die for all people, or did Jesus die for 
all creation, which includes people? This is going to be a critical question 
we're going to have to answer." 
</P>
<P>
 To find young people interested in attending the two Masses, members of the 
Nine O'Clock Service visited churches, environmental groups and the streets of 
the Haight-Ashbury in San Francisco and Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those attending was Grateful Dead leader Jerry Garcia, who was married 
recently in a ceremony conducted by Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 In Britain, the community includes among its members some refugees from the 
drug culture and others who were involved early in the rave scene -- a 
subculture centered around all-night dance parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Pooling their talents in music and art, they began conducting Mass in an empty 
Anglican church and soon were drawing hundreds of people to their nine o'clock 
services. Their innovations were welcomed by the church, which has had 
difficulty attracting young worshipers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We originated out of an incredibly narrow fundamentalist church," said the 
Rev. Chris Brain, the one ordained minister in the British group. "Our place is 
on the chaotic edge of the order. That's where the creativity is." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing is too heavy-handed at the Planetary Mass -- except perhaps the bass 
guitar. The environmentalist message was delivered subtly on television 
monitors as the image of a sleek new car was juxtaposed with pictures of trees 
being cut down. 
</P>
<P>
 As the white-robed minister and his associates talked of equality and 
spirituality, God and the rain forests, images of the moon walk, army tanks and 
people in the streets flashed briefly on the screens. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must change and change quickly or all is lost," Brain told his 
congregation. "We are all saved or we all die." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox, who battled the Roman Catholic Church for a decade before he was silenced 
and then defrocked by the Vatican, said after the service it is essential for 
religion to reach out to young people, who have lost faith in most modern 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The young people have a tremendous stake in this because they are the ones 
inheriting the depleted beauty of the planet," Fox said. "The environmental 
revolution is coming and we don't have much time to do it.

L.A. PRIEST IS NAMED BISHOP FOR UTAH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES RELIGION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pope John Paul II has named a Los Angeles priest known for his work as a 
spiritual director as the new Roman Catholic bishop of Salt Lake City. He is 
the Rev. Msgr. George H. Niederauer, a seminary classmate of Los Angeles 
Cardinal Roger M. Mahony. 
</P>
<P>
 Niederauer, 58, succeeds the Most Rev. William K. Weigand, who was transferred 
to Sacramento last November. Mahony, a longtime friend, will ordain Niederauer 
as the eighth bishop of Salt Lake City on Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Representing a minority faith in an overwhelmingly Mormon state, Bishop-elect 
Niederauer said at a news conference in Salt Lake City that he intends to 
pursue ecumenical programs. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 72,300 Catholics in Utah, about half of whom are Latino, compared to 
1.4 million Mormons, according to figures from the two churches. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahony said Niederauer is "aptly suited," as a scholar and spiritual 
theologian, to build on the dialogue between the Roman Catholic Church and the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
</P>
<P>
 Niederauer said his first priority would be to provide spiritual leadership in 
the diocese of Salt Lake City, which covers the entire state of Utah and has 93 
priests and 160 men and women in religious orders.  
</P>
<P>
 "He knows the value of having priests who take seriously their spiritual lives 
and who live out their priestly commitments through a deep prayer life," Mahony 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Niederauer was ordained to the priesthood in 1962 and since 1993 has served as 
co-director of the House of Prayer for Priests in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Born and reared in Los Angeles, Niederauer graduated from St. Anthony's High 
School in Long Beach, earned a doctorate in English literature from USC and 
joined the faculty of St. John's Seminary College in Camarillo in 1965. From 
1987 until 1992, he was rector of St. John's Seminary.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, on the recommendation of his fellow priests and the archbishop, 
Niederauer was given the honorary title of "chaplain to His Holiness" by John 
Paul. Four years later he was named a "prelate of honor to His Holiness."

MEASURE ON SUICIDE FOUGHT BY CHURCHES; ELECTION: CATHOLIC SOURCES GIVE MOST OF 
THE $1 MILLION THAT FINANCES THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST OREGON PROPOSAL. IT WOULD 
ALLOW DOCTORS TO PRESCRIBE LETHAL DRUGS TO TERMINALLY ILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a rare confluence of opinion, faith groups from Buddhists to Baptists have 
united behind the Roman Catholic Church to fight an assisted suicide measure on 
Oregon's general election ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the measure have portrayed the opposition as Catholics who are 
out of touch with the rest of society. 
</P>
<P>
 The Catholic Church has raised three-quarters of the $1 million being used 
against Measure 16, much of it from collections during Sunday services. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jewish, Muslim and Buddhist leaders, along with 16 other Christian 
denominations, now have come out against the measure as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure 16 would make Oregon the first state to legalize assisted suicide. If 
a doctor believes that a patient has less than six months to live, and a second 
doctor agrees, the patient may ask for a lethal prescription. The request must 
be made twice, then once again in writing, after the doctors have made sure 
every alternative has been rejected. The patient must take the final step of 
ingesting the lethal prescription, which could consist of barbiturates. 
</P>
<P>
 Religious leaders say that decision is one that should not be made by anyone 
but God. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mood of most evangelical Christians that believe the Bible is God's word 
would be concerned with any measure that would prematurely take anyone's life," 
said the Rev. Bill Wilson, senior pastor at Portland Christian Center, an 
Assembly of God church. 
</P>
<P>
 "You die when your time is up," said Fu-gen Schmelzer, a member of the 
Portland Temple of Chinese Buddhists. "There's no running away from the 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Geoff Sugerman, director of the Oregon Right to Die campaign, said it still is 
the Catholics who are raising the money to fight the measure. And he claimed 
that many members of the churches, including Catholics, are divided on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly in terms of our opposition, it's coming from the hierarchy of the 
church. That's why you're seeing archdioceses and bishops around the country 
pumping in hundreds and hundreds of dollars," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are mixed feelings among members of the United Methodist Church, said 
the Rev. Ross Miller. "We have some people for it, some against it," he said. 
"Quite a few people like the idea. It's an area where you take a great deal of 
caution, though." 
</P>
<P>
 The United Church of Christ and United Unitarian Church support the measure, 
saying it is up to the individual to make such decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining the churches that oppose the measure are health organizations, such as 
the American Medical Assn. and the National Hospice Organization. They point to 
the scores of patients who were told they would die within months, then lived 
for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-to-die advocates say the issue boils down to personal choice. "I think 
people of good conscience, of all faiths, agree that individuals with terminal 
illnesses deserve control and choice over their lives," said Barbara Coombs 
Lee, a chief petitioner for Measure 16. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long run, however, what organized religion thinks about the measure may 
have little effect in a state where 17% of the population has no religious 
affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls have indicated widespread support for the initiative, but that was the 
case in Washington and California before voters there narrowly defeated similar 
measures. Those measures also were more strongly worded, allowing physicians to 
administer the fatal drugs.

BELLS FAIL TO GET RINGING ENDORSEMENT FROM ALL; NEIGHBORS: THE CRYSTAL

 The Crystal Cathedral broadcasts hymns of praise to an international audience 
of millions, but a few of its neighbors want less joyful noise and more peace 
on earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, according to former member Max Stauffer, is the bells. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the most gosh-awful noise you ever heard. It's not even music," said 
Stauffer, who has complained to police about the church's $5-million, stainless 
steel carillon, which began ringing in 1991.

batty," said Stauffer, 63. He and his wife, Ann, live two houses west of the 
church's bell tower and have lived in the neighborhood since 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 The evangelical Protestant church was built by the Rev. Robert H. Schuller 
from a drive-in ministry to a Southern California landmark where services are 
broadcast to 20 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stauffers aren't the only neighbors to protest the bells -- the volume as 
well as the selections. 
</P>
<P>
 The carillon has been known to ring out "Three Blind Mice" and "I Dream of 
Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair," said Mark McDaniel, Stauffer's bell-side 
neighbor on Anzio Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's aggressive playing," McDaniel said one recent evening as a baritone 
organ dirge blanketed the neighborhood. "I couldn't even watch TV. It's 
thunder, OK?" 
</P>
<P>
 The bells ring on the quarter hour every day from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., but not 
after 6 p.m. unless there is a special event or concert at the church, said 
spokeswoman Claudia Holloway. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, McDaniel carried around a noise meter, trying to build a case 
against the church. The city changed noise ordinances from one that limited 
decibels to a more subjective standard. 
</P>
<P>
 McDaniel and Stauffer aren't the most popular folks on Anzio Street. Since 
1976, Crystal Cathedral Ministries has acquired 19 homes, about one-third of 
the neighborhood, for employees or church members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bought one of those bells in that tower. My name's on it. That's why I 
moved into this neighborhood," said member Betty Dixon, whose front door opens 
toward the tower. "Where else can you get live organ music?"  
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like living by a train," said Valerie Noot, who lives across the 
street from McDaniel. "But I like the music. It's pretty." 
</P>
<P>
 Church officials said they planned to meet with McDaniel and would do some 
things more quietly, such as leaf-blowing and early morning work on tents and 
risers. But they won't turn down the music. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles J. Todd, chief operating officer of the Crystal Cathedral, said the 
church had made an offer for McDaniel's house. He suggested the flap was 
McDaniel's attempt to get more money.

 Clergy, psychotherapists, social workers and lay people from across the United 
States and Mexico will meet for a conference titled "Research and Treatment in 
Child Abuse and Neglect" at the University of Judaism on Nov. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Child abuse workers are invited to attend the free conference, which runs from 
8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. It is sponsored by the university's psychology 
department and Project SafeCare, a new child abuse prevention program funded by 
the California Wellness Foundation and headed by University of Judaism 
psychology professor John Lutzker. 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers will take up current issues in applied research on the treatment and 
prevention of abuse. Some of the hottest topics, Lutzker said, are teaching 
youths how to engage in nonviolent conflict resolution and teaching the mothers 
of latchkey children to instruct their children in safety and prevention 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cognitive research is red-hot, too," he said. "What attributions a parent 
assigns to a child's behavior may be connected with a risk for abuse. A 
non-abusive parent may conclude a child is acting aggressive or sullen because 
he or she is having a bad day, whereas an abusive parent may decide the child 
is a bad seed or possessed by the devil," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Lutzker received a four-year, $800,000 grant from the California 
Wellness Foundation -- the state's largest private foundation devoted to 
health-related issues -- to study health, safety and bonding among parents at 
high risk for child abuse in the San Fernando Valley. The project's 
co-principal investigator is Ron Doctor, a psychology professor at Cal State 
Northridge, who will also speak at the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're now trying to make treatment more easily disseminated and shorter in 
duration," Lutzker said. "We're trying to see if it can be delivered by nurses, 
caseworkers and even possibly videotapes, rather than using only graduate 
students, who have delivered services very effectively in the past," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking further ahead, the psychologist said he hopes to launch a project that 
will study the relationship between spirituality and family satisfaction in 
Jewish families and how this may affect the incidence of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Other speakers include Hector Ayala of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de 
Mexico , Lizette Peterson of the University of Missouri in Columbia and David 
Wolfe of the Center for Research on Violence Against Women and Children at the 
University of Western Ontario in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 The free conference is open to all interested parties. To reserve a space, 
call Randi Sherman at (310) 476-8647 or fax her at (310) 476-5338.

VALOROUS STRUGGLE, WHATEVER THE ENDING; PRAISE FOR POLICE AND VOLUNTEER EFFORT 
TO FIND MURDERED BOYS IN SOUTH CAROLINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a heartbreaking crime in a small South Carolina town that gripped the 
nation: two little boys, age 3 and 14 months, taken from their mother when she 
was forced from her auto during a carjacking. Everyone imagined how their 
horrified mother must have reached out to them, screaming, as a cruel thief 
with a gun ran off not only with her car but with her babies. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not so. The only part of this sad and tragic story that turned out 
to be true was that Michael and Alexander Smith were indeed victims. It turns 
out they were murdered,and not by the fictitious armed black man Susan Smith so 
conveniently blamed. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say Smith confessed Thursday to the murder of her two sons, 
after law enforcement agencies and good neighbors had spent more than a week 
searching for the boys. They were found inside their mother's car, deep in John 
D. Long Lake near the Smiths' hometown of Union, S.C.  
</P>
<P>
 The case bears a disturbing similarity to a 1989 murder in Boston in which 
Charles Stuart, a store manager, told police that he and his pregnant wife were 
confronted by a robber who then shot his wife to death. 
</P>
<P>
 The killer was described as a black man with a raspy voice and spotty beard 
and wearing a red jogging suit. Police went into full alert, stopping many an 
innocent black man along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out Stuart lied, turning suspicion away from himself by manipulating 
racial fears and giving police the stereotypical description of the urban 
predator. It worked for months, until Stuart's hoax finally began to unravel 
and he killed himself by jumping off a bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 One positive difference between the Boston and South Carolina cases -- 
authorities more quickly began to suspect that something was awry in Smith's 
story; she reportedly had failed lie detector tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and volunteers had worked diligently in honest hope of finding the 
boys. After all, Smith made several tearful appeals on national television, 
begging the pretend kidnaper to spare the boys and bring them home. She fooled 
many people, including those who searched for more than a week in vain. 
</P>
<P>
 The Smith case was so compelling that even President Clinton urged the people 
of Union not to feel betrayed. "I just don't want them to believe that somehow, 
what the mother did in any way diminishes the quality, the character, the 
courage of what they did," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The President is right. The people of Union and law enforcement throughout the 
nation pulled together in hopes of saving two innocent boys. There is glory, 
not shame, in those selfless efforts to help. There is profound shame only in 
the act of murdering two children.

JUDICIAL REFORM PROPOSITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "190 and 191: 'Yes' on Judicial Reform," editorial, Oct. 10: 
</P>
<P>
 Prop. 190 rewrites the way judges are disciplined in California. California 
was the first state to set up a commission to handle complaints against judges 
and since 1960, it has helped us maintain a very high quality judiciary. Now 
the Legislature has a new set of rules it wants you to approve.  
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature designed Prop. 190 so it could control the judiciary by 
dominating the Commission on Judicial Performance. Under Prop. 190, politicians 
would appoint a majority of its members. The Legislature also rewrote the rules 
to give the commission total authority. Under Prop. 190 it would be easy to get 
rid of a judge because he or she bucked a political agenda. Under Prop. 190, 
the commission can suspend a judge without a hearing, with no other court or 
agency checking for fairness. Judges should be independent, and not worried 
about political pressure when they are deciding cases. Judicial discipline may 
need an "update," but it is not necessary to inject politics into the 
discipline process in order to make it work better. 
</P>
<P>
 When Prop. 190 fails, and it should, state Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco) 
will introduce a better bill, based on the new national model just approved by 
the American Bar Assn. It will include the best of Prop. 190, but not the 
dangers. Kopp's bill will open the Commission on Judicial Performance hearings 
to the public and put more lay members on the commission -- but it won't result 
in political control of the judiciary. I urge you to vote no on Prop. 190. 
</P>
<P>
 JUDGE JOSEPH A. WAPNER (Retired) 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court 
</P>
<P>
 * Re your endorsement of Prop. 191, under which the remaining 37 state justice 
courts become municipal courts:  
</P>
<P>
 The Catalina Justice Court is the only justice court in L.A. County. Since the 
state Constitution provides that "each municipal court district shall have no 
fewer than 40,000 residents," Prop. 191 will conceivably cause an involuntary 
merger of the Catalina Judicial District into one of the existing municipal 
court districts of Los Angeles County. This merger with another nearby judicial 
district is what should be at the forefront of voters' minds when they consider 
Prop. 191.  
</P>
<P>
 One consideration involves how the judge of the Catalina Justice Court is 
selected. Although 191 is silent on this issue, a merger with one of the three 
neighboring judicial district would cause the Catalina judge to become the 10th 
judge of the South Bay, the 14th judge of the Long Beach, or the 89th judge of 
the Los Angeles Municipal Judicial District. In other words, rather than voting 
for a single judge, Catalina voters will be combined with the electorate of a 
neighboring judicial district to vote on all judgeships within the combined 
district.  
</P>
<P>
 There are approximately 2,000 persons registered to vote within the Catalina 
Judicial District. No matter into which larger judicial district the Catalina 
Justice Court is consolidated, islander votes will comprise only approximately 
1% or less. Consequently, the choice of the Catalina electorate could be 
overridden by the desires of the "overtown" voters. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, a judicial district merger might include a wider selection 
of judicial candidates, decreased likelihood that a judge would be voted out of 
office based on the judge's political views, and reduced incentive for a judge 
to decide a case based on how popular the decision would be with the local 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other considerations, over and above the name change from "justice" 
to "municipal" court, which voters should take into account before deciding how 
to vote on Prop. 191.

THE PRINCE AND A CINDERELLA SCHOOL; ROYAL VISIT SPOTLIGHTS AN EDUCATIONAL 
TRANSFORMATION OF ALMOST FAIRY-TALE PROPORTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a good thing the Prince of Wales stopped by Foshay Learning Center in 
South-Central Los Angeles this week, media in tow. His visit served nicely to 
turn the spotlight onto the school, meant to be a cutting-edge model for 
high-performance urban schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Just five years ago the scores of students at Foshay, then a middle school 
only, ranked the lowest of any such institution in the Los Angeles Unified 
School District, and it was in danger of takeover by the state. Now Foshay is 
touted as a national example of successful reform.  
</P>
<P>
 The center, along with several other innovations in the L.A. public schools, 
couldn't have happened without the support of the largely unsung heroes who 
make up the Los Angeles Educational Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAEP, a nonprofit organization of good corporate citizens, is working to 
improve the quality of education in Los Angeles schools. In collaboration with 
LEARN (Los Angeles Educational Alliance for Restructuring Now) and committed 
teachers and principals, the partnership taps private-sector money and 
resources and funnels them into bolstering education reform. In a public school 
environment where it's often easier just to follow rules whether they work or 
not, the LAEP helps make experimentation possible. The benefit is obvious: Once 
a school achieves success with a new approach or program, it can be duplicated. 
That's how true educational reform blooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAEP also provides trainers at schools that are looking for new ways, as 
well as proven ways, of teaching and learning. It does fine work. Prince 
Charles marveled at the results at Foshay. News of the school's extraordinary 
transformation won't make screaming tabloid headlines in London, but we think 
it's a pretty big deal just the same.

VOTERS AND CAMPAIGN RHETORIC

<P>
 Re "Voters Call for More Vision, Less Venom," Oct. 24: 
</P>
<P>
 Enough is enough. As a young voter, I do not have the memories of past 
campaigns that were "clean and intelligent." It is scary to think that all I 
know of campaigns is mudslinging and verbal abuse of opposing candidates. How 
did we ever get to this low point? Blame has been quick and sharp in the 
direction of the candidates themselves. This total divesting of blame on 
candidates is unfair. Campaign policies reflect what the voting public wants to 
see. 
</P>
<P>
 It is sad to see that voters respond to predatory campaign tactics. We seem to 
possess an insatiable need for sensationalism and gossip. The victim of this 
predatory tactic is the voter. With real issues being "hidden" under the mud 
and garbage, I find myself asking whether I am voting for the "best" candidate 
or the "best of the worst."

 Before the Tuesday elections, it seems prudent to take a reality check on the 
ballot initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Most proposals stem from inaction by queasy legislators at both state and 
national levels. They were elected to enact laws addressing problems cited in 
the citizen initiatives, but haven't. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all the sound and fury of proponents and opponents of the measures, 
especially where Props. 186, 187 and 188 are concerned, effecting objective 
change is the real challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless election results dictate, the odds for any change are remote, and our 
elected legislators can continue to focus on getting reelected instead of doing 
their jobs.

 Your special section Decision '94 (Oct. 30) was irresponsible reporting. Where

not be "serious candidates."

 Did you ever consider that because The Times does not give third-party 
candidates equal time, the paper is being irresponsible to the electorate? Any 
candidate that goes through the hoops to get on the ballot deserves equal media 
time, regardless of the editor's desire to decide on who is "worthy" of 
consideration for public service. Please, please, please give third-party 
candidates an equal voice.

ASIAN WORKERS AND PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his column supporting Prop. 187 (Sept. 30), Norman Matloff rationalized 
Prop. 187's unjust effects on immigrant communities by arguing that those 
communities actually support it. In particular, he quotes me completely out of 
context to support his thesis that undocumented workers hurt those already 
legally working in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to Matloff's speculations, Asian workers in immigrant communities 
face worsening working conditions not because undocumented workers work 
alongside them, but because unscrupulous businesses in the garment, 
agriculture, food and service industries exploit the vulnerability of 
undocumented workers. These workers often do not demand their most basic labor 
rights for fear of employer retaliation in the form of a call to the INS. 
Employers can thus get away with paying them sub-minimum wages and no overtime, 
and reap huge profits as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 Prop. 187 provides no solution to this problem of super-exploitation, which I 
raised in my original statement and Matloff quoted out of context. Prop. 187 is 
merely a mean-spirited and fearful response to a stagnant economy and 
ineffectual leadership. To stop the downward pressure on wages, labor laws must 
be enforced vigorously against sweatshop employers. Forcing employers to pay 
all workers minimum wage and overtime, regardless of immigration status, 
removes their incentive to hire and exploit the undocumented to the detriment 
of all workers, whether documented or not. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly and Senate tried to address this problem by putting before Gov. 
Pete Wilson three labor law enforcement bills that would have tackled the 
chronic labor law violations in the sweatshop industries. As a favor to his 
friends in big business, Wilson vetoed all three. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Wilson, undocumented workers will continue to be exploited as they 
take the jobs citizen workers reject -- harvesting our crops, taking care of 
our houses and children, busing our dishes and sewing our clothes. Prop. 187 
won't drive them out, it will just deprive them of medical care, basic social 
benefits and schooling of their children.

LAGUNA LAUREL, COAL CANYON WIN PROTECTED STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Fish and Game Commission on Friday unanimously designated Coal 
Canyon in Anaheim an ecological reserve, but defied environmentalists by also 
deciding to allow hunting there. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission, meeting in Monterey, Calif., also extended the ecological 
reserve status to the 76-acre Laguna Laurel in Laguna Canyon, as well as to 
eight other sites throughout the state. No hunting will be allowed in Laguna 
Laurel, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next step is putting a management plan together" for Coal Canyon, said 
Jeff Weir, assistant deputy director for the state Department of Fish and Game. 
"We need to figure out the best use for the land. As part of that, we'll 
determine what level of hunting is appropriate." Weir estimated that hunting 
will be allowed two or three months a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Extending ecological reserve status to the 10 sites, which total about 12,000 
acres, will help protect threatened and endangered plants and animals in 
environmentally sensitive areas, officials said. The designation for Coal 
Canyon means the 952-acre site off the Riverside Freeway will be listed in 
state Fish and Game publications as an approved hunting location. 
</P>
<P>
 Local hunters, backed by Fish and Game staff, say hunting will provide 
recreational opportunities without significantly reducing the wildlife 
population. Though they are happy about Coal Canyon's ecological reserve 
designation, opponents argued that the safety of nature lovers would be 
compromised and rare vegetation would be threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do feel that the commission's decision to allow hunting is capricious and 
arbitrary," said Connie Spenger of Friends of the Tecate Cypress. "Safety is 
definitely a consideration. There's so much brush, the hunters can't really see 
around it that well. In the long run, we really don't think it will pan out as 
a hunting area, but for people interested in nature study, it's a wonderful 
area." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunting has been allowed in Coal Canyon for some time. Only shotguns and bows 
will be allowed for the hunting of game birds such as quail. Fish and Game 
officials do not anticipate droves of hunters going to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Realistically, it's a relatively rugged area that's difficult to access," 
Weir said. "Part of what we're legally supposed to do is provide hunting and 
fishing areas, but our mandate is to make sure it's as good tomorrow as it is 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from lizards, coyotes, hawks and rabbits, the area has a number of rare 
plant species, such as the Tecate cypress tree, which does not grow any farther 
north than Coal Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we can all compromise and work things out for the benefit of 
everybody," said Ron Regehr, 51, a Huntington Beach resident and member of the 
California Sportsmen's Task Force. "I'm looking forward to going out with a 
group to look at the (Tecate) cypress and the plants and tell other people to 
watch out for them." 
</P>
<P>
 In Laguna Beach, where the endangered yellow-green Laguna Beach live-forever 
(Dudleya stolonifera) grows, backers of Laguna Laurel were pleased about the 
designation.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's preserving a very special area not only for the plants, but for the rock 
formations, which are absolutely amazing," said Mary Fegraus, executive 
director of the Laguna Canyon Foundation. "They're like eight-story buildings 
with caves." 
</P>
<P>
 The newly designated areas bring the number of ecological reserves in the 
state to 97. Other areas, with acreage in parentheses, approved Friday for 
ecological reserve status include Estelle Mountain Ecological Reserve (344.35), 
San Rosa Plateau Ecological Reserve (6,900.96) and Sycamore Canyon Ecological 
Reserve (123.10), all in Riverside County; Plaisted Creek Ecological Reserve 
(547.51) in San Diego County, and San Felipe Creek Ecological Reserve in 
Imperial County (1,920).  
</P>
<P>
 Eastern Sierra ecological reserves include Indian Joe Springs Ecological 
Reserve (520) in Inyo County, River Springs Lake Ecological Reserve (637.65) in 
Mono County and Dales Lake Ecological Reserve (366) in Tehama County.

JUDGE MAY LIFT BAN FOR JURORS' LIST OF TV SHOWS; SIMPSON CASE: HOME SHOPPING 
NETWORK LEADS PANEL'S REQUEST, ALONG WITH 'STAR TREK,' 'MELROSE PLACE' AND 
FOOTBALL. STATIONS AGREE TO PROVIDE EDITED MATERIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Judge Lance A. Ito had the "MacNeil/Lehrer News-Hour" in mind, but the jurors 
in the O.J. Simpson case are thinking Home Shopping Network. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular cable TV marketplace topped a list of shows the jurors want to see 
next week, when Ito is expected to relax his order barring them from exposure 
to all television, radio, magazines, newspapers and bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the list was one local news show -- KTLA's "News at 10." One would 
think a nightly news broadcast has as much chance of making the cut as, say, 
Fox's upcoming O.J. Simpson movie. 
</P>
<P>
 But that may not be the case. 
</P>
<P>
 After Ito met Friday with a Simpson prosecutor and a member of the defense 
team, all parties tentatively agreed that jurors could watch edited versions of 
news programs. 
</P>
<P>
 It is likely the panel also will be able to watch tapes of most of the 
television shows they want -- with the commercial breaks edited out -- as well 
as receive newspapers a day late with reports on the Simpson excised. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio would continue to be banned under the tentative agreement because that 
is not considered a hardship, said defense lawyer Shawn Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
 The jurors probably would be allowed to return to bookstores, although it's a 
safe assumption that Ito will admonish them to stay away from the splashy book 
about Simpson's slain ex-wife that shut down jury selection for two days last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 The viewing of edited television programs was made possible after the 
television networks agreed to prepare and produce the tapes.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our office contacted the networks at the request of the judge and they all 
responded favorably," said Suzanne Childs, spokeswoman for Dist. Atty. Gil 
Garcetti. Childs emphasized that the agreement is tentative. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Ito said in open court that he was thinking of letting the 
jury watch public television's "MacNeil/Lehrer" program after Times' television 
critic Howard Rosenberg reported that the show does not do Simpson stories. But 
not a single juror expressed interest in such high-brow fare. Shows jury 
members do want to watch are "Star Trek," "Melrose Place," "Living Single," 
"Martin," "Roseanne," "Home Improvement," "Northern Exposure," "SeaQuest," "The 
Cosby Mysteries," "John Laroquette," "ER," "Sisters," "All My Children," "60 
Minutes" and football. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito and the lawyers met Friday to discuss modifying the order. The list of TV 
shows was compiled after jurors told Ito in writing Thursday what programs they 
miss most.  
</P>
<P>
 Joining Chapman and Ito in Friday's discussion was Deputy Dist. Atty. William 
Hodgman. Chapman emerged from the meeting and said the defense also wanted to 
relieve the jurors of the burden of the media ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito and the lawyers tentatively agreed that the jurors may watch sports on 
regular television, Chapman said, with the exception of ESPN, the all-sports 
cable network, which has offered regular coverage of the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having sports taped and watched later is not the same," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 The modified order will apply only to the 12 jurors and not the more than 80 
people who are scheduled to be in court Tuesday to begin the selection of 15 
alternate jurors, Chapman said. A more restrictive media ban is likely to be 
placed on that pool of potential alternates, she added. The Simpson Jury Here

LOCAL ELECTIONS; PROPOSITION 187; STUDENT RALLY IN OXNARD ENDS AT PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO and IRA E. STOLL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An anti-Proposition 187 walkout involving 150 students from Oxnard High School 
and various other middle schools began chaotically Friday when some 
demonstrators threw apples and ran from police, but ended peacefully with an 
impassioned speech at Oxnard's Plaza Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, about 500 students at Channel Islands High School opted to protest 
the ballot measure after class by marching around the block with 
Polynesian-style dancers, a mariachi band and Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez in a 
rally sponsored by school administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the county at Moorpark High, about 50 students gathered in a classroom 
at lunchtime to devise ways of encouraging adults to vote against 187 while a 
smaller group marched around the cafeteria, shouting their opposition to the 
measure.  
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard walkout started when a group of about 40 students -- some from 
Frank and Fremont middle schools -- marched from Plaza Park to Oxnard High 
School about 10 a.m. and persuaded about 400 Oxnard High students to scale the 
schoolyard fence or exit through an open gate to join their procession. Most 
quickly returned to class, however, and only about 100 joined the march, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The students then proceeded to march several miles through Oxnard to Hueneme 
High, Channel Islands High and Oxnard College, but were mostly unsuccessful in 
their attempts to lure their peers to leave class and join the demonstration. 
After resting and drinking some water at College Park they made their way to 
Plaza Park and dispersed. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have put us down for leaving school," said Janette Cordova, 16, of 
Oxnard High. "But I'm fighting for the right of people to get an education, to 
stay in school. This is the only way people will listen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The march was unruly during its start, as students hurled apples, rocks, and 
in at least one case a bottle at police cars and passersby. Protesters also 
lacked a planned route and ran from police several times, scattering across the 
streets of downtown Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Three juveniles were arrested for throwing rocks at police during the protest, 
said Oxnard Police Sgt. Frank Porter. Two of the teen-agers were taken to 
Juvenile Hall on suspicion of assault, and the third was taken to the Oxnard 
Police Station and later released. 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of the protest, a police motorcycle and a squad car collided 
while trying to keep the students in order near C Street, said Officer Don 
Mulville. No one was injured and neither vehicle was seriously damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 As the march gained momentum, the protesters calmed down -- or wore down -- 
and by the end of the demonstration were marching in a neat file under the 
leadership of a handful of Oxnard College students who joined midway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just trying to prove that we're united," said Oxnard College student 
Demetrio Silva, 34. "We're not being violent. We live under a society of 
oppression and we've been saying 'Yes, sir,' and 'Yes, ma'am' for too long." 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to earlier threats of looting, however, police around noon 
established a cordon of at least two dozen officers in riot gear around the 
Amar Ranch Food Warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some students said they'd rush the store and ransack it," said Cmdr. Jamie 
Skeeters. "We asked the manager to shut the store down for a few minutes till 
they disperse."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After more than three hours of marching, the tired students sat down to rest 
in Plaza Park, but police told them to disperse and go home or return to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Before obeying the orders, however, the group, which had dwindled to about 75, 
remained still while Silva told them to stand up for their rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're playing with us, they're manipulating us," Silva exhorted the crowd. 
"First they want us, then they don't." 
</P>
<P>
 He told the students that Proposition 187 was the latest episode in a long 
history of exploitation against Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're targeting our people," Silva said. " . . . They founded their land on 
rape and pillaging." 
</P>
<P>
 After the march, the students quietly left the park and returned to school or 
went home. The police presence was light compared to a much larger protest last 
week in Oxnard, where about 1,500 students gathered at the park for an 
anti-Proposition 187 rally. 
</P>
<P>
 But some students warned that if the proposition passes Tuesday, there will be 
trouble in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be a war," said Ilma Becerra, 15, of Oxnard High. 
"Mexicans and whites are not going to get along."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the demonstration at Channel Islands High at times strayed from 
the anti-Proposition 187 theme into a broader celebration of cultural 
differences. Held at the school's football stadium at the end of the school 
day, the rally was planned by student leaders and school officials seeking to 
avoid student walkouts.  
</P>
<P>
 Students insisted on marching, however -- so they marched around the block. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way, students chanted "No on 187," but they were drowned out by 
mariachi music and overshadowed by the Polynesian-style dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, participating students at the school said the event had been an 
educational experience for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out it wasn't just (targeting) Mexicans but all illegal immigrants," 
said Blane Saipaia, a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the students who attended were Latino, student organizers 
said they tried hard to make the event multicultural to attract different 
student groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We publicized it in every class," said Dung Hoang, president of the school's 
student government. "This is a humanity issue. If you're an immigrant, this is 
about you."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, about 40 students at Chaparral Middle School threatened to walk off 
campus Friday morning to protest Proposition 187, but were talked out of it by 
school administrators and instead spent their lunch hour making placards for an 
after-school walkout. The students then marched peacefully to Moorpark City 
Hall at the end of the school day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get people not to vote for Prop. 187 because it's going to 
cause problems," said Ramiro Gonzales, 13. "People are going to be out in the 
streets."  
</P>
<P>
 And at Moorpark High School, a small group of students marched around the 
campus shouting anti-187 slogans at lunchtime while about 50 of their peers met 
in a classroom and discussed ways of persuading those who can vote to oppose 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 One student who was eating lunch was punched in the mouth by a protester, 
school officials said, but the small march was otherwise peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Cary Dritz said there was a potential for greater violence during 
the brief demonstration. "It created a situation where kids were taking sides," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The student was not seriously injured, and the protester who hit him escaped 
into the crowd, Dritz said.

LOCAL ELECTIONS; 35TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT; FIRESTONE, LORENZ USE VITRIOL IN 
MAILERS, ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Continuing a bitter battle of campaign mailers, state Assembly candidate 
Brooks Firestone on Friday characterized his Democratic opponent as a two-faced 
political extremist, while Mindy Lorenz accused Firestone of being involved in 
voter fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The race to represent the 35th Assembly District, which includes western 
Ventura County, has turned even more vitriolic in recent days with both 
candidates trading blows in campaign mailers and on television and radio. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury entered the fray by denouncing as 
false and misleading the Lorenz mailer that mentioned Firestone's involvement 
in a voter fraud case. 
</P>
<P>
 The case involves two women arrested after submitting dead people's names as 
newly registered Republican voters. Although Firestone's campaign turned in the 
forms to county election officials, the candidate has maintained that neither 
he nor his campaign staff knew the registration cards were fakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone said there is no way his campaign could have gained by registering 
dead people to vote, and that independent subcontractors submitted the names 
for $3 each. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got taken," he said. "And we've done everything we can to help the 
district attorney clear this up." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lorenz said she is not convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know his organization employed the two workers, and we know his campaign 
workers submitted the campaign documents," she said. "I think it's important 
for voters to know what Brooks is involved in before the election." 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenz's Halloween-themed new flyer depicts a cat walking along a graveyard 
fence and states in capital letters: "Everyone has skeletons in their closet . 
. . only Brooks wants his to vote." 
</P>
<P>
 The mailer also states: "Firestone's campaign authorized paying two workers 
for submitting names they had taken off of tombstones from our local cemeteries 
. . . Firestone's campaign then tried to pass them off as legitimate voters." 
</P>
<P>
 In his statement denouncing the mailer, Bradbury said that the Firestone 
organization's only involvement in the case was to assist in the identification 
and apprehension of the individuals involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Firestone and his organization are as much victims of the fraud that 
allegedly occurred here as the general public," Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenz said she believed her campaign mailer was not misleading, and added 
that Bradbury has a potential conflict of interest because he has endorsed 
Firestone for the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel the information in the mailer is correct," she said. "It seems as if 
Mr. Bradbury has come to conclusions about Brooks Firestone, while the matter 
is still under investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone, who said Lorenz's mailer "took the life out of me," immediately 
began airing radio commercials Friday saying that Lorenz "had so misrepresented 
the truth that the district attorney had to step in to protect voters." 
</P>
<P>
 "We would rather be talking about issues, but we're forced to do this because 
of misrepresentation by my opponent," Firestone says in the ad. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lorenz said that it is Firestone who started the mudslinging. Early in the 
race Firestone sent out mailers with a picture of a color-changing lizard, 
which was intended to draw attention to Lorenz's history of switching political 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone sent out a second mailer accusing Lorenz of wanting to legalize 
drugs like cocaine and heroin. And this week, he sent out the third mailer, 
titled "The Many Faces of Mindy Lorenz," which accused her of being a political 
extremist who supports everything from legalizing drugs to illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Firestone set the tone of the campaign with the attacks and lies 
early on," Lorenz said. "What I'm trying to do is set the record straight."

THREAT OF DEVELOPMENT ON ORCHARD RENEWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 A year after winning election on an environmental platform, Ventura Councilman 
Steve Bennett is proposing a ballot measure that would circumvent a 
save-the-greenbelt initiative by exempting city land that has been at the 
center of a tug of war between developers and preservationists. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat of development on the 87-acre lemon orchard at Telegraph Road and 
Petit Avenue was the reason nearby homeowners proposed the greenbelt initiative 
last spring. The measure would forbid development of any land designated 
agricultural until 2010, unless the project was put to a citywide vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchard carries such agricultural zoning, but it can be developed if the 
council amends its Comprehensive Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The greenbelt initiative -- called Save Our Agricultural Resources -- is 
planned for the November, 1995, ballot. The council will discuss Monday whether 
to follow that initiative with the measure proposed by Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
 That one would exempt the orchard from the new law as long as its development 
was somehow linked to construction of a regional park -- a major goal of the 
council. The council wants to use the orchard as its trump card in cutting a 
deal for an eastside park, trading the orchard and permission to develop homes 
on it for a park site.  
</P>
<P>
 "This means the SOAR initiative won't slow us down at all," Bennett said. "We 
can keep moving right on forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett, who helped pass out petitions for the greenbelt initiative this 
summer, said his proposal is not an attempt to subvert the voter-sponsored 
measure to preserve eastside farmland. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a question to the voters: Is an east-end regional park a good enough 
reason to change (the orchard's) zoning?" he said. "We need to know that. If we 
don't get to ask that question in November, 1995, we may not get to ask it for 
another two years" when Ventura holds its next city election. 
</P>
<P>
 But some supporters of the greenbelt initiative immediately cried foul. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm extremely disappointed in Steve Bennett," said Sheri Vincent, one of the 
initiative's organizers. "It's the ultimate slap in the face, that's what it 
really is. (The orchard) is only one piece of property, but it's the catalyst 
that started this whole initiative." 
</P>
<P>
 If both the greenbelt and the city initiatives pass by simple majority next 
November, the council would not have to ask the voters' approval before 
permitting construction on the orchard. 
</P>
<P>
 Many on the council oppose the greenbelt initiative, saying it is a cumbersome 
and unwise method of charting city development.  
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Jim Monahan said he thinks Bennett's proposal sends the wrong 
signal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how we can take city property and treat it any differently than 
privately owned property," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of what to do with the lemon orchard became a hot topic this year 
when developer Ron Hertel offered to swap his 94 acres at Telephone and Kimball 
roads for the city's orchard. He offered to give Ventura $2 million toward 
building a regional park on his land in exchange for permission to build about 
400 homes on the city's property. 
</P>
<P>
 When residents who lived adjacent to the lemon orchard heard about the 
proposal, they rallied in opposition and soon began collecting signatures for 
the greenbelt initiative.

LOCAL ELECTIONS; PROPOSITION 187; STUDENTS IN MOORPARK STAGE CAMPUS PROTESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO and IRA E. STOLL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Small groups of students from Moorpark High School and Chaparral Middle School 
rallied Friday against Proposition 187 while in Oxnard more than 150 students 
from Oxnard High School and various middle schools walked out of class to 
protest the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 At Moorpark High, about 50 students gathered in a classroom at lunchtime to 
devise ways of encouraging adults to vote against 187 while a smaller group 
marched around the cafeteria, shouting their opposition to the measure.  
</P>
<P>
 In Oxnard, youths participated in the impromptu walkout, which began 
chaotically when some students threw apples and ran from police, but ended 
peacefully with an impassioned speech at Oxnard's Plaza Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard walkout started when a group of about 40 students -- some from 
Frank and Fremont middle schools -- marched from Plaza Park to Oxnard High 
School about 10 a.m. and persuaded about 400 Oxnard High students to scale the 
schoolyard fence or exit through an open gate to join their procession. Most 
quickly returned to class, however, and only about 100 joined the march, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The students then proceeded to march several miles through Oxnard to Hueneme 
High, Channel Islands High and Oxnard College, but were mostly unsuccessful in 
their attempts to lure their peers to leave class and join the demonstration. 
After resting and drinking some water at College Park they made their way to 
Plaza Park and dispersed. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have put us down for leaving school," said Janette Cordova, 16, of 
Oxnard High. "But I'm fighting for the right of people to get an education, to 
stay in school. This is the only way people will listen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The march was unruly during its start, as students hurled apples, rocks, and 
in at least one case a bottle at police cars and passersby. Protesters also 
lacked a planned route and ran from police several times, scattering across the 
streets of downtown Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Three juveniles were arrested for throwing rocks at police during the protest, 
said Oxnard Police Sgt. Frank Porter. Two of the teen-agers were taken to 
Juvenile Hall on suspicion of assault, and the third was taken to the Oxnard 
Police Station and later released. 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of Thursday's protest, a police motorcycle and a squad car 
collided while trying to keep the students in order near C Street, said Officer 
Don Mulville. No one was injured and neither vehicle was seriously damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 As the march gained momentum, the protesters calmed down -- or wore down -- 
and by the end of the demonstration were marching in a neat file under the 
leadership of a handful of Oxnard College students who joined midway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just trying to prove that we're united," said Oxnard College student 
Demetrio Silva, 34. "We're not being violent. We live under a society of 
oppression and we've been saying 'Yes, sir,' and 'Yes, ma'am' for too long." 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to earlier threats of looting, however, police around noon 
established a cordon of at least two dozen officers in riot gear around the 
Amar Ranch Food Warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some students said they'd rush the store and ransack it," said Cmdr. Jamie 
Skeeters. "We asked the manager to shut the store down for a few minutes till 
they disperse."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After more than three hours of marching, the tired students sat down to rest 
in Plaza Park, but police told them to disperse and go home or return to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Before obeying the orders, however, the group, which had dwindled to about 75, 
remained still while Silva told them to stand up for their rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're playing with us, they're manipulating us," Silva exhorted the crowd. 
"First they want us, then they don't." 
</P>
<P>
 He told the students that Proposition 187 was the latest episode in a long 
history of exploitation against Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're targeting our people," Silva said. " . . . They founded their land on 
rape and pillaging." 
</P>
<P>
 After the march, the students quietly left the park and returned to school or 
went home. The police presence was light compared to a much larger protest last 
week in Oxnard, where about 1,500 students gathered at the park for an 
anti-Proposition 187 rally. 
</P>
<P>
 But some students warned that if the proposition passes Tuesday, there will be 
trouble in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be a war," said Ilma Becerra, 15, of Oxnard High. 
"Mexicans and whites are not going to get along."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the demonstration at Channel Islands High at times strayed from 
the anti-Proposition 187 theme into a broader celebration of cultural 
differences. Held at the school's football stadium at the end of the school 
day, the rally was planned by student leaders and school officials seeking to 
avoid student walkouts.  
</P>
<P>
 Students insisted on marching, however -- so they marched around the block. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way, students chanted "No on 187," but they were drowned out by 
mariachi music and overshadowed by the Polynesian-style dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, participating students at the school said the event had been an 
educational experience for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out it wasn't just (targeting) Mexicans but all illegal immigrants," 
said Blane Saipaia, a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the students who attended were Latino, student organizers 
said they tried hard to make the event multicultural to attract different 
student groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We publicized it in every class," said Dung Hoang, president of the school's 
student government. "This is a humanity issue. If you're an immigrant, this is 
about you."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, about 40 students at Chaparral Middle School threatened to walk off 
campus Friday morning to protest Proposition 187, but were talked out of it by 
school administrators and instead spent their lunch hour making placards for an 
after-school walkout. The students then marched peacefully to Moorpark City 
Hall at the end of the school day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get people not to vote for Prop. 187 because it's going to 
cause problems," said Ramiro Gonzales, 13. "People are going to be out in the 
streets."  
</P>
<P>
 And at Moorpark High School, a small group of students marched around the 
campus shouting anti-187 slogans at lunchtime while about 50 of their peers met 
in a classroom and discussed ways of persuading those who can vote to oppose 
the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 One student who was eating lunch was punched in the mouth by a protester, 
school officials said, but the small march was otherwise peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Cary Dritz said there was a potential for greater violence during 
the brief demonstration. "It created a situation where kids were taking sides," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The student was not seriously injured, and the protester who hit him escaped 
into the crowd, Dritz said.

INTREPID ATHLETES; SPORTS: TWO AMPUTEES WILL RACE TOGETHER AS A RELAY TEAM IN 
TODAY'S CATALINA TRIATHLON COVERING 22 KILOMETERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the months of preparation leading up to the Catalina triathlon today, Danny 
Robinson of Ventura knew his performance could only improve. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year I came in dead last" in the swim, ride and run race, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But," he joked, "I swept the amputee division." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Robinson was the only amputee in the race. This year, though, he will 
have company -- 24-year-old Rene Verduzco of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the majority of amputees -- older people with diabetes -- both Verduzco 
and Robinson lost their legs in accidents when they were young and physically 
capable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really easy to feel sorry for yourself," said Robinson, 45. "I went 
through that, too. But you have to get on with your life." 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the first race for Verduzco, a technician at Channel Islands 
Prosthetics-Orthotics. The Oxnard native has remained active during the nine 
years since a train accident caused him to lose his right leg below the knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get a lot of exercise -- football, basketball, that sort of thing -- but I 
just started running seven weeks ago," Verduzco said. "A couple of times a 
week, me and a friend start at the mission and run up the hill to the (Father 
Serra) cross and back." 
</P>
<P>
 Verduzco will ride the bicycle as part of the two-man relay team. The bicycle 
portion is 16 kilometers of up-and-down riding over Catalina's steep roads.  
</P>
<P>
 Since the third member of the relay team dropped out at the last minute, 
Robinson will do both the five-kilometer run and the one-kilometer swim. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many on the island know him from when he used to live there, Robinson 
expects that more than a few spectators will be surprised to see an amputee 
coming out of the water. But he will respond to any astonished looks, he said, 
with his standard comment: "Look out for the sharks." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said the idea of a relay team came from John McAtee, co-owner of 
Channel Islands Prosthetics-Orthotics, who sponsored Robinson last year and 
will sponsor both men this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although McAtee said that few amputees are as active as Robinson and Verduzco, 
there are more out there than is apparent. Most cover their prostheses with 
clothing and avoid situations that would expose their condition, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson went to the other extreme. He put a flag on his leg.  
</P>
<P>
 "I could have put a foam cover on Danny's to make it look more like a leg, but 
he didn't want that," McAtee said. "He wanted the California flag laminated 
right onto" the prosthetic leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said the prosthesis isn't something he wanted to hide. On the 
contrary, the Ventura College psychology student thinks the 1978 motorcycle 
accident that cost him his left leg was a small price to pay for a new life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Losing this leg was the best thing that happened to me," he said. "Before I 
lost it, I was a heavy drinker and generally out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 The transition to his new, sober life began shortly after his leg was 
amputated. A fellow amputee showed him an article on Terry Fox, a cancer victim 
who made a much-publicized run across two-thirds of Canada in 1980 before 
succumbing to the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said to myself: I'm gonna do that. I'm not going to let this thing get me 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then he tried several artificial legs before McAtee urged him to try a 
new carbon fiber model called Flex-Foot, an $8,000 device made by a company in 
Laguna Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's been in the last 10 years that space-age materials like carbon fiber 
have made running -- competitive running -- possible," McAtee said. "All the 
current records were made on the Flex-Foot." 
</P>
<P>
 The current amputee record holder in the 100-meter dash is less than 2 seconds 
off the world record time of 9.8 seconds -- for everyone, able-bodied and 
disabled alike. Robinson, however, expects to finish more than a few seconds 
off the course record today. 
</P>
<P>
 When most of the contestants are finished and enjoying a post-race beer, 
Robinson will still be chugging through the run. Nevertheless, he will be 
enjoying the encouragement of a faithful crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know all my old friends will be there cheering me on," he said.

LOCAL ELECTIONS; CONEJO PARK DISTRICT; CHALLENGERS PRAISE INCUMBENTS IN RACE 
FOR 3 BOARD SEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The toughest challenge for the five candidates running for the Conejo 
Recreation and Park District board of directors is gaining notice in a 
community that already registers almost complete satisfaction with its park 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more than with the sheriff's and fire departments, people in Thousand 
Oaks are happy with their park system -- 89.5% of respondents in the 1994 
Conejo Valley attitude survey saying they are very or moderately satisfied with 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
 That level of satisfaction has left the candidates barely a shred of 
controversy to campaign on, and that, they say, is just fine with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board has done a very good job and I want to see that maintained," said 
businesswoman Susan Holt, 52, who is campaigning for her first term. 
</P>
<P>
 Three park district seats are on Tuesday's election ballot.  
</P>
<P>
 Park board directors meet twice a month and are paid $100 per meeting. They 
oversee a system of 31 developed parks in Agoura, Thousand Oaks and Westlake. 
The district also shares administration with Thousand Oaks of 11,000 acres of 
open space. 
</P>
<P>
 Two incumbents, Dennis Gillette and Mike Berger, are running for new four-year 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The power of incumbency on the Conejo park board is strong enough that Berger 
and Gillette were unchallenged until Director Mike Wooden announced he would 
not seek reelection because he is leaving the area. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, three challengers joined the race: Holt; Jeff Alexander, 49, 
the owner of a pet and livestock supply store in Thousand Oaks, and Ronald 
Ruef, 39, a salesman for Morton Salt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Both Dennis and Mike have done a great job, so I don't feel like I'm running 
against them," Holt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Berger, 47, principal at a Moorpark middle school, has been on the park board 
for 10 years. He was first appointed to fill a vacant position in 1984 and has 
been reelected twice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a high level of satisfaction with the job that the district 
is doing," Berger said. "I didn't mean that to sound holier than thou, but we 
have a great staff and that makes our jobs much easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Gillette, 55, has been on the board for seven years, since being appointed to 
fill an unexpired term and twice winning reelection. He is vice president for 
administrative services at Cal Lutheran University. 
</P>
<P>
 "We seldom have controversial issues," Gillette said. "The board seldom turns 
over, and as a result, there is a great deal of cooperation and mutual respect 
that exists among board members." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both Berger and Gillette said the biggest problem they face as directors 
concerns budget constraints. As a special district funded by property taxes, 
the park district has seen its $9-million operating budget drained by a state 
shift in funding to school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been through two years of difficult times," Gillette said. "What I'm 
trying to do is everything I can to maintain the current level of services we 
have, come out the other side of this budget crisis and start improving 
services." 
</P>
<P>
 Berger said building new parks on existing district land has been hampered by 
$900,000 in state cuts in the past two years. Additionally, 75% of the 
district's $391,000 annual construction budget is used to meet access 
requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act, he said. He said he would 
step up cooperative efforts with area businesses and volunteers to improve 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the budget cuts, the Conejo district has won two major awards in the 
last month: It was named top park district in the state by the California Assn. 
of Recreation and Park Districts and one of four finalists for the National 
Gold Medal Award by the National Recreation and Park Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruef, who served as an appointed commissioner on the Long Beach Parks and 
Recreation Commission for five years before moving to Newbury Park last year, 
said he wants to take an aggressive approach to upgrading parks and replacing 
outdated equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He said he would support an effort to build a new sports facility in the 
Conejo Valley. Softball and soccer fields are too crowded, he said, 
particularly with players in adult leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Long Beach we raised money for a sports complex by the evil word -- a bond 
," Ruef said. "I know how to do these things. I've got ways. I've done it." 
</P>
<P>
 Holt, who has been executive director of the summer Oakleaf Music Festival for 
eight years, said she would bring diverse interests and ideas to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am interested in the arts, but I've also been involved with youth sports," 
said the 14-year resident of Thousand Oaks. "What I'm campaigning on is the 
fact that I do have a balance of interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Holt, who was a member of the first class at Harvard Business School to admit 
women 25 years ago, owns a temporary employee service in Thousand Oaks. She was 
recently elected to the board of Under One Roof, a nonprofit collective of 
social service agencies in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander, who has lived in Thousand Oaks for 22 years, is chairman of the 
Conejo Open Space Trails Advisory Committee. An avid horseman who has been 
involved with the group Equestrian Trails Inc., he said he supports use of 
trails by horses, bikes and hikers. 
</P>
<P>
 Expanding current services is the district's biggest need, he said. And he 
suggests seeking help from corporations and volunteers to help the park through 
its budget crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every individual group has particular needs," he said. "These needs have been 
identified. But for lack of money, they have not been able to proceed.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; FIVE-ACRE PARK OPENS TO CHEERS OF KIDS, 
ADULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Eight-year-old Johnny Hansen had just one thing to say about the new 
playground outside his Lincoln Elementary School in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it very much!" he yelled, scampering past a flower bed after a 
dedication ceremony Friday afternoon. And then, clearly not satisfied that he 
had expressed himself fully, he burst out: "Very much! Very much! Very much!" 
</P>
<P>
 The enthusiasm -- if not the sheer vocal power -- quickly spread to Johnny's 
classmates, who crowded onto the freshly paved basketball court to watch the 
park's dedication ceremony during their lunch recess. 
</P>
<P>
 After checking out the jogging track and exercise equipment, 10-year-old Lukas 
Josker said he planned to spend sunny afternoons in the park working out 
secretly, in an effort to impress his father. "He makes me do pushups at 
basketball practice," Lukas said, explaining his motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-acre park off 1st Street aims to blend an adult workout center with 
an elementary school playground. 
</P>
<P>
 Planted with saplings and a sprinkle of purple flowers, the park includes a 
jogging path, a jungle gym and exercise equipment for chin-ups and sit-ups. 
And, for the more sedentary, picnic tables and benches. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurning the sun-splashed seats, Louie Cardenas jogged steadily around the 
meandering path Friday afternoon, working up a sweat as he completed six 
circuits. "I used to run on 1st Street and down Royal Avenue," he said, "but 
there were too many lights and too many stops. This is great." 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, added Cardenas, "We just got a puppy and I'm sure he'll love it." 
</P>
<P>
 Built at a cost of $350,000, the park features eight trees donated by 
elementary school students, who held an aluminum can drive last year to raise 
money for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't this just wonderful?" Lincoln Principal Aileen Buhring asked her 
beaming students, who responded with a hearty cheer. "We're going to enjoy this 
park a whole lot." 
</P>
<P>
 On dedication day, however, the Lincoln students didn't get to enjoy much 
besides the crisp fall air. They shuffled back to school immediately after the 
half-hour dedication ceremony, casting longing glances at the slides and swings 
and monkey bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Too young to attend school, 2-year-old Forrest Dunes toddled around the 
playground, gleefully tossing fistfuls of sand at his mother, Karmyn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live across the street, and we've been watching (the construction) the 
whole time," Karmyn Dunes said. "He's been real excited about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Forrest, however, had his own opinion. With the stubborn insistence of a 
2-year-old, he looked around the colorful playground and said simply, "No!"

 Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury has endorsed Republican Steve 
MacElvaine, a candidate in the 18th state Senate District. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury, in a prepared statement, praised MacElvaine for his support of law 
enforcement when he served as a San Luis Obispo County supervisor from 1979 to 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "His leadership and experience will add a local voice for Ventura, Santa 
Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties," Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 MacElvaine, a cattle rancher and mobile home park owner, said he was honored 
to receive the endorsement of "one of the toughest prosecutors in the state of 
California. He doesn't make snap judgments." 
</P>
<P>
 MacElvaine is competing against Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) for 
an open seat in the 18th District, which includes Ventura, Ojai and Santa Paula 
and all of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. CARLOS V. LOZANO

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: DISPUTE OVER SIGNING OF AUDITS SETTLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An official with the state Board of Accountancy said Thursday that Ventura 
County Auditor-Controller Thomas O. Mahon is authorized to sign county audits, 
settling an earlier dispute between Mahon and the regulatory agency. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigator with the Board of Accountancy notified Mahon in June that he 
was not authorized to sign county audits because he was not a certified public 
accountant. 
</P>
<P>
 But since then Mahon has contacted the board and the attorney general's office 
to get a clarification of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, Dick Poladian, president of the Board of Accountancy, said after 
reviewing Mahon's case a second time the board determined that he is legally 
authorized to sign audits. 
</P>
<P>
 Poladian said business code sections governing the practice of public 
accountancy are intended to apply only to those accountants who provide direct 
services to the public for compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 He said a county auditor, on the other hand, is an elected official who does 
not serve the public directly but rather carries out specific duties mandated 
by statute and the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon, who was appointed auditor-controller in January, 1993, after serving 21 
years as assistant auditor, is running for election to the $124,000-a-year 
post. His opponent is accountant Richard Morrisset. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of Mahon's ability to sign audits was raised by another campaign 
rival in the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mahon passed the CPA exam, he did not complete the field work 
necessary to receive his certification. But Mahon said his experience in the 
auditor's office more than qualifies him for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon said he is relieved the issue has been cleared up. "It was only because 
of the election," Mahon said. "It was just somebody trying to make some 
problems." CARLOS V. LOZANO

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an early step toward creating about 38 miles of hiking and cycling trails, 
Ventura County supervisors have agreed to make an interest-free loan to help 
transportation officials move forward on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The county and the cities of Ventura, Santa Paula and Fillmore want to buy 
37.8 miles of right of way from Southern Pacific Transportation Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The longest stretch, 32 miles of track from Montalvo to Piru, could be used as 
a bike trail and for Fillmore's dinner trains. 
</P>
<P>
 The other 5.8-mile stretch, to be called the Ventura River Trail for hikers 
and cyclists, would connect the beachfront Omer Rains Trail to the Ojai Valley 
Trail. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors on Tuesday approved the $50,000 loan to the Ventura County 
Transportation Commission to help cover initial costs such as appraisal and 
legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura, Santa Paula and Fillmore have agreed to front the costs for the 
commission which expects to be reimbursed by the federal government within 
three months. KENNETH R. WEISS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: HELICOPTER PILOT SAFE AFTER WATER LANDING

<TEXT>
<P>
 A pilot whose helicopter developed engine problems off Anacapa Island escaped 
injury when he inflated the aircraft's pontoons and made an emergency water 
landing Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remarkably enough he landed and didn't get hurt at all," Coast Guard Petty 
Officer James Dubea said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aspen Helicopter owner Charles McLaughlin said pilot James McCrory was doing 
contract work for the U.S. Navy, patrolling the waters off the Channel Islands 
during routine missile testing, when the trouble developed. 
</P>
<P>
 McCrory told Coast Guard officials that he felt a kick in the helicopter's 
tail, then saw every light and alarm on the control panel go off. He inflated 
the pontoons, landed, shut the engines off, radioed for help and waited. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very weird just seeing this helicopter sitting in the ocean with this 
guy sitting in the pilot seat," Dubea said. "He wasn't hurt at all. He was just 
laughing and joking about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard, National Park Service and the California Department of Fish 
and Game all responded to the accident, which took place about four miles from 
the east end of Anacapa Island. MARY F. POLS

<P>
 An official in the secretary of state's office said Thursday that Ventura 
County supervisorial candidate Scott Montgomery had filed the necessary papers 
with the state to run for supervisor, clearing up questions raised earlier by 
local authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Don Coleman, Ventura County special assistant district attorney, 
said it appeared that the Moorpark city councilman had failed to notify the 
secretary of state about using his council campaign committee to run for 
supervisor.Candidates are required to form campaign committees in order to 
establish a bank account to accept campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman said he found no record that Montgomery had contacted state officials. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nelwin Jackson, an official in the secretary of state's office, said 
Friday that Montgomery had complied with the law. She said he had filed the 
necessary paperwork with the Moorpark city clerk in March, but that the clerk 
never forwarded the information. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said her office received a faxed copy of Montgomery's campaign papers 
on Wednesday. CARLOS V. LOZANO

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; CHARGE AGAINST WOMAN REDUCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MURPHY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosecutors dropped an attempted murder charge against a Newbury Park woman 
Friday because the alleged victim -- her husband -- has recanted part of his 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia Burns, 44, accused of ramming a jacked-up car when Jimmy Burns was 
working beneath it, now is charged with assault with a deadly weapon and felony 
hit and run in the Sept. 23 incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Connors said the attempted murder charge was reduced 
because his office no longer believes it can prove the defendant intended to 
kill Jimmy Burns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some evidentiary problems concerning the victim (because) the victim 
has recanted on a lot of his statements," Connors said. "The specific intent to 
kill was not as strong as we thought." 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant's lack of prior violence also played a part in the decision, the 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Burns, 41, testified at a preliminary hearing last month that his wife 
could not have seen him under the jacked-up car when she rammed it with her 
vehicle. He also testified that Marcia Burns' car had a mechanical problem that 
occasionally caused it to surge forward. 
</P>
<P>
 A witness told police he heard the defendant call out, "I hope you die" to her 
husband four times, including once after she rammed the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Another witness said he told Marcia Burns she had hurt her husband, and she 
said, "Good," and drove away, Connors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Burns told police he saw the wheels of the car approaching before he was 
hit, and he heard his wife's voice, Connors said. However, at the hearing Jimmy 
Burns testified that he neither saw nor heard anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia Burns, who is free on $50,000 bail, is scheduled for trial on Dec. 5.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BUENA PARK; VOLUNTEERS MAKE ROOM FOR STEWART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stewart Porte was like any other teen-ager when he wished for a room of his 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 But that simple wish turned out to be the most complicated ever attempted by 
the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Orange County, which was nonetheless determined 
to grant the desire of the 13-year-old leukemia patient. 
</P>
<P>
 So, on Jan. 10, ground was broken behind the Portes' small house on Mexico 
Way, about six months after the day Stewart noticed the unexplained bruises 
that signaled his cancer. And Wednesday night a few of the scores of people who 
contributed time, effort and money to grant Stewart's wish gathered in his new 
bedroom-bathroom suite to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was with a sigh of relief that we actually accomplished this," said Jerry 
Bame, executive vice president of Make-A-Wish, who was on the three-person team 
that tackled Stewart's wish. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff and Angela Smetanka, the other team members, earned the gold wishbones 
given to volunteers who fulfill a wish, 1 1/2 years after they started. Most 
wishes -- trips to Disneyland, a visit with a celebrity -- take just two or 
three months to accomplish, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bame and the Smetankas first persuaded the city to waive all building fees. 
Then they lined up more than 40 builders, electricians, cabinetmakers and other 
contractors willing to donate labor and materials to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, whose cancer is now in remission, now has a room decorated in a 
baseball motif, with a desk, mini-refrigerator and ceiling fan. 
</P>
<P>
 As grateful as Stewart was, Dominick, his 15-year-old brother with whom he 
shared a room, was at least as happy. "At least now I can keep my room clean," 
said Dominick, a neat freak who slept in the living room while Stewart 
underwent chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't thank you enough for all you've done," Bame said to Stewart's 
benefactors at the Wednesday unveiling. "But we hope the smile on Stewart's 
face is thanks enough." LESLEY WRIGHT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; SOLUTION SOUGHT IN COFFEE-STAND DISPUTE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura College administrators plan to meet with an employee union to work out 
a disagreement over a gourmet coffee stand in the college cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 College district trustees on Tuesday told senior managers to try to resolve a 
dispute with staff members over a contract that leases out space for the coffee 
stand and employs students instead of college workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Service Employees International Union Local 535 complained to 
trustees that contracting out for services that could be provided by union 
members is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 They threatened the district with a lawsuit if an agreement is not reached. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll meet with administrators, but we're going to be firm in our position," 
union official Gregory P. Cross said. "In the meantime, our attorneys are 
looking at the alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
 The newly opened Grounds for Coffee stand at Ventura College violates state 
law because the students, who are paid less, work for an outside 
concessionaire, union officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one's lost a job over it," Cross said. "But the concern is that if we 
don't say, 'You can't do that,' how can we say it's not OK later?" 
</P>
<P>
 Vice Chancellor Jeffrey Marsee, who signed the lease allowing the stand to 
operate inside the college cafeteria, said there is no difference between the 
coffee stand and other contractors that have been brought in elsewhere in the 
district. JEFF McDONALD

AL MARTINEZ: NEVER TOUCH A PRINCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a city that has survived earthquakes, fires, floods, riots, elections and 
celebrity trials, the visit of a prince was small potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not saying that his royal highness, the Prince of Wales, is personally a 
small potato, only that the visit itself did not register seismically. 
</P>
<P>
 To the contrary, he has become a very big potato lately in the tawdry world of 
royal scandal, considering his public admission of sexual scampishness with 
Camilla Parker-Bowles. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think anyone would have minded had he just kept quiet about his 
romantic misbehavior, since a regal roll in the hay has never brought down a 
kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 But doing it is one thing, and pounding one's chest in public triumph is quite 
another. A man should never expect applause after sex, no matter how well it 
seems to have been accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 Good taste, however, has never been a condition of royal achievement, so 
ultimately Bonnie Prince Charlie will be forgiven, though he seems somehow less 
bonnie than he was. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of that, there is a curiosity factor that surrounds the visit of a 
prince, so when he stopped by Crenshaw High the other day, I stopped by too. 
</P>
<P>
 My invitation was issued by the law firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, a company 
that does free work for Food From the 'Hood, a student enterprise created to 
raise money for college scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 I was as intrigued by lawyers doing something for nothing as I was by the 
royal visit itself, though their publicist's description of the heir to the 
British throne as "the Prince of Whales" was compelling. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The people at Crenshaw were as nervous as mice in a cathouse before the 
arrival of Chuck, as we say in Los Angeles. Seak Chan was no exception. She is 
a student owner of Food From the 'Hood and was one of those assigned to greet 
the prince at the gate. 
</P>
<P>
 A 17-year-old junior, she described the day as the most exciting time in her 
life. "It would be something to have the mayor visit," she said, "but that 
would be no big deal. I've met the mayor. I've never met the prince." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the British Embassy, ever on the alert for possible Yankee 
crudities, advised the students on how to behave in the presence of the Prince 
of Whales, I mean Wales. Chan says the students were told not to touch him. It 
wasn't a question of getting warts or anything like that, she explained, it was 
just protocol. She shrugged. "I hadn't planned on touching him anyhow." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were also not to drag him along with us," she added in the serious way of 
the young working on their manners. "You know, like taking his arm and leading 
him or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the most stringent of regulations was that of not asking the 
prince any questions, a condition that seemed to prevail throughout his visit. 
Especially questions about you-know-who and you-know-what. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan's job, before Charlie's arrival, was to escort the media to an area 
isolated by the kind of yellow tape that keeps spectators away from a murder 
scene and keeps bodies in. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no rules for her to follow on showing reporters and photographers 
to the area. Shove 'em along, kick 'em along, roll 'em along, whatever it takes 
to get 'em there. Touch 'em all you want. They love it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prince Charles arrived on schedule, wearing the kind of vague smile that has 
come to characterize British royalty, as though they are wondering slightly 
just where they are and why. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan did her job as well as she could, but about halfway down a path leading 
to an area where the prince was to dine, the still photographers and television 
camera carriers swooped in like swallows returning to Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you could say, "Off with their heads!" the Prince was surrounded by 
about 30 of them. They moved in a solid cluster all the way to the luncheon 
area. One photographer, walking backward, fell and disappeared under their 
feet, never to be seen again. 
</P>
<P>
 To the best of my knowledge, however, not one of them actually touched the 
prince or attempted to drag him along or ask him a question. It is a new 
generation of journalists. In the old days, one of them surely would have 
shouted, "Hey, Prince, you still sleeping with Camilla?" 
</P>
<P>
 But I am not here to darken the memory of Charles' otherwise pleasant visit, 
however lackluster it might have seemed to those of us accustomed to more 
raucous occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 A balding, middle-aged man rode into town on a rather lame horse, smiled 
blandly, waved and was gone, and that was that. How nice. Who's next?

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; NURSE PLEADS GUILTY TO SEXUAL MOLESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former nurse at St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard pleaded guilty 
Friday to sexually molesting two male patients in the hospital's emergency 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Superior Court Judge Bruce A. Clark promised to place Gordon Butikofer, 
37, on probation in exchange for his guilty plea to two counts of felony sexual 
battery on an institutionalized person.Butikofer had faced a maximum possible 
sentence of five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Three men, all using a Spanish interpreter, testified at a preliminary hearing 
last month that they were fondled at the hospital. Two of the witnesses 
identified Butikofer as the man who molested them, but the third said he was 
unable to open his eyes because of blood flowing from a head wound. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Calvert would not comment on the plea agreement, 
saying only that if any prior felony convictions are discovered between now and 
Butikofer's sentencing, the promise of probation is voided. 
</P>
<P>
 Butikofer worked as a registered nurse at St. John's from January, 1993, to 
May of this year. Now a Utah resident, he is free on $10,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 He is scheduled to be sentenced Jan. 13. BARBARA MURPHY

<TEXT>
<P>
 You'll still occasionally catch Orange County old-timers referring to the 
southwestern part of Santa Ana as Delhi (pronounced "del-high"). 
</P>
<P>
 The area was given the unusual name in the 1870s by the McFadden brothers, two 
well-known Orange County pioneers.The brothers migrated to the area from Delhi, 
N.Y., and decided to name the property they were developing after their old 
hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 A small farming community, complete with a post office and a school, prospered 
there. Eventually, the area was annexed by Santa Ana. Most of the farmland is 
gone now, replaced by tract homes and apartments. In the 1960s, the county 
changed the name of Delhi Road to Warner Avenue. Today 
</P>
<P>
 A Victorian fair will be held at the Discovery Museum of Orange County from 10 
a.m. to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair will include historical displays as well as period plays, music, 
dancing, crafts and storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
 A Victorian-style tea, antique cars, American Indian music, a children's 
workshop, games and a shopping area are also featured. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum is at 3101 Harvard St. in Santa Ana. Admission is $6, and $4 for 
Discovery museum members. For more information, call (714) 540-0404.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; CITY GIVES OK FOR AUTO STORAGE YARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite residents' objections, the Port Hueneme City Council has granted a 
permit allowing a temporary automobile import storage yard on a 10-acre site 
near a residential area on Hueneme Road. 
</P>
<P>
 After seven residents spoke against the project during a public hearing this 
week, the council voted unanimously to allow the facility to operate for three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am truly disappointed with the council's decision," said Katy Greenstreet, 
a resident near the site between J Street and Ann Avenue. "They just don't 
listen to the will of the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors have argued that the yard, which will be used to store vehicles that 
enter the country through the Port of Hueneme, would increase traffic and noise 
and diminish the character of their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials said the facility will not increase traffic, because the 
cars already pass the site on their way to storage in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Yard owner Michael Poston said he will build a turning lane off Hueneme Road 
that will prevent traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
 If the facility brings serious problems to the area, council members said they 
have the power to withdraw the permit. CHRISTINA LIMA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MOTHER PLEADS GUILTY IN CHILD ABUSE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MURPHY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oxnard woman who dropped her infant daughter over a six-foot-high fence 
pleaded guilty Friday to a felony charge of child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Aretha Marcell Chester, 23, was promised probation by Superior Court Judge Joe 
D. Hadden when he sentences her Dec. 7.She remains free on her own recognizance 
until then, Deputy Dist. Atty. Maeve Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chester dropped her 3-month-old daughter after arguing with a group of men at 
Sierra Linda Park in Oxnard. When the men jumped over a chain-link fence, 
Chester dangled the infant over the fence and dropped her, according to court 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby suffered a fractured skull but has since fully recovered, Fox said. 
The child now lives with her paternal grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Jorge Alvarado said Chester believed someone was going to 
catch the baby when she let go. 
</P>
<P>
 "She recognizes that by holding the child over the fence she exercised poor 
judgment . . . and that the child fell and was hurt," Alvarado said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense will seek a sentence that includes no jail time, but possibly 
community service and training in parenting skills, Alvarado said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox said she has mixed feelings about the court's commitment to place Chester 
on probation, though she is doubtful the defendant would have been sent to 
prison in any event. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's very young and the baby is fine," the prosecutor said. "I also think 
(Chester) has real psychological problems. If we can address that while she's 
on probation, then it's not so bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarado said the guilty plea probably will not prevent Chester from someday 
regaining custody of her daughter. That issue will be handled by a different 
judge, he said. BARBARA MURPHY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; MALL OWNERS TO SKIP EXPANSION SESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owners of the Buenaventura Mall say they will not attend Wednesday's 
scheduled public work session on the mall's expansion plans, prompting Ventura 
officials to wonder whether the company plans to back out of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the participation of MaceRich Co., council members say they will 
probably cancel the workshop.They say, however, they are beginning to question 
the firm's resolve to proceed with any mall expansion plans, a project that 
some council members say is key to the city's economic revitalization efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "(MaceRich's) message has suddenly shifted big time as to how interested they 
might be," Councilman Gary Tuttle said. "The way they've been responding to our 
questions, it's almost like they want a way out."  
</P>
<P>
 MaceRich officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, MaceRich proposed doubling the mall's size, adding three department 
stores to the two already on the site, and constructing a second level. The 
28-year-old mall would be renovated and two multilevel parking structures would 
be built. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura officials say the company has talked recently of scaling those 
plans back due to financial constraints. The revised design was to have been 
presented at the Wednesday workshop. CONSTANCE SOMMER

<TEXT>
<P>
 One candidate has raised nearly $50,000 to win one of four seats on the City 
Council in Tuesday's election. Others plan on raising nothing or spending as 
little as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to past council races when candidates raised upward of $80,000, 
campaign fund raising and spending is down this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the 22 candidates have refused to accept financial contributions. A 
few are amassing political war chests of hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Many candidates will kick in their own money and nearly a dozen expect to 
spend $10,000 to $35,000 or more -- in the hope of being among the lucky four. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph H. Bauer has the biggest campaign war chest of more than $47,000 in his 
attempt to keep his seat. He was appointed to the council two years ago to 
complete the term of Jack Kelly who died in office. 
</P>
<P>
 David P. Garofalo plans to spend about $38,000 while a number of others expect 
to raise and spend more than $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley S. Dettloff will spend about $29,000; Peter M. Green, about $23,000; 
Richard Henderson, about $35,000; Paul Horgan, about $19,000; Edward H. Kerins, 
about $15,000; and Susie Newman, about $28,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Those planning to spend $10,000 or less include: George E. Arnold, about 
$2,500; Thom Doney, about $3,000; Mary Mays-McCaughey, about $8,000; Roy H. 
Richardson, about $7,000; Steven A. Sherman, about $5,700; Daris L. Steen Sr., 
about $10,000, John A. Thomas, about $10,000 and Maureen R. Werft, about 
$4,400. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates who plan to spend $1,000 or less include Steve Matus, Jonothon M. 
Cone, Jim W. Thomas, Vida Louise Martin and Dan A. Traxler. Emil (Jinx) Varona 
has refused to accept contributions.DEBRA CANO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; CITY COUNCIL OPPOSES SMOKING 
INITIATIVE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Joining forces with other cities in the county, the Port Hueneme City Council 
unanimously agreed to oppose Proposition 188, which would permit smoking in 
some public places where it is now prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ken Hess said he opposed the proposition because it robs local 
governments of the ability to pass their own laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposition "is trying to usurp the authority of local governments," Hess 
said. "They are telling us how to make rules in our own cities, and that is not 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 Although smoking is not allowed in city-owned buildings in Port Hueneme, 
restaurants are allowed to have smoking areas. 
</P>
<P>
 If Proposition 188 is passed on the November ballot, it would nullify local 
laws on smoking and tobacco, and, among other things, allow smoking in office 
lounges. CHRISTINA LIMA

200 PAY RESPECTS TO LA HABRA OFFICER KILLED IN COLLISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 200 people gathered Friday night to pay their respects to Michael 
Anthony Osornio, the young La Habra police officer killed by a suspected 
drunken driver this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've cried more this week than I have in five years because of this," Rex 
Spraggins, a chaplain with the La Habra Police Department, told those assembled 
at Rose Hills Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such an overwhelming loss, but we can choose whether to hate or to love. 
If this makes us hate, everything will be for nothing. I think Mike would want 
his family to be closer than they've ever been before, to love more than 
they've ever loved before." 
</P>
<P>
 Flanked by an honor guard of two uniformed La Habra police officers, Osornio's 
uniformed body lay in an open casket along with the purple-ribboned hazardous 
duty medal the department had awarded him posthumously. Behind him in the 
casket sat a picture of his favorite pet -- a boxer pup -- and a photograph 
taken two months ago on a Cancun vacation showing the smiling 26-year-old 
officer in shorts, sandals and a broad hat, with his fiancee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big loss," said Anthony Campillo, a close friend. "I have an empty 
feeling inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Jason Schouw, another friend: "Life is precious. This reinforces that it 
can go at any point." 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra Police Chief Steven H. Staveley tried to put the tragedy in 
perspective: "It's not dissimilar to losing a child. Michael had real star 
quality as a police officer and there are so few of those. He was going to be 
great, and this is just so stupid and wasteful." 
</P>
<P>
 Osornio's police car was hit Monday night at Beach and La Habra boulevards by 
a driver who ran a red light at about 60 m.p.h., police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marco Villegas Ramirez, 51, of La Mirada, who remains at Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana, has been booked on suspicion of gross vehicular manslaughter.

COALITION OF SIMI VALLEY CHURCHES HELPS THE HOMELESS SURVIVE; COMMUNITY: PUBLIC 
ACTION TO DELIVER SHELTER OFFERS THE NEEDY A PLACE TO SLEEP, FOOD, SHOWERS AND 
OTHER SERVICES SO THEY CAN START ESCAPE FROM POVERTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Chuck Tice knows how it feels to be down and out. Eight years ago, the Simi 
Valley communications engineer was unemployed and out of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of friends, he found a job and slowly got back on his feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started to realize how tenuous your lifestyle becomes when you go from a 
decent income to zero," he said. "The words it can happen to anybody took on a 
new meaning for me, and I really wanted to help other people who got stuck in 
the same spot." 
</P>
<P>
 For five years, Tice has been helping provide meals and a place to sleep for 
needy people through PADS -- Public Action to Deliver Shelter -- a coalition of 
churches that provides shelter and assistance to the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 From November to March, PADS offers up to 50 homeless people a warm, safe 
place to sleep each night. A meal program provides hot dinners year-round for 
as many as 200 people a night. And the newly opened Samaritan Center at St. 
Francis of Assisi Episcopal Church on Royal Avenue provides showers, clothing 
and mail service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really want to act as a cushion for people, so they don't fall into 
despair," Tice said. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent chilly evening, Kurt Hartman and his two children were among 40 
people who gathered at Grace Brethren Church for spaghetti, hot dogs, green 
beans and chocolate ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartman, 38, said he is struggling to raise his youngsters on the wages he 
earns as a gardener. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a single parent it's tough to make ends meet," Hartman said as he gathered 
up several loaves of bread to take home to his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 At a folding table nearby, Hartman's 9-year-old daughter, Jessica Faith 
Hartman, sorted through a heap of free clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people are nice and you can find good clothes," she said, explaining that 
the bulky pale yellow coat she wears indoors and out is one of the treasures 
gleaned from the clothing pile. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her father agreed. "At that age, kids grow so fast it's hard to keep up with 
the clothes," he said. "As they grow, we bring in the old clothes and get new 
ones." 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the evening, a handful of the diners headed across town to Church of 
Christ, where they bedded down in cheerful, Sunday school classrooms for the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 PADS worker Geoffrey Kasule is charged with ensuring that all of the guests, 
as the overnight visitors are called, understand the house rules: no drinking, 
drugs, fighting or parking lot parties. Breaking these rules subjects violators 
to a two-week suspension from the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "To do this job, you have to be both soft and firm," Kasule said. "Soft in a 
compassionate way, but firm in setting the rules, or people will walk all over 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 While PADS operators would ultimately like to open a full-time permanent 
shelter, the rotating churches approach has worked well, said Ken Constable, an 
accountant who manages the program's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 PADS operates on about $10,000 a year in donations and grants, he said. Of 
that, Tice is paid $600 a month for his 40 to 60 hours of work, while Kasule 
receives $350. The rest is spent on sleeping bags, food, medical services and 
other operating expenses, Constable said. Most of the program's food is donated 
by the churches. 
</P>
<P>
 This winter, PADS is seeking donations to help pay for 150 extra-thick 
sleeping rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the classic case of a shoestring operation," he said. "We are fueled 
mainly by volunteer support." 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of volunteers from two dozen Simi Valley churches prepare meals and 
staff the shelters overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice a month Ruby Meadows volunteers at Grace Brethren, serving up dinner and 
a smile to hungry visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once in awhile you get somebody who is gruff and ungrateful," Meadows said. 
"But most people seem genuinely thankful that we're here." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Church of Christ, in preparation for the arrival of guests one recent 
night, volunteer Mary Johnson brewed coffee and unwrapped vegetables, dip and a 
plate of fudge brownies she had baked that morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary and her husband, Bill Johnson, would spend the night at the church, 
sacking out on sofas and ensuring the night passed without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The guests began to trickle in, gathering in the fluorescent-lit community 
room for post-dinner conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Palos, 29, is a frequent guest of the PADS program. Last winter she 
moved into a government-subsidized apartment, Palos said, but was evicted 
because she had too many cars parked on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really like to buy old cars and then resell them to make money," she said. 
Now all of her belongings are locked in a storage unit and her children are 
living with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 On this night Palos said she had just been released from a five-day jail stint 
for running a red light, driving without a license and failing to appear in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just need a little time to get back on my feet," Palos said as she nibbled 
a baby carrot. "One thing I learned is that if you are homeless once, you will 
be homeless again." 
</P>
<P>
 Slumped on a nearby sofa, Rod Gillespie, 47, said he was ready to make a 
change in his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got an interview tomorrow for a construction job," Gillespie said. 
"Eight dollars an hour. Not too shabby. I've been down before, and I'm ready to 
turn things around." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 To volunteer, make a donation or learn more about the PADS homeless shelter 
program, call Chuck Tice at 527-4445.

PAC SAYS IT DID NOT AID 2 WHO APPEARED ON MAILER

<P>
 The leader of a conservative political group helping to finance Orange County 
school board campaigns said Friday that two Tustin Unified candidates 
originally listed as receiving contributions from the organization actually 
just bought space in a slate mailer from the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Bucher, the Tustin resident who heads the Education Alliance, said his 
group paid $350 each for candidates Jonathan W. Abelove and Jane Bauer to be 
included in an independent conservative slate mailer.Abelove and Bauer fully 
reimbursed the Education Alliance within days. The Alliance paid the 
slate-mailer fees for other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not our candidates," Bucher said of Bauer and Abelove, who are 
running as a team. "But we prefer them over some other candidates." 
</P>
<P>
 The Education Alliance, a political action committee that grew out of last 
year's failed voucher campaign, raised more than $36,000 last month and is 
supporting about 30 candidates in 15 local school board races, according to 
campaign finance statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Abelove and Bauer's reimbursement was not listed on Education Alliance's 
recent campaign finance statement because it came after the filing period's 
deadline for contributions, Bucher said.

SANTA ANA POLICE, FIREFIGHTERS PACS FLOUTS CAMPAIGN REFORM, CRITICS SAY; 
POLITICS: 'INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES' FOR CANDIDATES THEY HAVE ENDORSED ARE 
LEGAL. FOES SAY THE UNIONS ARE SKIRTING THE $1,000 CAMPAIGN LIMIT.

 The city's police and fire associations are spending tens of thousands of 
dollars on behalf of the candidates they endorse, a shift in political strategy 
that critics say skirts the intention of new campaign contribution caps. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of making campaign contributions, the political action committees that 
represent police officers and firefighters are spending money for the 
candidates, printing and sending political mailers and buying lumber for 
candidates' yard signs, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and fire officials said they make "independent expenditures" without 
the cooperation of candidates -- in compliance with state law. Letting the 
public know which candidates they endorse is a valuable public service, they 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had hundreds of people ask us: 'Tell us how to vote. Tell us who is pro 
law enforcement,' " said Don Blankenship, president of the Police Officers 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics say the tactic takes advantage of a legal loophole and flouts the 
intent of the city election reform law that went into effect last year, capping 
contributions at $1,000.  
</P>
<P>
 The law is an attempt to keep politicians from being influenced by campaign 
contributors, and requires that elected officials abstain for one year from 
voting on matters that could benefit any contributor who gives $250 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 By making independent expenditures, however, the unions continue to spend 
thousands on candidates who later vote on police and fire labor contracts if 
they win. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many of us who have tried to raise the flag and said, 'Don't you 
see what has happened here? We have inadvertently given the police and fire 
associations the keys to the city,' " said mayoral candidate John M. Raya, who 
is not endorsed by the groups. "It's a pretty clear way of circumventing the 
intent of the campaign reform process, and it's too bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana's unions are not alone in deploying the tactic. Election reform 
watchdogs said independent expenditures have increased statewide in response to 
contribution caps.  
</P>
<P>
 "Contribution limits are important, but they don't solve the whole problem. 
When you step on a bubble in one place, a bubble pops up someplace else," said 
Ruth Holton, executive director of the Sacramento-based California Common 
Cause. "People obviously find ways that they can continue to influence the 
political process. I think it's a real problem."  
</P>
<P>
 Independent expenditures are legal as long as they are made without the 
candidates' "cooperation, coordination, assistance or advice," said Jeanette 
Turvill, a spokeswoman with the state Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 That means they cannot pose for mailer photos or contribute information about 
their records for the use in mailers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and fire unions have both endorsed known leaders in the 17-candidate 
field, supporting councilman and mayoral candidate Miguel A. Pulido Jr., and 
incumbent council members Robert L. Richardson and Patricia A. McGuigan. They 
have also endorsed council candidate Alberta Christy in a race with no 
incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Oct. 26, the political arm of the Firemen's Benevolent Assn. reported 
spending $34,492 -- more than $20,000 of it on printing, postage and signs for 
the four candidates. The association's consultant, Debra Fritz, said Friday 
that she planned to report an additional $10,000 worth of mailer expenses that 
the group has since made. 
</P>
<P>
 Fritz said the firefighters association has always spent money on mailers, 
even when the union was able to contribute unlimited sums to candidates. The 
spending increased significantly this year, she said, because the union sent 
out additional mailers after two unendorsed candidates' distributed mailers 
featuring pictures of firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Friday, the police officers' political action committee reported 
spending more than $85,800, at least $33,500 on the four city candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time this year, the group's PAC has hired a political consulting 
firm, Ashland Wooldridge and Pierson of Santa Ana, to mount a campaign on 
behalf of the endorsed candidates, Blankenship said. With the independent 
expenditures, police have become more involved in this year's campaign, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like a lot of people, we thought (the contribution caps) were going to hinder 
groups like us who want to get the pro-police people in office," Blankenship 
said of the reform law. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we took a second look at it, we realized that actually you can do more 
for your candidates this way. The cops now become more involved with the 
candidate and the campaign, to a certain extent. I think in actuality it may 
have pushed our stock up." 
</P>
<P>
 However, some residents criticize the unions' involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the way it's being done, they're stretching the interpretation of an 
independent expenditure," said John Acosta, a former city councilman who helped 
draft the election reform law. "The way the police and fire have gone about it, 
I just think it's a way to beat the system." 
</P>
<P>
 Fritz turned away the criticism that the unions are buying favors. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can the council do for us? Give us raises? Look at the contract 
firefighters signed off on this year," she said. "Zero salary increase. Zero. 
Zip. Zilch." Political Spending The amounts of money spent by the political 
arms of the Santa Ana Police Officers and the Santa Ana Firemen's Benevolent 
associations have increased over past election years. Rather than provide 
candidates with direct cash contributions, this year the unions are 
independently spending money on behalf of the candidates. The dollar figures 
reflect total political activity expenditures for the year listed, not just 
money spent on city races. *

ELECTIONS / CONEJO PARK DISTRICT; CHALLENGERS FOR 3 BOARD SEATS HOPE TO MIRROR 
INCUMBENTS' SUCCESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The toughest challenge for the five candidates running for the Conejo 
Recreation and Park District board of directors is gaining notice in a 
community that already registers almost complete satisfaction with its park 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more than with the sheriff's and fire departments, people in Thousand 
Oaks are happy with their park system -- 89.5% of respondents in the 1994 
Conejo Valley attitude survey saying they are very or moderately satisfied with 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
 That level of satisfaction has left the candidates barely a shred of 
controversy to campaign on, and that, they say, is just fine with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board has done a very good job and I want to see that maintained," said 
businesswoman Susan Holt, 52, who is campaigning for her first term. 
</P>
<P>
 Three park district seats are on Tuesday's election ballot.  
</P>
<P>
 Park board directors meet twice a month and are paid $100 per meeting. They 
oversee a system of 31 developed parks in Agoura, Thousand Oaks and Westlake. 
The district also shares administration with Thousand Oaks of 11,000 acres of 
open space. 
</P>
<P>
 Two incumbents, Dennis Gillette and Mike Berger, are running for new four-year 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The power of incumbency on the Conejo park board is strong enough that Berger 
and Gillette were unchallenged until Director Mike Wooden announced he would 
not seek reelection because he is leaving the area. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, three challengers joined the race: Holt; Jeff Alexander, 49, 
the owner of a pet and livestock supply store in Thousand Oaks, and Ronald 
Ruef, 39, a salesman for Morton Salt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Both Dennis and Mike have done a great job, so I don't feel like I'm running 
against them," Holt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Berger, 47, principal at a Moorpark middle school, has been on the park board 
for 10 years. He was first appointed to fill a vacant position in 1984 and has 
been reelected twice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a high level of satisfaction with the job that the district 
is doing," Berger said. "I didn't mean that to sound holier than thou, but we 
have a great staff and that makes our jobs much easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Gillette, 55, has been on the board for seven years, since being appointed to 
fill an unexpired term and twice winning reelection. He is vice president for 
administrative services at Cal Lutheran University. 
</P>
<P>
 "We seldom have controversial issues," Gillette said. "The board seldom turns 
over, and as a result, there is a great deal of cooperation and mutual respect 
that exists among board members." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both Berger and Gillette said the biggest problem they face as directors 
concerns budget constraints. As a special district funded by property taxes, 
the park district has seen its $9-million operating budget drained by a state 
shift in funding to school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been through two years of difficult times," Gillette said. "What I'm 
trying to do is everything I can to maintain the current level of services we 
have, come out the other side of this budget crisis and start improving 
services." 
</P>
<P>
 Berger said building new parks on existing district land has been hampered by 
$900,000 in state cuts in the past two years. Additionally, 75% of the 
district's $391,000 annual construction budget is used to meet access 
requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act, he said. He said he would 
step up cooperative efforts with area businesses and volunteers to improve 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the budget cuts, the Conejo district has won two major awards in the 
last month: It was named top park district in the state by the California Assn. 
of Recreation and Park Districts and one of four finalists for the National 
Gold Medal Award by the National Recreation and Park Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruef, who served as an appointed commissioner on the Long Beach Parks and 
Recreation Commission for five years before moving to Newbury Park last year, 
said he wants to take an aggressive approach to upgrading parks and replacing 
outdated equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He said he would support an effort to build a new sports facility in the 
Conejo Valley. Softball and soccer fields are too crowded, he said, 
particularly with players in adult leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Long Beach we raised money for a sports complex by the evil word -- a bond 
," Ruef said. "I know how to do these things. I've got ways. I've done it." 
</P>
<P>
 Holt, who has been executive director of the summer Oakleaf Music Festival for 
eight years, said she would bring diverse interests and ideas to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am interested in the arts, but I've also been involved with youth sports," 
said the 14-year resident of Thousand Oaks. "What I'm campaigning on is the 
fact that I do have a balance of interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Holt, who was a member of the first class at Harvard Business School to admit 
women 25 years ago, owns a temporary employee service in Thousand Oaks. She was 
recently elected to the board of Under One Roof, a nonprofit collective of 
social service agencies in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander, who has lived in Thousand Oaks for 22 years, is chairman of the 
Conejo Open Space Trails Advisory Committee. An avid horseman who has been 
involved with the group Equestrian Trails Inc., he said he supports use of 
trails by horses, bikes and hikers. 
</P>
<P>
 Expanding current services is the district's biggest need, he said. And he 
suggests seeking help from corporations and volunteers to help the park through 
its budget crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every individual group has particular needs," he said. "These needs have been 
identified. But for lack of money, they have not been able to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community is growing, and we need to ensure that the parks department 
services those people," he said. "I believe the parks provide the breathing 
space for citizens."

CITY IS URGED TO SEEK NEW SOURCES OF REVENUE; THOUSAND OAKS: REPORT SAYS MONEY 
FROM DEVELOPERS WILL DRY UP AND THAT INCOME FROM OTHER AVENUES WILL NEED TO BE 
TAPPED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After years of surviving on the largess of development, Thousand Oaks should 
outline new ways to generate money if it hopes to maintain a high quality of 
life, according to a report presented to the city this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, forwarded to city planners, outlines goals and guidelines for 
expanding the business community and luring private investment to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want Thousand Oaks to become a megalopolis," said Mervyn Kopp, a 
planning commissioner and the report's author. "I just think we've got to sit 
down and think about these issues before it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp said the city's General Plan -- which provides a blueprint for long-term 
growth -- does nothing to address economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has relied on a combination of sales tax and developer fees paid with 
each new construction project to fund an array of city improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 But when builders have filled all of the city's available land, which is 
expected in about 10 years, the money from developers will dry up and the city 
will need new sources of income, Kopp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks leaders from all sides of the long-fought debate over growth 
agree they need to prepare for a future without development. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years, boom has been the word in Thousand Oaks," Councilwoman Jaime 
Zukowski said. "Development made this community, and it will be a real 
challenge to not have that cash pouring in." 
</P>
<P>
 Zukowski said an economic plan for the future must emphasize maintaining 
Thousand Oaks' assets, including protected open space, uncluttered ridgelines, 
low crime and good schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it comes time to compete with other cities, maintaining the unique 
quality of life here is the one thing that will set us apart," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp agreed, but said those factors alone would not ensure the city's economic 
stability. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks, he said, will be competing with neighboring cities to lure 
enough businesses and jobs to maintain high sales tax revenues. Simi Valley and 
Camarillo, among others, are launching their own efforts to attract the same 
types of businesses. In fact, Camarillo is negotiating with Blue Cross to move 
its offices from the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in a very competitive environment, and if the other cities all around 
us have a plan to lure businesses and jobs, we're going to lose out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders disagree on the methods the city should use to stay competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Lazar, who has long pushed for an economic component to the General Plan, 
said she did not want to see the city using financial incentives to lure 
out-of-town business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Already we have the amenities which make us a city attractive to business," 
Lazar said. "We need to do more to make it simple for businesses to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 That includes streamlining the permitting process, and relieving some of the 
impositions placed on businesses wishing to remodel, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, such as Zukowski and Planning Commissioner Marilyn Carpenter, also 
stressed the importance of being selective when inviting businesses into the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Some businesses may initially appear attractive but might, in the long term, 
drain more from city coffers than they will contribute in tax dollars, 
Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
 That concern, as well as others, will be debated by the city's General Plan 
Review Committee, and then by the Planning Commission and City Council, 
Carpenter said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Commissioner Kopp's proposal is at the beginning of a long process," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Lazar said, adding an economic section to the General Plan is in 
the city's best interest. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, she said, Thousand Oaks has not needed to consider these economic 
issues. But the city's financial future is less certain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are at a time where there is a lot of change," she said. "We've never 
really addressed these issues in writing, and I think it would be wise for us 
to do so now."

BARCLAY ESTATE OWES THEATER, SUIT CLAIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The UC Irvine Foundation, the city of Irvine and the Irvine Barclay Theatre 
filed suit Friday against Marjorie A. Barclay and the estate of her husband, 
charging the family has failed to pay $600,000 of the $1 million pledged to the 
theater that bears their name. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the Barclays announced the pledge to help complete construction of 
the 750-seat theater, set on a 2.3-acre site on the UCI campus.At that time, 
grateful theater officials announced that the $17.6-million facility would be 
named for Richard Barclay, a Newport Beach real estate developer. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater company is supported by the university and the city. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the lawsuit, the Barclays made two payments of $200,000 toward 
their pledge, to the UCI Foundation, in June, 1990, and June, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Barclay died in June, 1992, and since then, the suit alleges, no 
further payments have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the Barclay estate and family members could not be reached for 
comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI spokeswoman Karen Newell Young said the foundation has made repeated 
attempts to negotiate payment of the $600,000 without success. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to legal documents, there is sufficient money in the estate to 
honor the pledge," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Failure to honor the pledge, she said, "is not fair to other donors who didn't 
have an opportunity to have something named after them."

GROUP URGES DOCTORS TO GIVE SPIRITUAL ADVICE; HEALTH: THE CHRISTIAN MEDICAL & 
DENTAL SOCIETY WANTS MEMBERS TO OFFER MORE THAN JUST PHYSICAL HEALING. A 
BIOETHICIST SAYS SUCH PRACTICES NEED TO BE DISCLOSED TO PATIENTS BEFOREHAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A doctor's group that wants to bring spirituality into the examining room is 
encouraging physicians to discuss not only prescriptions and surgery with 
patients, but God, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christian Medical & Dental Society is an interdenominational organization 
of about 9,000 doctors and dentists. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is, we need to change the physicians, the nurses, the people 
that provide the care," said Dr. David Stevens, the new general director of the 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 "Physicians need to be more than just people that provide physical healing, 
but also those who can give spiritual counseling," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The society organizes volunteer medical work around the world, supports 
missionaries and encourages medical students and doctors to practice their 
faith on the job and off. 
</P>
<P>
 The group opposes euthanasia, surrogate motherhood and abortion, except to 
save a woman's life. While it has no official position on birth control, a 
doctor writes in the current issue of the society's magazine that physicians 
should not prescribe birth control pills for unmarried women. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, the Christian Medical & Dental Society, which raises its $3 million 
annual budget from dues and donations, sends 1,500 doctors, dentists, nurses 
and volunteers on about 50 volunteer medical programs for two weeks or more. 
The group also is trying to encourage doctors to donate their services more in 
U.S. inner cities and impoverished rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think medicine is a natural outreach of the Christian church," Stevens 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people come into a physician's office, they're thinking about serious 
things and they're ready for change in the way they behave, in the lifestyles. 
Christian physicians are in an ideal place to share more than just pills, more 
than just surgery, but to share something that means more to them than their 
profession. That's their faith in Jesus Christ," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some consumer medical advocates and bioethicists said they believe 
physicians should let patients know beforehand if they will not carry out 
practices that are considered the medical standard, whatever the religious, 
moral or philosophical reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue becomes one of disclosure. What I think they have to be sure to do 
is let their patients know what the value basis is they operate from," said Dr. 
Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of

PACIFICA FANS CHEER THESE SONG-AND-DANCE ROUTINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times' attack on Pacifica High School's cheerleaders (Oct. 29) was vicious 
and shallow. Pacifica's cheer squad can be ranked among the best in Orange 
County, both in athletic ability and in dedication to supporting Pacifica's 
teams, win or lose.If you think the dance routine at the end of the first 
quarter (Oct. 28) was a little long and complex, maybe you should reconsider 
why people come at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents, students and other fans come to see not only the game, but the band, 
the drill team and, yes, the cheerleaders. Their performances are often as 
entertaining, and it is their fans' (support) that sustains a great 
end-of-the-week evening format for all students to participate in. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, The Times is under the impression that this is professional 
sports, or believes we should foster the sexist notion that cheerleaders are 
best when they shake their fannies at appropriate lulls in the "real show." Get 
with it! And stop dumping garbage on people who work hard to make this a fun 
experience. Since when did crowd noise while the other team has the ball 
warrant scorn?

 Regarding "Should a Coach Know if a Player Is in Trouble" (Oct. 29), I was 
appalled at: 
</P>
<P>
 1. The inference that the misdemeanor charges against the USC players were 
comparable to the attempted murder charge of the Cal State Northridge player. 
</P>
<P>
 2. The invasion of privacy of these players. 
</P>
<P>
 3. The continued implication that all JC players are high risk. 
</P>
<P>
 4. In the original recruiting article last spring, The Times reporter showed a 
complete lack of knowledge of JC admission requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happened to the American principle of giving kids credit when they 
were able to escape the problems of their environment and past and make 
successes out of themselves?

being academically unqualified.  
</P>

 How nice to read an article on Marijon Ancich (Oct. 21) and how he brought 
back the St. Paul Swordsmen to a place of prominence in prep football.Those of 
us who knew him as the wingback on San Pedro High's 1950 championship team 
could not help but notice his age listed as 56. The rest of the class of June, 
1951, blew out 61 candles on their last birthday. Could it be that he has 
confused his own age with younger brother Hendi, the NFL official? Evidently, 
high school coaching keeps a man young.

 It is important for all those who call themselves Raider fans to note a few 
things: 
</P>
<P>
 1. The Raiders historically have their best years under adverse conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Jeff Hostetler is a winner -- something we've lacked since Jim Plunkett. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Forget the statistics (they don't apply when speaking of the Raiders). 
We've got the best defense, man for man, in the NFL. The offense will catch up 
to it over the remainder of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 4. It's not where a team starts but where it finishes that counts. 
</P>
<P>
 One final thought for all the naysayers: Will you say that you knew it all 
along when we smoke the Cowboys in Miami in January? I thought so.

OFF THE TICKER: RING ONE UP FOR INFIGHTING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Meijer Inc., a big Midwest retailing company, has declared Army personnel 
unauthorized -- Salvation Army bell ringers, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 The grocery and department store chain said it was forced to ban the bell 
ringers and their Christmas donation kettles after a labor board ruled earlier 
this year that if it allowed bell ringers, it would also have to allow striking 
union pickets. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute stems from a 55-day strike over wages at four Toledo, Ohio-area 
stores. Meijer imposed a ban on solicitations in front of its 86 stores in 
Michigan, Ohio and Indiana to keep pickets away. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said the real Scrooge is the United Food and Commercial Food 
Workers. The union's complaint prompted the National Labor Relations Board 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because they do not want us in front of their stores, they have refused to 
allow any charitable organizations in front of their stores," countered John 
Mulkey, organizing director for UFCW Local 954 in Toledo.

PACKAGING MADE PERFECT; GONE ARE THE DAYS OF PICKING OUT THE REJECTS BY HAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERROL A. COCKFIELD JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever wonder how food packagers get so many perfectly shaped almonds into 
millions of bags stacked on grocery shelves across the land? 
</P>
<P>
 It's simple, according to Key Technology Inc. The Walla Walla, Wash.-based 
maker of machinery for food packaging has developed an assembly line machine 
that quickly scans zillions of almonds, shoots the flawless specimens into one 
basket to fill those attractive packages on the shelf, and sends the chipped 
almonds into another basket for other uses. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of the machine is a highly sophisticated computer with a built-in 
video camera. 
</P>
<P>
 In a similar vein, Eric Holmes, an engineer for White Cap Inc., a Downers 
Grove, Ill.-based packaging concern, says his company has a solution to the 
problem of defective bottle caps and containers that somehow don't get filled 
to food processors' standards in the packaging process. A computer-aided 
vision-detection system scans the assembly line for defective caps and measures 
the level of fluid in containers. "From the time the system determines it's a 
reject, it kicks it off the line," Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such quality-control solutions in food packaging are evolving because of 
computer-aided technology. Long gone are the days when assembly-line workers 
meticulously picked out defective products as they rolled along on a conveyor 
belt. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer technology "gives you an exact separation," said Keith Gait, a sales 
representative for Simco/Ramic Corp., which handles packaging for companies 
such as RJR Nabisco Holding Corp.'s Nabisco Foods Group, which makes Oreo 
cookies, a variety of crackers and other snack foods. 
</P>
<P>
 Simco uses a computer-based shape- and color-sorter machine to package snack 
foods. Instead of having a worker pick out all the yellow Gummi Bears, for 
example, the machine automatically sorts faster and more accurately according 
to a variety of standards, Gait said. He, like Holmes and representatives of 
Key Technology, was in Los Angeles on Friday showing off the newest technology 
in food packaging to a food processors convention. 
</P>
<P>
 For the $400-billion-a-year food processing industry, packaging is almost as 
important as the product itself. Product safety is a major issue, food 
processors say, but efficient packaging can also entice consumers to buy larger 
amounts of a product than they would otherwise, said John B. Perkins, technical 
marketing manager for Mead Corp., an Atlanta-based maker of machinery for food 
packaging. For instance, if a 24-pack of soft drinks can be easily carried, he 
explained, a customer may be more willing to buy it to save time and money. 
</P>
<P>
 Another major concern among food processors is access to cost-efficient 
packaging. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the latest developments in the quest for the most efficient packaging 
machinery involves the use of servomotors, which are more efficient and 
adjustable than chains and sprockets. 
</P>
<P>
 They are ideal for interaction with computers, allowing engineers -- through 
touch-screen programs -- to easily manipulate machines that package beverages.  
</P>
<P>
 Mead has developed the Cluster-Pack 850, a packaging machine run entirely by 
servomotors and high-speed computers. The computer indicates what may go wrong 
in the packaging process and communicates to engineers the necessary 
corrections as it makes periodic diagnostic checks of the Cluster-Pack system. 
The system can produce up to 400 packages a minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "Push a button and by a program in a computer, they (servomotors) know where 
to go," Perkins said. Thus, when packagers change the machine format from a 
six-pack to a 12-pack configuration, it only takes two minutes, rather than 
half an hour of cumbersome sprocket changes, Perkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Changes in the food packaging industry are consumer-driven. It was customer 
suggestions that sent Mead engineers back to the drawing board two years ago to 
design the Cluster-Pack 850 after consumers demanded handier beverage packages. 
</P>
<P>
 In a similar fashion, in the late 1970s, children cut their tongues while 
licking the metal caps of tapioca pudding cups. Philadelphia-based Automated 
Container Corp. designed what manager Bob Morrison calls a "double safe end." 
</P>
<P>
 "We developed a lid where you cannot cut your tongue if you lick it for 
whatever reason," he said.

ENRON MAKES ELECTRIFYING PROPOSAL; ENERGY: THE RESPECTED DEVELOPER ANNOUNCES A 
HUGE SOLAR PLANT AND A BREAKTHROUGH PRICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move that took experts by surprise, Houston-based Enron Corp., a giant 
energy developer, has proposed building the world's largest photovoltaic power 
plant at the Energy Department's Nevada Test Site, near Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally unexpected, in an industry now producing electricity at a pricey 25 
cents a kilowatt-hour, Enron says it will make power at 5.5 cents -- which 
would make power converted directly from sunlight competitive with fossil fuel 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they are successful, they will have defined the photovoltaic market 
overnight," said Tony Catalano, director of photovoltaics at the Energy 
Department's National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colo., the 
principal federal research center for such solar technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Photovoltaic cells, mostly formed from purified silicon sand, are one of two 
forms of solar-generated electricity. Such solar cells have become commonplace 
above highway call boxes, on hand-held calculators and in larger installations 
in remote locations. Solar thermal power, by contrast, is the technology that 
uses the sun to heat water, oil or liquid salt, which is then used in water 
heaters or to run electricity-generating turbines. 
</P>
<P>
 Photovoltaic cells have become steadily more efficient and cost-effective in 
recent years. But the price has remained well above the cost of electricity 
generated by conventional fuels or most other renewable sources of energy. So 
far, only about 400 megawatts of photovoltaic power-generating panels have been 
built at various sites around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Enron proposes building a 100-megawatt, $150-million plant at a single site on 
the former nuclear testing grounds, which the Energy Department would like to 
turn into a solar power enterprise zone. The firm wants the department to 
contract to buy the power at the 5.5-cent price, with a standard 3% price 
escalator clause to include inflation, but with no federal subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say there would be wide skepticism toward such a low-cost proposal if 
it came from a small start-up firm. But Enron is a highly experienced power 
plant builder -- as well as the nation's biggest natural gas provider -- and it 
has been studying the photovoltaic industry for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to lay the gauntlet down unless we can do it," Robert Kelly, 
Enron executive vice president, told the Houston Business Journal, which broke 
the story last week. 
</P>
<P>
 An Enron spokeswoman confirmed the plan Friday but declined to describe the 
company's technology in detail. 
</P>
<P>
 "There really hasn't been too much officially announced about it," agreed Jim 
Birk, manager of renewables and hydro at the Palo Alto-based Electric Power 
Research Institute, which oversees research and development for U.S. electric 
utilities. "But the bottom line is that you have a very credible organization 
with a strong history in the energy business putting forth this proposal."

FORMER VONS PRESIDENT DECRIES PROP. 187; ELECTION: THE GROCERY CHAIN, UNDER 
FIRE FOR ITS SUPPORT OF GOV. PETE WILSON, PAYS FOR NEWSPAPER ADS SIGNED BY 
WILLIAM S. DAVILA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an apparent attempt to defuse a controversy over its campaign support of 
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, Vons Cos. paid for a newspaper ad Friday attacking 
Proposition 187 that was signed by its president emeritus, William S. Davila. 
</P>
<P>
 The full-page ad, which ran in English in Friday's Los Angeles Times and in 
Spanish in the Spanish-language daily La Opinion, did not mention Vons, the 
largest supermarket chain in Southern California.  
</P>
<P>
 But Davila, as the company's president from 1984 to 1992 and as its television 
spokesman, is perhaps the public figure most closely associated with the chain. 
The first-generation Mexican-American and Los Angeles native remains a member 
of its board. 
</P>
<P>
 Davila was unavailable Friday for comment on the ad, which was headlined "A 
Message About Proposition 187," the election ballot proposal that would close 
off many public services to illegal immigrants and require public officials to 
report suspected illegals to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the form of a letter that began "Dear Friends," Davila called 187 "a deeply 
flawed measure that is creating an unhealthy environment in our state." He 
called for a "no" vote on the grounds that 187 could cost an estimated $15 
billion in lost federal funds, drive 300,000 children out of school and "create 
a police state mentality as we would be required to turn in 'suspected' 
undocumented immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, Vons, while acknowledging that it paid for the ad, stressed that 
it has taken no corporate position on Proposition 187. It bought the ad to 
"support (Davila's) desire to communicate his position, because he is our 
president emeritus and a member of our board of directors," spokeswoman Julie 
Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 Political advertisements in major newspapers such as The Times can cost upward 
of $50,000 per full page. 
</P>
<P>
 Vons has come under heavy criticism within the Latino community for its 
campaign support of Wilson, whose reelection bid is helping to promote 
Proposition 187 and is riding the coattails of public sentiment against illegal 
immigration.  
</P>
<P>
 The activist group Chicanos Unidos, for example, on Oct. 5 called for a 
boycott of Vons and three other large corporate contributors -- Atlantic 
Richfield Co., Walt Disney Co. and E&J Gallo Winery -- because of their support 
of Wilson. Several Vons supermarkets have been the sites of anti-187 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 A Chicanos Unidos member, Alex Jacinto, said Friday: "I think it was very 
commendable of Mr. Davila to spend his money on this ad. If he didn't, then 
he's being used, and that's a shame." 
</P>
<P>
 Vons responded to the boycott campaign last month with a statement noting that 
it has contributed not only to Wilson's gubernatorial campaign but to that of 
his Democratic challenger, Kathleen Brown, and to other gubernatorial 
candidates.  
</P>
<P>
 "Vons does not have a position on Proposition 187, and it is wrong to assume 
that we support a proposition that a candidate who received a campaign 
contribution from us supports," Reynolds said.  
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds said the company contributed $50,000 to Wilson's campaign earlier 
this year; state campaign records put the total at $56,000 going back to 1993. 
Reynolds declined to state the size of the contribution to Brown's campaign but 
said it came in August and later, after the period for which state records are 
currently available. She also declined to say which of the other candidates for 
governor received contributions from Vons.

IBM, APPLE AND MOTOROLA IN PC ACCORD; TECHNOLOGY: THE ALLIANCE ON HARDWARE 
DESIGN IS INTENDED TO BREAK THE DOMINANCE OF INTEL AND MICROSOFT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three years after they decided to work together on a new type of computer 
chip, IBM, Apple Computer and Motorola plan to announce on Monday a 
much-anticipated agreement on a standard design for personal computers that use 
those chips. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say it is too soon to tell whether the new PC "platform," due in 1996 
at the earliest, will be compelling enough to do more than nibble at the 85% 
market share held by machines using chips from Intel Corp. and software from 
Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 But they agree that the initiative gives the industry its best shot yet at 
breaking what is viewed as an Intel-Microsoft stranglehold. The new machines 
will be based on the PowerPC chip, the powerful microprocessor that was 
developed by the three partners and is used in the latest Apple Macintosh 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This creates for the first time a serious second standard around a processor 
architecture other than Intel's," said Andrew Gore, executive editor for news 
at MacWeek, a trade publication that reports on the Macintosh market. 
</P>
<P>
 The machines would be able to run a variety of computer operating systems from 
Apple, IBM, Novell, Sun and others. They would thus, in theory, give customers 
not only more raw computer power, but also greater flexibility and a broad 
array of software applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Canon Corp., Toshiba Corp. and other smaller companies are expected to 
announce Monday that they will build computers based on the new standard. 
</P>
<P>
 As they finally put aside their differences, IBM and Apple will certainly be 
presenting a more unified front against the Intel-Microsoft juggernaut. 
International Business Machines Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. have been allied 
with Motorola Inc. in developing the PowerPC chips, but until now machines 
based on those chips -- including the well-received PowerMacintosh systems -- 
have shared few important design features. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM will continue to make Intel-based machines even after the rollout of the 
new machines to be designed with Apple. The agreement on a standard was reached 
after months of haggling over technical and financial details and what 
direction the venture should take. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., nor IBM would comment officially on 
the announcement planned for Monday in New York. Most observers said that one 
component key to Apple's survival will be missing: a deal with another party 
for licensing Apple's Macintosh operating system. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of the new hardware design will ultimately depend on the quality 
of the software operating systems and applications that can be run on the 
machines. Analysts agree the Macintosh operating system needs to build a 
broader customer base if it is to attract quality applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple Chief Executive Michael Spindler has said that Apple would announce 
licensing pacts for the "Mac OS" before year's end, and some observers 
speculated that Apple must be planning to announce such a deal closer to 
Comdex, a huge industry trade show opening Nov. 13 in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, IBM is struggling to complete a version of its OS/2 operating 
system to run on the new PowerPC-based machines, which will also run 
sophisticated corporate computing operating systems such as Netware, Solaris, 
Windows NT and, eventually, Taligent. 
</P>
<P>
 Though long overdue in many analysts' estimation, the timing of the common 
IBM-Apple platform's debut could yet prove lucky, some said. Both Intel and 
Microsoft are going through transitions as they develop next-generation 
products and are displaying "some vulnerability," said Pieter Hartsook, 
publisher of the Hartsook Letter, an Alameda, Calif.-based Macintosh market 
research service. 
</P>
<P>
 The PowerPC designs promise to be extremely competitive in terms of 
performance for the price, but Apple, in particular, must hustle if it hopes to 
bolster its position. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time is running out," said Kimball Brown, an analyst with Dataquest Inc., a 
market research firm in San Jose.

 Alleghany Cleared to Boost Its Stake in Santa Fe: Alleghany Corp. received 
antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission to buy as much as 15% of 
the common stock of Santa Fe Pacific Corp. Santa Fe Pacific has been the object 
of a bidding war between two rival railroads, Burlington Northern Inc. and 
Union Pacific Corp. Alleghany has no intention of acquiring Santa Fe Pacific, 
said Hunter Hallowell, managing director and equity analyst at Shelby Cullom 
Davis in New York. It merely wants "to make money on their investment in the 
company," Hallowell said. His firm, which has $900 million in net equity 
capital, has been a shareholder in Alleghany since 1987.

 Kerkorian May Increase Stake in Chrysler: Investor Kirk Kerkorian said Friday 
that he is considering ways to enhance the value of his 9% stake in Chrysler 
Corp. In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Kerkorian 
said he is exploring a broad range of alternatives, including the purchase of 
additional shares, the sale of stock and even an "extraordinary corporate 
transaction, such as a merger." However, he appeared to be listing a takeover 
of the auto giant among a laundry list of possibilities, as required by SEC 
rules, rather than as a specific plan.The paperwork was required because 
Kerkorian is considering major changes in plans for his shares, which account 
for the single largest stake in the auto maker. Chrysler shares fell 62.5 cents 
to $47.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.

FARMERS PROMOTION POINTS TO LIKELY SUCCESSOR; INSURANCE: NEW PRESIDENT MARTIN 
D. FEINSTEIN APPEARS TO BE IN LINE TO TAKE REINS FROM CHAIRMAN LEO E. DENLEA 
JR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the elevation of Martin D. Feinstein, 46, to president and chief 
operating officer, Farmers Insurance Group appears to be naming a likely 
successor to the company's chairman and chief executive, Leo E. Denlea Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 The promotion, announced Thursday and effective Jan. 1, gives Feinstein -- 
currently a senior vice president -- two of the four titles formerly held by 
Denlea, who at age 62 is three years from the Los Angeles-based company's 
traditional retirement age. 
</P>
<P>
 (Due to an editing error, in most editions Friday The Times incorrectly stated 
that Feinstein would succeed Denlea on Jan. 1. Denlea will remain chairman and 
chief executive, positions he has held since 1986.) 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers' next-highest-ranking officer is Executive Vice President William H. 
Braddock, 59. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, who joined Farmers in 1969, has "risen like a rocket" in recent 
years, involving himself in some of the company's highest-priority projects, 
according to an industry source who asked not to be identified. For instance, 
Feinstein headed a $300-million computerization project to promote efficiency 
in claims processing and improved customer service. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers, California's third-largest homeowners and auto insurer, had been 
regarded within the industry as stodgy and somewhat backward in terms of 
technological development. Founded in California in 1928, the insurer is now a 
unit of Britain-based BAT Industries. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing Feinstein's promotion, Farmers also unveiled details of an 
internal reorganization that will give increased independence to its life 
insurance, commercial insurance and personal lines (auto and homeowners) 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the reorganization, each of the three core units will have its own 
underwriting, claims handling, research and product development departments, 
instead of sharing those functions in a centralized way. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the reorganization takes effect Jan. 1, Farmers said it will name 
executives to head each of the three units.

 GM Downsizes Production Goals Again: The auto maker slashed 27,000 vehicles 
from its worldwide production schedule for the fourth quarter, blaming slow 
introductions of new models, parts shortages and time lost to a strike earlier 
this year.It was the second time in two months GM cut its fourth-quarter output 
schedule. The company said it hopes to build 2,116,000 vehicles worldwide in 
the quarter, down from an October projection of 2,143,000. For plants in the 
United States, Canada and Mexico, GM lowered its sights by 16,000 vehicles to 
1,491,000 vehicles. The figures include joint-venture plants in Canada and 
California.

FORD RECALLS TRUCKS TO FIX PARKING BRAKES; AUTOS: 893,000 VEHICLES ARE 
AFFECTED. SAFETY OF SEAT BELTS IN PROBE CARS IS ALSO UNDER SCRUTINY. 
</P>

<P>
 Ford Motor Co. said Friday that it is recalling 893,000 Bronco, Ranger and 
F-series trucks and Explorer sport utility vehicles to fix a problem with the 
parking brakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The parking brakes on certain 1992-94 model F-Series and Broncos and 1993-94 
model Rangers and Explorers equipped with manual transmissions may not engage 
when the pedals are depressed, which could allow the vehicles to roll, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford said it has received 44 reports alleging the condition resulted in 
property-damage accidents, as well as one injury report. 
</P>
<P>
 About 45,000 of the trucks are in Canada, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford said owners are being notified to return the trucks to dealers for 
installation of a wedge in the parking brake control at no charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The service takes about 30 minutes, but Ford said some dealerships may need to 
keep vehicles longer to accommodate service schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development Friday, the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration upgraded its investigation into the safety of motorized seat 
belt systems in 1990-91 model Ford Probe cars after receiving hundreds of 
complaints from owners. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the agency's monthly vehicle defect report, the NHTSA has 
received 828 complaints about malfunctions of the seat belt systems. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, drivers have complained that the automatic belt guide fails to 
go all the way to the top of the track along the door. 
</P>
<P>
 NHTSA spokesman Tim Hurd said the problem has been associated with 27 crashes, 
23 injuries and five fatalities. About 183,340 Probe cars use the system. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ford spokeswoman said the company is cooperating with the NHTSA 
investigation but believes there is nothing wrong with the belt system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the vehicles are safe," she said.

theme park outside Paris.

 FTD Rejects New Teleflora Offer: The No. 1 floral delivery network said its 
board turned down a third unsolicited takeover bid from its Los Angeles-based 
rival. An earlier offer from New York merchant bank Perry Capital Corp. is 
expected to be accepted by a majority of Detroit-based FTD's 20,000 florist 
members.FTD's board approved that deal in July. Teleflora President Gregg 
Coccari said his company will make no further offer. Teleflora's purchase price 
would have been reduced by $11 million, the amount FTD has agreed to pay Perry 
if it accepts a higher bid, Coccari said. FTD's board also wanted Teleflora to 
agree to pay it $17 million if the deal failed federal antitrust review; 
Teleflora had offered to pay $10 million.

 Greyhound Challenges Bondholders' Petition: Greyhound Lines Inc. said 
bondholders seeking to declare the company bankrupt have no legal right to 
demand faster payments on bonds on which it defaulted in September.Greyhound 
also said the bankruptcy petition would prevent it from speeding up the bond 
payments. Greyhound, the nation's largest bus line, failed to pay $4.2 million 
in interest on $98.9 million of convertible debentures on Sept. 30 and has been 
negotiating to restructure the debt. Bondholders claiming to hold about 25% of 
the debt filed on Greyhound's behalf for Chapter 11 bankruptcy status in the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Court's Northern District of Texas.

 Nissan's Losses Widen Due to Strong Yen: Japan's second-largest auto maker 
said its net losses were sharply worse in the first half of the fiscal year as 
a result of slumping domestic sales and an unfavorable exchange rate.Nissan 
Motor Co. put its net loss at $548 million for the six months ended Sept. 30. 
Nissan lost $335 million in the same period last year. Increases in the yen's 
value over the past year have eaten away at export profits as they are 
converted to the Japanese currency. Nissan abandoned its earlier prediction 
that it would break even for the year and projected a net loss of $613 million.

 The Clippers, who have had only one winning season since moving to Los Angeles 
in 1984, are listed at a million-to-1 to win the NBA title by a Las Vegas 
oddsmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 If Friday night's season-opening 121-100 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers in 
Yokohama, Japan, was any indication, you could probably get much better odds on 
the Clippers' chances for posting the worst record in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA, which is trying to expand its fan base in Japan, would be wise not to 
send the Clippers overseas anymore if it wants to attract new fans. 
</P>
<P>
 But new Clipper Coach Bill Fitch, who rebuilt four other NBA teams, didn't 
expect it to be easy when he was hired to replace Bob Weiss, who was fired 
after the Clippers finished with a 27-55 record last season, the seventh-worst 
in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch, whose team trailed by as many as 35 points in the fourth quarter, could 
have used former Clippers Danny Manning, Ron Harper, Dominique Wilkins and Mark 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who lack a scoring threat, could use one like free agent Chris 
Webber of the Golden State Warriors. Bill Strickland, Webber's agent, said the 
Clippers have shown interest in Webber, the 1994 rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper spokesman Joe Safety, reached in Japan, denied a report out of the Bay 
Area that the club has tendered a $130-million, 14-year offer sheet to Webber. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything can happen on this one, but it would be very difficult to structure 
an offer that wouldn't be matched in all likelihood," Safety said. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber, the first player selected in the 1993 draft, is a restricted free 
agent and the Warriors would have 15 days to match any offer. The Clippers have 
a $3.5-million salary slot available. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, forward Lamond Murray and swingman Eric Piatkowski, the Clippers' 
top draft picks, got a rude welcome to the NBA before 14,239 at the Yokohama 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, who sat out the first two weeks of training camp before signing a 
$13.5-million, five-year deal on Oct. 21, looked out of shape. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray missed an eight-foot shot off a four-on-one break in the second quarter 
and dribbled the ball off his leg after losing concentration as the Clippers 
had 11 first-half turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 In one second-quarter sequence, Piatkowski had a shot blocked by Trail Blazer 
center Chris Dudley and then shot an airball on an ensuing three-pointer. 
Portland guard Clyde Drexler, who had 26 points, eight rebounds and four 
assists, spun around Piatkowski for an easy layup at the other end of the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 Trail Blazer guard Rod Strickland said Drexler, who has been slowed by 
injuries in recent seasons, is in the best shape of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's feeling real good about himself," Strickland said. "The past few years 
he's had some injuries and that's kind of set him back. But he's come in with a 
great attitude and he worked hard in the preseason." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper rookie center Matt Fish was one of the team's few bright spots, 
scoring 10 points in a reserve role. 
</P>
<P>
 The game marked P.J. Carlesimo's NBA coaching debut. Carlesimo, who led Seton 
Hall to the final game of the NCAA tournament in 1989, signed a $7-million, 
five-year contract to coach the Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cliff Robinson had 22 points and Strickland 17 points and seven assists for 
the Trail Blazers. Reserve guard Tracy Murray had 14 points in 17 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Terry Dehere had a team-high 19 points for the Clippers, and forward Loy 
Vaught had 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray finished with nine points. Piatkowski missed six of seven shots and had 
four points. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst rebounding team in the NBA last season, the Clippers were 
outrebounded, 55-39. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams meet again tonight. Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who return home Sunday, open their home season against the 
Atlanta Hawks on Thursday night at the Sports Arena. . . . Clipper guard Randy 
Woods, who suffered a dizzy spell during practice Thursday, played Friday 
night. . . . Tony Massenburg, who played the last two seasons for F.C. 
Barcelona in the Spanish League, started at small forward for the Clippers.

VAN EXEL MOVES LAKER CAMPAIGN OUT TO HOT START; PRO BASKETBALL: POINT GUARD 
RENEGES A BIT ON PROMISE, BUT BLISTERS PISTONS WITH CAREER-HIGH 35 POINTS IN 
115-98 ROUT.

 How appropriate. A broken campaign promise. 
</P>
<P>
 The pass-more, shoot-less platform from Nick Van Exel during training camp 
lasted all the way until opening night, the first half of opening night to be 
more specific, at which point it disappeared quicker than Anthony Peeler. The 
Detroit Pistons weren't far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to the site of one of his biggest games as a rookie, Van Exel had 
more three-pointers than assists. Leading the offense instead of generating it, 
he made 11 of 15 shots and scored a career-high 35 points. And, of course, he 
has the Lakers' endorsement to do this, as long as the results are similar to 
the 115-98 victory Friday night before 21,454 at the Palace of Auburn Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for truth in advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard when you're on fire," said Van Exel, whose six three-pointers in 
nine tries tied a franchise record for the third time. "When the fellas on the 
team tell you to keep shooting, you keep putting it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cedric Ceballos, who had 22 points and 14 rebounds in his Laker debut: "I 
don't know what they (the Pistons) were thinking. They backed off him and let 
him play the three. That is like giving him a layup." 
</P>
<P>
 On this night, anyway. Other times, letting him fire away is the best defense 
(see: three of 16 on three-pointers, April 24 in the final game last season), 
but the Pistons should have realized early this was not one of those times. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Exel, who also had four assists, made both three-pointers in the first 
quarter. He added two more in the second quarter to help the Lakers to a 57-54 
lead at halftime. A fifth came before the end of the third quarter, by which 
time he had 28 points and the advantage was up to 90-78. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit closed within 92-87 with 7:58 left, but the Lakers never relinquished 
the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 They pushed it back to eight, then got the last and biggest of Van Exel's 
three-pointers for an 11-point cushion and some breathing room. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a spectacular display," Coach Del Harris said. "He was good. Not just 
the 35 points. He played a very, very good basketball game in addition to 
scoring 35 points." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Piston Coach Don Chaney: "Van Exel took over the game and he made the 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 The reserves took over the offense from there. The strange part was which 
ones: Elden Campbell and Tony Smith combined to score the next 12 points down 
the stretch as the Lakers cruised to victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Peeler? 
</P>
<P>
 The deposed starter obviously has bigger problems now than merely outplaying 
rookie Eddie Jones to regain his starting spot at shooting guard. Arguably the 
best scoring threat off the bench, Peeler didn't even play, and it had nothing 
to do with his sprained left wrist. It had everything to do with Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Anthony before the game that for now he's not going to play much," 
said Harris, who used both Smith and Sedale Threatt at that spot. "Other guys 
are playing well and Anthony is struggling. The wrist is a problem, and until 
he gets his game going he's just going to have to keep working hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "He shot 33% in the preseason and he's a shooter . . . . It's a circle, 
though. It'll come back to him as long as he works hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Does Trevor Ruffin know something? With trade rumors swirling around Peeler, 
the rookie point guard has maintained his residence at a Los Angeles hotel 
despite being cut Thursday as the roster was trimmed to 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever it takes to win," said Peeler, who started every game he played 
during an injury-riddled 1993-94. "I just have to wait for my time to come and 
get healthy. It's all a mental thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pistons got 25 points, 10 rebounds and three blocked shots in a 
spectacular rookie debut by Grant Hill and 20 points and 10 rebounds from Terry 
Mills. Those two combined to put George Lynch in foul trouble and give his new 
role as the starting power forward an aborted start. Lynch played only 17 
minutes, an absence that was compensated by strong bench play from Campbell and 
Sam Bowie. 
</P>
<P>

GOODEN BANNED FOR NEXT SEASON; BASEBALL: ALREADY SUSPENDED ONCE THIS YEAR, FREE 
AGENT PITCHER IS PENALIZED FOR REPEATED DRUG VIOLATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 If there is a 1995 baseball season, pitcher Dwight Gooden doesn't figure to be 
a part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden, whose problems with cocaine surfaced seven years ago, was banned 
Friday for the entire season by major league baseball for repeated drug 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden, who will turn 30 in two weeks, already had been suspended once this 
year after testing positive for drugs. He was treated at the Betty Ford Center 
last summer, but then tested positive again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dwight Gooden needs to get his life in order," said Joe McIlvaine, general 
manager of the New York Mets, Gooden's team before he became a free agent last 
month. "Dwight needs to realize the problem and come to grips with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been offered the best assistance baseball and the New York Mets have 
to give for his problem and he has not taken advantage of this guidance and 
help. All of us who love this man urge him to get the help he needs, put God 
into his life and exhibit the same tenacity he showed on the mound, especially 
in the early years of his career, when a lead in the seventh inning meant a 
victory in the ninth." 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden was with the Mets for all of his 11-year career before becoming a free 
agent on Oct. 24. By the time he was 21, he had been National League rookie of 
the year and a Cy Young Award winner. But six months after leading the Mets to 
a World Series title in 1986, he admitted to a cocaine problem and voluntarily 
entered a treatment center. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he has been tested by baseball as many as three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, however, he failed four drug tests. He was suspended from baseball 
for 60 days on June 28 for failing two tests and then, in September, he tested 
positive twice more. Because of the still unresolved player strike, Gooden had 
15 days remaining of the 60-day suspension.  
</P>
<P>
 Gooden's agent, Jim Neader, met with the pitcher for about an hour Friday at 
Gooden's home in St. Petersburg, Fla. Gooden chose not to speak publicly, but 
probably will make a statement next week, Neader said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's determined to beat it and get back to 100% health," Neader told the 
Associated Press. "And when that is achieved, then we'll think about baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 The Major League Players Assn. has the right to challenge the suspension 
through its grievance procedure, which would be heard by arbitrator George 
Nicolau. The union had no comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden has been a larger-than-life figure in New York. A multistory portrait 
of him on the mound is painted on the side of a building in mid-town Manhattan, 
visible to all exiting the Lincoln Tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
 After helping lead the Mets past the Boston Red Sox in the 1986 World Series, 
Gooden won 15 or more games in four of the next five seasons. He was 13-7 in 
1991, and hasn't been back to .500 since. He is the last Met from the 1986 
championship team. 
</P>
<P>
 McIlvaine, who has spoken with Neader about re-signing the right-hander, had 
only one message Friday: Get help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dwight needs to demonstrate that same degree of competitiveness to defeat a 
far more insidious enemy that is sucking the life out of him, both personally 
and professionally," McIlvaine said. 
</P>
<P>
 The last player to serve a one-year suspension was New York Yankee pitcher 
Pascual Perez in 1992. In 1988, Seattle Mariner John Rabb was suspended 
indefinitely for not complying with baseball's drug-testing program. In 1983, 
Dodger pitcher Steve Howe and the Kansas City's Willie Aikens also served 
one-year suspensions.

SNOW, SLUSH AND COUGARS AWAIT TROJANS; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: IT COULD BE TOUGH 
SLEDDING IN PULLMAN, WHERE ROSE BOWL HOPES MIGHT BE DECIDED BY THE WEATHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 USC and Washington State meet in a football game crucial to the Rose Bowl race 
today, but forecasters are predicting weather more suitable for the Iditarod. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow fell all day Friday in eastern Washington, and the prediction was for 
slightly warmer weather today, with a 60% chance of morning snow turning to 
rain in the afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
 Whatever, John Robinson will send his Trojans onto the artificial turf of 
Washington State's 40,000-seat Martin Stadium, no doubt following a pregame 
message that they can forget about Pasadena should they fail today.  
</P>
<P>
 It's a matchup of half the Pac-10 teams currently with 4-1 records, with three 
to play. Another 4-1 team, Arizona, plays Cal today and the fourth, Oregon, 
plays Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 USC, 5-2 overall and winner of three in a row, has Arizona at home next 
Saturday and UCLA at the Rose Bowl Nov. 19. Robinson's team needs them all, and 
also needs some team to knock off Oregon, to reach the Rose Bowl game.  
</P>
<P>
 Washington State, 6-2 overall, has won two in a row and plays at Oregon State 
next Saturday, then finishes at home Nov. 19 against Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 USC's challenge today is a defense that leads the nation in run defense, 
giving up 58 yards a game, and scoring defense, giving up 10.4 points. The 
Cougars' senior-dominated defense has given up a conference-leading 108 first 
downs and 22 third-down conversions, also best in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington State is six points away from being an 8-0 team. The Cougars' two 
losses were to Tennessee, 10-9, and Arizona, 10-7. 
</P>
<P>
 USC's two losses were to Penn State, 38-14, and Oregon, 22-7.  
</P>
<P>
 The Cougar defense is no surprise to Coach Mike Price.  
</P>
<P>
 "We expected this to be an outstanding defense, and it has surpassed my 
expectations," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, we were very, very good (on defense) and this year we're better." 
</P>
<P>
 USC's defense gives up far more yards than does Washington State's -- 406 a 
game, compared to WSU's 216 -- but the Trojans, too, make big plays. In fact, 
Robinson's team leads the nation in average turnover margin, plus-1.9. 
</P>
<P>
 USC, after collecting only 26 turnovers all last season, has 19 this year -- 
11 interceptions and eight fumble recoveries -- and has fumbled only six times 
itself, and not once in its last 15quarters.  
</P>
<P>
 But in sloppy weather, of course, all bets are off.  
</P>
<P>
 Robinson has his most potent weapon back for today's game, quarterback Rob 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidelined for the equivalent of three games with an ankle sprain, the senior 
quarterback has healed sufficiently to start today. Psychologically, Johnson's 
presence has to at least unnerve Washington State's veteran defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars came to the Coliseum a year ago with another vaunted defense and 
Johnson and receiver Johnnie Morton cut it to pieces in a 34-3 victory. Johnson 
passed for a career-high 392 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, a major concern for USC is depth at guard. Protecting Johnson against 
two outstanding Washington State defensive tackles, Don Sasa and Chad Eaton, 
will be Kris Pollack and Kyle Ramsay.  
</P>
<P>
 If either of those two can't finish, position-switching would be required. USC 
became thin at guard when starters Phalen Pounds and Chris Brymer were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Filling in for left guard Brymer, who has a sprained ankle, will be Andre 
Abrams. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Marcus Bonds, like Brymer, didn't make the trip. He also has an 
ankle sprain and will be replaced by Willie Lowery. Donn Cunnigan will start at 
inside linebacker over Errick Herrin, who has a thigh bruise.

ANSWERS FOR MOORER SHOULD COME TONIGHT; BOXING: PERFORMANCE AGAINST FOREMAN, 
45, WILL SAY A LOT ABOUT THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The questions bare for Michael Moorer, because George Foreman answered all of 
his, for better or worse, long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Moorer strong enough, talented enough and, most important, brave enough to 
beat down the larger, older and far more savvy 45-year-old once and faded 
heavyweight champion? 
</P>
<P>
 Was Moorer's heavyweight title-winning victory over Evander Holyfield last 
April a sign of a fighter growing toward greatness or of a tightly wound 
technician lucking into a bout with a worn-down champion who was confused by 
Moorer's left-handed style? 
</P>
<P>
 At stake tonight in the MGM Grand Garden are Moorer's International Boxing 
Federation and World Boxing Assn. titles, Foreman's shot at history, and, maybe 
most of all, Moorer's none-too-certain hold on his emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Teddy Atlas, Moorer's trainer, has said he knows exactly what Foreman's 
tactics will be. In order to beat Moorer (35-0, 30 knockouts), Atlas says, 
Foreman (72-4, 67 KOs) must overwhelm the champion early, when Moorer's nerves 
are jangling and Foreman's endurance is not under siege.  
</P>
<P>
 The only way Moorer can lose, Atlas says, is if he is tricked into giving up, 
just as Muhammad Ali tricked Foreman out of the title 20 years ago in Zaire 
with a rope-a-dope plan that succeeded brilliantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want Foreman to have a psychological edge going into the fight," 
Atlas said. "I told him Foreman was using that like a younger fighter uses a 
jab. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Foreman) feels he has a trump card. He realizes he quit in Zaire against 
Ali, and that he will not let it happen again. That's what he's saying. But I 
expected that. George thinks he's going to do what Ali did. Instead of 
rope-a-dope, he's going to walk forward and try to take Michael's will. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's trying to con Michael into not believing in himself, that he can beat 
Michael by walking forward, that he's an immovable object and try to break him 
down mentally. But Michael's ready to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The 222-pound Moorer sparred against a virtual NFL offensive line of partners 
during his nine-week camp to prepare him for Foreman's 250 pounds of power and 
leverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman, the oldest man ever to challenge for the heavyweight title, appears 
in better shape than at any time since his 1991 title bout against Holyfield, 
when he gave the then-champion 12 reasonably hard rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 And he says that people who think his only chance is a quick and devastating 
knockout are oversimplifying his style. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are all kinds of ways I can whup Michael Moorer," Foreman said. "If 
Michael Moorer jabs and I jab, I'm going to beat him to the jab. I can move. I 
can box. You can't live in this world long without being able to box. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing Michael Moorer can do to me is what I let him do. He cannot 
say the same things considering George Foreman. If the bell rings and I charge 
him, he can't stop me. If I start swinging a lot of punches at him, he cannot 
do anything about it. He's got to wait until I stop. Not with me. If he starts 
swinging a lot of punches at me, all I've got to do is swing back, and he'll 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing he's got, everybody's saying he's young. But that's not enough 
in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman, who has been inactive since he lost in June of last year to Tommy 
Morrison, points to Holyfield's early knockdown of Moorer as evidence that 
Moorer is ready to go down for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say Evander hit me with 50 unanswered shots at one point. But then what 
happened? He held me," Foreman said. "He hit Michael Moorer with one shot, what 
happened? He went down." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorer and Atlas have been working on staying at medium distance from Foreman 
-- not running away, but not close enough where Foreman can bully him -- and 
peppering Foreman with quick shots to the body and head. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1992 victory over Alex Stewart, Foreman's face swelled up badly after 
absorbing several hard shots, and the Moorer camp thinks Moorer's hard right 
jab and counterpunching could achieve that again. 
</P>
<P>
 "George wants me to sit there and slug with him," Moorer said. "I'd be a fool. 
He's a lot bigger man. He can probably punch a lot harder than I can." 
</P>
<P>
 The key, Atlas says finally, is the rhythm of the fight. Moorer, 26, is not 
known as a quick starter, but if he keeps throwing crisp punches, Foreman might 
not have the endurance to stay with him in the later rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Foreman) can't match him physically," Atlas said. "He needs to grab for 
things that are on the outskirts. He's going to use his experience to try to 
get Michael to fight at a slow pace when he wants him to and then pick his 
spots, to have runs at Michael, and keep it slow in the meantime so he'll be 
around for those runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want Michael to fight a disciplined fight. But at the same time, I've told 
him that we have a car that's a very old model car in Foreman. And those cars 
look nice when they're sitting in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you don't see them going down the highways 60 m.p.h. And I want to make 
this car go 60." Tale of the Tape 
</P>
<P>
 The tale of the tape for the IBF and WBA heavyweight title fight between

THE LUSTER MAY RETURN FOR LUKAS; EIGHT TOP CONTENDERS COULD MEAN DOMINATION IN 
TODAY'S BREEDERS' CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A magnificent-looking chestnut, Flanders emerged from Barn 44 at Churchill 
Downs a few mornings ago, for her final pre-Breeders' Cup tuneup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's her highness," trainer Wayne Lukas said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanders epitomizes what has happened to the Lukas stable since it went 2 1/2 
years without winning a major race, since its 10-year run as national training 
champion ended with Bobby Frankel's taking the title last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lukas outfit also hasn't won a Breeders' Cup race since 1989, a barren 
stretch during which 22 horses ran in 18 of these million-dollar races. 
</P>
<P>
 That last impediment to the resurrection of a dynasty could end today at 
Churchill Downs, where the 59-year-old Lukas has the firepower to enjoy another 
day like that drizzly fall afternoon here in 1988, when he started 12 horses in 
six of the seven races and came away with three winners, three second-place 
finishers and a third-place runner. 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas was 1-2-3 in the Juvenile Fillies Stakes that day, and his four-horse 
fusillade of Flanders, Cat Appeal, Lilly Capote and Serena's Song give him a 
chance for another sweep today. Lukas, who ran only two horses in last year's 
Breeders' Cup, has eight in the 11th annual event. Besides the 2-year-old filly 
quartet, he will saddle Timber Country in the Juvenile, Chimes Band and Harlan 
in the Sprint and Tabasco Cat in the $3-million Classic, the richest race on a 
$10-million card. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a competitive bunch," Lukas said. "It'd be nice, I guess, to have 
been able to scatter some of the fillies around, such as having one in the 
Distaff. But as tough as the Distaff's going to be, maybe it's just as well. We 
had our best day here in '88, but the scenario going in is always one that can 
change. I like my horses, but it's going to be hard to dominate all of these 
fields." 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas has won 10 Breeders' Cup races, twice as many as Shug McGaughey and Neil 
Drysdale, who share second place in the trainers' standings. With 79 starters, 
Lukas also has 11 seconds and eight thirds, and his $8.9-million Breeders' Cup 
purse total puts him $5 million ahead of McGaughey, who is second on that list. 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas has bristled at criticism directed at his operation during the relative 
hard times of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to defend myself for 1992, even though the stable earned almost $10 
million," he said the other day. 
</P>
<P>
 The $9.8-million purse total in 1992 was enough to lead the country, but it 
was far below the stable's record year of $17.8 million in 1988, that bonanza 
year in the Breeders' Cup. By '92, whether he is comfortable admitting it or 
not, Lukas was circling the wagons: His two biggest clients were gone, Gene 
Klein having died and Calumet Farm having gone into bankruptcy while owing 
Lukas more than $2 million in unsecured debts. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were niches not easily filled. In partnership or by himself, Klein raced 
six of Lukas' Breeders' Cup winners, and Klein also owned Lukas' only Kentucky 
Derby winner, Winning Colors. Calumet raced Criminal Type, who won the 
horse-of-the-year title while missing the Breeders' Cup because of an injury in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Lukas has two more high-powered ownership teams -- William T. Young's 
Overbrook Farm in Lexington, Ky., and Robert and Beverly Lewis of Newport Beach 
-- in tow, and they complement one another as perfectly as Calumet and Klein 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, a slight, soft-spoken 76-year-old man who made his money in peanut 
butter, stands five stallions, including Storm Cat, the sire of Tabasco Cat, 
Harlan and Cat Appeal, at his 1,600-acre farm. He races and sells their 
offspring. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Lewis, 70, operates three beer distributorships in California and with 
his wife bought their first horses four years ago. The Lewises, who have no 
desire to breed horses, have been a force at auctions. They own Serena's Song 
outright and are part of a Timber Country partnership that includes Young. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got the best of all worlds now," Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other night, at a dinner in Louisville, Young referred to Wayne Lukas and 
his 36-year-old son, Jeff, as "the best trainers in America." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lukas operation had been reeling enough from a dearth of stakes winners 
when Young's Union City broke down and died in the 1993 Preakness. Then seven 
months later, Tabasco Cat got loose at his Santa Anita barn and ran over Jeff 
Lukas, who was trying to flag him down. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Lukas, his father's chief assistant, survived major head injuries 
and came out of a coma to resume work at Del Mar last summer. At Churchill 
Downs, there has been enough work for both of them.  
</P>
<P>
 In the halcyon years, the Lukases would have 275 horses in training at a time, 
firing shots at stakes races from coast to coast from four divisions. Wayne 
Lukas said this week that number is down to 106, with divisions in California 
and New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Less could turn out to be more; Lukas is battling for a national championship 
again, and through October his horses had earned almost $6 million, putting him 
within about $42,000 of the national leader, Bill Mott. 
</P>
<P>
 Mott could have a big day himself today. His Paradise Creek is the 8-5 
favorite in the $2-million Turf, and he is also starting Dahlia's Dreamer and 
1992 Turf winner Fraise for Madeleine Paulson in the 1 1/2-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
 The only time Tabasco Cat ran at Churchill Downs, he was 6-1 in this year's 
Kentucky Derby, got knocked into another horse at the start and wound up sixth 
as Go For Gin beat him by nine lengths on a sloppy track. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Go For Gin is winless -- the rain stopped when it was his turn to 
run -- and Tabasco Cat has won the Preakness, the Belmont Stakes and the 
Kentucky Cup Classic at Turfway Park. In his other races, he has been second in 
the Jim Dandy, a well-beaten third in Holy Bull's Travers and fourth, 3 1/4 
lengths behind Colonial Affair, in the Jockey Club Gold Cup a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did a bad training job before that last race," Lukas said. "I let him get 
too fresh, and he was hard to handle in the paddock and was rank in the race. 
If I had to do it all over, I would have taken something off his fastball." 
</P>
<P>
 A victory by Tabasco Cat in the Jockey Club and another today might have 
thrust the colt back into horse-of-the-year contention, but now Holy Bull 
appears to have the title locked up, without having to run today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Holy Bull's a brilliant horse, and I like him," Lukas said. "If he wins the 
title, I'll be at the dinner applauding him. But it's a difficult year for the 
horse of the year. Holy Bull didn't win a classic race, he didn't run in the 
Triple Crown races we won -- and now he's not here. If Tabasco Cat wins 
Saturday, it would be unprecedented for a horse to win two legs of the Triple 
Crown and the Classic and still not win some sort of an award." Breeders' Cup 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 There's a good chance that the Breeders' Cup attendance record, set at 
Churchill Downs in 1988 when the crowd was 71,237, will be broken today. . . . 
The weather forecast is looking better, with the temperature expected to reach 
70 degrees. There's a 40% chance of rain during the afternoon, but a stronger 
chance for the rain to come after the races are over. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispute, Heavenly Prize's entrymate in the Distaff, has been scratched because 
of abscessed hoof. . . . Eddie Nahem, Bertrando's co-owner, was unsuccessful in 
getting a trainer's license in California and failed the test for a license in 
Kentucky, according to Bernie Hettel, the chief steward at Churchill Downs. "He 
doesn't have much of a knowledge of Kentucky racing rules, and that cost him," 
Hettel said. "He's a horseman, and he'll pass it eventually." Bertrando's 
trainer will continue to be listed as John Shirreffs, with Nahem calling the 
shots.

GOLF ROUNDUP; LEHMAN LEADS AT KAPALUA

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Lehman shot a four-under-par 69 Friday for a two-round total of 135 and a 
two-stroke lead over defending champion Fred Couples and Bob Gilder in the 
Kapalua International in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Lehman, who had a five-under 66 over the shorter Bay Course in the first 
round, got started on the 7,263-yard Plantation Course with three long birdie 
putts -- two from 40 feet and one from 30 feet. He also birdied No. 8 and 
closed with a 12-foot birdie on the 663-yard 18th. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his performance, Lehman said the wind and rain that swept over the 
island of Maui made it difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't easy out there," he said. "I hit some shots that didn't really come 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilder, who started the day in a six-way tie for sixth, was surprised by his 
67. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hit it terrible on the range," he said, adding that it helped him 
concentrate harder. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharing fourth place at 139 were first-round leader Jim McGovern, who had a 73 
on the Bay Course, Keith Clearwater, Jay Delsing and Barry Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Seickmann shot a three-under-par 69 to take a two-stroke lead over three 
players after two rounds of the $1.9-million Sarazen World Open Championship in 
Braselton, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 Seickmann completed 36 holes in eight-under-par 136, two better than Fred 
Funk, Mark McNulty and Miguel Angel Jimenez in the tournament featuring 
national open champions from around the world the last two years. Jimenez shot 
a 66, McNulty a 67 and Funk a 69. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 South Korea's Ko Woo-soon shot a six-under-par 65 to take a one-shot lead 
after the opening round of the $700,000 Toray Japan Queens Cup tournament in 
Kurimotomachi, Japan, the final LPGA event of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ko, starting from the 10th, had three birdies in her first nine holes. On her 
final nine, she made four birdies against a lone bogey. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Larsen was one shot back in the combined tournament featuring players 
from the Japanese and American LPGA tours.

 Baltimore Oriole owner Peter Angelos, scheduled to meet Ram President John 
Shaw in Los Angeles on Friday, had to postpone his trip "because some business 
came up in Baltimore." Angelos, who wants to purchase a minority interest in 
the Rams and move them to Baltimore, has rescheduled the meeting for next week.

THE NFL / BILL PLASCHKE; IT HASN'T BEEN GOOD YEAR FOR MEN IN STRIPED SHIRTS 
</P>

<P>
 In the zebra business, Jack Fette is the equivalent of a nice warm stall. 
</P>
<P>
 As an NFL line judge for 23 years, Fette survived playoffs, Super Bowls and 
even the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Now retired, he helps younger officials survive. Sitting in his office in Lees 
Summit, Mo., he spends hours each day on the phone with referees, line judges 
and back judges. 
</P>
<P>
 He counsels them on controversial calls, warns them about tricky rules, holds 
their hands as they head toward another turbulent weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 One might say the current state of officiating in the NFL can be directly 
related to the activity on Fette's phone. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he needs to install another line. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Fette says things don't look that different, everyone else agrees it 
has become a war out there. 
</P>
<P>
 Blown calls followed by blown tempers followed by some dumb lineman blowing 
his paycheck on a fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Not since the end of instant replay, it seems, have the seven officials at 
each game been so criticized, so frustrated . . . and so dead wrong: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In one corner of the country last weekend, San Diego Charger Coach Bobby 
Ross was twisting his head and screaming at the referee after a touchdown catch 
by Tony Martin became an incompleted pass because the crew missed his right 
foot brushing the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Sparky Anderson has never argued like that. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the middle of the country, defensive lineman Donald Evans of the New 
York Jets was getting thrown out of a game after screaming at referee Bernie 
Kukar. None other than the esteemed Ronnie Lott claimed that Evans was "pushed" 
by Kukar, exacerbating the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Why was Evans so mad? No reason, really. The Jets were penalized 12 times and 
the Indianapolis Colts not once for the first time since 1976. And an obviously 
poor spot after a fourth-down run cost the Jets a chance at a last-minute 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In a far corner of the country, the New York Giants were stunned by one of 
the worst calls of this or any season. 
</P>
<P>
 In overtime against the Detroit Lions, the Lions' Herman Moore caught a pass 
at the Giants' 33. After getting hit by Jarvis Williams, Moore clearly touched 
the ground with his knee, which should have ended the play. 
</P>
<P>
 But no official blew his whistle and Moore wasn't tackled until he reached the 
seven-yard line. Jason Hanson then kicked a game-winning, 24-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners discussed these plays and others this week while roaming the hallways 
of a Chicago airport hotel during NFL meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody wants to hire the officials full-time, nobody wants a return to instant 
replay in its previous form . . . but everybody agrees something must be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the officiating can be better," said Carl Peterson, general manager 
of the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Which bring us to four letters that could solve everything. 
</P>
<P>
 U - S - F - L . 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson, a former executive in the USFL, says the officiating could be 
improved by stealing a trick from his old league. 
</P>
<P>
 Allow instant replay, but only twice a half for each team, by request of the 
coach, he says. If the call is proven to be wrong, it is overturned. If the 
call is upheld, the team loses a timeout or is assessed a five-yard penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "These will continue to leave the game in the hands of the coaches, but make 
sure important calls are made accurately," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking from the other side of the debate, former official Fette agreed that 
the old USFL system could work. 
</P>
<P>
 "By giving the coaches only a couple of challenges, we wouldn't kill so much 
time, and we wouldn't put all the pressure on the replay official to decide 
what gets reviewed," Fette said. "I think that could work for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be surprised if support for this idea builds at next spring's owners' 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 League bosses who do not want a return to instant replay counter with the 
statistic that in the 113 games played this season, only 27 plays would have 
been reversed. 
</P>
<P>
 Does 27 plays sounds like a lot to anybody else? THE WORST 
</P>
<P>
 In a season during which Jerry Seeman, director of officiating, has already 
phoned at least one team and profusely apologized for his officials, it was 
difficult picking only the five worst calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Forgive us for the dozen or so that we left out. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Allowing a 103-yard punt return by the Rams' Robert Bailey against the New 
Orleans Saints with several dozen players roaming the field. 
</P>
<P>
 To think that the record books will be forever tainted with that play, which 
should have been a touchback because of offsetting penalties for all those men 
on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Allowing the Lions' Moore to run into field-goal range after he had fallen 
to the ground last Sunday. The loss that ensued might keep the Giants from the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 George Young, Giant general manager and co-chairman of the influential rules 
committee, is vehemently against instant replay. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to decrease the probability of human error, but you don't cut 
down on human error by adding more humans," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Allowing Herschel Walker to score on a 38-yard touchdown pass even though 
he had clearly stepped out of bounds before crossing the goal line for the 
Philadelphia Eagles in a game against the Dallas Cowboys on Oct. 16.  
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles lost anyway, but won't they be thankful for those six points during 
playoff tiebreaker computations? 
</P>
<P>
 4. Charging Chris Calloway with a taunting violation late in the New York 
Giants' early October game at New Orleans. The penalty cost the Giants a shot 
at a game-tying touchdown, and led to the first of five consecutive losses. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so Calloway pranced around a bit. That sort of call should never be made 
that late in a close game. When a rule is ambiguous, as this one is, officials 
should opt for fairness first. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Allowing Deion Sanders and Andre Rison to engage in a fistfight without 
throwing a flag. 
</P>
<P>
 That $7,500 fine later assessed each player should have been split seven other 
ways. THE SAJAK DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
 Don't laugh, but at least one influential league observer is planning to 
propose a new way to realign the divisions next year, and every two years after 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 Place the names of each team in a giant bin, mix them up, then pull out the 
names and assign them to different divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Do it on national television in March. Make a big show out of it. Sell plenty 
of advertising. Bring in busloads of fans. Garner reams of media attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The craziest thing about this idea is that it could work. 
</P>
<P>
 You say this messes with the integrity of the current format? What integrity? 
</P>
<P>
 The names of the divisions are already meaningless. When the Rams move, four 
of the five NFC West teams will be in the Central or Eastern time zones. 
</P>
<P>
 You say this messes with competitive balance? We say it increases competitive 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
 What better way to keep Seattle Seahawk fans and players interested than to 
assure them that in two years, they could be in a division with Indianapolis, 
New England, Cincinnati and the New York Jets? 
</P>
<P>
 You laugh. But you watch. POWER STRUGGLE 
</P>
<P>
 Quietly, a dispute has broken out between the two most powerful forces in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
 The combatants: Jerry Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys, and Don Shula, coach 
of the Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue: The reputation of Shula's son, Dave, coach of the Cincinnati 
Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Cowboy Coach Barry Switzer compared the Bengals to Iowa State. He 
was using the analogy to warn his team that an unlikely foe could defeat them. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer certainly didn't mean any offense to Dave Shula. There is more than a 
slight chance that Switzer didn't even know who Dave Shula was. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe he had one of his frequent flashbacks and actually thought the Bengals 
were Iowa State. More than once this year, he has referred to his team as "the 
Sooners." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dave didn't see it that way. He took it personally and after his team had 
nearly upset the Cowboys before losing, 23-20, confronted Switzer at midfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can stick that Iowa State," David told him. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer was initially upset by the remark, but later said that Dave's behavior 
didn't bother him because, "Some of my assistants told me that when David was 
coaching here, he was pretty immature." 
</P>
<P>
 Guess who is mad now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barry doesn't know David and doesn't have a clue what he's talking about," 
Don Shula said of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the same Shula who controls the league's rules committee and who often 
acts like a 31st owner. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jones, a man who pulls more strings in this league than almost anyone but 
the commissioner, is openly backing Switzer.  
</P>
<P>
 "From Barry's perspective, I can understand where he was coming from," Jones 
said. "What he was really saying was that Iowa State used to have a chance to 
beat Oklahoma." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones also complimented Dave Shula during the interview, but the lines have 
been drawn. 
</P>
<P>
 The old money is on Shula. But the smart money is on Jones. PARTING BLAST 
</P>
<P>
 Amid this season's controversies over scoring and injuries and realignment, 
somebody man enough to tackle a real issue has finally been found. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade Phillips, coach of the Denver Broncos, has appealed to the NFL to make 
the San Diego Chargers get rid of their end-zone cannon, the one that has fired 
after every score for the last 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips was scared out his socks by the cannon a couple of weeks ago -- as if 
his Broncos had never before given up a score in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium 
-- and so he complained. 
</P>
<P>
 The league, of course, told Phillips to get lost. So now he's planning 
retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can do it, so can we," he told reporters. "We can have bombs and hand 
grenades and fireworks going off in the end zone. We can have about 10 of them 
blowing up over their heads."  
</P>
<P>
 Said Ron Dixon, president of San Diego Fireworks and owner and operator of the 
cannon: "I can't for the life of me figure out what his problem is. I remember 
in the late '60s or early '70s, a coach named Bum Phillips came in here with 
little Wade running around on his daddy's arm. This should come as no 
revelation to him." QUICK HITTERS 
</P>
<P>
 * THE THROWBACK BOWL, AN EPILOGUE: While many of this nation's football fans 
were gathered around office water coolers Tuesday, recalling the wonders of 
that muddy Monday night game between the Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears, a 
Packer employee was fretting. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Gordon (Red) Batty, the club's equipment manager, all of the 
players' shoes, all of the coach's shoes, all of the footballs and many of the 
Throwback uniforms and pants were ruined in the Soldier Field muck. 
</P>
<P>
 Batty said the game cost the Packers about $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Best $15,000 they'll ever spend, if you ask us. 
</P>
<P>
 * IS THAT LIKE A FEARSOME FOURSOME? When asked to describe the NFL's 
fifth-ranked rushing defense, Reuben Davis of the San Diego Chargers said, 
"We're a bunch of ballroom, brawling brothers." 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW ABOUT THIS QUESTION: WHEN ARE YOU RETIRING FROM COACHING? When asked to 
evaluate his team's performance after last week's 35-15 loss to the San Diego 
Chargers, Seattle Seahawk Coach Tom Flores snapped, "What kind of question is 
that?" 
</P>
<P>
 * DOESN'T ANYBODY JUST BOO ANYMORE? While walking past the Tampa Stadium 
stands after his team's 36-13 loss to the Minnesota Vikings last week, 
Buccaneer Coach Sam Wyche was hit with a flying binoculars case. 
</P>
<P>
 With the binoculars inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Another fan, apparently angry at both the coach and the weather, pelted Wyche 
with his rain slicker. 
</P>
<P>
 * SO THERE: For all you coaches who have complained that the new kickoff rule 
gives the receiving team an unfair advantage during overtime -- Wade Phillips, 
are you listening? -- check out this stat: 
</P>
<P>
 In only three of eight overtime games has the team touching the ball first 
scored on that possession. And those three possessions started on the offense's 
22, 23 and 29-yard lines. 
</P>
<P>
 * SAY IT AIN'T SO: As part of the city of San Francisco's $26-million 
renovation of Candlestick Park for the 1999 Super Bowl, officials may sell the 
name "Candlestick" to a big corporation, which could then attach its own name 
to the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 And you thought Midwesterners were mad when Indianapolis' Hoosier Dome became 
the RCA Dome. 
</P>
<P>
 * HONESTY, IT'S SUCH A LOVELY WORD: There is a reason Houston Oiler officials 
try to shield owner Bud Adams from the media. That became clear in the lobby of 
a Chicago airport hotel last week during the NFL owners' meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams needed only a few sentences to pull the rug from under his team, which 
is struggling with a 1-7 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams on his coaching staff: "I will make changes if the players start to lose 
confidence and give up. I'm going to blame the staff for that, and I will think 
about doing something. You can't sit around and let that continue." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams on his offense: "I just don't think the run-and-shoot offense works 
anymore. Teams are able to defense it now. They have figured out what to do 
against it. There's no secret to what we are doing. We can't do the same things 
we did in the past. We don't have the personnel to run it." 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Cody Carlson later told reporters: "I have a problem with the way 
it was handled. To put the blame on one or two individuals is not right and 
it's not fair. (It) sounded to me like (Adams is) throwing in the towel." 
</P>
<P>
 Added assistant coach Kevin Gilbride: "He signs the checks, so he can say what 
he wants to say, but that doesn't mean he's right." 
</P>
<P>
 Good night, Jack Pardee. Good night, Kevin. Good night, Cody. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, new coach Jeff Fisher will have his hands full.

<P>
 The Rams delivered the ultimate insult to Tim Lester on Friday when they 
listed the uninjured running back inactive for Sunday's game against the Denver 
Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 Lester, who received a free trip to last year's Pro Bowl (compliments of 
Jerome Bettis) for his superior blocking performance, was informed without 
explanation that he wouldn't be needed this week. In addition to losing his 
starting fullback duties to Howard Griffith, Lester learned this week that he 
would no longer be included on the kickoff coverage team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea what's happening; I was surprised," Lester said. "I guess 
they're trying to say I was the problem or something. I don't see a difference 
now really from last year. I haven't forgotten how to block or anything. It's 
tougher this year because teams know we're running all the time, but my 
blocking's the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox offered no explanation for Lester's demotion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams also listed injured center Bern Brostek, tackle Ronald Edwards and 
running back James Bostic as inactive.

</P>
<P>
 Starting right guard Leo Goeas sat out practice for a second consecutive day 
because of an abdominal muscle strain and tackle Darryl Ashmore may start in 
his place. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my first time playing guard -- ever," Ashmore said, who filled in for 
a few plays against the Atlanta Falcons this season. "Each day I've been 
getting more used to it, so I feel more comfortable. I know the plays because 
of having to know what the guy next to me has to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Ashmore started the season at right tackle, but suffered a knee injury. He 
said he could not have played the entire game against New Orleans two weeks 
ago, but is ready to go the whole way now if needed. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Rams are expected to promote guard/center Brad Fichtel from the practice 
squad to the 53-man roster to replace wide receiver Richard Buchanan 
(hamstring) and provide additional offensive line insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Tackle Jackie Slater said he will be available for emergency duty, but he said 
he is still not 100% and is not sure how long his injured triceps will hold up.

 After a shaky start, the defensive line play has been a strong point for the 
Raiders as they have climbed from 12th in the AFC against the run (156 yards 
after Week 1) to fourth (99.8 yards per game). 
</P>
<P>
 One reason has been Nolan Harrison, who has split time at defensive end and 
tackle. Harrison, a fourth-year veteran from Indiana, is having his best season 
with 23 tackles, including three sacks, two pass deflections, two fumble 
recoveries and one forced fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing about Nolan is that he is going to give you everything he has on 
every play," Coach Art Shell said. "He might make some mistakes, but he is like 
a bull in a china closet in that he makes things happen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another area of improvement for the Raiders has been forced turnovers. 
Throughout last season, the Raiders forced 23, but after only eight games this 
year, they have forced 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put a lot of emphasis in training camp about creating turnovers," Shell 
said. "But things like turnovers come in cycles. Sometimes you get them and 
sometimes you don't." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive tackle Jerry Ball did not practice this week because of a knee 
injury but is expected to play Sunday against the Kansas City Chiefs. If he 
can't play, Scott Davis will start at defensive end, with Harrison moving back 
inside to defensive tackle. . . . Safety Eddie Anderson, who did not play last 
week against Houston, practiced this week and will start against the Chiefs. . 
. . Punter Jeff Gossett leads the AFC with a 44.4 average. . . . Kansas City 
Coach Marty Schottenheimer has a 10-4 record against the Raiders and a victory 
Sunday would be his 100th in the regular season. . . . The Chiefs have won 
eight of their last nine games against the Raiders, including a two-game sweep 
last season. LONNIE WHITE

 Bill Parcells, coach of the New England Patriots, was released from a hospital 
when tests showed he was in good health after experiencing lightheadedness. 
</P>
<P>
 Parcells, who has a history of heart problems, spent Thursday night at 
Massachusetts General Hospital.Parcells underwent "a series of vigorous 
exercise tests" and the results "looked excellent," Patriot cardiologist Adolph 
Hutter said.

 Team owner Bob Kraft said Parcells will coach Sunday when the Patriots play at 
Cleveland.

 Cincinnati Bengal linebacker James Francis said he will fly to New York on 
Tuesday to appeal the NFL's decision to fine him $12,500 for his hit Sunday on 
Dallas Cowboy quarterback Troy Aikman. Francis said he had no intention of 
hurting Aikman with the forearm to the head. He said Dallas offensive lineman 
Mark Tuinei pushed him into Aikman and that he avoided the block with his arm 
high. "That's a chunk of money," Francis said of the fine. "Some people don't 
make that in a year and I've got to pay it for something I didn't do. If I 
wanted to take a swing at him, I could have. I'm not a dirty player." . . . . 
The Pittsburgh Steelers deactivated running back Barry Foster for Sunday's game 
at Houston.

 The handwriting was on the wall for Ossie Ardiles, Argentina's World 
Cup-winning midfielder of 1978 who was fired this week as coach of the English 
Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur. 
</P>
<P>
 As loss followed loss, Spurs' fans discovered that if they rearranged the 
letters in Ardiles' name they could sum up his team pretty well.

 After finishing his playing career, Dunga, Brazil's World Cup '94 captain, 
says he wants to open a zoo.

</P>
<P>
 Another member of Brazil's victorious team is following a somewhat higher 
calling. 
</P>
<P>
 Goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel, who all but dropped from sight after his 
penalty-saving heroics helped the Brazilians win the World Cup, has resurfaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to land a job with another team after being released by his Italian 
club, Reggiana, Taffarel, a deeply religious man, now plays free for a church 
team in the town of Reggio nell'Emilia. 
</P>
<P>
 He even scored a goal in a recent game.

 "He believes God protected him and the Brazilian team during the World Cup," 
said the parish priest, Don Luigi Gianferrari.

 The only country certain to be playing in the 1996 European Championship is 
England, the host nation for the 16-team tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 So, while 47 other countries are battling to make the field, England is left 
with nothing but "friendly" games between now and June 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Terry Venables is making sure his team will be well tested by then, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
 Unbeaten in the first five games of Venables' reign, England has defeated 
European champion Denmark, 1-0; tied Norway, 0-0; trounced Greece, 5-0; beaten 
the United States, 2-0, and tied Romania, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the schedule gets decidedly more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 England plays Nigeria this month and Portugal in March. Then, next June, it 
plays in a tournament with Brazil, Sweden and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 If Venables' team still is undefeated after that, it will have to be 
considered a legitimate candidate to win its first European Championship.

 Bulgarian striker Hristo Stoitchkov, who played superbly in helping Barcelona 
thrash England's Manchester United, 4-0, on Wednesday in the European 
Champions' League, has been a key figure in the Spanish champion's four 
consecutive league titles. 
</P>
<P>
 But there has been a price. 
</P>
<P>
 When Stoitchkov was tossed out of a Spanish Cup game this season, it was was 
his 11th red card in four years. Referees have also given him 36 yellow cards 
in that time.

 The Nigerian team apparently enjoyed its World Cup experience in the United 
States a little more than most of the media realized. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemens Westerhof, the Dutch coach who led the Nigerians to within a whisker 
of the quarterfinals, said he knew his team was doomed to defeat against Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview in the current issue of African Soccer, Westerhof tells the 
following tale: 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the match against Italy, I saw that the players had lost 
concentration, so I suggested that we move to another hotel. Some of them had 
their wives with them, and some other ladies came. One night, six players were 
out until 6 a.m. The team discipline was slipping away. 
</P>
<P>
 "They refused to move. From that moment we had lost. We didn't lose the match 
on the pitch, we'd already lost it."

 When Liverpool of the English Premier League made a preseason tour of South

president decked out in a Liverpool jersey and scarf.

 When Diego Maradona, suspended for a second 15-month spell after failing a 
World Cup drug test, assumed assistant coaching duties at Argentina's Deportivo 
Mandiyu club, he said, "I will give my players an injection of strength, morale 
and the will to play good soccer."

he gives them . . . "

 Bayern Munich won the Bundesliga championship in Germany last season under the 
temporary coaching of Franz Beckenbauer, then hired Italy's Giovanni Trapattoni 
as its new coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Trapattoni, who enjoyed great success at Juventus and Inter Milan, did not get 
off to an especially promising start in Germany. Nor did he win many friends 
with the following comment: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Germans historically have an idea of domination in their heads which I 
don't personally share but which has certainly always caused a lot of 
problems," he told Italy's Corriere Dello Sport. "It's time to review the 
idea."

 A television network in Argentina has a novel way of showing its feelings

with dark glasses, white cane and guide dog.

 One proposal is for a lengthy series that would be played in Canadian and

However, a spokesman for the NHLPA said it would not commit to anything until 
it sees whether the first tournament, to be held Nov. 10-12 at Hamilton, 
Canada, is a success.

CHAPMAN HOPES HISTORY REPEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The last team unlucky enough to run into Chapman after a loss was Menlo. The 
result: Panthers 62, Menlo 0. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight at 7, Pomona-Pitzer will meet the Panthers at Chapman and it could be 
more of the same. Pomona-Pitzer has lost its last six after winning its first 
game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Sagehens lost to Cal Lutheran, 17-16, when they missed a 
36-yard field-goal attempt with seven seconds remaining. Pomona had led, 16-3, 
with 9 minutes 53 second left before Cal Lutheran rallied. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman Coach Ken Visser said the Sagehens have a strong team but are hampered 
because they have a roster of fewer than 40 players. 
</P>
<P>
 "They play with a lot of courage, but sometimes they just run out of bodies," 
Visser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman (4-2-1) lost to La Verne, 36-33, last Saturday, but Visser said it 
wasn't as frustrating as the Panthers' first loss of the season, 30-20 to 
Occidental Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "Against Occidental," Visser said, "we just didn't show up the same way we 
usually show up. We all felt we didn't play with the same intensity we usually 
play with and we learned something from that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers put their learning into practice against Menlo, a vastly 
overmatched team that was playing without three defensive starters because of 
disciplinary reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Visser said his team regained its intensity against Menlo and maintained it 
against La Verne, ranked third in the NCAA Division III West Region. 
</P>
<P>
 That could spell trouble for the Sagehens. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight is Chapman's homecoming and final home game of the season. The 
Panthers will finish their season next Saturday at Cal Lutheran. . . . Darnell 
Rubin, one of Chapman's most dangerous offensive weapons, has been ruled 
academically ineligible for the final two games. Rubin, a junior from Los 
Angeles Westchester High and Rio Hondo College, started the season as a 
receiver and kick and punt returner and played some tailback in the last few 
games. He scored on an 85-yard run -- the Panthers longest of the season -- 
against Menlo. He averaged 14.8 yards per carry and 20.3 yards per catch. He is 
ranked fifth in the nation in kickoff return average (30 yards per return) and 
seventh in punt returns (14.3). . . . Roger Caron, Pomona-Pitzer's first-year 
coach, was a fifth-round draft pick of the Indianapolis Colts in 1985. He was 
an offensive lineman at Harvard.

DIVISION LEADERS WARM UP FOR SHOWDOWN

<P>
 The key today for Rancho Santiago and Fullerton, the co-leaders of the Mission 
Conference Central Division, is don't get caught looking ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams meet Nov. 12 at Cal State Fullerton in a game that could decide the 
division title and a berth in the Simple Green Orange County Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the matchup to remain important, the teams must win today. Both play 
teams that have been struggling all season. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's Mission Conference Central Division games: 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (4-2-1, 3-0) at Orange Coast (1-6, 1-2), 1:30 p.m. -- Fullerton 
leads the all-time series, 25-16-3, but Orange Coast has won three of the last 
four, including a 38-16 victory last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's defense appears to be improving each week. The Hornets are third 
overall in the conference, giving up 356 yards per game. Linebackers Chris 
Garza (36 solo tackles) and Jason Nevadomsky (32 solo tackles) lead the unit. 
Defensive back Peter Burton has 10 pass deflections. Punter Jim Wren is 
averaging a conference-best 40.9 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton is coming off a 35-14 victory over Golden West that Coach Gene 
Murphy said is the best his team has played in his two seasons at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast broke a six-game losing streak with a 42-38 victory over 
Southwestern last Saturday. Jeff Clayton, a sophomore running back, leads 
Orange County rushers with 803 yards. He also has 2,245 yards in his career and 
is the seventh player to gain more than 2,000 yards in Orange County community 
college history. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwestern (0-6-1, 0-3-1) vs. Rancho Santiago (6-1, 3-0), Santa Ana Stadium, 
1:30 p.m. -- Rancho Santiago has won six in a row and the players seem to be 
growing more confident each week. The Dons are ranked second in Southern 
California behind El Camino, which beat the Dons, 55-28, in the season-opener. 
Rancho Santiago is eighth in the J.C. Grid-Wire national rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons lean toward the run, averaging 239 yards per game. But quarterback 
Simon Fuentes has been impressive when called upon. He has completed 77 of 118 
passes with 13 touchdowns and four interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Wilson has rushed for 549 yards and seven touchdowns and Kevin Pola, a 
converted linebacker, has gained 357 yards and scored six touchdowns. Rancho 
Santiago will be without wide receiver Hector Flores, who was ejected in the 
victory over Pasadena and must sit out this week under conference rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwestern is last in the State in defense, giving up 43 points and 474 
yards per game. Rancho Santiago's defense is ranked No. 1 against the rush (114 
yards) and fourth overall (364) in conference.

 Saddleback (1-5-1, 1-1-1) vs. Golden West (2-5-1, 2-2), Orange Coast, 7 p.m. 
-- Saddleback is coming off its first victory, a 25-23 victory over Riverside. 
Saddleback, normally an offensive power, is last in the conference at 299 yards 
per game. The Gauchos have scored 17 touchdowns, 20 fewer than 
conference-leader El Camino. Golden West, despite losing three tailbacks to 
injuries, is fourth in the conference in rushing at 188 yards per game.

MCCUTCHEON LEADS AMAT, 28-6; PREPS: SON OF FORMER RAM GREAT GETS 260 TOTAL 
YARDS IN VICTORY OVER CRESPI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The team is ranked No. 1 in the nation. Maybe the tailback should be, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Daylon McCutcheon, whose father, Lawrence, played running back for the 
Rams, appeared every bit the Division I prospect he is proclaimed to be as 
Bishop Amat High trounced Crespi, 28-6, in a Del Rey League game Friday night 
at Bishop Amat. 
</P>
<P>
 McCutcheon rushed for three touchdowns and caught a touchdown pass while 
piling up 260 total yards. He rushed for 189 yards in 19 carries, including 
scoring runs of 12, 76 and seven yards. He caught two passes for 71 yards, 
including a 43-yard touchdown pass play. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Amat (9-0, 4-0 in league play), ranked No. 1 nationally by at least one 
publication, did the rest with defense, checking Crespi's emotion-filled 
offensive drives and sacking Celt quarterback Dave Lins right out of his shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory assured Bishop Amat of at least a share of the league title. 
Crespi (5-4, 3-1) remains in second place. 
</P>
<P>
 Lins fared well, considering the savage pass rush he faced. He completed 21 of 
39 for 158 yards. But he was sacked six times for minus-44 yards and emerged 
from one pileup doubled over in pain and his shoe untied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bit my tongue, I chipped my tooth," Lins said. "But that's football. 
They're a great team. I mean, No. 1 in the nation. And that tailback is 
awesome." 
</P>
<P>
 There is little doubt that McCutcheon (5 feet 11, 185 pounds) is headed 
somewhere after high school. Every time he touched the ball he was in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 He opened the scoring with a 12-yard run on his second carry.  
</P>
<P>
 Six minutes later, he caught a swing pass from quarterback James Free and was 
off and running again, going 43 yards for a score that gave the Lancers a 14-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the second quarter, McCutcheon made an interception in the end zone. 
Four plays later, he took a handoff and ran 76 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Jamian Barbour was a bright spot for Crespi, rushing for 121 yards in 
13 carries, including a 42-yard burst for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're a great football team," Crespi Coach Tim Lins said. "They 
didn't do anything we didn't expect. My goodness, I think we did pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Jeff DeFinney led Crespi with nine catches for 56 yards. Wayne 
Emerson added six receptions for 39 yards, and Marcos Solorzano had five for 47 
yards.

ESPERANZA TRIPS MARINA, 20-13 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Marina High's defense did a solid job of containing Esperanza standout running 
back Dahrin Footman but couldn't stop him, and that was the difference as the 
Aztecs won, 20-13, in a Sunset League game Friday at Westminster High. 
</P>
<P>
 Footman, a senior, finished with 180 yards in 33 carries but only had two runs 
for more than 10 yards. Marina, obviously helped by a strong scouting report, 
played as many as nine players on the line of scrimmage at times. 
</P>
<P>
 Footman was at his best when Esperanza needed to run out the final 2 minutes 
59 seconds. He carried six consecutive times for 33 yards and two first downs, 
preventing Marina from getting another chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to the (Marina) coach, they knew when we were going to run and when 
we were going to pass," said Footman, who has rushed for 1,554 yards this 
season. "They played us pretty hard and got a few good hits in on me." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory assures Esperanza (6-3, 3-1 in league) of a playoff berth. The 
Aztecs also remain in second place, a game behind Los Alamitos, the top-ranked 
team in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza was coming off a 35-32 loss to Los Alamitos last week, and Coach 
Gary Meek wasn't sure how his players would respond against Marina. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty uninspired but we got the win," he said. "We came out pretty 
flat and Marina played us hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza's defense was especially hard on Marina quarterback Matt Roberson, 
who completed five of 21 passes for 113 yards. He did have two passes dropped 
in a streak of 11 consecutive misses. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberson completed a 28-yard scoring pass to Aron Bergman with 2:59 left in 
the game, but Esperanza turned to Footman and ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Footman started the scoring with an eight-yard run at the 11:53 mark of the 
second quarter. The Aztecs led, 7-0, at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza went up, 14-0, when quarterback Chris Stretch scored on a two-yard 
run on fourth down with 9:54 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina (6-3, 1-3) finally scored when Mike Williams reached the end zone from 
one yard with 1:13 left in the third quarter. The touchdown was set up by a 
58-yard pass from Roberson to Bergman, who was tackled at the Esperanza 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza scored again when Stretch went six yards around end with 10:27 left 
in the game.  
</P>
<P>
 The drive had appeared to be stopped when Footman was tackled short of a first 
down near midfield, but Marina was called for a face-mask penalty to give 
Esperanza a first down.

ELECTIONS: PROP. 187: THE ANGER AND ANGST; STUDENT WALKOUT INQUIRY IS URGED; 
PROTESTS: INITIATIVE BACKERS SAY SCHOOL OFFICIALS ENCOURAGED YOUTHS TO LEAVE 
CLASSES. ADMINISTRATORS DENY CHARGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Backers of Proposition 187 accused school officials Friday of encouraging 
thousands of students to walk out of class in recent weeks, while opponents of 
the measure said its passage would throw hundreds of thousands more out of 
school permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 In a last-chance appeal for voters to defeat the controversial initiative, Los 
Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block and top prosecutors from Los Angeles and 
San Francisco charged that barring up to 400,000 undocumented students from 
school -- as the measure calls for -- would result in a substantial crime 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is that crime prevention means keeping kids in school," Los Angeles 
County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said at a news conference. "The law enforcement 
community is standing shoulder to shoulder saying, 'For us as professionals, 
Proposition 187 is not the way to go.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, sponsors of the ballot measure held their own news conference 
Friday morning outside Los Angeles Unified School District headquarters, urging 
that Garcetti investigate allegations that teachers and administrators 
encouraged and in some cases assisted angry students to plan and execute the 
walkouts. 
</P>
<P>
 To support their claims, they quoted a news report of Granada Hills High 
School teachers helping map a march route earlier this week. They also 
distributed letters from the Long Beach and Los Angeles unified school 
districts advising parents about possible consequences of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are outraged and we believe that taxpayers should be outraged that dollars 
for education . . . seem to be being channeled into a political campaign," said 
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach), a major backer of the proposition. 
"We are also upset that teachers and administrators seem to be inciting the 
students to go out into the streets to ditch classes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Garcetti said the district attorney's office had not 
received a formal request to investigate the alleged school misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles unified officials defended the mailing of letters to parents, 
saying they were providing only factual information. They also said they would 
look into specific reports of teachers or administrators getting involved in 
walkouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those people will be disciplined should those allegations prove true," Board 
of Education President Mark Slavkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills High School Principal Kathleen Rattay said reports of teacher 
participation in a march Wednesday were grossly distorted. She and other school 
officials advised the 300 students only how to safely conduct their march -- 
remaining on sidewalks and obeying traffic lights -- after spending more than 
two hours trying to dissuade them from leaving the campus, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We asked them to plan safely and they ran a few things by us," Rattay said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, a parent leader said the Parent Teacher Student Assn. has received 
no complaints of official complicity in the walkouts, the kind of concern that 
would ordinarily stir up the group's members. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although we are opposed to Proposition 187, if we had any information that 
administrators were encouraging or behind the student walkouts, we'd be down at 
the Board of Administration protesting also," said Harriet Sculley, who heads 
the PTSA in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Scattered walkouts continued Friday, with more than 3,500 students leaving 
schools around the county. About 500 South-Central Los Angeles high school 
students gathered at Exposition Park in the morning. Three people were arrested 
there -- two on charges of battery on an officer and one on charges of 
vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley, about 250 Taft High School students walked from 
their Woodland Hills campus to Cleveland High School in Reseda, where they were 
briefly joined by another 250 demonstrators. The protest ended peacefully when 
the Taft youths boarded buses bound for their home campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Calm also governed a protest involving 300 students who trekked from Glendale 
High and Roosevelt Middle schools to the steps of Glendale City Hall -- which 
was empty because it is closed on alternate Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
 Around noon, what began as a peaceful demonstration by about 200 Gardena High 
School students turned into a racial standoff and fistfight among African 
American and Latino students from Gardena and Leuzinger high schools. Sheriff's 
officials made about a dozen arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting on the continued walkouts, Los Angeles Unified School Board Member 
Leticia Quezada said she thought the public had "underestimated the fear that 
the proposition was going to incite among young people. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have this simplistic reaction that 'Why isn't the school stopping 
them?' " she said. "Some of these things aren't stoppable." 
</P>
<P>
 At their morning news conference, Garcetti, Block, Los Angeles City Atty. 
James Hahn and San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith asked voters to vote no on 
Proposition 187 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please dig down deep inside," Garcetti said. "The reason the (proponents of 
the measure) want the case to go to the United States Supreme Court is because 
they're hoping that the court will change the law. If that happens, are you 
going to feel good?" 
</P>
<P>
 Block agreed that passage of the measure would have a large impact on 
youngsters and crime. "Not only will many of them get into mischief," said 
Block, who was one of the first public figures to come out against the measure, 
"but many of them will become victims of crime."  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to barring illegal immigrant children from public school and 
non-emergency health care, the measure calls for educators and public health 
administrators to report suspects to federal authorities. In this manner, the 
measure's supporters say, illegal immigrants can be deported. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Block raised questions about the likelihood of such deportations -- 
considering that federal authorities already have trouble keeping up with 
deportation cases at the County Jail alone. 
</P>
<P>
 If Proposition 187 is approved, the federal Immigration and Naturalization 
Service would be hard-pressed to begin checking the long lists of suspects 
that, according to the measure, it would begin receiving from hospitals, 
clinics and schools, said INS spokesman Richard Kenney. 
</P>
<P>
 Block also said that the student walkouts "are really undercutting" the 
efforts to defeat the measure: "The critical voter base is going to be those 
who are yet undecided and they can be pushed in either direction." 
</P>
<P>
 In a printed statement, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony joined those opposing the 
walkouts, commending students for "their passionate interest in this election," 
but asking them to work against Proposition 187 after school. Los Angeles 
County Supervisor Gloria Molina, in a noontime appearance at Montebello High 
School, also implored students not to leave school next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the walkouts began a month ago, Los Angeles Unified administrators have 
publicly asked students to remain at school, but they also made it easy for 
them to return if they chose to leave. Administrators and teachers have walked 
with students, sometimes providing bullhorns; school buses have been provided 
to return protesters to school, and few students have been disciplined for 
leaving campus. 
</P>
<P>
 After Taft students had returned to their campus Friday, Principal Ron Berz 
discussed the fine line school officials must walk as they try to encourage 
free expression without appearing to take sides, and keep marchers safe without 
provoking even more demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been more basic obstacles, too, Berz said. Only a third of Taft's 
32-acre campus is fenced in, yet the school on busy Ventura Boulevard has 27 
entrances and exits, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 And physically restraining otherwise peaceful demonstrators has been out of 
the question because of the potential for injury, for escalating confrontations 
with authorities, and because of the size of Taft's student body, 3,000 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the logistics to keep them inside," said Berz. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Laura Chick, who represents the southwestern San Fernando Valley, 
called Friday for teachers and administrators to "enforce consequences" on 
truant students, such as putting students in detention or notifying their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not tolerant of children being out of school unless they are sick or 
have some other appropriate reason," Chick said. 
</P>
<P>
 University High School did just that, assigning six hours of detention to more 
than 700 students who skipped two classes to demonstrate at the Federal 
Building in Westwood on Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Districtwide, however, most schools have followed the district's policy to 
punish only those who do not return to school after the march or who cause 
problems, such as vandalism, while off campus.

SOKA, AGENCY REACH TENTATIVE SITE AGREEMENT; SANTA MONICAS: IF OKD, THE 
CONSERVANCY WOULD ACQUIRE NEARLY 200 ACRES OF SCHOOL PROPERTY. THE UNIVERSITY, 
IN TURN, WOULD AGREE TO SCALE BACK ITS DEVELOPMENT PLANS. 
</P>

<P>
 After two bitter years of fighting each other in court, the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy and Soka University are sitting down to negotiate the 
fate of the school's scenic Calabasas campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a tentative agreement outlined Friday, the conservancy would acquire 
nearly 200 acres of Soka's campus at Las Virgenes Road and Mulholland Highway 
-- land long coveted by parks agencies as a visitors center for the Santa 
Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Soka would agree to scale back its plans to develop a 
liberal arts college on other property it owns adjacent to the historic King 
Gillette Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the agreement would settle the conservancy's ongoing eminent 
domain lawsuit against the school, potentially saving both sides millions of 
dollars in legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Negotiation is always desirable to going to war," said Jerry Daniel, 
president of the conservancy's board. Daniel and others on both sides refused 
to discuss details of the proposed settlement -- including exact acreage, how 
much the land might cost and when the transfer might occur. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not at liberty to discuss details," Soka spokesman Jeff Ourvan said. "The 
general parameters are the desire to save the taxpayer millions of dollars, the 
protection of the majority of Gillette Ranch as permanent open space and the 
establishment of a small university on the site." 
</P>
<P>
 Any deal would have to be approved not only by Soka trustees and conservancy 
directors, but by the board of another parks agency and finally by the judge in 
the current lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy board is scheduled to consider the agreement Monday night at 
its meeting in Rosemead. Conservancy Executive Director Joseph T. Edmiston said 
any agreements would be released later this month for public comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, however, word of a proposed deal has swept through the Santa Monica 
Mountains, where homeowners and environmentalists have long complained that 
Soka's plans to build a university are inappropriate for the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Most denounced the idea of settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not something where you can cut the baby in half," Calabasas Planning 
Commissioner Dave Brown said. "What we end up with is a tremendous amount of 
environmental damage." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Les Hardie, past president of the Las Virgenes Homeowners Federation, said, 
"It stinks. I think it would destroy the conservancy as an institution that has 
any credibility whatsoever in the environmental community and among people who 
care about the mountains." 
</P>
<P>
 Other groups, including the Angeles chapter of the Sierra Club and the 
Coalition to Preserve Las Virgenes, also condemned the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy has been trying to seize 245 of Soka's 660 acres through 
eminent domain. The land, which includes a mansion and grounds built by razor 
magnate King Gillette, is adjacent to Malibu Creek State Park and one of the 
few large flat areas in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka, on the other hand, wants to expand its small language school of about 
200 students into a full-scale liberal arts college. Since 1991, it has offered 
to share the site with parks agencies, which refused. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, Edmiston said, the idea of sharing the property with Soka is 
unacceptable. "Joint use is not on the table," he said. Sources said the 
proposed deal requires Soka to give up entirely its claim to the Gillette Ranch 
portion of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 But Soka would be allowed to seek permission for a scaled-down development on 
its adjacent 400 acres to the east. Even if the conservancy continues its 
eminent domain action and ultimately wins, Soka still would retain that right. 
</P>
<P>
 Any development on the site would be considered by the Los Angeles County 
Board of Supervisors. Edmiston said settling with Soka would not lessen the 
conservancy's concern over the environmental effects of a larger university. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an endorsement," he said. "I would assume that we would have full 
right to comment on their project. The only thing this deals with is the legal 
aspect of it." 
</P>
<P>
 But some remained unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), who authored the 1978 
legislation that created the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area, said the 
proposal would ruin the area. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There is absolutely no way that having a large campus right in the heart of 
the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area will benefit the park," he 
wrote to conservancy President Daniel on Friday. "The natural resources and the 
beauty of the area would be ruined by such intensive use of that site." 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy officials and board members declined to discuss why they sat down 
to negotiate with Soka after so much time and money has been invested in the 
legal fight. Later this month, the conservancy and Soka were scheduled to face 
off in court for one of the final arguments in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka attorney Hodge Dolle said the conservancy may be feeling the pinch of 
mounting legal bills. Since a parks bond measure failed last summer, the 
conservancy has been squeezed for cash to acquire new properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolle also said that if Edmiston loses the eminent domain case -- the first 
ever launched by the conservancy -- the defeat could undermine the 
conservancy's efforts to cobble together other mountain parcels for parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the conservancy would lose a lot of credibility," Dolle said. "If he 
(Edmiston) is viewed as a crippled condemner, then that's like having a 
toothless bulldog bite you. I think that's what's at stake here."

CLOSED FOR THE DURATION; DAMAGE: NEARLY 10 MONTHS AFTER THE TEMBLOR, A 
SHATTERED RESIDENCE TOPPLES DOWN A HILLSIDE. CAUSE IS UNKNOWN.

 One neighbor thought it was an earthquake. Another ran outside to see a rising 
cloud of dust. And when Elizabeth Zagarino finally looked down upon it Friday 
afternoon, she decided not to buy a home in this neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Scattered more than one hundred feet beneath Zagarino's feet were the remains 
of 3761 Glenridge Drive, a three-story townhome that inexplicably toppled down 
a hillside Friday after being red-tagged as uninhabitable for months following 
the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to tell you that this little neighbor here is causing extreme problems 
for the people up the hill trying to sell their homes," said Zagarino, 26, of 
Studio City, who was out shopping for hillside homes with her realtor when they 
stumbled upon the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident, which occurred about 1 p.m., involved the first 
earthquake-damaged house to collapse since last March's aftershocks, according 
to Los Angeles City Building and Safety Inspector Frank Bush, who visited the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea what caused it to collapse," said Bush, looking at the tilted 
wooden garage entry and yellow warning tape, the only remnants of the house 
left standing on the hillside. 
</P>
<P>
 But he did not rule out weather-related causes. "It could have been the rain 
or the wind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Bush, the owner of the empty, 4,000-square-foot house was 
planning earthquake repairs to the foundation. Bush said the owner had been 
granted an extension to complete the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The reputed owner could not be reached for comment Friday. But neighbors had 
plenty to say about the downed townhome.

<P>
 "I'm glad it's gone, but I'm sad for the owner," said Bob Brown, 50, who lives 
across the street. "This hill just can't support that kind of building." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many neighbors, Brown believed the home should never have been built at 
the location in 1987. Two other homes on Glenridge Drive were eventually torn 
down after the quake, he said, and city work crews have recently shored up the 
crack-lined side of the street where the home collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush said no other homes in the area are in immediate danger from the 
collapsed structure. He hoped to have an explanation for the collapse in the 
future, but could not speculate on whether there might be other quake-damaged 
hillside homes that could be collapse in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 A grove of walnut trees blocked the townhome, which crumpled into slabs of 
wood, concrete and insulation, from sliding into another house below, on 
Benedict Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of that home, Fran Schrager, has not lived there since last spring, 
but had dropped by the house shortly after the incident with her children to 
pick up some ski jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some lady just drove up by our house and said, 'How's your back door?' " said 
Schrager, who loaded her children into the car and raced up the hill to view 
the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking down the hillside, the family spotted a yellow recycling bin among the 
rubble, prompting Schrager to wonder aloud who would clean up the destruction 
encroaching upon their back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Her son, 10-year-old Alec, suggested that the owner of the disintegrated house 
"get his little toothbrush and clean this up."

ELECTIONS / WATER BOARD; CAMPAIGN SPOTLIGHTS COSTLY WATER PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When the price tag for the road leading up to the Rio Vista Water Treatment 
Plant above the Santa Clarita Valley reached a million dollars, local critics 
of the Castaic Lake Water Agency were hardly surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, they grumbled, it seemed fitting that the Taj Mahal -- as they like 
to call the new plant -- had a grand entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 By water treatment plant standards, the 30-million-gallon-a-day Rio Vista 
facility is top of the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Its science -- using ozone instead of chlorine to purify water -- is state of 
the art. Its architecture -- Spanish-style tile roofs overhead and Mexican 
paver tiles underfoot -- lends the place the air of a Mediterranean villa. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant, really a hilltop complex, certainly sports some Cadillac touches: 
golden oak paneling in the board room, panoramic views from the control room, a 
million-dollar water conservation garden. 
</P>
<P>
 But the luxuries come at a steep price. On top of the hefty $132-million cost, 
there is deep division in the community over who should pay for the plant and 
other steps the water agency is taking to prepare the burgeoning Santa Clarita 
Valley for another growth spurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is, who's going to pick up the tab for this?" said Allan 
Cameron, an outspoken critic of the Castaic Lake Water Agency and its new 
"palatial" offices. "This thing is a massive expenditure of public money," he 
said. "If the voters are going to be on the hook for this, they should have a 
chance to say no." 
</P>
<P>
 That's precisely the message that Cameron and others hope to get across in 
Tuesday's election, which is largely seen as a referendum on the water 
establishment. Four challengers are going up against three incumbents in a 
virtually unheard-of united campaign spotlighting the high cost of the Rio 
Vista plant, charges of conflicts of interests and the alleged spendthrift ways 
of the water agency. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth incumbent bowed out early, declining to run because, he said, it 
wasn't worth the grief. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have people criticize you day after day when they don't know what the hell 
they're talking about, it's unbearable," said Stephen J. McLean, a Metropolitan 
Water District engineer who ruled out a reelection bid. "And then, to have them 
cast themselves as the voice of the community and watchdogs of the agency is 
ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mix in some volatile arguments over growth -- and even emotional charges of a 
"Chinatown"-type collusion between the water agency and developers -- and the 
result is a pretty spirited election season in a normally sleepy contest for 
seats on the local water board. 
</P>
<P>
 Running for reelection are Mary Spring, 67, a mediator and water board 
president; Richard Green, 44, a nursery owner; and Don Froelich, 53, manager of 
the Glendale Water Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The four would-be reformers are Randall Pfiester, 43, a research scientist; 
Michael Kotch, 44, an engineer; Paul Belli, 43, a business manager; and Jack 
Woodrow, 65, a retired marketing manager. Also vying for one of the four open 
seats are candidates Joe Daly, 62, a civil engineer; Richard Balcerzak, 57, a 
water engineer; and Peter Kavounas, 32, a water resources engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Water agency officials complain that the reformists are running on platforms 
built more on conspiracy theories and no-growth agendas than on the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing we're troubled by is there's a certain amount of rhetoric that 
comes out of these folks," said Robert C. Sagehorn, general manager of the 
Castaic Lake Water Agency. "It's spicy material, but it's just plain wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 But the other side says it's hard to ignore the fact that the water agency is 
amid preparations for future growth, and that current residents are helping 
fund the expansion with their property taxes. Furthermore, they point to 
evidence that the agency plans to increase their water rates. 
</P>
<P>
 This is, planners believe, a valley that is but one-third built out. Twice as 
many people will put down roots here in the next 25 years, needing twice as 
much water, before this bedroom community will be considered fully developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the area's largest builder, the Newhall Land and Farming Co., has 
announced intentions to line up water for another 70,000 residents it hopes to 
attract to its future Newhall Ranch development. 
</P>
<P>
 The way to cope with all this growth -- the obligation, as Sagehorn sees it -- 
is to prepare today for the needs of tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Hence the new plant, and a number of other steps taken by the agency such as 
water reclamation, acquiring outside water rights and an attempt at buying the 
retail Santa Clarita Water Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're doing is subsidizing the areas to be developed," said Scott 
Franklin, a Santa Clarita resident and former chairman of the state Water 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 What really gets under Franklin's skin, and irks others too, is that -- in 
addition to the four elected seats -- the 11-member water board has four voting 
members who are appointed by each of the four retail outfits that sell the 
agency water. One of those outfits is the Valencia Water Co., owned by Newhall 
Land and Farming Co. 
</P>
<P>
 These board members are not elected by the public, but they get to vote on 
rate increases and fees, matters that directly affect the pocketbooks of the 
area's water customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's truly taxation without representation. And that has absolutely driven me 
crazy," Franklin said. "If I ever win the lottery, I'll take that money and 
challenge this thing in court." 
</P>
<P>
 When water agency officials, who must supply a region projected to hold 
270,000 people by 2010, undertook construction of the Rio Vista plant, they did 
so without voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they turned to a means of financing called certificates of 
participation, which -- unlike bonds -- do not require a vote of the people 
before new debt is incurred. 
</P>
<P>
 The certificates are issued as securities to investors who buy them to profit 
from the interest paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble was, detractors said, there was a perfectly good water treatment 
facility already in operation near Castaic Lake, the reservoir holding the bulk 
of the agency's state water project supplies. That one, the Earl Schmidt 
filtration plant, boasted more than enough capacity to meet the water needs of 
the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only when you looked to the distant future -- and in particular the 
construction timetables of Newhall Land and Farming Co., cynics charged -- that 
a greater need became evident. 
</P>
<P>
 "It calls to mind 'Chinatown,' " said Cameron, referring to the classic film 
recounting a 1940s-era Los Angeles water grab that benefited wealthy 
developers. "You have an example here of life imitating art." 
</P>
<P>
 Hogwash, says Ruth Newhall, a local historian and member of the Newhall 
family. "There's no 'Chinatown' going to take place here," she said. "That's 
just ridiculous. I fail to see how that would happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, a spokeswoman for Newhall Land and Farming Co., Marlee Lauffer, 
scoffed at the notion that the firm gets any special treatment from the water 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 If, as "Chinatown's" villain insisted, the only thing people really care about 
is the daily flow of water from their faucets, then arcane details of the 
public debate may fail to grab the interest of most voters. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the reliability of the water supply were threatened, or if water bills 
happened to increase, it might seize the public's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those two scenarios appears likely to occur, according to a document 
the water agency prepared for investors interested in buying its certificates 
of participation. 
</P>
<P>
 As incumbents boast of water rates held steady since 1985, the document 
details plans for hikes -- from the current $145 per acre-foot to $186 per 
acre-foot in 1995-96 and $219 per acre-foot in 1996-97. 
</P>
<P>
 (There are 326,000 gallons in one acre-foot, enough to supply two average-size 
families for one year.) 
</P>
<P>
 The agency plans to use a portion of the rate hike money, the document said, 
to help pay for the new plant, a plan that strikes Cameron as "welfare for 
developers." 
</P>
<P>
 "If they want a welfare check, let them go down to the public assistance 
office and apply for it like everyone else," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Spring, president of the board and more than anyone a defender of the 
water agency, points out that the agency's water rates have long remained well 
below the Metropolitan Water District's $412 per acre-foot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She, too, is perplexed by what she regards as the constant barrage of 
vitriolic attacks by a small cadre of inexplicably bitter critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these so-called controversies probably mean something to half of 1% of 
the people here," Spring said. "As long as that water flows out of the tap when 
they turn on the handle, what do most people care about who's planning what?" 
</P>
<P>
 A lot, according to Ed Dunn of Canyon Country, one of the leaders of the 
movement to get new blood on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are getting more and more concerned about their water supply and what 
they will have to pay for their water," Dunn said. While new members would be 
unable to reverse construction of the Rio Vista plant, they could play crucial 
roles as taxpayer advocates, he said. "At least we can try to stop them from 
spending money foolishly in the future."

OPEN FOR BUSINESS; RETAILERS: DEPARTMENT STORE IS THE FIRST ANCHOR TENANT IN 
THE QUAKE-DEVASTATED NORTHRIDGE CENTER TO REOPEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's new, it's interactive. And more importantly, more than nine months after 
the Northridge earthquake forced its closure, The Broadway at Northridge 
Fashion Center is open again. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of San Fernando Valley shoppers converged Friday to celebrate, with 
many saying the reopening provided a kind of catharsis after worrying for 
months about their own rebuilding troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Others were less analytical: They came to shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a new beginning," agreed Florence Struck of Reseda, who was most 
interested in finding kitchen curtains. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's ribbon-cutting was heralded by the Granada Hills High School marching 
band, a steel drum band and scores of Broadway employees wearing white and red 
"Glad to Be Home" T-shirts. About 100 protesters also turned out, shouting at 
Broadway Stores Inc. President David L. Dworkin over the chain's hiring 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
 The revamped department store is the first of six mall anchor stores expected 
to reopen since the 6.8-magnitude temblor put the center temporarily out of 
business the morning of Jan. 17. The 210-store Northridge mall, one of Southern 
California's largest, was a half-mile from the earthquake's epicenter and 
incurred an estimated $25 million worth of damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Miller, general manager of the Fashion Center, said Friday he does not 
know when other department stores -- including Bullock's, JC Penney and two 
Robinsons-May stores -- will reopen. The Broadway store joins a pizza 
restaurant and a car-repair shop already operating. The rest of the mall is 
scheduled to reopen in March. 
</P>
<P>
 During ceremonies Friday, union supporters -- including members of Carpenters 
Local Union 1506 -- shouted at store officials, asking why Broadway officials 
hired out-of-state companies to rebuild its store. 
</P>
<P>
 "They shafted us," said David Freeman, a carpenter and union member from 
Burbank who passed out flyers urging people to boycott the store. 
</P>
<P>
 "They hired out-of-staters to do their work and paid them lower wages and no 
benefits," said Freeman, who was wearing a hard hat and a fake plastic screw 
rigged to look like it had been driven through his torso. 
</P>
<P>
 Dworkin and other store executives downplayed the significance of the protest. 
They conceded hiring some non-union workers but said a majority of those hired 
to rebuild were union members. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour after the grand reopening, with most of the protesters gone, local 
residents indulged in a long-missed pastime. Nearly every department of the 
totally redesigned store -- from hosiery to housewares -- was crammed with 
smiling, mostly female shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sign of rebirth," customer Marie McGee of Reseda said. "Do you know 
where the curtains are? It said 'Housewares' on that funny little machine 
downstairs. Maybe they don't call them curtains anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 McGee was referring to the interactive computer screen on the second floor. 
The computerized kiosks -- which allow shoppers to find items sold at the store 
by pushing buttons on a computer screen -- are part of a series of high-tech 
additions designed to make the shopping experience more "interactive," store 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 McGee said she welcomed Friday's outing, since she had not done much shopping 
since the earthquake. "That quake shattered our lives," she said. "Now I feel 
like things are back to normal. Finally." 
</P>
<P>
 Store employees were elated too, and spent much of the day directing 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Maggie Breckner, a Northridge resident who was working at the store the night 
before the quake, arrived Friday in search of a new outfit to wear to her night 
shift in domestic goods. She remembers returning to the store two days after 
the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was scary in here," said Breckner, trying on a pair of new flats in the 
shoe department. "The columns holding up the roof were buckled, mashed like 
petals on a flower. The floor sagged. We weren't allowed in very long." 
</P>
<P>
 Crowds trawled the store's new oval layout, oohing and aahing the high-tech, 
polished finishings. The layout of each of the three earth-toned levels inside 
the store follows a football-patterned shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look around you, oval is everywhere," said Frank C. Calise, senior vice 
president for visual marketing for Broadway. And it's true. Signs overhead are 
oval. The tables displaying men's ties are oval. The bright track lighting in 
the ceiling follow an oval circuit.  
</P>
<P>
 What's with all the oval? 
</P>
<P>
 "Women enjoy oval," Calise said. "And you can see from one end of the store to 
the other. It creates a feeling of openness. You don't have to go on some 
zig-zagging yellow brick road to find the department you want." 
</P>
<P>
 Upstairs, children wandered around the store's new Funzone, a play area 
created by Calise that includes a giant talking redwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Store officials refused to say how much they have spent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spared no expense, but we're not revealing the cost," said Bill Ihle, vice 
president of corporate communications for the chain. "This store is going to be 
the model for our other renovated Broadway stores." 
</P>
<P>
 One out-of-towner who took in Friday's reopening spectacle expressed wonder at 
the size and spirit of the chatting, charging, check-writing crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like people are starved for a place to shop," said Pat Welch, 
visiting from from Oklahoma. "I want to tell them to lighten up. I'm amazed at 
how seriously they're taking all of this."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TOPANGA; FIREFIGHTERS HONORED BY THANKFUL STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 During the Topanga Canyon fires last year, Calmont School became home for 
numerous firefighters. After hours on the fire line, they made their way to the 
private school to eat meals, take showers and sleep in classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only for a few days, but the firefighters and school officials forged a 
bond that has lasted. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the private preschool and elementary school held a luncheon one 
year after the fires to show the firefighters their appreciation for saving the 
school and many nearby homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very thankful," said third-grader Noah Pasternak, who said fire crews 
saved his home in the canyon. "They did a really good job." 
</P>
<P>
 The location of the school and its large parking lot on Old Topanga Road made 
it well-suited to be a staging area for firefighters from the Pasadena, 
Burbank, Glendale and Alhambra fire departments. 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters who attended the lunch were members of two strike teams that 
were deployed from the school or another staging area in nearby Fernwood. 
Strike team members are the first to be sent to a fire when an outside fire 
department requests assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 As the blue-shirted fire personnel munched on sandwiches, potato salad and 
chocolate-chip cookies, they examined student-made wooden centerpieces 
decorated with fire engines. The students presented them with a banner and 
recited speeches and poems. 
</P>
<P>
 The serenity of the sun-dappled picnic luncheon made the fires seem light 
years away. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great looking back over your shoulder and see that you did make a 
difference," said Donald Wright, a captain with the Glendale Fire Department. 
"The kids rely on the buildings to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 Calmont School suffered no fire damage, although nearby brush was scorched. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids learned that there are more important heroes than Power Rangers," 
said school director Linda Creager. KAY HWANGBO

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; MUNICIPAL MEMORABILIA NOW FOR SALE

<P>
 Now you can have a little piece of Glendale for your very own. 
</P>
<P>
 City Shoppe, operated by City Hall, opens today on the second floor of the 
Glendale Galleria to sell a variety of city merchandise including old street 
signs, retired parking meters, used police motorcycles and new T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be a mix of both the memorabilia or surplus items, and retail 
merchandise," said Tom Marston, an assistant in the city's Finance Department 
who helped set up the new shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the experience of other cities that have tried this, it seems the 
consumers want those kinds of things." 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego and West Covina are two cities that have successfully opened shops. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale City Council allocated $25,000 toward start-up costs of the 
store, which will be run by a private firm under contract with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they believe that the store will break even in its first year 
and eventually generate as much as $1 million in profits to go into the city's 
general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 At a private reception at the store Thursday night, city officials gawked at 
the unusual selection of fire hydrants, firefighters' coats and hats, old fire 
station call boxes and other items. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob McFall, assistant city manager, said much of the inventory consists of 
items Glendale usually discards or sells at auctions. Some municipal 
memorabilia items to be sold were acquired from other cities. Some of the 
artwork, T-shirts, book bags and other items will be sold on consignment for 
local groups such as the Glendale Historical Society and Friends of the 
Glendale Library. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have devised a number of different ways to bring product in here at a low 
cost," McFall said. STEVE RYFLE

ELECTION '94; 27TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale), 72, is seeking his 12th term in 
Congress. The former state assemblyman is married and has five children. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic challenger Doug Kahn, 42, lives in Altadena and owns a typesetting 
firm. He is married and has one child. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats hope 1994 is the year they send Moorhead, the dean of California's 
GOP congressional delegation, packing. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead got a good scare in 1992 when he received only 49% of the vote while 
Kahn, who also ran that year, pulled down 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 But the incumbent won a little-noticed victory last year when Richard Sybert, 
a former top aide to Gov. Pete Wilson and a Pasadena resident, quietly decided 
not to run against him in the 27th District GOP primary. Sybert later moved to 
Calabasas where he is now running against U.S. Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson 
(D-Woodland Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 Kahn has said Moorhead is a tool of the gun lobby, voting against the Clinton 
administration crime bill, which included a ban on assault rifles. Kahn also 
contends his opponent is ineffectual and a foe of a pro-choice agenda. In a 
recent mailer, Kahn said only one of Moorhead's measures has been passed in 
Congress in a decade -- a resolution to proclaim July 13-19, 1987, "Snow White 
Week." Moorhead's retorts that Republicans are lucky to get any measures passed 
in a Democrat-controlled Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead's chief political aide, John Davies, portrays Kahn as a "man without 
a country and without a job," who has lived in five cities in 15 years, run 
unsuccessfully for the Seattle City Council and only kept himself afloat with a 
trust fund. "He shouldn't be running for Congress until he's at least been on a 
neighborhood planning board," Davies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead's campaign has been a tough, big budget affair. Moorhead, a major 
recipient of campaign contributions from the entertainment and 
telecommunications industries, is on a House panel important to these 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration in this district, which includes Burbank, Glendale, Pasadena and 
Sunland-Tujunga, is 44% Democrat, 43% Republican.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; HEALTH CARE FORUM TO TARGET ARMENIANS 
</P>

<P>
 A forum to educate Armenian immigrants on the health care options available to 
them in the United States will be held in Glendale today. 
</P>
<P>
 From 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. at St. Mary's Armenian Apostolic Church, volunteer 
physicians and other health care professionals will conduct information classes 
addressing specific health issues affecting the Armenian community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, countries in which Armenians have lived lack public health 
education," said Dr. Mihran Shirinian, a staff oncologist at Glendale Adventist 
Medical Center and an organizer of the health forum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of this, Armenians living in the U.S. may delay basic health care 
because they do not understand their health care options." 
</P>
<P>
 The forum will feature classes by seven physicians, a dentist, a psychologist, 
a chiropractor, a registered dietician and a marriage, family and child 
counselor, all of Armenian descent. The entire program will be taught in 
Armenian. 
</P>
<P>
 The topics will include emotional health, children's health, eating right, 
healthy living and prevention of cancer and heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert G. Carmen, president of Glendale Adventist, said the event will "focus 
on educating people about their health and encourage them to maintain a healthy 
way of life." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Mary's Armenian Apostolic Church is located at 500 S. Central Ave. STEVE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; COUNTY DISMISSED AS LANDSCAPE OVERSEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Calabasas, dissatisfied with the county's performance in 
overseeing landscaping operations for four special districts in the city, plans 
to take over the function, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has created a position for a full-time staff person who will oversee 
maintenance of medians, parkways, trees, Lake Calabasas and various creeks and 
slopes within the city boundaries, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The maintenance is currently overseen by the county Department of Parks and 
Recreation, which hires private contractors to do the work. 
</P>
<P>
 The maintenance is funded through special districts, which assess property 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "The homeowners have come to us and asked us to take it over," said City 
Manager Charles Cate. "The homeowners have been unhappy with the level of 
service, and they feel certain things have been neglected." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jack Hakim, president of the Vista Pointe Owners Assn.: "With the 
bureaucracy, it takes forever to get something done."  
</P>
<P>
 For example, he said, irrigation systems have been allowed to fall into 
disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
 Hakim hastened to add that he is not blaming Dale Hall, special districts 
administrator for the Department of Parks and Recreation, who works regularly 
with property owners in the districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dale Hall has done a splendid job with what he's had to do, but he has still 
had to deal with the county bureaucracy," said Hakim. "He has communicated with 
all the homeowners, but I think his hands are tied." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall said there are no hard feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of cities feel like they are better off having local control over those 
functions, and I have no problem with that," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas residents in District 22, which covers about half the city, pay 
about $621 a year per parcel to a special assessment district, according to 
city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The other three districts are assessed $120, $90 and $3,000, the latter for 29 
commercial properties. 
</P>
<P>
 That assessment amount will not change after the city takes over, city 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The landscape district maintenance manager, as the position is called, will 
report to the city engineer. The ideal candidate will have detailed knowledge 
of landscaping policies and practices, as well as the ability to prepare 
budgets, according to the job description. 
</P>
<P>
 The manager must know how to administer contracts and conduct inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 The manager will hire contractors to do the work and will serve as a liaison 
to property owners, handling their complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 The job will pay $50,000 to $60,000 a year, city officials said. FRANK MANNING

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; PEPPER SPRAY TRAINING CLASS BEING OFFERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Muggers beware. 
</P>
<P>
 After next Thursday, a phalanx of San Fernando citizens armed and trained in 
the effective use of oleoresin capsicum -- better known as pepper spray -- will 
hit the streets, packing canisters of the stinging, choking spray and laminated 
state permits to prove they know what they're doing. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Police Department and the San Fernando Chamber of Commerce 
have teamed up to provide the city's first pepper spray self-defense training 
and certification class. 
</P>
<P>
 Each trainee will receive a state certification permit and one canister of 
First Defense MK-6C pepper spray, the only brand approved by the state 
Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 To carry pepper spray legally in California, a training course -- including 
target practice -- is required, said Jim Hein, owner of the Security Training 
Center in North Hollywood and a former Los Angeles police officer who will 
teach the course. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have full-size silhouette targets set up for them to shoot," said Hein. 
"In order to receive the permit, trainees will have to hit the target in the 
head area at least three out of four times." 
</P>
<P>
 Pepper spray works when it is sprayed in the eyes, nose or mouth of the 
target. 
</P>
<P>
 "It works by causing muscle convulsions," Hein said. "If ingested, or shot 
into the mouth, the larynx will constrict and the person will have difficulty 
breathing. If it hits the eyes, it causes the eyelids to slam shut, the 
capillaries dilate. It also induces violent coughing. It works even if the 
person is drunk or on drugs -- they might not feel pain, but the person's 
muscles will still react to the chemicals." 
</P>
<P>
 Pepper spray was legalized in California in March. It is a misdemeanor to 
carry the spray without a state permit, said Mike Van Winkle of the law 
enforcement division of the state Department of Justice.  
</P>
<P>
 "Even if the spray is used in legitimate self-defense, the person could still 
be charged with a misdemeanor if they've never been certified," Van Winkle 
said. The penalty for the misdemeanor is a fine of up to $1,000. "It's a felony 
charge if used for aggressive or criminal purposes. The reason for the 
certification is just to ensure responsible and controlled use of the product," 
Van Winkle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people who carry permits for tear gas may be surprised to learn that the 
permits don't cover the use of pepper spray. "It has to be upgraded to include 
pepper spray," Hein said. 
</P>
<P>
 The one hour classes, which cost $30, will be held in the community room at 
San Fernando City Hall on Thursday from noon until 7 p.m. All proceeds will be 
donated to local Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) and Police Explorer 
programs. TIM MAY

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: COMPUTER DONATION PROGRAM EXTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Schools that had been racing to garner donations of computers in hopes of 
doubling their gain through a private foundation's gift-matching program have 
been given another four months to seek equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, the La Jolla-based Detwiler foundation created a Computers for 
Schools Matching Challenge for California schools. It pledged that for every 
computer a business donated to a school, the foundation would donate another. 
The foundation receives computers from major corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation had set a Thanksgiving deadline for schools to gather 
donations, but extended the date to March 31 because the foundation has been 
given more than 6,000 computers and related equipment to distribute -- much 
more than had been anticipated, said spokeswoman Lisa Cohn. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 24 public and private schools across the San Fernando Valley had been 
racing to meet the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to get on this as soon as we could," said Janice Walsh, principal 
of Gledhill Elementary School in North Hills. "Our hope is we will be able to 
establish an ESL lab." 
</P>
<P>
 Teaching students English and helping them overcome disabilities or get 
excited about learning are among the reasons educators gave for wanting new 
computers. Some officials said their computers are old, broken or outdated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents are concerned with getting kids technology-ready for the future," 
said Joel Robbins, a teacher at Chandler Elementary School in Sherman Oaks.  
</P>
<P>
 Robbins said Chandler is trying to get enough computers to set up a lab for 
the school of 650 students and to place computers in every classroom.  
</P>
<P>
 California schools have an average of one computer for every 20 students -- 
the third-worst ratio in the country, according to the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Robertson, principal of Lupin Hill Elementary School in Calabasas, hopes 
to upgrade the campus's existing lab of 17 computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no limit to what creative children can do," Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Knox, a special education teacher at Dearborn Elementary School in 
Northridge, hopes to use computers to help language-impaired students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a very small school and we don't have some of the programs that other 
schools have," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping to upgrade our technology without having to spend any more 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses that want to donate their old computers can call their local school 
or the Detwiler Foundation at (800) 939-6000. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; KEEN NAVIGATION WINS TOP AIR PRIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Frank Kelly entered the 16th Valley Air Derby in Van Nuys last month because 
he thought it would be "fun." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the pinpoint navigation Kelly conducted inside his blue and white 
Piper Dakota that earned the Granada Hills resident a first-place award. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew we would place, but we didn't expect to place first," said Kelly, who 
shared the title with co-pilot Larry Selznick of Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilots who participated in the annual event were required to perform seven 
flybys -- 200 feet above a timing line at speeds up to 200 m.p.h. -- at 
airports along the way to allow race officials to make sure no one had taken 
any unauthorized short cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to winning the derby was to stay strictly on course and find the 
altitudes with the best tail winds. Planes of many types flew northeast on a 
timed, 400-mile zigzag course that took them over the Grapevine, through the 
Antelope Valley and the Mojave Desert and across the southern tip of Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 The race was sponsored by the San Fernando Valley chapter of the Ninety Nines, 
an international women pilots' association whose first president was Amelia 
Earhart, America's most famous woman pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, about half of the estimated 25 competitors were men. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants called it a unique opportunity for experienced and novice pilots 
alike to sharpen their flying and navigational skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael and Paula Sandling of Woodland Hills placed second after competing in 
an orange, white and brown Cessna. 
</P>
<P>
 Diann Laing traveled from Reno with Lisa Shilling to participate. The two went 
home with a third place award. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was our first trophy," said Laing, a 53-year-old who learned to fly in 
1976. "Our goal was to fly as low and fast as we could and hope for the best." 
</P>
<P>
 The top three finishers received cash awards and trophies. 
</P>
<P>
 A portion of the funds from this year's race will go toward the Ninety Nines' 
scholarship program for student pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ninety Nines was founded in 1929 on Long Island, N.Y., to further aviation 
education and safety and promote women in aviation. Valley women pilots founded 
the local chapter, based at Van Nuys Airport, in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
 Among its 90 members are three former WASPs -- Women Air Force Service Pilots 
-- who ferried aircraft across the country and performed other flying duties 
for the military during World War II. ALICIA DOYLE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; HOME ECONOMICS TURNS TO FRENCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Home economics students at Sun Valley and Sylmar high schools will soon be 
shucking the usual recipes for chocolate chip cookies and pancakes for a more 
gourmet palette. 
</P>
<P>
 Careers through Culinary Arts Program, a nationwide project to orient home 
economics courses more toward professional cooking and other food services 
occupations, was kicked off Friday with a series of French cooking 
demonstrations for teachers by New York chef and educator Richard Grausman. 
</P>
<P>
 Home economics teachers from 17 area schools, including Sylmar High in Sylmar 
and Polytechnic in Sun Valley, watched Grausman prepare three French meals at 
workshops sponsored by the Los Angeles Unified School District, the Los Angeles 
Trade Technical College and Les Dames d'Escoffier, an organization for 
professional women in the culinary arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Grausman's creations was a three-course meal of French onion soup, fresh 
strawberry omelets and a chocolate souffle. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding French cooking to the culinary curriculum is intended to make the home 
economics classes more exciting, said Ernest Green, director of the culinary 
arts program at the technical college. 
</P>
<P>
 After participants in the program graduate from high school, they can qualify 
for scholarships to the Los Angeles Trade Technical College, California 
Culinary Academy and the Culinary Institute of America. MAKI BECKER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: EMERGENCY LIGHTS IN BUILDINGS ORDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owners of residential buildings with more than five units will be required 
to install battery-powered emergency lights to help tenants get out during an 
emergency, the Los Angeles City Council decided Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Joel Wachs, who proposed the new ordinance, said the power outages 
that followed the Northridge earthquake underscored the need for emergency 
lights to help tenants out of quake-damaged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Building officials said they don't know how many buildings would be affected 
by the ordinance but estimate at least 10,000 structures in the city would meet 
the law's criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Each battery-powered light is expected to cost about $200 to purchase and 
install, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the ordinance, the owners of a typical building with 15 to 20 units is 
likely to spend $3,000 to $4,000 to install lights in building corridors and 
stairwells, according to a city report. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of existing buildings will have up to five years to comply with the 
ordinance after they are notified by fire officials. New buildings must comply 
before they can be occupied. HUGO MARTIN

REOPENING OF FREEWAY INTERCHANGE CELEBRATED; TRANSPORTATION: WORKERS REOPEN 
LAST REMAINING SEGMENT THAT COLLAPSED IN THE NORTHRIDGE QUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With television cameras, hand-held video recorders, reporters and scores of 
proud "parents" on hand to witness the event, the region's vast freeway network 
was reborn at exactly 11 a.m. Friday as workers reopened the last remaining 
interchange that collapsed in the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 A lone California Highway Patrol car, lights flashing, escorted the first 
three cars onto the connector from the southbound Golden State Freeway to the 
northbound Antelope Valley Freeway in northern Los Angeles County, culminating 
nine months of nonstop labor in the wake of the Jan. 17 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an historic day," Gov. Pete Wilson said at a ribbon-cutting ceremony 
against a panorama of crisp blue skies and autumnal hills. "Los Angeles' 
freeways are back." 
</P>
<P>
 The restoration of the interchange was of more symbolic than real importance: 
Only 1,300 vehicles a day used the transition before the quake, compared to the 
287,000 cars and trucks that travel the freeways it connects. 
</P>
<P>
 But its repair forms the final link in a chain of post-quake roadway projects 
that began almost as soon as the shaking stopped -- reconstruction efforts that 
include the early reopening of the Santa Monica Freeway in April and the Golden 
State Freeway above Gavin Canyon in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the last installment," Wilson said, backed by a small crescent of 
dark-suited local dignitaries and a larger half-circle of workers in bright 
orange vests and white hard hats. 
</P>
<P>
 To the jazzy strains of a small brass band courtesy of nearby Magic Mountain, 
officials opened the car lane on the connector Friday. The truck lane is 
scheduled to follow in a couple of weeks, Caltrans officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The contractor, F.C.I. Constructors of San Diego, must still relocate a water 
main, remove a makeshift bunker and reseed slopes adjacent to the restored 
interchange, but those tasks should not interfere with traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans will determine whether F.C.I. is eligible for a bonus once the work 
is fully complete. The firm's $13.2-million contract allows for an extra 
$20,000 every day the project is done early. Similar incentives led to 
multimillion-dollar bonuses on other repair projects, but such a huge amount is 
not likely in this case. 
</P>
<P>
 Restoring the final two transitions of the interchange -- the segment opened 
Friday and the connector between the southbound Antelope Valley Freeway and the 
northbound Golden State Freeway, opened last week -- entailed some potentially 
perilous work conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Columns towered 138 feet above the floor of the Newhall Pass, taller than the 
80-foot bridges above Gavin Canyon on the Golden State and seven times as high 
as the downed overpasses on the Santa Monica Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Work carried on 24 hours a day, seven days a week. But there were no major 
accidents, project engineer Jay Steele said. Steele joined Wilson and a host of 
Caltrans workers in inscribing their names in a wet cement slab by the 
interchange, closure of which cost the region an estimated $126,000 a day in 
lost commerce and time. 
</P>
<P>
 For Wilson, the reopening afforded a pleasant, no-risk media and photo op just 
four days before the election. Addressing the 200 people gathered for the 
event, the governor touched on the same themes he has sounded at past freeway 
reopenings: the resilience of Angelenos, the role of his administration in 
cutting bureaucratic red tape to allow quick repair, his office's cooperation 
with federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We intend to stay in the fast lane to recovery," Wilson said. Interchange 
Reopening On Friday, the final segment of the shattered Golden State-Antelope 
Valley freeway interchange was reopened, marking the complete recovery of the 
region's freeway system after the Northridge earthquake. Officials reopened the 
connector between the southbound Antelope Valley Freeway and the northbound 
Golden State. Another segment reopened last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some numbers related to the reconstruction of the two connectors: $13.2 
million: Amount of contract. 112: Days to conclude. $20,000: Bonus for each day 
work is completed early. 4 million pounds: Steel used. 12,000 cubic yards: 
Concrete. 4,480 linear feet: Concrete pilings. 1.6 million pounds: Steel pipe. 
4.7 million pounds: Steel beams. 138 feet: Tallest column. Source: CaltransLOS

 The grenades were discovered Thursday morning when a deputy stopped Laconde's 
car for traveling too fast on Avenue R at 20th Street East, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of them was just sitting in plain view in the back, on top of something 
that looked like a tool box," said Deputy Jim Gonzales, an arson-explosives 
investigator who was summoned to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales said two more grenades and a handgun were also found inside the car. 
Deputies diverted traffic to other streets and told teachers at a nearby 
elementary school to keep their students indoors while experts inspected and 
removed the devices. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of grenades were World War II-vintage "pineapple" devices, while the third 
was a more modern "baseball" type, Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
 One grenade had a fuse but no gunpowder, while another had gunpowder but no 
fuse. By interchanging the parts, Laconde could have assembled one operable 
grenade, the investigator said. "It doesn't take a lot of skill or time," 
Gonzales said. "It just takes a little thought to put it together." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies took the devices to a remote desert area and disassembled them. 
Laconde did not tell deputies much about where the grenades came from. "He said 
he got them from a friend," Gonzales said.

MAN SHOT IN CARJACKING ATTEMPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man opened fire on a motorist, seriously wounding him, after the driver 
refused to surrender his car, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The motorist, Mario Ayala, believed to be in his 20s, remained in serious 
condition at Northridge Hospital Medical Center on Friday with a bullet wound 
to his chest, police said.He is expected to recover, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman fled after the attack, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred about 8:45 p.m. Thursday as Ayala and a friend were 
driving his newly purchased car -- a purple 1988 Nissan Sentra with custom 
rims, said LAPD Detective Mel Arnold. As they drove down the 7800 block of 
Peachtree Avenue, a man walked into the middle of the street, and Ayala, 
thinking it was a friend, stopped the car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, however, drew a pistol and demanded that Ayala give him the car, 
Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, police said Ayala stepped on the accelerator and the gunman fired 
several shots through the windshield.  
</P>
<P>
 Ayala, who was wounded, continued driving for about a block until the car 
slammed into a fire hydrant, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 His friend was not hurt, Arnold said. Police have no suspects.

ACCESS POSES PROBLEM FOR NEW PARK; PALO COMADO CANYON: THAT, COUPLED WITH LACK 
OF PARKING, BRINGS COMPLAINTS FROM PUBLIC AT TWO HEARINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Even though he lives on a cul-de-sac, sometimes weekend traffic in his Oak 
Park neighborhood is so bad that Bill O'Bryan has a hard time backing out of 
his driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 All too often, his street is lined with the cars of hikers, joggers and 
mountain bikers using a nearby trail head to explore one of the National Park 
Service's most recent acquisitions, Palo Comado Canyon, better known as Jordan 
Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 The park is lovely, O'Bryan agrees. But from his viewpoint -- namely his 
driveway -- it sure would be nice if visitors to the rolling meadows of China 
Flat and the narrow oak-lined canyon beyond could find somewhere else to leave 
their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to see the trail shut down," O'Bryan said. "That's not what 
we're after. But the parks people do have to work out the traffic problem. This 
is the front of my house, not a parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
 After five years of battling by environmentalists to keep development out of 
Palo Comado Canyon, the biggest problem with the new park is how to get more 
people into the pristine setting without making trail head neighbors like 
O'Bryan miserable. 
</P>
<P>
 In two public workshops this week, park officials kept hearing the same 
refrain: How can the public get better access to Palo Comado Canyon? 
</P>
<P>
 "If you really want to get there, you can get there," said Ginger Pollack, a 
member of the environmental group Save Open Space, which fought to preserve the 
canyon. "But you really have to want to get there to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very ironic because the whole time we were fighting with Ahmanson (Land 
Co.) over Jordan Ranch, that was our whole argument, the lack of access," 
Pollack added. "There was nothing the developer could do with it because there 
was no access to it." 
</P>
<P>
 The park service bought the land from entertainer Bob Hope in June for $16.7 
million as part of a complex parkland-for-development deal with Ahmanson Land 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
 There are three access trails into the park now, but only one of them is 
through national parkland and has adequate parking. The other two cut through 
open space in Oak Park managed by the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District. 
</P>
<P>
 "People would just like better access in Palo Comado," said David Gackenbach, 
superintendent of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, the arm 
of the National Park Service that manages Palo Comado and adjacent Cheeseboro 
Canyon. "They don't have time, or it takes too long to get there." 
</P>
<P>
 Entering through Cheeseboro Canyon, visitors need to hike for two miles before 
they cross down into Palo Comado, Gackenbach said. Palo Comado runs parallel to 
Cheeseboro, pushing five or six miles deep into the Simi Hills to a spectacular 
summit near China Flat. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they want to see the whole canyon, we're talking about a 10- to 15-mile 
round trip," Gackenbach said. "So they would like easier access through Oak 
Park or up on Chesebro Road. We will try and address those issues." 
</P>
<P>
 The park service is developing a comprehensive management plan for both 
canyons and is gathering public comment about what to do with the 4,400-acre 
site. Public meetings were held in Simi Valley and at Cheeseboro Canyon this 
week. And a third meeting is planned for 7:30 tonight at A. E. Wright Middle 
School in Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the wishes of the public into account, the park service wants to make a 
draft plan available for public review by the fall of 1995. A final plan should 
be ready by 1996, Gackenbach said. At that point, the park service would begin 
trail work and improvements in the canyons, such as putting in bathrooms, 
campgrounds or picnic areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the lack of direct access, many Oak Park and Agoura residents have 
found ways into nearby Palo Comado Canyon. They park their cars at a Rancho 
Simi trail head on Sunnycrest Drive and walk a short way up a slope to a 
National Park Service gate, then descend into the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The hardier hikers park on the cul-de-sac at King James Court or on Lindero 
Road and make their way up a steep hill to China Flat, then descend into Palo 
Comado. A favorite routine, many residents said, is to leave one car at King 
James and one at Sunnycrest, then hike up from Sunnycrest, coming back down at 
King James and avoiding the strenuous climb. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On most days, there are at least half a dozen cars parked on Sunnycrest near 
the trail head, according to nearby residents. No homes face directly onto that 
street, but some residents said they are concerned that Sunnycrest is turning 
into a makeshift parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually there are a lot of strange cars out there," Larry Greco said. "I 
think it increases our risk of break-ins and burglaries." 
</P>
<P>
 Greco said he recently chased off a burglar at his home. 
</P>
<P>
 "My gut feeling is that it was one of those people that park there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Bryan also said he believed that the risk of crime in his suburban 
neighborhood is heightened by outsiders parking at the trail heads. He said he 
caught a man using crack cocaine at the trail head and has seen teen-agers 
firing guns on the trail.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; COUNCIL, WATER AGENCY OK REDEVELOPMENT PACT; 
SANTA CLARITA: CITY TO CUT $1.1-BILLION PLAN'S SCOPE, SAFEGUARDING DISTRICT TAX 
REVENUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council and Castaic Lake Water Agency have resolved their differences 
over the city's $1.1-billion redevelopment plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency will drop its lawsuit against the city's redevelopment plan in 
exchange for cutting the plan's scope by one-fourth and safeguarding tax 
revenues the agency uses to pay bond debts, officials announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The conceptual agreement, approved in closed-session votes by each agency this 
week, allows Santa Clarita to proceed with the 30-year plan that has been 
blocked in court for eight months. City Council members approved the plan in 
February to aid recovery from the Northridge earthquake, improve roads and 
other infrastructure, redevelop blighted areas and build affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This issue has been settled," said Mayor George Pederson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll take this agreement to our respective staffs and our attorneys and they 
will work together to hammer out the legal (details)," said water agency Board 
President Mary Spring. 
</P>
<P>
 City and water officials have been fighting over hundreds of millions of 
dollars in future tax increases that will occur here during the next 30 years 
as property values rise. The city wants the money for the redevelopment agency, 
but the water agency wants the funds to pay off bond debts incurred for various 
construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides have agreed to cap the Community Recovery Plan at $854 million in 
projects, down from the originally proposed $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, the redevelopment agency will collect portions of future 
general property taxes but will not receive any portion of special taxes that 
have been imposed to pay for special construction projects, such as the water 
district's Rio Vista Water Treatment Plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the agreement will settle the water agency lawsuit against the 
redevelopment plan but fails to address the legal action's main contention -- 
that the plan wrongly includes projects that go beyond earthquake recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, we're not dealing with that," Spring said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 An earlier agreement between Pederson and Spring nearly settled the legal 
fight last month. It too called for a scaled-back plan, but fell apart when the 
water district learned that redevelopment was to have been funded with money 
siphoned from special tax districts as well as general property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the sticking issue," Pederson said. The deal was struck when the 
city agreed to eliminate the special tax districts as a source of redevelopment 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members had reacted angrily last week when the water agency abandoned 
the earlier agreement, threatening to proceed with Santa Clarita's full-sized 
redevelopment plan and to fight the water agency in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations resumed this week, however, and officials on both sides sound 
willing to forgive any harsh words uttered during the squabble. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Castaic Lake Water Agency and city representatives have worked diligently 
to fashion a fair compromise which meets the mission of both agencies and the 
needs of the citizens of Santa Clarita," Spring said.

 ISLAMIC BUILDING: At its annual fund-raising banquet tonight, the Islamic 
Center of Northridge will report that wood framing and walls began going up 
last month for a $2.5-million Muslim worship complex in Granada Hills that is 
expected to be ready by the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Islamic center will have a 400-person-capacity prayer hall, 12 
classrooms, library, offices and social hall as well as parking for 200 cars. 
Officials broke ground for the center one year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers for the banquet, which begins at 6 p.m., at the Sheraton Universal 
Hotel are Imam Siraj Wahhaj, a mosque leader in Brooklyn, N.Y., and the first 
Muslim to deliver prayers before Congress, and Misbah El Dereiny, administrator 
of Omar Ibn al-Khetab Mosque in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets are $100 for adults and $50 for children, said spokesman Hasan Mulla. 
For information, call 363-1132. 
</P>
<P>
 ONE MOODY RESIGNS: The Rev. Patrick Moody, 41, will leave the ministerial 
staff of Shepherd of the Hills Church, where his father, Jess, is pastor, to 
accept the pastorate next month of the First Baptist Church of Del Cerro in La 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Moody, 69, who said he has no plans to retire, will lose the 
services not only of Patrick, who was co-pastor of the 7,000-member 
congregation, but also of Amy Moody, the church's music and choir director. 
</P>
<P>
 Both congregations are aligned with the Southern Baptist Convention. 
</P>
<P>
 JEWISH SINGER: Sol Zim, a popular Jewish composer, recording artist and cantor 
from New York, will perform tonight and Sunday night at San Fernando Valley 
synagogues. 
</P>
<P>
 Zim, backed at times by a 140-voice youth choir, will sing Israeli, Hasidic 
and Yiddish songs as well as Broadway and cantorial selections at 7:30 tonight 
at Temple Ramat Zion in Northridge and 7 p.m. Sunday at Burbank Temple Emanu 
El. 
</P>
<P>
 Zim's concerts resemble a "Jewish revival" because the artist encourages 
audience participation, a representative said. Tickets are available at varying 
prices from Temple Ramat Zion (818) 360-1881, or Burbank Temple Emanu El (818) 
845-1734. 
</P>
<P>
 QUAKE FUND-RAISER: First Presbyterian Church of North Hollywood, whose main 
sanctuary was demolished last month because of irreparable earthquake damage, 
will stage a variety show featuring Hollywood and local talent Sunday night at 
the church's Caldwell Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-hour production, starting at 7 p.m., includes actress Liz Torres, 
co-star of NBC's "The John Larroquette Show;" magician Tony MacLaren and comic 
Sherrie Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
 Admissions to the fund-raising event at 5000 Colfax Ave. are $10 each, $15 for 
couples and $25 for families. The congregation needs funds to renovate 
remaining facilities and meet other costs. JOHN DART

RELIGION / JOHN DART; JEWISH PASTORAL LETTER IS DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rabbis in the Conservative wing of Judaism have postponed final approval of a 
groundbreaking pastoral letter that says "a measure of morality" is attainable 
in mature, committed sexual relations between unmarried men and women. 
</P>
<P>
 The consensus statement would be the first public document by a major 
religious body, Jewish or Christian, to establish standards for sexual 
relations between single people, instead of condemning them. 
</P>
<P>
 The executive council of the Rabbinical Assembly decided Oct. 25 at its 
meeting in New York City to have its Jewish law committee review the seventh 
and latest draft of the "Jewish Pastoral Letter on Sexual Intimacy." After any 
revisions its members make, the executive council will vote on it at its Jan. 
24 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is more a matter of process than substantive change," said the letter's 
author, Rabbi Elliot Dorff, rector of the University of Judaism in Bel-Air in 
the Sepulveda Pass. Dorff is a member of both the law committee and the 
executive council. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've already started working on educational materials for adults and 
teen-agers that would accompany this letter," Dorff said. "The idea is to 
publish it in pamphlet form so that it can be widely used in Conservative 
synagogues and institutions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft, which is 68 manuscript pages, states that loving, committed 
relationships "can embody a measure of morality" in sexual intimacy when 
couples follow ethical norms expected of married Jewish partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Consensual sex, fidelity, attention to birth control and healthy practices are 
among the considerations cited for men and women who have decided they won't or 
can't live up to the Jewish ideal of married love, according to the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Several mainline Christian denominations have tried to fashion broad 
statements on human sexuality that encountered controversy and rejection when 
early drafts attempted to soften traditional opposition to homosexual relations 
and unmarried heterosexual intimacy. Most religious bodies concluded that 
endorsing anything other than married male-female sex would be untrue to their 
religious understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorff said the Rabbinical Assembly's letter on intimacy has succeeded where 
others have stalled because the rabbis are speaking to those matters on which 
there is consensus and leaving the most difficult questions, such as gay and 
lesbian union rites and ordination to the rabbinate, to be handled by the 
Jewish law committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Top officials of the United Synagogue, the umbrella organization for 
Conservative congregations, have informally indicated their approval of the 
pastoral letter, said Rabbi Joel Meyers of New York, executive vice president 
of the Rabbinical Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers and Rabbi Alan Silverstein, Rabbinical Assembly president, discussed 
the document with United Synagogue board members in August. "Most of them were 
very supportive and wanted to know what we were going to do with it," Meyers 
said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; GUNMAN IN FATAL SHOOTING OF ATTACKER WILL NOT 
BE CHARGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A prosecutor declined to file charges Friday against a Lake Los Angeles man 
arrested in a fatal shooting, saying the gunman was only trying to save his 
girlfriend from a brutal beating by her former landlord. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred Abel, 40, fatally wounded Michael Rene Chiasson, 38, of Palmdale 
because Chiasson, angry about rent money he said the woman owed, attacked her. 
</P>
<P>
 "He slammed her head against a truck and threw her on the ground," said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Myron Jenkins. "He was seen choking and hitting her. She was 
yelling for help." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the shooting, "it was a clear case of acting in the defense of others," 
said Jenkins, who reviewed the reports submitted by sheriff's homicide 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Abel, who had been in jail in Lancaster since the shooting, was released 
Friday afternoon, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began about 4:30 p.m. Wednesday when Chiasson pulled up in front 
of Abel's house in the 17600 block of East Highacres Avenue. Outside, he 
confronted Abel's live-in girlfriend, a 26-year-old woman whose name was 
withheld, and demanded rent money she allegedly owed him, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got into an argument with the woman in front of the house and began 
hitting her," Deputy Benita Hinojos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins, the prosecutor, said Chiasson, at 5 feet, 11 inches tall and 190 
pounds, overpowered the woman, who is 5 feet, 3 inches tall and 90 to 100 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Abel's 14-year-old son, who witnessed the beating, ran inside to get his 
father, who emerged with a .45-caliber semi-automatic pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came out and told (Chiasson) to stop beating the lady," Jenkins said. "She 
managed to break free, but (Chiasson) started to pursue her and said he wanted 
to kill her." 
</P>
<P>
 Abel, who is partially paralyzed on his right side, attempted to cock and fire 
the gun with one hand, aiming at Chiasson's legs, the prosecutor said. The gun 
suddenly discharged, and a bullet struck Chiasson in the lower abdomen, 
severing an artery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appeared . . . that (Abel) was aiming low, and he probably didn't have 
good control," Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Abel called paramedics, unloaded his weapon and cooperated with deputies who 
arrived at the scene, investigators said. Chiasson was airlifted to Antelope 
Valley Hospital, where he died about 30 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies found blood on the woman's face and bruises on her throat, and she 
was treated at the scene by paramedics. "There really isn't any dispute about 
the facts of the assault on the female," Jenkins said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; FOX FIELD SHOW TO CELEBRATE AVIATION, AIRPORT; 
LANCASTER: IT MAY NOT BE AS BIG AS LAST MONTH'S EDWARDS EXTRAVAGANZA, BUT 
SUNDAY'S AIR FAIR PROMISES EXCITEMENT.

<P>
 Famed aviator Chuck Yeager won't be there. The B-2 stealth bomber won't fly 
overhead. And there certainly won't be 250,000 people in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all that, the Fox Field Air Fair and Appreciation Day -- to be held 
Sunday in the shadow of last month's behemoth air show at Edwards Air Force 
Base -- promises some of its own, albeit less fantastic, highlights. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a local air show. We will never attract a quarter of a million 
people," said Jeff Coonrod, who helped organize the event. "What we're trying 
to do here is make the surrounding cities familiar with the airport, give them 
an idea of what they do out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Dincau, another organizer, said, "A lot of people that live out in the 
Antelope Valley don't even know the airport exists." 
</P>
<P>
 The fair, which is free, begins at 7 a.m. with the liftoff of a few hot air 
balloons. While a handful of airplanes will do flyovers during the day, most of 
the activity will be on the ground. Dincau said the high cost of an air show, 
particularly the liability insurance, is why the annual event features mostly 
static displays. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Dincau said, there will be plenty to see and do. About 30 members 
of the Experimental Aircraft Assn. are expected to bring their home-built 
aircraft to the fair. 
</P>
<P>
 A local remote-controlled airplane club will put on demonstrations throughout 
the day and a glider will land at Fox Field at about 9 a.m. There will be two 
sky diving jumps, at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., each featuring four parachutists. 
</P>
<P>
 The Condor Squadron will have four World War II vintage airplanes on display. 
Dincau said a formation flyby at 4 p.m. will bring the air fair to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 An amphibious airplane used in World War II, a PBY, will be flown in from 
Minnesota for the fair. The twin-engine plane is owned by the Arizona Wing of 
the Confederate Air Force and was used for air-sea rescue and mine-laying 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Marta Bohn-Meyer, the first female SR-71 crew member, and her husband, Bob, 
will bring their aerobatic biplane to the fair and may do a flyby, Coonrod 
said. The air racer Nemesis, which holds four national titles, will also be on 
display. And at noon the U.S. Forest Service will do a water drop. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fox Airport Assn., the primary sponsor of the event, will be offering a 
pancake breakfast from 8 to 11 a.m. The $3 charge for adults and $2 cost for 
children includes pancakes, sausage, juice and coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 Aircraft memorabilia and other souvenirs will be on sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers expect about 2,000 people to attend. To reach Fox Field, take the 
Antelope Valley Freeway to the Avenue G exit, go west to the airport, which is 
located at 4555 West Ave. G.

SPURS' OPENER LEAVES THEIR FANS SOAKED

 The San Antonio Spurs' season opener was delayed for 50 minutes Friday night 
when a fireworks display triggered the Alamodome sprinkler system, drenching 
fans, players and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 A high-pressure water cannon at the back of the stadium's eastern lower 
grandstand shot water out over the crowd shortly after the fireworks display 
that accompanied player introductions for the Spurs' game against the Golden 
State Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 The cannon blasted water at pressures as high as 2,900 gallons per minute for 
four minutes, according to Alamodome director Mike Abington. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a technical malfunction, " Abington said. "The response was shocking." 
</P>
<P>
 The fire-control system is triggered by ultraviolet sensors in the Alamodome 
roof. The sensors have a 30-second fail-safe delay to allow the system to be 
aborted. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the sensor triggered the water cannon immediately, Abington said. 
Alamodome crews had covered the ceiling sensors because of the fireworks 
display, but one of the covers came off. 
</P>
<P>
 The stream initially hit only the crowd but gradually became stronger and 
reached the court. The Alamodome loudspeaker system urged fans to stay calm and 
not to panic. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the hundreds of fans soaked by the water were sitting in the 
season-ticket area. Some broke out umbrellas and most took the surprise soaking 
in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Republican National Convention site-selection committee were in 
the Alamodome when the mishap occurred, Spur President Jack Diller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We obviously regret that this situation occurred," he said.

NBA ROUNDUP; HURLEY TAKES KINGS PAST SUNS, 107-89 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bobby Hurley completed his remarkable comeback from a near-fatal auto crash 
with 11 points and five assists Friday night, helping the Kings to a 107-89 
victory over the Phoenix Suns in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitch Richmond led the Kings with 20 points. Seven Sacramento players scored 
in double figures, including Walt Williams with 16 and Olden Polynice with 13. 
The Kings led by as many as 29 points in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayman Tisdale had 16 points for the Suns, expected to be contenders for the 
NBA title, who were playing without Charles Barkley. Danny Manning added 14 
points before fouling out early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Hurley's first regular-season game since Dec. 12, when his car was 
broadsided by a station wagon as he drove home from a King loss. His injuries 
included collapsed lungs and a severed windpipe, and he clung to life during 
eight hours of surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurley had seven points as the Kings went on a 21-3 run midway through the 
second period to turn a tie into an 18-point Sacramento lead. Hurley also had a 
steal and an lob pass to Williams for a dunk during the run. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way it turned out couldn't have been written any better," Hurley said, 
balancing a huge ice pack on his right knee. "I had the confidence I could be 
back because I put the time in to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento never trailed in the game, in which Phoenix shot 38% and was 
outrebounded, 56-38. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley was sidelined after burning his corneas when he inadvertently rubbed 
body lotion into his eyes during an Eric Clapton concert Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 110, Orlando 108 -- Rex Chapman hit a running jumper with less than 
a second left as the Bullets overcame a 17-point deficit and Shaquille O'Neal's 
28 points to defeat the Magic in Landover. Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington trailed, 108-107, with 2.4 seconds left when Mitchell Butler 
bounced an inbound pass from midcourt to Chapman, who sank a 20-footer from the 
left side of the key. He was fouled by Horace Grant and made the free throw for 
the final margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman's basket set off a wild celebration by the Bullets, who won only 24 
games last season. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal scored seven of Orlando's final nine points, grabbed 12 rebounds and 
helped foul out Washington centers Kevin Duckworth and Gheorghe Muresan. Grant, 
obtained as a free agent during the off-season, scored 20 in his debut and Nick 
Anderson had 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Gugliotta scored 24 points, Chapman 21 and Calbert Cheaney 20 for the 
Bullets, who won an opener for the first time since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 91, Philadelphia 86 -- With management still waiting to finalize the 
contract of the NBA's No. 1 draft pick, Glenn Robinson, Milwaukee opened its 
season with a five-point victory at home over the 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
 Vin Baker scored 11 of his 19 points in the fourth quarter to lead the Bucks. 
Reserve Marty Conlon added a career-high 20 and Johnny Newman also scored 20 
for Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 120, Boston 107 -- The Knicks, who fell one victory short of the NBA 
title last season, won the final season opener at 65-year-old Boston Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eastern Conference champions were led by Charles Smith, who scored 23 
points, and Patrick Ewing, who had 21 points and a game-high 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Knicks' seventh consecutive victory over the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominique Wilkins, Boston's main off-season acquisition, scored 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 90, New Jersey 86 -- Hakeem Olajuwon scored 19 points, including a 
turnaround jumper with 1:17 left, as the Rockets opened defense of their NBA 
title by beating the Nets in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Derrick Coleman led New Jersey with 20 points. Otis Thorpe and Vernon Maxwell 
each scored 17 for the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 130, Minnesota 108 -- Bryant Stith scored 25 points and Robert Pack had 
23 as the Nuggets easily defeated the Timberwolves in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Donyell Marshall led the Timberwolves with 26 points in his NBA debut, 
including five three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 94, Atlanta 92 -- Antonio Davis hit two free throws with four seconds 
remaining as the Pacers edged the Hawks in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks had two chances to force overtime in the final seconds when Ken 
Norman missed a running jumper in the lane and Kevin Willis failed on a follow 
tip. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Jackson led the Pacers with 21 points in his debut and Reggie Miller 
added 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Willis led the Hawks with 24 points and 17 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 89, Charlotte 83 -- Jo Jo English sparked an 11-0 run early in the 
fourth quarter as the Bulls opened their United Center era with a victory over 
the Hornets in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Scottie Pippen scored 22 points for Chicago, which held Charlotte to three 
baskets in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Johnson had 17 points for the Hornets, who are 4-23 against the Bulls. 
Charlotte played without injured center Alonzo Mourning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls moved into their new, $175-million arena after spending their first 
28 seasons at Chicago Stadium. The crowd of 22,313 was the largest to see a 
Bulls game and gave them their 341st consecutive sellout since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State 123, San Antonio 118 -- Tim Hardaway scored 29 points to lead the 
Warriors past the Spurs at the Alamodome in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 David Robinson and Avery Johnson led the Spurs with 27 points each. Terry 
Cummings and Sean Elliott each had 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 119, Miami 108 -- Jeff Hornacek scored 21 points and Karl Malone added 
20, including 14 in the third quarter, as the Jazz opened the season with a 
victory in Salt Lake City.

WORTHY'S RETIREMENT DISCUSSED BUT NOT CERTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forward James Worthy, who contemplated retiring during the summer, is again 
talking to the Lakers about ending his career, the team said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been discussions," General Manager Mitch Kupchak said Friday 
before the Lakers opened the season with a 115-98 victory over the Detroit 
Pistons."It's not the kind of thing you put off until sometime at a later date 
or put on the back burner. It's something that is being addressed immediately, 
and hopefully sometime soon we will have a decision." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers caution, however, that, contrary to some reports, Worthy has not 
made up his mind. He bought some extra time before having to play by going on 
the injured list Thursday because of tendinitis in his left knee and lack of 
basketball conditioning after sitting out the final three exhibition games 
after the death of his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you one thing," Executive Vice President Jerry West said. "This is 
not something etched in stone." 
</P>
<P>
 Worthy -- who is scheduled to make $7.2 million this season and $5.15 million 
in 1995-96 as the final two years of his contract -- could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 1 pick in the 1982 draft and seven-time All-Star is beginning his 13th 
season with the Lakers, the longest tenure with one team among all active 
players. He struggled through last season, posting a career low in scoring, 
shooting and minutes, and is expected to have a far lesser role this campaign 
after the acquisition of Cedric Ceballos. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to get into that now," Coach Del Harris said when asked where 
Worthy would fit in with this team. "Let's wait and see what happens."LOS

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; MARINA SLOWS BUT CAN'T STOP FOOTMAN, 
ESPERANZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Marina's defense did a solid job of containing Esperanza standout running back 
Dahrin Footman but couldn't stop him, and that was the difference as the Aztecs 
won, 20-13, in a Sunset League game Friday at Westminster High. 
</P>
<P>
 Footman, a senior, finished with 180 yards in 33 carries but only had two runs 
for more than 10 yards. Marina, obviously helped by a strong scouting report, 
played as many as nine players on the line of scrimmage at times. 
</P>
<P>
 Footman was at his best when Esperanza needed to run out the final 2 minutes 
59 seconds. He carried six consecutive times for 33 yards and two first downs, 
preventing Marina from getting another chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to the (Marina) coach, they knew when we were going to run and when 
we were going to pass," said Footman, who has rushed for 1,554 yards this 
season. "They played us pretty hard and got a few good hits in on me." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory assures Esperanza (6-3, 3-1 in league) of a playoff berth. The 
Aztecs also remain in second place, a game behind Los Alamitos, the top-ranked 
team in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza was coming off a 35-32 loss to Los Alamitos last week, and Coach 
Gary Meek wasn't sure how his players would respond against Marina. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty uninspired but we got the win," he said. "We came out pretty 
flat and Marina played us hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza's defense was especially hard on Marina quarterback Matt Roberson, 
who completed five of 21 passes for 113 yards. He did have two passes dropped 
in a streak of 11 consecutive misses. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberson completed a 28-yard scoring pass to Aron Bergman with 2:59 left in 
the game, but Esperanza turned to Footman and ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Footman started the scoring with an eight-yard run at the 11:53 mark of the 
second quarter. The Aztecs led, 7-0, at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza went up, 14-0, when quarterback Chris Stretch scored on a two-yard 
run on fourth down with 9:54 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina (6-3, 1-3) finally scored when Mike Williams reached the end zone from 
one yard with 1:13 left in the third quarter. The touchdown was set up by a 
58-yard pass from Roberson to Bergman, who was tackled at the Esperanza 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza scored again when Stretch went six yards around end with 10:27 left 
in the game.

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; SERVITE CLINCHES SHARE OF LEAGUE TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Servite finally plucked what was ripe for the taking. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friars clinched a share of a Golden West League championship, the first, 
with a 32-8 victory over Westminster Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a milestone, clearly. How impressive of one, well, that's a little hazy. 
</P>
<P>
 For a supposed big-time title game, it had more than a few gaffes -- from 
Westminster botching an onside kick attempt in the opening seconds to Servite's 
Mike Daniels dropping a sure interception on the game's final play. 
</P>
<P>
 But what does one expect in a league where four of the six teams started the 
night with two or fewer victories? Still, the Friars are champions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sort of fell into it," Friar Coach Larry Toner said. "We made mistake 
after mistake after mistake. It was ugly." 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly a rousing acceptance speech. But, a title is a title. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, that's satisfying," Toner said. "But I think our kids are looking toward 
the playoffs. They want to test themselves against the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that's happened before. If those game films still exist, the Friars can 
watch that 55-14 thrashing at the hands of Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've come miles since then," Toner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friars (7-2, 4-0) made a bit of a U-turn Friday, but eventually got 
pointed in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite rushed for 243 yards, 127 by David Bedard. He scored two touchdowns. 
Martin Smith (51 yards), scored three touchdowns. Frank Patti chipped in 75 
face-first yards. That was the extent of the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the Friars were in danger of being overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster wasn't going to wow anyone on offense. The Lions (6-3, 3-1) have 
yet to beat a team with a winning record. The Lions seemed well aware of this, 
as they looked for any shell game that would work. 
</P>
<P>
 The onside kick attempt on the opening kickoff caught Servite napping. But the 
ball bounced through the arms of a Lion player and out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster also tried a slight-of-hand offense late in the first half. Its 
formation of seven players wide left and the quarterback, center and a couple 
receivers right, confused the Friars for a time. The Lions even made some 
modest progress. 
</P>
<P>
 But any chance of building on it vanished when quarterback Jerry Allison was 
carried off the field with a leg injury in the second quarter. Mike Vit, his 
replacement, was six of 17 and created a slew of divots. 
</P>
<P>
 "When their quarterback went out, the whole complexion of the game changed," 
Toner said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Friars feasted. The Friars forced four turnovers. Tony McCanta 
recovered two fumbles. Matt Paul intercepted a pass and forced a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster finished with 217 yards, but 47 on a fake punt when the game was 
well out of reach.

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; SONORA LOSES, BUT STILL WINS SHARE OF

 While Fullerton celebrated its 12-7 homecoming victory over Sonora on Friday, 
the Raiders unknowingly backed into a share of their first league championship 
in 21 years by virtue of Buena Park's upset of second-place Troy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora (5-4, 3-1) can win the Freeway League title outright with a victory 
over Sunny Hills Thursday, but that's one of the few things for certain in the 
league race. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (5-4, 2-2) can get a piece of the league title if it beats Troy 
(2-2) and Sonora loses. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora was six yards away from victory, but the Indians sacked quarterback 
Kevin Rodriguez three consecutive times with less than a minute to play to keep 
their title chances alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora had started its final drive on its 44 with 4:44 remaining when a short 
run followed by a facemask penalty put the ball at Fullerton's 39. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez hit Shawn Brass with a 13-yard pass on third and eight, then 
completed an 11-yard pass to Mark Gonzalez on fourth and eight. Fullerton's 
Mario Ramirez was called for spearing on the play, giving Sonora a first down 
at the eight. 
</P>
<P>
 After Albert Lopez ran the ball to the six, Tyler Brickell sacked Rodriguez 
for a seven-yard loss and Ramirez then had consecutive sacks, ending the Raider 
drive at the 38. 
</P>
<P>
 "They played great defensively," Sonora Coach Mark Takkinen said. "They 
stopped everything, it's the best defense a team has played against us this 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton took a 6-0 lead with 2 minutes 40 seconds left in the first quarter 
when Christopher Young, who rushed for 130 yards in 24 carries, scored on a 
six-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders answered when Angel Cueva intercepted a pass and returned it eight 
yards to the Fullerton 18. Three plays later, Rodriguez rolled right and threw 
across the field to Lopez for a 16-yard scoring pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians went ahead in the third quarter when a short punt and a facemask 
call gave Fullerton the ball at the Raider 16. Young then followed with a 
three-yard touchdown run with 2:44 left in the quarter.

 Rik Currier started the game at quarterback Friday for Capistrano Valley, 
replacing Tim Hirchag, who was still banged up from last week. Although Currier 
failed to complete a pass, the 5-foot-9 sophomore made his presence felt by 
scoring on a six-yard dive. 
</P>
<P>
 That must have been especially galling for the Cougars' opponent, Dana Hills, 
because last spring Currier was throwing fastballs for the Dolphin baseball

defensive end Todd Silski sacked Villa Park quarterback Sean McMahon for a 
10-yard loss. Silski could do no celebrating, however. 
</P>
<P>
 One of McMahon's fingers was stuck in Silski's facemask, and the game was 
halted for several minutes while trainers tried to pry it loose. They succeeded 
by unscrewing Silski's facemask. 
</P>
<P>
 The result? McMahon got to stay in the game while Silski had to leave the 
field for two plays while trainers attended to tightening his facemask. FRIDAY 
NIGHT LIGHTS 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente fans tend to take their high school football seriously. One in 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
 A sign on a house above San Clemente's football field reads, "Go Tritons." 
It's decked out with lights that are flashed every time the Tritons score a 
touchdown. ON THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard to come back from something like that. It was hard to get ready 
this week, but you just have to get through it."

 -- Dahrin Footman, Esperanza running back, on playing Marina Friday after 
losing to Los Alamitos, 35-32, last week. LOOKING AHEAD 
</P>
<P>
 Big game of the week? 
</P>
<P>
 It's in the Pacific Coast League, where Laguna Hills (7-2, 4-0) goes up 
against Costa Mesa (7-1-1, 3-0-1) for the league title Friday night at Newport 
Harbor High. The game will feature two of the county's top running backs: 
Brendan McGraw of Laguna Hills and the Mustangs' Charles Chatman. 
</P>
<P>
 Mismatches of the week? 
</P>
<P>
 Take your pick. On Thursday night, No. 1-ranked Los Alamitos (9-0) closes out 
the Sunset League season playing host to Huntington Beach (1-8) at Veterans 
Stadium. On Friday, No. 2-ranked Mater Dei (9-0) travels south to play at Dana 
Hills (0-9). 
</P>
<P>
 And who will qualify for the playoffs from the Orange League? 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows. But before checking out next week's schedule, keep an eye on 
tonight's games, which find Savanna playing host to Anaheim at Western High and 
Brea-Olinda matched against Magnolia at Glover Stadium. IT DIDN'T HELP . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley's troubles against Los Alamitos on Thursday night began with 
the absence of two injured starters, free safety Devin O'Day and cornerback 
Kevin McCluskey. Los Alamitos quarterback Kevin Feterik passed for 402 yards in 
three quarters -- the fifth-best total in Orange County history -- in the 
Griffins' 45-14 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse for the Barons, during the game, quarterback Chris 
Ponchak suffered a two-inch cut on his left palm and will likely miss 
Thursday's Sunset League finale against Esperanza. ON THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired chasing after all those receivers." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Kral, Fountain Valley defensive back, near the end of the third 
quarter of Thursday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone up there wants to be you right now. I even want to be you right 
now." 
</P>

LOS ALAMITOS; AH SIGH WINS ED BURKE FUTURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STACY PIGOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Favored Ah Sigh won her seventh race in eight career starts in the $185,000 Ed 
Burke Memorial Futurity on Friday night at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridden by John Creager, Ah Sigh broke perfectly from the inside post position, 
immediately taking charge of the 350-yard race.The First Down Dash filly was 
never challenged, finishing nearly a length in front of runner-up The Fling 
King. Fruitstand Johnny, who was claimed for $6,250 in August, finished third.  
</P>
<P>
 Trained by Charlie Bloomquist for owner Frank Nakamura, Ah Sigh posted a 
winning time of 17.63 seconds, and paid $3.40, $2.80, and $2.20. Ah Sigh 
previously won the Miss Kindergarten Futurity and finished third in the 
Governor's Cup Futurity, making her one of the top 2-year-old fillies in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Creager, who is serving a suspension for an incident last weekend on Griswold, 
was given clearance to ride in the Ed Burke. Several fans were obviously still 
upset with Creager, jeering at the jockey as he returned to the winner's circle 
on Ah Sigh. STACY PIGOTT

NARITA BRIAN GOES AFTER JAPAN'S TRIPLE CROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Narita Brian has a shot at becoming the first winner of Japan's Triple Crown 
in a decade on Sunday when he runs in the $2.1-million Kikka-sho at Kyoto 
Racecourse. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-year-old son of 1988 Florida Derby winner Brian's Time already has won 
the first two races in the series -- the Satsuki-sho in April and the Japan 
Derby in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly feel pressure is building up on me," said Narita Brian's jockey, 
Katsumi Minai. 
</P>
<P>
 Narita Brian set a course record of 1:59 over the 1 1/4-mile grass course in 
the Satsuki-sho, and won the 1 1/2-mile Derby by five lengths over Air Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
 But he raised some questions when he ran second to Star Man, another 
3-year-old colt, in the 1 3/8-mile Kyoto Shimbun-hai on Oct. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Star Man is among the 14 entered to challenge Narita Brian in the 1 7/8-mile 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Only four horses have won Japan's version of the Triple Crown, St. Lite in 
1941; Shinzan in 1964; Mr. C.B. in 1983 and Symboli Rudolph in 1984.

SANTA ANITA; BETTORS NEED A WAKE-UP CALL TO KEEP UP WITH 22-RACE CARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There will be no shortage of betting opportunities for horse racing fans 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the seven Breeders' Cup races from Churchill Downs, Oak Tree at Santa 
Anita will offer seven live races and eight simulcast races from Bay Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Breeders' Cup begins at 10:20 a.m., there will be two live races, 
with first post at 9:15 a.m. After the Breeders' Cup Classic, at about 2:05, 
there will be five more live races. 
</P>
<P>
 D'hallevant, who was denied a spot in the Breeders' Cup Sprint, is the 2-1 
favorite in the day's feature, the $75,000 Morvich Handicap at about 6 1/2 
furlongs on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
 With most of the big-name riders at Churchill Downs today, Aaron Gryder, who 
began his career in California and has become successful in the Midwest, 
returns to ride D'hallevant for trainer Ron McAnally. Gryder has three other 
mounts on the program. 
</P>
<P>
 A 4-year-old Ogygian colt, D'hallevant is more accomplished on the main track, 
but scored his only victory in seven starts on the turf at the distance of the 
Morvich. He has a victory and a second in three tries on the course. 
</P>
<P>
 Didyme, fresh from an easy victory over lesser competition, is the 5-2 second 
choice, and Winning Combo, who upset Breeders' Cup Mile contender Megan's 
Interco in an allowance race on Oct. 9, is 3-1. Chris Antley will ride Winning 
Combo for trainer Craig Lewis, who claimed the gelding for $80,000 for owner 
Rubin Brown on June 3. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the field, from the rail out, includes Geographe, who upset 
$80,000 claimers at 11-1 in his last start; Rotsaluck, Mr Impose and 
Portoferraio. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Surprises have been the rule rather than the exception during the last 10 
years in the $400,000 Yellow Ribbon Stakes, which will be run for the 18th time 
Sunday at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Only twice since 1985 -- Estrapade that year and Kostroma in 1991 -- has the 
favorite won the Grade I race, which goes at 1 1/4 miles on the turf. Possibly 
Perfect paid $35.20 when she won last year and other upsets have been provided 
by Plenty Of Grace, $114 in 1990; Delighter, $15.20 in 1988, and Carotene, 
$47.60 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 A field of 11 fillies and mares was entered Friday morning for this year's 
Yellow Ribbon and a case can be made for several of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Bobby Frankel, who won with Possibly Perfect, will send out an entry 
Sunday, both horses making their first starts in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Yenda, who has won two of five races, was a distant third behind Breeders' Cup 
Turf starters in the Turf Classic at Belmont Park last month. Corey Nakatani 
will ride her. Wandesta, who is shipping in from France, will be ridden by Pat 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Charlie Whittingham, who has won the Yellow Ribbon three times, will 
also have two representatives. Aube Indienne, who upset Corrazona in the Las 
Palmas, will be ridden by Kent Desormeaux and La Frontera, an improving 
3-year-old filly, will have Eddie Delahoussaye aboard. Whittingham's most 
recent victory in the race was with Estrapade in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrazona will try to bounce back after her disappointing effort in the Las 
Palmas. The other entrants are Freckling Shadows, Wende, Zoonaqua, Fondly 
Remembered, Chesa Plana and Magical Maiden, who returns a week after a 
successful turf debut in the Louis R. Rowan Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Viva El Capitan, a fan favorite who won 10 of his 12 starts at Santa Anita, 
has been retired and trainer Bob Baffert has given the 5-year-old gelding to 
jockey David Flores. 
</P>
<P>
 A winner of 13 his 21 starts, Viva El Capitan finished second as the favorite 
in Sunday's seventh race and, according to Baffert, took a bad step after 
passing the wire. 
</P>
<P>
 "He suffered a little injury in his (left front) sesamoid," said Baffert. "He 
did it when he switched leads past the wire. He's always had little aches and 
pains, but he just took a bad step." 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, who rode the gelding to many of his victories, will keep him at agent 
Tony Matos' farm. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll be a pleasure-riding horse for my two girls (Cinthya and Natalya)," 
Flores said. "He's very special to me. You have to take care of horses like 
that because he's given us so much." Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Fu Man Slew chipped a knee in the California Cup Sprint and his future is 
doubtful. . . . Sandpit, who is scheduled to make his next start in the Japan 
Cup on Nov. 27, worked seven furlongs in 1:25 3/5 Friday morning. The Oak Tree 
Invitational winner will be shipped to Japan Nov. 15 or 16. . . . Funeral 
services were held Friday for Beth Stepp, the wife of trainer Bill Stepp. She 
died of cancer on Tuesday at 46.

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; CLEMMONS' LATE KICK LIFTS KNIGHTS

<P>
 In hindsight, the coach said he should have gone for two. Instead, Orange 
Coach Dick Hill and the Panthers let Foothill off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
 Cody Clemmons' 21-yard field goal with 32 seconds remaining gave Foothill a 
15-14 victory over Orange in a Century League game Friday night in front of 
about 2,200 at Tustin High. 
</P>
<P>
 It clinched a share of the league title for Foothill, which can win it 
outright next week with a victory over El Modena. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill second-guessed himself after the loss, saying he should have ordered his 
team to attempt a two-point conversion after a 24-yard touchdown run by 
quarterback Andy Lauridsen gave Orange a 13-12 lead with 3:45 left. The 
Panthers kicked the extra point for a two-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should have gone for two," Hill said. "It would have been a good idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill (5-4, 4-0 in league), which won its fourth in a row and its 12th 
consecutive in league, drove 73 yards in seven plays to the Orange 7. Clemmons 
kicked the game-winner four plays later. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill, which trailed, 7-0, at halftime, dominated the second half. The 
Knights finished with 437 yards in total offense to 210 for Orange, but four 
Foothill turnovers, three of them inside the Orange 30, kept the Panthers (4-5, 
1-3) within striking distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill quarterback Tyler Lang completed 16 of 18 passes for a season-high 
238 yards and two touchdowns. Two of his passes were intercepted. Tramel 
Robinson rushed for a game-high 141 yards and caught seven passes.

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; VALENCIA HANDS WESTERN MORE THAN FIRST 
LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE TERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Western can forget the score -- a 24-7 loss to Valencia in an Orange League 
game that knocked the Pioneers from the unbeaten ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 The bigger loss Friday at Western High was quarterback Dean Chambers, who 
sustained a right knee injury in the first half that took him out of the game, 
and perhaps the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Chambers, who was hit on the side of the knee as he made his final completion, 
was wearing a splint as he watched the second half from the sideline. He was 
able to walk back to the locker room without help after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 X-rays will determine the extent of the damage.  
</P>
<P>
 "He said he was hit late," said Pioneer Coach Jim Howell. "It's either a very 
bad strain or a possible tear, I don't know for sure. He had a similar injury 
to his other knee last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia Coach Mike Marrujo did not want to see Chambers hurt but still could 
not contain his excitement. In throwing an extra large monkey wrench into the 
league race, Valencia (3-5-1, 2-1-1) can still recover from forfeiting three 
games for using an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the best, most complete game we've played all season," said Marrujo, 
whose team has been in the playoffs 15 consecutive years. "We can still be 
league champs. We're going to Brea-Olinda next week and will give it our best 
shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia did it by shutting out Western (7-1-1, 2-1-1), 17-0, in the second 
half because the Pioneers offense -- struggling without Chambers -- was in 
disarray. 
</P>
<P>
 Replacement quarterbacks Vince Branstetter and Chris Oropeza did not complete 
a second-half pass to their teammates but did combine for three interceptions, 
two going to Joe Secoda. 
</P>
<P>
 Secoda also contributed an eight-yard touchdown pass to Jermaine Gray, a 
three-yard scoring run, and a 34-yard field goal in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 With so much at stake -- Western wanting to prove its worthiness after 
cracking the county Top 10 this week, Valencia desperate to maintain some 
meaning to its season -- no one expected a high-scoring affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Western, however, was vulnerable defensively; starters Hector Escobar, Damian 
Guerrero and Eddie Corral were out with injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had been lucky in regards to injuries all season, and then it hit us all 
at once," Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Things were tight in the first half. Both teams swapped six-play scoring 
drives in the second quarter, the Tigers going 61 yards, capped by Secoda's 
two-yard run, and the Pioneers' 73-yard journey ending on a three-yard run by 
Josh Burdett.

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; SAID, SANTANA HELP PUSH EL MODENA PAST 
SANTA ANA VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jason Said rushed for 114 yards to lead El Modena to a 21-6 victory over Santa 
Ana Valley Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Said didn't score, he kept three second-quarter scoring drives alive 
with long runs on third down.The Vanguards (3-6, 1-3 in Century League) gained 
275 yards on the ground against the Falcons (3-6, 1-3). Sophomore Aaron Santana 
rushed 16 times for 87 yards and quarterback Jeremy Seltzer carried five times 
for 50 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Modena defense shut down Santa Ana Valley's rushing attack, holding two 
runners to 70 yards. Kyle Marks, who started in place of injured leading rusher 
Dwayne Cherrington, was limited to 21 rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way we're supposed to play defense," El Modena Coach Steve Howard 
said. "But they can't be the same team without Cherrington. That's a hard loss 
to overcome." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vanguards scored their three touchdowns in the second quarter. Santana's 
one-yard and two-yard touchdown runs gave El Modena a 14-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley fumbled on its next possession deep in its territory and El 
Modena took advantage when Seltzer scored on a 25-yard quarterback draw. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons made it 21-6 when Jason Parrett picked up a fumble at the El 
Modena 20 and raced 80 yards for the score on the last play of the third 
quarter.

</P>
<P>
 But not before the Rangers could withstand a frantic comeback by the 
Musketeers (7-2, 2-1 in league play), who trailed, 29-7 and 36-13, before 
rallying for 20 fourth-quarter points. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallan Rigby, Nordhoff's other running back, stole the show. He ran for two 
touchdowns, threw a touchdown pass, passed for a first down on a fake punt and 
kicked a a key 47-yard punt in the second quarter that led to a turnover. 
</P>
<P>
 That turnover led to Rigby's second touchdown -- and a permanent lead for the 
Rangers (6-3, 3-0). 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the championship," Rigby said. "This is the game. Josh (Hawkins) had 
a helluva game. But they were keying on him, so I had to step up." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins began the night as the region's top Southern Section rusher with 1,302 
yards. Moorpark's Bryan Wilkins wasn't far behind with 1,187 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins won the personal battle, with 157 yards and a touchdown in 27 carries. 
Wilkins finished with 117 in 24 carries and five receptions for 45 yards. 
Wilkins did not score a touchdown -- in part because Hawkins, playing defense, 
three times threw him for losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, Nordhoff avenged a 27-21 loss to Moorpark in last year's 
league title game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took it personally when they beat us last year," Hawkins said. "The whole 
thing was about revenge. We knew we could stop Wilkins. I had fun. It was all 
emotional. I wanted this bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins opened a wild second half with 14-yard touchdown run. Then Nordhoff 
Coach Cliff Farrar got a big play from his son, Russell, who intercepted a 
deflected pass and rambled 45 yards for a touchdown. When the Rangers' Mike 
Sheets kicked a 42-yard field goal, Nordhoff took a 29-7 advantage into the 
final period. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark quarterback Bryan Paul rallied his team with touchdown runs of 14 and 
16 yards and an 11-yard scoring pass to Mike Williams in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rigby, who accounted for 63 yards rushing and 62 yards passing, spoiled 
the comeback when he threw a 42-yard touchdown bomb to Tony Henney from his 
halfback position. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I would contribute, but never like this," Rigby said. "This is a 
dream come true."

CARR DRIVES BUENA PAST OXNARD, 24-20 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Who says quarterbacks are supposed to throw the ball? Or even hand it off? 
</P>
<P>
 It was on the feet of a quarterback that Buena High beat Oxnard, 24-20, in a 
key Channel League game Friday night. And it was almost on the feet of another 
quarterback that Buena nearly lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs' Chris Carr, who lined up at quarterback sporadically throughout 
the game, scored on a one-yard plunge with 1:21 left, giving Buena its first 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Carr, who gained 104 yards in 11 carries, mostly at quarterback, was smiling 
at the end but his team was nearly outperformed by Oxnard quarterback Taj 
Lewis, who ran for 129 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena (6-1-2 overall, 4-0-2) has a chance to win the league title with a 
victory at San Marcos next week. San Marcos lost to Dos Pueblos Friday night 
and fell to 4-2 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard (5-4, 4-2), which led, 20-3, at halftime, had a chance to put the game 
away in the fourth quarter when the Yellowjackets drove deep into Buena 
territory with a 20-18 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis threw a 10 yard touchdown pass to Ross Randolph on fourth and nine, but 
the play was nullified because of an illegal receiver downfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Coach Neil Kazmierezak elected to go for the touchdown on the next play 
from the 15, but Lewis' pass fell incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Buena drove 85 yards for the game-winning touchdown, 52 yards coming on a 
run by Carr. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard's last-ditch possession ended when a fourth-down shotgun snap sailed 
over the head of Lewis, who was not expecting the ball, and was recovered by 
Buena's Bobby Sentinella at the Oxnard 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena quarterback Glenn Dudley, who took most of the snaps, completed nine of 
16 passes for 116 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis completed three of 10 for 16 yards, doing most of the damage with his 
feet, particularly in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-11 senior gained 130 yards in the first half and scored on runs of 11 
and 23 yards. He finished the second scoring run by high-stepping into the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis was at his best when able to ad-lib, as he did on fourth and seven from 
the Buena 22 in the closing seconds of the first half. Lewis, lined up in the 
shotgun, dropped the snap but picked up the ball and squirted through Buena's 
defense for a 20-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard took the lead on Gabe Roman's 63-yard interception return in the first 
quarter. Buena had a chance to take the lead in the second quarter, but a 
10-yard scoring pass from Dudley to Josh Frost was called back because of a 
holding penalty. The Bulldogs had to settle for a 32-yard field goal by James 
Hammer. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena has not lost since a 38-7 setback to Westlake in its season opener.

NO. 1 BISHOP AMAT DOWNS CRESPI, 28-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The team is ranked No. 1 in the nation. Maybe the tailback should be, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Daylon McCutcheon, whose father, Lawrence, played running back for the 
Rams, appeared every bit the Division I prospect he is proclaimed to be as 
Bishop Amat High trounced Crespi, 28-6, in a Del Rey League game Friday night 
at Bishop Amat. 
</P>
<P>
 McCutcheon rushed for three touchdowns and caught a touchdown pass while 
piling up 260 total yards. He rushed for 189 yards in 19 carries, including 
scoring runs of 12, 76 and seven yards. He caught two passes for 71 yards, 
including a 43-yard touchdown pass play. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Amat (9-0, 4-0 in league play), ranked No. 1 nationally by at least one 
publication, did the rest with defense, checking Crespi's emotion-filled 
offensive drives and sacking Celt quarterback Dave Lins right out of his shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory assured Bishop Amat of at least a share of the league title. 
Crespi (5-4, 3-1) remains in second place. 
</P>
<P>
 Lins fared well, considering the savage pass rush he faced. He completed 21 of 
39 for 158 yards. But he was sacked six times for minus-44 yards and emerged 
from one pileup doubled over in pain and his shoe untied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bit my tongue, I chipped my tooth," Lins said. "But that's football. 
They're a great team. I mean, No. 1 in the nation. And that tailback is 
awesome." 
</P>
<P>
 There is little doubt that McCutcheon (5 feet 11, 185 pounds) is headed 
somewhere after high school. Every time he touched the ball he was in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 He opened the scoring with a 12-yard run on his second carry.  
</P>
<P>
 Six minutes later, he caught a swing pass from quarterback James Free and was 
off and running again, going 43 yards for a score that gave the Lancers a 14-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the second quarter, McCutcheon made an interception in the end zone. 
Four plays later, he took a handoff and ran 76 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been able to make the big play all year," McCutcheon said. "They held 
us on some plays. But after a while, we're gonna break one." 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Jamian Barbour was a bright spot for Crespi, rushing for 121 yards in 
13 carries, including a 42-yard burst for a touchdown in the third quarter to 
narrow the Lancers' lead to 21-6. 
</P>
<P>
 McCutcheon, who sat out most of the second and fourth quarters, countered by 
leading Bishop Amat on a 10-play, 69-yard drive.  
</P>
<P>
 He carried seven times for 36 yards, including a seven-yard sweep for the 
score. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're a great football team," Crespi Coach Tim Lins said. "They 
didn't do anything we didn't expect. My goodness, I think we did pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Jeff DeFinney led Crespi with nine catches for 56 yards. Wayne 
Emerson added six receptions for 39 yards, and Marcos Solorzano had five for 47 
yards.

NORTHRIDGE, MASTER'S PLAY 120 MINUTES FOR NOTHING; SOCCER: FOR THE MUSTANGS, 
SCORELESS TIE WITH THE MATADORS FEELS ALMOST LIKE A VICTORY.

<P>
 Two coaches, standing fewer than 15 yards from each other, with entirely 
different perspectives on the same game. 
</P>
<P>
 Both using f-words to describe the experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Jim Rickard of The Master's College, whose team is bound for the NAIA 
playoffs, said he had "fun" watching his team forge a 0-0 standoff Friday night 
against Cal State Northridge in a nonconference soccer match at North Campus 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Marwan Ass'ad didn't enjoy what he saw. "Frustrating, man," he said. 
"Frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (7-8-1) took 27 shots. Six were stopped by Master's goalies. Most 
of the others went high, wide -- or both. One, off the foot of Steven 
Faggiolly, was so tantalizingly close -- off the crossbar -- with about two 
minutes left in the final of two extra periods. 
</P>
<P>
 And so the trend continues. Northridge, which concludes its season at home 
today at 4 p.m. against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, has been shut out in its last 
eight matches. The Matadors' last goal came Oct. 2 during a 5-0 victory over 
Loyola Marymount. Their last goal during a home game came Sept. 18 during a 3-2 
loss to UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope we win tomorrow," Ass'ad said. "If we finish .500, hopefully 
everybody will forget about this season."

ARELLANES FINDING A LOT TO SMILE ABOUT AT VALLEY; JC FOOTBALL: TRANSFER 
QUARTERBACK BECOMES WSC'S LEADING PASSER FOR UNDEFEATED MONARCHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every chance he gets, Jim Arellanes laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell him a silly little story and he breaks up. Throw a marginally amusing 
anecdote his way and there he goes again. Crack a joke and, well, forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the contagious glee of someone basking in life's sunny side. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes has gone from near-neglect at Northern Arizona, where he redshirted 
one season and played infrequently the next, to overnight stardom at Valley 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, yeah. It's been good, definitely," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two months, Arellanes has been one of the top quarterbacks in the 
state and the catalyst of the nationally ranked Valley team that is bidding for 
an unbeaten season. 
</P>
<P>
 He has shredded opposing defenses by executing the run-and-shoot -- an offense 
unfamiliar to him until this season -- with remarkable precision. 
</P>
<P>
 After seven games, Arellanes leads the Western State Conference with 2,082 
yards passing, 17 touchdowns and a 61.4% completion rate (143 of 233). He 
averages 297.4 yards passing and with three conference games remaining and an 
anticipated bowl appearance, Arellanes is on track to surpass the school 
single-season mark of 3,134 yards passing set last year by Sean Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
 But before he even begins to think about that, Arellanes has more pressing 
matters at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs (7-0 overall and in the WSC), ranked fourth in California and 
ninth in the country by USA Today, will face their stiffest test tonight at 7 
when they play host to Bakersfield (6-1, 5-1), ranked ninth in the state and 
17th in the nation. Each is 3-0 in South Division games and the outcome 
probably will determine the division champion. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be the first encounter with Bakersfield for Arellanes (6 feet 4, 212 
pounds), yet he claims not to feel any added pressure even though the Renegades 
are two-time defending division champions and a traditional power. Valley, in 
fact, has a 12-game losing streak against Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know what we can do," Arellanes said. "We have an attitude that nobody can 
stop us if we execute." 
</P>
<P>
 Many have tried to halt Arellanes and the Monarchs this year but none have 
succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Santa Barbara, for instance, in the opener. Arellanes riddled the 
Vaqueros for 402 yards passing and three touchdowns in a 41-24 victory. Against 
Hancock three weeks later, he threw for 340 yards and two touchdowns in a 36-25 
victory. Later, in a 28-14 victory over Moorpark, Arellanes was 29 of 51 for 
379 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes has been so consistent that he didn't threw an interception until 
the fifth game and more than 130 pass attempts. Altogether, he has been picked 
off three times. 
</P>
<P>
 "We provided an opportunity and he has worked hard," said Jim Fenwick, the 
Valley coach. "He has been a gem as far as coaching because he is willing to 
learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Always a quick study who excelled in football, basketball and baseball at El 
Rancho High in Pico Rivera, Arellanes accepted a scholarship to Northern 
Arizona in 1991 after passing for 1,545 yards and 13 touchdowns his senior 
season. But he soon realized Flagstaff was not for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they recruited me, they said I would have an opportunity to start," 
Arellanes said. 
</P>
<P>
 But that turned out not to be the case. When senior John Bonds was injured 
last season, freshman Jeff Lewis became the starter ahead of Arellanes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would be best for me to go elsewhere," Arellanes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes transferred to Valley after Steve Axman, the Northern Arizona coach, 
recommended him to Fenwick. In his first few spring practices, Arellanes 
wondered whether he would adjust to the run-and-shoot quick enough to battle 
Davis Delmatoff for the starting position. At El Rancho, Arellanes had worked 
from the wing-T formation and Delmatoff, who transferred from Pierce after 
passing for 1,961 yards last season, knew the run-and-shoot well from his days 
at Hart High. 
</P>
<P>
 To compound things, people compared him to Fitzgerald, the former Agoura High 
quarterback now at Pittsburgh. Fitzgerald led the Monarchs to a 9-2 record and 
a last-second, 21-19 victory over Moorpark in the Western State K-Swiss Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of got to the point where there was a little bit of pressure," 
Arellanes said. "Everyone thought everything would be like last year, without 
missing a beat." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, it has turned out better than than. 
</P>
<P>
 "He puts the ball basically where the defensive back is not going to catch 
it," said Brian Comer, the school's career leader in receptions with 107. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes hopes that his play will earn him another shot at a Division I 
program. He says Memphis is pursuing him and that other schools have shown 
interest. His goal is to move on after the season, like Fitzgerald did last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping I could come in here and put up the good numbers," Arellanes 
said. "I thought there would be attention here from recruiters because of 
Sean." 
</P>
<P>
 There is, and that's reason for Arellanes to laugh some more.

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; SEA VIEW LEAGUE; JARRETT TAKES THREE 
TIPS TO GET EL TORO A VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 El Toro's Jason Jarrett knew it was possible to win a game on a last-second 
desperation pass, but he just didn't believe it was possible Friday night with 
El Toro trailing Woodbridge and the ball sitting at the Chargers' 37 yard-line 
with 10 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarrett became a believer after he caught a pass from Brian Wilson that had 
been tipped three times and raced the final 15 yards to give El Toro a 30-28 
victory in a Sea View League game at Trabuco Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaches diagramed the play before we went in and told me to wait for the 
tip," Jarrett said. "But I thought, 'This can't happen.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The play was the perfect ending for a game that featured big and wild plays. 
</P>
<P>
 After El Toro took a 14-0 lead, an advantage Charger Coach Mike Milner said he 
hoped would "take the life out of them." Woodbridge didn't roll over and give 
up, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge's Carl Howard ran 33 yards on a reverse to pull the Warriors to 
within seven. And they tied the score after John Meineke returned an El Toro 
fumble to the two and Casey Harris snuck in for the touchdown two plays later. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers appeared to put the game out of reach when Jamie Hanaway ran 19 
yards for the touchdown. Woodbridge again bounced right back, however, when 
Theo Wakefield ran 56 yards on the Warriors' first play from scrimmage to make 
it 24-21. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge then took the lead when an El Toro punt was batted the ball into 
the hands of Nate Perrizo who ran 56 yards untouched to make the score 28-24.

 J.C. Pintsak threw for three touchdowns and 145 yards to lead visiting Trabuco 
Hills to a 34-10 victory over host San Clemente Friday night in a South Coast 
League game. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills shuffled its quarterbacks, Pintsak and Chad Collins, on every 
play, keeping the Tritons off balance all night.Collins connected on four of 
six passes for 80 yards and one touchdown. The Mustangs had 225 yards passing 
in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Pintsak came out throwing on his first possession, connecting with Laquent 
Fobbs on a 65-yard pass for a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Pintsak went to the air again on the Mustangs' third series, connecting on key 
passes to Jake Anderson. A 15-yard slant pass across the middle to Anderson set 
up Trabuco Hills' next score. DeSha Runnels' one-yard plunge put Trabuco Hills 
ahead, 14-0, with 3 minutes 45 seconds remaining in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente made the score 14-7 seconds before the end of the quarter on a 
four-yard run by Trevor Insley. The Tritons' 13-play, 84-yard scoring drive was 
led by Keith Gros' 45 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills' Pintsak found Fobbs for his second touchdown of the night, a 
19-yard pass play for a 20-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Fobbs caught a game-high 101 yards, averaging nearly 34 yards for his three 
receptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Pintsak and Collins each threw for touchdowns in the third quarter to put 
Trabuco Hills ahead, 34-10. Pintsak connected with Brian Flourney from 24 
yards, while Anderson and Collins teamed up on a 21-yard play. RICK CHRISTOPHER

 It took exactly 5 minutes 13 seconds for Capistrano Valley to begin thinking

 Capistrano Valley (5-4, 2-1) plays at Trabuco Hills Thursday in the South 
Coast League finale. The game has Division I playoff implications for both 
teams. Mater Dei, which plays Dana Hills (0-9, 0-4) next week, is the league 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every game counts but that one really counts," Cougar Coach Eric Patton said. 
"It's a tough way to end the (regular) season, but that's the way it should be. 
We've got to beat Trabuco to make the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley needed only eight carries by sophomore tailback Malaefou 
MacKenzie, who gained 185 yards and scored on runs of 73, 18 and 26 yards, to 
defeat the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougar defense sacked Dana Hills quarterback Scott Maynard eight times for 
minus-64 yards and allowed the Dolphins 101 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only highlight for the Dolphins was two blocked punts by Kory Seitz. 
Both times Dana Hills had the ball in good scoring position -- at the Cougar 12 
and 8 -- but failed to score until two minutes remained in the game on a 
10-yard pass from Maynard. MICHAEL CASEY

28-0 lead with 1 minute 27 seconds left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart increased its lead to 35-0 when J.B. Nelson returned the second half 
kickoff 93 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Burroughs (2-7, 0-3) scored on a 16-yard pass play from quarterback Mike 
Barrett to wide receiver Scott Boldvich with 2:47 left in the third quarter.

passes for 220 yards, 171 in the second half.

Waddell on a 19-yard pass play with 4:19 left in the first quarter.

GRANADA HILLS TAKES ADVANTAGE OF MISTAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 One week after a disappointing tie, the Granada Hills High football team 
solidified its chances for a City Section 4-A Division playoff berth with a 
24-12 victory over Cleveland in a Northwest Valley Conference game Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gives Granada Hills a 4-1-1 record in conference play (5-3-1 
overall) and erases several doubts after the Highlanders tied Birmingham last 
week. The tie made Granada Hills Coach Tom Harp think about having to possibly 
prepare his team for the 3-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we definitely have a shot at the 4-A now," Harp said. "We're going to 
need another good solid game next week, but we are definitely looking for the 
4-A." 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills quarterback Brian MacLean, the leading passer in the area, 
completed 11 of 17 passes for 147 yards, but only two completions were longer 
than 13 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland emphasized stopping MacLean and the passing attack, which opened 
holes for running back Eric Richardson, who gained a season-high 101 yards in 
13 carries and scored on a 23-yard run on the Highlanders' first possession. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were pretty steady all night, it wasn't anything spectacular," MacLean 
said. "We were able to move the ball by both running and passing. It kept us in 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland (4-5, 3-3) stayed close to the Highlanders, but several mistakes in 
critical situations, including two unsuccessful fourth-down plays, sealed the 
Cavaliers' fate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders took a 14-0 lead early in the second quarter on a 57-yard, 
eight-play drive that was capped by MacLean's seven-yard pass to Eric 
Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland mounted a 15-play drive that took eight minutes but failed on a 
fourth-down play deep in Granada Hills territory just before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland did come back with two scores in the second half. After Granada 
Hills added a field goal, quarterback Johnny Lopez (six of 15, 95 yards) 
connected with Alex Kalinowski (five receptions, 83 yards) on a 27-yard scoring 
pass to cut the lead to 17-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland's Junior Brignac connected with Russell Burwell on a 59-yard 
touchdown pass play on the final play.

 Royal 14, Thousand Oaks 12 -- Royal scored on a 65-yard pass play from Wes 
Lagatta to Brendan Gibson on the game's first play and held off a rally by host 
Thousand Oaks. Thousand Oaks (3-5, 2-4) drove deep into Royal territory on 
seven of its 10 possessions, but could not score until midway through the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>

Sperry scored on a 10-yard sweep one play later to cut Royal's lead to 14-6. 
The point-after attempt sailed wide left. 
</P>
<P>
 Read sacked Lagatta on the next series, forcing a Highlander punt. Sophomore 
quarterback Scott McEwan marched Thousand Oaks 74 yards in five plays, capped 
by a 45-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Eric Allen with 3:35 to play. The 
conversion pass failed, and Royal ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Lagatta connected on six of nine passes for 180 yards. Gibson had four catches 
for 107 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Ange caught three passes for 100 yards for Thousand Oaks. Sperry

 Jude Reyes made a 36-yard field goal with three minutes left in the half for 
Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>

adding a two-point conversion with 3:33 left in the third quarter, reducing the

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; ARMENDARIZ'S TOUCHDOWN, INTERCEPTION 
SPARK CENTURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes you can't tell a player with a program. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Zeke Armendariz, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 There was No. 53 for Century scoring a touchdown on a fumble recovery and 
intercepting a pass to pace the Centurions (5-4, 3-1) to a 17-7 victory over 
Katella (0-9, 0-4) Friday night in Empire League play at Glover Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 This sets up an Empire League title showdown next week, when Century plays 
Kennedy and El Dorado plays Loara. All four teams are 3-1 in league. 
</P>
<P>
 The program had No. 53 as Carlos Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Brown, Century's coach, said, "That roster was from an old program." 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no mistaking Armendariz's contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-2, 203-pound senior linebacker picked up a fumble by Katella's 
Willie Demyers and ran 21 yards to give Century a 14-7 lead with 6 minutes 47 
seconds left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Armendariz intercepted a Sal Viramontes pass with 6:02 left in the game. It 
was one of seven turnovers for Katella on the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some teams are like that," Brown said. "That's been the story of their 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 Viramontes scored on a two-yard run with 51 seconds left in the first quarter 
for Katella. Baltazar Vega set up the touchdown with a 59-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Century tied the score in the second quarter on an 18-yard touchdown pass from 
Stanley Villanueva to Ignacio Vega. Vega also kicked a 17-yard field goal in 
the fourth quarter. RUSSELL BANKS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trailing, 10-0, Notre Dame got some big help from the shortest guy on the 
Knights' roster -- Corey Franzini. 
</P>
<P>
 Franzini, a 5-foot-5 senior defensive back, intercepted two of Jason Brennan's 
passes in the second quarter to set up two touchdowns and help the Knights to a 
28-10 Mission League victory over Bishop Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame plays host to Chaminade next Friday night with the league title on 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan completed 25 of 52 passes for 298 yards, but he threw four 
interceptions and was sacked six times. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame's John Garcia rushed for 152 yards in 24 carries and scored on a 
four-yard run following Franzini's first interception. Garcia also scored on a 
12-yard run late in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame took a 14-10 lead with 30 seconds left in the half when Ryan Bowne 
hit Troy Garner with a 13-yard pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowne, who completed 10 of 16 passes for 92 yards, connected with Robbie 
Brewster on a 16-yard scoring pass play to give the Knights a 21-10 lead in the 
third quarter. Brewster caught six passes for 74 yards and had Notre Dame's 
other two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Montgomery's Omar Smith caught 12 passes for 141 yards. BRIAN CHALEW

<P>
 Three interceptions and Chris Ryan's 42-yard return of a blocked punt for a 
touchdown sparked Ventura High to a 31-16 Channel League victory over Santa 
Barbara on Friday night at Ventura, keeping the Cougars' playoff hopes alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan's return midway through the first quarter was set up when Donell Wickett 
blocked a punt on the Dons' opening possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt White's 36-yard field goal with 9:33 left in the second quarter gave 
Ventura (4-5, 4-2 in league play) a 10-0 halftime lead. On the first play of 
the third quarter, Oscar Tovar's interception and 22-yard return set up Brian 
Bushnell's 10-yard score to extend the lead to 17-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the quarter, Eric Olson intercepted a pass and returned it 36 yards 
to set up a one-yard scoring run by Aaron Davis. Eric Blair added a 25-yard 
scoring run in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons (5-3-1, 3-2-1) rushed for only 16 yards. LANCE O'FALLON

SOUTHERN SECTION FOOTBALL ROUNDUP; QUARTZ HILL GOES FOR IT, FALLS SHORT

<TEXT>
<P>
 With three seconds to play Coach John Albee said he never considered kicking a 
field goal that would have given Quartz Hill High a tie and retained second 
place in the Golden League. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he called a pass play that failed when quarterback Damien Kendrid 
tripped over his own blocker as time expired, and the Rebels fell to Ridgecrest 
Burroughs, 23-20, Friday night at Quartz Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss dropped the Rebels (5-2-2, 2-1-1 in league play) into third place and 
eliminated them from title contention. 
</P>
<P>
 Kendrid drove the Rebels 63 yards in seven plays, aided by a pass-interference 
penalty that gave Quartz Hill a first-and-goal at the Burroughs nine-yard line 
with three seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Demario Brown finished with 195 yards in 32 carries and scored on a pair of 
four-yard runs for Burroughs (6-3, 3-1). 
</P>
<P>
 With the Rebels trailing, 16-13, late in the third quarter, Kendrid put 
together a 12-play, 76-yard drive, capped off by a 14-yard touchdown pass to 
James Welch that gave Quartz Hill a 20-16 lead with four minutes to play.

 Quarterback Greg Marquez controlled the first half, and sophomore running back 
Tyrone Morgan sparked Sylmar High in the second half as the Spartans pounded 
North Hollywood, 55-18, in a Valley Pac-8 Conference game Friday night at 
Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar, playing without four suspended defensive starters, registered seven 
sacks.The 18 points Sylmar allowed is a season high. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquez threw first-half touchdown passes to four receivers. He connected with 
Durell Price for a 57-yard touchdown on the Spartans' second play from 
scrimmage and fired a 27-yarder to Galdino Cortes on the team's second 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquez also threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Mike Cervantes and added a 
31-yard scoring pass play to Kevin Brown as Sylmar (9-0, 6-0) built a 27-6 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquez completed seven of 13 for 165 yards with one interception. 
</P>
<P>

six carries, all in the second half. Sylmar finished with 458 yards, 293 coming 
on the ground. 
</P>
<P>

VERDUGO HILLS SEES RED IN VICTORY OVER LINCOLN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DESMOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buzz Johnson has had a tough time as football coach at Verdugo Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons had not won a football game since last season's finale, and earlier 
this week he announced his resignation, effective after next week's final game 
against Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm basically doing it for health purposes and personal reasons," said 
Johnson, after he watched his team defeat Lincoln, 20-14, Friday in a Northern 
Conference game at Verdugo Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who has a 5-22-3 record in three seasons, may have borrowed from the 
Notre Dame handbook to inspire the Dons (1-6-2, 1-4-1 in conference play), when 
his team took the field in new red jerseys for their homecoming game. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it was the effort of an unlikely contributor that really ignited 
Verdugo Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Verdugo Hills trailed, 7-6, early in the fourth quarter when Casey Thompson 
intercepted Adrian Pulido's pass and returned it 36 yards for a touchdown. 
Thompson, normally a receiver, hadn't played in the defensive backfield since 
last season on the junior varsity. Injuries to two regulars earlier in the game 
led to the switch. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback David Kelly followed Thompson's touchdown with a two-point 
conversion on a sneak over left tackle, giving the Dons a 14-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly completed five of nine passes for 106 yards, including a 12-yard 
touchdown to Ryan Brouchett late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Evans gained 71 yards in 13 carries for the Dons, and Jon Marino added a 
16-yard scoring run as fourth-quarter insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Verdugo Hills needed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido, who completed 13 of 18 passes for 176 yards and two touchdowns for 
Lincoln (2-7, 2-4), connected with Jose Guevara for a 16-yard touchdown pass 
with 1 minute 50 seconds left.

CROSS-COUNTRY / MARMONTE LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIPS; HERNANDEZ RACES TO BOYS' TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't get Eleazar Hernandez of Camarillo High wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 He takes a lot of pride in being one of the top cross-country runners in the 
state, but he doesn't view his opponents as bitter rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 As Camarillo Coach Mike Smith says, "the thrill of the battle is what Eleazar 
loves more than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Even more than winning itself. 
</P>
<P>
 That was evident after Hernandez won the boys' race of the Marmonte League 
finals at Moorpark College on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 While well-wishers congratulated Hernandez on bouncing back from last week's 
loss to Keith O'Doherty of Thousand Oaks in the Ventura County championships, 
he was surprised by all the hoopla. 
</P>
<P>
 And when reporters asked him if it was important to have beaten O'Doherty for 
the fourth time in five races this season, he said simply, "Not really. I just 
wanted to run hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Running hard meant coming through the first mile in 5 minutes 2 seconds with 
O'Doherty and Jeff Fischer of Thousand Oaks, John Greene of Agoura and 
Francisco Sandoval of Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval fell off the pace soon after and Hernandez picked up the pace after 
he led O'Doherty, Greene and Fischer through two miles in 10:11. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to try and get away from them right after two miles," Hernandez 
said. "I didn't want it to come down to a kick like last week." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't as Hernandez had a 10-meter lead on Greene -- who had another 10 
meters on O'Doherty -- with a half-mile left. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez gradually increased his advantage as he became the first Camarillo 
runner to win a Marmonte League boys' title since Abe Valdez in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 His time of 14:55 was a course record for three miles, lowering the previous 
best of 15:00 set by Thousand Oaks' Brandon Del Campo last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene, who missed the county meet because of a sore knee, ran his best race 
of the season to place second in 15:00. O'Doherty (15:03), Fischer (15:19) and 
Sandoval (15:33) followed. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks, the No. 5-ranked team in The Harrier magazine's national poll, 
placed five runners among the top nine finishers to total 30 points and win its 
third consecutive team title. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo, ranked third in the state Division I poll, placed second with 45, 
followed by Agoura (72), Channel Islands (99) and Newbury Park (119). 
</P>
<P>
 In the girls' race, Agoura's Amy Skieresz won her third consecutive individual 
title and Thousand Oaks won its first team championship since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Skieresz, the defending State Division I champion, shared the lead with Kim 
Mortensen of Thousand Oaks for the first mile (5:59) before opening up a 
nine-second advantage at two miles (12:01). 
</P>
<P>
 She finished in 17:41, followed by Mortensen at 17:56. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks, paced by Mortensen, placed six runners among the top 10 
finishers to total 27 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura, the four-time defending league champion, finished second with 62 
points, followed by Simi Valley (72), Camarillo (96) and Westlake (119).

<P>
 It was the Bradley Lisotto show Friday night as the senior tailback scored 
three touchdowns to lead No. 5 Edison to a 34-7 Sunset League victory over host 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisotto caught two touchdown passes and rushed for one as the Chargers (7-2, 
2-2) moved into a three-way tie with Marina and Fountain Valley for third place 
in league. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison will face Marina next week in the final regular season game, and 
Fountain Valley will take on top-ranked Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers came out strong on their first drive, picking up five first downs 
and moving the ball 72 yards in two minutes. Quarterback Patrick Markovsky 
tossed a short pass to Lisotto, who weaved his way around defenders for a 
14-yard touchdown play with 9 minutes 58 seconds left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison's defense then took over, holding the Oilers (1-8, 0-4) to 147 yards 
total offense and sacking James Bartusick six times. 
</P>
<P>
 After senior Kevin Bever kicked a 31-yard field goal midway through the first 
quarter, Lisotto took off again. After a 25-yard run, Lisotto then caught a 
31-yard scoring pass from Markovsky to give the Chargers a 17-0 lead with 2:23 
left in the first. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers' only score came when defensive back Brenton Wood blocked a Bever 
punt and Huntington Beach was able to move the ball 37 yards. Bartusick threw 
12 yards to wide receiver Dennis Masuda for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison began the second half just like the first. Defensive end Marcus Emhof 
recovered a Jason Locklin fumble on the Oilers' 35-yard line. and six plays 
later Lisotto scored his final touchdown on a 20-yard run. Lisotto finished 105 
yards on 17 carries and eight catches for 99 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers scored twice in the fourth quarter. Bryan Lachapelle blocked a 
42-yard field goal attempt by Bartusick, and the Chargers drove 57 yards for a 
touchdown, Markovsky's one-yard run with 8:42 remaining. Bever then padded the 
score with a 45-yard field goal with 6:39 left.

PREP EXTRA: SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; UNIVERSITY FORCES COSTA MESA TO SETTLE 
FOR A 30-30 TIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Junior Brian Reeves caught a one-yard touchdown pass from Ryan Taylor with six 
seconds left, allowing Costa Mesa to tie University, 30-30, Friday night at 
Irvine High School. 
</P>
<P>
 University defensive tackle Justin Overdebest stopped Charles Chatman, who 
tried to run for the conversion, to prevent the Mustangs from winning. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatman led Costa Mesa (7-1-1, 3-0-1) with 340 yards in 35 carries. But the 
Mustangs, ranked third in Division VIII, had three costly fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatman's one-yard touchdown run with 33 seconds left in the third quarter 
closed the University lead to 30-22. Taylor connected with Josh Schroeder on a 
two-point conversion pass to trail, 30-24. 
</P>
<P>
 University (4-1-1, 2-1-1) was led by its special teams, which scored two 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first play of the game, Costa Mesa's Joey Archuletta fumbled on the 
kickoff. Gene Paleo grabbed the ball in the air and returned it 26 yards for a 
touchdown and a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatman's six-yard touchdown run -- and a two-point conversion run -- with 9 
minutes 12 seconds left in the first quarter gave Costa Mesa an 8-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But University moved ahead, 10-8, on Charles Thompson's 21-yard field goal 
with 4:12 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 University took the lead, 16-8, on Tucker Highfield's six-yard touchdown run 
with 2:45 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 University led, 30-16, when Fred Roberts blocked a punt and Stephen McKee 
recovered the ball and returned it 23 yards for a touchdown with 1:08 in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 On the play, Costa Mesa lineman Jason Morin suffered a concussion. After a 
25-minute delay, he was taken to Western Medical Center in Santa Ana. He is 
listed in serious but stable condition, nursing supervisor Thelma Myers said.

 Tommy Summers rushed for three touchdowns as Pacifica scored 39 first-half 
points en route to a 45-0 rout of La Quinta in Garden Grove League play Friday 
at Bolsa Grande High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Summers scored on runs of two, 16 and four yards as the Mariners (5-4, 3-2) 
scored touchdowns the first six times they touched the ball, including four 
offensive possessions and fumble recoveries by Donald Douglass and Jeff Burt. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica's defense held the Aztecs (1-8, 0-6) to minus-5 yards total offense 
in the first half and 64 yards total. La Quinta did not cross midfield until 
the Mariners fumbled a ball in their territory with less than one minute 
remaining in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica kept its playoff hopes alive with limited but effective use of its 
first-string attack. Ryan Johansen completed four of six passes for 84 yards -- 
including a 22-yard touchdown strike to Rich Campos late in the second quarter 
-- and did not attempt a pass in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Summers carried nine times for 93 yards before giving way to Eric Westlund, 
who took the Mariners the rest of the way with 85 yards in 17 carries. ANDY

 Los Amigos improved to 8-1 and clinched a playoff berth with a 33-6 victory 
over visiting Bolsa Grande Friday night at Garden Grove High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lobos, ranked eighth in Division VII, won their third consecutive game and 
can finish second in the Garden Grove League with a victory over Pacifica in 
the regular-season finale Thursday.Bolsa Grande (2-7, 1-4) fell from playoff 
contention with the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of junior running back Greg Fausto and senior quarterback Ape 
Tuato accounted for most of the Los Amigos offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Fausto gained 128 yards, scoring on runs of one, 23 and 22 yards and pushed 
his season totals to 1,090 yards rushing and 26 touchdowns. Tuato completed 
nine of 16 passes for 124 yards and ran six yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Amigos took a 7-0 lead when two Tuato completion moved the ball to the 
Matador one-yard line, and Fausto ran through the middle for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Amigos managed to build a 20-0 lead by halftime, thanks to Fausto's 
23-yard touchdown run around right end and a 6-yard scoring run by Tuato. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lobos increased their lead with a little razzle-dazzle in the third 
quarter. Facing fourth-and-24 at the Bolsa 32 after three consecutive 
negative-yardage plays, Tuato completed a pass to Warren Roberge near the right 
sideline at the Matador 22. Roberge flipped the ball to Fausto, who went the 
rest of the way for his third touchdown of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolsa Grande's only score came late in the third quarter when David Price 
found Mike Dalgleish alone over the middle for a 62-yard scoring play. ERIC

 Brendan McGraw rushed 17 times for 265 yards and six touchdowns in one half of 
work to propel Laguna Hills past visiting Laguna Beach, 48-14, in a Pacific 
Coast League game Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw, who did not play in the second half, averaged 15.6 yards per carry. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until the Hawks' fourth possession that they ran a play other than 
a McGraw run. In fact, Laguna Hills gave the ball to McGraw, the county's 
second leading rusher entering the game, on all but two plays in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy proved effective, as the Hawks scored on all but their final 
possession of the first half, all on McGraw runs. His longest was his second, 
covering 90 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point McGraw, who now has 1,947 yards and a county-high 33 touchdowns, 
scored on three consecutive carries as the Hawks sprinted to a 41-0 halftime 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach was not able to gain any momentum until the game was out of hand. 
Quarterback Nate Pivaroff, constantly pressured, was intercepted three times, 
including one that was returned by Adam Heller for a 16-yard touchdown on his 
first attempt of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Pivaroff did rush for a one-yard score in the third quarter, but by then the 
Artists trailed, 48-0. AHMED ORTIZ

 The Matadors left campus by bus Friday morning, traveling to Cedar City for 
today's game against Southern Utah after stopping in Barstow for a team workout 
in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll meet them at the (Nevada) state line," Beauregard, 22, said. "I'm 
driving there." 
</P>
<P>
 True to his word, Beauregard met the bus in Nevada and arrived in Cedar City 
on Friday night with the rest of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing jeans and a striped shirt, Beauregard arrived in San Bernardino 
Municipal Court about five minutes before his 10:30 a.m. hearing. He sat at the 
back of the courtroom and waited almost an hour before his case was heard by 
Judge Donald E. Van Luven. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard is charged with two counts of attempted murder and is out of jail 
on $100,000 bail. The purpose of Friday's hearing was to set dates for a 
pre-preliminary hearing and a preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The pre-preliminary hearing is scheduled for Dec. 14. If the case is not 
settled at that time, a preliminary hearing has been scheduled for Dec. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard, a senior and two-year starter at offensive guard, was not 
suspended from the team but missed three weeks of practice and two games after 
breaking a finger in practice on Oct. 4. He spent six days in jail before 
making bail on Oct. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to playing," he said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard is accused of shooting a former girlfriend and her male 
acquaintance outside a San Bernardino bar on Aug. 29.

ROOKIE RECEIVER BRUCE IS MAKING A GOOD FIRST IMPRESSION; RAMS: WITH THREE OF 
HIS 12 RECEPTIONS GOING FOR TOUCHDOWNS, OPPONENTS ARE BEGINNING TO PAY MORE 
ATTENTION TO HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just an impressionable rookie, Ram receiver Isaac Bruce watched, listened and 
learned as San Francisco cornerback Deion Sanders critiqued his pass routes. 
</P>
<P>
 During a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait a minute, a cornerback giving a receiver a hand with pass routes? What 
are you trying to pull on us, Isaac? 
</P>
<P>
 "He's kind of a cool guy on the field," Bruce said. "He knew I was a rookie 
and he was telling me the way to run my routes, to stay low, keep working at 
it, keep working him. He told me I would get better at it." 
</P>
<P>
 A week earlier, Bruce, in his second NFL game, had made his first pro catch 
count -- grabbing a 34-yard touchdown pass from Chris Miller against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 After seeing that game film, Sanders, one of the best cover men and trash 
talkers in the league, could have just been ragging on the rookie in an attempt 
to lull him into his coverages. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Honestly, he was trying to help," he said. "From the time I ran out of the 
huddle, he was smiling at me. I thought he was going to start ragging, but he 
was basically a good guy to me. He let me know what was wrong and what was 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Bruce, the fifth receiver taken in April's draft, is catching on and 
beginning to get a little more attention from opposing defenses around the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
 A second-stringer behind Flipper Anderson and Jessie Hester, Bruce has caught 
12 passes for 173 yards. He's second among rookie wide receivers in touchdown 
catches with three, trailing only Cincinnati's Darnay Scott (four). 
</P>
<P>
 So the Rams have a young wide receiver who has scored a touchdown one out of 
every four times he has touched the ball. Then why is he only splitting time 
with Hester? 
</P>
<P>
 "Could Isaac start? Absolutely," said Steve Moore, Ram receivers coach. "Are 
we satisfied and happy with our current starters? The answer is yes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isaac doesn't just come in on passing downs. He mixes in about 50-50 with 
Hester right now. Jessie is clearly our starter, and he's playing very, very 
well. He and Flipper have both done a very good job coaching our younger 
receivers, including Isaac." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he should be starting, Bruce just shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not up to me," he said. "That's up to the coaches. If I was put in 
that position, I know I could get the job done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the coaches) are gaining confidence in me and I'm gaining confidence 
in myself in practice. They're starting to look for me more in games now." 
</P>
<P>
 So are his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Chris Chandler, a seven-year NFL veteran, ranks Bruce among the 
best rookie receivers he has played with. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played with Andre Rison (in Indianapolis)," Chandler said, "but he and 
Isaac are different kinds of receivers so you can't really compare them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isaac is playing real well, and I haven't been around too many rookie 
receivers who have been better than him. He's right up there with Flipper right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler said Bruce reminds him of Buffalo wide receiver Billy Brooks, who 
played with Chandler in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the kind of guy who can jump out of the gym and make all the great 
catches," Chandler said. "He just runs great routes and he has one of those 
attitudes where he will run all day for you and never complain. He just doesn't 
quit." 
</P>
<P>
 No, Bruce doesn't quit. Maybe growing up 13th of 15 children in Ft. 
Lauderdale, Fla., makes you a little tougher in that respect. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Bruce didn't quit when his SAT scores were too low to let him accept a 
football scholarship to Purdue. He enrolled for two years at Santa Monica 
College, improved his grades and played well enough to land a scholarship to 
Memphis State after his sophomore year. 
</P>
<P>
 As a junior, he was the Tigers' second-leading receiver (39 catches for 532 
yards and five touchdowns) and led the team as a senior with 74 catches for 
1,054 yards and 10 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be back out here," Bruce said 
of returning to Los Angeles. "Two years ago, I was out watching the Rams 
scrimmage the Chargers in San Diego, and I never figured then that I would get 
out this way again." 
</P>
<P>
 But he did, mainly because the Rams were struggling to sign a top wide 
receiver in the off-season. They failed to trade for Dallas' Alvin Harper on 
draft day and free-agent Haywood Jeffires turned them down twice to re-signed 
with Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days before the draft, John Becker, the Rams' director of player 
personnel, reviewed some of the wide receivers Rams had looked at -- USC's 
Johnnie Morton, Colorado's Charles Johnson, Michigan's Derrick Alexander and 
Alabama's David Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker had one more name on the list -- Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore had worked out Bruce, 6-feet and 178 pounds, at Memphis State and liked 
his athletic ability. Bruce ran a 4.48-second 40-yard dash and ran smooth 
routes during the scouting combines. It was enough to convince Becker and Moore 
that Bruce was their man. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just silky smooth," Moore said. "He's as quick as a cat, has a nice run 
after the catch and gets in and out of cuts." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams could have taken Johnson or Alexander with the 16th pick, but 
bypassed him for Auburn offensive tackle Wayne Gandy. So when Bruce slipped to 
the second round, the Rams grabbed him with their pick, the 33rd overall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was overlooked a little bit (in the draft)," Bruce said, "but it doesn't 
hurt me because I'm in a great situation out here in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was just an exposure problem (at Memphis State). I was only on one 
nationally televised game in my college career, and some of those other guys 
were on every week." 
</P>
<P>
 The playing field is even now -- Bruce is sharing the spotlight with Johnson, 
Alexander, Morton and Scott on Sunday afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander has 28 catches for 481 yards and a touchdown, and Scott is having a 
fine season with 24 catches for 525 yards. Morton has struggled at Detroit and 
hasn't played as a receiver. Johnson got off to a great start in Pittsburgh -- 
catching 18 passes for 243 yards -- but hasn't contributed much in the past few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting a lot more play than some of the other rookie receivers around 
the league," Bruce said. "A lot more than a lot of the first-rounders, and 
that's surprising to me." 
</P>
<P>
 How does he think he stacks up against them? 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty well," he said. "I see Darnay having a pretty good season. It's all 
just opportunity as a rookie." 
</P>
<P>
 So the education of Isaac Bruce continues every Sunday afternoon. Moore 
proudly quotes a statistic you won't find in the box scores -- Bruce hasn't 
made an assignment error in a game yet this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a strong statement for a rookie," he said. "He's a good student, and 
he gives football the time he needs to give it off the field so he's 
mistake-free." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce eagerly awaits the Rams' Nov. 20 rematch with San Francisco -- and 
Sanders. But what if Bruce beats Deion deep a couple times, will he be quite so 
helpful as he was last time? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," Bruce said, smiling. "It'll probably change then." Measuring Up 
</P>
<P>

PREP CROSS-COUNTRY; IRVINE GIRLS SUPPORT HIGH RANKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Irvine girls' cross-country team reinforced its top ranking in the county, 
and the Corona del Mar boys got the last word in at the Sea View League finals 
Friday at Irvine Regional Park in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros edged rival El Toro, 44-46, to win the title.The Sea King boys 
avenged a dual-meet loss to Woodbridge this season and beat runner-up Newport 
Harbor, 54-65. Woodbridge finished fourth (73), behind Santa Margarita (66). 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros were fueled by the fastest time of the season on the three-mile 
course from junior Jessica Corbin, who won in 16 minutes 58 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 A new strategy was Corbin's key to her second consecutive individual title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just go out hard and stay tough," Corbin said. "It's simple, but it works." 
</P>
<P>
 Corbin built a 10-second lead on Orange County champion Tracy Clark of Corona 
del Mar, but the Sea King senior quickly cut the margin in half with a mile to 
go. Clark faded in the final third of the race, eventually finishing second in 
17:16. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Katie Nuanes of Santa Margarita (17:33), El Toro's Stacey Roberson 
(18:09) and Woodbridge freshman Mary Moore (18:22) finished third, fourth and 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys' race was won by Sea King senior Brian Slingsby, who pulled away from 
the pack late in the race en route to his fastest time of the year (14:49). 
</P>
<P>
 Slingsby held off El Toro's Martin Pennell (15:07), Newport Harbor senior 
Shahram DeZahd (15:11), Woodbridge junior Ross Venook (15:14) and Santa 
Margarita sophomore Mike Murray (15:21). MATT FARMER

LOCAL NOTES: WHITACRE TO COACH AT COSTA MESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Len Whitacre, who had a successful two-year run at Villa Park High, accepted 
the girls' basketball coaching position at Costa Mesa, the school announced 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitacre compiled a 35-11 record with the Spartans after the program had gone 
19-61 the previous four seasons.He takes over a program that played for the 
1993 State championship and has gone 47-12 the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitacre said one reason he took the job was its proximity to his home in San 
Juan Capistrano and his business in Laguna Hills. Had he been able to sell his 
home -- it was on the market for 18 months -- he would have moved closer to 
Villa Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been so difficult to coach, be a father of six children, run a 
business and drive 1 1/2 hours a day," Whitacre said. "This cuts my drive in 
half. That was a major issue." MARTIN HENDERSON

BARNES READY FOR ANOTHER CHANCE TO START; FOOTBALL: FORMER TRABUCO HILLS 
QUARTERBACK WILL DIRECT THE CAL OFFENSE AGAINST ARIZONA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pat Barnes took a snap early in the first quarter last season against Arizona 
State and sensed something was wrong. Give the kid credit for good instincts, 
because before the California freshman quarterback could complete his thought, 
several large Sun Devil defensive linemen separated Barnes' feet from the 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 That encounter smacked the giddiness of collegiate start No. 1 clear out of 
Barnes, former Trabuco Hills High quarterback. Things held to form thereafter 
as Barnes spent the afternoon simply trying to remain upright. 
</P>
<P>
 One day shy of a year later, Barnes, major Division I football's busiest 
redshirt quarterback, will start for the second time when Cal plays Arizona at 
3:30 p.m. today in a Pacific 10 game at Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited," Barnes said. "This is an opportunity for me to get back on the 
field, and I want to take the reins and run with it, but I'll be happy as long 
as we get a 'W' . . . and I don't go 11 for 33 again." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it was 10 for 33. Hey, but who's counting? 
</P>
<P>
 True, Barnes' performance against Arizona State was not one for the scrapbook. 
He misfired on 23 attempts -- but managed three completions to Sun Devil 
defenders -- and finished with only 125 yards. Cal wound up on the wrong end of 
a 41-0 score. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough, but I can't look at it as a regret," said Barnes, a 19-year-old 
who was one of the nation's most coveted high school quarterbacks in 1992. "It 
was a learning experience. I'll look back to try to take something positive 
from what happened, but I really have to look ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 The guy wasn't exactly working under optimum conditions, to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes' closest association with live action was supposed to be congratulating 
starter Dave Barr after touchdowns. However, Barr suffered a shoulder injury 
and Kerry McGonigal, Barr's backup, couldn't play against Arizona State because 
of a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Barnes. The 6-foot-4, 200-pound quarterback of the Bears' future became 
their emergency starter of the present. In the process, Cal's plan to redshirt 
Barnes ended as quickly as his hopes for a Hollywood-type debut. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, with the talented Barr back for his senior season and McGonigal, a 
junior, ready in relief, Cal put the redshirt plan back in action. 
</P>
<P>
 But something happened in what was billed as "Year of the Quarterback II" in 
the Pac-10. Several of last season's record-setting trigger men have been 
sidelined, making it "Year of the Backup Quarterback I." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is the problem more evident than at Cal, which lost Barr to a 
season-ending injury Oct. 8 when he suffered a broken collarbone in a 26-7 
victory over UCLA. McGonigal then suffered a shoulder injury in last week's 
26-23 loss to Washington State. Cal's coaches had decided to start Barnes 
against the Cougars but couldn't because he had a bruised nerve in his 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 How difficult have these injuries made things in Berkeley? Consider: The 
Bears' coaches were forced to use wide receiver Ziv Gottlieb at quarterback for 
most of the second half against Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of makes you think, 'Is there a jinx on us or what?' " Barnes said. 
"We've had two unfortunate things happen to our quarterbacks this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's loss dropped Cal to 3-5, 2-3 in conference play. It is tied for 
sixth place with Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily for Cal, its medical staff said Barnes is OK to play. Finally, 
offensive coordinator Denny Schuler can feel optimistic -- about anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd rather have Dave Barr out there finishing his career, but that's not how 
things have worked out," said Schuler, also Cal's quarterback coach. "Having 
Pat out there is our next best shot to win games." 
</P>
<P>
 Schuler said Cal's coaches regret again burning a chance to redshirt Barnes. 
But they feel they have no choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was willing to do it last year when we had a situation and he was willing 
again this year," Schuler said. "As much as we wanted to save his year, we 
couldn't look the players in the face and tell them we're just going to write 
off the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got all the tools to be an excellent quarterback, and this will help him 
next year when he's the guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing, if asked, was never in question for Barnes. After the injury to Barr, 
Cal's coaches decided to ask. Barnes first played two weeks ago in USC's 61-0 
victory over Cal. He completed three of five passes for 25 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to say no if your coach asked you if you're ready," the sophomore 
said. "I don't think any guy would turn down a chance to get out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes older brother, John, knows about seizing opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 As a walk-on quarterback at UCLA, Barnes rallied the Bruins to a 38-37 victory 
over USC in 1992. In one of the most emotional games in the series, the 
unheralded Barnes passed for 385 yards -- 204 in the fourth quarter -- and 
three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you play a team sport and the team needs you, you play," John said. "But 
they really are throwing him into the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't San Jose State or Pacific -- this is Arizona. Heck, I'd be nervous 
against those guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Pat's a bright guy, so he's not oblivious about his task. Arizona's defense, 
owner of the popular marketing moniker, Desert Swarm, hasn't been nearly as 
fierce as it was a year ago. Still, though, it's one of the nation's best. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats (6-2, 4-1) lost to Oregon, 10-9, last week, and should be in a 
foul mood. Playing against a neophyte quarterback might be the thing to bring 
back some chest thumping in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Barnes realizes he's a target, he said he won't wilt. 
</P>
<P>
 "All week, I've been visualizing being successful," Barnes said. "So much of 
this game is mental. I know that mentally, at least, I'll be ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I wouldn't mind having some eyes in the back of my head, too."

PREP ROUNDUP; NEWPORT HARBOR LOSES VOLLEYBALL MATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Newport Harbor, the No. 1 ranked girls' volleyball team in the State, lost its 
first match of the season, falling to San Jose Archbishop Mitty, 15-4, 16-14, 
11-15, 15-6, in the quarterfinals of the Santa Barbara tournament Friday at 
Santa Barbara High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors (19-1), played the quarterfinal match without setter Jenny Hecker, 
who played in the first-round victory over San Jose Leland Friday morning, but 
returned to Newport Harbor because she was a member of the homecoming court. 
</P>
<P>
 Misty May, who normally plays outside hitter, filled in at setter, but the 
Sailors were out of sync.

PACIFIC CHORALE RENEWS ITS PROMISE; MUSIC: THE SEASON OPENER REFLECTS A MESSAGE 
OF HOPE AND THE DIRECTOR'S COMMITMENT TO PRESENT NEW COMPOSERS AND MASTERWORKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Death, winter and drought -- is that any way to start a season? 
</P>
<P>
 Yet that's what's on the agenda Sunday when the Pacific Chorale opens its 
1994-95 season in Costa Mesa. Howard Hanson's "Streams in the Desert" (1969) 
was commissioned for the Texas-based International Center for Arid and 
Semi-Arid Lands Studies. Morten Lauridsen's "Mid-Winter Songs" (1980) is based 
on poems by Robert Graves; the first words are Dying sun. And Johannes Brahms 
hoped his German Requiem would reconcile the living with death and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a refreshing concert," said conductor John Alexander. "The unifying 
element of these pieces is that they move from darkness to light; they say you 
can come out of death, winter and drought. This program promotes the concept 
that whatever the difficulties, the outcome can be positive." 
</P>
<P>
 The concert is dubbed "Songs of Heaven and Earth." The group's 27th season 
continues with a Christmas concert with handbells and children's chorus Dec. 18 
and "Dances of Love and Life" with Ballet Pacifica on Feb. 26. It concludes May 
13 with "Earthly Voices," featuring Carl Orff's "Carmina Burana" with the 
Oakland Ballet and Stephen Paulus' "Voices." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander said that it's no coincidence that all the major Southland chorales 
have begun their seasons with Requiems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all so affected by all the deaths around (from AIDS)," he said. "But 
the Brahms is so different from the Mozart or Faure (Requiems). Those are 
liturgical works based on dogma. The Brahms work is based on text handpicked by 
the composer to deal with comfort, acceptance and joy. Every movement ends in a 
positive statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Brahms is my favorite piece" in all of choral music, he said. "It affects 
your spirituality; it affects your soul. Once you get into it, you cannot be 
not moved by it. Anyone who says the Requiem is a boring piece -- and I 
actually read that this week -- has not experienced it. I think it's a misnomer 
to call it a Requiem. It's not about death, it's about life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Chorale began life as the Irvine Master Chorale, a community group 
"with serious but not realistic ambitions," Alexander said. Life has changed: 
In addition to the 160-voice ensemble's local four-concert season, it will make 
appearances with the Pasadena, Long Beach and Pacific symphonies and has slated 
recording sessions for two CDs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone does all of our (rehearsals, performances and recording sessions), 
they'll be out 92 evenings in a year," Alexander said.  
</P>
<P>
 In May, Alexander was named chairman of choral activities at Cal State 
Fullerton, ending 22 years in a similar capacity at Cal State Northridge.  
</P>
<P>
 Morten (Skip) Lauridsen, meanwhile, is chairman of USC's composition 
department; his "Mid-Winter Songs" has become one of the most widely performed 
American cycles since its premiere in 1981, commissioned as a chamber work for 
USC's centennial. Robert Duerr introduced the orchestral version two years 
later in Pasadena. Last year it was heard at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center in a benefit performance by the USC Symphony, Chamber Singers and 
Concert Choir. Indeed, the work has been getting more exposure than many 
staples of the repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 "What struck me was that it would fit so unbelievably well with the Brahms 
Requiem," Alexander said. In "Mid-Winter Songs," the poet "begs that the sun 
not set, that the light be extended as long as possible. This is what happens 
to us. We want to extend the light as long as possible. In the Requiem, we 
realize that our time on Earth is limited, and it shows us how to deal with 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Lauridsen is going to become a major staple of the choral repertoire." 
</P>
<P>
 Which underscores Alexander's ongoing mission for the Pacific Chorale. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the early days, our goal was to provide classical music for Orange County, 
to perform the great masterworks," he said. "That is still a goal. But there 
are masterworks that are going to live in the repertory that people in Orange 
County have never even heard of.  
</P>
<P>
 "Presenting new music, particularly by living American composers, is a major 
mission change, and sometimes a difficult position to market. It means careful 
selection of works -- that the works can be perceived as music by the audience 
is very important." 
</P>
<P>
 He laughed. "That's socially acceptable to say these days." 
</P>
<P>
 * John Alexander conducts the Pacific Chorale in works by Brahms, Howard 
Hanson and Morten Lauridsen on Sunday at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. 7:30 p.m. $15-$40. (714) 740-2000

HE'S A WALKING ENCYCLOPEDIA OF WARNERS HISTORY; MOVIES: IT'S DOUBTFUL THAT 
ANYONE KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE STUDIO THAN DICK MASON, WHO STARTED AS A MESSENGER 
37 YEARS AGO, AND IS NOW ITS TOUR GUIDE TO THE STARS. 
</P>

<P>
 Jack Warner used to call him "the kid with the glasses." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, he used to call Warner Mr. Warner. 
</P>
<P>
 And lo these many years later, Dick Mason, Warner's erstwhile office flunky, 
has evolved into Dick Mason, Warner Bros.' institutional memory and grand tour 
meister . Mason's memory is so relentless, in fact, that even hunger doesn't 
dim it as he arrives at the Warner Bros. commissary. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came here, literally it was green," he chirps on the way to the table. 
"It was lime green, and they had a green sign out front that said the Green 
Room. But later it was nicely trimmed in blue, and it was the Blue Room." 
</P>
<P>
 Today it's a demure beige, three gastronomic colors away from Mason's debut as 
a Warner Bros. messenger 37 years ago. Actually, the 54-year-old Mason is being 
modest when he says he's been at Warners for only 37 years. He virtually sailed 
out of his mother's womb clutching his Screen Actors Guild card, since both 
parents were members. Twenty-six days after his birth, he made his eponymous 
debut in a Columbia picture called "Adam Had Four Sons." 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved movies. It just fit me like a glove, I guess, and I've been that way 
ever since." 
</P>
<P>
 From such precocious beginnings is a Warner Bros. VIP Tours manager made. 
Mason was born in Inglewood into the 68-member Mason family of hoofers. He 
spent his single-digit years dancing around the country's vaudeville circuit. 
His bit was to interrupt his dad's tap dance number with a hoot from the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say, 'You call that dancing?' And my dad would say, 'You think you could 
do better?' " 
</P>
<P>
 He would then leap onto the stage for a few minutes of "better" dancing and 
skip off to applause. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early '50s, Mason's family settled in the San Fernando Valley, where 
his father got a job as a district manager for Fox West Coast Theaters -- 
genealogy, please -- which later became Mann Theaters. The teen-age Mason spent 
hours at the theater ushering in his romance with movies, ultimately graduating 
to become a 75-cent-an-hour "indoor man" -- "candy, aisle, that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 All along, he would cap each movie by scribbling in notebooks -- the names of 
directors and producers, the running time, the players, the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still use them," he says. "They're in kid's handwriting, and I started 
tracking every movie I'd seen. I know them all by heart, all 26,000 I've seen." 
</P>
<P>
 So when Mason bounded from Van Nuys High School graduation to an interview for 
a Warner Bros. messenger job, he wasn't your usual applicant. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "My first day of training, when they took me up the stairs to the main 
building, I already knew all the credits of the directors up there," he says. 
"Not even the guy who was training me knew as much as I did. Here this guy is 
trying to impress me. He says, 'This is Mervin LeRoy.' And I said, 'Oh, yeah. 
He just finished shooting "The FBI Story." ' " 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty soon, Warners executives were calling Mason and asking him to show 
their guests around the studio. And perhaps not coincidentally, he was 
recruited to work outside Jack Warner's office, where other top executives were 
also collected. Mason worked directly for the vice president in charge of 
worldwide production. 
</P>
<P>
 "My boss would be seeing people like John Ford and Audrey Hepburn and Richard 
Widmark in one day, and I'm sitting there and meeting these people and making 
them a drink and telling a few bad jokes." 
</P>
<P>
 He was also in prime Jack Warner-watching territory, which was not necessarily 
a pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the CEO-owner, and he was a tough cookie," Mason says. "He never could 
remember my name half the time, but that was OK. I knew a lot about Warner 
Bros. movies and he liked that, so I never had any trouble. I saw him dress 
down a few people, yell and scream and have a few fits with people, but not me. 
No fun to yell at me. I'd just pass out." 
</P>
<P>
 For all Warner's guff, Mason would watch stars cry on Warner's shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Half of them would come to Jack Warner and talk to him before they'd go to a 
doctor or psychiatrist. Bette Davis would call him -- they would have fights 
but she said he was like her dad because she hated him in one sense and loved 
him in another." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, when Mason was managing the messengers' department, he was shocked to 
hear that a fledgling messenger had rebuffed Warner's request to pick up some 
letters. The messenger, who didn't recognize the top studio dog, was in a hurry 
to deliver the call sheets that listed the next day's work assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 Mason got the call. 
</P>
<P>
 " '(The messenger) gave me a real dressing down,' " Warner told him. " 'He 
told me about the call sheets, which was damn true. These are my call sheets. 
These are my movies and we've got to get them done on time. Give him a raise.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But in another mood, it could have been, 'Give him his walking papers.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the early '70s, then-vice president Frank Wells, plucked Mason out of the 
publicity department, where he'd settled, and suggested he supplement those 
duties with official tour-mongering. And now, as head of a seven-guide tour 
department (none of them actors, natch), Mason presides over an empire that 
leads around 15,000 people a year, a dozen at a pop. Their destinations: back 
lots, sound stages, set and prop areas. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mason's tour responsibilities have transcended merely pointing out Michael 
Crichton's parking space and Walton's Pond: Over the years, he has grappled 
with such tourists' questions as, what does Elizabeth Taylor eat for breakfast 
and where's John Wayne's time card. He has even been called on to pry an 
enthusiastic fan off the Duke. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right here in the commissary, I was having lunch with a banker and his wife 
from New York. She was telling me throughout the tour that next to her husband, 
John Wayne was the man she loved the most. When John Wayne hit the door, she 
jumped up on the front of him, grabbed him around the neck and kissed him on 
the cheek. She was so short her legs were dangling off the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Mason has escorted moguls and monarchs, Barbra Streisand and 
Glenn Close. He still hops to when the execs call, and he's about to give a 
tour to a guest of Warner Bros. Chairman Bob Daly. 
</P>
<P>
 But before he goes, he pilots a tour cart past the site of Frank Sinatra's 
helipad, past Richard Donner's production office, among the back lots and sound 
stages where he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Mason: "I probably spent more time on this lot than any place I've lived 
since starting to work here."

POP BEAT: MINING VERUCA SALT; SINCE INDIE HIT 'SEETHER,' THE CHICAGO BAND HAS 
BECOME AN INDUSTRY DARLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I think people just expect us to be larger than life and as good as Led 
Zeppelin," says Louise Post, co-leader of the Chicago rock group Veruca Salt. 
Her comment is a sarcastic reaction to all the hype that her band has generated 
since its indie-label single, "Seether," hit college radio last March. 
</P>
<P>
 "Led Zeppelin?" says the 27-year-old singer-guitarist. "No problem!" 
</P>
<P>
 Though hardly world-famous yet, Veruca Salt is the latest name to be dropped 
in nauseatingly hip clubs and at catered industry functions.  
</P>
<P>
 The prefab buzz came from early chatter in the underground rock world, which 
in turn caught the ear of college radio deejays, who began playing the 
quartet's single. It also helped that the band had the proper indie credentials 
to woo image-conscious fans. It has independent label du jour Minty Fresh 
behind it, and has worked with producer Brad Wood of Liz Phair fame. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, major labels took the bait and a heavy-duty bidding war ensued, 
resulting in Veruca Salt signing on at Geffen Records less than two months 
after its debut album, "American Thighs," was released by Minty Fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 But how substantial is the group with the scratchy-sweet pop hit and the 
bandwagon praise?  
</P>
<P>
 On "Seether," with its pure, high vocals and catchy rhythm, the group 
straddles the line between one-hit-wonderdom and deeper, edgy artistry. But 
listeners who check out the album will find some real substance. The songs, 
which pit the crystalline vocals of Post and second guitarist Nina Gordon 
against churning, fuzzy guitar are angry, passive, intense and perfectly 
bittersweet. 
</P>
<P>
 So despite being the latest novelty to be pulled from the indie-rock hat, 
Veruca Salt actually deserves some respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attention's overwhelming and flattering," says Post, whose band also 
includes drummer Jim Shapiro (Gordon's brother) and bassist Steve Lack. "But 
someone once said, 'You may have the red carpet going in, but don't think you 
have it going out.' I think that depends on how people respond to our music, 
not the industry." 
</P>
<P>
 The band started in 1992 in Chicago's Wicker Park area when Gordon and Post 
were introduced by a mutual friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We considered our sound dreamy and ethereal until Jim started playing drums," 
says Post. "He took it to a new level. He's very hard-hitting." 
</P>
<P>
 Post has pulled some of the sonic inspiration that drives Veruca Salt from 
bands such as Irish "dream-pop" band My Bloody Valentine.  
</P>
<P>
 "They made a big impact on me because they played the voice over a big heavy 
wall of guitar," she says. "It was intriguing and liberating because I wasn't 
aware I could actually be heard over guitars, being that I have a soft voice. 
They made me realize it was possible." At the moment, music has become 
secondary to the band, which for the past few months has been tied up dealing 
with the landslide of attention. "Our lives have been turned upside-down 
dealing with the business end of things," Post says. "Now we're just trying to 
get back to basics and work on becoming a better band. I'm glad all that 
industry stuff is over." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Veruca Salt (named after a character in the children's book "Charlie 
and the Chocolate Factory") can slip back into a more low-profile role as it 
opens for the highly touted Hole in San Diego on Tuesday and in L.A. on 
Wednesday. But Post knows that there's still plenty of career tension to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pressure is not scary to me," she says. "I can't wait till the next 
record. I just want to make it! I want to have a serious career beyond all 
this. I want this band to be doing this in 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 * Veruca Salt opens for Hole on Tuesday at SOMA, 5305 Metro St., San Diego, 8 
p.m. $10. (619) 239-7662. Also Wednesday at the Hollywood Palladium, 6250 
Sunset Blvd., 7:30 p.m. Sold out. (213) 962-7600.

'THE TRICK IS NOT TO BORE PEOPLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1967, Bob Navarro, a young high school dropout who grew up near USC, landed 
one of the most sought-after jobs around: a news writer at then-KNXT-TV Channel 
2 on "The Big News," considered by many to be the premier local TV newscast in 
the country. A few years later, he pestered his way onto the air as a reporter, 
and he has been working in the trenches of local news ever since.  
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in 1978, he served a 10-year stint reporting in Sacramento and 
Orange County for KNBC-TV Channel 4. He has also produced documentaries at 
KCET-TV Channel 28, served as news director at Spanish-language KVEA-TV Channel 
52 and worked as a reporter at KTLA-TV Channel 5 and KCAL-TV Channel 9.  
</P>
<P>
 Last April, he returned to Channel 2 as KCBS' director of editorials, 
researching, writing and reading the station's on-air position statements on 
local affairs. No longer a reporter, he satisfies his inquisitive instincts by 
hosting and producing "Bob Navarro's Journal," a discussion program -- "don't 
call it a public-affairs show" -- that examines one news issue each Sunday at 
9:30 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: You've been around from the good old days of serious and thoughtful 
TV news to what your former colleague Jess Marlow once called "the dark days." 
What changes have struck you most in that time? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: There are now so many more outlets in media across the board, and that 
has forced everyone, including newspapers, I wouldn't say to dumb down the 
product, but to go for a mass audience. Also, increasingly, newsrooms are a 
little more representative of the community at large. When I first came to "The 
Big News," there was a woman reporter, a woman writer, no woman on the desk, no 
woman producer. That was it. There was an African American, but no Chicanos. I 
was the first one. And today, newsrooms are supposed to be profit centers. 
Although I'm sure "The Big News" was a profit center, that wasn't its cachet. 
What the general manager showed off was, "Look at this jewel that I operate." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How has all that affected what the viewer sees? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, you can still find the information, but you have to hunt a little 
more. In trying to reach the mass audience, the emphasis is still on 
information, but it's in tandem with trying to make it compelling, so the 
viewer will hang around. When I first started, the deal was: This is what they 
need to know. That's it. Not what they want to see, but what they need to know. 
That has blurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is the news we get diluted or sensationalized? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Definitely there's some of that. For a long time now we've seen just a 
shameful display of body-bag journalism. It's such a cheap way to do things, 
and this station just put an end to it. And what has bothered me a lot is that 
there seems to be a lack of respect (among many TV journalists) for what 
they're doing. The willingness to trivialize, the willingness to be flip with 
facts. To sort of put yourself above or on the same level as those you are 
reporting on. You hear it when they call the President "Bill." It's all part of 
the vulgarization of discourse across our country. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there any hope?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Since every crazy thing has been tried, I think you're starting to see 
stations sneaking back to the basics, without preaching to you that you're 
seeing a basic newscast in fear that people will run off. The trick is not to 
bore people to death, if that's the way you pitch it -- which may be more 
difficult than we'd like to think, because if you look at the ratings, the more 
crap you throw out there, apparently, the better it's accepted. But maybe now 
we're starting to reach the level where we're crap-proof. I tell you one thing, 
if it's junk, and you people out there refuse to watch it, it will change. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Still, take the O.J. Simpson case. Isn't it overkill, pandering to the 
tastes of that mass audience to the neglect of significant events such as the 
governor's race? 
</P>
<P>
 A: What are you going to do? If I'm running a newspaper, I'll put the 
President and the governor's race on the front page and find my select audience 
and try to sell it. But if you're in a mass media? The one station that cut out 
of the preliminary hearing went down the toilet. 
</P>
<P>
 It's shameful that we might have a 20% voter turnout in this election. But you 
can't just blame TV news. I think it's just an overall cynicism among people 
out there. There really isn't an institution in this country -- Congress, the 
presidency, the media and all other businesses -- that hasn't been sullied by 
its own members. That needs to be addressed, but everyone in all those 
institutions has to want to address it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Has the position of minorities in TV news improved? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Obviously there are far more minorities and women working in the newsroom. 
But if we're still operating under the same system, it doesn't matter much. The 
product stays the same, the management stays the same, the promotion stays the 
same. The trick is to adjust the system a little more, and you do it by having 
people work their way to the very top level, above news director, into the 
boardrooms where they allocate the resources. It's a very difficult process. 
It's better than it was, but it does have a ways to go. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's more than just numbers. We're so fragmented in this society, in this 
city, and somehow we have to become inclusive again. It's good for us to hang 
onto our individuality and our culture, but we're a total community and that 
includes everyone. It's not necessarily to our benefit to keep pushing what 
separates us. We should be looking for things we have in common, or else we're 
going to enter the 21st Century in a really dangerous position. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you miss reporting? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Not yet, I've been so busy. I've never been a commentator or editorial 
writer, and it's a lot of responsibility. We sat down and came down against 
Prop. 186 because I don't think it's good for the state, even though I'm in 
favor of universal health coverage, and I went on the air and said it 13 times. 
That's heady stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the value of editorials? No one else in town does them. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, that's about money. They'd rather show commercials and, in all 
fairness, the viewer doesn't exactly hold anyone's feet to the fire (demanding 
editorials). We're the only station in town doing them now, and I've been told 
there's only about 15 broadcasters across the country still in that business. 
It's a way to really serve the community, to be responsible. It makes you a 
part of the area where you live, asks people what they think and provokes them 
to get involved if they want. That's what a TV station should do.

YEARS LATER, STILL UP FOR THE COUNT; JAZZ: BASIE'S INFLUENCE BEST LIVES ON IN 
MUSICIANS, SUCH AS THOSE IN THE FRANK CAPP JUGGERNAUT ENSEMBLE, WHO WORKED WITH 
HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the world of jazz royalty, Count Basie is king. From his Kansas City days 
in the '30s until his death in 1984, Basie's trademark rhythm section pulse, 
contrasting brass soloists and his own spare, well-placed piano style were, for 
many, the very definition of the word "jazz." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years after his death, William (Count) Basie's influence is still strongly 
felt. Indeed, a reawakening of interest in the Basie sound is in full swing, 
and scores of Basie's recordings from all periods are being reissued as young 
musicians look to copy his trademark sounds, both in small groups and in 
orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Basie influence best lives on with the musicians who worked with him. 
"Anybody who played with Mr. Basie when he was alive feels the results of their 
time with him," said vocalist Dennis Rowland, who spent seven years with the 
Count's last band. "His impact on all musicians is tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
 Rowland will be among those paying tribute to Basie on Sunday at the Irvine 
Marriott when the Frank Capp Juggernaut, an ensemble with numerous ties to the 
Basie legend, strikes up in a program of music made famous by the Count. (The 
Four Freshmen also will appear to pay tribute to one of its founding members, 
Ross Barbour.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm often asked why we're still playing the same arrangements that the Basie 
band played," said drummer Capp, who formed the Capp-Pierce Juggernaut in 1975 
with his late friend, pianist Nat Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the classics: Every orchestra in the world still plays Beethoven's 
Fifth. The conductor is different; the players are different, it's a different 
interpretation. But it's the same notes. I like to refer to the (jazz) greats 
like the classical composers. And Basie is the Beethoven of jazz." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alto saxophonist Marshall Royal, a regular member of the Juggernaut, knew 
Basie better than most. (Because of a prior engagement, Royal will not appear 
with the Juggernaut on Sunday.) Royal replaced Buddy DeFranco in Basie's 
seven-piece ensemble in 1951, joining saxophonist Wardell Gray and trumpeter 
Clark Terry in the front line, then helped Basie re-form his big band that same 
year. He served as Basie's musical director for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took the arrangements he used in the early days, which were mostly flag 
raisers, and changed the tempos to a lot of the tunes, made them more danceable 
and listenable," Royal said by phone recently from his Los Angeles home. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, Basie, who was then in his 50s, was delegating most of the 
musical work to his band members, according to Royal:  
</P>
<P>
 "He liked to take things easy and just play the piano, so he just sort of 
turned the musical thing over to me. He was very easy to work with." 
</P>
<P>
 Basie's genius, Royal said, was his feel for his audience. "He knew how to get 
to people and was very likable and well-respected. He had a knack for pulling 
out music -- knew what to choose for his dance set, knew what to choose for his 
listening set. He knew the business and got along well with his band." 
</P>
<P>
 Recalled Rowland: "He was like one of the guys. Everybody had respect for him, 
and he had respect for all of the guys. That's why people played with him so 
long. He was very sensitive, very warm and very aware of musical trends. I 
loved every minute I had with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Capp never worked in the Basie orchestra -- though he did appear with the 
pianist as a member of both the old Steve Allen and Joey Bishop show bands -- 
but Basie's influence on the Juggernaut is undeniable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had much personal contact with him. But Nat was very close to him. 
When we recorded our first album, we took it for the Count to hear. He just sat 
there with a grin on his face from ear to ear. That was our stamp of approval." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the Juggernaut's music comes from the Basie book, with many of the 
tunes written for the Count by composer-trumpeter Neal Hefti, for whom Capp 
played in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Hefti who wrote many of the arrangements for the Basie band in the late 
'50s, most notably for the 1958 Roulette recording "Basie Plays Hefti."  
</P>
<P>
 "That album with Neal's tunes brought the Basie band back onto the scene, 
after a period when he wasn't quite as visible," Capp said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Pierce and Capp formed their Juggernaut, Hefti gave them many of the 
charts he wrote for the Count, and they've become staples with the band. Capp 
and the Juggernaut just finished recording a new album of Hefti's music, titled 
"The Juggernaut in a Hefti Bag." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, who sat in for an ailing Basie during the Count's 1976 tour, also 
contributed to the Basie library, notably "Mr. Softey," a tune that Capp said 
the band will play Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll also play 'Moten Swing,' which is our theme song, 'Shiney Stockings,' 
'Whirley-bird' -- all those Basie tunes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt, with the Count's music in the air and some of his associates, 
including Rowland and trumpeter Snooky Young, on the bandstand, Basie's spirit 
will be present as well. Rowland said that spirit permeates his every 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I reflect back, every time I tell someone who I am, I get a 
flashback of those days," Rowland said. "That experience makes a difference in 
my career; it will always give me respect with the music community. And it's 
all because I sang with Count Basie." 
</P>
<P>
 * "A Tribute to Count Basie" featuring the Frank Capp Juggernaut with 
vocalists Dennis Rowland and Barbara Morrison, and the Four Freshmen "Salute to 
Ross Barbour" with Bobby Troup, will be Sunday at the Irvine Marriott, 18000 
Von Karman Ave., Irvine. 6 p.m. $25. (714) 553-9449.

WHAT'S HIS PLEASURE?; CROWD FAVORITE GENE HARRIS SAYS THE ONLY AUDIENCE HE AIMS 
TO SATISFY IS HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pianist Gene Harris is an expert at crowd control. Known for a rich, jubilant 
style, Harris is the kind of piano player who involves his listeners, eliciting 
shouts and cries from them as he works, giving his live performances the feel 
of a revival meeting held under a tent on a hot summer night. 
</P>
<P>
 During a February performance at Catalina Bar & Grill in Hollywood, Harris, 
though he denies it's his style, performed a calculated reworking of blues, 
ballads and pop tunes to stir up the assembled. His solos built from cool, 
sophisticated phrases played at reserved tempos to roaring, dynamic statements 
that recalled the strength Joe Williams used to call up when singing in front 
the Basie band. In short, he's the kind of musician who can drive a crowd wild. 
</P>
<P>
 His bassist, Luther Hughes, once told us that he'd never worked with another 
musician who could "reach out and get the audience in the palm of his hand and 
work them like a big piece of putty the way Gene does. He's a master at 
communicating with a crowd through the keyboard." 
</P>
<P>
 But ask Harris how calculated is his rapport with an audience -- if, indeed, 
he plays to the crowd and how its response affects his play -- and he sounds a 
bit miffed when he answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that would be the phoniest way you could ever make a living, playing 
to an audience," he said Thursday from his home in Boise, Ida. "When I work, I 
definitely play for Gene Harris. I do the things that sound right for me, that 
make me happy." 
</P>
<P>
 And, he says, that policy has always paid dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember the first time I played Birdland in New York back in '57 or '58. I 
don't remember who the other bands were that night, but the audience sat there 
very reserved and listened and applauded politely. Then I came up and played, 
and they went totally nuts for every song I did. People got up on their feet 
and danced. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always been that way. As long as I play for me, I'm in good shape. It's 
when I try to do things for people that I'm not as successful. That's why I 
never take requests, never write out a set for the band in advance; they never 
know what I'm going to play from song to song. I'm playing totally 
spontaneously, and I'm playing to make me happy. And music does make me happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Though this policy may sound selfish, it's resulted in one of the most 
successful careers in the business. Harris, who performs Sunday afternoon at 
Orange Coast College, was born in Benton Harbor, Mich., in 1931 and was largely 
self-taught as a player. He modeled his sound on recordings he heard of piano 
legends Albert Ammons and Pete Johnson. In 1956, he joined with bassist Andy 
Simpkins and drummer Bill Dowdy to form the Three Sounds, a popular trio that 
made its reputation on accessible blues and pop-generated jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris continued leading the Three Sounds after the departure of Simpkins and 
Dowdy in the late '60s, then began forming groups under his own name while 
working with the likes of Ernestine Anderson, Ray Brown and Benny Carter. 
Southern Californians got a chance to know him well in the early '80s, when he 
was a regular in bassist Brown's house trio at the now-defunct Loa club in 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today Harris, who claims he's continually trying to cut down on travel to 
spend more time in Idaho, has reassembled his 18-piece Superband, which toured 
the world (Cairo, Casablanca, Istanbul, Ankara, Seoul and New York) in 1989 and 
1990 and is readying the group for another globe-trotting jaunt. 
</P>
<P>
 He's also doing his best to resist a burgeoning career as a soloist, which was 
spurred by his 1993 solo recording "Live at Maybeck Recital Hall." His 
rendition of "My Funny Valentine" was pulled from the disc and used in the 
movie "Malice." People magazine took notice of the tune, and suddenly he was 
being called for unaccompanied performances, something he'll be doing across 
the United Kingdom later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the biggest mistake I've made was doing that solo album," he grumbled, 
teasingly. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harris' main vehicle is his quartet with bassist Hughes, guitarist Ron 
Eschete and drummer Paul Humphrey, who'll be with him in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it may seem overkill to include a guitar in the mix, especially with 
Harris' multilayered sound, the pianist finds that the formula suits his style. 
And once again, it's what pleases him that counts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Asking me why I use the guitar is like asking why I use the bass. It's a 
rhythm thing. I like getting that pulse. But it's also my love for the guitar. 
I have one here at home and will mess around with it from time to time. I 
personally just love the sound of the instrument and especially the way Ronnie 
plays it." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris chooses material the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always looking for new songs. There's no such thing as a certain kind of 
thing that attracts me. I don't care if it's country, rock or jazz. If it makes 
me feel good, I'm going to use it." 
</P>
<P>
 And sure enough, a Harris program ranges far and wide over the musical 
spectrum, even including such flag wavers as "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" 
at one time. 
</P>
<P>
 His 1992 album "Like a Lover" is typical. Harris' quartet covers "You Make Me 
Feel So Young," Thelonious Monk's "Misterioso," the Ray Charles hit "I Can't 
Stop Loving You," and a Bing Crosby tune from 1931, "Wrap Your Troubles in 
Dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 His latest CD, "Funky Gene's," though concentrated on the blues, is equally 
expansive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to learn as much music as I can and to continue growing as a musician. 
I want you to be able to pull down my recordings from the '50s, then the '60s 
and the '70s and the '80s and hear that I've progressed musically. I'm hoping 
that in the year 2010, you'll hear me and say, 'Boy, that Gene Harris just gets 
better and better.' "

 Proposition 180 -- In a comparison of the environmental records of Gov. Pete 
Wilson and Kathleen Brown, The Times reported their differing views on a ballot 
initiative, Prop. 180, in a manner that indicated the initiative is on the Nov. 
8 ballot.The proposition, which would have provided $2 billion in bond money 
for parks and the protection of natural resources, was defeated last June. As 
reported, Brown endorsed it. Wilson opposed it.

 Coto de Caza attacks -- An article Thursday about a fight in Coto de Caza 
incorrectly quoted Karen Barkovitz. She said the lingering feeling of such an 
attack was to shatter the illusion "of this beautiful, gated community being 
completely safe, as people think it is." A quote from someone else was 
inadvertently attributed to her.

chief executive, positions he has held since 1986.

PRINCE BIDS CHEERIO TO AN AWED BUT PUZZLED L.A. 
</P>

 All week long, he was a prince of contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the aides almost constantly at Prince Charles' side was a serious-minded 
woman with a sheaf of papers who runs his business and community partnership 
organization. There was also a military man in a gold-braided uniform who 
scoops up the gifts bestowed upon the prince. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Los Angeles, he was protected by the State Department and the Los 
Angeles Police Department and escorted by the California Highway Patrol, yet 
he's not a politician. He rules nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Friday, the last day of his Los Angeles tour, in the rotunda of the 
Downtown Central Library, he engaged in a round of handshaking with dark-suited 
Fortune 500 company chiefs. Then he caught sight of a local activist, Ted 
Hayes, in trademark dreadlocks and beret (how could the prince miss him?), and 
strode over to chat about Hayes' geodesic domed village for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 As the prince flew (by commercial airline) to Hong Kong on Friday, he left a 
cascade of images in his wake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Prince of Wales supped in black tie Thursday night at the estate of 
producer Aaron Spelling -- but had spent most of Tuesday talking to youngsters 
in the Crenshaw district and South-Central L.A. who will probably get no closer 
to Aaron Spelling than watching "Melrose Place." People expect that dichotomy 
in American presidential candidates. But they don't know what to make of it in 
a British prince. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as some people in celebrity-inured Los Angeles waited to see him, they 
had questions. "I appreciate he's coming to a lot of places in the African 
American community," said a puzzled Charlene Nunnery, 39, as she waited outside 
the Vons supermarket in Inglewood on Wednesday morning for the prince to 
appear. "But why didn't he take in Brentwood and Beverly Hills? Did he pick 
these places?" 
</P>
<P>
 His aides picked them -- with his blessing. Although Charles may have a 
country house and titled friends to fill it with for dinner; although he's 
married to (and separated from) one of the most photogenic women in the world; 
although he skis in Switzerland and plays the rich man's sport of polo, he 
spends a third of his time (according to aides) working to get businesses 
involved in disadvantaged communities. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 So Charles got to end his last day in Los Angeles doing one of the things he 
likes to do best: waxing philosophical about urban problems. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his first and only chance to leave some public impressions of his trip, 
and he did so in a speech he gave before a group of people gathered at the 
invitation of his own Business Leaders Forum, one of several organizations he 
runs from London that fund struggling young entrepreneurs and coax business 
leaders into community work and philanthropy. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I have seen myself this week in Los Angeles demonstrates the strength 
and vitality which can be unleased in the midst of some of the worst urban 
areas if community leaders work side by side with business and city 
authorities," Charles told the group. 
</P>
<P>
 He seemed struck by the African saying now appropriated and made popular in 
American black communities: "At Food From the 'Hood at Crenshaw High School," 
Charles said, "students pointed out that 'it takes a village to raise a child.' 
Putting the welcome mat out for parent volunteers and business mentors will 
help to raise achievement." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes, who has become something of a favorite with the British royal family 
(Prince Edward, Charles' younger brother, visited the domed village last year), 
hoped the prince's interest in his cause would bring his project some badly 
needed money.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's like you're not wanted locally until someone outside wants you," said 
Hayes, fresh from his encounter with the prince. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as the prince tried to say at least something to everyone, he ignored 
the press that trailed him like a 500-pound gorilla. Never mind that Charles 
and Diana are daily grist for the tabloid mills. He doesn't do the interview 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not a politician," one aide said simply. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, American writers strained over ropes and past burly guards to 
catch just a scintilla of Charles' conversations. The British reporters, on the 
other hand, were brilliant at picking up whole sentences 10 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, coverage is problematic: "I think you're always going to be up 
against the fact that he's a middle-aged man in a suit," said Robert Jobson, 
Daily Express royal correspondent. "I hate being called a royal observer. Makes 
me sound like a pervert." 
</P>
<P>
 If you're a prince, this royal tour moved fast. If you're the artist-on-tour, 
it moved at the speed of light. Much too fast to get anything more than a few 
quick sketches of faces and torsos. Still, Tom Hallifax, a Belfast artist with 
a bald pate and a black hat, doffed his jacket and pulled up a cinder block in 
the Crenshaw High garden Tuesday to dash off a few quick pencil renderings. 
Much of the trip he would sketch later. "I took Polaroids," he said Friday.
