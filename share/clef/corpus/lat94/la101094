 HOT DISPUTE: Ventura County's cash-strapped schools could be out nearly $30 
million collectively if Proposition 187 passes (B1) . . . Proponents of the 
measure -- which would bar illegal immigrants from public services -- argue it 
could ultimately save California close to $10 billion a year. The state's 
acting schools chief, William D. Dawson, predicts legal headaches if the 
measure passes."It's going to be a snake pit of litigation." 
</P>
<P>
 FASHION FLASH: In the movie "The Graduate," the word "plastics" was whispered 
into Dustin Hoffman's ear as the secret to success. . . . Now, officials are 
hoping T-shirts made of recycled plastic will help launch stores planned for 
state parks. There are two such stores in Sacramento -- and no plans yet to 
open one in Ventura County. But the shirt is available by mail. "It's softer 
than cotton," marveled parks spokeswoman Laura Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
 OLDER AND WISER: Break out the champagne: Several Ventura County cities 
celebrate birthdays this month, and a couple of them are big ones. . . . 
Thousand Oaks will turn 30 with a celebration (B5), and Camarillo will reach 
the big 3-0 on Oct. 22. And today, Simi Valley hits the quarter-century mark. . 
. . Moorpark, by comparison, is on the brink of adolescence: That city 
celebrated its 11th anniversary this year.

FIREFIGHTERS EXTINGUISH BLAZE THAT BLACKENED 1,000 ACRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 90 firefighters remained in Agua Dulce on Sunday to snuff out the embers 
of a brush fire that scorched more than 1,000 acres and threatened a mobile 
home park and other structures in the small community between the Antelope and 
Santa Clarita valleys, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A downed power line is suspected of sparking the blaze, which broke out about 
10 a.m. Saturday near Agua Dulce Canyon Road south of the Antelope Valley 
Freeway, authorities said.It quickly spread west toward Santa Clarita, pushed 
by 20-m.p.h. Santa Ana winds, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weather forecasters predicted more Santa Ana conditions today combined to 
near-record high temperatures, said Kris Farnsworth, a meteorologist with 
WeatherData Inc., a weather service used by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures are expected to reach the high 90s Downtown and in inland valleys 
today, with accompanying low humidity of about 13% compared with the region's 
usual 50%, Farnsworth said. But relief is expected Tuesday with temperatures 
dropping by about seven degrees and onshore winds bringing in ocean moisture, 
he said.

MCDANIEL KEEPS THE RAIDERS ON TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Raider cornerback Terry McDaniel had turned his head to shout orders at fellow 
defensive back Derrick Hoskins. 
</P>
<P>
 When he looked back, there was the football coming his way. 
</P>
<P>
 So what else is new? 
</P>
<P>
 McDaniel cradled the ball in his arms and ran 14 yards into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 So what else is new? 
</P>
<P>
 Before he was done, McDaniel had tied a club record with three interceptions 
to lead a defense that hung on to a 21-17 victory over the New England Patriots 
on Sunday before 59,889 at Foxboro Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders needed all the defensive help they could get when their offense 
was bogged down with interceptions, a fumble, penalties, failures on crucial 
third- and fourth-down situations and a somewhat inconsistent running game. 
</P>
<P>
 So what else is new? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, there were some offensive highlights for a team that improved to 2-3. 
Quarterback Jeff Hostetler completed 17 of 31 passes for 250 yards, went to 
Harvey Williams on a 27-yard touchdown pass and scored himself on a three-yard 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hostetler also threw three interceptions to keep New England in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, battling Ty Montgomery for the starting tailback job, came up with 
the best individual rushing effort of the season for the Raiders, gaining 65 
yards on 17 carries for a 3.8-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
 But the team failed to crack the 100-yard mark for the fourth time in five 
games. No other Raiders could find much daylight, with Tom Rathman, Montgomery 
and Hostetler combining for 21 yards to give the Raiders a total of 86. 
Montgomery fumbled the ball away in the fourth quarter, aborting yet another 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Raiders were penalized 11 times for 70 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 But two of those calls left them grumbling long after the final whistle had 
sounded. And they came on the same Patriot drive. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking the early lead on Matt Bahr's 24-yard field goal, the Patriots, 
coming into the game with a three-game winning streak after losing their first 
two, fell behind Sunday on McDaniel's second-quarter touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 New England regained the lead when quarterback Drew Bledsoe went to Kevin 
Turner on a seven-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots immediately got the ball back when the deep man on the ensuing 
kickoff, Rocket Ismail, said he and an up man had a "miscommunication" problem, 
leaving the ball bouncing free for New England's Steve Hawkins to gain 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, New England drove to the Raider six, where the Patriots faced a 
fourth and goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Time for a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Bahr swung his foot, defender Andrew Glover went into the air to attempt a 
block and an official's flag also sailed into the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling? Glover was guilty of unsportsmanlike conduct for leaping into the 
air without starting with at least one foot on the line of scrimmage, giving 
him a running start. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been doing that for years," Glover said, "and they've never called me on 
it. (The call) was a total shock. I'm going to look at the film and make sure 
in the future that I'm on the same page as the officials. I've got a lot of 
pride. For an official to make a call like that without knowing what's going on 
is a disgrace to our team." 
</P>
<P>
 Given a second chance, the Patriots brought their offensive unit back on the 
field and, three plays later, Bledsoe, who wound up completing 23 of 55 for 321 
yards, went to Leroy Thompson for a three-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Or did he? 
</P>
<P>
 Replays appeared to show that Thompson was not able to break the plane of the 
end zone with the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little shocked (by the call)," said Raider linebacker Rob 
Fredrickson, one of those applying the muscle to keep Thompson out. 
</P>
<P>
 The touchdown stood, but there would not be another for the home team. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler's touchdown pass to Williams with 42 seconds remaining in the half 
brought the Raiders to 17-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Their go-ahead touchdown came off another McDaniel interception. 
</P>
<P>
 This one, ending New England's opening drive of the second half, was first 
tipped by lineman Jerry Ball before it wound up in McDaniel's hands. 
</P>
<P>
 On the subsequent drive, the Raiders faced a third and three at the New 
England three-yard line. Hostetler went over to the sideline to talk matters 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 It was decided that the first option would be a quarterback sneak. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler said he had alternatives if, when he looked over the defense at the 
line of scrimmage, "I didn't like the look." 
</P>
<P>
 But, based on what he saw, the play "felt good." 
</P>
<P>
 It felt even better an instant later when Hostetler dived into the end zone 
and the Raiders took the lead, 21-17. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it was up to the defense. And, of course, McDaniel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots drove right back and had a third and goal at the Raider one-yard 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice they handed Marion Butts the ball and twice he was stopped. But twice 
the Raiders were whistled for an illegal move by their line, encroachment by 
Anthony Smith followed by a false start by Nolan Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
 On their third try, the Patriots gave the ball to Turner, who tried an air 
route, diving over the top of the line. But linebacker Greg Biekert was waiting 
for Turner, taking to the air himself to knock the New England back. 
</P>
<P>
 With the ball still in his possession, Turner, as he headed downward, tried to 
stretch the ball over the goal line. Unfortunately for him, Turner came down on 
Butts, the ball crashing into Butts' helmet and squirting loose, the Raiders' 
Patrick Bates falling on it. 
</P>
<P>
 By the width of a helmet, the Raiders had held. 
</P>
<P>
 The next New England drive was killed by McDaniel's third interception. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am blessed," he said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Like never before. 
</P>
<P>
 McDaniel already has five interceptions to equal his career single-season 
high. His three interceptions Sunday tied a team record equaled by seven 
others. His touchdown was his third of the season, the others coming on an 
interception and a fumble recovery. That ties McDaniel with Williams for the 
team lead in touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball seems to find him like a missile," Coach Art Shell said. "It's 
zeroing in on him." 
</P>
<P>
 So what else is new?

CHARGERS BULLY WAY TO 5-0 START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A very physical message was sent to the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday: There is 
a new bully in the AFC West. 
</P>
<P>
 The message came in resounding fashion from the undefeated San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the running of Natrone Means and a suffocating defensive front, the 
Chargers pounded Kansas City to remain the NFL's only undefeated team with a 
20-6 victory before 62,923 at Jack Murphy Stadium, the largest home crowd in 
Charger history. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing eight consecutive regular-season games to the Chiefs, San Diego 
made sure of its statement by dominating both sides of the ball while extending 
Kansas City's touchdown scoreless streak to eight quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego's biggest and most punishing weapon was Means, who ran for a 
career-high 125 yards in 19 carries. With his offensive line opening gaping 
holes, Means scored one touchdown and set up another as the Chargers averaged 
five yards a carry in gaining 151 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had two weeks to kind of build this game up and it definitely had a 
playoff atmosphere," San Diego linebacker Junior Seau said. "I hope we kind of 
boosted our stock in the NFL to get the respect we deserve." 
</P>
<P>
 With a 5-0 record, the Chargers are off to their best start since 1961, when 
they finished 11-0 to win the AFL Western Division Championship. San Diego, 
which has defeated all four of its AFC West rivals, also moved two games ahead 
of the second-place Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 How thoroughly did the Chargers' defense dominate the line of scrimmage? 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City quarterback Joe Montana's 55 pass attempts say it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a running game, Montana was forced to rely on short passes, completing 
37 for 310 yards, but was kept out of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "At times he did look rattled," said Seau, who had a game-high 12 tackles. "We 
won the battle up front and we knew once we could get them to pass, we had them 
where we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Of Montana's 37 completions, 19 were to backs. Marcus Allen was his favorite, 
with nine catches for 83 yards. On the ground, however, Allen rushed for only 
17 yards in 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made some good plays on runs," Montana said. "Those guys up front are 
pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers did not waste time taking control of the game by gaining good 
field position, something they have done well all season. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking the opening kickoff, San Diego drove to near midfield before 
punting, pinning the Chiefs back to their nine-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, the Charger defense took over, forcing Kansas City to punt after 
three plays. San Diego needed only 11 plays before John Carney kicked a 23-yard 
field goal for a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 After Montana led the Chiefs on a 14-play, 63-yard drive at the start of the 
second quarter that tied the game on a 25-yard field goal by Lin Elliott, San 
Diego responded with scores on its next two possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Carney kicked a 32-yarder to make it 6-3 after a 64-yard drive highlighted by 
a 48-yard pass play from Stan Humphries to Tony Martin. Following a Kansas City 
punt, the Chargers came right back behind Means, who carried five consecutive 
times before finishing the 43-yard drive with a nine-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third quarter, both teams struggled to move the ball as they combined 
to punt five times. The Chiefs managed only a 25-yard field goal by Elliott to 
begin the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 With a 13-6 lead and 13:02 remaining in the game, San Diego turned to Means 
again. The Chargers drove 77 yards in nine plays, with Means accounting for 57 
in four carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries finished off the drive with a five-yard touchdown pass to wide 
receiver Mark Seay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Natrone had a great ball game," San Diego Coach Bobby Ross said. "He ran the 
ball extremely well. When we had to get it done in the fourth quarter, we had a 
good patented drive and most of it was on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Forced to play catch-up, Montana twice drove the Chiefs deep into San Diego 
territory in the final four minutes. Not only was he hurried on many of his 
throws but he also had several passes dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind, the best team won," Kansas City Coach Marty Schottenheimer said.

RAIDER ERRORS LESS COSTLY IN 21-17 VICTORY; PRO FOOTBALL: BOTH TEAMS COMMIT 
FOUR TURNOVERS, BUT THE PATRIOTS' HURT MORE. MCDANIEL HAS THREE INTERCEPTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raiders and Patriots tied for ineptitude, each turning the ball over four 
times. The Raiders won because they did a better job once New England coughed 
up the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders stumbled to a 21-17 victory Sunday in which the winning touchdown 
was set up by one of three interceptions by Terry McDaniel, who returned 
another for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the Raiders' blunders resulted in points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had four turnovers. We failed on fourth and one. We failed on third and 
one," said Raider quarterback Jeff Hostetler, who saw passes intercepted in the 
end zone and at the New England 19 and 17. "We had a lot of things go against 
us, but nobody quit." 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler's three-yard quarterback sneak with 9:34 left in the third quarter 
gave the Raiders (2-3) a 21-17 lead. Then the mistakes really began. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots lost a fumble and an interception on their next two series. The 
Raiders coughed the ball up with two interceptions and a fumble on three of 
their next four possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were a little careless and we had some penalties that hurt us very badly, 
and we had some turnovers that hurt us very badly," New England Coach Bill 
Parcells said. "The only thing that kept the game close is that they did the 
same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots (3-3) saw their three-game winning streak end but remained one 
game behind in the AFC East. The outcome was more critical for the Raiders, who 
wanted to get into the AFC West race. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not happy where we are. We want to win every game," Raider Coach Art 
Shell said. "Today when things were bad we showed we have the ability to fight 
through it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders sacked Drew Bledsoe three times and hit him even more often. He 
had his fifth 300-yard passing day of the season, going 23 for 55 for 321 yards 
and two touchdowns. But he was repeatedly under siege. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we wanted to do against him was show an attitude that when he went back 
to pass he would be hit," Raider tackle Jerry Ball said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders knew that Bledsoe was the NFL leader in passing yards and that the 
Patriot running game was weak. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew the ball would be in the air a lot," McDaniel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots kept it on the ground on the series after the Raiders took a 
21-17 lead, but that didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
 With the ball inside the one, Kevin Turner dived toward the goal line. As he 
stretched the ball forward, it hit the helmet of teammate Marion Butts, lying 
in the end zone, and bounced free. The Raiders recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Parcells said he would have to look at replays to see if the ball crossed the 
goal line while Turner had possession. 
</P>
<P>
 McDaniel picked off a pass in the right flat and returned it 14 yards for a 
touchdown that gave the Raiders a 7-3 lead. It was his second interception 
return for a score this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was was just a poor throw," Bledsoe said. "I didn't throw it hard enough, 
didn't throw it quick enough." 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots couldn't capitalize on the game's last turnover, an interception 
by Maurice Hurst with 4:23 left. But they got the ball back with 2:43 remaining 
and drove to a fourth and 20 at the Raider 48. Bledsoe's pass nearly was picked 
off by James Trapp, but fell incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders trailed by 17-14 at halftime despite having the ball for only 2:56 
in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Bahr kicked a 24-yard field goal before McDaniel scored with 11:03 left 
in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots then went 80 yards in nine plays and Bledsoe's seven-yard pass to 
Turner gave them a 10-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 On the ensuing kickoff, New England's Steve Hawkins got to the ball before the 
Raiders touched it, putting the Patriot offense on the field for the third 
consecutive series. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting from the Raider 22, New England moved to an apparent 24-yard field 
goal by Bahr. But the Raiders' Andrew Glover was penalized for unsportsmanlike 
conduct, giving the Patriots a first down at the three. 
</P>
<P>
 Bledsoe then threw to Leroy Thompson, who was hit at the goal line. It was 
ruled a touchdown, although the Raiders argued Thompson didn't cross the line. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders finally got the ball back with 1:47 left at their 28. Hostetler 
capped the drive with a short pass to Harvey Williams, who turned it into a 
27-yard touchdown at 14:18. 
</P>
<P>
 On New England's first series of the second half, the Patriots had a third and 
13 at the Raider 36. McDaniel intercepted Bledsoe's pass after it was tipped by 
Ball, giving the Raiders possession at their 36. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler's 40-yard completion to Tim Brown set up a three-yard touchdown run 
by Hostetler.

FOR RAMS, IT ALL GOES RIGHT, THEN IT ALL GOES WRONG; PRO FOOTBALL: AFTER 
LEADING THE PACKERS, 17-3, LOS ANGELES FALLS APART IN SECOND HALF, BLOWS CHANCE 
TO AT LEAST TIE IN FINAL MINUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Final minute, Lambeau Field, game on the line: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bart Starr goes over Jerry Kramer: touchdown, Packers win. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jerome Bettis runs behind Wayne Gandy: holding, Packers win. 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers' NFL title victory over Dallas on the frozen tundra in 1967 will 
long be remembered, but the Rams (2-4) will do their best to forget Sunday's 
second-half collapse, which allowed the Packers (3-3) to overcome a 17-3 
halftime deficit for a 24-17 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if we let down or they rose to the occasion," Ram linebacker 
Shane Conlan said. "Whatever, it's ridiculous. It's 17-3 and we're thinking 
pretty big about ourselves as we come in for halftime, and I don't know, maybe 
we got flat. We didn't make plays and they did." 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Robert Brooks' 85-yard punt return, the longest in the NFL this 
season, keyed the Packers' 21-point performance in the second half, but with 
1:04 remaining in the game, the Rams had the ball in position for a tying or 
winning score at the Green Bay two-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm already thinking about what two-point play we're going to call," said Ram 
quarterback Chris Miller, who threw two touchdown passes to tight end Troy 
Drayton in the first half. "But then we started going the wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller pitched the ball left to Bettis, who tried to run outside behind the 
blocking of Gandy, who had been inserted on the play as a tackle eligible. The 
Rams had run a similar play several times earlier in the game and had failed to 
gain any significant yardage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Packers knew what was coming," Ram tackle Clarence Jones said. "As we 
came to the line of scrimmage, they were yelling, 'pitch, pitch.' They had read 
something in what we were doing and they knew it was coming." 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers not only got good penetration on the play to stop Bettis for no 
gain, but received a bonus when three penalty flags flew to the ground marking 
the spot where Gandy had been caught holding. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no check-off on the play," Miller said. "Maybe they read it from the 
formation we run, or from Drayton going in motion, but we have no choice: It's 
a play we have to run when we call it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers limited Bettis, who had not practiced all week because of injuries 
after running for more than 100 yards four consecutive weeks, to 65 yards on 22 
carries. Given Bettis' physical condition and lack of success against the 
Packers, why run the pitch to the outside, a play the Packers had consistently 
stopped? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the coach, the coaches were seeing that and obviously they thought we 
could get outside and get it flanked," Miller said. "But obviously they played 
it pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 Another five-yard penalty on Jackie Slater for a false start and an incomplete 
pass to Johnny Bailey left the Rams with third and goal from the 17 with 54 
seconds remaining. Miller retreated to throw, had time and then lofted a soft 
pass into the left corner of the end zone toward wide receiver Flipper 
Anderson. The ball, however, was directed left, while Anderson turned right 
and, as a result, Green Bay cornerback Lenny McGill was able to intercept. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it will happen, it will happen to us," Conlan said. 
</P>
<P>
 After McGill's interception, Miller sat on the ground and raised his hands in 
disgust before jumping to his feet and running down Anderson for an explanation 
of what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a certain route called and got another route and I'll just leave it at 
that," Miller said. "It's just frustrating as hell. I was just trying to put 
the ball up and let us have a chance to make a play, and we ran something else 
and it got picked. That's tough to swallow." 
</P>
<P>
 Before choking on a 17-3 lead, the Rams had dominated the Packers. They had 
the hometown fans booing Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre, while Miller had 
his way against the Packers' fourth-ranked defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who took a shot in his right shoulder before the game to allow him to 
play pain-free, completed eight of 10 passes in the first half, with his only 
two incompletions coming as a result of passes dropped by Bettis. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller took advantage of a Darryl Henley interception, which gave the Rams the 
ball at the Packer 16-yard line, and threw a two-yard touchdown to Drayton for 
a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Green Bay responded with a 25-yard field goal by Chris Jacke, but Miller then 
drove the Rams 66 yards in seven plays, including pass plays of 26 and 24 yards 
to Anderson, to score on a four-yard throw to Drayton. 
</P>
<P>
 A 37-yard Tony Zendejas field goal into a 17 m.p.h. wind put the Rams ahead, 
17-3, and the Ram defense went to the locker room having given up only one 
touchdown in the previous 10 quarters of play. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get ahead, 17-3, you have to put the knife in and turn it," Ram 
safety Anthony Newman said. "We had them down, but didn't put them away." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams opened the third quarter with the wind in their faces and defensive 
tackle Sean Gilbert in street clothes on the sideline because of an injured 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams had four possessions on offense in the third quarter and failed to 
gain a first down, while being forced to punt four times. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first punt, Favre took the Packers 62 yards in nine plays and threw 
an eight-yard touchdown pass to Sterling Sharpe on third and goal. Sharpe beat 
the coverage of cornerback Todd Lyght. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the touchdown we blew a call . . . I can't say anything right now," Lyght 
said before walking away in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers tied the score moments later when Brooks brushed aside Howard 
Griffith's attempted tackle and went 85 yards with Sean Landeta's 49-yard punt. 
</P>
<P>
 Landeta suffered a shoulder injury while trying to make a saving tackle on the 
return, and appeared bothered by it on his final punt of the quarter, a 
13-yarder off the side of his foot. The poor kick turned the ball over to the 
Packers at the Ram 40-yard line and set up the winning score. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Edgar Bennett ran one yard for a touchdown 2:54 into the fourth 
quarter, and the Packers, as had the Falcons a week ago, had rallied to steal a 
victory at the Rams' expense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in control for a half," Ram Coach Chuck Knox said, "but you've got to 
be in control for 60 minutes."

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I didn't think I would be writing about a hat trick Sunday, but that sure was 
a dandy by Terry McDaniel. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Raider cornerback's three interceptions against the New England Patriots 
were one shy of the NFL single-game record set by Sammy Baugh, the quarterback, 
in 1943 and last equaled by Deron Cherry in 1985. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In his seventh season, McDaniel is on his way to a third consecutive 
appearance in the Pro Bowl and must be considered his team's best defensive 
player. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders didn't exactly put it all together on a day when they padded their 
league lead in penalties and Jeff Hostetler made about as many poor decisions 
as all last season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 However, this was a victory they needed to improve their playoff chances and 
they were able to pressure New England's talented young quarterback, Drew 
Bledsoe, into a sub-par performance. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 They might have been in a prevent defense during the Patriots' last 
possession, but they were smart enough to keep a good rush on Bledsoe. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Early in the game, NBC analyst Paul Maguire wondered aloud when the last time 
the Raiders were 1-4. Not since all the way back in 1992. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 As usual, the Rams were punchless in the second half during their 
come-from-ahead defeat to Green Bay. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In the second halves of six games, they have scored 28 points. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Jackie Slater-Reggie White matchup was fascinating, the 19-year veteran 
offensive tackle having the edge early and the perennial All-Pro defensive 
lineman finishing strong. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Any more questions about the Chargers' legitimacy?. . . . Don't count the 
Buffalo Bills out of anything, including a fifth consecutive Super Bowl. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The difference this week was that USC didn't panic against an Oregon team. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the previous Saturday when the Trojans went to the air after falling 
behind Oregon, they ran twice as often as they passed after trailing Oregon 
State, 13-2, midway through the first quarter. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The two points came courtesy of the craziest rule in the NCAA book. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Micah Phillips returned a blocked conversion kick attempt 70 yards. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It was an exciting play, but the fact that a team can score during a rival's 
point-after-touchdown attempt makes absolutely no sense. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The coaches must have been out to lunch when the rule was passed in 1988. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Brad Otton was outstanding in place of Rob Johnson during USC's 27-19 victory, 
but there shouldn't be any talk of a quarterback controversy now. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who was off to a slow start this year before suffering an ankle 
injury against Oregon, has done too many good things during his career not to 
get his starting job back Saturday against Stanford at Palo Alto. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA has had a lot of adversity this year -- and isn't reacting to it very 
well. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins seemed dispirited at Berkeley, where things went from bad to worse. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Cal lost starting quarterback Dave Barr in the second quarter, 
but substitute Kerry McGonigal, a walk-on, promptly led the Bears on a 60-yard 
touchdown drive. . . . It was only a matter of time until Arizona's lack of 
firepower caught up with it. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The architect of Colorado State's 21-16 upset victory in Tucson, Sonny Lubick, 
has become a coach-of-the-year candidate. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Lubick, in his second season with the Rams, was defensive coordinator for 
Miami's national championship teams in 1989 and 1991. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The most improbable battle of unbeatens this year could come Oct. 22 when 
Colorado State plays Utah at Ft. Collins, Colo. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 You've got to like Washington State's chances against Arizona in what might be 
the Rose Bowl decider Saturday at Pullman. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Better put a hold on Ron Powlus' Heisman Trophy. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 When Boston College is too physical for Notre Dame, maybe there's hope for 
USC. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night owls who watch Hawaii games on Prime Ticket find it hard to 
believe that the Rainbows beat Cal at Berkeley. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Kansas State quarterback Chad May, a transfer from Cal State Fullerton, looked 
terrific against Kansas last Thursday and will test Nebraska's vulnerable 
defense Saturday in Manhattan. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan running back Tshimanga Biakabutuka was born in Zaire in 1974, the 
same year that the Rumble in the Jungle between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman 
was held there. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Florida State misses Charlie Ward.

 THE WINDS OF BORE 
</P>
<P>
 The wind whisked passes far and wide, the fields were slimy and soggy, and 
those glittery, let-it-fly offenses wheezed, coughed and generally pined for 
sunny September days. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it's that time of year in the NFL, when the weather worsens, the bad 
coaches get goofy and the teams that actually can run for four yards on 
third-and-two have a significant shot at the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 You know the season has changed when . . .  
</P>
<P>
 -- Miami Dolphin quarterback Dan Marino, who had been on a record pace for 
passing yardage, throws 23 incompletions and 20 completions amid the gusts of 
Buffalo's Rich Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Written off as yet another of your usual peetered-out four-time Super 
failures, Buffalo gets two touchdowns and 129 yards from tailback Thurman 
Thomas and beats the Dolphins, 21-11, to tie them, at 4-2, atop the AFC East. 
Can you say, "January in Buffalo?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- Everybody's rookie of the year, Indianapolis' Marshall Faulk, fumbles twice 
in the Colts' bumbling 16-6 loss to the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jim Everett does nothing to prevent his team, the New Orleans Saints, from 
losing its fourth game in six tries. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tampa Bay keeps motoring powerfully toward its 12th consecutive season of 
at least 10 defeats, dropping to 2-4 with a 34-13 loss at Atlanta, and Coach 
Sam Wyche makes it worthwhile by inexplicably (except, perhaps, to him) calling 
for a field goal on the last play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 We know this was important, we just don't know why: Michael Husted's kick 
narrowed the Buccaneers' final deficit from 24 to 21 points. SLIP SLIDING AWAY 
</P>
<P>
 With the goopy grass of Soldier Field worn and torn the night before by an 
Alabama State-Jackson State game, the Saints had to figure they were in 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Because their running game has struggled even on the fast track of the 
Superdome, the Saints had to depend on Everett and kicker Morten Andersen to 
beat the Chicago Bears on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett and Andersen, not surprisingly, weren't up to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen had trouble with his footing and had two field-goal attempts blocked. 
Everett completed 22 of 39 passes for 209 yards and could not produce a second 
half score. 
</P>
<P>
 At halftime, Soldier Field employees frantically tried to improve field 
conditions. The grounds crew also struggled in attempts to repaint the 50-yard 
line, which ended up crooked from hash mark to hash mark. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the worst field I've ever played on," Everett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bear defensive end Trace Armstrong, who was credited with blocking Andersen's 
low 50-yard field-goal attempt on the last play of the first half, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a bucket and a couple of pails, you could sure build some fine sand 
castles out there," Armstrong said. "I've been playing organized football since 
I was 6 years old and I've never played on a field that bad. It's embarrassing, 
and it's dangerous to the players. It looked like they had a tractor pull." YET 
ANOTHER JETS-COLTS CLASSIC 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a game that had nothing to do with playoff positioning. 
</P>
<P>
 Colts vs. Jets. Forget about Namath and the guarantee. Forget about Unitas and 
all those other guys. Oh, how the memories of those great battles of the recent 
past flow . . . The scores: 9-6, 10-6, 6-3, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 With these two teams you never know what's going to happen when they get 
together, except that the field-goal kickers are going to be very, very 
important. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was Sunday, when Jet kicker Nick Lowery made three field goals and 
quarterback Boomer Esiason came off the bench to inspire his team despite an 
injured ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Will this go down as one of the great emotional performances of all time, 
Boomer? 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't like 1969 with Willis Reed revisited," Esiason said. "This is the 
Jets and the Colts and me. Come on!" TONIGHT'S GAME 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota vs. N.Y. Giants; 6 p.m., Channel 7 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the loss to the Cardinals last week, the Vikings (3-2) are still a 
team to fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Moon passed for 355 yards at Arizona, although he had two passes 
intercepted, and the Viking defense can be dominating. Four turnovers beat the 
Vikings last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Jack Del Rio says the defense hasn't been right lately. Maybe not, 
but opponents average only 69 yards per game rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the second half of the Miami game through last week, the last six 
quarters have been less than what we expect, and I know for sure, less than 
what we are capable of," Del Rio said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants (3-1) had a somewhat embarrassing loss to the Saints last week in 
quarterback Dave Brown's first poor start. He completed 20 of 35 passes for 180 
yards, had two passes intercepted and was sacked seven times. One of the 
interceptions was returned for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Rodney Hampton is expected to play after missing two games 
because of a bruised kidney. 
</P>
<P>
 New York's secondary has struggled after losing three starters to free agency. 
Opponents average 268.8 yards passing, and that looks good for Moon and 
receiver Cris Carter, who is among the league leaders with 41 receptions. 
NOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Favre became the fifth quarterback in Packer history to throw for 8,000 
yards. He entered the game with 7,957 and now has 8,179. Bart Starr is the 
club's all-time leader with 23,718. . . . Barry Sanders has carried 506 
consecutive times without fumbling. Sanders' last turnover came on Dec. 6, 
1992, against Green Bay. . . . Detroit return specialist Mel Gray needs five 
kickoff return yards to move into first place on the NFL all-time kickoff 
return yardage list. Ron Smith (1965-74) leads with 6,922 yards. . . . Thurman 
Thomas ran for 125 yards, the 40th time he has reached the 100-yard mark. He 
leads all active players in career 100-yard games; Sanders is second with 34. 
Thomas also surpassed 8,000 yards rushing, moving into 17th place on the NFL's 
career list ahead of James Brooks. . . . Miami quarterback Dan Marino is 9-12 
lifetime against the Bills. . . . Prior to the game, the Bills honored Mike 
Stratton by making him the ninth inductee on the team's Wall of Fame. Stratton 
played 160 games in his 12-year pro career. He is best remembered for 
delivering a hard hit on San Diego's Keith Lincoln in the 1964 AFL championship 
game. Buffalo was trailing, 7-0, at the time, but went on to win, 20-7. . . . A 
Bear quarterback was not sacked for the first time since the 1992 season 
opener. . . . The three interceptions by Atlanta, two by Vinnie Clark and one 
by Kevin Ross, gave the Falcons 15 this season, compared with 13 during the 
1993 season and 11 in 1992. . . . Jeff George's two touchdown passes gave him 
11 for the season, the most he has had since his rookie year in 1990 when he 
finished with 16. . . . Ironhead Heyward's two rushing touchdowns represented 
the first time a Falcon has run for two scores since Steve Broussard did it 
against the Rams late in the 1991 season. . . . Former Cowboy stars Randy White 
and Tony Dorsett were inducted into the team's Ring of Honor during halftime 
ceremonies. White and Dorsett entered the Pro Football Hall of Fame on July 30. 
There are 10 names on the Ring of Honor at Texas Stadium: White, Dorsett, Tom 
Landry, Bob Lilly, Don Meredith, Don Perkins, Chuck Howley, Mel Renfro, Roger 
Staubach and Lee Roy Jordan. . . . Troy Aikman's first-quarter touchdown pass 
to Daryl Johnston marked the 11th consecutive game in which Aikman has thrown 
for a touchdown. That ties Danny White for the third-longest streak in club 
history. Staubach and Meredith hold the team record with 12. . . . Emmitt Smith 
has scored at least one touchdown in seven consecutive games, matching the club 
mark of Frank Clarke and Bob Hayes. . . . Denver has won four in a row against 
Seattle and eight of the last 11. . . . Leonard Russell's 103-yard effort was 
the first 100-yard rushing game for the Broncos since Rod Bernstine's 103-yard 
effort at Chicago last Dec. 18, the last time the Broncos won. . . . Drew 
Bledsoe's 321 passing yards gave him 4,566 for his career, moving him into 
fifth place on the Patriots' career list. Hugh Millen dropped to sixth with 
4,276. Jim Plunkett is fourth with 9,932. . . . Tim Brown's two catches gave 
him 251, seventh most in Raider history. Next in line for him to pass are Art 
Powell (254) and Dave Casper (255). . . . Joe Montana's 55 passing attempts 
matched his career-high. . . . Former San Diego Coach Don Coryell, whose 
innovative passing game was nicknamed "Air Coryell," was inducted into the 
Chargers' Hall of Fame at halftime. . . . Charlie Garner became the first Eagle 
rookie to rush for at least 100 yards in consecutive games, following up his 
111-yard effort in his first start last week against San Francisco with 122 
yards against Washington. MOTOR CITY MEDICINE 
</P>
<P>
 Were the 49ers experiencing grisly flashbacks to their 40-8 drubbing last week 
by the Eagles when the Lions waltzed to an early 14-0 lead Sunday at Detroit? 
</P>
<P>
 Naw. Maybe against any other team, but not the Lions, who have lost five 
consecutive games to San Francisco, including last year's 55-17 stinker. 
</P>
<P>
 With San Francisco in desperate need to cure its ills, the Lions, as usual, 
were the perfect medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers and rookie fullback William Floyd barreled back against the Lions 
and suddenly, the 49ers, with a needed bye week awaiting them in a few weeks, 
are 4-2 and looking like a solid prospect to blow past the pretenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing is easy for us right now, but we're hanging in there," 49er 
quarterback Steve Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not easy being down, 14-0, on the road, but we've got some guys on the 
team who have been around a long time. We knew that we didn't need to scream 
and panic. We just had to get going." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Lions are going in the other direction: They have lost three in 
a row since their uplifting overtime defeat of the Cowboys last month. AND THIS 
TOO, SHALL COME TO PASS (AND BE INTERCEPTED) 
</P>
<P>
 Before Buddy Ryan does any more boasting, it'd be a good idea for him to have 
the quarterback to back it up. 
</P>
<P>
 That might take a while, though. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the Cowboys' 38-3 dumping of the Cardinals, Ryan was pelted by 
popcorn. But the Dallas Cowboy defense was pelted repeatedly too: By wayward 
footballs thrown by Cardinal quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Starter Jay Schroeder completed only one more pass to his own receivers (four) 
than to Cowboys (three). 
</P>
<P>
 Of Dallas' four first half touchdowns, three were set up by Schroeder 
interceptions on successive possessions deep in Arizona territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona reliever Steve Beuerlein, a former Cowboy and a former decent 
quarterback, threw two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 And as the Cardinal quarterback carousel continues to spin, who gets the start 
next week? 
</P>
<P>
 "Beuerlein will start next week," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Cardinals playing at Washington, Redskin defensive backs should be 
prepared for anyone. INJURY REPORT 
</P>
<P>
 To make things worse for the Cardinals, kicker Greg Davis was helped off the 
field Sunday after pulling his hamstring on kickoff coverage. Ryan said the 
injury was serious enough that the Cardinals will have to sign another kicker 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Also injured Sunday: San Francisco safety Merton Hanks (broken nose), who left 
the game but returned, and Indianapolis linebacker Quentin Coryatt (neck), who 
did not return, New England guard Doug Skene (torn ligaments in his left knee) 
and Detroit tight end Ron Hall (sprained left knee). CLOSING THOUGHTS 
</P>
<P>
 -- It must be great to be 34 years old and out of the winless column. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels great," Denver quarterback John Elway said after the Broncos 
defeated the Seattle Seahawks, 16-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Elway can be forgiven, since it was the Broncos' first victory in nine months 
and kept them in the AFC West race, four games behind the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 " It's been a long time since we won a game," Elway said. "It's an especially 
big win if we build on it next week." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Phil Simms got put in his place by his old coach, Bill Parcells, on ESPN's 
pregame show. Simms, who, judging by this week's performances could be starting 
for about 10 teams, was sent by ESPN to do a feature on Drew Bledsoe, hot young 
quarterback for Parcells' New England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
 When Simms noted to Parcells that Simms almost joined the Patriots last year, 
then asked where he'd be today if he had, Parcells shook his head and merrily 
answered: 
</P>
<P>
 "Sitting on the bench."

THOMAS' SCORE HITS THE SPOT FOR BILLS; AFC: A WELL-BEHAVED COX IS HIS VICTIM ON 
26-YARD RUN, AND DOLPHINS ARE BEATEN, 21-11. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bryan Cox held his temper but couldn't hold on to Thurman Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas broke free from Cox's grasp late in the third quarter for a 26-yard 
touchdown, his second score of the game, to help the Bills defeat the Miami 
Dolphins, 21-11, on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first victory for a home team in the last seven meetings between 
Miami and Buffalo, who have met 21 times with the AFC East division lead on the 
line. They now are both 4-2 and tied for first. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four years now, they've been the best team in the AFC," Miami Coach Don Shula 
said. "For us to be the best team we've got to win a game like this, and we 
didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 With so much at stake, the rivalry has gotten ugly -- but never more so than 
last year, when Cox responded to alleged racial slurs with an obscene gesture 
to the Rich Stadium crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday marked Cox's first visit to Buffalo since the incident, and he promised 
to handle the fans with more class this time. In that, he succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was saying this was Bryan Cox vs. Buffalo, but there were two good 
teams out there," he said. "I kept my composure, and frankly I didn't even pay 
attention to what they were saying. I thought it was important that I come out 
and show my team that I wasn't going to be distracted today. . . . I came here 
to play football." 
</P>
<P>
 After four consecutive weeks of getting flagged for 15-yard penalties, Cox 
kept it to an offsides against Buffalo. Despite calling Thomas a jerk on a 
Buffalo radio show, he helped him up after a run. Cox also gave Buffalo's 
Kenneth Davis a high-five after his fourth quarter touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him after the game that I was glad he handled it the way he did," 
Buffalo center Kent Hull said. "I have a lot of respect for Bryan Cox. He had 
an outstanding game. He made tons of plays. I think he showed a lot of class 
the way he controlled himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, who sat out last week with a sprained knee so he would be ready for 
the Dolphins, ran 31 times for 125 yards -- his fourth consecutive game with 
more than 100 rushing yards. With the wind causing trouble for both 
quarterbacks, the Bills abandoned their no-huddle offense after two series and 
ran 48 times for 214 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't what you do . . . it's how you play that counts," Buffalo Coach Marv 
Levy said when asked about the change in strategy. "Our players played their 
rear ends off. That's why we won." 
</P>
<P>
 With less than a minute to go in the third quarter, O.J. McDuffie fielded a 
Bills' punt at his own 21 yard-line but Mark Pike knocked the ball loose. After 
a scramble, Buffalo's Bucky Brooks wound up with it at the Miami 26. 
</P>
<P>
 On the next play, Thomas ran straight ahead and into Cox's arms. But Cox went 
for the shoulder tackle and Thomas slipped loose, heading to the outside and 
going into the end zone without being touched again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills added another touchdown midway through the fourth quarter, with 
Davis running it in from the five to make it 21-3.

LOWERY GETS MILESTONE FIELD GOAL IN NICK OF TIME; AFC: KICKER'S THIRD OF GAME 
MOVES HIM PAST 1,500 POINTS IN CAREER AND BREAKS LATE TIE EN ROUTE TO JETS' 
16-6 VICTORY OVER COLTS.

<P>
 That annual comedy of errors, Colts vs. Jets, played the Meadowlands again 
Sunday. It was as laughable as ever, until New York provided a few twists at 
the end. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets ended a five-year home losing streak against Indianapolis with a 16-6 
victory. Until a late touchdown, the game had all the elements of other recent 
Colts-Jets matchups that wound up 9-6, 10-6, 6-3 and 6-0. Both teams often fell 
victim to their ineptitude on offense, rarely even managing a first down until 
New York's winning drive. Fumbles, penalties and interceptions bogged down both 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nick Lowery made three field goals, making him the third player in history 
with more than 1,500 points, and backup running back Adrian Murrell provided a 
boost for New York in the fourth period. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did know that it was 9-6 last year. That's just the way this team plays," 
Lowery said. "It's a matter of time before our offense finds its stride." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets (3-3) might have run out of time if not for Murrell, who ran for 65 
yards, nearly all of it in the final quarter, in his first extended action of a 
22-game pro career. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really my first time toting the ball this much," the speedy back said, 
"so it felt good. If I can keep giving the team a spark, I'll get more chances 
down the road. They won't be afraid to use me the next week." 
</P>
<P>
 The score was tied, 6-6, at halftime and stayed that way as the Colts' usually 
reliable Dean Biasucci missed a field goal from 35 yards in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Murrell then sparked the decisive march, rushing for 15 yards and turning a 
short pass into a 12-yard gain on third down despite having little blocking on 
the play. Lowery's 37-yard kick came with 6:23 to go and lifted him over the 
1,500 point mark, trailing only George Blanda and Jan Stenerud. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback James Hasty, who has struggled this season, then helped clinch it 
by forcing a fumble by Floyd Turner at the Colts 25 with 5:36 remaining. Hasty 
recovered, then Murrell broke a 19-yard run. On third down, Johnny Mitchell 
caught a one-yard touchdown pass from Boomer Esiason to clinch it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look forward to that kind of opportunity," said Mitchell, whose only catch 
Sunday was the touchdown. "Coach believed in me and I believed in myself. It 
was very satisfying." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a gimpy ankle that sidelined him last week, Boomer Esiason replaced 
the befuddled Jack Trudeau at quarterback late in the second quarter and led 
the Jets to all but three of their points. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall Faulk ran for 93 yards in 20 carries, but he also fumbled twice for 
the Colts (2-4). He showed glimpses of his breakaway skills, but often had 
nowhere to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "This game actually fell on my shoulders and I lost it," said Faulk, the 
second pick overall in this year's draft. "I can take the blame for it." 
Getting His Kicks 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Lowery's three field goals and one extra point Sunday for the New York 
Jets made the 16-year veteran the third player in NFL history with more than

BRONCOS GET FIRST VICTORY, 16-9; AFC: DENVER BREAKS SEVEN-GAME LOSING STREAK 
DATING BACK TO LAST SEASON BY DEFEATING SEATTLE, LEAVING CINCINNATI AS THE ONLY 
WINLESS TEAM. 
</P>

<P>
 The Denver Broncos took a lot of pressure off themselves and their embattled 
coach, Wade Phillips, on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 At least for a week. 
</P>
<P>
 They got their first victory of the season -- breaking a seven-game losing 
streak dating back to last season -- by defeating the Seattle Seahawks, 16-9, 
Sunday. The Broncos' victory left Cincinnati, which had a bye this week, as the 
NFL's only winless team. 
</P>
<P>
 In Denver, Phillips' job was rumored to be in jeopardy. So after several weeks 
of taking the heat, the Broncos savored the win, their first since last Dec. 18 
at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels great," John Elway said. "It's been a long time since we won a game. 
It's an especially big win if we build on it next week," when Denver plays 
Kansas City on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Elway scored on a short run and Jason Elam kicked three field goals for the 
Broncos (1-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Elway, Elam and the Broncos got plenty of help from the Seahawks (3-3), who 
went into the game No. 1 in the NFL with a plus-nine in the takeaway-giveaway 
ratio. But on Sunday they committed five turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks lost three fumbles, two by Michael Bates, and Rick Mirer was 
intercepted twice. Three of the five Seattle turnovers led to 13 of Denver's 
points. Steve Atwater, Denver's four-time Pro Bowl free safety, had an 
interception and a fumble recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The 34-year-old Elway scored on a two-yard run with 43 seconds left in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Elway's touchdown proved to be the difference as Elam kicked field goals of 
26, 33 and 37 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks got their points on John Kasay field goals of 37, 36 and 42 
yards. It was the first time since Dec. 20, 1992, a 10-6 loss to the Broncos, 
that Seattle failed to score a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos led, 10-3, at halftime on Elway's touchdown run on a rollout 
around right end. Elway eluded Rafael Robinson in the flat on a play-action 
play and went into the end zone untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was lucky the defensive back (Robinson) fell down so I could use my 6.3 
speed to get in there," Elway joked. 
</P>
<P>
 A Robinson holding penalty nullified a sack of Elway at the Seahawks' 12 on a 
third-down play that would have forced Denver to kick a field goal. Instead, 
Robinson's penalty gave the Broncos the ball on the Seattle 2 and Elway scored 
on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver drove 70 yards in eight plays in 1:36 for its first-half touchdown 
after Atwater recovered a Bates fumble after he caught Mirer's pass at the 
Denver 13 and returned it 17 yards. The drive featured a 32-yard pass from 
Elway to Sharpe.

VETERAN GIVES SHULER COSTLY LESSON; NFC: EAGLES' GREG JACKSON INTERCEPTS 
REDSKIN ROOKIE'S PASS TO PRESERVE 21-17 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The veteran safety baited the rookie quarterback into a mistake, and the move 
cost the Washington Redskins an upset and preserved a victory for the 
Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Jackson, the longtime New York Giant who signed with the Eagles as a free 
agent in the offseason, intercepted Redskin quarterback Heath Shuler's pass at 
the Philadelphia three with 40 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 The play gave the Eagles their fourth consecutive victory, a 21-17 decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made him think I was going to the middle of the field, but I knew they were 
going to the weak side," Jackson said. "When I saw it was going to the side, I 
said, 'I've got it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson leaped in front of Desmond Howard and caught the ball, ending a 
Washington drive that started at the Redskin eight with 1:48 left and had 
progressed to the Philadelphia 33. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never elevated like that," Jackson said. "I thought I was too heavy for 
that. The last time I did that, I was in high school and I weighed 170 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Shuler, who finished 10 of 27 with 186 yards and two touchdowns, said Jackson 
made a great play. "We had two chances to get in the end zone," he said. "We 
thought we'd have two chances. We didn't think they'd get an interception." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's interception sealed a victory that the Eagles (4-1) won with a 
running game that outgained the Redskins, 193-55. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Garner became the first Eagle rookie to rush for at least 100 yards in 
consecutive games, following up the 111-yard effort in his first start last 
week against San Francisco with 122 yards in 28 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Garner left in the fourth quarter after reinjuring the sore rib that kept him 
out of most of the preseason and the first three regular-season games. He was 
unsure if he would be ready to play next weekend against Dallas.

ROOKIE LEADS 49ERS PAST LIONS; NFC: FULLBACK WILLIAM FLOYD SCORES TWICE, PLAYS 
KEY ROLE IN 27-21 COMEBACK VICTORY. 
</P>

 William Floyd, a rookie from Florida State, scored his first two NFL 
touchdowns, caught several passes and provided Steve Young with enough 
protection to overcome a 14-0 deficit and guide the San Francisco 49ers to a 
27-21 victory over the Detroit Lions on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he has a few things to learn. Floyd was scolded by Coach George Seifert 
after each of his finger-pointing touchdown celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't play without being excited, and that's exactly the same thing I would 
do at Candlestick," Floyd said. "I'm a rookie, so they won't let me talk in the 
huddle yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Young, who was sacked 15 times in the first five games, was sacked only twice 
by the Lions (2-4), who lost their third consecutive game. The 49ers (4-2), 
rebounding from last week's 40-8 loss to Philadelphia, won their fifth in a row 
against the Lions, including a 55-17 drubbing last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing is easy for us right now, but we're hanging in there," Young said. 
"It's not easy being down, 14-0, on the road, but we've got some guys on the 
team who have been around a long time. We knew that we didn't need to scream 
and panic." 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd, starting at fullback ahead of Marc Logan, carried eight times for 35 
yards. He also caught five passes for 43 yards. His two touchdowns came on 
one-yard runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd also helped out as a blocking back as Young, instead of trying to throw 
downfield, worked on quick, short passes that didn't require as much time to 
set up. As a result, Young completed 19 of 25 for 152 yards, including a 
five-yard touchdown toss to Nate Singleton. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky Watters had 44 yards in 16 carries, including a four-yard touchdown, and 
Jerry Rice caught five passes for 36 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions, wearing the throwback uniforms they wore for a Monday night victory 
in Dallas three weeks ago, scored on their first two possessions.

SAINTS HAVE A BAD DAY ON CHICAGO'S BAD FIELD; NFC: PLAYING ON TORN-UP TURF, 
WALSH LEADS BEARS TO 17-7 VICTORY OVER HIS FORMER TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Playing in a sandbox known as Soldier Field, Steve Walsh remained undefeated 
as the Chicago Bears' starting quarterback and exacted revenge against the team 
that shunned him. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing his third consecutive game for injured Erik Kramer, Walsh directed two 
second-half scoring drives and the Bears took advantage of their torn-up turf 
for a 17-7 victory over the New Orleans Saints on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I downplayed it all week, but when you play against a former team, it's a 
sweet victory," said Walsh, who was cut by the Saints after spending two 
seasons with them as a third-stringer. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 16 of 26 for 174 yards despite aggravating a hip injury and playing on 
a field that was ravaged by Saturday evening's waterlogged Alabama 
State-Jackson State game. Most of the grass was worn away, and layers of sand 
put down by the grounds crew made things even worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the last three or four weeks, I've decided not to look at any weather 
reports, not to worry about the field, and play in any conditions we get," said 
Walsh, who is trying to keep the starting job even after Kramer -- a big-money, 
free-agent acquisition -- returns from a separated shoulder. "In about a month, 
it's going to be ugly." 
</P>
<P>
 In about a month, the Bears (4-2) hope they're still in first place in the NFC 
Central. They have a half-game lead over the Minnesota Vikings, who are in New 
Jersey tonight to play the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis Tillman rushed for 100 yards and a touchdown for the Bears, who didn't 
seem as adversely affected by the field conditions as a New Orleans team that 
plays its home games in the Superdome. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints (2-4) led, 7-0, early in the third quarter and it should have been 
more. Morten Andersen, one of the best kickers in NFL history, struggled with 
his footing and had two field goal attempts blocked. The Saints also were 
slipping on offense and sliding on defense as the Bears scored the final 17 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Trace Armstrong blocked Andersen's low 50-yard attempt on the last play of the 
first half, and Jerry Fontenot blocked a 37-yard attempt 3:21 into the second 
half.

IRONHEAD PROVES HIS METTLE IN 34-13 VICTORY; NFC: FALCON RUNNING BACK, WHO HAS 
LOST 60 POUNDS IN A YEAR, RUSHES FOR 87 YARDS AND TWO TOUCHDOWNS AGAINST 
BUCCANEERS.

 Craig (Ironhead) Heyward gave the Atlanta Falcons' coaching staff just what 
they expected when he went into the starting lineup for the first time this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a load in there," Coach June Jones said after watching Heyward pound out 
87 yards and two touchdowns on short runs in a 34-13 victory over the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gives them something to think about when he breaks into the secondary," 
Jones said. "I noticed some guys were trying to nail him on the ankles." 
</P>
<P>
 Heyward, who weighed 328 pounds last year and was fighting a drinking problem, 
has quit using alcohol and dropped to 265 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an OK day, but I think there are things I can get better at," Heyward 
said. "My philosophy about playing is as long as I'm out there, I'm happy. 
Whatever I can do out there to help us be a better team, I'm all for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Vinnie Clark also contributed to the Falcons' third victory in a row, 
returning interceptions 74 and 21 yards to set up 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory left the Falcons (4-2) tied with San Francisco for the NFC West 
lead. The two teams meet in Atlanta next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff George threw two touchdowns passes to offset two interceptions and a lost 
fumble, and Atlanta took a 24-0 lead late in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark's interceptions helped the Falcons become the latest team to shut down 
Tampa Bay (2-4). The Buccaneers' offense has scored only seven touchdowns this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark set up a touchdown and a field goal with his interceptions. His 74-yard 
return was the seventh-longest in Falcons' history. 
</P>
<P>
 George threw touchdown passes of 36 yards to Andre Rison in the first quarter 
and 32 yards to Terance Mathis in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Heyward, who also caught three passes for 37 yards, opened the scoring with a 
one-yard run 5:01 into the game, ending a 74-yard drive. The key play was a 
pass interference call on ex-Falcon Charles Dimry in the end zone, a 32-yard 
penalty that gave Atlanta a first down on the one. 
</P>
<P>
 Heyward's other touchdown, on a five-yard run, made it 24-0 with 1:04 left in 
the half. The score followed Clark's 21-yard interception return of rookie 
Trent Dilfer's fluttering pass.

DALLAS: HEY, BUDDY, TAKE THAT; NFC: COWBOYS HAND RYAN HIS WORST LOSS AS AN NFL 
HEAD COACH, ROUTING CARDINALS, 38-3.

<P>
 Buddy Ryan's seven-game hex on the Dallas Cowboys ended Sunday with his worst 
loss as an NFL head coach. The humiliating rout had the fans sarcastically 
chanting "Buddy, Buddy, Buddy" even before the first quarter was over. 
</P>
<P>
 At the game's merciful end, they pelted him with popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmitt Smith, playing despite a sore right hamstring, scored twice and Troy 
Aikman threw two touchdown passes as the Cowboys (4-1) ended a seven-game 
losing streak to Ryan with a 38-3 victory over his Arizona Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35-point loss was Ryan's worst, eclipsing 32-point decisions to Chicago 
and the New York Giants in 1987 when he was head coach of the Philadelphia 
Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can say this was a great lesson in humility," he said. "We were run over by 
an 18-wheeler." 
</P>
<P>
 Fans, who had tossed pork chops and water balloons at Ryan in previous visits 
to Texas Stadium, gave him a popcorn shower as he exited. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought our defensive game plan stunk and that's my fault," Ryan said. "We 
played terrible. Dallas made a lot of big plays, and I made a lot of bad 
calls." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Cowboys' eighth consecutive victory over the Cardinals (1-4), and 
the 35-point differential tied a 45-10 defeat of the St. Louis Cardinals in 
1973 as the largest inflicted on the franchise by Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you eat the bear and sometimes the bear eats you," said Dallas 
Coach Barry Switzer. "Today we ate the bear. We proved we have the No. 1 
defense in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan dominated Dallas when he was at Philadelphia and went into the game with 
an 8-2 record against the Cowboys. But his pregame boast that the Cardinals 
would handle the defending world champions quickly looked silly. 
</P>
<P>
 He gave the booing crowd a big thumbs up before the game started, but his head 
was hanging by halftime. His offense produced only two first downs, and his 
second-ranked NFL defense looked bad. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys rocked the Cardinals with four touchdowns in the first half, three 
of them following interceptions of Jay Schroeder, who hurt his shoulder on his 
third interception and was replaced by former Cowboy Steve Beuerlein. 
</P>
<P>
 Beuerlein was intercepted twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety Darren Woodson, a rookie from Arizona State, and four-year veteran 
cornerback Larry Brown, from Los Angeles High and Texas Christian, had two 
interceptions, one off Schroeder and one off Beuerlein. 
</P>
<P>
 James Washington, from Los Angeles' Jordan High and UCLA, had the Cowboys' 
fifth interception. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beuerlein will start next week," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman said it was the Cowboys' best game since the Super Bowl. "We played as 
good today as we've played in a long time," Aikman said. "Our receivers did a 
great job against Buddy's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got hit a lot because I had to stay in there against the blitz, but it was 
worth it. I haven't played a Ryan team yet when I didn't get hit a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman completed 16 of 22 passes for 231 yards before Rodney Peete came on in 
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith ran only nine times for 22 yards before retiring at halftime, turning 
duties over to Lincoln Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith has started 73 consecutive games for Dallas. It was his decision to sit 
out the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the lead that we had, there really wasn't any need for me to play," 
Smith said. "It was nice not to have to play so much so I could rest my 
hamstring."

SENIOR GOLF; ZARLEY OVERTAKES AOKI TO WIN TRANSAMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The winner was a man Bob Hope once called "the pro from the moon" and whose 
27-year-old daughter and caddie was a baby when he last won a tournament here. 
</P>
<P>
 The loser was a man who shot a 29 over the last nine holes and then joked in 
Japanese that he forgot to wear his favorite television outfit. 
</P>
<P>
 Kermit Zarley birdied the par-five 18th hole in a playoff against Isao Aoki on 
Sunday to earn the $90,000 winners' check in the Transamerica senior tournament 
at the Silverado Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Zarley's first senior championship and the second time he has won at 
Silverado. In 1968, Zarley won the PGA Kaiser tournament on the same course and 
earned $25,000 for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Zarley spent the day trying to catch Aoki, whose final-round 63 tied the 
tournament record held by Bob Charles and Dale Douglass. Aoki finished with a 
12-under 204. 
</P>
<P>
 Zarley two-putted the par-five 18th hole for a birdie and a final round 66 to 
force the playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a problem out here on the senior tour of collapsing in the clutch," 
Zarley said. "My putting has been the thing that has held me back. I've been 
timid. Today, I wasn't like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Zarley's final drive proved to be the key. Teeing off first in the playoff on 
the 500-yard 18th, a dog-leg left that snuggles up against the clubhouse, 
Zarley hit a draw down the right side of the fairway that landed about 240 
yards from the pin. 
</P>
<P>
 When Aoki hooked his tee shot into the trees, it was virtually all over. 
</P>
<P>
 After Aoki missed a 25-foot putt for a birdie, Zarley tapped in his two-foot 
birdie putt, raised his black panama hat to the crowd and hugged Christy, his 
daughter and caddie. 
</P>
<P>
 Christy was six months old when Zarley last won at Silverado. She helped her 
father on Sunday by easing the tension. When Zarley's approach shot landed in a 
foot of water on the ninth hole, Christy said, "Come on, dad, play it." 
</P>
<P>
 Zarley roared with laughter and saved par to finish the front nine at eight 
under. He birdied the next two holes, as well as the 13th, to close to within a 
stroke of Aoki. 
</P>
<P>
 Zarley, whom Hope once called "the pro from the moon" because of his unusual 
name, joins Billy Casper as the only players to win both a PGA and senior tour 
event at Silverado. 
</P>
<P>
 Aoki, from Tokyo, had been hoping to win his first tournament since the 1983 
PGA Hawaiian Open and the 1992 senior Nationwide Championship.

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; NEW CHAMPION MCCALL SIMPLY WANTS TO BE LIKE MICHAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Until not long ago, Oliver McCall was merely another talented heavyweight 
among the talented heavyweights thrashing around in the pit. 
</P>
<P>
 He got into trouble and broke the law. At 29, he had derisively -- and, given 
his record, aptly -- been sneered at as "just another sparring partner" by 
then-World Boxing Council heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 McCall could always throw a solid right cross -- he knocked down Mike Tyson in 
a training session with the punch when Tyson was preparing for Michael Spinks 
-- but he could always mess himself up too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really do feel in my heart that I should've been champion a long time ago," 
McCall said on a conference call. "But I stopped myself from doing it. And I 
suffered through not doing it, but I learned and I grew as a man. 
</P>
<P>
 "So from that growth and hard-core growing up, I've changed and now I want the 
good side of it." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, the Chicago native was sentenced to 60 days in jail for breaking and 
entering and, over the next several years, his record dropped from 11-1 to 15-4 
as he sputtered through what should have been his prime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have talked about that (in speeches to students)," McCall said of his jail 
time. "I tell the students it isn't all about your accomplishments, it's about 
doing what you can do with what you're blessed with. I've come a long way and 
I've still got a long way (to go). 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I put it to youngsters, there are mistakes you've made, can be made, 
will be made. You have to regroup and do what has to be done. That's the way I 
go about life, period. There's a lot of other positive things you can do, other 
than doing things that can harm you and be costly." 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago, McCall landed a right cross hard to Lewis' jaw, sending him 
to the canvas for an eventual second-round technical knockout. And suddenly, 
Oliver (the Atomic Bull) McCall had gone from no-name to one-third heavyweight 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he is promoted by Don King, who is eagerly awaiting the release from 
prison of Tyson, McCall widely has been disparaged as a caretaker champion 
merely keeping the throne warm for Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to say a lot of different things, but I know one thing, someone 
who takes my title, they have to beat me, " McCall said. "I don't think anybody 
can beat me, I don't care who he is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I beat the best. I know someone will come along down the road who is 
better than I am, eventually. But I'm going to slide out the back door after 
four, five fights and retire with the championship." 
</P>
<P>
 McCall's plan is simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm only planning on fighting about three or four more fights," McCall said. 
"I just want to retire with the belt, with my honor, being the best I can be, 
like Michael Jordan did. I'm the Atomic Bull, he was a Chicago Bull, both from 
Chicago . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Once I fight Tyson and beat Tyson, I can retire with my head up." 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, King has lined up the usual suspects for McCall. Tyson said 
recently that he won't jump into a title fight immediately and might want to 
work his way into shape with 10 or 20 tuneups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want him to be at his best," McCall said of Tyson. "One fight, 20 fights, 
100 fights, then I'll take what's mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter McNeely, a virtual unknown, might fight McCall in January. Bruce Seldon, 
a better-known journeyman, might be next. Lionel Butler, another untapped, 
undisciplined mountain of talent, could be in there too. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't McCall worried that if he keeps fighting nobodies, he never will be 
respected? 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody knows them? Nobody knew me!' McCall said. "There's a lot of nobodies 
that can really be somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 Why not plan such fights, King asks. After a boxer with five losses beats 
Lennox Lewis, and when 45-year-old George Foreman is challenging Michael Moorer 
for the other two-thirds of the heavyweight title -- the World Boxing Assn. and 
the International Boxing Federation versions -- isn't anything possible? 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, unification plans are vague and extremely unlikely, given the 
promoters' desires to maintain their shares of the heavyweight crown in these 
uncertain, pre-Tyson months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The heavyweight division is in the worst shape," King said. "It's dismal. It 
is abysmal. Anybody on any given day can win. Nobody really believed, other 
than me, Jimmy Adams (McCall's manager) and Oliver McCall, that he would be 
heavyweight champion today. Yesterday's nobody is tomorrow's somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, King and McCall immediately shot down an offer from Lewis' 
promoter, Dan Duva, to guarantee McCall $10 million if he agrees to a rematch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of wasting his time baby-sitting the title by fighting Moe, Larry and 
Curly for chump change, McCall should step up to the plate and fight a real 
fight for serious money," Duva said. "The only way McCall will ever see this 
kind of payday is if he breaks into King's house." 
</P>
<P>
 McCall said he wouldn't give Lewis a chance to regain his title if he were 
offered $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now they come with their tail between their legs, with the money to get back 
into the picture, to try to reinsure the mistake they already made by trying to 
fight me in the first place," McCall said 
</P>
<P>
 "First, Lennox Lewis disrespected me by (blaming) the referee (for a quick 
stoppage). . . . Nobody told him to lay down on his back in the first place, 
then get up like a bowl of spaghetti dropping down to his legs." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Rock Newman, manager of former champion Riddick Bowe, has been furiously 
trying to get his man, generally considered the most talented heavyweight in 
the world, back into title contention. 
</P>
<P>
 To do that, he has to get on the good side of King, whom he had previously 
disdained. 
</P>
<P>
 His most recent effort has been to publicly suggest that he would give King a 
piece of Bowe's future earnings if King gives Bowe a shot at McCall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll see what happens as Rock moves down the line with Riddick Bowe," King 
said. "I'd be delighted to talk to Rock Newman and Riddick Bowe any time they 
should so desire." Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar De La Hoya, after taking seven weeks off -- and canceling a fight for 
the third time in two years -- to recover from a virus, recently began training 
at Big Bear for his Nov. 18 appearance on the Roy Jones-James Toney undercard 
and dismissed criticism that he is too quick to back out of long-planned 
fights. "I'm a fighter who, if he's not in shape and 100%, I'm not going to go 
up there," De La Hoya said. "I'm not going to put up with promoters' . . . . 
It's my life and if I'm not ready, I'm not fighting. It's as easy as that." 
</P>
<P>
 The initial symptoms of the virus, De La Hoya said, were severe headaches, 
nothing any fighter ever wants to experience. "I took a brain scan, they took 
pints of blood out of me, everything," De La Hoya said. "It was very scary. But 
all my brain cells are there. . . . The doctor said I had a virus, and a lot of 
people have been misunderstanding what the doctor had said. People were 
thinking I had a really deadly virus. They would ask me, 'Do you have AIDS?' 
No, no, no, I don't have AIDS. It was a virus and I am over it." 
</P>
<P>
 Julio Cesar Chavez's next fight will not be against Frankie Randall but 
against former world champion Tony Lopez, Dec. 10, in Monterrey, Mexico, King 
said. Why won't Chavez fight Randall, who has repeatedly said that he believes 
he deserves a third shot against Chavez, who has said he agrees? "Right now, 
it's Lopez because we want a fight in Mexico. Tony Lopez, after that great 
fight he had with (Greg) Haugen (a victory last June), that put him in position 
for this," King said. "Randall can defend (his newly won World Boxing Assn. 
junior-welterweight title) a couple of times and then we can bring him and 
Chavez back for a unification, I think, way down the line." 
</P>
<P>
 King also said he will soon formalize plans to stage the third Humberto 
(Chiquita) Gonzalez-Michael Carbajal fight "somewhere in Mexico," probably in 
Mexico City, on Nov. 12. That card probably will include the long-delayed title 
defense of WBA junior-lightweight champion Genaro Hernandez against Jimmy 
Garcia, a bout that originally was to have taken place in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavyweight prospect Jeremy Williams has settled a contract dispute with his 
former manager, Bill Cayton, and signed with Top Rank, Inc. Williams is also 
scheduled to fight on the Jones-Toney undercard.

GOLF ROUNDUP; CANADA SURPRISES U.S. TO WIN DUNHILL CUP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Canada took advantage of blunders by Tom Kite and Fred Couples to upset the 
defending champion United States and win the Dunhill Cup team-play tournament 
Sunday at St. Andrews, Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory completed an improbable run that began when Canada upset a Nick 
Price-led Zimbabwe team in the qualifying round. The Canadians then beat 
Germany and, earlier Sunday, ousted South Africa in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of stunned," said Canadian captain Dave Barr, who shot a 70. "We 
kind of bucked the odds. We didn't care about the ranking of this guy or that 
guy. We just went out and did what he had to do to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Kite, two strokes behind Barr after 16 holes, lost his match by one after 
making a double bogey on No. 17. Couples missed a three-foot putt on No. 16 and 
also ended up one stroke behind Ray Stewart, who had a 71. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Canadian victories made Curtis Strange's seven-shot victory over Rick 
Gibson meaningless. Strange closed with a 67 on Sunday.

 Rick Fehr ended an eight-year victory drought on the PGA Tour, shooting a 
four-under 68 to win the $1.1-million Disney Classic by two shots over Fuzzy

</P>
<P>
 Fehr, who has finished second at seven tournaments since 1991, had not won 
since the B.C. Open in 1986. His 19-under 269 earned him $198,000.

 In La Boulie, France, the American team led by 46-year-old Allen Doyle and 
18-year-old Tiger Woods ended five years of frustration for the United States,

<P>
 After finishing second the last five years, the U.S. team turned its one-shot 
lead at the start of the final round into an 11-shot winning margin.

 Doyle, Woods, John Harris and Todd Demsey wound up with a 23-under 838 total 
for four trips over the 6,734-yard, par-72 French National course.

OAK TREE AT SANTA ANITA; SANDPIT GIVES BRAZIL SOMETHING TO SAMBA ABOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brazil produces coffee and soccer players and inspires movie makers and 
composers, but it never has produced a racehorse who has done much in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil's long wait for a substantial thoroughbred might be over. After 
Sandpit's 1 1/4-length victory Sunday in the $300,000 Oak Tree Invitational at 
Santa Anita, Jose Luiz Pinto Moreira, the director of the Brazilian breeders 
association, said: "This horse may be the best one we've ever sent to this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-year-old white-faced chestnut beat four others in the 1 1/2-mile race in 
a way that makes trainer Richard Mandella regret that he wasn't nominated for 
the $2-million Breeders' Cup Turf at Churchill Downs on Nov. 5. It would cost 
Sandpit's owner-breeder, construction engineer Sergio Menezes, a supplementary 
fee of $400,000 to make the horse eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Oak Tree, Menezes left the Breeders' Cup door slightly ajar, but 
instead of that race Mandella seemed resigned to getting an invitation to run 
in the Japan Cup in Tokyo on Nov. 27. The purse is $3.5 million and the entry 
fee is only $2,700. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandpit, ridden by Corey Nakatani, won in 2:25 and earned $180,000, which was 
about $68,000 more than his purse total for 14 previous races. He won four of 
12 starts in Brazil before Mandella started him at Del Mar this summer, for a 
second-place finish in his debut and a five-length victory in a minor stake on 
Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandella trained Kotashaan, winner of last year's Oak Tree and the 1993 horse 
of the year and grass champion in North America, and reports of his overall 
success with turf horses reached Menezes, who sent two horses to the Santa 
Anita-based trainer. Mandella and Menezes didn't meet until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandpit arrived in California shortly after finishing fourth in the $317,000 
Gran Premio Carlos Pellegrini, one of Brazil's premier races. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know much about him," Mandella said, "and I knew that I hadn't seen 
that many horses from Brazil run well here. But his record showed that he had 
run well in the Pellegrini under a lot of weight (132 pounds). . . . We just 
took our time with him until he was ready to run." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandpit paid $4.80 as the favorite over the second choice and second-place 
finisher, Grand Flotilla, who might still have earned a trip to the Breeders' 
Cup. It was seven lengths after Grand Flotilla to Approach The Bench in third 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Stevens, who rode Grand Flotilla, guided Supremo to a neck victory over 
Desert Mirage in the $200,000 Norfolk Stakes later in the day. Supremo's 
stablemate, Strong Ally, was a nose out of third. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the 25th edition of the Norfolk and has been called the weakest, with 
no unrestricted stakes winners in the field. Supremo's time of 1:43 2/5 for 1 
1/16 miles was three-fifths of a second slower than the time the filly Serena's 
Song posted Saturday in the Oak Leaf. But Richard Mulhall, who trains both 
Supremo and Strong Ally, made no apologies for suggesting that Supremo will run 
in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile on Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "The top horses back East are the same horses we've been running against," 
Mulhall said. "On Target beat us by only a half-length in the Del Mar Futurity. 
Timber Country beat us by a half-length (when Supremo was third) in the Balboa, 
and we finished ahead of Timber Country in the Del Mar Futurity. So there will 
be no big surprises for us in the Breeders' Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Timber Country won Saturday's Champagne at Belmont Park, becoming the favorite 
for the Juvenile. On Target had a troubled trip while finishing third in the 
Champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 Supremo, running coupled with Strong Ally, paid $3.40 and earned $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time I've had the chance to train Supremo when he wasn't 
sick," Mulhall said. "He was coughing before the Balboa (at Del Mar on Aug. 
24), and we almost didn't run him, but the cough went away a few days before 
the race. Then he started coughing again, and I missed 10 days (of training) 
with him before the Del Mar Futurity (on Sept. 14)." Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Valenzuela, absent from riding the last three days, has been replaced by 
Chris Antley aboard Eliza for today's $100,000 Lady's Secret Handicap at Santa 
Anita. Valenzuela told the stewards at Belmont Park, where he was scheduled to 
ride Saturday, that he was suffering from food poisoning. He told Santa Anita's 
stewards that he couldn't ride Sunday because he missed his flight from New 
York. Valenzuela, who has a history of drug abuse, once rode under contract for 
Eliza's owner, Allen Paulson, who canceled the arrangement because of the 
jockey's repeated absences. Valenzuela has been aboard for all four of Eliza's 
stakes victories, including the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies in 1992. 
Valenzuela was not listed on any horses on Wednesday's card. . . . Hollywood 
Wildcat is the 4-5 morning-line favorite in today's five-horse Lady's Secret. 
She's won only one of four starts since winning last year's Breeders' Cup 
Distaff at Santa Anita.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; FROM POTBOILER BEGINNINGS TO WORTHY LITERARY THRILLER; THE 
RIVER SORROW BY CRAIG HOLDEN DELACORTE PRESS $21.95, 378 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS GOODRICH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Craig Holden found himself in financial straits a few years back, 
according to the publicity material that accompanies the pre-publication 
galleys of "The River Sorrow," he resolved to write, under a pseudonym, a 
quick-money detective story. 
</P>
<P>
 He never finished the book: The cash crisis eased, and more significantly, the 
characters Holden invented for mercenary reasons began to take on lives of 
their own.  
</P>
<P>
 Conceived as a potboiler, "The River Sorrow" became a literary thriller -- and 
a good one, as it turns out, for this is one first novel that's quite likely to 
keep you up half the night. 
</P>
<P>
 The central figure is Dr. Adrian Lancaster, who lives in a small Michigan 
city, Morgantown, 90 miles west of Detroit. Lancaster is not, however, a 
stereotypical country doctor: He's an emergency-room trauma specialist, for one 
thing, and a former heroin addict and small-time dealer, having been introduced 
to drugs while in medical school by his chemistry-whiz lover, Denise. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster is by no means at peace with himself -- he still misses Denise, who 
disappeared after rescuing him from career-threatening drug charges -- but 
Lancaster has at least begun to redeem the past: It was a delusion, he 
realizes, to think that running a high-class, sterile shooting gallery while in 
med school made him "a kind of capitalist Albert Schweitzer of the 
counterculture." 
</P>
<P>
 He now devotes himself to saving lives, not only in the emergency room but 
also in a drug-treatment center where he volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 The novel's direction is obvious from the get-go -- Lancaster will be forced 
to revisit a past he'd sooner forget, to rectify youthful mistakes, perhaps, or 
at least tie up loose ends. 
</P>
<P>
 He does so soon after witnessing in the emergency room what seems to be 
fall-out from a new drug war; a number of users and runners have suddenly come 
to grisly ends, their deaths linked to the reappearance of a very potent form 
of synthetic heroin known on the street as Fang. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster encounters many of the drug-culture bodies, barely living and 
thoroughly dead, early in "The River Sorrow," and these passages are as 
compelling as they are bloody. (Holden knows the hospital environment well, 
having been a lab technician in a Toledo medical center.) 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster tries to maintain the doctor's clinical view of these violent 
deaths, but when he realizes that many of the corpses are connected to his 
addict days, he smells a setup. He panics and goes underground, hoping to 
unravel the mystery for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster is an interesting and original figure, but the character who really 
stands out is Frank Brandon, the cop who initially hopes to nail him. Brandon 
has a chip on his shoulder, having been passed over for the police chief's job 
and seen his family virtually destroyed in a Quaalude-induced car accident, but 
he knows when evidence adds up too neatly.  
</P>
<P>
 Brandon keeps his ideas to himself, however, not trusting either the sheriff's 
department or the federal drug investigators who descend quickly -- too quickly 
-- on the various murder scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 His silence proves golden: There is indeed a conspiracy, one involving 
government officials, but Lancaster proves to be merely a bit player. Someone 
is trying to flush Detroit's kingpin drug-pushers into the open, but who, and 
why? 
</P>
<P>
 Holden throws everything but the kitchen sink into "The River Sorrow," from 
corrupt politicians, lawless federal agents and figures in mysterious disguises 
to snowmobile drug deals, high-speed shootouts and tape-recordings from the 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Although these tough-guy characters and spectacles can be a bit much, they 
never go over the top, so the novel generally retains its plausibility, up to 
and including the revelation of the identity of the evil genius behind the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosure comes as something of a surprise, but not entirely, because 
Holden has a way of making the unexpected seem inevitable. Doctors who use 
heroin? Cops who act with deliberation? Someone who devotes years to perfecting 
appropriate vengeance? 
</P>
<P>
 The potboiler origins of "The River Sorrow" are unmistakable, but Holden has 
transcended the genre with aplomb.

TENNIS / BILL DWYRE; SENIOR TOUR MAY SOON BE DUBBED 'GREAT LET OF LIFE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is not yet the lucrative senior golf tour, referred to affectionately by 
Jim Colbert as "the great Mulligan of life." But the senior tennis tour has 
completed its first year, and its founding father, Jimmy Connors, pronounces it 
well and growing. 
</P>
<P>
 It is called the Champions Tour, with sponsorship by Digital PC, and it makes 
a stop this week at the prestigious Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 It starts Wednesday night, with two matches: Guillermo Vilas-Tim Gullikson and 
Roscoe Tanner-Larry Stefanki. The next day, after two more afternoon matches, 
the current star of the show and frequent winner of these events, Connors, 
takes to the court to play the Vilas-Gullikson winner. 
</P>
<P>
 And, very likely, that will be the time for spectators to get a full picture 
of the competitive nature of this over-35 tour, because, where there is 
Connors, there will always be that burning fire of competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you know anything about me, you know I'm never going to walk out on that 
court and give less than 110%," he said recently during a conference call 
interview. "First of all, there's $150,000 in prize money, not exactly chicken 
feed. Then, you have to know that there are 10, 12, maybe 20 guys out there 
where, if you're not in shape or not quite ready to play tennis on this level, 
they're set to step right in and take your place." 
</P>
<P>
 The business side of Connors, who created this tour with the help of friend 
and financial adviser Ray Benton, actually is hoping for more of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the guys on the (ATP) tour now, guys in their early 30s having a 
tougher and tougher time, to start thinking about the Champions Tour," he said. 
"Matter of fact, the way some of these guys are burning out and breaking down 
after about six or seven years on the tour, we may have to make it an over-30 
tour." 
</P>
<P>
 The 11 stops this year could easily grow into 18 or 20 in the next few years, 
according to Connors, and the anticipated presence of additional name players 
such as John McEnroe, Yannick Noah, Andres Gomez and Ivan Lendl could quickly 
take this to another level of fan interest and corporate backing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those guys are all talking about playing a couple of Champions events next 
year," Connors said. "That would be nice. New blood. Fuel the fire for the guys 
playing now. And it would add lots of credibility to our tour." 
</P>
<P>
 After Wednesday night's start, the event has day-night sessions Thursday, 
Friday and Saturday and the final Sunday afternoon, starting at 1. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Connors got a bit feisty when, during the conference call, he perceived a 
question to be comparing his 1991 run to the semifinals of the U.S. Open with 
Andre Agassi's run to the title this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't compare 1991 to anything," he said. "It took me 22 years of hard work 
to get to that, to have 22,000 people on their feet, screaming, there just is 
no comparison." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The great tragedy of the Champions Tour, of course, was the recent loss of 
Vitas Gerulaitis, who died Sept. 18 of carbon monoxide poisoning in New York a 
few days after competing in a tour stop in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerulaitis did his last interview with free-lance writer Mimi Shachat and, 
among the things he said in that Sept. 15 discussion, printed recently in New 
York magazine, was that, in his heart, he never really left the tennis tour, 
even though he got too old for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "After you leave the tour, you miss your friends," he said. "My saddest days 
were when I knew my tennis-playing days were at an end. I love hanging with the 
guys. . . . It's sort of a celebration of a good period in your life." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically and sadly, Gerulaitis also said, "I love to entertain. Once it's in 
your blood, you never lose it. I'm single, rather be in a hotel. I don't even 
own my own home. Actually, I'm a gypsy. And to be perfectly honest, I have the 
greatest life." Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Capriati is alive and well in her new home in the Palm Springs area, 
has slimmed down and, despite a few nagging injuries, is playing every day. 
Also, she has a new dog that chews up her tennis shoes. No word, however, on 
exactly when she will make her tour comeback. . . . The Amateur Athletic 
Foundation has a junior tennis league in conjunction with the U.S. Tennis 
Assn., and the year-round program, for youngsters who live mainly in depressed 
areas, recently began its September-November session. . . . Was there sad irony 
the other day in Martina Hingas' first tour victory being over Patty Fendick? A 
14-year-old beats one of the few college graduates out there playing?

A FAREWELLTO ARMS?; HIS SMILE IS CHARMING, HIS MESSAGE WELCOME: IF SOUTH AFRICA 
CAN WORK FOR PEACE, SO CAN NORTHERN IRELAND. BUT IS GERRY ADAMS THE RIGHT 
MESSENGER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Britons know Gerry Adams and his cease fire. 
</P>
<P>
 They say he's a fascist, an Irish executioner with a peace initiative that's 
just another cheap ploy. Because they have seen his shoulder beneath the 
caskets of dead terrorists and for 25 years have mourned hundreds bombed by 
Gerry's kids in Northern Ireland's pubs and chip shops, England's hotels and 
offices. Even Harrod's, one bloody Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, Americans celebrated their Gerry Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 Editorials and cheering audiences called him the great, courageous hope for 
peace in Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 They back-slapped this tall, bearded, rough-cut nationalist whose past is only 
alleged and thus may be ignored. In glittering hotels and an Irish pub they 
raised champagne and beer glasses to Adams as a shrewd, dogged freedom fighter 
no different from Nelson Mandela and Yasser Arafat, therefore just as deserving 
of Washington's clout in restoring freedom and democracy to his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, in an empty banquet room at the Century Plaza Hotel, over scrambled 
eggs ("Ah!") and hash browns ("What are these?") Gerry Adams, controversial 
president of Sinn Fein, political megaphone for the Irish Republican Army, 
spoke of Gerry Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 His portrayal as a thug, he says, is a caricature drawn by Britain's "right 
wing and the reactionary press . . . not (by) the very democratic, progressive, 
liberal element in British politics which recognizes the need to end British 
rule in Ireland." 
</P>
<P>
 But there have been published reports of Adams the teen-age soldier who in 
1979 became head of the IRA's Army Council. That was the year Lord Mountbatten 
died when a terrorist bomb exploded his yacht in Sligo. 
</P>
<P>
 As was his father, so Adams has been shot by Protestant guerrillas and 
imprisoned for suspected terrorist involvement. Grenades have been thrown at 
his West Belfast home -- all of which seems to go beyond reasonable dissent 
within the career of an ordinary politician. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams does not bristle at the suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have consistently, and on the record, denied and disputed that (terrorist 
allegations)," he says. "And I was, in the High Court in Belfast, acquitted of 
such a charge." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams says he's just a political activist, his protests rooted years ago 
against apartheid in South Africa and the Vietnam War. That, he says, makes a 
man do what a chosen servant of a struggle has to do "through a sense of duty . 
. . probably, if I think hard enough, I have to confess that I never envisaged 
myself performing this type of role." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter trans-Atlantic polarization and colorization -- and British 
officials advised Washington to refuse Adams a visa to visit the U.S., citing 
its own terrorist concerns that still bar Adams from entering Britain -- the 
richness of Adams' current role is undeniable. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 31, he stunned all sides and splinter groups of the Northern Ireland 
conflict -- known traditionally and coyly as "the troubles" -- by announcing 
the IRA's "complete cessation of military operations." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams was a co-engineer of the cease fire. It followed months of hidden 
negotiations with Britain, with Protestant leaders in the six counties 
comprising Northern Ireland, and with Albert Reynolds, prime minister of the 26 
counties forming the Republic of Ireland to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRA olive branch was extended 10 months after Reynolds and British Prime 
Minister John Major agreed that talks on the future of Ireland, north and 
south, to maintain separate countries or reunite a nation, could be held with 
the Sinn Fein. 
</P>
<P>
 But talks only would commence after 90 days of unbroken IRA cease fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "The current situation has been described, I think very graphically, as space 
in which hope can grow," Adams says. He is exhausted by jet lag, 
breakfast-to-midnight appearances, a permanent preoccupation with personal 
security, and now only coffee and passion for the cause is keeping him 
vertical. "I think my role is to widen that space, and deepen that space, and 
allow that very delicate seed to flourish." 
</P>
<P>
 And for five weeks -- despite the provocation of recent bomb and bullet 
attacks and killings by Loyalist guerrillas -- the cease fire has held and the 
peace seed is sprouting. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there remain general concerns about IRA sincerity. Does "complete 
cessation" mean "permanent cease fire?" If Loyalist paramilitary groups launch 
major offensives, how long can Republican weapons remain silent? 
</P>
<P>
 And after 25 years of fighting, after 3,160 killed and 36,000 wounded on both 
sides, with IRA guerrillas undefeated and 15,000 British troops holding their 
ground, why should anybody quit now? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that everyone wants peace and I don't think I have any monopoly on 
that," Adams says. "Peace is in fact, a political thing. Peace comes when you 
have certain conditions which nurture, which sustain . . . and (when there is) 
absence of the cause of the conflict, the process of justice and equality." 
</P>
<P>
 Peace has also been known to break out when terrorists grow weary of no-win 
civil wars. Or when new generations look back in frustration at the sins of 
their fathers, and when financial and political support wane. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are rumors that the IRA is underfinanced and divided, that this 
paramilitary minority within a civilian minority no longer represents the 
majority wants of even Catholics in Northern Ireland. So rather than ending 
British control of Northern Ireland, the popular sentiment could be for 
evicting the IRA. 
</P>
<P>
 "To even suggest that any of that is part of the situation would be to make a 
grave mistake," Adams cautions. "I think you have an undefeated IRA, 25 years 
old, competent, undivided and undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stalemate that you describe is not a valid description of the situation. 
I said over 15 years ago there could be no military victory, by either side. 
And a British minister echoed that some eight or nine years later when he said 
the IRA could not be militarily defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 "So if there's no military victory, no military solution, then we need a 
political fix." 
</P>
<P>
 That fix, Adams emphasized at every school, every cocktail party on his 
diagonal whistle-stop from Boston and New York, to San Francisco and Los 
Angeles, is the Sinn Fein (Gaelic for "By Ourselves") platform -- British 
troops out of Ireland, unification of North and South, and a new constitution 
with a bill of rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "It must be a new Ireland, an agreed Ireland, and the people have to decide 
this Irish Republic," is Adams' way. "And based on the 1916 proclamation (by a 
Marxist-Socialist group opposing British rule) which upholds the right of the 
people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland, the right of our children to 
education, to the right of people to economic freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams denies that Sinn Fein's new Ireland would be organized along 
Leninist-Marxist lines but insists "we need a transformation and I think the 
Dublin government acknowledges that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not to be aware of the shadows of Adams' past is to be charmed by the man. He 
is articulate, shrewd, and as polished as another famed Irish politician, John 
F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his one-liners are apt to repeat, although the same quotations and 
word-plays appear in most presentations, Adams massages his speeches to the 
interests of each group. 
</P>
<P>
 To Harvard students he noted the contribution of business to the economic 
stability of all government and nations. At Berkeley it was the value of 
youthful, virile protest. To Show Coalition, an organization of entertainment 
industry activists, he appealed for an end to movie portrayals of Irish men who 
"never get quite sober" and Irish women as "always very beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 And as have politicians before in their crusades for glamorous support, as has 
President Clinton, Adams held Hollywood's hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Thursday's arrival at LAX -- there was California champagne and 
Guinness in the back of a limousine to celebrate Adams' 46th birthday -- the 
Sinn Fein group drove to a home off Mulholland Drive for drinks among and with 
the stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver Stone -- bearing no offers to make a movie on the life and times of 
Gerry Adams -- Sean Penn and Martin Sheen were there. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams has a sly sense of humor. When a page for "Gerry Adams" echoed through 
LAX, he said: "It's nice to be traveling under an alias." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams had great patience for a television reporter who asked: "What is Sinn 
Fein? Is that the name of someone?" 
</P>
<P>
 He expresses little patience for the British and that has created a major 
mischief in his life. He is married, a father, but draws no salary from Sinn 
Fein. Technically Adams is unemployed, last known job tending bar at the Duke 
of York pub in Belfast. 
</P>
<P>
 So, except when traveling on expenses, he receives $110 a week in unemployment 
benefits from the British government. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Adams is diplomatic enough to include "my Protestant brothers and sisters" 
in the proposed new Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He shows great cultural polish by starting and ending each speech with Gaelic 
greetings and farewell. 
</P>
<P>
 American audiences rose to his canny reminders that Irish-America has given 
this country a dozen presidents, that the IRA struggle in Northern Ireland is a 
counterpart of the American Revolution with the identical enemy, and that the 
first person to be processed at Ellis Island was Irish. 
</P>
<P>
 And in asking for America's support and mediation -- which, Adams noted, makes 
every American a contributor to the freedom of Ireland -- he is expecting no 
less than what was earned by Mandela and Arafat. For if Jews and Arabs can find 
agreement in the Middle East, if there is a new coexistence among black and 
whites in South Africa, why not a union of Protestants and Catholics, Loyalists 
and Republicans, in a new and united Ireland? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course it is going to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have built a very solid foundation with well over 25 years involved in the 
struggle and I don't envisage failure," he insists. "The foundation . . . has 
been done in a step-by-step way, sometimes too slowly, sometimes intolerably 
slow. 
</P>
<P>
 "But nonetheless . . . had I come here five years ago and told you that 
Mandela, who was then in prison, a convicted political prisoner, that he would 
be president of a new, democratic South Africa, you could have been excused for 
being skeptical." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he says, the British government needs to find a counterpart to former 
President F.W. de Klerk, whose administration and understanding produced that 
new South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that wherever he or she is, this is their moment, this is that time 
in our history where someone can grasp it and move it forward, and then we can 
all build upon the momentum and the foundation," Adams says. "Where there's a 
political will, and especially where there's a goodwill, no conflict is 
intractable." 
</P>
<P>
 Then when, this settlement? Adams leaves plenty of space. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly . . . as we approach the millennium," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams believes the best visions go forward and never look back. He is 
confident that the world has seen the last tears of Northern Ireland's crying 
game. And inherent to Republican dreams, he says, are the words of Bobby Sands, 
an IRA gunman who starved to death in 1981 after a prison hunger strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stand on the threshold of a new, trembling world," wrote Sands. "Let our 
triumph be the freedom of all, let our revenge be the laughter of our 
children."

BANKING ON A RECIPE OF CLASS AND CHEESECAKE; IMAGES: PHOTOGRAPHER KEN TOWNSEND 
BREAKS GROUND BY GETTING THE FIRST SWIMSUIT CALENDAR FEATURING BLACK WOMEN INTO 
MAJOR BOOKSTORES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN AUBRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tracie Tyler said, "No way." 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Hudson wanted no part in something she figured was yet another 
dressed-up scheme to exploit black women. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelle Brooks balked at the idea of exposing her "chunky" hips and thighs for 
consumers around the country to see. 
</P>
<P>
 But photographer Ken Townsend convinced all these women -- and 10 more -- that 
they were just what he and his partner, Brian Skyers, were looking for to grace 
the pages of their swimsuit calendar, "The Darker Image." 
</P>
<P>
 And the result is a deft enough balance of class and cheesecake to become the 
first black female swimsuit calendar to make it into national bookstore chains. 
"The Darker Image" is one of only four swimsuit calendars Barnes & Noble bought 
for 1995; it will share shelf space with calendars by Anna Nicole Smith, Kathy 
Ireland and Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most black calendars I'd seen depict black women negatively. They're not 
really something you'd want to have hanging in your house," said Hudson, a 
veteran model who appears on the cover as well as inside the calender. "But 
black models are always downplayed, always given the basic JC Penney outfit." 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend, a 26-year-old UCLA law student and Crenshaw District native, said 
what he conceived as a business venture became something of a crusade to get 
black women a corner of the beauty-imaging market. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our job to glorify black women because magazines aren't doing it," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Darker Image" seems a sure contender in the fiercely competitive calendar 
wars. Its titillating mix of surf-and-flora locales and exquisite models are 
photographed with enough soft-edged light and strategic poses to render even 
the obligatory thong shot aesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see images of black women, they're usually either put-upon urban 
mothers or rap-video sluts, but rarely just gorgeous people," explained 
Townsend, a mile-a-minute talker. "That always bothered me, especially since so 
many women try to copy the physical attributes of black women. The relatively 
few black supermodels like Naomi Campbell are essentially white ideals of black 
beauty. Doing the calendar seemed like a way for us to start leveling the 
playing field." 
</P>
<P>
 At least some of corporate America has been willing to see the light. Townsend 
and Skyers have cracked top bookstore chains -- an essential step for 
large-scale calendar distribution -- and have sold the bulk of their 10,000 
copies of "The Darker Image" to Barnes & Noble and Waldenbooks, which are 
placing them alongside swimsuit calendar mainstays such as Sports Illustrated 
in about 600 outlets in 20 states. An additional 3,500 copies are going to 
liquor stores, barber shops and newsstands. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Costello, calendar buyer for Barnes & Noble, says it's about time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market is crying out for it," said Costello, whose company also owns 
Scribner's, Doubleday, Brentano's and Bookstar. "It's rare that you can say in 
the business, 'This is needed, there's nothing else like it.' In this case, it 
was true." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Needed or no, Townsend said it was a tough sell -- but one well worth the 
effort. He believes that simply having his product displayed in mainstream 
outlets will begin realigning consumers' thinking and literally make them see 
that black women are just as sexy and glamorous as their white counterparts. 
And while some would hardly call Townsend's product social progress for African 
Americans, the photographer insists that it is because he is striking at the 
most rudimentary and pervasive of all stereotypes: that black is simply not 
beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just never seen that way -- sexy and sensual," said Theressa Rice, an 
African American actress and poet who perused the calendar at the Culver City 
Bookstar. "In the media, it seems like we're either the bitch, the straight 
woman or businesslike to the point of being unfeminine. Uptight. It's like 
we're afraid of showing softness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at this and I'm inspired to accept myself more. I wrestle with my body 
image every day, but looking at this, I feel like I could model in it." 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone views the calendar as a giant step for black womankind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a non-issue," said publicist Bernice Sanders, who lives in the Fairfax 
District. The swimsuit calendar "is something I never really thought was a good 
idea. Black people have too many other things to do and be." 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend said the scarcity of black women in glamour industries has made 
stereotypes of them as sex toys that much more glaring, especially in recent 
years: scantily clad bumpers and grinders in 2 Live Crew and Big Daddy Kane 
videos, incarnations of the rap-bred "bitches and ho's" imagery. 
</P>
<P>
 Costello said that is exactly the sort of imagery he steered clear of as 
Barnes & Noble hunted for a high-caliber black calendar. He rejected the dozen 
or so that crossed his desk in an average year, including Howard Morehead's 
perennially popular but decidedly risque "Bronze Beauties." 
</P>
<P>
 "The quality of this one sold me," Costello said. "It had to be something we 
could put on our shelves and not look disappointing. But we also didn't want to 
buy a black calendar just because it was black." 
</P>
<P>
 And rightfully so, Skyers said. "My friends are all glad that somebody finally 
did a black calendar right, that here's something that can really compete with 
similar products," he said. "The question now is how people will react to it. 
They don't necessarily realize that they've been conditioned to expect blond 
hair and blue eyes in a context like this." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, neither Townsend nor Skyers had any thoughts of launching a 
business project, let alone a swimsuit calendar. Friends since their University 
High School days, Townsend was a high-powered entertainment attorney in the 
making and Skyers a budding civil engineer from View Park. But Townsend said he 
realized during a crucial Century City law firm internship that he wanted 
"something more than a big desk and a secretary . . . both Brian and I wanted 
to make money, but independent of the system." 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend got the idea for the calendar one afternoon as he lounged at home 
flipping through TV channels. Idly watching Black Entertainment Television 
music videos, he was struck by the fact that he rarely saw alluring black women 
except in the confines of the occasional -- and fleeting -- love-ballad video. 
</P>
<P>
 For the calendar project, Skyers agreed to put up the bulk of the capital and 
Townsend, a skilled but admittedly unseasoned photographer, would do the 
artwork. 
</P>
<P>
 The first calendar in 1994 turned modest profits at independent stores, 
military bases and college campuses, but both partners say this year's version, 
with the coveted national distribution, will be the real test. The partners 
plan to donate a portion of the proceeds to the nonprofit Parents of Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend said the acceptance he's looking for is less from "crossover" white 
consumers but black ones, especially men. "We want to get black males to 
appreciate a quality image of black woman," he said. "We have to get away from 
the mind-set that buying something black automatically means buying cheaper or 
lower quality." 
</P>
<P>
 Regae Clark, a 37-year-old black musician who picked up the calendar at a 
recent street festival, said products such as "The Darker Image" should help to 
undermine that acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is beauty, not exploitation," he said. "I love looking at beautiful 
black women . . . so do a lot of other guys. Hey, if you've got it, you should 
flaunt it."

JACK SMITH: IN THE GREAT COSMIC SCHEME OF THINGS . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In wondering the other day about why we are here (a subject plainly beyond my 
philosophical reach), I suggested that if God is infallible -- as many of us 
believe -- why did he do such a bad job of it when he created humankind? 
</P>
<P>
 Why, I asked, did he create two sexes, and leave the procreation of the 
species to sexual union, an arrangement that causes all kinds of trouble. I 
have received several letters scoffing at this question, some suggesting that I 
myself must have enjoyed that arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 "You dangerously strolled into Abby's and Ann's domain this morning," writes 
Michele Yepiz. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sexual union is, to my mind," writes Frank Wentink, "although I have been 
unable to indulge for some years because of the infirmities of old age, still 
remembered as the most glorious of all sensations when indulged in by two 
persons who love each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously," he concedes, "even people who don't love each other must find it 
so, judging from the large number of illegitimate children being born in these 
times. After reading your column for many years it is difficult for me to 
imagine you never enjoyed sex." 
</P>
<P>
 Perish the thought. That is the trouble with sweeping philosophical 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet that is exactly my point. If sex were not so enjoyable, it would not be so 
widely practiced, and the world would not be moving toward a dreadful 
population explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Earth's population today is increasing at the rate of three persons per 
second, or about a quarter of a million every day. That will be an increase of 
one billion by the year 2000. Where are we going to put us? 
</P>
<P>
 Supposing God had arranged that men and women did not produce children by 
having sex, but by washing the dishes together? Surely that would cut down 
considerably on the birth rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, we didn't have dishes until the species was several thousand years 
old, but surely God could have found some other, less enjoyable way to 
procreate. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me leave the question of why we are here for a moment to consider three 
other questions of cosmic consequence reported by the press in the past week. 
</P>
<P>
 First, astronomers have discovered that the universe is only about half as old 
as many of the oldest stars and galaxies it contains. That is a paradox. We 
have always thought the universe included everything. Every last particle. How 
can it be younger that some of its parts? 
</P>
<P>
 I'll leave that one to the astronomers.  
</P>
<P>
 The second startling news story was about the discovery of the missing link. 
For decades, scientists have been searching for the bones of a creature that 
links human beings and the apes. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they think they have found it in Ethiopia. It is only a handful of teeth 
and skull fragments, but they are about a million years older than any other 
bones found in the human family tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "This species," says Tim D. White, a paleontologist, "is the oldest known link 
in the evolutionary chain that connected us to the common ancestor (we share) 
with the living African apes." 
</P>
<P>
 Creationists who doubt Darwinian theory have always thrown "the missing link" 
at scientists who insist evolution is not theory, but fact. "Where's the 
missing link?" they'd say. Now, evidently, we have it. 
</P>
<P>
 The third news story, in the New York Times, is rather more disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
 About a billion years from now, it says, the sun's increasing brightness may 
evaporate Earth's water. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on its way to becoming a red star, the sun will burn its various gases, 
with periodic explosions. Finally, some 12.4 billion years after its birth, it 
will undergo the last of its spasmodic helium explosions. The dying sun will 
form "a planetary nebula, a small hot stellar remnant." 
</P>
<P>
 "Further cooling will leave the sun as a white dwarf," the article says, 
"consisting of matter so dense that one cubic inch would weigh about 10 tons. 
At the end of the trail the sun will become a black dwarf orbited by the 
cinders of its former planetary system, including the frozen remnant of the 
long lifeless Earth. There Earth will continue to spin, perhaps forever." 
</P>
<P>
 I was discussing these matters at lunch with Herb Henrikson, a Caltech 
scientist, and asked him what he thought about the inevitable end. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was reminded of the story about the little old lady who was 
informed that all these dreadful things would happen in 12 billion years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh dear!" she exclaimed. "In only 12 million years!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Twelve billion years, not million," she was informed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God!" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the scientists quoted by the New York Times said: "Fortunately we 
still have lots and lots of time." 
</P>
<P>
 To do what?

COMMITMENTS: FALLEN FRIENDSHIPS; YOU SWORE YOU'D BE BEST PALS FOREVER, BUT IT 
WENT SOUR. AND THE PAIN IS VERY REAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE KNOWLTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can't think of the person without a sickening lurch in your gut. You 
alternate between angrily wishing you'd never met the Judas and agonizing over 
what went wrong. It hurts when mutual friends bring up the person's name, when 
they tell you about the fun times you weren't invited to and wouldn't attend 
even if you were. 
</P>
<P>
 You have all the sloppy symptoms of a broken heart. 
</P>
<P>
 But you don't go to marriage counseling -- you're not married. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't go to family counseling -- you're not related. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't go to couples counseling -- you're not lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't even suggest to the person any counseling at all, lest you be 
thought insane. 
</P>
<P>
 You're "just friends," so there's no one to talk to about your shattered 
psyche, no words like ex-lover or ex-husband to legitimize your nemesis, no 
socially acceptable ritual to mourn the loss of the trusted confidant you once 
held dear. 
</P>
<P>
 Friendship -- in other times and places lauded as passionately as romantic 
love -- today takes a cultural back seat to every other important relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite society's alleged nonchalance, the loss of a friend can cut more 
deeply than losing a lover. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt totally betrayed and completely lost," says editor Justine Kaplan, 33, 
of Corona del Mar, whose best friend, hurting from a Kaplan matchmaking attempt 
that went awry, told her that she no longer wanted to be friends. "I didn't 
understand. You're not supposed to just stop being friends with someone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to say, 'What the hell is this -- you're breaking up with me?' " 
</P>
<P>
 She sighs. "With a lover, you can call them up later and say 'let's be 
friends.' But when a friend rejects you, what's left to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Any review of the popular media yields reams of articles on how to survive the 
breakup of a love match, but almost none on losing a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't surprise University of South Carolina social psychologist Keith 
Davis, who has been researching friendship breakups for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a cultural bias," he says. "Researchers don't look at it and people 
don't write about it." 
</P>
<P>
 He says his in-depth studies revealed two typical ways friendships end. 
</P>
<P>
 One is a "gradual growing apart, like where someone moves and doesn't stay in 
touch," he says. "The other is a betrayal, which in many ways feels quite 
similar to the experience with a lover." 
</P>
<P>
 The betrayals fall into three categories: stealing one's lover, not being 
there when needed and the misuse of personal things, including property and 
secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever the betrayal, Davis says, working it through can transform the 
friendship into something better than it was. 
</P>
<P>
 "About half of my subjects said they were able to successfully repair the 
relationships," Davis says. "In the other half, what's learned is that the 
person can't be trusted and they don't want to be around the person ever 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Davis says anger and sadness are the most common emotions 
felt when friendships end. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nature of the emotion depends a lot on the specifics of the 
relationship," he says. "At the minimum you're angry because you've been let 
down. And you become very sad because you thought you had a friend you could 
count on." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most people in the United States don't really suffer over losing 
friends, says Gene Gordon, a Washington, D.C., psychoanalyst and clinical 
professor at George Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
 "Friendship is just not highly valued here," he says. "Breaking up means 
you're close to someone but since most people aren't close, they don't feel the 
breakup. It's not like in places like Central America, where friendship is 
taken much more seriously. Here, friendships are taken very casually." 
</P>
<P>
 In genuinely close friendships, Gordon says, it's natural to feel "extremely 
attached and very dependent." Therefore, breakups of those relationships are 
indeed traumatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary and lonely and awakens all the traumas of separation we've ever 
experienced in childhood," he says. "This doesn't mean one is immature. Very 
often, it speaks paradoxically to the maturity of the adult, that the 
friendship was that intimate to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon says he doesn't know why our culture devalues friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand it," he says. "There's a great deal of value placed on 
independence and individuality and not a lot placed on support. People are very 
lonely in the United States of America." 
</P>
<P>
 Not having outlets to discuss friendship's end makes breakups all the more 
difficult, says Stacey J. Oliker, author of "Best Friends & Marriage" 
(University of California Press, 1989). "Love relationships are 
institutionalized and people who participate in them acknowledge the emotional 
investment. Friends don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Oliker says that while there have been periods when friendships were "far more 
romantic, when the sentiments were expressed in the language of love and 
adoration," there has never been a time or culture that acknowledged the 
consequences of friendship's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has never been the social institution of divorce in friendship," she 
says. "So people are left without guidelines, help or advice to deal with the 
emotional upset." 
</P>
<P>
 And the upset is real, Oliker stresses. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are often a lot more emotional ramifications than anticipated," Oliker 
says. "But often, because the feelings and conflicts in friendships aren't 
acknowledged, people don't even realize why they're upset. They may attribute 
the feelings to something else." 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Cooper, 57, a retired El Segundo aerospace engineer, quietly says he isn't 
sure why he ended the best friendship he ever had 10 years ago or how he really 
felt afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 But his voice becomes highly animated when he recalls the man who had been his 
confidant and bridge partner for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "We developed the best partnership and it was just wonderful," he says. "I 
worked harder at that partnership than I did at my first marriage. He was the 
best friend I've ever had and then I just blew it." 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't a fight or disagreement that caused Cooper to drift away from 
the relationship. Rather, it happened after his friend stopped playing bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to be a marathon runner and couldn't take the smoke-filled rooms 
anymore," Cooper says. "I understood his decision. We broke up playing bridge 
and it wasn't a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 But after that, Cooper repeatedly turned down his friend's invitations to come 
for dinner. He never saw him again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why and I can't analyze it, but I know I blew it," he says. "I 
almost knew then that I was doing something I'd regret and I did regret it." He 
pauses. "I didn't know it then, but I was depressed. I felt badly that I threw 
away something really worthwhile. But I felt like I just couldn't talk about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 So why not look his old friend up and start all over? 
</P>
<P>
 "I still feel embarrassed about the whole thing," he says. "I still feel down 
on myself about it." 
</P>
<P>
 He laughs.

 Advice for the friend-lorn: 
</P>
<P>
 * Remember that it's natural to feel sad, angry or guilty when you lose an 
important relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 * Give yourself permission and time to grieve. 
</P>
<P>
 * Give yourself credit for having cared enough about your friend to mourn the 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 * Talk about your feelings. If talking to other friends doesn't help, seek 
professional counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 * Know that as painful as it may feel now, time will help. 
</P>
<P>
 * When the pain subsides, keep yourself open and willing to make new friends 
and cherish the ones you already have. 
</P>
<P>
 * Remember that it's rarely too late to forgive or ask for forgiveness.

FIRST PERSON: COMMITMENTS; THE 'UHHS' AND 'MURRS' OF EVERYDAY PILLOW TALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN ALCORN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everybody's talking about talking. 
</P>
<P>
 There are books about how men and women communicate at work, how we 
communicate in relationships, even how we communicate during sex. (On this 
last, I'd like to stick with "thumbs up, thumbs down," but I digress.) 
</P>
<P>
 Amazingly, no one has written anything about how couples communicate 
unconsciously. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't mean sub consciously, I mean un consciously -- as in sound asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 My girlfriend and I have lived together for almost two years. We're both 
typical overworked, overbooked, careering urbanites, yet we manage to spend 
about 11 hours a day together. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, during about 9 1/2 of those 11 hours, one or both of us is 
sleeping, trying to get to sleep or trying to wake up. 
</P>
<P>
 We either had to learn to communicate in our sleep or spend all our waking 
hours managing the mundane affairs of the household, leaving no time at all to 
debate the important issues of the day. ("What do you want for dinner?" "I 
don't care. Whatever you want." "Why is it always up to me?" Et cetera.) 
</P>
<P>
 For example, every night, we have this call-and-response, where the one of us 
who is already asleep interviews the one who is just coming to bed. The entire 
interview is conducted in sleep language. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jock door?" the sleeping one asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, the back door is locked." 
</P>
<P>
 "Dogzin?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, dear, I brought the dog in." 
</P>
<P>
 "DP?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if he did or not. It's dark outside." 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, the conversation goes something like this: 
</P>
<P>
 "Tie zit?" 
</P>
<P>
 "About 8." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ga gup." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, it's time for you to get up." 
</P>
<P>
 "DP?" 
</P>
<P>
 "In the dining room." 
</P>
<P>
 The longer you are together, the more sophisticated your sleep vocabulary 
becomes. 
</P>
<P>
 My girlfriend likes to read in bed, but if she reads for too long, she'll get 
a grumpy "Turn on th' light" from somewhere under my pillow. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, this may sound like I'm saying, "Turn on the light." But what I'm 
actually saying is, "Turn off the light." 
</P>
<P>
 You see, saying the word off would require a major exhalation of breath, which 
a nodding-off person isn't capable of performing without waking up completely. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, since the light is already on, I trust my partner will understand 
that I'm asking her to turn it off. Really, in a good relationship, the only 
word that has to be somewhat intelligible is light.  
</P>
<P>
 Some of our sleep language isn't intelligible at all, just mutually 
agreed-upon, representational sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Murr" is our agreed-upon sound for "I love you," while "Uhh" can either mean 
"I love you too," or "I heartily concur," depending on the context. 
</P>
<P>
 We're getting pretty good at this. Soon, I expect we will be able to plan our 
vacations, revise our budget and name our children without either of us 
actually having to wake up. 
</P>
<P>
 I doubt, however, if we'll ever get as good as my parents. They came to stay 
with us a few weeks ago, and I marveled at their vast lexicon, the subtle 
nuances of their sleep-grunts, slurs and murmurs. After 30 years of marriage, 
my parents can have entire, witty conversations in their sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Dad, napping on the couch: "Murnah gon get a serr onnet?" ("Do you realize we 
are the only couple we know that isn't on the Internet?") 
</P>
<P>
 Mom, dozing on the other couch: "Svurr ga norg murf attack." ("We'll have to 
trade in our eight-track.") 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, of course, even sleep communication can break down. 
</P>
<P>
 The other night I told my girlfriend, "Dan dog dome ga morn," by which I 
meant, "If that damn dog doesn't stop messing in the house, I'm going to get 
him a catheter and hang it out the window." 
</P>
<P>
 She replied: "Murr." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, there was nothing for me to say except: "Uhh."

 A very proper woman inherited a parrot, Penrod, from her father's estate. The 
problem was that Penrod used vulgar language. After several embarrassing 
experiences when she hosted her bridge club, the woman told her minister about 
the problem. The minister said his female parrot "is a saint. She sits on her 
perch and prays all day long. Bring your parrot over. She'll be a good 
influence on him." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman took Penrod to the minister's house, and when the cages were placed 
together, Penrod hopped through the open doors and said, "Hi baby! How about a 
little lovin'?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Hallelujah!" sang the female parrot. "You're just what I've been praying 
for."

 Reader Margaret Lubliner of Canoga Park decided to teach her son Max, 3, about 
keeping away from strangers, so she checked out a library book. Max had all 
correct answers ("Say NO and run away.") until the question, "What if a 
stranger wanted to give you money or presents?" Max answered "Please." Mom 
decided to start at the beginning. Max was again perfect until, "What would you 
say if a stranger asked if he could take your picture?" 
</P>
<P>
 Max excitedly struck a pose and said, "Cheese!"  
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, I checked the book out for another week.

CAN THIS MARRIAGE BE SAVED: COMMITMENTS; POWERLESS TO STAND UP TO HIS PUT-DOWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By By the editors of Ladies' Home Journal 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "This past year has been awful," says Susan, 23, a stunning blond whose eyes 
are shadowed from lack of sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Her marriage two years ago to Christopher, a wealthy Englishman 20 years her 
senior, seemed like a dream come true. But his constant criticism is making her 
ill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Christopher accuses me of spending so much time with our son, Jason, that 
there's no time left for him. He says that I'm a terrible cook and that the 
house is a mess. I can never please him." 
</P>
<P>
 When her husband gets going, there is no stopping the harangues, Susan says, 
and she feels powerless to defend herself. Recently, she's been having panic 
attacks: "I was walking down the street last week and I felt my throat 
tightening. I couldn't swallow and I started gasping for breath. Thank God, a 
neighbor saw me and helped me home." 
</P>
<P>
 But Christopher, a no-nonsense business executive, has no idea why his wife is 
so unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I work very hard," he says brusquely, "and frankly I do not believe Susan is 
paying enough attention to me or the marriage." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When he comes home, he says, he wants a home-cooked meal, "and I do not 
consider greasy barbecued chicken from the deli a decent meal." He also insists 
that Susan has no respect for things that are important to him. "I'm paying a 
fortune to renovate our home, and she lets Jason spill apple juice on the 
Aubusson rug," he says with disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 Convinced that his wife, not he, needs help, Christopher dismisses any 
implication that his behavior or attitudes are contributing to the marriage 
woes. "These medical problems are all in her head," he announces. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most likely Susan's medical problems are psychosomatic in origin, but that 
doesn't mean they are not real," says Evelyn Moschetta, a marriage counselor in 
New York City and Huntington, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 "Susan is so upset by Christopher's constant criticism and lack of respect and 
support that she literally cannot swallow what is happening in her marriage." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question that Christopher must take some responsibility for the 
problems in this relationship. But whether or not he does, Susan must learn to 
stand up to the barrage of verbal assaults. If she continues to deny her 
feelings and submerge her anger, her self-esteem and her marriage will be 
damaged beyond repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Many husbands and wives feel unfairly criticized by their spouses, yet find 
themselves powerless to stand up to put-downs. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have a similar problem, these steps can help you rebuild your 
self-esteem and regain your footing: 
</P>
<P>
 * Remind yourself that you are entitled to your feelings and have every right 
to speak up: "I feel offended by what you just said," or "That was 
inconsiderate." If the insulting behavior continues, try to control yourself 
and not lash out wildly in defense. Instead, walk away. You'll be sending a far 
more powerful message. 
</P>
<P>
 * Choose your words with care to avoid fanning the flames. Speak firmly, but 
in a way that doesn't demean your partner: Stick to what therapists call the 
"When you . . . I feel" model. For instance, Susan can say, "When you criticize 
my cooking, I feel you're not paying attention to what's really important in a 
marriage. I love you, but I cannot cook a gourmet meal every night." 
</P>
<P>
 * Try not to respond to criticism by hurling criticism of your own. This only 
escalates the argument and deepens the power struggle. If you think you can't 
respond reasonably, say so: "I'm too angry to talk about this right now. After 
I've had a chance to calm down, we'll continue." 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask yourself if there might be even a shred of truth in what your partner is 
saying. If there is, can you negotiate a compromise? Susan can make the living 
room, with its expensive furnishings, off limits to their toddler. On the other 
hand, if having a home-cooked meal is so important to Christopher, perhaps he 
can share the responsibilities, with Susan doing the shopping and Christopher 
helping with the cooking when he gets home.

RSVP; AN EVENING OF ALL THINGS ASIAN

 On Saturday evening, for once, the elaborate gilding and murals in the 
Biltmore's Crystal room didn't outshine the crowd. Many of the women and 
several of the men attending the Festival of the Autumn Moon benefit for the 
Pacific Asia Museum were bedecked in Oriental splendor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only get to wear this about three hours a year," said Everett Palmer as he 
pointed out the five-clawed dragon woven amid the silver and gold threads of 
his Chinese robe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really shouldn't be worn at all. It's too good," added Palmer, whose wife 
Peg is one of the museum's founders. "We assume this must have been given to 
the missionary by someone pretty important," he said, explaining that he had 
bought the garment from a missionary family. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally eye-catching was Peter Adams, whose wife Elaine was event chairwoman. 
His shaggy red Tibetan hat, earrings from Afghanistan, coat from Thailand and 
Indian shoes were all bought on his travels. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction to the art treasures in the silent and fine art auctions was 
enthusiastic. "You're getting this really cheap," said the museum's Executive 
Director David Kamansky to urge on the bidders. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the direction of Lisa Hubbard, who had flown in from Sotheby's Hong Kong 
branch for the occasion, several items went for more than estimated. $1,800 was 
bid for a Burmese bronze Buddha and $4,200 for a Cartier-carved emerald 
pendant. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in general, the fund-raising evening provided an opportunity for guests 
to add to their collections at bargain prices while benefiting the museum's 
education and outreach programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Festival sponsor Richard Kelton added to his trove of Canton blue and white 
export ware with the purchase of a bowl and tray, circa 1840. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelton -- whose hobby is to sail parties of anthropologists and scientists to 
remote islands on his yacht -- first became involved with the museum through 
his interest in the journeys of South Seas explorer Captain James Cook. 
</P>
<P>
 "I attended a good high school," said Kelton, "but I only remember one course 
about Asian history. Sadly, we don't learn much about China, Japan or the 
cultures of Pacific Asia here. That's why I feel the museum's outreach programs 
to the schools are so important." 
</P>
<P>
 The exotic menu included Oriental-style smoked salmon salad, duck and a sweet 
cream custard wih guava sauce. Guests took home the table favors, moon cakes 
from the Kien Giang Bakery in blue and white china bowls.

INTO THE NIGHT: RSVP; PARTYING WITH THE GREATEST OF EASE

 The Scene: Cirque du Soleil's opening night on Thursday. The otherworldly 
performance under the big top at the Santa Monica Pier was followed by a party 
at the new Bergamot Station, a complex of galleries housed in old warehouse 
space that, by tricks of the lighting and carnival elan, was transformed into a 
moody fantasia for a celebration that didn't wind down until 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Johnny Carson, Jodie Foster, Jack Palance, Peter Guber, Jeffrey 
Katzenberg, Gene Hackman, Cindy Williams, Anne Archer and Linda Gray were among 
celebs who attended the performance. Marlee Matlin and Ed Begley Jr. also made 
it to the party, where the Mongolian contortionist team Ulziibayar Chimed, 10, 
and Nomin Tseveendorj, 9, changed from their gleaming costumes into jeans and 
tore up the dance floor like any young Westside girls. 
</P>
<P>
 The Language of Love: Mongolian, Russian, French and American performers 
mingled easily. The Cirque Strong Man, Rick ZumWalt, an American from Missouri, 
greeted Belgian actor Christian Racoux with wordless familiarity. "We 
communicate with laughter and gesture," ZumWalt said. Laughter and gesture was 
how hearing-impaired actress Marlee Matlin held forth with Russian clown 
Serguei Chachelev, who is deaf and just learning English signing. "I've been 
coming since 1987," Matlin signed. "You don't need words to enjoy the circus." 
</P>
<P>
 Fabio Who? Mikhail Matorin does a high-wire solo dance with a huge metallic 
cube that transcends geometry as well as the imagination. He's the real thing. 
"I went to the circus school when I was 10," he said. "In 1990, I saw the 
Cirque du Soleil. I developed the act with my father, who is the director of 
the Moscow Circus." 
</P>
<P>
 Chow: Wave upon wave of fresh-shucked shellfish cascaded down a long oyster 
bar. Trays of sushi, barbecued ribs, quesadillas and other assorted delectables 
were prepared by Food Inc. (It's a thinking caterer who makes sure the line to 
the ladies room gets served.) 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment: Dance music came from Man Go Bang. Meanwhile, self-described 
"performance painter" Norton Wisdom, a former lifeguard, worked away, attacking 
his canvas with a window-washing squeegee. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: The problem with a circus, according to KCRW DJ Tom Schnabel -- "When 
you see clowns now, you don't think of Beckett, you think of homeless people in 
Santa Monica."

LET US NOW PRAISE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN; HIGH MARKS, TO DATE, FOR U.S. MILITARY 
IN HAITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Troop transports overshoot the airport or land on the wrong island. Dozens of 
American soldiers are caught in an ambush and sent home in body bags. An 
American platoon, overheated from all the tension of being on the uncertain 
ground of a foreign land, inadvertently wipes out a small village and creates 
an instant anti-American cause celebre . 
</P>
<P>
 These are the scenes of horror that dog America whenever foreign intervention 
is proposed. These are the visions that keep U.S. military planners awake at 
night as they contemplate the risky mission that has been assigned them. 
</P>
<P>
 And, indeed, if any one of these nightmare scenarios had occurred in Haiti, 
can't you just imagine the headlines? And all the second guessing (and, yes, 
all the critical newspaper editorials)? But none of this has happened in Haiti. 
Not yet, anyway; and maybe (just maybe) never. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us all hope for the best. And -- in optimistic anticipation of the pivotal 
and perhaps decisive moment when Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras steps down (which 
diplomatic sources said would occur today) -- let us now praise brave men and 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us honor the tremendous courage of the U.S. Special Forces who, up in the 
north of Haiti, have rather quietly but firmly established a measure of order. 
And let us also note that U.S. Special Forces have been backed at times by a 
platoon of Army Rangers -- a joint operation that's yet another example of the 
growing cooperation and integration of all parts of our armed forces, under the 
modern military philosophy initiated by former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff Colin Powell and carried forward by his successor, Gen. John 
Shalikashvili. 
</P>
<P>
 And let us praise the bravery of the U.S. Marines who early on avoided an 
ambush, stood up to the Haitian policemen in Cap Haitien and, in that one 
tragically bloody but apparently seminal operation, not only dodged the bullet 
that no doubt would have traumatized U.S. domestic opinion but also laid down 
the line that American troops would be every bit as tough as they had to be. 
</P>
<P>
 And let us praise the unsung American military geniuses who, back at the bases 
in America, school, train and prepare our troops to brave the dangers of the 
front line. As Colin Powell used to say so often during the Gulf War, has there 
ever been a better prepared, equipped and trained army in the history of the 
world? So let us give our military tremendous credit for that. 
</P>
<P>
 Let all of us also give credit where credit is due, and that is to the 
commander of the operation in Haiti: Gen. Hugh Shelton. Did the Los Angeles 
Times (or many other U.S. papers) editorially support this invasion? Absolutely 
not. Did the American military welcome the opportunity? Not a whole lot, 
according to all the reporting. But when the President gave the word, the 
military was ready. They had done the planning, the forces had received the 
training, the operation went off like a dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Not one American soldier has been killed under fire. Of course, that could all 
change in a second. Potential disaster lies behind every hill, tree, village. 
Disaster also lies in the ever-present potential for casualties by friendly 
fire. And disaster lies in the very nature of the mission: For the American 
forces are not equipped or trained to reconstruct a failed nation. They are 
designed to defend, attack, repel -- and that's a whole different deal. But 
there they are now in Haiti, coping as best they can. And doing it remarkably, 
almost unbelievably well, at least so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us now praise our brave men and women. And be very thankful indeed.

190 AND 191: 'YES' ON JUDICIAL REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two measures on the Nov. 8 ballot would bring needed reform to the state's 
judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 190 would reform the state's Commission on Judicial Performance. 
California led the nation when it created the first judicial discipline system 
in 1960, but more than 30 years later that process is demonstrably clubby, 
secretive and ineffective at disciplining errant or incompetent judges. This 
measure would increase the size of the commission and change its composition so 
that representatives from the public become a majority. Just as important, 190 
provides for open disciplinary proceedings and gives the reconstituted 
commission the authority to remove or discipline judges and former judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Presently, the commission can decide whether to hold a public hearing on 
misconduct charges -- and it almost never decides to do so -- and the 
commission can only make a recommendation regarding its findings to the state 
Supreme Court, which actually takes action. Proposition 190 would give the 
commission the authority to act on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 191 would eliminate California's justice courts and merge them 
with the municipal courts. The state Constitution sets up justice courts 
instead of municipal courts in judicial districts with populations of 40,000 or 
less. When California was less populous, the number of justice and municipal 
courts was comparable. Now, however, only 37 justice courts, with 37 justices, 
remain. That compares to 92 municipal courts with more than 600 judges. 
Moreover, although justice and municipal courts once had separate 
responsibilities, for many years their areas of responsibility have been 
identical. Both courts hear misdemeanors and infractions and most civil 
lawsuits involving disputes of $25,000 or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Retaining these two separate but parallel court systems no longer makes sense. 
Under this measure all justice courts would become municipal courts, effective 
next Jan. 1. The number, qualifications and pay of justice court judges and 
employees would be unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Propositions 190 and 191 are needed. We urge a "yes" on each.

LIBEL IN REVIEWS: THE BOOK IS STILL OPEN; SUPREME COURT DECISION AFFIRMS FIRST 
AMENDMENT RIGHTS, BUT CLARIFICATION IS NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The free expression of opinion is democracy's oxygen. Choke it off and 
democracy begins to die. That's why we applaud the U.S. Supreme Court decision 
last week to let stand an appeals court opinion in favor of the New York Times 
and against author Dan E. Moldea, who had filed a lawsuit claiming he was 
libeled in a 1989 review of his book on football, "Interference." We hope all 
forms of opinion will be more secure because of this decision in a case of 
literary opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 For years in American jurisprudence it has been understood that the expression 
of opinion enjoys a greater immunity from charges of libel than does the 
reporting of fact. But greater immunity does not equal total immunity, as the 
court made clear in a much-noticed 1990 decision (Milkovich vs. Lorain Journal 
Co.). To give an example: If John Jones is in fact not a liar, the first three 
words in the sentence "In my opinion John Jones is a liar" do not guarantee 
immunity from libel charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Moldea's claim was that errors made by the reviewer amounted to libel against 
the author. In fact, the review did contain some errors; Moldea did have some 
valid points. The Court of Appeals first ruled that the errors in the review 
could constitute libel. But then, months later, the court, to general 
amazement, reversed its decision, stating that it had "failed to take 
sufficient account of the fact that the statements at issue appeared in the 
context of a book review, a genre in which readers expect to find spirited 
critiques of literary works . . . that are capable of a number of rational 
interpretations." 
</P>
<P>
 Note that Moldea II, as the Appeals Court termed its reversal, said virtually 
nothing about context other than that the article was a book review. But Moldea 
I had stated that genre alone could not determine whether a statement was 
libelous, and Moldea II confirmed this principle. 
</P>
<P>
 In declining to review the latter decision, the Supreme Court may have had in 
mind one of the other considerations of context advanced by the New York Times. 
Arguing against the Court of Appeals' initial decision for Moldea, the 
newspaper said: "The decision utterly fails to recognize the difference between 
a subjective evaluation of a writer's work and a direct, defamatory statement 
about the writer himself. The consequences for book reviews can hardly be 
overstated. Literary -- or law -- reviews that find books -- or a brief -- to 
be 'badly reasoned,' or 'written poorly,' become as actionable as a review that 
states 'the author's alcoholism has clearly affected his work.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Was this distinction raised by the New York Times the one that persuaded the 
high court, or was it something else? At this point, we do not know. The Moldea 
case was settled without that point having been nailed down. So perhaps free 
speech might be more honorably and effectively defended if we had a better case 
to guide us. Claiming our First Amendment freedom to criticize legal briefs and 
court decisions, we suggest that the complex matter of responsibility to fact 
even within the expression of opinion deserves further attention.

CATCHING TAGGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About a month ago, driving home from Downtown, I noticed seven teen-agers 
clustered near an apartment building where one boy was tagging, painting with a 
spray can, the front of the building. The area had other graffiti and I was 
surprised to see this going on in broad daylight. 
</P>
<P>
 I quickly circled the block looking for a police car or a public phone. 
Finding a phone (and refusing to call 911 as this shouldn't interfere with a 
crisis) I called a police station given by 411, was put on hold 20 minutes, 
then disconnected. I called again, finally spoke to an officer and was told I 
was calling the wrong district. Put on hold again at the new number for 10 
minutes, I hung up, circled the block and tried again to find a police car. The 
boy was tagging another building. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, I found a police car at a local 7-Eleven store. The officers inside 
the store listened to what I told them was going on just three blocks away. "Is 
it your property?" I was asked. "No." "Well," the officer explained, "if it's 
not your property, then why are you bothering with this?" Also, "there's no way 
to arrest them unless we get a complaint from the owner." Did I know the owner? 
I asked if they would apprehend the youths if they saw the tagging themselves. 
"Probably." I described in detail what the tagger wore, told them the exact 
street corner, described his group of friends, and added that his right hand 
may have some black paint from the spray can. 
</P>
<P>
 I did all the right things -- didn't confront the tagger on my own, contacted 
a cop. I drove again to the area where the youths were, five minutes later, 
still there, and no police car was in sight. I hope the officers enjoyed their 
coffee and cake. 
</P>

 How do we stop the taggers? Something must be done to stop the writing on the 
walls. I've watched this happen several times in my own neighborhood, but by 
the time you go to report the tagging, the taggers are long gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the neighborhoods should get together and form a "tagger watch" group 
along with the Neighborhood Watch. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard trying to catch someone that can use a can of spray paint to write a 
paragraph or draw a mural on a wall in 20 seconds or less. My brother-in-law 
was shot in the back trying to protect his neighbor's wall from taggers. 
</P>
<P>
 How much longer must we live like this? How much longer must this go on?

 First I cried, second I got angry and third I did something. 
</P>
<P>
 I cried because my wife died of breast cancer, I got angry because of her 
treatment options -- surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, or to quote Dr. Susan 
Love, "slash, burn and poison."I did something by joining a group of remarkable 
women, the Los Angeles Breast Cancer Alliance. These women are dedicated to the 
eradication of this scourge. 
</P>
<P>
 It is ironic that the headline on an editorial (Oct. 5) was "Living Legacy," 
which was the theme of the "2nd Annual War Mammorial Exhibit" held at the 
Federal Building Oct. 1-2. It was a moving, exhilarating experience to join 
together with caring individuals that are committed to ending this epidemic. 
</P>

 Anyone who has been touched by this disease should know that it affects the 
whole family. And no one should look upon this as a women's issue.

SIMPSON JURY, 'MEDIA POLLUTION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With regard to the questionnaire that the Simpson case jurors have to fill out 
before they are selected (Oct. 1), I would think the prosecution and defense 
would be so grateful to have jurors that they would go out of their way to be 
kind and gracious to them and thank them for giving up their time and families 
for the length of time it will be to have this trial.  
</P>
<P>
 If I were presented such a questionnaire to fill out, I would tell them what 
they could do with their questionnaire and go back home to my family. For $5 a 
day I can think of a better way to spend my time than to try and give this 
pompous, conceited and overrated celebrity and his attorneys a fair trial.  
</P>
<P>
 If this were anyone else, this wouldn't be happening. This is where our 
justice system is wrong. It is not fairness and justice for all, just those 
that can afford it. It all comes down to one word -- G-R-E-E-D!

<P>
 Judging from the Simpson case, jury selection has become an obscene process, 
violating the rights and dignity of the jurors and manipulating judicial 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Juries should be selected at random from a pool of multiethnic jurors that can 
serve for the needed length of time. Neither the attorneys nor the defendants 
should know their identities. Neither attorneys nor defendants should be 
allowed eye contact with the jurors (a one-way mirror would suffice). 
Questionnaires or psychological tests that are intended to predict the outcome 
of a trial should not be allowed. Juries should also have access to their own 
consultants to help them sort out courtroom theatrics from pertinent facts.

 The Simpson saga will probably drag on for months or longer and the taxpayer 
expenses will continue to accrue without limit. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a plan to complete the trial in a few days or less. As soon as the jury 
selection is complete, take the salaries and fees of the lawyers and their 
staffs for one week and divide them evenly among the jurors. Take the daily 
stipends and mileage allowances of the jury and divide them evenly among the 
lawyers and their staffs. The trial will be finished in a week.

 Re "Coroner's Office a Prime Target of Simpson Defense," Oct. 2: 
</P>
<P>
 You note that the Simpson defense strategy is to attack everyone who collected 
and handled evidence, as well as the prosecution attorneys and the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Why can't the media just say no? Simpson attorneys have no right to probe the 
private lives of cops, coroners and prosecutors. Why does The Times continue to 
"play along" on the ruse of reporting the news? I don't want to read about it, 
and I'll bet there are others who feel the same. Leave the dirt for the 
National Enquirer.

 After enduring months of this inane media circus called "the O.J. Simpson

 I share Brian Stonehill's concern (" 'Information Pollution' Is Real," 
Commentary, Oct. 2) that the proliferation of mass media is just as likely to 
muddle public discourse as it is to illuminate it. And it's tempting to link 
this concern with powerful environmental metaphors. To call the hysterical 
speculation surrounding the Simpson trial "media pollution" satisfies some deep 
urge in many of us to clean up our collective act, to get the Oprahs and 
Limbaughs to just shut up so that a little sanity might reign in the courtroom 
and in the public sphere. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm equally troubled, though, by the "media ecology movement" Stonehill 
espouses. It's based, as he admits, on a scientific metaphor: Information can 
be just as toxic as chemicals or nuclear waste. But while the toxicity of a 
chemical on the environment is a measurable matter of fact, the toxicity of a 
piece of information abides wholly in the realm of values. An example Stonehill 
brings up makes the point. For him, the postage stamp of (blues legend) Robert 
Johnson with his cigarette airbrushed out is a good thing: It supposedly 
demonstrates our willingness to get rid of "toxic imagery" that might influence 
young people. But to me, the act of airbrushing itself is even more toxic. It's 
tantamount to a willful distortion of history that in the end only contributes 
to the debasement of discourse. 
</P>
<P>
 And who decides what gets airbrushed, and what doesn't, anyway?

OAKWOOD GANG TRUCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After reading "A Tenuous Truce" (Sept. 27), it dawned on me that the gangs are 
being portrayed here as the "victims." 
</P>
<P>
 As a long-term resident of Oakwood I have learned long ago the only way to 
survive is to keep quiet.As I arrive home from work every evening I find myself 
being recognized by the familiar faces of neighbors who know that I know 
exactly what they are doing day after day on those same street corners. It 
doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what you have to do to keep the 
peace -- you keep your mouth shut. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel that the real victims in the gang war have truly been forgotten. The 
area is back to business as usual. Once again it's the open drug supermarket it 
was before the "gang war" began. If anyone doesn't believe what the real 
motivation behind the gang truce is, speak to the folks cruising our streets, 
now safely purchasing their goods.

JUDGES AREN'T SEQUESTERED; WHY JURIES?; SIMPSON CASE: IF WE CAN TRUST 12 PEOPLE 
TO DECIDE LIFE AND LIBERTY, WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TRUST THEM NOT TO WATCH TV. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERWIN CHEMERINSKY, Erwin Chemerinsky is a law professor at the University of 
Southern California. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the hardest decisions that Judge Lance Ito will make in the O.J. 
Simpson case is whether to sequester the jury during the entire trial. 
California law leaves the decision up to the trial judge. Ito could sequester 
the jury only during the time of their deliberations or from the beginning of 
the trial. Although limited sequestration poses some risks, it would be fairer 
to the jurors and to the parties in this highly publicized murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest argument against complete sequestration is the enormous burden 
on the jurors. Total sequestration removes jurors for months from families and 
friends. Even without sequestration, jury service in a long trial generally 
imposes a great hardship. But taking people away from their homes for months is 
a huge additional imposition and only should be ordered if it is truly 
essential to ensuring a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, however, sequestration decreases the fairness of the court 
proceedings. Total sequestration dramatically decreases the number of jurors 
who can serve. There are many, such as those with children or the 
responsibility for caring for parents, who could participate if sequestered 
only for a short time, during deliberations, but could not if it was for the 
entire trial. The more the jury pool is constricted, the less likely it is that 
the jury will reflect a cross-section of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, sequestration could adversely affect the jury's deliberations. Eager 
to return home after months away, a sequestered jury is more likely to hurry 
its decision-making. If serious differences of opinion develop, the jury is 
less likely to persist in trying to reach a verdict and avoid a mistrial. 
Reports from past cases with fully sequestered juries reveal that the constant 
contact with only one another increases the likelihood that friction will 
develop among the jurors, which might impede effective deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 Weighed against these harms, the greatest risk to not fully sequestering the 
jury is that jurors might be contaminated by news media reports, true or false, 
of evidence not admitted at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a trivial concern in light of the unprecedented degree of media 
attention and leaked information in the Simpson case. Yet it is important to 
remember that even though it is the defendant who is most at risk of harm from 
leaks of inadmissible evidence, Simpson's attorneys strongly oppose full 
sequestration. 
</P>
<P>
 There is every reason to believe that the jurors will carefully comply with 
the judge's clear order that they not read, listen to or watch any reports 
about the case. Also, in light of the publicity thus far, the jury will need to 
be instructed to disregard everything they heard before the trial. The 
possibility of exposure to additional media stories does not justify the great 
burden imposed by total sequestration. 
</P>
<P>
 Full sequestration shows disrespect for those who are making a large sacrifice 
by serving as jurors. No one ever suggests that judges be sequestered, even in 
cases that they decide without a jury. Total sequestration assumes that jurors 
will not comply with the judge's order, and, more important, assumes that the 
jurors cannot exclude external influences and decide solely based on the 
evidence in the courtroom. The very existence of the jury system is based on 
faith in the 12 people who will decide O.J. Simpson's fate. They should be 
trusted to act and decide responsibly without the huge imposition of total 
sequestration.

PERSPECTIVES ON PROPOSITION 186; SPARE THESE 'DINOSAURS' AN UNTIMELY DEATH; THE 
FAMILY DOCTOR IS ALREADY UNDER SIEGE FROM INSURANCE-INDUSTRY BUREAUCRATS; WHO 
WOULD YOU CALL IN A STATE PLAN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN H. KIRSCHNER, Melvin H. Kirschner, a family-practice physician in Van 
Nuys, co-chairs the Los Angeles County Medical Assn./Bar Assn. Joint Committee 
on Biomedical Ethics. These opinions are his own. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's an expression sometimes used in health care for a doctor who cares 
enough about patients to be accessible, to listen to their needs and ease the 
pathway to care by other trustworthy care-givers when they cannot provide it 
themselves, to be honest and always work in the patient's best interests. When 
a crisis arises, the doctor is available for the patient. 
</P>
<P>
 These doctors are "dinosaurs." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the expression also can apply to specialists and nurses, it usually 
refers to old-fashioned family doctors who, in the view of most people in this 
country, are becoming extinct. 
</P>
<P>
 What caused this? The health-insurance industry. In the name of cost control, 
the insurance industry has taken decision-making and choice away from the 
care-giver and the patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurers will protest that this isn't true; that decisions are still in the 
hands of patients. Just ask the teachers of the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, who were wrenched out of the care of their family doctors and 
assigned to primary-physician "gatekeepers."  
</P>
<P>
 The gatekeeper is responsible for doing as much as possible in the primary 
setting. When something cannot be done at the primary clinic, the gatekeeper is 
expected to produce a prolific stream of paperwork documenting the need for 
specialty care. 
</P>
<P>
 This paperwork is reviewed by a utilization-review doctor, nurse or sometimes 
a clerk following a set of preordained guidelines. This is known as "managed 
care." If a gatekeeper is frugal in the use of costly specialists and services, 
there may be a reward at the end of the year in the form of a share of the 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was a tendency to overutilize in the fee-for-service arena, there 
certainly is the risk of underutilization in the managed-care arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, health insurers' profits and executive salaries have become 
obscene. And much of the health-insurance dollar is being spent on advertising 
in pursuit of "market share." This has resulted in an administrative overhead 
of up to 50 cents of the health-premium dollar before one cent is spent on 
medical services and products. 
</P>
<P>
 A "single payer" proposal will be on the November ballot: Proposition 186, the 
California Health Security Act. It will provide universal access to medical 
care and roll all services into one program. There will be no separate Medi-Cal 
or Medicare, but there will be increased coverage, such as for medicines and 
long-term care. Medical treatment for injury on the job, in a car accident or 
on someone's property will all be covered. Thus the need for most medical or 
health insurance will be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 The administrative overhead of the California Health Security Act is capped at 
4% instead of the insurers' 25% to 40%-plus. But the biggest incentive for many 
people will be the return to real choice -- choice of doctor, hospital, 
specialist and even alternative care. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision-making will be returned to the patients and their doctors. And 
the doctors whose patients were taken away by restrictive insurance programs, 
who weren't allowed access to managed-care groups, who wanted to refer their 
patients to specialists they knew and trusted will again be able to do what 
they always did best -- care for patients. The dinosaurs will return.

ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH / A SPECIAL REPORT: COLLEGE LIFE 
</P>

 FAMILY LINES: Orange Coast College runs in the Peterson family. In 1947, Basil 
H. Peterson founded the school on a vacant plot and became its first president. 
His son, Richard B. Peterson, played on the OCC basketball team four years 
later. Now, grandson Alan Peterson has made it a point to enroll at OCC. "I 
didn't get a chance to know my grandfather well when I was young, but as I've 
gotten older, I've become interested in his life," says Peterson, 22, who plans 
to transfer to Brigham Young University in January. 
</P>
<P>
 HERE AND NOW: At Cal State Fullerton, four students have started a chapter of 
NOW, the National Organization for Women. Men are welcome, too. Just ask the 
president, Mr. Bil Corry, a women's studies minor. Corry, 25, says more men 
should learn about women: "It can only improve your life when you consider half 
the people you deal with are of the other gender." 
</P>
<P>
 HALL CRAWL: Student activism over the years has varied from anti-war movements 
to protests over fee hikes. At Chapman University, a group called Artemis has 
formed to advocate animal rights. But Artemis founder Sara McCann, above, says 
the group has aroused suspicions. . . . After Chapman's most-prized turtle 
vanished from the science department, campus officials questioned McCann; she 
was cleared when it was found wandering in a lab. "Now," says McCann, 20, a 
history major, "my friends are all buying me little turtle miniatures." 
</P>
<P>
 COMPU-JOBS: A new program at various Orange County community colleges helps 
students with the business of job hunting by linking them electronically to the 
job market. Accounting students, for example, can have their job skills typed 
into a computer which then lists county companies with related job openings, 
says Darlene Jensen, supervisor of job placement at Fullerton College. . . . 
The system includes information on wages, job requirements and which careers 
are hot. Says Jensen: "We want to help students look beyond just getting a job 
now, and look at building a career."

<P>
 A suspected paramilitary group member drove a truck into a pro-democracy 
demonstration in a town west of the Haitian capital Sunday, killing at least 14 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Journalists at the scene in the town of Miragoane said witnesses identified 
the driver as a member of the Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti 
(FRAPH), the country's most feared paramilitary group. The witnesses said he 
deliberately drove his vehicle into the rally and sped away. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second incident in three days involving a vehicle plowing into 
supporters of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. On Friday, a bus drove 
into a demonstration in St.-Marc, killing at least four people.

POLICE IN LONDON BATTLE FOES OF NEW LAW-AND-ORDER BILL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police battled opponents of a new law-and-order bill in central London on 
Sunday after what organizers said was Britain's biggest civil rights march. 
</P>
<P>
 Rioters hurled bottles and cans at police equipped with shields, helmets and 
clubs in exclusive Park Lane alongside Hyde Park, where the march ended.At 
least 16 were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said 100,000 people had turned out to call for scrapping the 
Criminal Justice Bill before it becomes law this month. Police said there were 
20,000 marchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill weakens a defendant's traditional right to silence and tightens the 
law to prevent squatting. 
</P>
<P>
 It also gives police new powers to deal with indigents and other dropouts who 
roam the countryside and are often in conflict with local people. Police will 
be able to break up groups of more than nine.

CLINTON STAGES PART II OF HIGH SCHOOL REUNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton put Iraq and Haiti on hold for a few hours Sunday to welcome 
his Arkansas high school classmates to the White House for a 30th reunion -- 
Part II. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, a member of the Hot Springs High School class of 1964, attended the 
formal July reunion in Arkansas and invited the gang back to Washington for a 
fall get-together. 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Walker, who helped organize the trip, said Clinton previously invited 
his class to the Arkansas governor's mansion after reunions for punch and 
cookies. Sunday's reception was an extension of that tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 200 of the 335 classmates made the trip with their spouses and 
children, forming a line of more than 500 people Sunday to get their pictures 
taken with the President and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The classmates paid their own way to Washington and reimbursed the White House 
for the cost of the reception, Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The party lasted about two hours, ending when Clinton rushed off to an Oval 
Office meeting with his advisers on Iraq's move toward Kuwait.

STREET SMART: THOSE ALMOST-U-TURNS TO SNAG A PARKING SPOT ARE LEGAL MOVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 The main downtown street of San Clemente, Avenida del Mar, is marked with a 
continuous double center line and has diagonal parking on both sides of the 
street. It has now reached epidemic proportions where motorists traveling one 
side of the street will suddenly make a turn across the double line to get that 
"perfect" diagonal parking spot on the opposite side of the street.  
</P>
<P>
 When I complained about this to the local police a few years ago, they claim 
that the practice was marginally legal, because the courts have held that such 
a turn is not a complete U-turn, thus not a violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Can you verify whether such a sweeping turn in mid-block of a business 
district, to end up in a diagonal parking space facing in the other direction, 
is legal? If it is not legal, how can the Sheriff's Department be made to 
enforce the law? I've nearly been run down by these inane turners on more than 
one occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Wally Roberts 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente 
</P>
<P>
 You heard right the first time you complained about this practice of turning 
mid-block. It is not considered a violation to swing into the opposite traffic 
lane to snag a parking space, according to the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department, which enforces the law in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 What happened to laws on noise pollution?  
</P>
<P>
 As I sat at a Laguna Beach cafe this Sunday, frequent motorcycles roared down 
Coast Highway, many goosing their engines mindlessly, shattering my nerves and 
peace. One cycle set off a car alarm that further contributed to the noise 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Several motorcycles had constricted ends to their tail pipes, ensuring that 
they would be extra loud and attract the attention they seem to require. I have 
never seen a Laguna Beach policeman stop any of these vehicles and have never 
heard of the Laguna Beach police citing any motorcyclist for making excessive 
noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Are there no regulations on the books, or do the Laguna Beach police just fail 
to enforce them?  
</P>
<P>
 James C. Daly 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Because Coast Highway is a state highway, it is under the jurisdiction of 
Caltrans, not the city of Laguna Beach. Law enforcement is handled by the 
California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans does have noise limit regulations for residential areas, but not for 
business areas, like the ribbon of Coast Highway that goes through Laguna 
Beach, said Rose Orem, a spokeswoman for Caltrans. It's simply a given that 
business areas will be noisy, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Madison, a spokesman for the Department of Motor Vehicles in Sacramento, 
says there are noise limit laws in the California Vehicle Code, but enforcement 
is casual at best. Officer Greg Manual, of the CHP in Sacramento, says if an 
officer hears a vehicle making excessive noise on a freeway or state highway, 
that vehicle may be cited. But he added that because noise pollution is not a 
primary collision factor, the CHP does not focus much energy on it.  
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I frequently return home to Anaheim from South County late at night and have 
been highly irritated at Caltrans on more than one occasion. You see, when they 
close a connector ramp (i.e. to the Garden Grove Freeway and the Santa Ana 
Freeway), or the entire freeway, they always seem to place the orange signs 
advising of upcoming closures too close to the actual spot.  
</P>
<P>
 The result is that a driver passes up any alternative routes over side streets 
and can get stuck on the freeway, either in a jam or ushered miles up the wrong 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 With the multibillion-dollar freeway construction on the Santa Ana Freeway and 
other freeways through the next century, surely Caltrans can afford a few more 
orange signs alerting motorists of upcoming roadblocks or detours. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Perry 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 A series of signs up to 3,000 feet in advance of any closed freeway, ramp or 
connector is required, Orem said. The exact location of these advance warning 
signs may vary because they cannot be posted in an area that poses a traffic 
hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, warning signs placed too far in advance of the closure lose their 
effectiveness. Drivers who don't encounter the closure in a relatively short 
distance may ignore the signs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans recommends you consult the closure listings provided by local 
newspapers (such as Freeway Forecast in The Times on Sundays) and tune into a 
traffic report when starting a trip. 
</P>

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; MIGHTY CLOUDS SING ROCK ( 'N' ROLL) OF AGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everyone knows that gospel music has had a heavy impact on popular music, 
particularly on the Motown sound and oth& B forms as well as the whole of rock 
'n' roll. But just in case that fact had been forgotten, the Mighty Clouds of 
Joy reinforced the lesson when they blew into Orange Coast College's Robert B. 
Moore Theatre on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The gospel-rock connection is a two-way street with the Mighty Clouds. Not 
only did the eight-piece group perform heaven-bent, soul-stirring spirituals 
and songs of devotion of the kind that has defined their work for more than 35 
years, they also included just enough numbers from the pop charts to provide an 
object lesson in the history of rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 One couldn't help hear the connection between the genres in the Clouds' 
opening two numbers. They came on stage to an upbeat, hand-clapping rendition 
of "Move On Up a Little Higher," written after the turn of the century by one 
of gospel's innovators, Herbert Brewster Sr. They followed it with a slow, 
stately version of "Love Train," the dance hit the O'Jays took to No. 1 on the 
R & B charts in 1973. Both the message of as aspiration and the underlying feel 
of the two selections, though done at different tempos, were strikingly 
consistent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The group also performed "You Are So Beautiful," the Joe Cocker hit, in 
soulful ballad style as well as Bette Midler's big seller "The Wind Beneath My 
Wings." It didn't take much imagination to see how each of these pop numbers 
fit into a program of gospel music as each has a devotional message that can be 
interpreted on both worldly and spiritual levels. 
</P>
<P>
 And just in case these examples didn't drive the point home, the group made 
humorous visual connections as lead vocalist Joe Ligon slid James Brown style 
across the stage and guitarist-musical director Dwight Gordon borrowed a page 
from Little Richard as he did the duck-strut in front of the band. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this was no rock concert. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the theater often took on the airs of a revivalist's tent as the 
Clouds brought members of the audience to their feet to clap, wave and testify 
with the band. Elmer Gantry couldn't have done it better. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the electricity was generated by Ligon, whose soaring, somewhat gruff 
tones, sprinkled with shouts, searing cries and deep-throated, wordless 
interludes, filled the hall on nearly every tune. By now, it's not news that 
Ligon, who's been credited with influencing everyone from Levi Stubbs of the 
Four Tops to the Godfather of Soul himself (Brown), has one of the most 
expansive vocal instruments around. What is amazing is that he is able to 
maintain such a strong, all-out sound for the duration of an evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Ligon gets good support from "high" tenor Wilbert Williams, who hit an 
incredible whistling falsetto note during "Love Train" and tenor Michael 
McCowan, whose voice stands in pure contrast to Ligon's more gravelly sounds. 
Harmonies, whether three- or four-part, were seamless throughout the evening, 
as baritone Richard Wallace added solid bottom-end vocals (he also doubled on 
bass guitar) and Gordon added his voice on select songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the accompaniment was less polished than the vocals -- drummer Johnny 
Valentine occasionally wandered astray over bridges -- the instrumental side of 
the clouds fits neatly into their formula, with organist Hampton Carlton adding 
sanctified touches and keyboardist Alphonso McClain working up blues and 
orchestral effects from his synthesizers. And when the band was called on to 
rock, it delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 But the group was most impressive during quiet numbers. Their a capella 
feature, "Working on the Building," sung quietly and just back from the 
microphones in four-part harmony, was the sweetest moment of the evening.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; DE LA SOUL: MUCH OF EXCITEMENT IS GONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 De La Soul arrived on the national scene five years ago with "3 Feet High and 
Rising," one of the most varied and playful rap albums ever produced. It fed 
omnivorously upon such varied -- even incongruous -- sources as '60s soul and 
'70s disco, and it went beyond the usual R & B foundations to craft rap songs 
out of materials borrowed from Steely Dan and psychedelic pop. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Island trio's next move was to ditch the loopy sweetness that 
prevailed on "3 Feet High" and reveal a pronounced bitter streak on its 
disillusioned, dyspeptic 1991 follow-up, "De La Soul Is Dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Going from sweet to sour at least signaled a willingness to go to extremes and 
avoid repetition. With its most recent album, "Buhloone Mindstate," which came 
out a year ago, De La Soul settled into an in-between state in which the 
group's previously inventive studio production turned ordinary and the rhyming 
grew routine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a 70-minute set Friday night at the Coach House, the three fancifully 
nicknamed band members -- rappers Posdnuos (Kelvin Mercer) and Trugoy the Dove 
(David Jolicoeur) and DJ Maseo (Vincent Mason Jr.) -- weren't able to generate 
anything special either. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, specialness often eludes live rappers, who have to leave their most 
alluring musical resource, an electronic collage of sounds, in the studio. De 
La Soul didn't augment its performance with supporting musicians, singers or 
dancers, choosing to play it the old-fashioned way, with all the beats and 
embellishments supplied by dual turntables. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the limitations of the format, De La Soul showed solid skills. Posdnuos 
(pronounced pos-di-noose) and Trugoy (that's "yogurt" spelled backward) don't 
have distinctive vocal hues or a knack for character-playing. But both voices 
came across clearly and their tandem work was as forceful and well-coordinated 
as Vince Lombardi's old Green Bay sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's pacing kept the energy flowing, except for a couple of needlessly 
long lulls when the rappers engaged the crowd in a name-that-rap-tune contest 
and invited audience members to come on stage and take a shot at impromptu, 
"freestyle" rhyme-slinging. Six answered the call with unremarkable results as 
the segment went on for about 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, De La Soul successfully answered the fundamental challenge of live 
rap, which is to keep the crowd on its feet and eager for any call-and-response 
hollering and shout-along refrains that might pop up. 
</P>
<P>
 While it met the basic requirements of sharp technique and maintaining a 
happily riled-up audience, De La Soul didn't make much of its time 
thematically. The trio left out its socially conscious raps, such as "Ghetto 
Than" and "Millie Pulled a Pistol on Santa" (about an outwardly upstanding 
citizen who drives his daughter to violence with his sexual abuse). 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the themes that preoccupied De La Soul the most were its own standing 
in a rap universe, and the conflict between musical creativeness and the 
distracting blandishments of riches and fame. What came across most clearly, 
both in raps and between-songs declarations, was an anti-stardom ethic that's 
more common to punk rock than to hip-hop, where boasting of one's status and 
ability to "get paid" is commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
 While they performed several raps from "3 Feet High," Posdnuos and Trugoy 
seemed leery of their most successful album. "We hate this song," the rappers 
chanted as a lead-in to their debut album's biggest hit, the affirmative 
declaration of individuality, "Me Myself And I." The duo couldn't finish it 
without cracking up in laughter down the home stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't come up here to boast that we're rap stars," Trugoy announced near 
the end of the show. "We're just three individuals who do what we love."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That set the stage for an effectively taunting version of the show-closing 
"Ring Ring Ring (Ha Ha Hey)." In it, the rappers mocked people who want to fly 
in the orbit of stars, either opportunistically to further their own ambitions, 
or to bolster their egos with the perceived status derived from contact with 
the rich and famous. 
</P>
<P>
 While Trugoy's lead-in was idealistic, De La Soul's stance in "Ring Ring Ring" 
-- and several others like it -- is more than a little jaded and embittered, 
especially in light of the trio's hopeful debut album. But it's still a 
praiseworthy outlook to have. The lust for celebrity news and celebrity contact 
-- and the growing dominance of media devoted to satisfying that lust -- has 
grown keener than is healthy for a democracy founded on the notion that 
aristocracy and its privileges are inherently corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 For performers like De La Soul, who attract the media spotlight, the challenge 
is to keep outside pressures and temptations from compromising the creative 
process. But with its creative balloon having deflated considerably on 
"Buhloone Mindstate," leaving it in danger of becoming just another rap act, 
this once-distinctive group has its work cut out for it.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; KELLY TAKES CROWD UP, THEN DOWN WITH THUMP; LEWD SONGS GIVE 
WAY TO IMPASSIONED TRIBUTE TO HIS LATE MOTHER, FOLLOWED BY LASCIVIOUS ENCORE AT 
THE POND'S BUDFEST.

 What is with R. Kelly?  
</P>
<P>
 Headlining the rap/R&B Budfest at the Pond of Anaheim on Friday, the red-hot 
singer-producer closed his set with one of the weirdest, most schizophrenic 
juxtapositions of songs ever heard in an R&B concert. 
</P>
<P>
 After an hour of steamy, lewd songs such as his hit "Bump N' Grind," he sang 
"Sadie," an impassioned homage to his late mother, complete with a picture of 
her on the stage. Actually, sang is an understatement. What Kelly did was 
frenzied, all-out, gospel-style wailing that went for a good 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Kelly announced the show was over. Clearly bewildered by the abrupt, 
somber climax, the audience started filing out, but after about five minutes he 
decided to do an encore. On this last, lascivious song, he not only did his 
usual sex-act simulation, but also finished with a flourish -- with his pants 
down (he was wearing briefs). 
</P>
<P>
 What possessed Kelly to follow an anguished, heartfelt ode to his mother with 
such a raunchy performance? Though he obviously didn't intend it that way, it 
came across as downright disrespectful.  
</P>
<P>
 Subtract "Sadie" and it wasn't a bad show for fans of ribald R&B. Kelly is a 
pretty fair singer, but what his fans -- mostly shrieking women -- really care 
about, and what really drives his show is his mastery of the art of sexual 
teasing. Women squealed with delight at his bedroom chatter and sexy antics, 
which included crotch-grabbing and simulated sex with his female dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The preceding set by the rap group Heavy D & the Boyz had the same sexual 
theme, but the approach was lighthearted. After all, how seriously can you take 
a portly rapper who comes on like God's gift to women? It didn't matter that 
Heavy D's rapping skills are barely average. Thanks to his lovable persona, his 
show is a lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>
 But the set by Long Beach rapper Warren G was a disaster. He suffered through 
the nightmare of any artist who relies on taped instrumental tracks -- 
sound-system failure. Furious, he led the crowd in an obscene blast against the 
sound man, but some fans weren't too sympathetic. One screamed out that the G 
in his name apparently stands for goof . 
</P>
<P>
 The show was opened by a short set by Coolio.

 Good Night, Robin: Anchor Robert MacNeil will announce next week that he plans 
to retire from PBS' "The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" sometime next year, public 
television sources confirmed. The native Canadian, who will turn 65 in January, 
1996, and his co-anchor, Jim Lehrer, will be celebrating their 20th year 
together in 1995. MacNeil, a prize-winning author, reportedly has several book 
projects in the works. Among MacNeil's published works is the best-selling 
"Wordstruck" (1989). Sources said plans call for Lehrer to continue as solo 
anchor of "News-Hour" when MacNeil steps down, with the operation consolidated 
in Washington. MacNeil presently anchors from New York.

 Stallone-Stone in No. 1: Warner Bros.' "The Specialist" demolished the 
competition at the box office during the weekend. The movie starring Sylvester 
Stallone and Sharon Stone grossed $14.3 million its first weekend in release 
for the top spot, according to early industry estimates. There was a sharp drop 
to second place: Universal's "The River Wild" took in $7 million. "Only You," 
the new romantic comedy from TriStar Pictures, was third with $5.8 million. 
Paramount's "Forrest Gump," still holding strong in its 14th week, finished in 
fourth place with $3.9 million. And in fifth was Gramercy Pictures' "Jason's 
Lyric" with $3.5 million.

 Native Americans Speak Out: An entertainment industry organization is 
criticizing the portrayal of Native Americans in film and television, calling 
the images demeaning and unrealistic. The group, American Indians in Film, said 
it's calling for a halt to the casting of non-Native Americans as Native 
Americans, and demanding that Native Americas be given equal opportunities in 
front of and behind the camera. "We the American Indian, the original 
inhabitants of this land, cannot and will not stand idly or passively by and 
allow the mediums of film and television to distort and fictionalize the images 
and lifestyles of our people," said the group's founder, Sonny Skyhawk. The 
organization said it will monitor film and TV projects to determine if its 
concerns are being addressed. ART

 Rembrandt Stolen: A burglar with a sledgehammer smashed a window at the 
Rembrandt House Museum in Amsterdam on Sunday and stole a painting attributed 
to the Old Master. The missing painting was "Man With a Beard," dated 1647. Its 
value was not immediately available. It was the second smash-and-grab burglary 
in three months at the museum, which was once the artist's home. In July, the 
front door was broken in and thieves took two paintings by Rembrandt's teacher, 
Pieter Lastman. They have not been recovered. POP/ROCK

 Shakur Cleared in Atlanta: Prosecutors in Atlanta have dropped aggravated 
assault charges against rapper Tupac Shakur because of conflicting statements 
by witnesses. The charges stemmed from a 1993 incident in downtown Atlanta in 
which Shakur exchanged gunfire with two off-duty police officers. Shakur, 23, 
claimed that he fired in self-defense. QUICK TAKES

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; MEMPHIS' ELVIS TRIBUTE A FEAST NOT FIT FOR THE KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH KLEID and CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ladies and gentlemen, Elvis is so far out of the building it isn't funny. 
</P>
<P>
 It was evident a week or two ago that Saturday's live pay-per-view event, 
"Elvis: The Tribute" (cablecast direct from the Pyramid Arena in Memphis) would 
be short on the superstar talent originally projected. No Bruce Springsteen and 
no U2? No problem. Michael and Lisa Marie Jackson will just be doing the Queen 
Mum wave again, not singing? So be it. 
</P>
<P>
 But the lineup of nearly 30 wanna-be Elvises here -- commencing with Sammy 
Hagar, climaxing with Melissa Etheridge, and featuring folks like Marty Stuart, 
Michael Hutchence, Faith Hill, Bryan Adams and Michael Bolton doing one song 
each -- ultimately looked more a low-grade Farm Aid bill than a feast fit for a 
King. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-star finale had no less inspirational a figure than Billy Ray Cyrus 
doing lead vocals (and, ulp, gospel gyrations) on a group sing of "Amazing 
Grace." As he belted out the line, "When we've been there 10,000 years," it 
felt less like the hope of glory deferred than a description of the preceding 2 
1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Though home viewers didn't get a single electrifying moment for their $25, a 
decent handful of performers at least acquitted themselves: Dwight Yoakam, more 
swivel-ankled than swivel-hipped this night, definitely had a little Elvis in 
him on "Mystery Train," though twangy guitar pardner Pete Anderson's was the 
flashier stage presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Isaak was an obviously good choice for an understated "Blue Moon," 
accompanied by members of Elvis' original combo plus a churning organ swell. 
Chet Atkins, weak of voice and strong of fret, charmed as always. John Cale 
claimed the closest thing to a substantial reinterpretation with a 
semi-successful, drowsily psychodramatic reading of "Heartbreak Hotel," the 
perversity of which clearly left the Memphis audience either stunned or asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those less successfully rounding out this hunka hunka burnin' flab: Iggy 
Pop failing to "Rip It Up," Tanya Tucker badly vamping "Teddy Bear," Jerry Lee 
Lewis' perfunctory "C.C. Rider," Tony Bennett looking cheerfully lost on "Love 
Me Tender," co-host Kris Kristofferson's attempt at carrying the tune of 
"That's All Right," and a head-scratcher duet between Eddie Rabbitt and Mavis 
Staples on "Suspicious Minds," two singers in two styles trying too hard. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyrus' achy-breaky "One Night With You" or Bolton's bolt-out-of-your-seat 
"Jailhouse Rock," you don't even want to know about. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosting the telecast were Kristofferson and MTV's Karen Duffy, whose 
mismatched cross-generational banter (Karen to Kris: "I wasn't around when 
Elvis was conquering the world -- what was it like?") resembled a log and a 
chipmunk trying to relate. 
</P>
<P>
 Three bands provided decent support: one a younger crew led by the concert's 
musical director Don Was, another featuring original Elvis cohorts Scotty Moore 
and D.J. Fontana, and NRBQ as the third (and least utilized) backup. CHRIS

 "The maestro wants to play some more," announced actor Andy Garcia as shouts 
of " Otra! " ("Another one!") thundered through the House of Blues on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 From the look of it, the maestro -- bassist and composer Israel (Cachao) Lopez 
-- would have gladly played until dawn if it weren't for club regulations.As it 
was, the 75-year-old Cuban legend gave Sunset Strip a rare infusion of Cuba's 
Tropicana sound, leading a large band that included some of Latin jazz's 
best-known names in a rapturous evening of Cuban music. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the sound system wasn't up to par with the music, and many of 
Cachao's improvisatory recitatives were lost initially to a scratchy sound and, 
later, just swallowed up by the room's din. This didn't prevent the sold-out 
crowd from attempting to dance to the contagious music, although there was 
virtually no space to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosted by Garcia, who has become Cachao's latter-day patron, the evening 
marked the second Los Angeles appearance of the man many credit with inventing 
the mambo in the 1930s. It was Garcia who "rediscovered" Cachao with his 1992 
film "Cachao," after the musician had languished for years playing birthday 
parties in Miami. On Saturday, Cachao's descargas, or jam sessions, were 
highlighted by superb solos from the likes of trumpeter Alfredo (Chocolate) 
Armenteros, tenor saxophonist Justo Almario, conguero Francisco Aguabella, tres 
player Nelson Gonzalez and flutist Artie Webb, among others. LEILA COBO-HANLON

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; CANDLEBOX: METAL THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Since Nirvana's ascent to pop stardom, many newfangled sounds from what was 
once rock's underground have found broad audiences, in effect widening the 
mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are still a lot of fans who want their rock kicks served up the 
old-fashioned way -- slow, straight, loud and as heavy as possible.Those tastes 
have helped propel the debut album from Seattle's Candlebox firmly into the Top 
10 on the sales charts.  
</P>
<P>
 On Friday at the Palladium, the quartet held forth with a full-throttle set of 
its bloozy bombast. With a seemingly endless supply of ponderous guitar riffs 
and elephantine beats, the band created some hefty accompaniment for singer 
Kevin Martin's explosive assertions of fury and confusion.  
</P>
<P>
 The group delivered dynamic performances of "Change," "Cover Me" and some new 
material, and allowed itself some impressive stretching on "No Sense," but 
often the music was a one-note mix of heavy rhythm and over-the-top rage.  
</P>
<P>
 The band didn't shy away from its classic rock roots, dedicating one song to 
Carlos Santana and working chunks of the Doors and Jimi Hendrix into others. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin is a powerful presence on stage, although his outsize emoting can 
approach self-conscious melodrama. Those big feelings clearly connected with 
the crowd, and the singer eagerly tossed himself into the sea of outstretched 
hands and later pulled up a few eager fans to the stage.  
</P>
<P>
 Candlebox has revived the thunderous rumble of high-grade heavy metal. Their 
roar may be predictable, but it is formidable. CHUCK CRISAFULLI

 Introducing her cheerfully agnostic anthem "Let the Mystery Be," Iris DeMent 
made note on Friday at the Troubadour that she almost hadn't recorded her most 
famous tune for fear of upsetting her Pentecostal mother. 
</P>
<P>
 After singing it, she added, "Turns out she likes that song.I don't know if 
she's ever listened to the words; she's always wonderin' where the fast, happy 
ones are, and that falls into that category." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the country-folk singer is every bit as gifted at writing the fast, 
happy ones as the unrepentant heart-tuggers for which she probably enjoys the 
greater esteem. And she sets the agnosticism aside long enough to make wondrous 
forays into pure, exultant gospel. 
</P>
<P>
 Great as DeMent's two instrumentally understated albums are, she's even finer 
solo, unadorned but for guitar or piano (and a guest accordion on three tunes 
here), with no comforting dobro to distract from her unassumingly stunning 
writing and the winsome, anachronistic authority of her 78-speed warble. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Emmylou Harris, Jimmie Dale and John Prine before her, DeMent made the 
speed of the sound of loneliness seem to proceed on hauntingly slow Midwest, 
not West Hollywood, time.CHRIS WILLMAN

DANCE; NYC BALLET PRINCIPALS: WITHOUT BALANCHINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If George Balanchine's heirs suddenly withdrew his choreography, what exactly 
would be the interest and importance of New York City Ballet? 
</P>
<P>
 The question isn't entirely hypothetical, since a 20-member company billed as 
Principal Dancers of New York City Ballet presented three programs over the 
weekend at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts without including a 
single Balanchine work. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, they'd announced a repertory dominated by Balanchine, but dropped his 
works due to a contract dispute with the Balanchine Trust. Moreover, by the 
time the company arrived in Cerritos, dancer injuries forced it to revise its 
program revisions -- already choreographically undistinctive -- even further. 
</P>
<P>
 Three pieces by Peter Martins exploited the unprecedented speed and intricacy 
that Balanchine developed as a touchstone of NYCB technique. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Barber Violin Concerto," Martins depicted a flirtation between elegant, 
academic classicism (more plausibly embodied by the radiant Kyra Nichols than 
the effortful Nilas Martins, son Peter) and gnarled, hyperactive modernism 
(represented by a manic Stacey Calvert and a brooding Jock Soto). 
</P>
<P>
 In a duet from "Ecstatic Orange" (cautiously executed by Soto and Heather 
Watts), Martins launched convoluted partnering gambits using music by Michael 
Torke. And in "Ash," he used Torke to create a hard-sell, high-velocity 
showpiece that left Martins-the-Younger looking winded but found Wendy Whelan 
in her element. 
</P>
<P>
 Whelan's talent for spectacular contortions-on-pointe also distinguished the 
intriguing pas de deux from William Forsythe's "Herman Schmerman," created for 
NYCB to music by Thom Willems. However, Whelan proved less adept at defining 
the mock-hostile mood of the piece than her partner, Albert Evans. 
</P>
<P>
 Something else was missing as well. When Sylvie Guillem danced this same duet 
at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in May, she wore a transparent 
black gauze top over bare breasts. Whelan wore the same black gauze on Saturday 
-- but over an undergarment. Since Forsythe built costume changes (and a parody 
thereof) into the structure of the piece, the loss proved more than merely 
decorative. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans also danced brilliantly in "Viola Alone," a quartet by former Tharp and 
American Ballet Theatre dancer Kevin O'Day set to Hindemith pieces composed 
over nearly two decades. O'Day seldom successfully bridged the drastic shifts 
in musical style, but his technical arsenal and sense of contemporary 
locker-room banter certainly suited Evans, Calvert, Melinda Roy and Damian 
Woetzel. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether danced by a serene Lourdes Lopez and an ardent Ben Huys on Friday, or 
by a glazed Roy with Huys on Saturday, the "Romeo and Juliet" pas de deux 
choreographed by former company principal Sean Lavery looked fluent but 
generalized -- out of sync with many permutations in Prokoviev's score. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, City Ballet principal Woetzel's two creations suffered from musical 
insensitivity. Indeed, he managed to undercut his own technical brilliance and 
make even Nichols look unmusical throughout his "Glazunov Pas de Deux." He also 
inflicted arbitrary shifts in impetus and activity on the exemplary Soto and 
the vivacious Jenifer Ringer in "Ebony Concerto" (music by Stravinsky). 
</P>
<P>
 Group passages in the latter, however, confirmed his promise as a 
choreographer. And as a dancer he unleashed his honed, Balanchinian exactitude 
on the 19th-Century warhorses garnishing the repertory. Opposite a tense but 
promising Kelly Cass in the "Corsaire" duet, he gave his flamboyance full rein. 
But he offered a far classier performance in the "Don Quixote" pas de deux 
opposite guest artist Paloma Herrera. 
</P>
<P>
 And no wonder. The big news at American Ballet Theatre this season, Herrera 
dances with extraordinary freshness and an ability to flow through positions 
with great aplomb, gathering electricity on her way to drop-dead terminations. 
As Kitri, she also ventured a series of sustained unsupported balances that 
looked like tantalizing down payments on a Rose Adagio. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Herrera proved the clear victor in a virtual Swan Sweepstakes -- 
the Black Swan, White Swan and "Dying Swan" showpieces all on the same program. 
(What, no "Swan of Tuonela"?) Her Ballet Theatre colleague Julie Kent had 
danced a diligent, small-scaled, passionless Odette (opposite Huys) on Friday, 
then brought these same qualities to the Fokine solo the next night. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez's Saturday Odette (opposite Soto) had also been diligent -- and more 
imposing in scale -- but hardly inspired. Which left Herrera's 
kitten-with-a-whip Odile (opposite Huys) seeming even sharper, freer and more 
technically lush.

THEATER; REDGRAVE'S BITTERSWEET MEMORIES OF HER 'FATHER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Another quasi-therapeutic play about a parent-child relationship may sound 
ho-hum. But when the parent is Michael Redgrave, the daughter is Lynn Redgrave, 
and her solo show is stitched together by their mutual passion for Shakespeare, 
it becomes something of a special event. 
</P>
<P>
 All too special, here in the actress' adopted home town of Los Angeles. Her 
"Shakespeare for My Father" began in these parts -- with a few performances in 
Santa Barbara, Cerritos and Palm Desert -- before becoming a Broadway hit. But 
when it finally returned over the weekend, it played only three performances at 
UCLA's Freud Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 An earlier plan to play the Henry Fonda Theatre for a longer run was thwarted 
by earthquake damage to the Fonda. The show is now booked into Australia and 
London, but at least Redgrave found the time to kick off UK/LA's "3 x 3" series 
at the Freud. Perhaps she'll eventually bring the show back for a longer stay. 
</P>
<P>
 This is no fond reminiscence of dear old dad. To hear his daughter talk, 
Michael was a distant, intimidating father who didn't even take note of her 
1943 birth in his journal. However, he later gave her a volume of Shakespeare. 
In its pages -- and in her father's performances -- she finally forged an 
almost spiritual bond with him that was missing in most of their actual 
encounters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In her script, Redgrave interpolates apt lines from Shakespeare into her 
personal memories. For example, she sees herself as Cordelia to Michael's Lear. 
</P>
<P>
 The classical language and Redgrave's own contemporary lines mingle with ease, 
and the actress gets to show her stuff in men's roles as well as women's, as 
both Juliet and her Nurse, as Portia and Cleopatra and even Richard II. She has 
a commanding voice that easily negotiates several octaves, and she holds a 
stage without strain. Why hasn't she done Shakespeare in L.A.? 
</P>
<P>
 She portrays a wide range of other characters -- from Noel Coward to Maggie 
Smith to Richard Burton to a burly stagehand. She touches briefly and movingly 
on her mother, Rachel Kempson, particularly in the stressful period when 
Michael Redgrave had Parkinson's disease (he died in 1985.) 
</P>
<P>
 She does a fascinating bit as her own grandmother, Michael's mother, who 
relates how she treated her young son as a parcel, shuttling him between 
relatives. Meanwhile, we hear how Michael's father never saw him after he was a 
baby. Perhaps it's not too surprising that Michael didn't know how to be a 
parent. Left unsaid, however, is any mention of Michael's oft-reported 
bisexuality or whether it affected his home life. 
</P>
<P>
 A dim image of Michael looks on from the back of the stage -- as if from a 
distance, of course, and we hear brief snippets of his voice. But he's almost 
as much of a ghost here as Hamlet's father -- another analogy noted in the 
play. Nonetheless, the show is generally light on its feet, with more humor 
than rancor, capped by a final litany of Lynn's relatively few happy memories. 
Her husband, John Clark, directed. 
</P>
<P>
 * "3 x 3: Great Solo Performances" continues at the Freud Playhouse with

COUNTERPUNCH: C'MON, HOWARD, WE ALL WANT BETTER NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CINDY VANDOR, Cindy Vandor is a veteran TV reporter who has won two Golden 
Mike Awards and has been nominated for Emmy Awards four times. She has worked 
for NBC, KCAL, KTTV, CNN and The Wall Street Journal TV Report based in New 
York.

 There can be reasons to criticize the ways that local news uses live shots. 
But Howard Rosenberg's criticism of News Director Larry Perret's memo about the 
ways that Channel 2 should use live shots was just plain wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "A frightening memo," Rosenberg blasts Perret's advice to his news team 
("Bringing Closure to Anchors' Glibness," Calendar, Sept. 23). 
</P>
<P>
 What is this awful thing that Perret decrees? He says, "The anchors must 
provide a sense of closure to these (live) stories." That this frightens Howard 
Rosenberg frightens me. 
</P>
<P>
 I have done probably hundreds of live TV reports. For seven years I worked as 
a reporter in local TV newsrooms managed by Larry Perret. His priorities have 
never been, as Rosenberg writes, "scripted performances," "theatrics" or to 
"prop up news anchors." 
</P>
<P>
 What Perret wants is what viewers want -- news delivered in an accurate, 
timely, clear and compelling way, with a beginning, a middle and an end. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm now on the other side of the tube, happy to be a stay-at-home mom. I watch 
live reports from the viewer's point of view now. And I'm often frustrated by 
the lack of clarity and context. Just because a report is live is no excuse for 
stinting on good storytelling. Since live reports start off and end up at the 
anchor desk, logically anchors should have a part in crafting good stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg's own high and mighty medium accomplishes this with many other 
elements besides reporters' words. Articles start off with headlines. In TV 
news, the anchor introduction is the headline. Would Rosenberg do away with 
headlines? He scoffs at anchors providing closure -- would he kill their 
openings too? "Anchorless" newscasts don't work. It's been tried. And it's too 
confusing. 
</P>
<P>
 But a major concern is how, in Perret's words, to keep anchors from "simply 
playing the role of traffic cop." That was his reason for the memo and it is an 
important problem because it does significantly impact viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 You may not realize why you don't like a badly produced newscast but, trust 
me, you won't like it if anchors bounce from live report to live report, 
without pause for context or the simple human need to take a moment to absorb 
what you've just seen and heard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Newspapers do this too. Important stories run with sidebars, which might 
contain additional information, add context, give perspective or insight, or 
historical perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 That is exactly what Perret asked of his anchors. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoting his memo: "The anchors should provide additional information, add 
context, give perspective or insight, or historical perspective. Any of the 
above will help give a sense of closure to a live report." 
</P>
<P>
 When newspaper editors write memos about this, it's touted as comprehensive 
coverage. Yet when a smart news director wants to do the same thing, it's 
criticized as slick packaging. Come on. 
</P>
<P>
 One further point that Rosenberg should have learned long ago: The logistics 
involved in getting a lot of live shots into a daily newscast are daunting. 
Good reporters and anchors try to brief each other before they go on-air but 
there's usually not enough time. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchors have many stories to prepare for. Reporters have only one. So it's 
rightly up to the reporter to communicate information to a writer or producer, 
who is responsible for getting all the elements of a report ready for air. 
Writers and producers arrange graphics, identify interviewees and locations, 
and help check facts, among many other crucial tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 At Channel 2 now (as he did at Channel 9 and Channel 11), Perret also wants 
writers and producers to provide additional information that anchors can use to 
draw a live report to a conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 I've been doing this successfully for years. I prefer to talk directly to 
anchors about my reports. I may tell them where to advise viewers to go for 
more information, or I may engage anchors in a discussion about a controversy 
brewing over the story I just did.  
</P>
<P>
 I try, but in the real world of breaking news and relentless deadlines, 
there's rarely time to talk directly. So I call a writer or producer. They are 
the link between the field and the studio. They are valued professionals -- not 
unheralded, underpaid puppeteers pulling the strings of anchors' lips, as 
Rosenberg would wrongly have you believe.

COUNTERPUNCH: HOME RUN FOR BURNS, PBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELF GIBBONS, Elf Gibbons, a die-hard Chicago Cubs fan, is a 1993 graduate of 
UCLA, an artist and writer living in Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The problem, perhaps, with Saul Halpert's dislike of "Baseball" is that he 
spent 40 years working for TV news. Considering the lack of time historically 
afforded television news coverage, Halpert might be forgiven his lack of 
appreciation for a serious production that dares take the time necessary to 
tell a story, especially a story as deep and rich as the history of baseball (" 
'Baseball' Ran on Interminably, Illustrating Why PBS Falls Short," Calendar, 
Oct. 3). 
</P>
<P>
 In his meticulously researched project, Ken Burns brought America's pastime to 
life with a thoroughness rarely found in television. PBS should be applauded 
for giving creative rein to such a deserving filmmaker. Ratings are nice but 
art is timeless. And since time is the enemy in network programming, how 
refreshing that PBS proved, once again, that Burns is worth spending time on. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if "interminable scenes of grainy, scratchy black-and-white old film" 
bored Halpert, if documentary footage of America's dusty side streets and 
ballparks and playing fields held no value for him, then viewers like him might 
be better off with a sitcom or aHollywood film in which everything is neatly 
wrapped both in color and 22 or 90 minutes. But if someone is genuinely 
interested in the history and impact of baseball in America, then he or she 
could do no better than to settle back and luxuriate in Burns' loving tribute. 
</P>
<P>
 The painstaking care that Burns and his editors took in assembling this 
project makes the fact that it ever found its way to home plate all the more 
astonishing. "Baseball" flies in the face of what we've come to know and expect 
from television. And that is, for the most part, homogenized, tasteless, 
artless, humorless offerings that sell advertisements instead of entertainment, 
that numb our spirits instead of enlightening our minds, that simply waste our 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Halpert argues that Burns could have produced a program "with greater economy, 
skill and dramatic impact" that would then have "drawn a bigger audience." In 
ridiculing Burns' method of storytelling, the former TV reporter misses the 
ball, and the point, by miles. What Burns did was allow the story of baseball 
to unfold before our eyes. In doing so, he enabled us to grasp not only the 
historical importance of our cherished national pastime but also the power of 
baseball as metaphor for life itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the inning format was hardly "too-cutesy" as Halpert suggests. In 
dividing the program into nine two-hour segments, Burns presented baseball as 
the constant backdrop for a changing nation. The end results were both 
fascinating and surprising, the lessons learned sad yet inspirational.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure other viewers found themselves wishing for extra innings when the 
game finally ended. I came away from this extraordinary experience a more 
informed American -- and not just about baseball. With this magnificent effort, 
Burns underscored the undeniable connection between baseball and life in a 
country still struggling to reach home. 
</P>

 Similarly, City Ballet principal Woetzel's two creations suffered from musical

make even Nichols look unmusical throughout his "Glazunov Pas de Deux." He also 
inflicted arbitrary shifts in impetus and activity on the exemplary Soto and 
the vivacious Jenifer Ringer in "Ebony Concerto" (music by Stravinsky). 
</P>
<P>
 Group passages in the latter, however, confirmed his promise as a

promising Kelly Cass in the "Corsaire" duet, he gave his flamboyance full rein. 
But he offered a far classier performance in the "Don Quixote" pas de deux

 The Cerritos house program pointedly advised ticket-holders that "this 
presentation is produced by Columbia Artists, not New York City Ballet," then 
offered a cornucopia of misinformation. ("THE DYING SWAN, music: Samuel Barber, 
choreography: Peter Martins.") 
</P>
<P>
 Even the program correction sheet handed out at the end of the Friday 
performance listed Martins as the choreographer of the White Swan pas de deux. 
And, of course, the conductors and musicians providing the taped accompaniments 
were never credited.

 Since some doubts have been voiced in The Times about the historical 
authenticity of the movie "Quiz Show" and since the movie is based on something 
I wrote and since I have been involved intermittently with the film's 
production during the last six years, I feel it appropriate, in the shared 
interest of accuracy, to make a few comments (" 'Quiz Show': The Pattern Still 
Lives" and "The Ethics of a Movie on the Quiz Show Scandal," Sept. 19). 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously the rendering of a historical episode into a drama necessitated some 
changes in the recorded facts. Indeed, one would be hard-pressed to name a 
similar effort in the last three centuries of historical drama that did not do 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Redford has not only created a fine work but has also remained 
remarkably faithful to the actual events. I was impressed throughout the making 
of this film with Redford's almost obsessive attention to establishing a sound 
historical basis for both the facts and the emotional realities of his 
characters. There is hardly a scene that does not have a counterpart in real 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Much the same is true of the portrayal of my own role in conducting the 
investigation. Naturally, I was helped -- as I have written -- by the fine work 
of Assistant Dist. Atty. Joseph Stone. Nevertheless, the central story of the 
film -- the dramatic public exposure of a rather large fraud and, more 
poignant, the undoing of Charles Van Doren, was, indeed, the work of the 
congressional committee for which I then conducted the investigation. This can 
be clearly demonstrated by the abundance of contemporaneous material in my 
possession -- including the letter that Van Doren wrote me after the hearings 
-- which material I used both in writing my book and working with the 
scriptwriter. It is available to any journalist who wishes to independently 
ascertain the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor, might I add, has Redford treated any of the characters unfairly. Indeed, 
in most cases he has struggled -- successfully -- to make them, if anything, 
more sympathetic on screen than they appeared to me at the time, with the 
exception of Van Doren, for whom I felt, and still feel, affection. But that 
remains now -- as it was then -- a matter of empathetic judgment.

MUSIC REVIEW; 1,000 PERFORM IN HOLLYWOOD BOWL'S MASSIVE 'DAIKU' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the spirit of bigger is better and more is more, more than 1,000 performers 
from Japan and the United States got together for Beethoven's Ninth Symphony -- 
or, "Daiku," meaning "nine," as it is familiarly known in Japan -- at Hollywood 
Bowl Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Beethoven survived. 
</P>
<P>
 In imitation of even more massive Ninths sung annually in Japan, this event 
was the first of what the organizers hope will be yearly "Daiku" concerts here. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiroshi Ishimaru, a onetime student of Herbert von Karajan and apparently one 
of Japan's top conductors, duplicated his Sumida City, Japan, role as leader of 
the throng. The Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and the Japan America Symphony 
combined to form the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven Southland choirs and three from Japan -- 947 singers in all -- coalesced 
into the vocal battalion. In attendance were 14,828 listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 Since a bleacher-type arrangement to accommodate the choirs had been set up 
within the Bowl shell, the orchestras themselves sat atop a stage well in front 
of the structure, with a resulting loss of power and luster to their sound. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first half, Heiichiro Ohyama -- conductor of the Japan America Symphony 
-- led the orchestras in a generous and detailed account of Dvorak's "New 
World" Symphony, taking time to explore its byways, in a well-groomed 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 After all of the singers settled themselves, the 72-year-old Ishimaru 
delivered a stately and gracious reading of the Ninth, finding dramatic 
breadth, despite amplification imbalances, where he needed it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the finale, baritone Toshimitsu Kimura and tenor Mark Thomsen resolutely 
belted out their solos and swamped what sounded like solid contributions from 
soprano Yukie Okura and mezzo-soprano Nancy Maultsby. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, the choirs -- including the Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles and the 
Korean Master Chorale (also local) -- made a big noise but, not so naturally, 
not a laborious one. They sang with neatness and spirit, becoming woolly in 
only one of Beethoven's more complex sections. 
</P>
<P>
 Ishimaru even stood back and put his hands down once, letting them go 
confidently on their own. Probably nothing was going to stop them anyway.

SCREENING ROOM: 'HOME' SHORTS KICK OFF FALL SEASON AT FILMFORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Filmforum, the alternative cinema showcase, begins its fall programming 
tonight at 7:30 at the Hollywood Moguls, 1650 Schrader St. (formerly Hudson), 
with the 80-minute "Home Is Where the Heart Is (Not)," composed of six intense 
and surreal short films expressing the trauma of childhood. Most impressive is 
Jay Rosenblatt's "The Smell of Burning Ants," in which he reprocesses found 
footage in a way to reveal how boys are conditioned to be aggressive, even 
sadistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Moritsugu's 68-minute "Mod F--- Explosion" (at 9:30, separate admission), 
a real discovery, is a dynamic punk odyssey of a pair of innocent teens adrift 
in a violent urban world; Moritsugu unleashes a barrage of powerful images and 
hard-driving music. 
</P>
<P>
 Marriage and Survival: On Nov. 7, 1942, in the ghetto of Riga, Latvia, Helma 
and Benno Schneider pledged their love for each other in the presence of 
Helma's parents and thereafter considered themselves married. Fifty years later 
in Los Angeles, their son, TV producer Sascha Schneider, organized a 
traditional Jewish wedding for his parents, and he and his wife, Laurie 
Zemelman-Schneider, documented not only the ceremony, which climaxes the 
profoundly emotional "Chuppa: The Wedding Canopy" (at the Sunset 5 for one 
week) but also persuaded his parents to talk about their miraculous Holocaust 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, the younger Schneiders discuss their need to preserve their 
Jewish heritage while establishing more firmly their own identity and 
relationship; for them the ceremony becomes, beyond a healing and closure for 
Helma and Benno, a symbol of their own independence for Sascha and Laurie. This 
remarkable dimension of the 80-minute film is handled with both the utmost 
honesty and sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
 All in the Family: The consistently outrageous and imaginative 1989 "Dr. 
Caligari" returns this week Fridays and Saturdays at midnight at the Sunset 5. 
It would have us believe that the evil director of the insane in the classic 
"Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" has a granddaughter who wants to take up where he 
left more than 75 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The current Dr. Caligari (Madeleine Reynal) presides over her asylum (by a 
toxic waste dump) like a mad dominatrix, and her victim-patients are all caught 
up in extravagant, crazed indulgences in sex and drugs. Director-designer 
Stephen Sayadian and his co-writer Jerry Stahl, who made that other 
midnight-circuit hit "Cafe Flesh," have created a darkly hilarious satire of 
contemporary aberrations and the gobbledygook we use to describe them.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: MULTICULTURAL 
MANNERS; BE APPRECIATIVE, 'ACT LIKE A PIG' 
</P>

 Donna and her family have just arrived from the Philippines. American friends, 
the Gordons, invite them over for a welcoming dinner.At the end of the meal, 
Donna's brother, Peter, belches loudly. The visiting family pays little 
attention to his behavior, but the Gordons think Peter acts like a pig. 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 Peter was attempting to show how much he enjoyed the Gordons' food. In many 
areas of the Philippines, as well as in Saudi Arabia, belching is considered a 
compliment to the chef. As in other parts of Asia and Indonesia, table noises 
including noodle slurping and lip smacking are the sounds of satisfied diners.  
</P>
<P>
 American table manners sometimes revolt others. Many foreigners find it 
repugnant when Americans eat corn on the cob, believed to be more suited for 
livestock than humans. Europeans, especially, consider it uncouth to hold the 
cob in one's hands with butter or margarine dripping onto the fingers and chin. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of dining etiquette in the U.S. has been influenced by European 
traditions. Yet even in Europe, bodily sounds such as belching, passing gas, 
coughing, hiccuping, sneezing, commonly punctuated dining events until the 16th 
Century, when these noises became socially taboo. 
</P>
<P>
 Rule: Depending on who does it, belching at the table is not necessarily a 
sign of rudeness.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: COMMUNITY COMMENT; 
'WHEN THE GROUPS STARTED, IT WAS LIKE BEING SAVED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By P.J. VIVIANSAYLES, 45, is founder and president of the Women of Color Breast 
Cancer Survivors Support Project in Los Angeles and Pomona. She talked with 
ROBIN GREENE about the extra burdens faced by minority women who have the 
disease. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I found out I had breast cancer in the summer of 1991 and I needed 
chemotherapy, it threw me. I never believed in self-help groups. Even when I 
was working for the Women and AIDS Risk Network, I wouldn't participate in 
their sessions. I'd just sit there typing. 
</P>
<P>
 But this cancer was very devastating for me. I knew I wasn't the only one 
going through this. I needed to talk to somebody else who was experiencing 
this. I asked Dr. Oscar Streeter, a radiology oncologist at County-USC, if 
there were any support groups for African American women. He said, "No." I was 
in a state of fear. I thought I was going to die. I didn't know you could 
survive breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Dr. Streeter introduced me to some people working for the National 
Black Leadership Initiative on Cancer. By that time, I was really angry. The 
local support groups available to me were on Wilshire Boulevard or in Santa 
Monica. My car had died, I'm on disability, my income was cut by two-thirds and 
it was a three-hour bus ride to the nearest support group. I'm used to riding 
the buses but what about women making minimum wage who have children and just 
can't miss work? 
</P>
<P>
 The NBLIC gave me emotional support as well as the support to develop the 
Women of Color Breast Cancer Survivors Project. During this, I had a spiritual 
experience. I became aware of all the women who died behind me with no one to 
talk to. I was determined to start this group. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was talking about breast cancer because there's a taboo in the African 
American community. Everyone's very hush-hush. We just don't talk about things 
like that. People used to believe that you could catch it, that if the doctor 
cut on you, it would spread. 
</P>
<P>
 Every week for six months my friend and support group vice president, Beverly 
Rhine, and I would put announcements in the paper and go on the radio but no 
one was showing up. There was one component we forgot. We live in Los Angeles 
and in Los Angeles women are not going to come out at night. We decided to have 
a Saturday morning session and that's when things started changing. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, we have two groups. One meets the second Saturday of every month at 
Daniel Freeman Hospital. The other is in Pomona and that meets the third 
Saturday of the month. We have 150 breast cancer survivors in our database and 
an average of 25 to 40 women show up for the support groups. 
</P>
<P>
 When these groups started going, it was unbelievable. It was like being found, 
being saved. Women were telling us they didn't know they could survive, that 
their families didn't understand. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman was crying when she came to us. She said she didn't think there was 
anything for African American women. She had gone to a support group in Santa 
Monica, and here she is telling these women about her experience and they 
couldn't relate. They're muckety-mucks and she was a poor woman. And then one 
woman has the audacity, at the end of the session, to ask this woman who had 
just poured out her life story to clean her house! 
</P>
<P>
 Now we have a grass-roots organization that is ultimately going to spread 
across the country. Women are calling us. We have no administrative funds. 
We're still doing this by hook or by crook. We now are in partnership with 
Daniel Freeman Hospital in Inglewood and they provide us with a support group 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 African American women definitely are not getting the same quality of medicine 
as other women. That is a fact. You go to the doctor with a lump and he says, 
"We'll watch it." What do you mean, "We'll watch it?" We're telling women, "Say 
'Goodby, my brother' and find another doctor." He'll be gone off making his 
money and you'll be dead with children who have to go to foster homes because 
the doctor said, "We'll watch it." 
</P>
<P>
 We're telling women that a mammogram isn't good enough. You have to follow up. 
But there are so many problems. What do you do if you're a woman with no health 
insurance? They think, "Maybe it will go away if I just forget about it." The 
biggest problem is fear. 
</P>
<P>
 We're always looking for people to do volunteer work. We also need a van to 
pick up women who have just had surgery and need a ride to our support groups. 
</P>
<P>
 I've had some real financial scares. I am just now getting my rent caught up. 
At one point, I was three months behind because my disability checks were 
coming late. I'm not a martyr but the quality of my life is greater now than it 
has ever been. A million dollars would make my life more comfortable but, 
because of this project, my life could not be any richer.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TODAY'S TOPIC; 
LONG-TERM SURVIVAL WITH BREAST CANCER IS A CULTURAL AS WELL AS MEDICAL ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When breast cancer is discovered early, a patient has a 93% chance of living 
at least five years, according to the latest figures from the American Cancer 
Society. Yet that statistic doesn't apply equally to all women. 
</P>
<P>
 When broken down by race, the data paint quite a different picture. Between 
1983 and 1989, for example, 81% of white women had a five-year rate of 
survival, regardless of when their breast cancer was discovered. That number 
dropped to 64% for African American women, according to American Cancer Society 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no known medical reason for the difference. Rather, economics, 
culture, language, even sexual orientation are proving to be just as much a 
barrier to overcoming breast cancer as anything found under a microscope. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many groups, this is partly due to a lack of information and lack of 
access to the health system," says Dr. Mercedes Brenneisen-Goode, an oncologist 
practicing in Los Angeles. "They don't have the money to spend to get a 
mammogram, they are more worried about day-to-day living." 
</P>
<P>
 Cultural barriers to getting timely medical treatment and the outside support 
that many believe is vital to recovery can be just as daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's Community Comment, support group pioneer P.J. Viviansayles talks 
about the frustration she felt as an African American who had nowhere to turn 
for support when the disease was diagnosed. She also discusses the social 
difficulties faced by African American women with breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical professionals are beginning to understand that treatment may need 
adjustments from one culture to another. "The first thing we learned was that 
the same approach wouldn't work" for all patients, says Dr. Dava Gerard, 
medical director of the Breast Health Center in Santa Ana. "Our slogans weren't 
reaching groups of underserved women," adds Gerard. 
</P>
<P>
 Some problems are specific for each culture. "For many of the Hispanics I see, 
it's not part of their culture to go to the doctor for prevention," says 
Brenneisen-Goode, who also practices in Glendale. "They wait until they're very 
sick and then they tend to go to local pharmacies for advice. Possibly, they 
feel a little shy to go to a doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 Two groups that often fall between the cracks are the physically disabled and 
lesbians. "Lesbians are more likely to develop breast cancer because they have 
many high risk factors, but they are uncomfortable dealing with a homophobic 
medical community," says Gerard. "And the physically disabled often have 
difficulty getting a wheelchair up to a mammogram machine." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerard says some barriers are universal. For instance, women without a family 
history of the disease often wrongly believe they are safe from breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The cultural problems surrounding breast cancer are real, say these 
progressive physicians, and only by being acknowledged can they be overcome.

By BETZY MENDEZ, 15, raised in a home where domestic violence was common, ran 
away for the first time when she was 11. Alcohol and drugs have been constants 
in her life. But with the help of her mother and the staff at Phoenix House, a 
nonprofit residential high school in Lake View Terrace, Betzy has sought to 
shake her old life. She has undergone counseling aimed at developing 
self-esteem and setting goals for the future. She spoke with Times staff writer 
KEVIN BAXTER.

<TEXT>
<P>
 I've been drinking since I was small. The drugs probably came when I was 12. I 
wanted something more so I started smoking weed. Weed wasn't enough so I went 
to acid. One leads to another. 
</P>
<P>
 I was looking for escape. I was always running from my problems. And drugs 
were my partner, my best friend. 
</P>
<P>
 I grew up in a very violent house. People got hit for no reason at all. There 
was never any solution. 
</P>
<P>
 My parents separated when I was 9. I was very ashamed of it. I was left under 
my mom's custody but ran away (at age 11) because I wanted to be with my dad. I 
haven't stayed in the same place for more than about six months since then.  
</P>
<P>
 I got involved in a tagging crew. But tagging is just the way to start. Then 
you go to other kinds of parties and you find more and more drugs. I never 
bought drugs because all my friends used to love to give them to me. 
</P>
<P>
 I enjoyed the high. But that wasn't the main reason I took them. I just didn't 
know how to handle all that stuff (with my family). When you're high, you don't 
care. I forgot about how messed up my life was. 
</P>
<P>
 I would wear big old pants and big old long T-shirts. I got molested when I 
was smaller. I used to think that if I would show off my body, it was going to 
happen to me again. So I needed to hide.  
</P>
<P>
 I had to be dragged to the van that brought me here. But when I got here, I 
said I just might as well accept the fact that I was in here to change. What 
helped me most was the family I have here: Evelyn, Dolores, Michele, Monique 
and Ralph, (staff and friends at Phoenix House). They helped me grow, telling 
me, "You can do this, don't give up on yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a whole different person. I have goals. I want to graduate high school. 
Before, I didn't know what school was. I want to enlist in the Marines. I want 
to go to law school, be a defense lawyer. I want to have a family. I want to 
become rich. 
</P>
<P>
 I know how to handle things now. On my last home pass, my mom was arguing with 
my little brother and I said, "Why don't you guys just talk about it? Have you 
ever tried that?" My mom didn't know how to deal with that. She burst out in 
tears and so did my brother. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm very confident and feel good about myself. I don't think I'm the best, but 
I'm the best that I can be right now.  
</P>
<P>
 We have a concept here that you can't keep it unless you give it away. I've 
been given the life change but I can't just keep it, I need to give it to young 
girls in the program, to my friends out there who are having problems. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't want to forget where I came from. My old friends are crying for help 
but they don't know how to get it. I write to them, giving them advice. But I 
don't plan on being around those people anymore. I'm planning to keep myself 
busy and stay away from that stuff.

LITTLE SAIGON: 'A TOUR OF ASIA WITHOUT AIR FARE'

 Orange County's Vietnamese have come to the United States in waves since the 
fall of Saigon in 1975. Many settled in Little Saigon, which has become a focal 
point for the more than 130,000 Vietnamese in Southern California. Starting 
with a single market in 1978, the district grew along Bolsa Avenue in 
Westminster, where rents were low. It now has 1,800 mostly family-owned 
businesses, ranging from herbal pharmacies to French-style cafes. Recently 
approved design guidelines aim to ensure that new construction reinforces the 
area's ethnic identity. FRANK JAO 
</P>
<P>
 Developer, Westminster, came to this country in 1975 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980 I converted an industrial park into an Asian shopping center. To make 
a statement that this was an Asian center, we put in a Chinese-style pagoda 
gate. Shopping centers today should have cultural elements. 
</P>
<P>
 The culture of Vietnam has always been mixed. Chinese culture and institutions 
have been very well blended into Vietnamese culture for thousands of years. 
Then came the French influence in the 1900s followed by American culture in 
recent years. In Little Saigon there are a majority of Vietnamese and Chinese 
but we also find people from Cambodia, Laos and even Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Saigon is a quick tour to Asia without having to spend 18 hours on the 
airplane and $2,000 for the air fare. HIEU PHAN 
</P>
<P>
 Architect, Westminster, came to this country in 1971 
</P>
<P>
 Masses of Vietnamese people come down Saturday or Sunday to seek each other 
for comfort and support. People need a place to hang out or just watch people. 
</P>
<P>
 If you drive through Little Saigon, you see a lot of nondescript buildings. 
When you think about an Oriental country, you see a certain image, a glazed 
tile curved roof which is pretty much the trademark of Asian architecture. The 
city of Westminster realized something must be done in Little Saigon to reflect 
its character. They created the design guidelines, which I think are an 
excellent idea to create an identity. The guidelines allow two styles, Asian 
and French Colonial, that are very popular in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years from now, it will have made a difference. The area has potential to 
become a tourist attraction as it is just a few miles from Knott's Berry Farm 
and Disneyland.

By LUKE MAGEE has been a Los Angeles police officer since Feb. 26, 1990. After 
spending more than six years in the Marines, Magee, who grew up in Los Angeles 
and graduated from Dorsey High School, entered college and decided to follow 
his old dream of becoming a cop for the department that he says he'd always 
thought of as the best. But the LAPD now finds itself losing nearly 100 sworn 
personnel a year through pre-retirement resignation; as many as two-thirds of 
those who resign move to smaller but better-paid departments. Magee talked with 
JAMES BLAIR about the factors he's weighing on whether to stay on or leave the 
department. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Yes, I'm thinking of leaving. Twelve classmates who I went through the academy 
with have left to go to other agencies. Some of it has to do with pay -- I 
stopped showing my wife recruitment fliers from other (police) agencies because 
she sees how much more they're paid. I hear the stuff going on with the City 
Council and the chief and it scares me -- makes me wonder whether it's time to 
get out of here. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the question of litigation exposure. With the LAPD you get involved 
with a shooting and you have people who are going to bring up past shootings 
that were questionable or even bad -- make this direct linkage between the past 
and the LAPD today. To be held accountable for 30 years of the department's 
history, that's a burden no police officer can work under. It's not fair to 
keep beating people with the past when these aren't the same officers. It's not 
the same department. It's almost half minority -- women and people of color. 
</P>
<P>
 I grew up in South Central. I hate using the term because it's become a kind 
of media shorthand for "bad neighborhood". That's not what I see. Crime has 
become democratic. There are areas in L.A. that have problems that need to be 
addressed but they're not "bad areas" because there are good people in them and 
I understand their pain. I'm not some cowboy from the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Post-academy training is important. I do a lot on my own -- an officer's 
safety course, a week in Arizona at a shooting course. Other agencies allow 
their officers to do some of that as training days or reimburse them for part 
of it. Every time you see what's called a "bad shooting" -- that's lack of 
training. No one's out there wanting to shoot someone; but we get scared just 
like anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing is a big issue. It's ironic that here we are two, three months after 
the ACLU released its report talking about police officers living out of town 
and for the last year my wife and I have have been looking for a house. A lot 
of officers would love to live in the city; they just can't afford it. On the 
Westside, a house is $279,000 and even though I'm a veteran I couldn't afford 
that. Atlantic City, N. J., funded a program offering low-interest loans for 
officers living in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 There are people in the City Council who are very supportive but sometimes 
comments coming out of city government hurt. We work for them. We want to be 
the best. Most officers have a sense of fair play. The Christopher Commission 
had a lot of good things in it, but the implementation should be based on 
education, not just on negatives. The very cultural diversity they want, 
they're losing. A number of my classmates who left were female and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The tangibles are much greater at other departments. The intangibles are 
greater here. There is a lot of opportunity and I've been very fortunate in 
that regard. But the thing that keeps officers at the LAPD is the pride in the 
people they work with and the pride in the badge they wear. People have to be 
careful when they attack officers' pride. You can start pushing people to 
"think mercenary" and you don't want to make officers think of the bottom line 
(in) dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Give us a mission and if there's a problem give us your ideas how to fix it. 
But just to keep beating up on us -- that's where people say, "Forget it, I'm 
leaving."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: GETTING ANSWERS; HOW 
CAN I GET RID OF UNWANTED PHONE BOOKS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CRAIG BUCK, Sherman Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 If someone chucks a beer can on my front lawn, it's considered littering. What 
makes dumping unwanted phone directories any different? 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell Directory recently dumped 40 pounds of hard-to-recycle trash on 
my doorstep. Well, it was actually 32 pounds because of the 10 phone books 
delivered, I can use two. 
</P>
<P>
 We live in an age of diminishing space. A 1989 University of Arizona study of 
16,000 pounds of trash from landfills nationwide cited phone books as the 
greatest offenders. Yet the City of Los Angeles does not collect phone books. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Pacific Bell and a growing number of private directory companies 
distribute phone books without solicitation, often -- as in my case -- way out 
of proportion to a customer's needs. One problem is the belief that each phone 
line needs its own phone book or two. Yet it's common to have a separate line 
for the kids, another for business and maybe even separate lines for fax 
machines and modems. In my house, we have five phone lines yet need only one 
set of phone books. 
</P>
<P>
 Would it be so difficult for the phone company to put a computer-readable 
questionnaire on our bills for us to indicate how many phone books we need? Or 
for private firms to call before dumping their phone books on our property? 
This would not only reduce municipal waste, but would save trees, conserve 
energy and cut pollutants now emitted by producing and hauling hundreds of 
thousands of extraneous phone books every year. Presumably, these lower costs 
would translate to lower phone bills as well. What They Said: 
</P>
<P>
 ROLAND SILVA 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesman, City of Los Angeles recycling division 
</P>
<P>
 Phone books are not part of our recycling effort because there is no end 
market for them. If we'd collect them, we'd end up with a backlog because there 
really isn't any place to unload them. With other recyclables, we contract with 
those who can reprocess the materials. But phone books are already at the end 
of their life cycle so it has to be a phone industry effort. We refer callers 
to phone company services. 
</P>
<P>
 NANCY SWASEY 
</P>
<P>
 Media relations manager, Pacific Bell Directory, San Francisco 
</P>
<P>
 We deliver up to 4 million directories in Southern California, including 
Spanish books. We try to coordinate recycling efforts with various cities and 
recyclers at the same time books are delivered. This usually consists of 
month-long drives where customers can drop off old books at specific locations. 
There is also a number on the bottom front cover, (800) 953-4400, that details 
statewide recycling efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, we recycle an average of 15% of books in the greater Los Angeles 
area. This compares to about 50% in San Francisco, where they have curbside 
(phone book) recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't have computerized services for changing the number of directories 
that people receive yet. We are making calls to some customers to see what 
their needs are. People can also call our resource center at (800) 848-8000 to 
order more or fewer books.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD; 
LITTLE TOKYO: A LIBRARY HAS FRIENDS WITH MUSCLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California public libraries are taking a budget beating -- losing staff hours, 
subscriptions and book-purchase funds. But some are holding their own and in 
Los Angeles' Little Tokyo, residents are even getting a brand new branch 
library, thanks to its Friends of Libraries group. Statewide, more than 600 
Friends of Libraries groups, perhaps best known for holding bargain book sales, 
provide thousands of dollars in welcome relief. While their fund-raising, 
promotional and volunteer work is no substitute for sustained public funding, a 
Friends' group can be instrumental in maintaining and even expanding a 
community's library services. The 12-year effort of the Friends' group in the 
Little Tokyo neighborhood is a case in point. WHAT FRIENDS DO  
</P>
<P>
 Generate donations of books, CDs and videos for resale at bargain sales. Use 
money raised to purchase items from wish list submitted by library staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Find sponsors for materials and equipment from local businesses and community 
members. Where possible arrange gifts of money with no strings attached. 
Purchase magazine or newspaper subscriptions for several years. Seek out such 
items as chairs, computers, carpeting, office supplies and plants as they're 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring political pressure. Write to city council, county board of supervisors 
and the state Legislature to tell them why a library is important in your 
community. Go to budget hearings and testify. Make appointments to visit 
officials and telephone them in their offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteer and organize volunteers to perform money-saving tasks. Keep books in 
order on the shelves. Help publicize library programs. Repair books. Assist 
library users at the computerized card catalog. FROM BOOKMOBILE TO BRICKS AND 
MORTAR 
</P>
<P>
 1977 Library service in Little Tokyo is limited to a weekly bookmobile visit. 
Community members form Friends of the Little Tokyo Public Library Services to 
support and increase service to the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 1982-'88 Friends group begins a sustained campaign to establish a permanent 
branch library in Little Tokyo. They write to and meet with local officials, 
city council members and library commissioners. They canvass door-to-door to 
expand membership and generate community commitment to a local library branch. 
</P>
<P>
 1988 The Friend's Group wins agreement from the city library to establish a 
branch library in Little Tokyo on a trial basis for three years to determine if 
the community has the demand for a permanent facility. 
</P>
<P>
 1989 Experimental branch library opens with more than $35,000 of shelving, 
furniture and equipment purchased by the Friends group with accumulated 
donations and book-sale proceeds. Little Tokyo's Centenary United Methodist 
Church provides 2,400 square feet of rent-free temporary space. 
</P>
<P>
 1992 City library commissioners designate the Little Tokyo Branch Library as a 
permanent branch library and ask the city librarian to work with the Friends 
group to find it a permanent home. 
</P>
<P>
 1994 City Council authorizes leasing 5,000 square feet of space in the 
historic Neptune Building for the Little Tokyo Branch Library. Construction is 
expected to be completed early next year. Measuring the Need 
</P>
<P>
 Little Tokyo received a new branch library after easily surpassing circulation 
requirements set by the Los Angeles Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
 1989-90 
</P>
<P>
 Minimum benchmark: 30,000 
</P>
<P>
 Actual circulation: 74,328 
</P>
<P>
 1990-91 
</P>
<P>
 Minimum: 50,000 
</P>
<P>
 Actual: 100,879 THE SECRET TO SUCCESS 
</P>
<P>
 Marion Kadomatsu, chairperson of the Friends Committee for Library Expansion 
and member of the Friends group since 1982, credits perseverance for the 
library's creation: 
</P>
<P>
 "When we began, we didn't know anyone who was influential or who had any 
money. Our organizing and fund-raising initially was from the grassroots -- 
from ordinary people in the community. Today we have some corporate donations, 
but we still don't have the financial resources that many groups have. If 
you're committed and you don't give up, you can reach your goal."

MIKE PENNER: WRONG-WAY RAMS GO AWRY AT WORST TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Second and goal at the two? Damn," Jackie Slater muttered as he tugged at a 
final piece of ankle tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hear that, Jones?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Wha' happened?" Clarence Jones said, snapping to attention in front of his 
locker as if he'd been roused from a deep sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had second and goal from the two," Slater repeated, shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
 And, briefly, technically, it was. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also second and goal from the 12, after Wayne Gandy was called for 
holding, and second and goal from the 17 after Slater was flagged for a false 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 As for a false finish, the Rams were working on that too. Completing their 
soon-to-be-published primer, "How Not To Conduct Oneself When Inside The Red 
Zone," the Rams took their shot from the 17, had Chris Miller throw a pass one 
way, had Flipper Anderson break the other and watched Green Bay cornerback 
Lenny McGill all but fair catch the ball in the back left corner of the end 
zone with 47 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the scintillating comebacks and thrilling goal-line climaxes Lambeau 
Field has witnessed throughout its illustrious history, this wasn't one of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember Bart Starr sneaking into the end zone behind the block of Jerry 
Kramer? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, now the hearty sons and daughters of Green Bay will also remember Jerome 
Bettis sweeping left behind the jersey-grab of Wayne Gandy . . . and Chris 
Miller dropping to pass behind the offside jump of Jackie Slater . . . and 
Flipper Anderson improvising a curl route behind the fade pattern Miller threw 
to Lenny McGill. 
</P>
<P>
 Years from now, they will tell their children, and their children will tell 
their children, and hearts will warm anew at the recollection of a great Packer 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 This one was 24-17 after the Packers trailed, 17-3. That's 21 unanswered 
points for those scoring at home. Not only did the Rams fall on their faces 
attempting to rally in the final minute, they also fell on their fannies 
attempting to sit on a two-touchdown lead in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Rams, it was an equal-opportunity disaster, with the usually reliable 
kick-coverage unit breaking down at the worst possible moment (game-tying, 
85-yard punt return by Robert Brooks); the always reliable Sean Landeta 
breaking down at the worst possible moment (13-yard shanked punt, setting up 
game-winning touchdown); and the never reliable offense breaking down all over 
the field in the second half, unable to produce a first down for five 
possessions and 22 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 But all transgressions would have been forgiven and forgotten had the Rams 
been able to handle second and goal at the Green Bay two better than a 
snowmobile locked in reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 The going was dubious from the start, from the first play sent in from the 
sideline: Pitch back to Bettis and sweep left, a play that hadn't done much 
more than leave divots all afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, the Rams' left offensive tackle, said the Packers "were waiting for the 
pitch. They knew it was coming. They were yelling, 'Pitch! Pitch!' as we're 
walking up to the line." 
</P>
<P>
 But, hey, it worked here with Jim Taylor, right? Must be the thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers buried Bettis behind the line of scrimmage. However, away from the 
ball, Gandy, the rookie right tackle, was holding Packer middle linebacker Fred 
Strickland, even if he denied it to the bitter end. 
</P>
<P>
 "He tripped over me and we both fell on our backs," Gandy said. "I didn't even 
know who it was called on until I got to the sideline. I argued about it -- the 
guy fell over me. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, it was too late." 
</P>
<P>
 Slater replaced Gandy and soon it was Packer colors -- yellow on green, 
penalty flag on the grass -- once again. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mistake," Slater conceded. "I was dealing with one of the premier 
defensive ends in the game (Reggie White) and he was bringing it. I made some 
mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a play going there, but my timing was off a little." 
</P>
<P>
 Two penalties, 15 yards, second and goal again, now from the 17. 
</P>
<P>
 In the huddle, Miller called the play. "A '9,' " Miller said. "Four receivers, 
four '9s', four 'gos.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson went and ran a figure-8, or whatever, instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called one route," Miller said, "and we got something else." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Miller wanted to point any fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to point any fingers at him," Miller said. "I'll just say it was 
miscommunication. . . . It was just a lack of execution, and it killed us." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, cornered at his locker stall, quietly pleaded no contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was supposed to run a deep route," Anderson explained, "but their 
cornerback was fading back there. I misread it. In the heat of the moment, 
those things happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Troy Drayton, the tight end who scored two touchdowns for the Rams Sunday but 
was sitting this play out, said, "the wide receiver has an option to ad-lib 
there. If he sees the defense in a different coverage, he can change his route, 
to take the option that gives us the best advantage. But the quarterback and 
the wide receiver have to be on the same page." 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, Miller and Anderson weren't in the same bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this case," Drayton said, "it was fatal for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Suffice it to say, Lombardi never played it this way. His teams tended to move 
toward the goal line, not away from it, and pandemonium in the end zone was 
something that happened after the game, not during it. But football was simpler 
then.

MIKE DOWNEY: THE REAL TEAM STOOD UP BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 See how fast things can turn around? The Raiders are on the road to wellville. 
They are now only one game out of second place -- with 11 whole weeks left in 
the season. Welcome back to the party, boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry McDaniel and the pirates had a big day Sunday, throwing themselves a 
little tea party outside Boston. McDaniel intercepted three Patriot passes, or 
missiles if you must, in making a delightful nuisance of himself for the 
Raiders in their 21-17 success. And oh, did these guys ever need this kind of 
game now. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing harder on the road than they did at home, same as they did at Denver, 
these looked more like the real Raiders, the ones who sure have been taking 
their sweet time showing up. While it was hardly Jeff Hostetler's best day, the 
defense did a number on New England's Drew Bledsoe, with newcomer Jerry Ball 
playing good ball and newer-comer Rob Fredrickson playing even better. 
</P>
<P>
 For portions of the last two games, whenever the Raiders needed a clutch 
tackle, on special teams or in the waning minutes, the rookie Fredrickson 
stepped forward to make it. Check the film. Sunday's game marked the first 
start for the first-round draft choice, and you might not see him out of the 
Raider lineup for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 It took strong plays like his and Ball's and McDaniel's to make up for the 
usual assortment of Raider "what were you thinking?" mental mistakes, like guys 
lining up offside or forgetting to catch kickoffs or hurtling themselves 
illegally in bids to block New England field-goal attempts like circus people 
shot out of a cannon. At one point, Andrew Glover sprang into the sky and came 
down somewhere in the suburbs of Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
 For a change, the Raiders got away with stuff like this. 
</P>
<P>
 In this, a contest involving two rushing attacks that would require three 
downs to get three yards and a cloud of dust, at least the Raiders did utilize 
running back Harvey Williams with a heads-up play, a dump pass from Hostetler 
that the swift Williams turned into a touchdown. Nobody laid a finger on him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, the Raider offensive coordinator still needs a missing-persons bureau 
or Angela Lansbury or some detective to investigate whatever became of Tom 
Rathman and James Jett. But at least the squad as a whole came together, and 
can spend the next few days speaking optimistically about being in Miami next 
week. After all, the Dolphins did look like guppies in their game with Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 About time something went right for the Raiders. They were overdue to do 
something right. Analysts theorized that Bledsoe would shred them, but every 
time the Patriot quarterback threw a ball, McDaniel stepped in front of it. 
Bledsoe was so rattled that on his final throw of the day, the only man open 
was James Trapp of the Raiders, so Bledsoe hurled it to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Trapp will have to take a ribbing this week when the film of him dropping the 
ball is shown at practice. Bledsoe's pass came right to him. Trapp could have 
walked to the end zone on his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. Nobody in camp will have to hide his face this week, the way so 
many Raiders must have felt like doing over the last month. For four games, the 
Raiders were so terrible, they couldn't even blame it on the media. A few felt 
like crawling into holes. Nolan Harrison said the team's play was making him 
sick to his stomach. Winston Moss said he preferred not to use the word 
"underachieving," but he sure felt like it. 
</P>
<P>
 All the frustration the players were feeling was obvious from the face and 
voice of Tim Brown toward the end of Sunday's game, when the wide receiver 
gestured heatedly toward his own sideline after a conservative rushing play on 
second and long. Either Brown was upset by the strategy or he caught somebody 
stealing his favorite towel. 
</P>
<P>
 But the unlucky Raiders did get the breaks they so badly needed, including a 
chippy offensive interference call against New England's tight end. That one 
must have made Eddie Anderson and Lionel Washington laugh, considering the bad 
calls that went against them in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was Hostetler, who finally got a roughing-the-passer rap 
called, without anybody having to knock him unconscious. Only two weeks ago, 
the Raider quarterback blurted out that he hadn't gotten a roughing penalty all 
last season and probably wouldn't get one this season "unless I was wearing a 
different number" -- one he wouldn't specify but one we suppose might be, oh, a 
7 (Mr. Elway) or a 16 (Mr. Montana) or a 12 (Mr. Kelly), hmmm? That what you 
mean, Hoss? 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler took one hit Sunday that would have knocked out a Jeep. He got up. 
Then he took another one, an arm to the helmet, that hardly fazed him in the 
least, but was illegal as could be. And he actually got a call. Credit new 
strides in NFL officiating, or Hostetler's power of suggestion, or maybe only 
that the Raiders' bad luck had to end sometime.

LEBOW, 62, DIES; GURU OF RUNNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fred Lebow, a pioneer in the running boom of the 1970s who built the New York 
City Marathon from a run in the park to a citywide event watched by millions, 
died Sunday after a second bout with brain cancer. He was 62. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebow, who died at his Manhattan home, had been treated as an outpatient at 
Memorial Sloan-Kettering. He was first diagnosed with brain cancer in 1990; the 
next year, he underwent surgery for thyroid cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, he was told he had six months to live. But he rallied, the 
disease went into remission and he completed the 1992 New York City Marathon to 
the cheers of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm the healthiest cancer patient they've ever had," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cancer recurred this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "In running, it doesn't matter whether you come in first, in the middle of the 
pack or last," he said. "You can say, 'I have finished.' There is a lot of 
satisfaction in that." 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Steinfeld, president of the New York Road Runners Club, said a tribute 
will be held at the marathon finish line in Central Park on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He said staff, board members, sponsors, city officials and volunteers will 
join hands and cross the finish line together in a "symbolic promise to carry 
on Fred's dream, the five-borough New York City Marathon, far into the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The 25th New York City Marathon will be Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are prepared and committed to continue the rich legacy of Fred's ideals, 
promoting health, fitness, competition and community service," Steinfeld said. 
"Fred has left a grand heritage, and we will honor his memory by promoting his 
goals and realizing his visions." 
</P>
<P>
 Lebow first started running to improve his stamina for tennis. The love of 
tennis eventually gave way to the love of running. 
</P>
<P>
 He founded the New York City Marathon in 1970. The first race, a four-loop 
circuit around Central Park, attracted only 127 runners. Lebow placed 45th out 
of the 55 finishers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Fleming, who won the race in 1973 and 1975, said Lebow persisted in his 
bid for a five-borough event, and city officials finally relented. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a hard thing to convince the city to do, but his talent basically was 
that he could always convince people to do what was best for running," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the race attracts more than 25,000 runners, and many thousands more are 
turned away.

NHL PLAYERS' NEW PROPOSAL MIGHT SPUR RETURN TO ICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The contents of a proposal to be presented to the NHL by the players' 
association today in Toronto will largely determine whether the season will 
start Saturday or will be postponed again, to Nov. 1 or later. 
</P>
<P>
 A source on the players' side of the contract dispute said Sunday that calling 
the plan significantly different from previous versions "would be an excellent 
way of describing it." 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman -- who has said he would have to 
see "meaningful" movement before allowing the season to start -- might declare 
enough progress has been made. When he meets with the league's Board of 
Governors on Tuesday in New York, he could accept a no-strike, no-lockout 
pledge the union made Sept. 29 and get backing for a Saturday start. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a league source said the new offering won't differ greatly from its 
last proposal. That plan centered on subsidizing small-market clubs with a fund 
created by a levy of 5.5% on the gate receipts and payrolls of the 16 
top-revenue clubs. The league rejected that as inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plan isn't much different, the governors will reject it and delay the 
season openers again. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Goodenow, executive director of the NHLPA, has been working on his plan 
since Wednesday, when he rejected two NHL proposals. Those addressed the 
small-market problem by imposing a 3% levy on the gate receipts of the top 16 
revenue clubs and a gradual levy on payrolls of a half-percent per million 
dollars up to $14 million and after that, 5% for each $325,000. Players said 
that system would keep salaries low. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other key issues remain. The sides agree on most aspects of broadening 
free agency, but they differ on salary arbitration. Players want it, but the 
NHL wants to abolish it.

RAM NOTEBOOK; LOSS OF GILBERT PROVES TO BE COSTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When defensive tackle Sean Gilbert went down with a bruised left shoulder on 
the second series of the Rams' 24-17 loss to Green Bay on Sunday, the Rams' 
pass rush went with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert, a Pro Bowl tackle and the key to the Rams' pass rush, missed practice 
all week with ankle and shoulder problems, and didn't even make it through the 
first quarter Sunday. He watched the second half from the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive tackle Jimmie Jones said the Rams couldn't recover from the loss of 
Gilbert. They produced only two sacks -- one by Joe Kelly on a linebacker blitz 
and another by defensive end Gerald Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Sean went down you have to be able to suck it up and keep applying 
pressure inside," Jones said. "Sometimes we did, but sometimes we didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "The momentum swung all the way, but we're supposed to be able to go out there 
and overcome something like that. And we started to overcome it, but then 
different things went wrong in different situations." 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie free agent D'Marco Farr replaced Gilbert. Farr batted down a Brett 
Favre pass and finished with one tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add injuries: Center Bern Brostek re-sprained his right ankle with 50 seconds 
left in the third quarter and had to be helped off the field. Brostek had 
sprained both ankles in last week's 8-5 loss to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Left guard Tom Newberry replaced Brostek at center and allowed Chuck Belin, a 
former Wisconsin standout, to play the final quarter at left guard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last add, injuries: Ram quarterback Chris Chandler, who didn't practice all 
week because of a sprained left ankle, was inactive for Sunday's game and Jamie 
Martin was the No. 3 quarterback behind Chris Miller and Tommy Maddox. 
Chandler's ankle had improved late in the week and Ram Coach Chuck Knox on 
Friday didn't rule out using Chandler for Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong turn: Green Bay cornerback Lenny McGill claimed his innocence after he 
was called for pass interference while trying to cover Flipper Anderson. The 
penalty cost the Packers 39 yards and gave the Rams a first down at the Green 
Bay 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made some contact downfield," McGill said, "but it wasn't enough for pass 
interference." 
</P>
<P>
 McGill made up for the mistake later in the drive when he intercepted a Miller 
pass in the corner of the end zone. Miller threw it right to McGill when 
Anderson ran the wrong route, cutting to the inside instead of to the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have to worry about Flipper because George (Teague) gave me help on 
the inside route," McGill said. "I just watched Miller's eyes and read him. He 
threw it right to where he was looking." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The unforgiven: Favre was booed loudly by Packer fans after his wobbling pass 
was intercepted by Darryl Henley, setting up the Rams' first touchdown. Favre 
said the ball slipped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably won't sleep tonight thinking about that because I had him 
(receiver Robert Brooks) open," Favre said. 
</P>
<P>
 Was he upset by the boos? 
</P>
<P>
 "Just like the cheers, you kind of take it with a grain of salt," said Favre, 
who completed 25 of 41 passes for 222 yards, including an eight-yard touchdown 
pass to Sterling Sharpe in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure it won't be the last time I hear them too." Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Ram linebacker Joe Kelly's second-quarter sack was his first since 1989. . . . 
Cornerback Darryl Henley's interception, which set up the Rams' first 
touchdown, was his first since the last game of the 1992 season, against 
Atlanta.

TAGLIABUE: PLAN BORN IN L.A.; STADIUM: NFL COMMISSIONER SAYS TALKS ABOUT A NEW 
80,000 SEAT FACILITY BEGAN MORE THAN THREE MONTHS AGO; HE BLASTS CRITICS OF THE 
CONCEPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Sunday that several unidentified Los 
Angeles city and county officials initiated the discussions about building a 
new football stadium in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Tagliabue also criticized those who have publicly opposed the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are city fathers in Los Angeles who are quite positive about it," he 
said before the Raider-New England Patriot game. "We've had discussions going 
back three or four months with city and county officials in Los Angeles who 
were very open to this kind of idea. In fact, they raised it with us before we 
raised it with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about those who have questioned the idea of building a new stadium after 
$60 million in public funds was spent to rebuild the earthquake-ravaged 
Coliseum, Tagliabue said there was "a negative response from people who have a 
tradition of being negative. . . . I think it (the stadium) is a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to be negative for the rest of your life, you can be that way, 
but you'll never make much progress. If you want to be positive and innovative 
and work together in a partnership, then you can get things done." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said on Sunday night 
that she doesn't believe a new stadium is in anyone's best interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he (Tagliabue) has an opportunity to look at his plan, his idea of a new 
stadium will be different," Burke said. "There are a lot of places in Los 
Angeles talking about putting up a stadium, but 80,000 seats, there just is not 
a lot of use for that here." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the money already spent on the Coliseum, Tagliabue said: "They did 
it for their own reasons. They didn't do it because the National Football 
League asked them to do it. . . . I'm not arguing whether it was necessary to 
spend the money. I'm suggesting what we are putting on the table is an 
innovative concept that looks forward for 20 to 30 to 40 years, not just to 
repair the damage from an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Responded Burke: "We can make the Coliseum state of the art, but building a 
new (stadium), there isn't the money to build a new stadium." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the new stadium plan was being floated in the hope of keeping the 
Rams and Raiders in Southern California, Tagliabue said he is "not assuming the 
Rams are going to move." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Raiders, he said: "I think it's fairly clear they're looking at 
other alternatives. You don't have to be a genius to know they have problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Raider owner Al Davis, in attendance at Sunday's game, chose not to comment on 
Tagliabue's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Burke: "We hope the Raiders are going to stay, but if they aren't, then 
we'll talk, I imagine, with the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we should get into big battle and certainly not in the press. 
We're moving forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Under a plan first revealed by Tagliabue last week, a new stadium in Los 
Angeles would be partially financed from as yet unspecified sources of NFL 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the NFL plan, the stadium would be constructed along with a football 
theme park similar to the one installed next to the Rose Bowl for the Super 
Bowl two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke said plans already exist for a similar facility adjacent to the Coliseum 
in Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have had discussions with the NFL to get together," Burke said. "We will 
invite them to look at a new Exposition (Park) complex. There's a whole (new) 
Exposition planned. A new museum, the whole complex." 
</P>
<P>
 To entice the city of Los Angeles to take part in the venture, Tagliabue said 
the Super Bowl would be held there five times in the 10 years after the stadium 
was completed. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a need for a better stadium in Los Angeles," he said, "and we have the 
ability to link it to the Super Bowl because Los Angeles is such a great Super 
Bowl site if it can be done properly . . . If we play a Super Bowl in a city, 
it brings $150 million to $200 million to that city in a two-week period of 
time. If we played five Super Bowls in a city over a 10-year period, it would 
bring close to a billion dollars to that community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of a concept for putting forth a major boost to tourism in the 
local economy unprecedented in sports." 
</P>
<P>
 So where does that leave the Coliseum? 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a bunch of ifs with the Coliseum," Tagliabue said, "including 
whether they'll continue to make the type of investment in it that needs to be 
made." 
</P>

EXTRA EFFORT IS JUST THE NORM FOR GARDNER; WATER POLO: SAN CLEMENTE GOALKEEPER 
CONTINUES TO EXTEND HIS GAME TO THE NEXT LEVEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 And we thought Gabriel Gardner was already doing plenty for San Clemente High. 
</P>
<P>
 Already an All-Southern Section goalkeeper for the water polo team and an 
All-Southern Section outside hitter for the volleyball team, Gardner is 
planning on adding another sport. 
</P>
<P>
 The Triton basketball team needs a center? Gardner will give it a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 So, there he is working on his moves to the hoop and trying to regain his 
shooting touch between sessions in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's that looming decision. In the next month, Gardner will decide 
whether he will attend UCLA, USC, Pepperdine or Stanford on a volleyball 
scholarship. Last week he visited USC and Stanford, this week it's UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, wait a minute, isn't this still water polo season? 
</P>
<P>
 It is and San Clemente Coach Steve Yancey says Gardner has never played 
better, despite the extra demands on his time. San Clemente (12-1) is ranked 
No. 1 in Orange County and the Southern Section Division I, and Gardner is a 
big part of the reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very, very fortunate to have a kid like this come through our 
program," Yancey said. "He makes the difference in a lot of games. Gabe tends 
to be the neutralizer." 
</P>
<P>
 The same 6-foot-9 wiry, athletic frame that draws the volleyball recruiters, 
serves Gardner in the pool. A three-year starter, he is easily the most 
physically imposing goalkeeper in the section, and Yancey says he reads 
offenses well, which helps him anticipate where the shots will come from. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner has given up only 56 goals this season, an average of four per game. 
The average drops to about three if you discount the 21 goals scored in two 
games by powerful Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense is a ton better when Gabe is playing well," Yancey said. "When we 
make a mistake and I'm ranting and raving on the bench because of it, they 
usually turn out to be nothing because Gabe is taking away the opportunity. Our 
kids can cheat to the offensive end because he is so good." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the season, Yancey was concerned that the recruiting process might 
hamper Gardner's senior water polo season. The competition is heating up. All 
the schools except Stanford are offering a full scholarship; Stanford's offer 
is a full scholarship the first year and 70% the next three. UCLA and 
Pepperdine coaches have said he could try to play water polo and volleyball if 
he chose to. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner is planning to sign a letter of intent during the early signing period 
in November, meaning he has had to miss some practices to take recruiting 
visits. That wasn't a problem -- Yancey is flexible -- but would Gardner's mind 
be elsewhere even when he was in the pool? 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the season, he answered the question to Yancey's satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the season, I said I would be happy if Gabe just played to the level 
he was at last year," Yancey said. "Then playing Riverside Poly in the second 
round of the South Coast tournament he immediately jumped ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I just hope all the pressure that's going to be on the kid -- which I 
have the utmost empathy for; he's going to make the most important decision of 
his life in the next month -- can come without a lot of tugging and pulling on 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner, who seems to be taking the situation in stride, said he never had any 
doubt that water polo would remain a priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it worked out better because we anticipated it," Gardner said. 
"Yancey was worried for a time that I wasn't going to be interested in water 
polo, but I'm not going to sit back and say, 'I did pretty good last year; I'll 
just sit back and do average again this year.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'll ever do that." 
</P>
<P>
 It's just not the way he was brought up. His father, Frank, who is a computer 
science and world history teacher at San Clemente, made sure of that. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Gardner was a three-time All-American swimmer at UC Irvine, helping the 
Anteaters to a NCAA Division II team title in 1971. His swimming coach, Ted 
Newland, still the water polo coach at Irvine, is legendary for grueling 
training techniques, and some of that philosophy apparently rubbed off. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriel Gardner says his first memories of swimming aren't pleasant. He and 
his older brother Phinney were about 7 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were crying and saying, 'Dad, please take us out. We don't want to do this 
anymore,' " Gardner said. "But he kept pushing us and told us that we wouldn't 
get any better if we kept getting in and out." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the brothers became two of the best age-group swimmers around. 
They also excelled at youth football, basketball and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think swimming was a building block for us," Gabriel Gardner said. "To this 
day (dad) reminds us of how hard we worked and how much pain we went through 
and how it paid off for us." 
</P>
<P>
 For Phinney, who was a water polo and basketball standout at San Clemente, it 
helped earned him a 70% water polo scholarship to California, where he is a 
redshirt this season. Two younger brothers, Zachary and Nicholas, in eighth and 
seventh grades, are waiting in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriel is hoping his extra effort will help the Triton water polo team win 
the section title. The last time San Clemente won, he was a freshman and got 
into the game with nine seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, you can be sure he'll be doing more.

BUGGED BY MALATHION; RESIDENTS, ACTIVISTS PLOT TO HALT IMPENDING AIR ASSAULT ON 
MEDFLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With just a few days to go, a handful of Camarillo residents plotted with 
anti-malathion activists Sunday to stop the coming rain of pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
 They tossed around ideas -- phone trees, lapel buttons, petitions, speeches, 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 And they vowed to do everything possible to disrupt the six-month, biweekly 
aerial-spraying plan, even if there is no hope of stopping the first helicopter 
flight Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm telling you, get out in the streets," exhorted Annie Waterman of Action 
Now, a group that fought malathion spraying programs in Los Angeles and 
Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "You guys need to fund-raise, you need to do garage sales, you need to 
consolidate your money to get a phone," Waterman urged the more than a dozen 
residents gathered Sunday afternoon in Crestview Park. "You need to be a 
headache to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Waterman also urged the group to make noise Tuesday night at Las Colinas 
School in Camarillo, where state and county agricultural officials have planned 
a meeting to explain the malathion program to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Since two pregnant Medflies were found two weeks ago in traps at St. John's 
Seminary in Camarillo, 61 more have been found -- one pregnant female and the 
rest males, said Carla Agar, spokeswoman for the California Department of Food 
and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows for sure how the flies came to Camarillo, she said. But DNA 
testing revealed the Camarillo flies are kin of Medflies found in Hawaii and 
Guatemala, she said -- and not related to flies found in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 And nothing anyone says or does at Tuesday's meeting, she added, can stop the 
malathion spraying program meant to kill them and save Ventura County's 
multimillion-dollar fruit industry, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the quiet before the storm," Agar said of the coming protests. "People 
can ask any kind of question they want. We're ready for all the protests, and 
we're ready to proceed. . . . The decision has been made." 
</P>
<P>
 At Sunday's shade-tree activists' meeting, though, some were already drawing 
battle lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to get in their face now and scream hell, bloody murder," said Tom 
Grundeman, a Camarillo resident who lives in the spray zone. "I think we're 
going to need people in groups to focus on things" such as phone work, 
distributing leaflets, fund-raising and event planning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Santa Ana winds persist, the spray could reach beyond the 16-square-mile 
spray zone, Waterman said, pointing to a 1993 report by the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 "This stuff will spread 12 miles in a 10-mile-per-hour wind," she said. "If 
the wind's over 10 miles per hour, they can't fly, but in a 5-mile-per-hour 
wind, it'll spread three miles" downwind, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, detectable amounts of the spray can reach as far as 
12 miles in 10-m.p.h. winds if released at heights of 500 feet, and as far as 
3.5 miles in 5-m.p.h. winds at 200 feet. Officials said the helicopters would 
fly at altitudes of 300 to 700 feet while spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 Some questioned why the Medflies cannot be stopped in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "This in itself does not necessitate spraying," said Leonard Mehlmauer. "There 
are other biological ways, proven ways . . . that are not dangerous to the 
public." 
</P>
<P>
 But Agar said the infestation is too advanced to be stopped by releasing 
sterile male Medflies. Female flies that mate with the sterile flies die 
without laying eggs, but the process could take four to six months, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very critical issue," Agar said. "We need to go in and forcefully 
eradicate immediately because of the economics involved in this area, and the 
fastest, most efficient proven method is aerial spraying." 
</P>
<P>
 The mix of 1.5 ounces malathion and 10 ounces of corn syrup that will be 
sprayed over every acre of the zone can corrode paint on automobiles, warned 
Elisabeth Brokaw, director of the Ventura County Fruit Fly Action Cooperative 
Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 The group will be giving away 9-by-12-foot plastic car covers, from noon to 
7:30 p.m., at five locations on Tuesday and Wednesday to residents in the spray 
zone who cannot park their cars under cover, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The covers will be available at: Faith Baptist Church, 3300 West St., Somis; 
Mission Oaks Park, 5501 Mission Oaks Blvd., Camarillo; Pleasant Valley Pool 
Park, 1030 Temple Ave., Camarillo; Bill Esty Center, 3701 E. Las Posas Road, 
Camarillo; Leisure Village.

$50 MILLION IN SCHOOL FUNDS THREATENED BY PROP. 187; EDUCATION: OFFICIALS SAY 
THE COUNTY COULD LOSE STATE AND FEDERAL MONEY AND BE BURDENED WITH $6.5 MILLION 
IN NEW COSTS. BUT BACKERS SAY MEASURE WOULD GENERATE HUGE SAVINGS. 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura County schools stand to lose nearly $50 million in state and federal 
money if voters approve a November ballot measure that would deny public 
education to illegal immigrants, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 would also force local districts to spend an estimated $6.5 
million on new administrative duties: verifying the immigration status of 
children and their parents and holding hearings for students suspected of being 
in the United States illegally, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What may have started out as a way to stop illegal immigration ends up as a 
whole other massive bureaucracy," said Charles Weis, Ventura County 
superintendent of schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But local backers of Proposition 187 argue that overall savings from excluding 
illegal immigrant students would far outweigh the costs of implementing the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, supporters say, concerns about the ballot measure's financial impact 
ultimately miss the point. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue has nothing to do with money to schools, with money to health or 
money to welfare," said Steve Frank, coordinator for the county's Proposition 
187 campaign. "We can talk numbers. We can go over numbers. The bottom line is 
not numbers. It's whether or not you give a benefit to those who knowingly 
break the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 would bar illegal immigrants from public schooling, 
non-emergency health care and other social services in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal education officials say the measure violates federal privacy laws by 
requiring teachers and other school officials to verify the immigration status 
of students. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, U.S. Education Secretary Richard W. Riley has threatened to withhold 
federal funds from state school districts, including $26 million to Ventura 
County schools, if the ballot measure passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal money helps pay for free lunches for poor children, bilingual 
education for students who cannot speak English and special education for the 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 While some students who benefit from these programs are illegal immigrants, 
many are not, Weis said. "That's the sad thing about it. There's no relation 
between the kids who have these needs and the issue of immigration." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides stripping local school districts of federal funds, Proposition 187 
would also probably lead to the loss of millions of dollars in state money. 
</P>
<P>
 The state pays districts based on their quantity of pupils, so state money to 
districts would decline for each illegal immigrant student forced out of 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 State education officials estimate that 6% of California's students are 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Applying the 6% figure to Ventura County, which state officials said is a fair 
estimate, 7,140 of the county's 119,000 students are in the United States 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 At $3,200 per pupil, county schools would stand to lose roughly $22.8 million 
in state money. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer students should translate into lower costs, with districts able to hire 
a smaller cadre of teachers and spend less on supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 But some school districts would lose too few children to allow them to lay off 
teachers or otherwise cut costs enough to make up for the state funding cut, 
officials in Sacramento said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you lose one third-grader you can't save anything," said Jim Wilson, 
financial policy director for the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only would Proposition 187 cause districts to lose funding, it would force 
them to spend money checking the immigration status of students and parents, as 
well as holding hearings for suspected illegal immigrant children. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed law, school officials would initially have to check every 
student's immigration status and then conduct checks on all new children 
enrolling in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Just verifying the status of students and parents -- by checking birth 
certificates or other documents -- will cost roughly $25 per pupil, state 
officials estimate. Holding a hearing for each suspected illegal immigrant 
student would cost an additional $500, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly no district has extra money rolling around for these things. But 
these are unavoidable costs" under Proposition 187, said Wilson of the 
Education Department. 
</P>
<P>
 But Steve Frank disputed school officials' dim view of the initiative's 
financial impact. 
</P>
<P>
 He scoffed at the federal government's threat to withhold funds. "There will 
not be a cut," he said. "Bill Clinton is not going to cut money to California. 
. . . He wants to win the election." 
</P>
<P>
 And he said voters must look at the bigger picture when considering the 
projected costs of implementing 187. By forcing California's estimated 300,000 
illegal immigrant students out of school, the state would save at least $9.6 
billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets down to the fact that there will be more money for education for 
those who are legally here and those who abide by the law," Frank said. "This 
works out as a major plus." 
</P>
<P>
 But school officials say any money saved by Proposition 187 would come to 
local schools only if the state decided to boost its per-student spending. 
</P>
<P>
 And considering the state's tightfisted stance toward education in recent 
years, that possibility is "not likely," Conejo Valley schools trustee Mildred 
Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Lynch has sided with conservative residents on some school 
issues, including her battle against the California Learning Assessment System, 
or CLAS tests, and her support of last year's school voucher initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 But she is parting ways with conservatives who support Proposition 187. "I 
personally would not have any part of turning children away from schools or 
turning teachers into INS agents," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The argument is foolish to say we would get all this money if we turn 
children away from schools," Lynch added. "You still only get money for 
children that attend."

NOT JUST FUN AND GAMES; NIGHT SPORTS AT LA COLONIA GYM KEEP KIDS ON COURT, OFF 
STREETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The inviting lights of Oxnard's La Colonia Gym have become a beacon on Friday 
nights for bored teen-agers and reluctant tough guys searching for something -- 
anything -- to get them off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The gym, located on Marquita Street, has opened its doors on Fridays from 9 
p.m. to midnight, hosting basketball and volleyball matches, hoping to attract 
idle young people and give them a chance to sidestep mischief. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 to 50 teen-agers now spend Friday Night at the Gym, as the program is 
called, every week. Most say they have nowhere else to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wants to go out in the Colonia at night," said Rey Reyes, a volleyball 
coach at Hueneme High School who volunteers his Friday nights to the program. 
"They would rather come and shoot some baskets than get in trouble. They come 
here, wear themselves out and go (home) to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 The 26-year-old Reyes has spent the last month talking other Oxnard schools 
into starting similar late-night recreation programs. So far, Hueneme High has 
agreed to open its gym, and Santa Clara High School is considering a 
Friday-night program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like kids to have an opportunity, an option, a chance," Reyes said. "A lot 
of us had that opportunity, but a lot of kids don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, as loudspeakers blared "Bop Gun" from Parliament and other funky 
tunes, an equal mix of boys and girls played sports with youthful abandon at La 
Colonia Gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes initially tried to spin a Fleetwood Mac disc, and was nearly laughed out 
of the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised," he said. "There were a lot of complaints." 
</P>
<P>
 John Rodriguez, 19, said he stayed home a lot before the program began because 
it was not safe to do anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 "House parties are getting too dangerous," Rodriguez said, working on his 
pull-up jump shot just before midnight. "You can't go anymore. There are fights 
everywhere and guns getting blown out." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the gangbangers and hoodlums would never step foot in the gym, said 
Rodriguez, who believes it is futile to try to attract them to the program. But 
at least other young people have a place to go to escape the gangs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Friday was his day off, Oxnard Police Officer Ed Ludaescher was 
volunteering at the gym, lifting weights and playing pool with the boys. It is 
important for police officers to be seen as normal guys, Ludaescher said, not 
insensitive people who do nothing but arrest teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 The program helps cops deal with the frustration of watching good kids turn 
bad, said Ludaescher, who patrolled the Colonia before joining the Police 
Activities League. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of kids you see on the streets all the time on patrol," he 
said. "You see them grow up, and get into trouble, and you wonder, 'What else 
can I do?' By the time reality sets in for them, it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the youths are beyond redemption, Ludaescher said, but most are just 
followers who can be lured back to the right side of the law -- all they need 
is a place to gather, gossip, play sports or just watch others. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't for this place, most of these people would be out partying, 
getting drunk," said Marina Mendoza, 17, a senior at Channel Islands High 
School, sitting on the sidelines. "It's cool here, instead of being in the 
streets." 
</P>
<P>
 After a good skirmish, kids break to drink Gatorade, eat Oreos and play 
Ping-Pong, pool and Foosball at the adjacent Colonia Recreation Center, which 
opened at night for the first time Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before this we'd just hang out in the streets," said 17-year-old Victor 
Robledo, who dominated the Ping-Pong table Friday. "I'd rather be here than out 
in the streets, getting into trouble, robbing people and starting fights." 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes' sister, Nora, a former volleyball star at Pepperdine University in 
Malibu, was supposed to coach youths on how to slam, dig and spike across the 
volleyball net. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, brother and sister were schooling two eighth-graders on the 
basketball court. After a strong move in which she drove to the basket, stopped 
and easily popped a jump shot over their outstretched arms, one of the boys 
shook his head in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally I'm not that slow," Nora said after the game. "A lot of times guys 
don't want to play with girls, but it's different here." 
</P>
<P>
 Program participants are given fluorescent bands when they leave the gym so 
they will not be harassed by police for violating the 10 p.m. curfew. 
Organizers are also trying to lure kids back by promising them T-shirts for 
four straight visits. 
</P>
<P>
 After a rough, strenuous full-court game, 23-year-old Ramon Perez and his 
friends headed toward the drinking fountain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to play outside before this, under the lights, but it's much safer 
here," Perez said. "There's no violence here to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes and other volunteers say they worry about confrontations breaking out 
inside the gym. But they say that if the neighborhood's young people face such 
problems every day, organizers should be able to do it once a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a risk we have to take," Reyes said. "The people here, at least we 
know they're sober." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday Night at the Gym is sponsored by Oxnard's Recreation and Community 
Services Department and the Colonia Coalition on Alcohol and Other Drug Issues, 
a consortium of community activists and agencies. The program at La Colonia Gym 
is expected to cost the city $3,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition participants include the Oxnard Police Department, Ventura County 
Alcohol and Drug Programs, El Concilio del Condado de Ventura, the Oxnard 
Housing Authority and Friday Night Live, an anti-drug abuse group. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives us something to do," said 13-year-old Marie Martinez. "We won't be 
out there like vagos (vagrants) walking the streets."

YOUNGSTERS DEDICATE TIME CAPSULE AT ARTS PLAZA CEREMONY; THOUSAND OAKS: THE 61 
'GUARDIANS' VOW TO REASSEMBLE IN 20 YEARS TO OPEN THE PLASTIC TUBE. EVENT IS A 
PRELUDE TO CITY'S 30TH BIRTHDAY PARTY.

<P>
 Sixty-one guardians of a time capsule dedicated Sunday in front of the Civic 
Arts Plaza in Thousand Oaks headed straight for the refreshments as soon as the 
speeches ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Iced fruit punch and cookies awaited hundreds of people attending the outdoor 
ceremony as Mayor Alex Fiore dedicated the capsule that will be opened in 20 
years, on the 50th anniversary of the city's incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hot," said Ashlee Knight, a 10-year-old Girl Scout who pledged to return 
in two decades to oversee the capsule's opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures reached into the 90s under cloudless skies as residents deposited 
dozens of items that reflect life in Thousand Oaks in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 A program from the inaugural season of the Civic Arts Plaza, a local telephone 
book, a videotaped City Council meeting and dozens of other items will remain 
locked inside a sturdy plastic tube placed within a concrete bench along the 
wall of the newly opened performing arts center. 
</P>
<P>
 In 20 years, the 61 mostly 10-year-olds will reassemble to open that time 
capsule and begin another. The ceremony will be repeated on the occasions of 
the city's 75th and 100th birthdays, scheduled for the years 2039 and 2064. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will not be serving on the City Council when it comes time to open these," 
the mayor joked in his opening remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 The time capsule celebration Sunday was a prelude to the city's formal 30th 
birthday party, a black-tie event to follow the Oct. 21 grand opening of the 
Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks artist Denise Filz designed the gray concrete bench that will 
hold the time capsule as well as the 200-pound brass oak tree hanging above it. 
She spent months bringing the idea to fruition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted (the bench) to be something that could be used and be visible," she 
said. "Something for the kids to climb on. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we wanted something that would reflect the roots of our lives," Filz 
added. "Hopefully, enough of the guardians will come back in 20 years when they 
hand down the new guardianship." 
</P>
<P>
 Rob O'Neill, co-chair of the committee that organized the time capsule 
campaign, added to the tube a letter to the young people who will be on hand 
when it is opened in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "In it I tell them not to be disillusioned," O'Neill said. "You can take a 
voice and make a difference in your community." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill called the time capsule a portrait of the city, and predicted that in 
20 years the Civic Arts Plaza would still be a state-of-the-art facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really still in our youth" as a city, O'Neill said. "To blossom and 
grow into an antique is really a wonderful thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee co-chair also took a moment to relish the accomplishments of 
those who worked for years to open the arts plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long, hard struggle," he said. "We didn't know that we could ever 
get to this day." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten-year-old Christina Ballas said it was an honor to be selected as a 
guardian of the time capsule. She and five dozen other children submitted 
predictions for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be neat for our kids or somebody else's in 20 years when they open it," 
said Christina, a member of Girl Scout Troop 646. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably be gone," said Julie Zelman, another 10-year-old Girl Scout 
selected as a guardian. "But I'll remember to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake real estate agent Patty Woodard was one of more than 100 people to 
sign the six-foot plastic tube. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said to just put our names on there to leave room for everyone else," 
Woodard said after writing on the capsule with a thick felt-tip marker. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodard said she has looked forward to the Civic Arts Plaza opening since she 
first heard it was planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a much-needed facility," Woodard said. "It's something that will really 
add to the community and bring some culture to the Conejo Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Millie Sanabria, whose 10-year-old daughter, Vanessa, was among the 61 
guardians, said the time capsule would become part of the city's history. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm around in 20 years, I will be here to see what's changed," said 
Sanabria, an insurance agent who lives in Thousand Oaks. "But my daughter will 
definitely be here." 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Vanessa said she wasn't sure what she would be doing or where 
she would be living come 2014. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably be working, get married and have a child," she said. "But I'll 
be here, even if I live in Florida."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; ART CONTEST'S WINNING WORKS ON 
DISPLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 From soft watercolors to sculpted mobiles, the Thousand Oaks Community Gallery 
will be filled with 70 original works this month -- all winners in the city's 
annual art and photography contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really different from what you would normally see in a gallery," said 
Bonnie Roth, a member of the Thousand Oaks Arts Commission."It shows a lot of 
eclectic talent. We have sculptures made of everything from old machine parts 
to highly polished marble." 
</P>
<P>
 The art contest was billed as "Moments to Remember -- Celebrating Thousand 
Oaks' 30th Anniversary." But several of the winning entries strayed far from 
that theme. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas photographer David Hartung took the top award for photography with 
his images of people and street scenes in Hong Kong. Thousand Oaks artist 
Connie Tunick won "best of show" for fine art with her set of three watercolors 
titled "Transition," "Celebration" and "Passion." And Ventura artist Joanne 
Duby earned top billing for sculpture with her smooth marble works. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist who stuck closest to the theme, Gayle Simpson of Thousand Oaks, 
earned a special prize for capturing the city's history. Her striking collage 
titled "Jungleland -- Then & Now," places photographs of Thousand Oaks leaders 
in a circus setting, reminiscent of the old wild animal park. Mayor Alex Fiore, 
for example, is depicted as the elephant trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 All 70 works will be on display at the gallery, 2331-A Borchard Road in 
Newbury Park, through October. Gallery hours are 1 to 5 p.m. Thursday through 
Sunday. For more information, call Carol Williams in the city manager's office 
at 449-2128. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; CITY MAY SELL PLAQUES TO RAISE PARK FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trees and benches in Moorpark's public parks may soon sprout memorial plaques 
under a plan being proposed by the city's parks and recreation officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The commemorative plaques could be purchased by residents to honor friends or 
family members.Proceeds would help pay for the upkeep of trees in the city and 
supplement the parks and recreation budget. They will sell for a range of 
prices, but costs have not yet been set. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was proposed by City Councilman John Wozniak and Christine Adams, the 
director of Moorpark's Department of Community Services. "It would be nice to 
free up some of the city's general fund for other things," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams, who oversaw a similar program in the city of Buena Park, said Moorpark 
could include a list of items or special city events that residents could 
underwrite in the name of a loved one. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park published a gift catalogue in the mid-1980s that netted several 
thousand dollars from residents and local business that wanted their names or a 
friend's name on everything from fitness trails to park benches and trees, 
Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted it to go beyond just trees," she said. "(The program in Buena Park) 
generated a lot of interest from people, and it wasn't just for people who 
died. A lot of people did the dedications for birthdays and other things." 
</P>
<P>
 The council will consider the proposal at its Oct. 19 meeting. SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; COUNTY EXPECTED TO APPROVE CLINIC HEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County Medical Center physician Richard Ashby will be selected to 
operate the hospital's satellite clinic in Moorpark under an agreement being 
considered by supervisors Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors is expected to approve a $306,000 agreement to 
operate the facility at 6559 Princeton Ave., which is under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Health Care Agency operated a clinic on Front Street for a number 
of years before structural problems with the building forced its closure 
earlier this year, Ashby said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we closed, we were seeing upwards of 50 patients a week," he said. "But 
we expect that to be markedly increased with the larger facility and more 
physician providers." 
</P>
<P>
 Construction for the new building, a single-story office of about 2,000 square 
feet, was approved by the Board of Supervisors earlier this year. Ashby said 
the office would be open by late this year or early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The satellite facility will offer patients general health care services such 
as pediatrics, obstetrics and family medicine, he said. JEFF McDONALD

CULTURAL NIGHT TO BENEFIT ARMENIAN SISTER CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To raise money for Thousand Oaks' sister city, local performers will present 
an Armenian-American Cultural Night at 7:30 p.m. Sunday in the Civic Arts 
Plaza's Forum Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks' sister city, Spitak, is located about 60 miles northwest of 
Armenia's capital city of Yerevan.Residents there are still trying to rebuild 
after a devastating earthquake that struck the region nearly six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Thousand Oaks' Sister City Committee have visited Spitak and sent 
donations of money and humanitarian aid. Proceeds from Sunday's concert will 
help the residents of Spitak rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 Armenian-American performers include Arman Tigranyan, a 15-year-old violinist, 
and Salpi Kerkonian, a flutist who recently returned to her native Armenia to 
play with the Yerevan Philharmonic Orchestra. The program will open with a work 
by Albert Darakjian, a Westlake Village resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets are $25, or $100 for special seating. Call 449-ARTS or Lauren Balekian

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; COUNCIL TO VOTE ON NEW TRASH AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council will vote today on a proposal creating a new agency 
to decide what to do with the trash from western Ventura County after the 
Bailard Landfill closes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura would join with at least one other city to form the West County Waste 
Management Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The authority would contract for the disposal of solid waste and would also 
support recycling and waste reduction efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, the new authority would contract for services, such as 
shipping the trash out of the county, rather than opening and operating a new 
landfill. However, the authority would reserve the right to own and operate 
solid waste facilities if the agency's board of directors decided to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bailard Landfill outside Oxnard is the sole dump site in the western half 
of the county, but is set to close as early as the spring of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to put a landfill at Weldon Canyon, which lies between Ventura and 
Ojai, ran aground last year after opposition from the County Board of 
Supervisors. A ballot measure aimed at circumventing the board was declared 
illegal in August. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to the council urging support for the new agency, a city official 
said the solid waste industry is rapidly becoming more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Approving the authority would "position the west county to be a significant 
player in the emerging marketplace," said Steve Chase, assistant to the city 
manager for legislation and regional affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Creation of the authority was endorsed by the council's environment committee

'CURE' COULD KILL ORGANIC FARMS, SAY OPERATORS; AGRICULTURE: MALATHION CAMPAIGN 
WOULD VIOLATE THE GUARANTEE THAT THEIR PRODUCE IS GROWN WITHOUT CHEMICALS, TWO 
DECLARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Malathion will kill Medflies, no doubt. But it also will kill business for two 
organic farms inside the 16-square-mile spray zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The twice-weekly rain of pesticide on Paul Carpenter's place and John Wooten's 
tiny spread will violate the guarantee that their food is grown without 
chemicals, the two organic farmers said Sunday. The six-month spray program 
could even put them out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooten on Sunday strolled the soft earth of a 3.5-acre patch off Mesa Road 
where he has grown organic vegetables and fruit for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "My commitment to organic farming is not just a business, it's a way of life," 
he said, fingering fragrant sprigs of basil. "I feel these would be unsuitable 
for my clients and my organic status if they are sprayed. . . . I don't know 
how I'm going to eat, myself, because I eat from my own garden." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter, the owner of a 20-acre vegetable farm near Mission Oaks Boulevard, 
is even more blunt. "It's very possible I'll dry up and blow away," said 
Carpenter, who runs the farm with his wife, Mary. "How can you not have a 
paycheck for six months?" 
</P>
<P>
 Even worse, just one malathion spraying could ruin Carpenter's promise of 
growing organic produce, he said. State and federal guidelines require that 
farmland must be free of artificial pesticides and fertilizers for at least 
three years before farmers can declare the produce is organically grown, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wholesale profits from selling the tainted produce on the non-organic market 
would not be enough to support the farm, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're farming 1,000 acres, it's a different story," Carpenter said. 
Malathion "will take our organic status and throw it in the trash can. . . . 
The people that buy our stuff want organic produce." 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad, says the California Department of Food and Agriculture -- everything 
in the 16-square-mile spray zone must be spritzed with malathion to save the 
county's rich agricultural market. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have concern and sympathy for anybody who's in the spray zone," said Carla 
Agar, a spokeswoman for the department. "We have to take action based on what's 
in the best interest for the entire population. . . . We hope they'll 
understand, with any hardships they may endure, and be as reasonable as 
possible with us given the situation we're put in." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter said he is somewhat resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura County has a huge citrus and avocado industry they have to protect, 
and it's worth a lot of money to everybody in the county," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this pest has to be eradicated. I just wish they didn't have to 
eradicate me along with it," Carpenter said. "My basic concern is that the 
state and the county really didn't think about everybody before they started 
doing this. . . . They're not concerned about us. It just doesn't mean that 
much to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Wooten, however, was not taking it lying down. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, he attended a meeting of Camarillo residents who hope to gum up the 
works of the malathion movement, and offered to join in the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wednesday night's impending spraying has him stymied. 
</P>
<P>
 He had just bought six months worth of seeds and organic fertilizer when word 
of the Medfly infestation came, he said, and now he faces the possibility of 
shutting down for at least six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooten said he is thinking about switching to ornamental flowers, but he 
worries the spray could damage them as easily as it does car paint. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm virtually at wits' end," Wooten said. "Everyone's afraid of their car, 
they're not afraid of their health. They say, 'Oh, my car!' I say, 'Oh, your 
health! ' "

FOOTNOTES / JAMES BATES: A UNIQUE DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the stranger stories of the nation's savings and loan crisis is the 
extraordinary security put in place by Thomas Spiegel when he headed the 
now-defunct Columbia Savings & Loan in Beverly Hills during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1992, Spiegel was indicted for allegedly looting the S&L to support a 
luxury lifestyle, including spending thousands of dollars for an arsenal of 
weapons, such as Uzi submachine guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal thrift officials in a separate civil action said Spiegel designed what 
was to be a headquarters building with a bulletproof "survival chamber." 
Through it all, Spiegel, whose federal criminal trial is schedule to start next 
week, never publicly explained his security concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, newly filed court documents provide Spiegel's first public explanation, 
although a recent defeat in court is going to preclude him from raising it in 
his defense. 
</P>
<P>
 According to government court papers, Spiegel had been planning to argue he 
suffers from a "Children of the Holocaust" syndrome that prompted his concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel himself was born shortly after World War II ended. But his parents 
survived the Holocaust, with their first-born son dying at the Nazi 
concentration camp at Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel's lawyers planned to call as a witness Yael Danieli, a clinical 
psychologist who founded the Group Project on Holocaust Survivors and Their 
Children. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors objected, calling Spiegel's claim "a ploy to present emotionally 
charged evidence with no foundation or relevance in an improper and desperate 
attempt to engender sympathy from the jury." They successfully argued to have 
any Danieli testimony excluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel lawyer Richard Marmaro said that as a result of the judge's ruling, 
there are no plans to use the Holocaust defense in the trial. Will This Contest 
Go Flat? 
</P>
<P>
 For a company concerned about selling a product that tastes good, soda maker 
Barq's is seemingly unconcerned if people question the company's good taste. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, known for its root beer, plans to launch within two weeks a 
"Match the DNA Sweepstakes" contest, in which people scratch off game cards 
featuring pictures of DNA strands. 
</P>
<P>
 Barq's marketing Vice President Rick Hill conceded that the contest 
capitalizes on the publicity surrounding DNA blood tests in the murder trial of 
O.J. Simpson, but "beyond that, this doesn't involve O.J." Targeted are readers 
of the irreverent magazines Spy and Inside Edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most scratch-off contests, winners in this game get prizes when they 
fail to match. "Normally, if you're involved in a situation where your DNA is 
being compared to something else, it's usually not good news when you match," 
Hill explains. Must Be Due to Budget Cuts 
</P>
<P>
 The Internal Revenue Service's Problem Resolution Office needs to resolve a 
problem by getting copies of its codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills tax lawyer Alan Kirios says he cited a regulation to the IRS 
last week that he believes justifies a client's tax deduction the IRS is 
disputing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They called back and left a message asking me to fax them a copy of the code 
section," Kirios said.

STREET SMART / RICHARD SIMON AND CARL INGRAM: POLLUTERS BEWARE: SMOG SENTRIES 
WILL SOON BE MANNING THEIR POSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON and CARL INGRAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Remember the smog cops? You know, those uniformed officers who patrolled Los 
Angeles freeways in black-and-whites armed with a Polaroid instead of a gun to 
shoot pictures of polluting vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The camera-toting officers are long gone, but authorities have a new weapon in 
their decades-old fight against the dirtiest vehicles on the road. They will 
soon begin installing a high-tech device that records the exhaust emissions and 
license plates of cars as they whiz by on roadways throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 RoboCop has arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of the worst-polluting vehicles will be sent a notice requiring 
immediate smog inspection, instead of allowing the usual two years between 
checks. Failure to appear will result in a fine of $5 for each day's delay, up 
to $500. 
</P>
<P>
 "A very small number of cars, maybe 10%, emit more than half of the pollutants 
from cars," said Bill Kelly of the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
 The new smog-sniffing devices -- one manufacturer calls its sensor "Smog Dog" 
-- are the latest weapons in the war to clean the air of the nation's smoggiest 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 The uniformed smog cops -- employed by Los Angeles County from 1955 through 
the late '70s -- were eliminated shortly after passage of the tax-cutting 
Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the CHP deployed up to nine officers in Los Angeles County to 
ticket smoking vehicles. But that program was eliminated last year because of 
budget cuts. CHP officers still issue citations for smog violations, but only 
as part of their regular duties, and the number of tickets issued has dropped 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 The AQMD also operates a snitch line for reporting polluting cars -- 
1-800-CUT-SMOG, which logged 136,000 calls last year. The agency sends out a 
letter asking owners of offending vehicles to check their cars and warning that 
violators are subject to a $250 fine if caught. But less than half of those who 
receive warnings send back the voluntary responses advising that they have 
addressed the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But soon, barely noticeable sensors -- boxes that sit alongside the roadway 
and shoot an infrared beam through a tailpipe's emissions -- will begin showing 
up in a number of places. 
</P>
<P>
 The state agreed to use the sensors as part of a compromise with the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, which said California was not doing enough to 
meet clean air standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are still working out details, such as how many devices will be 
placed on freeway ramps and which freeways will be outfitted. There are no 
plans to stop motorists on the spot. Rather, owners of vehicles repeatedly 
detected by the sensors as high polluters would be identified by computer and 
sent letters ordering them in for smog inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of the worst-polluting vehicles who have low incomes will be eligible 
for public subsidies of up to $450 to help pay for repairs; owners of gross 
polluters, regardless of income, will be eligible for up to $800 from the state 
if they junk their vehicle and buy a cleaner-burning one. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Bureau of Automotive Repair also has been using the sensors in 
Sacramento to help develop a profile of the worst-polluting vehicles by model 
and year. Once identified, the vehicles will become candidates for intensified 
inspections between their regularly scheduled examinations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody agrees that the off-cycle random test is the missing link," said 
James Schoning, chief of the bureau, which operates the smog check program. 
</P>
<P>
 If the program works as proposed, 1.5 million, or 15% of the cars and light 
trucks in the regions with the dirtiest air, including Los Angeles, will 
undergo rigorous new inspections next year at test-only facilities. Other 
affected regions include the Inland Empire, Orange, San Diego and Ventura 
counties, Bakersfield, Fresno and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining 85% of motorists will go to traditional test-and-repair garages 
as they have for the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the AQMD will soon begin testing the sensors on Orange County 
freeway ramps. Los Angeles recently placed sensors on city streets to determine 
whether their use would disproportionately affect certain economic classes. The 
results are still being compiled. 
</P>
<P>
 The air pollution district's tests are designed to help determine whether it 
should allow companies to use the sensors in lieu of establishing ride-sharing 
programs. Companies would station the sensors at entrances to employee parking 
lots and help pay for repairs to the worst-polluting vehicles or contribute 
toward the purchase of cleaner cars. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say the sensors could help solve an ironic problem: Some solo 
commuters may be driving cleaner cars than car-poolers. 
</P>
<P>
 A researcher hired by the AQMD to test the sensors said the worst-polluting 
cars on the freeway are emitting as much as half a pound of carbon monoxide per 
mile -- or 100 times the legal limit. "If the car goes 1,000 miles per month, 
that's three tons per year," said Doug Lawson, a professor with the Desert 
Research Institute at the University of Nevada, Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 The AQMD also is considering allowing companies seeking to expand their 
operations to receive "smog credits" for helping remove smoking vehicles from 
the road. In the meantime, Unocal Corp. has on its own purchased more than 
9,000 older cars for $700 apiece since 1990. Company officials said the 
vehicles were sometimes emitting pollutants at 100 times the levels that new 
cars would. 
</P>
<P>
 California requires that vehicles pass a smog check every two years, but 
studies show that even after the tests, 30% or more of vehicles pump out 
disproportionate levels of smog-forming elements. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy polluters are not just old clunkers. "Any car, old or new, can be a 
gross emitter, if it is not running properly," said Michael Appleby, automotive 
engineer for the Automobile Club of Southern California.  
</P>
<P>
 Often motorists have no clue whether their car is polluting because excessive 
emissions can be invisible. 
</P>
<P>
 The sensors could augment the smog check program, "serving as a deterrent to 
tampering and an incentive to proper maintenance, since motorists won't be able 
to anticipate when their vehicle will be tested," says an AQMD report. 
</P>
<P>
 If you think the sensor is a step toward Big Brotherism, consider what is 
being considered for the 21st Century: equipping cars with transmitters that 
send out a signal to alert authorities when a vehicle is polluting.

ELECTIONS; LAWMAKERS RETURN WITH REGRETS, NEW HOPES; CONGRESS: VALLEY 
LEGISLATORS COME HOME FOR THE FALL CAMPAIGN SEASON AFTER A SESSION THEY SAY WAS 
MARRED BY PARTISAN BICKERING.

<P>
 San Fernando Valley lawmakers, eager to return home to take up their 
reelection campaigns in earnest, are leaving behind a legislative session they 
say was rife with spiteful partisan wrangling and missed opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), who has served in Washington for 20 
years, said, "This was probably the nastiest Congress I've seen since I've been 
in office." 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, this fall promises an unusually harsh election campaign for the 
Democrats, who expected at the outset of the session to return home with 
extensive legislative achievements. Instead, turmoil on Capitol Hill has 
prevented easy passage of many bills and fueled public perceptions of gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting on their accomplishments this session, Valley Democrats lauded 
passage of the $30-billion crime bill, but lamented the defeat of health care 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), serving his ninth term, said he 
was particularly proud of an amendment he co-authored to the crime bill that 
requires the federal government to reimburse states for part of the cost of 
incarcerating illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time, the federal government is owning up to the cost of our 
own failure to patrol our borders," Beilenson said. He also cited as a major 
accomplishment a plan to prevent illegal immigrants from receiving long-term 
earthquake relief. 
</P>
<P>
 But increasing partisanship is making life difficult for moderates in Congress 
and diminishing their prospects of passing meaningful legislation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have had helpful health care reform," he said. While the issue is 
likely to come up again in the next session, the program "will have to be less 
sweeping and it may have to allow states to act as the laboratories of change 
instead of imposing a whole new system for the country overnight." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite bitter disappointment over health care and failure to pass a campaign 
finance reform measure, "it's been a productive Congress," said Beilenson, who 
is considered vulnerable in this fall's elections because of a strong challenge 
from well-financed Republican Richard Sybert. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita), serving his first term, says 
life in Congress has been "very educational." McKeon, who served as president 
of the GOP's 47-member freshman class, counts among his accomplishments a 
successful battle to tighten the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's 
definition of "religious harassment" in the workplace. EEOC officials withdrew 
their plan after McKeon voiced objections to it. 
</P>
<P>
 However, McKeon said he was struck by the level of partisanship. 
</P>
<P>
 "The country is becoming more polarized. It looks like it's going to continue 
in that direction," he said. McKeon expressed disappointment that Congress 
passed no form of health care reform, saying "the climate was ripe" for at 
least incremental change. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), serving his sixth term, said he was 
elated with a provision in the crime bill to deploy 100,000 new police 
officers. Another provision is designed to increase the ranks of the border 
patrol by 1,000 each year for the next four years. Along with Beilenson, he 
wrote the section of the bill aimed at reimbursing states for the cost of 
imprisoning illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been doing some down-to-earth, nitty-gritty work," Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But like other Democrats, he said Congress missed a golden opportunity to 
overhaul the health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 And Berman laid some of the blame at the feet of the President. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to make a massive, revolutionary change without a foundation," he 
said. "The Administration's approach was too bureaucratic, and the Republicans 
made a political decision not to allow even improvement to the system to pass. 
But the mistakes made by the Administration were the mistakes of the 
well-intentioned." 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman, serving his 10th term, found himself in the spotlight throughout the 
session as a leading critic of the tobacco industry and a vocal advocate of 
universal health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned more this year about the tobacco industry than we have in the 
previous 10 years," he said. Waxman presided over a series of hearings on the 
industry and blasted tobacco company executives for allegedly concealing 
scientific evidence regarding the connection between smoking and health 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were shocked to learn that the tobacco companies had been manipulating the 
level of nicotine in cigarettes to keep people addicted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he considered Congress' failure to pass any form of health reform to be a 
serious setback. He said the White House waited too long to propose its program 
and made the plan too complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 The lion's share of the blame, however, lies with the Republican Party, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He accused GOP lawmakers of launching "mean-spirited and vitriolic attacks" 
against the President and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have come to realize that personal attacks work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale), serving his 11th term, ranked securities 
reform and a provision in the crime bill to punish sexual predators as his top 
accomplishments for the session. 
</P>
<P>
 But he expressed mixed feelings about the crime bill, which was lambasted by 
Republicans for spending too much money on prevention measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bill grew everywhere it went. It was growing much too rapidly, and most 
of the money was going to rather worthless social programs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Democrats and Republicans became more partisan, public perceptions of 
Congress worsened, Moorhead said.

FIREFIGHTER CREW STAYS ON WATCH AFTER CONTAINING AGUA DULCE FIRE; SAFETY: A 
CONTINGENT WILL REMAIN IN SANTA CLARITA TO GUARD AGAINST ANOTHER FLARE-UP 
BECAUSE HOT, DRY WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE WEEK.

 About 90 firefighters remained in Agua Dulce on Sunday to snuff out a brush 
fire that scorched more than 1,000 acres and threatened a mobile home park and 
other structures in this small community between the Antelope and Santa Clarita 
valleys, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four camp crews, a water tender and five engine companies remained at the 
scene and patrolled the edges of the fire area until about noon, said Lawrence 
Beals, a dispatch supervisor for the Los Angeles County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Beals said a contingent of five engine companies will remain in Santa Clarita 
to guard against another flare-up because hot, dry winds are predicted to 
continue throughout the week. 
</P>
<P>
 A downed power line is suspected of sparking the blaze, which broke out about 
10 a.m. Saturday near Agua Dulce Canyon Road south of the Antelope Valley 
Freeway, authorities said. It quickly spread west toward Santa Clarita, pushed 
by 20 m.p.h. Santa Ana winds, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thick clouds of smoke forced the closure of the freeway for about five hours 
Saturday, California Highway Patrol Officer Kerri Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleanup operations began about 8 p.m. Saturday, after firefighters, aided by 
firefighting aircraft, contained about 80% of the fire, Beals said. 
</P>
<P>
 As fire season gets under way, the County Fire Department is expected to begin 
using the CL-215T "Super Scooper" aircraft by the end of this week, Beals said. 
The aircraft, which is leased from the Canadian government, can scoop up to 
14,000 gallons of water as it skims the surface of large bodies of water, 
according to fire officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Weather forecasters predicted more Santa Ana conditions Monday, combined with 
near-record high temperatures, said Kris Farnsworth, a meteorologist with 
WeatherData Inc., a weather service used by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Weather Service office in Oxnard reported high temperatures of 95 
degrees in Van Nuys shortly after 1:30 p.m., said meteorologist Robert Krohn. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, temperatures in the San Fernando Valley are expected to range in 
the mid-90s with a high of 92 in Burbank and a high of 90 degrees in Woodland 
Hills in the west San Fernando Valley, Farnsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 The high, dry winds are expected to taper off by Tuesday, resulting in a 
10-degree temperature drop in most Valley communities, Farnsworth said. 
On-shore ocean winds between 5 and 15 m.p.h. are expected to bring patchy fog 
and clouds to inland Valley areas by Friday, Farnsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana winds are caused by high-pressure systems that develop over Nevada 
and Utah before they appear in Southern California as hot, dry northeastern 
winds that blow out of northern mountain areas, Farnsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The air is compressed as it moves down these slopes and heats up," Farnsworth 
explained.

STRONGHOLD OF THE ARTS TAKES SHAPE ABOVE CITY; CULTURE: THE $733-MILLION GETTY 
CENTER, ABOUT HALF COMPLETE, HAS SPARKED A FLURRY OF DEBATE. LOCAL MEDIA WILL 
GET A LOOK AT WHAT THE FUSS IS ALL ABOUT AT AN OPEN HOUSE THIS WEEK.

<P>
 To the wonderment and, no doubt, perplexity of hundreds of thousands of daily 
commuters, it rises in Sepulveda Pass like a 14th-Century mountaintop 
stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprawling along a ridge line high above the San Diego Freeway, the emerging 
structure of box-like buildings and interlocking walls presents a portentous 
visage of money and power. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 800 workers at a time, like the craftsman of a medieval city, stride its 
scaffolds laying Italian marble, scurry over its Olympian terraces planting 
trees by the thousand and scale its three-quarter-mile elevated causeway laying 
track for the tram that will someday connect this enclave on the hill to the 
world below. 
</P>
<P>
 Without so much as a sign to identify their purpose, they could as easily be 
erecting a hotel for the unconscionably rich or a retreat for an order of 
ascetic monks. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither commercial nor reclusive motives, however, are behind one of the 
largest construction projects under way in the western United States. The 
emerging wall of marble is to be a stronghold of the arts: the future home of 
the world's most formidable private arts institution, the J. Paul Getty Trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Already 10 years in the making -- and still three years from its scheduled 
1997 opening -- the $733-million Getty Center is now about half completed, a 
milestone that has prompted Getty officials to conduct an open house this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The informal tour Thursday will give the local news media a look inside the 
110-acre college-like campus that will consolidate the Getty's Malibu museum 
with the trust's art history, education and conservation programs, now in 
rented quarters in Santa Monica and Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 The scale and ambition of New York architect Richard Meier's project have 
touched off a flurry of debate. 
</P>
<P>
 While a minority of critics decry the center's provocative location and 
massive profile, no one denies that the Getty Center has already established 
itself as the Los Angeles cultural landmark to eclipse all others. 
</P>
<P>
 "If God had the money, this is perhaps what he would do," said the prickly Los 
Angeles design critic Sam Hall Kaplan, who was prepared to hate Meier's 
architectural statement but found he couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "The statement . . . is that this is a cultural institution here for the ages, 
not a passing indulgence, not a deconstructionist exercise by yet another 
narcissistic architect, of which there are many." 
</P>
<P>
 Less sanguine observers have faulted the center as elitist, remote and 
confusing, comparing it to the Getty Trust itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking up from the freeway below, motorists will see a series of mostly 
windowless marble cliffs, some as high as 120 feet above the slopes from which 
they spring," critic Leon Whiteson wrote in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that most of the criticism comes from the East, Kaplan said he detects 
a hidden envy that Los Angeles, and not New York, has the Getty, whose 
ambition, as New York Times architecture critic Paul Goldberger concedes, is 
"to spring full-blown from the brow of this hill in Brentwood as the world's 
largest, richest, most comprehensive and most ambitious institution in the 
visual arts." 
</P>
<P>
 Local commentators, indeed, can hardly restrain their expectation that the 
consolidated prestige of the Getty will elevate Los Angeles to the cultural 
status of New York and Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will become one of the must-visits for anyone who has traveled," said Los 
Angeles city Planning Director Con Howe. "Anyone will consider it as important 
as the Louvre or the National Gallery." 
</P>
<P>
 Howe, formerly a planner in New York City, said the Getty Center will be 
different from other great museums like the Metropolitan or the Pompidou 
because Los Angeles is a different kind of city from New York or Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaborating on that theme, architect David Martin said freeways have replaced 
rivers and grand boulevards as travel arteries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important for Los Angeles to have it along the freeway," Martin 
said. "It reminds all of the million or so people who drive it every day that 
there is a part of our culture that has to do with art and fineness and 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that's a bad idea to have in everybody's face every day," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The quintessential Los Angeles creation, the Getty Center may become the 
world's only important urban museum that will never be "discovered" by a 
tourist rambling the byways of a strange city. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors, who may need reservations to get in, will ride a Euro-style tramway 
from a six-level underground garage beside Sepulveda Boulevard to a formal 
transit stop atop the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, the 700 Getty employees will angle north toward the working end of 
the institution containing administrative offices and the bulk of the Getty's 
other arts programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The hilltop complex will also feature a cafe, a restaurant, a 450-seat 
auditorium, gardens, fountains and panoramic views of the mountains, the 
Pacific and the city skyline. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece, a museum complex of pavilions ringing a garden courtyard, 
will house all the existing Getty Museum's collections except its Greek and 
Roman antiquities, which will remain at the Malibu site. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new museum, visitors will be able to view such high-priced Getty 
treasures as Van Gogh's "Irises" bathed in natural light, as well as holdings 
the public has not seen before because of limited gallery space in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing like the center now exists in Los Angeles, or anywhere else. And it is 
unlikely that any contemporary institution but the Getty Trust, whose endowment 
is worth $4.1 billion, could afford such a project. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, the center and the trust evolved together. 
</P>
<P>
 Little known before J. Paul Getty's death in 1976, the trust gained visibility 
as it doubled, then tripled, the oil magnate's $1 billion bequest. 
</P>
<P>
 Required by federal law to spend no less than 4.25% of its assets each year, 
the trust began to sprout programs. There are now eight. They include a grants 
program, a high-tech art history information program, a worldwide program to 
promote the conservation of endangered artworks and a center for the history of 
art and the humanities, which offers yearlong fellowships to a dozen scholars. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Getty Trust President Harold Williams said he wanted to give each 
new program its own identity, with its own directors and space. The decision to 
pull them together on a campus presented the challenge "not only to help create 
the architecture, but also to create the institution itself," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 The give-and-take slowed the planning to a seven-year crawl. Along the way, 
costs climbed from the opening estimate of $360 million to the current $733 
million, bemusing some in an expectant art world. 
</P>
<P>
 "If most projects today suffer from too little time and too little money," 
observed critic Goldberger, the Getty's problem has been "too much time and too 
much money." 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, however, the project also has been molded by political 
compromise. The conditional use permit obtained by the trust in 1985 imposes 
107 conditions meant to mollify the wealthy and politically connected neighbors 
in Brentwood and Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum and related structures will occupy only a quarter of the 24 acres 
reserved for development at the top of the hill. A height limit of 65 feet 
above the plaza level for the museum complex and 45 feet for the other 
buildings forced Meier to abandon his vision of modeling the center's profile 
after an Italian mountaintop village with turrets and towers. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the neighborhood's objection that Meier's signature white enamel surfaces 
would create too much glare prevailed. In place of the smooth bright building 
skins, 180,000 slabs of rough-hewn beige travertine marble were imported from 
the same quarries that supplied the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
 As another concession, the center's seven-level, 1,550-space parking 
structure, now complete, is buried underground at the west end of the one 
access road, Getty Center Drive off Sepulveda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors' concerns about traffic led to the electric tram system. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these accommodations may contribute to the complaint that the 
experience of the Getty will be too orchestrated, like a visit to Walt Disney 
World, where by design, random experiences are kept to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is, above all, the imposing location that arouses the emotion of 
critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling it an "elitist statement 25 million times worse" than an ethnic slur, 
one architect who asked not to be named said the hilltop location represents an 
obvious disdain for the city below, a sentiment more suited to the 19th Century 
than the 20th. 
</P>
<P>
 Countering that view, Adolfo Nodal, general manager of the Los Angeles 
Department of Cultural Affairs, praised the Getty for its street-level programs 
to restore a mural by Mexican artist David Siqueiros on Olvera Street and 
assist the Watts Towers Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is up on a hill, and it will be a Taj Mahal, but I think they're aware of 
that and make sure the community gets there, and that they get to the 
community," Nodal said. "I think they're really focused now on trying to take 
this incredible bounty that they've got to make sure that the people in the 
city are getting access to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Getty officials are confident that the interplay of natural and man-made 
beauty will connect their center with the city below. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see it as a place where people will come to see Los Angeles," said Getty 
Museum Director John Walsh of the new complex and its sweeping vistas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a place that will have lots of moods," said Walsh, who, as an art 
historian, understands the power of atmospheric effects. "It's right where the 
sea air plays a teasing game with drier air inland, so fogs sometimes come in 
that far and then back off again and swirl around above you." 
</P>
<P>
 Now little more than concrete bones, the museum will be the center's big draw. 
Visitors will enter a two-story circular lobby, which will include a book and 
gift shop and two orientation theaters. The glass-filled lobby will open to a 
61,000-square-foot garden courtyard. Visitors can then choose among the five 
gallery pavilions that make up the museum proper. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh said the facility will allow people to see many of the Getty's holdings, 
long in storage, for the first time. There will be twice as much room for 
displaying photographs. The Getty's growing collection of drawings will have 
more gallery space, as will its little-known collection of European sculpture. 
Fourteen galleries will house the Getty's important collection of French 
furniture and decorative arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the paintings will be displayed in second-story galleries normally 
flooded with daylight. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are rooms that have exactly the kind of lively, beautiful natural light 
that most pictures were painted in and intended to be seen in," the director 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh said 1.5 million visitors a year are expected, triple what the Malibu 
museum can accommodate. As a result, the center will probably require visitors 
to make advance parking reservations, at least at first, just as the Malibu 
facility does. The plan is to drop the reservation requirement as soon as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 As the opening draws closer, one travertine slab and newly planted tree at a 
time, the one fear seems to be that the center will prove too popular. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the problem," Walsh said, "is going to be dealing with the number of 
people who want to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Aaron Curtiss contributed to this report. The Getty Center 
</P>
<P>
 The castle-like complex rising on the Brentwood hillside just west of the San 
Diego Freeway will open to the public in mid-1997. The 110-acre site will 
feature a museum, a restaurant/cafe, a 450-seat auditorium, acre upon acre of 
gardens, fountains and panoramic views of the mountains, the Pacific and West 
Los Angeles skyline. The project is expected to cost $733 million.

L.A. SCENE THE CITY THEN AND NOW : LIFE -- AND DEATH -- IN FAST LANE AT ASCOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CECILIA RASMUSSEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the day it opened -- Thanksgiving, 1924 -- until the day it burned down 
in 1936, torched by a former employee who said he didn't want to see any more 
of his friends killed, the Legion Ascot Speedway was profitable and deadly. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 80 thrilling years, speed-mad Angelenos had watched such greats 
as "Speed King" Barney Oldfield and his bitter rival, Ralph De Palma, "Blond 
Terror" Ernie Triplett and sensational Rex Mays as they raced in dashing 
scarves and driving goggles around Ascot Speedway's four sites, moving from 
South-Central to the Eastside to South Gate and finally Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
 The first (1907-1919) began as a one-mile dirt oval at Central and Florence 
avenues. Promoters named it Ascot to capitalize on the reputation of England's 
Ascot horse track. 
</P>
<P>
 Later came the smaller Ascot Motor Speedway (1924-1936), a five-eighths-mile 
dirt oval in Lincoln Heights at Soto Street and Valley Boulevard -- the one 
that became notorious as Legion Ascot. 
</P>
<P>
 After that closed, Southern Ascot (1937-1942) boasted a half-mile dirt raceway 
in South Gate. The last Ascot (1957-1990) opened on an old dump site at 182nd 
Street and Vermont Avenue in Gardena.  
</P>
<P>
 The deadliest of all those sites was the second. It was called the "killer 
track" because in 13 years its treacherous straightaways and dangerously banked 
turns claimed the lives of 24 drivers -- more deaths than at any other track in 
the nation during that same period. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1924, racing impresario George R. Bentel and his talented publicist, Bill 
Pickens, who had opened the first Ascot track, built the second on several 
thousand acres of leased land. 
</P>
<P>
 It opened with a Thanksgiving crowd of 25,000 watching drivers risk their 
necks at speeds above 80 m.p.h. on a dirt track made fast by steady 
applications of crude oil. Indianapolis 500 victor De Palma won the main race. 
</P>
<P>
 That day, the spectators saw Jimmy Craft crash his Frontenac into the 
guardrail on a curve. Craft, hurled onto the track, began to stand up, waving 
to show the crowd he was all right. As he did, driver Norris Shears crashed 
into him. Both men were killed instantly. That curve, where many would die, 
came to be known as "King of the Grim Reapers." 
</P>
<P>
 Ascot provided a hearty welcome for those seeking hair-raising action and 
big-money prizes, drawing drivers from across the nation: national AAA champion 
Bob Carey, "Midwest Cyclone" Bryon Saulspaugh, "Bald Eagle" Francis Quinn, and 
happy-go-lucky and hell-for-leather driver Al Gordon. Indianapolis 500 winners 
Fred Frame, George Souders, Frank Lockhart, Louie Schneider, Wilbur Shaw and 
the colorful "Wild Bill" Cummings also came west to race at Legion Ascot. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1926, drivers Bill Bundy and Jack Peticord locked wheels on a turn and 
their cars skidded into the pits, fatally crushing a waiting driver, Nick 
Guglielmi, and a Los Angeles policeman standing nearby.  
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, American Legion Post 127 of Glendale assumed management of 
the track from Bentel, giving the track the name by which everyone came to know 
it. Legionnaires worked as ushers and ticket takers, and entertained fans with 
their marching band. 
</P>
<P>
 Movie stars such as Bing Crosby, Andy Devine, Loretta Young, Clark Gable, 
Charlie Chaplin, Edward G. Robinson, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Clara Bow and 
Carole Lombard also entertained, just by showing up to watch. Sometimes, the 
actresses presented victory crowns to winners. 
</P>
<P>
 But repeated violent deaths at Ascot would bring its downfall. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Great Depression gripped the country in 1933, six deaths in one year 
caused a wave of indignation. Newspaper headlines such as "Legalized Murder," 
"Widow Weeps as Mate Dies," "Is It Worth It?" and "What a Price to Pay" 
reflected the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, racing continued, and Ascot's crowds were bigger than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 But so great was the furor that in 1934, after another death, the American 
Legion, fearing more tragedies and controversy, bowed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Legion Ascot's last race was on Jan. 25, 1936. In the day's feature race, Al 
Gordon, one of Ascot's most popular drivers, was killed in his two-seater, 
along with his mechanic, Spider Matlock. 
</P>
<P>
 The track was padlocked. Four months later, fire destroyed the grandstands. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years after that, Linden Emerson, a former janitor at the track, turned 
himself in, confessing, "I saw Al Gordon and Spider Matlock killed out there 
and when the track was closed, I thought maybe they might reopen it and kill 
some more of my friends. So, I decided to burn the grandstand down." 
</P>

VALLEY CHRONICLE: JOHN WOODEN TEACHES SOME VALUABLE LESSONS IN GAME OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA basketball coach emeritus John Wooden was informed by his 9-year-old 
granddaughter that her coach wanted grandpa to come and talk to the girl's 
elementary school basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden, who will celebrate his 84th birthday on Thursday, wanted to know whose 
idea it was. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both (of ours)," she responded, "but I said I'd ask you because you couldn't 
turn me down." 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden, the Wizard of Westwood, doesn't put up much of a defense when friends 
and family put the touch on him. 
</P>
<P>
 He'll also be speaking at the fourth annual benefit dinner for the Cal State 
Northridge basketball program, which begins at 5:30 p.m. Nov. 6 at the Airtel 
Plaza Hotel in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime Wooden friend and CSUN basketball coach, Pete Cassidy, invited him. 
In terms of local interest, it was a three-point play. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy, who's friendship with Wooden goes back 30 years, said Wooden's wisdom 
has helped him with coaching, as well as life's challenges. Cassidy says he 
wanted the former UCLA coach to share those insights with the community. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of Wooden's tenets have been particularly meaningful, said Cassidy: 
Success is the peace of mind you get from doing the best you can at becoming 
the best you can, and don't worry about what you don't have, just do your best 
with what you have. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy said it sounds simple, but putting those strategies into your personal 
game book is difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 And it also sounds a bit disingenuous coming from a man who coached his Bruins 
to 10 national championships between 1964 and 1976 with guys like Lew Alcindor 
-- a.k.a. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden knew how to recruit as well as shape and mold teams, Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by the foot traffic to Wooden's Encino condominium, he still has the 
ability to show people how to meet life's problems without fouling out. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy said he visits with Wooden about twice monthly and is just one of 
dozens of friends, coaches and former players like Bill Walton and Abdul-Jabbar 
who regularly beat a path to Wooden's door. 
</P>
<P>
 And although he is no longer able to take the long walks he used to love, he 
keeps fit by riding a stationary bicycle. Wooden's body may be not as willing, 
but his mind is game-day focused and can still defend ideas with an 
intellectual full-court press, Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach is a philosopher. He has a master's degree, as well as being a book 
writer and poet," Cassidy said. "He's comfortable with ideas and articulates 
them with a clarity that's always been a gift." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wooden doesn't seem to want any of his sports friends, particularly those 
who are now coaching, to think he's second-guessing them in any way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I once thanked him for a suggestion and he said it was not a suggestion, just 
a personal opinion," Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Wooden still attends every Bruin home basketball game, and that 
Cassidy's team meets UCLA at Pauley Pavilion Nov. 26, will not present any 
conflict, says Cassidy. Wooden's wisdom transcends basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, this is not just a basketball rally with food and a $50 price 
tag. It's an opportunity to listen to a motivational speaker who's a straight 
shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gives a good talk. He's a good man. He can enlighten and entertain," said 
Cassidy, who added that anyone in the community can attend the Wooden speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden's talk to his granddaughter's basketball team is, however, by 
invitation only. But they don't get dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, they don't have to pay $50 either. 'Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman' 
Helps Heal the Local Economy 
</P>
<P>
 The California Film Commission says the production of programs like "Dr. 
Quinn, Medicine Woman" is creating a healthy economy for communities 
surrounding Paramount Ranch, where that and other shows are filmed in the Santa 
Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Vendors in Agoura Hills, Calabasas and Westlake Village benefit richly from 
"Dr. Quinn," commission Director Patti Archuletta says. 
</P>
<P>
 She adds that a recent study by the Public Affairs Coalition of the Alliance 
of Motion Picture and Television Producers showed that Agoura Hills, for 
example, is getting some mighty big bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 During 1992, the alliance says $55 million was spent in Agoura Hills alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds unbelievable. But alliance officials say the figure includes the salary 
of industry people, their personal purchases -- including homes in the area -- 
as well as production costs. The production costs themselves are interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 Archuletta says that in one year the "Dr. Quinn" production company spends 
more than $100,000 on lumber and $23,000 on gasoline. Each week, show producers 
spend $600 for horseshoes, $800 for bakery items and an unspecified dollar 
amount for the weekly purchase of 1,500 pounds of ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen hundreds pounds of ice? 
</P>
<P>
 What could any group outside of the Kings hockey team and a bunch of guys with 
badly overheating radiators be doing weekly with 1,500 pounds of the cold 
stuff? 
</P>
<P>
 Is someone studying cryonics? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the actual explanation is not so exotic. 
</P>
<P>
 They use the ice to cool soft drinks for cast and crew members. Author Recalls 
Life on Bayou Before She Saw the 'Forrest' 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Hager is a Calabasas author who spent her formative years in Alabama, 
where she has set the stories to several of her more popular adult and youth 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 She particularly likes the shrimping town of Bayou La Batre, which she 
considers an interesting locale for her children's novels. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, she is not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 She is now competing for geographical bragging rights to this steamy turf with 
another Alabamian author, Winston Groom. 
</P>
<P>
 Hager says a movie was made from Groom's book and quite a few people seem to 
have seen it. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie is called "Forrest Gump." 
</P>
<P>
 Hager, seventysomething, has spent 43 years in Los Angeles, including 40 in 
the San Fernando Valley. But she says that hasn't erased her memories of life 
in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 She recently completed a book-signing tour for her latest effort, "Jake and 
the Pirate's Treasure," which has been released by Zondervan House along with 
three of her previous young people's books. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern swing was, she says, a nice trip down memory lane. 
</P>
<P>
 It reminded her of how she got hooked on writing at the age of 8, when she 
entered a story contest sponsored by the Mobile Press Register. So did another 
young author named Truman Capote. She says her story won. 
</P>
<P>
 For her next book she is thinking of taking a jab at writing the biography of 
the country's first woman professional boxer. 
</P>
<P>
 Even she has to smile at this idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't made up my mind yet. It's such a change for me to write 
nonfiction," says the novelist. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, one of two things could happen. 
</P>
<P>
 The book could give her nonfiction career a body blow, or she might deliver a 
knockout punch. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, she plans to keep on writing, so move over Forrest. Overheard 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell the truth. Do you make up those overheards, or do you just go to a lot 
of strange places and have a lot of weird friends.?"

question and took the Fifth on the second part.

MAN WANTED IN 3 SLAYINGS IS ARRESTED WITH $61,500 IN CASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man sought by Arkansas authorities in connection with three slayings was 
arrested along with his cousin in Altadena after Los Angeles County sheriff's 
deputies found them with two plastic grocery bags filled with $61,500 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Kelley, 31, and Anthony Kelley, 30, were taken into custody Friday and 
booked for investigation of robbery after they could not explain to deputies 
how they got the money, Deputy Irma Becerra said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 During booking, deputies learned that Joe Kelley was wanted in Little Rock in 
connection with the shooting deaths of three men. He was being held Sunday 
pending extradition proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies also discovered that Anthony Kelley was wanted on a Pasadena 
narcotics violation. He was being held Sunday in lieu of $35,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The men were arrested outside an apartment complex in the 600 block of 
Altadena Drive after deputies, who were on a routine investigation, saw them 
sitting in a car in the parking lot. Police spotted the bags filled with $100 
and $50 bills in their vehicle, Becerra said.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Faulty power lines failed Sunday in Newhall, snarling traffic and knocking out 
power to more than 1,000 residents for two hours, Los Angeles County sheriff's 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 No accidents or injuries were caused by the outage, which occurred at 2:18 
p.m. at a Southern California Edison substation and left 1,173 customers 
without power, said Sgt. Jim Morrow.Power was restored at 4:31 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The outage also knocked out traffic lights at several intersections. To help 
clear up traffic jams, Santa Clarita crews erected temporary stop signs at 
intersections. 
</P>
<P>
 Cher Vierra, a spokeswoman for Southern California Edison, said the outage was 
caused by a bad section of electrical lines at the company's Newhall 
substation. The lines were replaced by Edison crews. JEFF SCHNAUFER

A COMMON GOAL; SANTA ANA, SOCCER LEAGUES KICK OFF NEW ERA OF COMMUNICATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years, thousands of this city's soccer players have scrambled for suitable 
fields to play on and groused that Santa Ana leaders have stood in their way. 
At the same time, city officials have decried street violence and sought ways 
to keep kids away from gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, both camps found common ground for the first time in years. They 
came together to inaugurate three new city soccer fields in Centennial Park at 
festivities complete with mariachi music, a ribbon cutting, games on all 
fields, and plenty of handshaking and speeches by public officials who have had 
little contact with the Latino community leagues before now. "We consider it 
monumental," said Santa Ana attorney Jess Araujo, one of the organizers. "It's 
finally happening after all these years. Finally, someone decided to organize 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 The event drew an estimated 5,000 soccer players from ADELA -- the Associacion 
Deportiva Latinoamericana -- and was lauded by councilman and mayoral candidate 
Miguel A. Pulido Jr. as the beginning of a new era of communication between the 
city and the grass-roots grid of soccer lovers. The group of leagues boasts 
about 19,000 players, and organizers estimate that about 15,000 live in Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wonderful to see all these people so excited about sports," said Pulido, 
who cut the ribbon and was followed onto the field by thousands of soccer 
players and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the beginning of not only a new day but a new way of working together 
that is beautiful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Pulido, other Santa Ana council members at the rally were Ted 
R. Moreno, Robert L. Richardson and Patricia McGuigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers hope that Sunday's rally will be a first step toward easing the 
bitter and long-standing tensions between the city recreation department and 
the independent leagues, who complain that in the past they have had to fight 
for access to Santa Ana's limited and poorly maintained fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "All they want is to say, 'Let's be equitable about this. What can we do to 
get more soccer fields and how can we use the ones we have more equitably,' " 
Araujo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue, however, is far from resolved. Two weeks ago, the city's Department 
of Recreation and Community Services opened the state-of-the art Centennial 
Park Soccer Facility with its own ribbon cutting as a kickoff to the newly 
formed city soccer league, the first in Santa Ana's history. 
</P>
<P>
 The city league, said department manager Jon (Rip) Ribble, will get preference 
on the new fields, which are gated and locked. The new city teams took a day 
off their tournament Sunday to allow the independent leagues to try out the 
fields. He stressed, however, that the city league is open to everyone and that 
the department "never tried to give anybody the cold shoulder."  
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a cry for soccer fields for years, and for years we have 
promised that as soon as there is funding we would create new fields. But we 
never promised the fields to any one particular league," Ribble said. "There's 
a lot of other places where leagues are playing. We're continuing to allow them 
to play on those fields. It's just that we reserved these new fields for the 
new league." 
</P>
<P>
 But ADELA members say they hope Sunday's rally sends a signal that they plan 
to keep clamoring for what they believe is their right to play on all the 
city's fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "Equal access to the parks is all we ask, including to Centennial Park. That's 
the reason for this whole battle. We all pay taxes," said Humberto Lopez, who 
heads a league of restaurant and hotel workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hispanic community is a very large community and somehow it's not 
recognized. We're trying to find out what are our mistakes, so we can be with 
the system. If no one teaches us the system, how do we know?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said the leagues provide a great service to the city's youth and should 
get some recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Discipline is strict. I tell them, 'Don't come over here and make a bad 
scene.' It keeps adults out of gangs. For kids, it keeps them off drugs, off 
gangs, off any activity that's against the law. That's what the leagues do," 
Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, he said, they have been struggling with Santa Ana park officials to 
gain access to fields, and complaining about dusty, rutted conditions and lack 
of lighting there. Sometimes, he said, the city would not unlock bathrooms for 
them during their games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to go running around looking for a bathroom, kids and ladies and 
everyone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ribble counters that neighbors near those fields have complained about the 
constant activity. They say the players wake them up early in the morning with 
their music and leave trash on the fields at night. Creating a city league 
solves the problem, because it grants the city more control over when and where 
the teams play. The gates at Centennial allow the city to control the amount of 
use and keep the fields green and sodded, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that many members of the city league, which is hoping to expand 
from 11 to 80 teams for the next season, in January, came from ADELA teams, and 
some of them complained that costs on their old teams were high and 
unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We said, 'Hey. This is a golden opportunity to run this program the way we 
wanted it to run.' The city league will have access to the new fields, we'll 
hire people to run the league and have people in the community involved. We'll 
also have open space so some of these other people can have opportunities," 
Ribble said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lopez, who has run his league since 1984, said many of the leagues enjoy 
their independence and don't want to be run by the city. They simply want 
access to the fields. 
</P>
<P>
 The standoff may be coming to an end, Lopez said, but only because people with 
a little more political know-how have stepped in on his side to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Sergio Velasquez, publisher of a Santa Ana Spanish-language weekly, 
began looking for allies for the leagues. Among them, he found Araujo, and his 
law partner Andrew Di Marco, who are helping ADELA to secure nonprofit status. 
He also found Pulido, who is working to rally community support for the coming 
election and says he is concerned with recreational opportunities for youth. 
The councilman helped the group reserve the park for Sunday's event. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're working so hard to take people off the street," Velasquez said. "Here 
is something that is very inexpensive -- the cheapest kind of activity they can 
engage in. We get a field and a soccer ball and they're out and running. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had to pay people to be captains of leagues and get the kids out and 
bring out the seniors, we couldn't pay them enough. And here they're doing it 
for free. It's a beautiful thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido said he wasn't aware of the years-long history of struggle between the 
leagues and the city before he met with ADELA leaders a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I assumed that (the Centennial Park fields) were open to a lot of people to 
use them. As it turns out, the plan had been for the new fields to mainly serve 
the leagues that the city had formed," Pulido said. "Let's just say that 
unfortunately I was not aware of what was occurring relative to access to the 
fields. I told them let's work together. We're talking about some really neat 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've made the commitment and the council's behind it to provide access," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the recent plans, Pulido said, is an offer by ADELA players to volunteer 
their landscaping expertise to keep up the city's fields for free. Pulido is 
currently working with the city attorney's office to iron out liability 
glitches and Ribble said his department welcomes the help. 
</P>
<P>
 League organizers are pleased to have pried open the door to city government, 
but they are wary that once the Sunday festivities end, they will once again be 
shut out. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers such as Araujo said they hope that won't happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in the interest of the fathers of the city to recognize that this group 
has been promoting healthy values. It's a healthy sport. It's a healthy 
competition," he said. "They bring a tremendous benefit to the community and it 
should go both ways. . . . They do want people to know that they are a major 
force of organized family values." 
</P>
<P>
 The fields drew rave reviews from many of the players who said they are eager 
to start playing on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good about the whole thing," said 22-year-old Daniel Diaz. "This will 
eliminate some of the problems in finding places to play and these are much 
better fields than we had been playing on."

IDEOLOGY LOOMS OVER SCHOOL BOARD RACES IN S. COUNTY; ELECTIONS: CONSERVATIVES 
COMPLAIN OF MISLABELING. OTHERS FEAR 'EXTREMISTS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With a crowded field of candidates and a chance that conservatives could gain 
a majority on the Saddleback Valley Unified School District board, South County 
is abuzz about the most volatile campaigns for school trustee posts in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 As national conservative Christian groups -- two of which are headquartered in 
the county -- have focused on school board races across the country, including 
here in Orange County, longtime activists in Saddleback and Capistrano Unified 
are sounding the alarm that candidates they consider "extremists" could take 
over South County districts. 
</P>
<P>
 But the candidates tagged as extremists reject the label, saying they shun 
ties to the Christian right. They claim they are simply conservatives anxious 
to improve the educational system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just a mom who wants to run for school board and I'm being painted as 
this diabolical candidate," said Pat Soriano, a Lake Forest resident who is 
seeking one of two open seats in the Saddleback district. "Absolutely, I'm 
conservative. Conservative in this area is mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, according to the South Orange County Chambers of Commerce and the 
parent group Community Action for Public Schools, which was founded last year 
in response to the conservative shift on the Saddleback board that occurred 
when Frank L. Ury and Debbie Hughes were elected in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Both organizations issued biting press releases last week warning of an 
extremist threat. The chamber has endorsed school board candidates for the 
first time in eight years, backing the incumbents in both local districts 
without interviewing any of the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are really out of step with our community," said Louise Adler of 
Laguna Hills, associate professor of education at Cal State Fullerton and a 
former Saddleback school board member. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an issue of whether or not (religious people) should be part of 
the political process," said Adler, who co-chairs Community Action for Public 
Schools. "It's a question of whether people of a particular religious 
persuasion should have a right to control it." 
</P>
<P>
 Adler and others said they fear that, if conservatives are elected, the 
schools would be rife with censorship, biased curricula and school prayer would 
be introduced, and services for poor and bilingual students would be curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Soriano and other self-identified conservative candidates -- Dave Schultz, 
Susan Krumpotich and Bill Goodwin in Saddleback, and Dorsey Brause and Morrie 
Hansen in Capistrano -- said they oppose school prayer. They do acknowledge 
that cutting spending and changing the curricula are among their plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the county, veterans of last year's failed voucher initiative and 
those who opposed the state's new testing system are also being targeted as 
right-wingers and Christian "stealth candidates" who want to dismantle public 
education. That leaves some candidates crying about a backlash in which all 
conservatives are being accused of running stealth campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 A pair of Tustin Unified candidates, for example, have been accused of ties to 
the Christian right by members of that community. But one candidate, Jonathan 
Abelove, is Jewish, and the other, Jane Bauer, is a lifelong Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected there would be a lot of things said about me that would not be 
true, but you don't know until it happens how awful it feels," Abelove said 
after a forum on "stealth candidates" last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is dangerous," said Bauer, a Tustin schools trustee for nine 
years. "We have to be careful about labeling, and the electorate has to be 
careful about listening to these labels." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Christian and right-wing groups have turned their attention 
to local politics, hoping to create a grass-roots groundswell, bring public 
schools back toward traditional values, and groom conservatives for higher 
posts. The six most conservative candidates in the South County races insisted 
that they are not connected to such groups, but in interviews and campaign 
literature they echo the groups' pro-family agendas. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they refused to say which candidates they favor, leaders of the 
Christian Coalition, the Anaheim-based Traditional Values Coalition and 
Citizens for Excellence in Education, a Costa Mesa group, all acknowledged 
plans to devote more money and energy than ever to school boards this fall.  
</P>
<P>
 But campaign finance statements filed last week show no financial support for 
any South County candidate from any Christian organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a long time, (Orange County has) had strong, conservative, pro-family 
representation at the state level and on the board of supervisors . . . we want 
to take the success we've had with the top and seek to bring that influence to 
the more localized races," said Rev. Lou Sheldon of Traditional Values 
Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have strong beliefs," added Sara Di Vito Hardman, California director for 
the Christian Coalition, which held an organizational meeting in Orange County 
last week. "We're not trying to necessarily impose our beliefs, but why should 
beliefs be imposed on us and our kids?" 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rev. George Hooper, associate pastor at Shepherd of the Hills in 
Mission Viejo, said he is concerned about the rise of conservative Christians 
in politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a problem with anybody being religious. I don't have a problem 
with anybody being on the right of the political spectrum," Hooper said. "But 
when one theological perspective is claimed as the only true Christian 
perspective on a political issue, it is demeaning to persons of all faiths." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is the issue hotter than the Saddleback Valley district, which already 
has two conservative board members in Ury and Hughes. With four conservatives 
seeking two seats, the results of the Nov. 8 election could tip the balance of 
power on the volatile school board, which has been plagued by marathon 
meetings, nasty squabbling and 3-2 votes over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 10 candidates signed up to run for the two Saddleback seats, but 
two have dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
 Still running are incumbents Dore J. Gilbert and Bobbee Cline, who received 
the Chamber of Commerce endorsement; Soriano and Schultz, who are backed by Ury 
and Hughes; Pamela Rush and Sande Gonzalez, who were heavily involved in the 
recent debate over the Mission Viejo High School mascot; and Krumpotich and 
Goodwin, who have been accused of connections to the religious right but are 
generally seen as more moderate than Schultz and Soriano. 
</P>
<P>
 In Capistrano Unified, Brause, a semi-retired former president of a Christian 
college who has lived in the area for three years, is running against Annette 
B. Gude, a 14-year veteran of the board. In the same district, incumbent 
Crystal Kochendorfer faces a challenge by Hansen, a real estate broker who has 
served as the auctioneer for many school and charity events. 
</P>
<P>
 All six conservative candidates said they support Proposition 187, the 
initiative which would deny public education to illegal immigrants. Most 
incumbent board members, along with the state's teachers' union, oppose the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the council voted to give officials of the water district time to 
present a plan The Saddleback Republican Assembly, a right-wing group, has 
endorsed Schultz, Soriano, Brause and Hansen. 
</P>
<P>
 The parent group and the Chamber of Commerce have reserved their harshest 
words for Schultz and Soriano, who plan to share funds and put their names on 
the same flyers. Both candidates are members of the Saddleback Valley Community 
Church, and both attended the Christian Coalition meeting, where their campaign 
literature was distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz, 33, an engineer who warned in a church newsletter that acceptance of 
divorce, sex outside of marriage and homosexuality "will have dire consequences 
for a society already suffering moral decay," is a Mission Viejo resident with 
four young children. Soriano, 45, has three children, and has been active in 
local schools for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 In their literature and in interviews, both candidates said they support a 
back-to-basics curriculum, with character education that emphasizes American 
citizenship and Judeo-Christian values. They also said they hope to fight tax 
hikes, cut student fees and increase parental control over instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 They are proud of their Christianity and conservatism, but loathe the label 
"religious right." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind being called conservative. I just don't like being labeled 
extremists," Schultz said. "I think they're trying to create some hysteria." 
They accused incumbents Cline and Gilbert of being "closet Democrats," though 
both are registered Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Cline, who has been on the board for five years, notes on her campaign flyer 
that she teaches Sunday school. Gilbert, a physician, was first elected in 
1981. Both received support from teachers' unions in the last election. 
</P>
<P>
 The incumbents fear that if Schultz or Soriano are elected, the local schools 
will head in an entirely new direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are people who are moving through life with blinders on and don't 
respect people who have other points of view," Gilbert said. "I think it's time 
for the people of our community to let these people know that we will not be 
intimidated or bullied by their actions."

 Ordinance Adopted to Set Direction for Sidewalk Cyclists 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has adopted an ordinance that requires bicyclists riding on 
the sidewalk to travel in the same direction as traffic on the adjacent street. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, which received final approval last week, applies to sidewalks 
along major streets, not those along residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Violation of the ordinance will be punishable by a fine of $25 for the first 
offense, said police Sgt. Larry Griswold. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance is expected to result in fewer accidents between bicycles and 
vehicles when the bicycles cross perpendicular streets and driveways, Griswold 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Griswold said that in 1991, there were 14 injury accidents involving bicycles. 
In 1992, that number rose to 36, and last year to 42. 
</P>
<P>
 Police plan to start enforcing the ordinance the first week of November, 
Griswold said. DEBRA CANO

 A $398 contribution to Planning Commission Chairwoman Norma Glover's City 
Council campaign may force Irvine-based Taco Bell Corp. to reapply for 
permission to build a 24-hour eatery across West Coast Highway from the Balboa 
Bay Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Glover has denied allegations that she violated the Political Reform Act, 
saying the property changed hands before the contribution was made. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not done anything illegal. I cannot be bought for $99 and I cannot be 
bought for $200. My opponent has absolutely no record to run on. He has nothing 
to offer so he has to tear me down," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her attorney, Dana Reed, said the property changed hands June 30 and the 
contributions were not made until July 11.  
</P>
<P>
 Council candidate Art De La Loza brought campaign finance disclosures to 
Thursday's meeting and mounted the attack on Glover, who was absent. He alleged 
she has a conflict of interest because she accepted $398 in contributions from 
Levon and Zarouhi Gugasian just months before Taco Bell applied to operate a 
restaurant at 1400 W. Coast Highway, on land owned by the Gugasians. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission has yet to vote on the issue, but it has held 
discussions and two public hearings about it. Glover has said she favors the 
project, as do several other panel members. A primary problem with the 
application has been Taco Bell's insistence on 24-hour operation. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Loza, a deputy city attorney in Huntington Beach, is running against 
Glover for the District 3 council seat, from which Councilwoman Evelyn R. Hart 
is retiring. 
</P>
<P>
 He lives on Kings Place on the bluff above the proposed site and has objected, 
along with his neighbors, to the potential noise and crime problems an 
all-night restaurant could cause. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thursday he focused on Glover's acceptance of the contribution, saying she 
has influenced the process in Taco Bell's favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "This entire proceeding is tainted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the first public hearing on the restaurant, the City National Bank has 
foreclosed on the property, but the Gugasians may try to maintain their 
interest in it, said Taco Bell real estate manager Skip Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the five commissioners present postponed a vote until Nov. 10 to 
give City Atty. Robert Burnham time to research whether the potential conflict 
will send Taco Bell back to square one of the permit process or merely force 
Glover to abstain from voting on the permit application. HOLLY J. WAGNER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; COUNCIL TO RECONSIDER SEWER SERVICE OPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After the issue spent months on the back burner, the City Council once again 
will consider whether to separate from the Los Alamitos County Water District, 
which provides sewer services to residents here and other communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members will decide today whether to file an application with the 
Local Agency Formation Commission to begin the process that could eventually 
lead to the city taking over sewer services for residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the council voted to give officials of the water district time to 
present a plan for the maintenance of the 54 miles of sewer lines linking 
households here and in Rossmoor, Seal Beach and Cypress to a county sewer 
treatment plant amid concerns that the district does not have enough reserve 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Alamitos district staff study indicated that the water district needs 
about $25 million to pay for repairs and replacement of the aging sewer lines, 
but the water district only has about $1 million in reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 The money would not be enough in case of a major disaster, like an earthquake, 
the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the study indicated that the city could save about $30,000 a year 
by assuming sewer services, with income expected at $74,000 a year and expenses 
estimated at $44,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials of the district argued that Los Alamitos residents will pay 
higher rates if the city takes over sewer services. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, they said that the water district has maintained sewer services 
for the past 42 years efficiently and without imposing user's fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents pay an average of $1.25 a month for sewer services, which are taken 
from a portion of their property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The process of separating from the water district is complicated and could 
take from six months to a year. In addition to the $5,000 filing fee, the city 
would incur additional legal and engineering expenses. BERT ELJERA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; CAMPAIGN TO TARGET ABUSE AGAINST ELDERLY 
</P>

<P>
 One out of every six persons over the age of 60 are abused, whether physically 
or emotionally, according to the Area Agency on Aging and Adult Protective 
Services in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Operating on these statistics, the ARV Housing Group will start putting up 
billboards today around Costa Mesa, offering public workshops and distributing 
written material discussing the signs of elderly abuse, said Patti Barbee, the 
vice president of the group, which develops and manages affordable housing in 
the city of Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "The saddest part in all the abuse is that only one out of every 14 cases are 
reported to authorities," Barbee said. "The victims usually suffer in silence." 
</P>
<P>
 The group will also provide free temporary housing for victims and make 
referrals to local senior service agencies, including the Area Agency on Aging 
and Adult Protective Services, which offers intervention programs on behalf of 
elder abuse victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The prevention campaign was announced last week at the company's annual "Mr. 
and Ms. Senior ARV" celebration, an annual event at the Costa Mesa Senior 
Center. The winners were Bill Welty, a resident of the company's Villa Bonita 
residence in San Diego, and Dottie Worthen, who resides at ARV's Villa de Palma 
in Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
 The company owns and operates nearly 40 residential care facilities, 
independent senior apartments and multifamily housing communities throughout 
the nation. TOM RAGAN

<P>
 Hoover Park, which residents initially opposed because of fear that it would 
attract gangs, was dedicated this weekend as the city's 22nd park. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-acre park on Hoover and 21st streets opened during the summer and has 
attracted families from nearby neighborhoods, allaying fears that it will be a 
hangout for gang members, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The "passive" park provides picnic areas, benches, and playground equipment 
for children. 
</P>
<P>
 The park was built on Southern California Edison's right-of-way along Hoover 
Street at a cost of $250,000, which was paid for with state park grants and 
money the city has set aside for parks. BERT ELJERA

 Karen M. Judkin has withdrawn as a school board candidate for the Tustin 
Unified School District in the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Judkin, a business consultant, said last week that she withdrew because her 
family is moving out of the school district.She was running for a four-year 
seat on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Her name will appear in the ballot, she said, because it was too late to have 
it removed, but she has told supporters that she has stopped campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 With her withdrawal, six candidates will vie for the two open seats, including 
incumbents Jane Bauer, Nancy Cast and Gloria Matta Tuchman. The other 
candidates are businessmen Jonathan W. Abelove and Nimesh Desai, and Robert L. 
Douglas, a maintenance services employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Five other candidates are seeking a two-year seat on the board: Gail 
Michelsen, a computer product manager; Robert D. Machado, a computer software 
engineer; Jon H. Soeder, a business owner; David A. Lampert, a business owner, 
and Malcolm D. Jones, a part-time professor at UC Irvine. BERT ELJERA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BREA; URBAN KIDS TEST OUTSIDER APPROACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One way to help teens cope with the ills of urban living, Randy Gamboa 
figured, was to give them a break from the urban environment. 
</P>
<P>
 So, at age 19, he founded American Explorers and began taking high school and 
junior high school students on wilderness excursions. 
</P>
<P>
 That was in 1986. Today, the nonprofit, volunteer organization is struggling 
to keep up with the demand for its services. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the recent growth in our organization, we don't have enough 
transportation," said Gamboa, who has launched a fund-raising campaign to 
purchase an additional van. Paying for rental vehicles to use on the outings 
would make the trips too expensive, he said. As a result, teens now must sign 
waiting lists in hopes of going on outdoor adventures such as backpacking, rock 
climbing, white-water rafting and canoeing. 
</P>
<P>
 "What (the trips) teach the kids is very important," Gamboa said. Adapting to 
extreme environments helps young people develop better values, leadership 
abilities and other assets "that will last them a lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Gamboa was barely out of high school when he started American 
Explorers, gaining trust and respect in the community was not easy at first, he 
said. But perseverance paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, the organization was able to open a youth center in a space 
donated by the Brea Heights Shopping Center. Now, youth from ages 9 to 18 drop 
in for roller hockey, video games, table tennis and Tuesday night counseling 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Providing guidance to American Explorers is a board of directors made up of 
elected city officials and business leaders, including Carl Karcher. Input is 
also provided by the youth themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board really respects them," Gamboa said. "It keeps us in touch with 
youth ideals."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ANAHEIM; COUNCIL PUTS OFF PLAN FOR TRAIN NOISE STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After complaints from residents, the City Council decided last week to delay 
its plan to study a nagging train noise problem in a residential community near 
Anaheim Stadium.  
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Northfield Avenue expressed skepticism at the council meeting 
Tuesday that the city's proposal would abate train noise quickly enough.They 
argued the city's proposal to commission an environmental study and enlist 
financial support from nearby cities, and county, state and federal 
transportation authorities would take years. 
</P>
<P>
 But leaders of a neighborhood coalition agreed to present the city's plan to 
residents this week for further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors submitted a petition with more than 800 signatures this summer 
demanding the council help build a sound wall along the Atchison, Topeka & 
Santa Fe railroad tracks, which run within yards of residences. Neighbors have 
been upset over a growing noise problem since January, when a second railroad 
line was opened increasing the number of trains passing by from about four to 
40. In the next decade, the number of trains may increase to 100, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials stressed Tuesday night that the burden of mitigating train 
noise should not fall solely upon Anaheim. Rather, it's a regional problem, 
requiring a regional and multi-agency solution, said a city staff proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, who have said they cannot afford the estimated $3 million to 
build a sound wall, said a noise study should be conducted. Officials will also 
explore creating an assessment district, so residents could pay for the sound 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is expected to vote on that proposal on Tuesday. MARTIN 
MILLER

<P>
 The now complete Pacific Park Drive bridge over Aliso Creek and Aliso and Wood 
Canyons Regional Park will be dedicated and opened to through traffic Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9 a.m. ceremony will begin with Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley 
and Aliso Viejo Community Assn.President Bob Fisher taking the first car -- an 
antique -- across the bridge.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is the primary entryway to the Aliso Viejo community and the primary 
entrance to Pacific Park, a 900-acre business park in the middle of Aliso 
Viejo," said Wendy Harder, a spokeswoman for the Mission Viejo Co., which 
developed the Aliso Viejo planned community.  
</P>
<P>
 It took about three years and $3 million to complete the Pacific Park Drive 
extension between Alicia Parkway and Aliso Creek Road, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bridge will provide Aliso Viejo residents easier access to Laguna Niguel 
and Laguna Hills as well as to Interstate 5 and the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents impatient for the road's opening have already been seen testing the 
asphalt with their children's strollers. 
</P>
<P>
 Harder said that with the bridge's completion Aliso Viejo's arterial roads are 
about 95% complete. 
</P>
<P>
 The dedication ceremony also will include music by the Aliso Niguel High 
School band. LYNN FRANEY

 City Council candidates have so far reached deeply into their own pockets to 
fund their campaigns, according to candidate finance statements released last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest self-borrower: Larry Gilbert has loaned his campaign $6,450.He has 
vowed not to take contributions.  
</P>
<P>
 Personal loans accounted for more than half of the campaign war chests 
reported by five of the seven candidates running for three open council seats 
in the November city election. Only Mayor Susan Withrow is seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the $2,201 raised by Withrow came from her personal assets, although 
she loaned her campaign about $40,000 in 1990. Tom Potocki loaned himself 
$2,871 of the $6,381 in his campaign bank account. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherri Butterfield wrote checks totaling $5,531 of her $6,052 campaign 
balance. Larry Smith lent his campaign $3,000 of the $3,300 he has raised. 
Karen Irvine reported $1,003 of her $1,353 campaign total came from her 
husband, Bill Irvine. The entire $1,950 raised by Neil Lonzinger came from a 
self-loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Withrow has by far raised the most money, listing $13,288 in her campaign 
account. 
</P>
<P>
 Families for a Quality Mission Viejo, a political action committee supporting 
Withrow and Butterfield, raised $3,609. Otherwise, the most active contributor 
to council campaigns has been two trash companies and an ambulance firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Medix Ambulance Service, which was recently awarded the city ambulance 
franchise, gave $1,000 each to Families for a Quality Mission Viejo and 
Butterfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Waste hauler Browning Ferris Inc. gave $500 each to Families for a Quality 
Mission Viejo and Butterfield. The current city franchise, Waste Management, 
gave $500 each to Withrow and the Families for a Quality Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 The city waste hauling contract will expire next year. FRANK MESSINA

 The City Council has voted to increase the speed limit on one street and 
establish two new speed limits in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff recommended the changes to comply with a state law that requires 
enforceable speed limits be posted. 
</P>
<P>
 The speed limit on La Paz Road between Crown Valley Parkway and Rancho Niguel 
Road will increase from 40 to 45 m.p.h. A traffic survey found that the average 
speed there is 48 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 The new speed limits will be on Talavera Drive and a section of the newly 
extended Cabot Road. Cars will not be allowed to travel more than 30 m.p.h. on 
Talavera, or more than 45 m.p.h. on Cabot Road between Crown Valley Parkway and 
the city's northern boundary. 
</P>
<P>
 The traffic survey showed that the average speed on Cabot Road between Rapid 
Falls Road and the city limits is also 48 m.p.h. LYNN FRANEY

 If state funding comes through, officials with the county's Department of 
Harbors, Beaches and Parks hope to begin placing emergency call boxes along 
some local hiking trails. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emergency response system will make hikers and equestrians more 
comfortable using the more isolated areas of the county trails," said Richard 
Huffnagle, a supervising ranger with the parks department. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffnagle said the $45,000 in state trail enhancement funds needed for 15 call 
boxes should be approved within months. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the one-year pilot program, yellow emergency call boxes that 
automatically dial 911 when the door is opened would be set up along the Santa 
Ana River trail and in the Whiting Ranch and Aliso/Wood Canyons regional parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The boxes would contain cellular phones that would ring through to the Orange 
County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffnagle said he would like to see the boxes placed eventually in Ronald W. 
Caspers Regional Park, in the Anaheim Hills trail area and at beaches in Laguna 
Beach.LYNN FRANEY

RESIDENTS SEEK RELIEF FROM SANTA ANA WINDS AT BEACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE MARQUIS and GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a fall weekend, when beach-goers park their lounge chairs not just at 
water's edge but actually in the big blue drink, it's a clear signal that the 
Santa Ana winds are in town and people have become just tad desperate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a normal sight," said Huntington City Beach operations Lt. Steve 
Seim, who watched Sunday as parched people took to the ocean for relief from 
soaring temperatures and plunging humidity. 
</P>
<P>
 The feisty winds, bringing in desert air from the Great Basin states, pushed 
temperatures up to 99 degrees in Anaheim, 98 in Santa Ana and Lake Forest and 
the mid-80s in the beach cities, according to WeatherData Inc., which provides 
forecasts for the Times. Humidity was measured at 13% in Santa Ana, compared to 
a usual level of about 50% in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The heat didn't break the Orange County record -- which stands at 104 degrees 
in Santa Ana on Oct. 9, 1976 -- but it did drive tens of thousands of people to 
county beaches to enjoy the warm season's last gasps. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost too hot out here," said Awbrey Sottosant, 20, between sips of a 
64-ounce Coke she was sharing with her friend outside a pizza parlor near the 
San Clemente Pier Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been jumping into the water all day," she said. "It's a little cold in 
the ocean, but that's what we want." 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean temperatures hovered between 65 and 70 degrees, according to lifeguards' 
estimates -- not bad for October. But even for those who weren't inclined to 
take the plunge, the beach was the place to be. It was better, at least, than 
the stifling indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick and Anita Kennedy, in their 70s, fled their San Clemente house for a cool 
spot under a tree on a grassy hill near the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came down here to catch some of the breeze," Anita Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Winds in Santa Ana Sunday were estimated to be moving at about 10 m.p.h. The 
winds are expected to relent somewhat today, with high temperatures dropping to 
the upper 80s and low 90s, said WeatherData meteorologist Kris Farnsworth. The 
cooling trend will continue through Tuesday, he said, when temperatures are 
anticipated in the low to mid-80s. 
</P>
<P>
 The usual coastal fog and clouds are expected to return by Tuesday night, 
Farnsworth said.

2 SUSPECTS ARRESTED IN ANAHEIM BURGLARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aided by a police helicopter, two Los Angeles County men were arrested early 
Sunday on suspicion of burglarizing an Anaheim embroidery company, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Ruiz Lopez, 24, of Wilmington, and Fernando Lopez Estrada, 20, of 
Lynwood, were being held into Anaheim City Jail on suspicion of commercial 
burglary, said a spokesman for the Anaheim Police Department.Bail was set at 
$10,000 for each man. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began at 1:40 a.m. when the pilots of Angel, the Anaheim police 
helicopter, apparently saw a suspicious vehicle parked in the commercial area 
of Pacific Embroidery Co., in the 1100 block of Kraemer Boulevard, according to 
a police statement. When the two men left the building and got into the car, 
the helicopter pilots tracked them to an area near Center Street and Melrose 
Avenue in Placentia, where they parked and fled on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim police, with help from Fullerton and Placentia officers, found the men 
a short time later and arrested them without further incident, according to the 
report. No information was available on what was stolen.

 A man was in stable condition at UCI Medical Center in Orange Sunday after 
being shot in the chest earlier in the day, police said. 
</P>

 A mother and two daughters were injured Sunday morning as they escaped a fire 
in their two-story townhouse, fire officials reported. 
</P>

 Tam Dang, 26, was awakened shortly after 7 a.m. on the second floor of the 
condominium at 13934 Parkway Drive by her 2-year-old daughter, Dina Nguyen. 
Fire had broken out in the first-floor living room, according to a Garden Grove 
Fire Department news release. 
</P>
<P>
 Dang was unable to take Dina and her 4-year-old daughter, Gina Nguyen, down 
the stairs because of fire and smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 She ended up dropping the girls through the second-floor window into the arms 
of downstairs tenants who had been awakened by the family's shouting. The 
mother then jumped from the window, injuring her ankle.

IS FILMLAND IN SYNC WITH AMERICA?; LIBERALS STAY AWAY FROM A CONSERVATIVE 
CONFERENCE HONORING CHARLTON HESTON, WHILE DEBATE ENSUES ON WHETHER HOLLYWOOD 
JIBES WITH THE MAINSTREAM. 
</P>

<P>
 Organizers of a weekend conservative conference on Hollywood had hoped for 
some sharp discussions between conservatives and liberals over filmland's 
image-making machine. Instead, with scarcely a liberal to be seen, debate 
crackled between industry insiders and outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the outsiders, mainly pundits drawn from journalism, academia and 
politics, told the 250 participants at the Century Plaza Hotel that Hollywood 
was out of sync with mainstream America, that its images were too violent, too 
sexual and that they excoriated the pillars of society, religion, the family 
and the businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood's conservative elder statesman, Charlton Heston, was also feted at a 
Saturday evening tribute hosted by Rush Limbaugh. Other speakers included 
former Senate candidate Bruce Herschensohn and National Review editor John 
O'Sullivan, whose current issue features "The 100 Best Conservative Movies." 
The two days of seminars on "The Dream Factory and the American Dream: 
Hollywood and American Culture" were co-sponsored by the Center for the Study 
of Popular Culture and the National Review Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont, chairman of the National Review Institute, 
set the tone for the assault on Hollywood at the opening session. He railed 
against what he spelled out as "kulture smog . . . the misrepresentation of 
culture by its elites. To an awful lot of people, what you see on the screen 
seems out of touch with their daily lives." 
</P>
<P>
 "The language of the gutter has become the lingua franca of the screen," said 
Tony Thomas, an author and Canadian Broadcasting Corp. producer and host. "Sex 
and violence are a fact of life, but where do you draw the line at depicting 
them?" 
</P>
<P>
 But later, some industry conservatives defended Hollywood against suggestions 
of a liberal conspiracy and TV's decision-makers as mostly "suburban, 
bourgeois" family people. They said that what ends up on screens, large and 
small, is decided not by politics, but by the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never known a studio chief or network executive to approve anything 
without its demographic ducks in a row," Gerald McRaney ("Major Dad") told a 
panel on television's depiction of family life. "Usually people are, you should 
excuse the expression, conservative about what they put on." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox Inc. executive vice president George Vradenburg denied that Hollywood's 
view of America was largely debauched. He said the most violent show among TV's 
top 25 was "Monday Night Football" and noted the huge success of such family 
fare as "The Lion King" and TV's No. 1 show, "Home Improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 "We produce what will get audiences," he said. "We tend to reflect shared 
values. We're told we put out too many R-rated movies when G movies are more 
profitable. It's not true. R-rated movies are significantly more profitable. If 
movies are out of touch with America, why do Americans watch them?" 
</P>
<P>
 Vradenburg said in an interview later that Hollywood's critics didn't 
understand how the business worked. "Humor isn't political. Drama isn't 
political. I don't believe this crowd believes it. This business is driven by 
commercial considerations." 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives also differed over the oft-repeated "chicken-and-egg question" 
-- whether Hollywood was a lens through which society is viewed or a model that 
inspires behavior. The one panel that did have a self-proclaimed liberal, 
producer Bill Blinn ("Brian's Song"), was in harmony on the subject of 
censorship, with all decrying it. 
</P>
<P>
 The sharpest clash erupted between fellow conservatives -- film critic John 
Simon and author Arianna Huffington, wife of Republican senatorial candidate 
Michael Huffington. Huffington disputed Simon's contention that artistic 
greatness required "the freedom to offend," saying great art must have 
spiritual value. Simon, known for his acid pen and declaring "God is in the 
details," criticized the Greek-born Huffington's pronunciation of the word 
spiritual to a loud chorus of boos and hisses. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberals came in for some sharp criticism, too, in absentia. Robert Carnegie, 
founder and director of Playhouse West, said most actors and artists were 
liberal because they were emotionally injured in their youth and were "by 
nature deep feelers. . . . They go in the direction of their feelings. They are 
not deep thinkers." 
</P>
<P>
 Carnegie's views were contested by artists on subsequent panels. And Ronald 
Radosh, a history professor at Adelphi University, criticized films on the 
McCarthy era such as "Guilty by Suspicion" for depicting alleged communists as 
being "pure as ivory snow." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, the hearings were punitive . . . but most if not all of those summoned 
by the (House Un-American Activities Committee) were ardent Stalinists whose 
own sins exceeded those of their tormentors," he said.

FOR JASON STUART, HIS SEXUAL ORIENTATION'S A FULL-TIME JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE CHRISTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Actor-comedian Jason Stuart isn't the first performer to come out of the 
closet and announce that he's gay. He's only one of the more recent. But even 
though the heavy weather of persecution for sexual orientation has lifted 
somewhat in the '90s, his restless anxiety, his eagerness to please mixed with 
a wariness of being ridiculed, his sense of fun and his sense of fear, all 
point to the experience of being gay as a full-time vigil. 
</P>
<P>
 There's still the potential for culture clash that can erupt in a sudden 
glare. There's the tough double jeopardy of maintaining one's irreducible 
identity in a heterosexual world while living in a performer's skin, where 
self-esteem is treacherously vulnerable to the approval of others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I perceive myself differently than other people perceive me," he says. "When 
I was a kid, everyone thought I was jovial, funny. But I was one of those 
suicidal kids who went to sleep wishing I wouldn't wake up. It's very, very 
tiring, being in the closet. It makes you feel bad about yourself. When I don't 
see myself represented in movies or TV, it makes me feel there's no place for 
me in this world." 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart, 35, has been making his place since 1993, when he first decided to 
tell all to an audience at Houston's Laff Stop, then to the nation on 
"Geraldo." Later, he did his act on Broadway for the Gay Games, in "OUTrageous 
Comedy" with Sandra Bernhard.  
</P>
<P>
 As an actor, he has done a number of TV spots within the past year, on such 
shows as "seaQuest," "The John Larroquette Show" and "Murder, She Wrote." On 
Tuesday, he brings his "I'm Out . . . Jealous?" act to the Ice House in 
Pasadena for National Coming Out Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a year-and-a-half since I did 'Geraldo,' " Stuart muses. "The show 
was called 'Unconventional Comedians.' But what comedian is conventional? What 
are comedians but people who complain and get paid for it? I think this has 
made me a better person. And it may help some other kid who's thinking of 
killing himself. I'm not just out for me, I'm out for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart has such an outre , Auntie Mame demeanor that it's hard to picture him 
as ever having been repressed.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've lied to myself so much that I literally can't remember what went on in 
my life at times," he said, glancing out at the life moving along the busy 
street. "I guess that's part of being in denial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm easy, but I won't tell you everything. The family name is Greif. I was 
born in the Bronx, but my father moved us here to the Fairfax district when I 
was a year old. He's a self-made man who started in the necktie business, a 
Russian immigrant without formal education who's gifted at creating something 
from nothing. He married my mother when they were both very young. She was 
blond and buxom and very beautiful, the kind of '50s woman who knew she had to 
get by on looks."  
</P>
<P>
 Stuart's parents were divorced when he was 17. He's on guardedly friendly 
terms with them and with his older brother, but not with his younger sister, 
whom he mentions in his stand-up act. "She became an Orthodox Jew and had a 
baby I've never seen -- like if I hold him once he'll turn gay. I have the 
joke, 'What am I, Samantha on "Bewitched"?' I mean, what's the selling point? 
'We have no rights and everyone hates you. Join us.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Being gay had no frame of reference in Stuart's early youth. "I never equated 
having romantic feelings for men with being a fag or queer." He paused over the 
anomaly of those words. "All I know is, I was this fat Jewish kid. In junior 
high school I was 5'9" and 250 pounds. I didn't fit in anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Hell, said Sartre, is other people. If Stuart didn't know what to make of his 
feelings, there were others to oblige him. "In junior high, someone scraped, 
very lightly, the word fag on my locker. I never told anyone, but I saw that 
word every day for three years." 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart had always felt secure acting -- which he began doing in junior high. 
But there too he was lost in the shadow of himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always wanted to be a really good actor. First I thought I was Robert De 
Niro; then I thought I was Richard Thomas. That's how off I was. I was like 
Marlo Thomas in 'That Girl.' I thought all I had to do was show up and everyone 
would fall down. But I was still this fat Jewish kid." He peered at the 
reporter's notebook. "Don't say 'fat.' I'm thin now. This is coming out in the 
paper. Who knows? I'm gay." He gave a small, wry, anything-is-possible shrug. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart left home at 18 and tried to launch his acting career by sending his 
picture to every TV show he liked and by calling every agent in the Players 
Directory. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first agent was a woman named Tina Marie who had an office in back of a 
wig shop. She loved me, but she never sent me out on a job." It was just as 
well. Stuart knew he wasn't anywhere near ready when, as a panicked extra on 
the set of "One Day at a Time," he slammed the wrong door so hard that its 
molding fell off on camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart took a variety of odd jobs to support himself. "I was the world's 
rudest waiter," he recalls. "People loved it. If it was late and someone wanted 
a cup of coffee, I'd tell them to get it themselves. Once I threw a tray on the 
floor." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he went to work studying under a number of prestigious acting 
coaches -- Laurence Parke, Roy London, Nina Foch, Allan Miller and Harvey 
Lembeck among them. 
</P>
<P>
 He began to find work. "The Life and Times of Eddie Roberts" was his first TV 
show, and "Kindergarten Cop" was his first movie. He saw in comedy a way to 
balance his career, and he went out on the road in '85. In time he realized 
that he was sending mixed signals by playing it straight but "acting and 
dressing like Prince or Liberace with spiked hair. I didn't like what I was 
becoming. I wasn't telling the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 A small breakthrough began when Stuart, discussing self-esteem with school 
kids under the aegis of a program for young artists, was heckled for being gay 
one day and shot back, " 'I'm not gonna let you make me feel bad for being 
myself.' The teacher thanked me. I realized then that what I wanted out of life 
most was to be myself and to give back. I'm not the most talented or the most 
beautiful -- I'm Cher. I've discovered that the people who don't know gay 
people are the ones who don't like them." 
</P>
<P>
 * Stuart will appear with comedian Lynda Montgomery Tuesday at the Ice House, 
24 N. Mentor St . , Pasadena, (818) 577-1894. Show time, about 9 p.m. Cover 
charge, $7.50. He will also appear on a roster of gay and lesbian comics during 
a weeklong program for National Coming Out Day, Monday-Saturday at the Laugh 
Factory, 8001 Sunset Blvd., Hollywood, (213) 656-1336. Show time, 8 p.m. Cover 
charge, $8.

WHOSE LABOR OF LOVE IS 'LOVE AFFAIR'?; MOVIES: GLENN GORDON CARON IS THE 
DIRECTOR, BUT WARREN BEATTY GOT THE FINAL CUT. HOLLYWOOD GOSSIPS ARE ASKING WHO 
REALLY DID THE DIRECTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. WELKOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glenn Gordon Caron, the director of the soon-to-be-released Warren 
BeattyAnnette Bening movie "Love Affair," has heard the buzz going around 
Hollywood, and it bothers him. The rumor for weeks has been that Beatty -- not 
Caron -- really directed the film. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the director of this film," Caron insisted in an interview. "Under 
scrutiny, the rumors fall apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet as the Warner Bros.' release heads toward its Oct. 21 opening, it has 
become increasingly clear that "Love Affair" is not quite Caron's movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did Beatty produce, co-write (with Robert Towne) and star in the 
movie (with his actress wife Bening), he was given the "final cut" over the 
director in the editing room -- a rare contractual guarantee given to only a 
handful of powerful producers and stars. 
</P>
<P>
 That means that Beatty -- not Caron or Warner Bros. -- has the ultimate say 
over which version of the film will go to the theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Beatty is an accomplished director in his own right, having won an Academy 
Award for best director for his 1981 film "Reds," but industry observers agree 
it is a sensitive and potentially tension-provoking situation when a producer 
or star has final say over a director. The director is generally considered the 
creative force behind a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Beatty, asked Friday in a telephone interview about the arrangement, told The 
Times: "I don't believe in participating in that kind of analysis before a 
movie opens. 'Love Affair' is a picture that I like very much, made by the 
collaboration of extremely gifted people. I'm happy with it, and the director 
is happy with it. I don't see the point in elaborating." 
</P>
<P>
 Caron is perhaps best known as the creator and producer of the hit 1980s TV 
series "Moonlighting," which starred Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd. Caron 
made his feature-film directing debut with the powerful 1988 drama "Clean and 
Sober," starring Michael Keaton and released by Warner Bros. Last year, he 
directed "Wilder Napalm," a critical and box office flop. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview, Caron said he did not object to Beatty having final 
cut on "Love Affair," although he did not deny that there were times when the 
two did not see eye to eye. He explained: "I had my cut. We sat down together, 
looked at my cut, and there were a number of things he wanted to do. At a 
certain point, he pressed on. It became clear there were things we didn't agree 
on, that we were never going to come together on. He exercised his prerogatives 
to do those things he wanted. It was totally fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Caron added that, given Beatty's accomplishments, "it would be foolish not to 
at least listen. As the process continued, he had things he wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Caron would not elaborate on what the disagreements were about, but he added 
that they were "nothing of consequence, nothing of substance." 
</P>
<P>
 Beatty said: "It was my impression we didn't disagree on anything. . . . I've 
never wound up in a disagreement with any director I've produced a picture 
for." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Hollywood insiders, however, say Beatty's signature is all over the 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "The director wasn't even allowed in the editing room," said one high-profile 
agent, "and there's some question about who really directed this movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if Caron did in fact direct the movie, Beatty responded: "Of course; 
he's the director." 
</P>
<P>
 Had Beatty usurped his role as director, Caron said, people on the set would 
have noticed and "it would have become public very fast." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to determining whether a producer will get final cut, "a lot 
depends on the particular success of a director," the source said. For 
instance, Beatty did not have final cut on "Bugsy," in which he starred and was 
a producer, given Barry Levinson's stature as a director. 
</P>
<P>
 According to one prominent Hollywood lawyer: "There are a handful of powerful 
producers who have a contractual final cut behind a director of a certain 
level." Over the years, that select group has included such hyphenate 
filmmakers as Steven Spielberg, Sydney Pollack, Jim Brooks and Oliver Stone, 
who sometimes take off their director hats to produce other filmmaker's movies. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a few A-list actors such as Kevin Costner and Clint Eastwood can 
sometimes negotiate final-cut deals on movies they star in and produce. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different with every deal, and it really depends on who and what you're 
talking about," said one agent who represents top talent. As for producers 
getting final cut, he said that although it's not unprecedented, "it's not 
usual." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Directors Guild of America said that there is no blanket 
rule against allowing producers the final cut but that the DGA would not like 
to see it become a common practice. 
</P>
<P>
 DGA spokesman Chuck Warn said of Beatty: "He's a multiply talented individual 
who won an Oscar as a director and is one of the major movie stars of all time. 
In this situation, it's not a problem. If it became a practice where producers 
were attempting to go around the terms of the collective bargaining agreement 
and we saw it as a virus in the creative process, then the DGA would be on the 
scene." 
</P>
<P>
 Beatty has been in the forefront of efforts to strengthen the hand of 
directors. In 1985, for example, he won a significant artists' rights battle 
after ABC wanted to cut his "Reds" for a network showing, so that it would end 
in time for the late evening news. 
</P>
<P>
 The final-cut issue has stirred the passions of filmmakers for years. Only a 
dozen or so filmmakers have final-cut privileges written in their contracts; 
however, all directors are guaranteed cuts under the Directors Guild bargaining 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "As part of the contract, the director is allowed to cut his movie after it 
has been screened or previewed somewhere, and then, based on the audience 
reaction, he can make a second cut," one source said. "As a practical matter, 
what is happening is most directors are taking about three cuts to fine-tune 
their movies." 
</P>
<P>
 The studios usually retain the right to final cut, and directors fume if some 
studio executive steps in and invokes it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Love Affair" is a remake of the 1939 Leo McCarey movie starring Irene Dunne 
and Charles Boyer; it was followed by the 1957 classic "An Affair to Remember," 
starring Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.  
</P>
<P>
 The Beatty-Bening film involves a man and woman who fall unexpectedly and 
deeply in love while they're on a trip in the South Pacific, though both are 
engaged to others. When they return to the United States, they agree to have no 
contact with each other for three months, and then meet at the top of the 
Empire State Building. But Bening's character is injured on her way to the 
rendezvous and Beatty's character, not knowing what happened, assumes she chose 
not to honor her commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 Beatty wrote the script with Towne before Caron came on board in February of 
1993. According to published reports, Beatty originally wanted to direct the 
picture himself but opted for Caron so that he could work on "developing the 
characters to their potential" and his performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the big question in Hollywood circles remains: Why didn't Beatty just 
direct the movie to begin with? 
</P>
<P>
 Beatty, who is in New York on a press junket for "Love Affair," sidestepped 
the question Friday, saying he was dashing off to tape "Late Show With David 
Letterman."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: TELEVISION; A 'MASTERPIECE' IT ISN'T; PBS' NEW QUIZ SHOW 
DOESN'T LOOK TOO DIFFERENT FROM BRAND X 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here is the latest quiz-show scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Which television programming chief -- in rejecting the distinctive 
global-affairs series "Rights & Wrongs" for her network this year -- called 
human rights "an insufficient organizing principle" for a prime-time series? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Jennifer Lawson, executive vice president of national programming and 
promotional services for PBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the $64,000 question: Which network now has a prime-time quiz show? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: PBS. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, PBS -- whose mandate is to do serious, innovative programming 
in the public interest -- believes that a quiz show with prizes, a glib host 
and all the other formulaic aspects of this antique genre is a sufficient 
"organizing principle" for a prime-time series. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence is tonight's prime-time arrival (following the shallow, sound 
bite-driven, MTV-style premiere of "Future Quest," a series merging pop culture 
and science) of the PBS half-hour "Think Twice."  
</P>
<P>
 Announcer: "With the host of our show, a man who will make everyone think 
twice, Monteria Ivey." 
</P>
<P>
 Applause.  
</P>
<P>
 Ivey: "Thank you, thank you. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Subject to the whims of Congress because of its ongoing money problems, PBS 
survives by tiptoeing through minefields. It's nearly always in someone's cross 
hairs -- if not liberals claiming that it's too conservative, then 
conservatives charging that it's too liberal. 
</P>
<P>
 Presently, no one can accuse it of being too unique. 
</P>
<P>
 In part because of the options offered by cable's broadening multichannel 
smorgasbord, the gap between PBS and the rest of TV has been narrowing for 
years. Yet PBS itself appears a willing collaborator in this process at times, 
and the emergence of "Think Twice" may signal an especially defining moment.  
</P>
<P>
 As if game-show maven Merv Griffin himself were pulling PBS strings, now comes 
the kind of program that has epitomized routine commercial fare for decades. 
And notably, "Think Twice" is from WGBH of all places, the prestigious Boston 
station that presents "Masterpiece Theatre." 
</P>
<P>
 PBS has previously used game-show formats as an educational bridge within its 
science series, "Nova." Yet "Think Twice" is nothing more than public TV 
flat-out aping Brand X. 
</P>
<P>
 Will public stations now entice contributors during their droning pledge 
drives by boasting about "Think Twice," whose creative team's pedigree includes 
"The $64,000 Question," "Sale of the Century," "Hollywood Squares," "Wheel of 
Fortune," "Bumper Stumpers," "Let's Make a Deal," "Queen for a Day," 
"Concentration," "The $25,000 Pyramid," "Match Game," "Press Your Luck," "Card 
Sharks," "Name That Tune," "The Joker's Wild" and "Truth or Consequences"? 
</P>
<P>
 Advertised as being brainier than other game shows, "Think Twice" is only 
moderately challenging. Being dry and convoluted are all that separate it from 
its commercial siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 The game is split into information, imagination, intuition and bonus rounds, 
with Ivey -- listed in his bio as a stand-up comic -- reading questions to two 
teams of contestants standing behind panels equipped with buzzers. 
</P>
<P>
 How interchangeable is "Think Twice" with other game shows? This 
interchangeable: 
</P>
<P>
 Ivey to Chris, the announcer: "What do we have for our winners tonight?" 
</P>
<P>
 Chris: "Monteria, our winners will receive a mini-audio system from Kenwood 
with seven-disc CD changer dual cassette deck and FM/AM tuner, and a $500 gift 
certificate from Borders, where you can choose from over 150,000 book and music 
titles." 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, the bonus round gives each winner a shot at a $2,500 investment in a 
mutual fund, and losers are sent away with $500 in computer software products 
and a $250 gift certificate for Signals, a catalogue "for fans of public 
television." 
</P>
<P>
 One team tonight is former '60s flower children Demita and Sherman. Opposing 
them are Josh and Wesley, who look like Young Republicans. All listen intently 
to Ivey: "Every question will have two parts. Buzz in when you think you have 
the correct answer, but only answer half of the question, because your partner 
must answer the other half. Every question will be worth 10 points. Everybody 
ready?" Ready.  
</P>
<P>
 Ivey: "Their names differ by one letter. One is the highest mountain in 
Turkey. The other is the highest official in the PLO. Name them." 
</P>
<P>
 Buzz.  
</P>
<P>
 Sherman: "Ararat." 
</P>
<P>
 Ivey: "Which is the mountain. The PLO leader?" 
</P>
<P>
 Demita: "Arafat." 
</P>
<P>
 Ivey: "Which is correct, and you get the first 10 points of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that a single game show transforms all of PBS into "Hollywood Squares." 
When it comes to drama on PBS, the British-made "Prime Suspect" serials have 
been the equal of anything on the small screen. PBS still has the sanest, most 
thoughtful nightly newscast on TV in "The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour," and the two 
best documentary series in "Frontline" and "P.O.V." 
</P>
<P>
 It can still mount the occasional strong cultural or historical documentary, 
evidenced by last week's "National Geographic's China: Beyond the Clouds" and 
this week's "FDR" miniseries on "American Experience." And where but on PBS 
would the Red Sea part for Ken ("The Civil War") Burns, granting him heady 
freedom to make an 18 1/2-hour documentary about baseball that, although 
impressive in part, seemed to linger almost as long as Moses and his people did 
in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, just why did PBS give Burns such unprecedented carte 
blanche, a decision that now seems highly questionable given that ratings for 
"Baseball" -- although well above usual PBS levels -- did not approach the 
nightly audience totals for "The Civil War" despite a massive promotional 
effort? And if the explanation is that baseball is a less significant topic 
than the Civil War, then why was it seven hours longer? 
</P>
<P>
 And what of those nagging questions about PBS and its fading uniqueness? 
</P>
<P>
 One concerns the present phasing out of the much-admired PBS series "American 
Playhouse," for almost a dozen years the boldest venue for U.S. drama on all of 
TV. Collaterally, Armistead Maupin's proposed sequel to his "American 
Playhouse" offering of "Tales of the City" -- the most watched dramatic series 
on PBS in a decade -- was rejected, the network maintaining that the cost was 
unacceptable. PBS critics contend that the network bowed to pressure from 
conservatives objecting to the gay themes and casual drug use depicted in 
"Tales." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to diminished capacity, though, nothing is more symbolic than 
the gnarled aging of the signature series that for years has given PBS its 
broadest Union Jack banner. Although "The Rector's Wife" on Sunday began a 
three-episode "Masterpiece Theater" run superior to the previous week's feeble 
premiere, this once-gleaming PBS hood ornament remains strikingly corroded. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece British drama series on PBS is now "Mystery!" Good stuff on 
occasion. Yet its style of sleuthing is also available (albeit with 
commercials) on cable's Arts & Entertainment network. Just as the brand of 
nature documentaries that once helped define PBS are now more abundant on the 
Discovery Channel, and such other PBS trademarks as opera and morning kiddie 
shows are coming to Bravo and Nickelodeon, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that PBS isn't still capable of being distinctive or scintillating on 
a given day or night, only that those occasions are becoming less frequent. 
</P>
<P>
 PBS President Ervin S. Dugan recently spoke to The Times of his grand scheme 
for "The Democracy Project," a promising series of programs "illuminating 
issues and political processes" leading to the 1996 presidential election. He 
also said that "dignity, responsibility, professionalism, imagination, 
creativity will beat mere dollars anytime." 
</P>
<P>
 Tell that to the two teams competing for stock portfolios on the opening 
"Think Twice." Fighting tenaciously all the way to the exciting last question, 
they end the first three rounds only 10 points apart. As a bouncy theme plays 
over the end credits following the bonus round, Chris the announcer says, 
"Funding for 'Think Twice' is made possible by the Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting and by the annual financial support of viewers like you." 
</P>
<P>
 Think about it. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Think Twice" premieres at 8:30 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28, and at 7:30 
p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24. "Future Quest" premieres at 8 p.m. on Channel 28, 
and at 7 p.m. on KVCR.

<P>
 A 28-year-old Laguna Beach mezzo-soprano, Heidi Herzog, won first prize 
Saturday in the Orange County district Metropolitan Opera auditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Soprano Elizabeth Koukladas, 29, of Westminster, took second, while soprano 
Robin Lee Parkin, 30, of Fullerton, earned third.Seven singers competed at 
Chapman University. 
</P>
<P>
 For their efforts, Herzog won the $500 Orange County Philharmonic Society 
award, Koukladas the $300 James V. Powers award, and Parkin the $200 William 
John Conlin award. 
</P>
<P>
 In a precedent-shattering move, the three judges also gave Koukladas a $150 
Encouragement Award, which normally goes to someone not in the top three. This 
year, the award was named in honor of Nunzio Crisci, who co-founded the 
auditions 19 years ago with Florence R. Schumacher. Crisci died in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges were Geraldine Decker, a former Metropolitan Opera contralto and 
now a voice teacher in Oxnard; Erich Vollmer, executive director of the Los 
Angeles Chamber Orchestra and formerly executive director of the Orange County 
Philharmonic Society, and Roger Pines, director of education at the San Diego 
Opera. 
</P>
<P>
 The three Orange County singers will travel to the preliminary finals Nov. 10 
at USC. Ten winners from that competition will compete Nov. 11 at USC. Tickets: 
$15. Information: (213) 743-7111.

TBS HOSTS 'NATIVE AMERICANS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "We must make our own films and programs," Chickasaw artist Gary Whitedeer 
says of Native American people's efforts to spread the word about their 
history. And so they have, with TBS' "The Native Americans," which, at six 
hours over three evenings, is the biggest Native American-made television 
series ever. 
</P>
<P>
 So, is "The Native Americans" the work of Whitedeer's dreams? Only Whitedeer 
could answer, but it is a uniquely American document that encases all of the 
good and bad contradictions involved with being Indian in contemporary U.S. 
culture. The films themselves -- divided by region from Northeast to Southwest 
and made by three Native American directors -- are sometimes unaware of those 
contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
 History is always made by the historians, and though filmmakers John Borden, 
Phil Lucas and George Burdeau try to recapture a neglected history, their 
project is still informed by the conqueror's point of view. Loads of archival 
footage and photographs were shot by white men, and the music score by Robbie 
Robertson and other Native musicians (though beautiful on the available CD 
recording) is jarringly contemporary in a program sympathetic to traditional 
ways. The series doesn't analyze the then-now dilemma of Native Americans in 
high-tech America; rather, the series embodies it. 
</P>
<P>
 The alternative "ritual" here is a number of circular gatherings of 
representatives of tribes in each region. Men and women, some priests, others 
with Harvard degrees, discuss both regional tribal history and the ongoing 
struggle to preserve traditional ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the complex and deeply tragic story of the Plains Indians is given two 
hours alone (the four other regions are allotted one each), the Plains 
gathering is the most effective. From Darrell Kipp's study of Blackfoot 
language ("without it, we become a static, museum culture") to the feminism of 
Lakota Charlotte Black Elk, this is a group marrying 1990s modernism with 
traditionalist fervor. 
</P>
<P>
 That marriage, however, is not always so easy in Native American life today. 
The ongoing struggle between "progressives" (typically pro-business and 
pro-technology) and "traditionalists" (skeptical of progress and intent on 
preserving ancient religious values and practices) is never told in "The Native 
Americans," though it's one of the most unfortunate legacies of the contact 
with the White Man. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Native Americans" airs at 5:05 and 7:05 p.m. today, Tuesday and 
Thursday on cable's TBS.

TOBACCO GIANT QUIETLY PUSHES PROP. 188 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a state that has led all others in attempts to snuff out smoking, the 
nation's largest cigarette maker is taking the bold step of pushing a voter 
initiative that would make it easier for smokers to light up. 
</P>
<P>
 With its Proposition 188 on the Nov. 8 ballot, tobacco giant Philip Morris USA 
hopes to become the latest big business to use California's initiative process 
to turn its goals into law. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a very difficult, uphill fight," said Lee Stitzenberger, the Westwood 
political consultant entrusted by Philip Morris with convincing Californians 
that smoking policy should be guided by a cigarette manufacturer. Difficult, 
but not impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Improbable as it may seem in California, where fewer than one in five people 
smoke, Proposition 188 exhibits signs of life. Public opinion polls show that 
the race is close. The tobacco industry is outspending the vote-no-on-188 
forces by a margin of 28 to 1. The opponents consist primarily of health 
groups, doctors and anti-smoking activists, who are having a hard time 
attracting attention -- essential for countering the strategy employed by 
Stitzenberger and Philip Morris. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Philip Morris') plan is to be low-profile," said Jack Nicholl, the Los 
Angeles consultant for the No on 188 campaign. "Don't create any controversy . 
. . then slip in in the dark of night, with an ignorant electorate. It's a 
smart tactic based on weakness. The weakness is that the sponsorship is not 
tolerated by the voting public." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 188 would reverse a decade-long trend in California, returning to 
restaurants and other businesses the right to permit smoking in ventilated 
sections. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative would erase local smoking bans from Los Angeles to Redding, and 
prevent cities from regulating tobacco use in the future. The initiative also 
collides head-on with a bill passed by the Legislature that would be the 
nation's strongest statewide smoking restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Signed into law by Gov. Pete Wilson earlier this year, the statewide ban will 
go into effect in January -- unless Proposition 188 passes, in which case the 
initiative takes precedence. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation signed by Wilson would ban smoking in most indoor workplaces 
-- restaurants, malls, offices, factories among them. It would prohibit smoking 
in bars by 1999, unless the state can develop standards to guard against the 
ill effects of secondhand smoke. The law also would permit cities to pass even 
tougher smoking ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 Since none of that was considered good for its business, Philip Morris fought 
back with the initiative, paying $1.8 million to place it on the ballot in a 
petition drive that brought charges of fraud by anti-smoking forces -- charges 
at which Stitzenberger scoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 While other tobacco companies are belatedly joining the effort by donating 
money, Philip Morris remains Proposition 188's prime backer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a business interest in ensuring that our customers are treated 
equitably," said David Laufer, a Philip Morris executive in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris is a New York-based conglomerate that makes Marlboro, the 
world's best-selling cigarette, and claims a 40%-plus share of cigarette sales 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The company emphasized its interest in Proposition 188 in a September letter 
to its stockholders, declaring that the initiative's passage is of "paramount 
importance to our customers, our employees and you, our stockholders," and 
saying it is needed to block the statewide ban from going into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 With four weeks to go before the election, Stitzenberger has spent $5 million 
of Philip Morris' billions. The next-largest donor, R. J. Reynolds, which makes 
Camel cigarettes, has given $1.6 million. Other tobacco companies have given a 
combined $1.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the end of September, the Yes on 188 effort had raised $7.8 million. A 
relative handful of restaurant and bar owners and others have given a total of 
less than $2,500. Stitzenberger predicts that the campaign will not cost more 
than $10 million, but says he has no plans to air high-priced television spots, 
and may not go on radio -- although "that could change." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Stitzenberger plans to run a "cerebral" campaign to "educate" voters. 
His message is that Proposition 188 is a reasonable compromise between smokers 
and nonsmokers. He intends to make heavy use of direct mail, the theme of which 
is that voters should read the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people understand what's in the initiative, and get away from all the 
hype, they'll see it is a fair, balanced, reasonable solution," he said. "We 
believe a majority of voters believe in some measure of business choice." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not clear, however, that even careful readers of the voting pamphlet 
would pick up on some of the nuances in Proposition 188. The initiative says, 
for example, that smoking would be permitted in business establishments that 
meet ventilation standards. 
</P>
<P>
 It does not explain the standards, except to say they must be in accord with 
"ASHRAE Standard 62-1989," a reference -- not explained in the initiative -- to 
a trade organization in Atlanta called the American Society of Heating, 
Refrigeration and Air-Condition Engineers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 As it happens, the tobacco industry helped draft the ASHRAE standard and, 
since 1988, ASHRAE has received $16,600 from Philip Morris, executives in the 
trade group told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineer John Janssen, who chaired the committee that wrote the standard in 
1989, said it was designed to spare people from the odors of tobacco smoke and 
other indoor pollutants, not from ill effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Janssen said in a telephone interview, the tobacco industry paid 
for at least one committee member to attend the meetings leading to the 
standard. A second member had done tobacco-funded research, and pushed tobacco 
industry views, Janssen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had gone to the tobacco industry and asked them to contribute somebody for 
the committee," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The No on 188 campaign consists of health groups such as the California arms 
of the American Cancer Society, American Heart Assn. and American Lung Assn. 
and business groups such as the California Restaurant Assn. and the California 
Labor Federation. The Mormon church also has come out against the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The three health groups have given a combined $111,000. The California Medical 
Assn., among the largest campaign spenders, has given $21,000, and the 
California Dental Assn. has given $31,000 toward the defeat of Proposition 188. 
Most hospital corporations and health insurance companies are pledging their 
political war chests to defeat other initiatives on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm grateful for what (donors) have given, but it's not enough," Nicholl 
said. "They don't see it as their top priority. But they're going to hate it if 
they have to live with the results. It will put smoke in their face." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholl said he expects to have less than $600,000 for the No campaign -- he 
has raised $257,000 so far -- a paltry sum in California politics. He hopes to 
have enough money to air some radio spots in which former Surgeon General C. 
Everett Koop blasts the initiative. But with little money, and given 
Stitzenberger's decision to remain low-key, the No on 188 effort is struggling. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to draw attention, opponents held a news conference last week, bringing 
several public officials to the Alameda County Courthouse in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 So television crews would have something to videotape, the organizers brought 
a 10-foot-long "cigarette" stuffed with what looked like shredded money. The 
plan was to stomp on it in front of television cameras. But when only one radio 
reporter and a camera crew from a Spanish language station showed up, the 
initiative's foes ended up saving the "visual" for another day. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood), who authored the now-threatened 
statewide smoking ban due to go into effect in January, is alarmed by the 
campaign being waged by opponents of Proposition 188. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, I haven't seen much evidence of the (No on 188) campaign," he said. 
"I hope that there is a strategic plan. I'm not aware if there is one or not. . 
. . It would be the ultimate irony that this struggle in Sacramento was wiped 
out because a special interest took advantage of the initiative." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, part of the Yes on 188 campaign, called Californians for Statewide 
Smoking Restrictions, is aimed at nonsmokers. Stitzenberger's mailers talk 
about the need for statewide tobacco regulation, proclaim that Proposition 188 
would create one of the toughest smoking laws in the nation, and tout elements 
of the initiative aimed at making it harder for minors to buy cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 If the initiative fails and Friedman's smoking ban goes into effect, 
California will have overdone it with "de facto prohibition," Stitzenberger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a burning issue," he said. "This is not the biggest concern 
people have in the world. They have a lot of concerns that rank a whole lot 
higher than whether there is a separate smoking section." 
</P>
<P>
 On the coffee table in Stitzenberger's Westwood office is the book "Thank You 
for Smoking," a witty and biting satire of the tobacco industry. Through much 
of the book, the main character battles "Health Nazis" and attacks scientific 
data pointing to the risks of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Stitzenberger hasn't read it yet. But he could be one of its characters. He 
derides Health Nazis, and scoffs at "irrational ravings of the opposition." He 
smokes occasional cigars, although he says his wife makes him light up on the 
deck, and terms as "garbage" studies showing that tobacco smoke can harm 
nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Stitzenberger and his firm, the Dolphin Group, ran the 1986 campaign that 
resulted in the unprecedented defeat of California Chief Justice Rose Bird and 
two other Supreme Court justices. In that campaign, he and his partners 
organized a group called Crime Victims for Court Reform, which drew on mothers 
and fathers of murdered children who opposed the liberal Bird court. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Stitzenberger produced a video of Willie Horton's victims. Their 
descriptions of Horton's vicious attacks was a powerful attack on former 
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in his 1988 run for the presidency. 
Stitzenberger produced the video as part of an independent effort to aid George 
Bush's election. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the No on 188 campaign hopes to make use of "tobacco victims" to defeat 
Stitzenberger. He takes umbrage at the description. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't acknowledge that exists," he said. "You make choices in your life -- 
whether you choose to drink or not drink, smoke or not smoke, have wild 
abandoned sex. . . . We all make judgments in our life."

NEWS ANALYSIS; U.S. WOULD FIRST RELY ON AIR POWER IN GULF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States does not have sufficient military forces in Kuwait to stop 
Iraqi troops on the spot if they invade Kuwait today or Tuesday, and it hopes 
to use air power to deter any attack at least until more U.S. troops arrive, 
military analysts said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has only about 3,000 ground troops in the area -- a force 
that would be far outnumbered by the nearly 70,000-member contingent that Iraq 
has assembled near the Kuwaiti border. 
</P>
<P>
 And even though President Clinton has approved plans to send up to 38,000 
troops by the end of the week, defense analysts say the United States does have 
enough aircraft and missiles on hand in the region to damage the Iraqi force 
severely and to retaliate against other targets if Baghdad launches an attack. 
</P>
<P>
 But they say Washington will have enough troops on the ground by midweek to 
repel any Iraqi invasion with a combination of armored and air forces, despite 
the lopsided advantage the Iraqis have in troop strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon strategists are betting that Iraq would not be able to launch a 
full-scale invasion before late this week, after it has put the logistics 
arrangements in place needed to sustain such an operation, and they say U.S. 
forces will be fully ready by then. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal (for the next few days) is to deter any Iraqi invasion," a Pentagon 
official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts question whether air power alone could successfully stop the 
nearly 70,000 troops who are assembled eight miles from the Kuwaiti border. By 
almost any measure, Iraqi forces could easily cross the border into Kuwait 
today or Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials have been approaching the issue of U.S. readiness gingerly. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Marine Corps Lt. Gen. John Sheehan, operations director for the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, declined to say specifically whether existing U.S. 
forces could actually block an immediate Iraqi push. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he noted that the United States has 200 Tomahawk cruise missiles in 
the area, which could hit Baghdad easily. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein does something, we can punish those 
forces," he said carefully -- punish , but not necessarily defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry took a similar tack Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to forecast a day-by-day account of how a battle would go, 
because that would depend on how quickly they decided to go in, how far a 
buildup had proceeded," he told the CBS program "Face the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts say the initial U.S. disadvantage would evaporate quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the case in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the ground troops that the 
Pentagon is assembling in Kuwait will be able to hit the deck running -- 
because their tanks and equipment already are in the country, having been 
stored there in case of an Iraqi resurgence. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon analysts say Hussein faces something of a trade-off: He could attack 
Kuwait now without full preparations, hoping to succeed briefly before his 
troops ultimately were destroyed by U.S. forces, or build up further and risk a 
stronger U.S. force. 
</P>
<P>
 He also might simply leave his troops near the border, hoping to force the 
United States into taking the first step in hopes that it would lose some face. 
Perry hinted Sunday that Washington most likely would attack rather than let 
Iraqi troops stay there indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony H. Cordesman, a Georgetown University military analyst, said the 
initial stages of any such battle would probably be a contest between "our 
(U.S.) air and missile power and their land power" -- and Iraq could not 
sustain that test for long. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Iraqi forces have rebounded somewhat from their defeat in the Gulf 
War, they face some formidable problems: They still have no real air power, 
either to provide close air support for troops or to attack U.S. positions. And 
they are not good at ground maneuvering. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, U.S. forces are far more lethal than they were in 1991, with 
greatly improved ability to attack at night and to launch precision-guided 
munitions. And, thanks to the Gulf War, U.S. troops are now experienced desert 
fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wouldn't be anything like the last (ground) operation (in 1991), and no 
doubt we'd have a little more difficulty" without massive numbers of U.S. 
troops, said retired Army Col. Raoul Alcala, a former Pentagon strategist. "But 
there's no doubt that U.S. forces could do the job." 
</P>
<P>
 There are other advantages for the allied side. Unlike the situation in 1991, 
U.S. officials are reacting quickly, in time to get forces to the region early. 
And Washington does not have to spend time trying to win permission to use 
bases in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Cordesman said that although no one can predict confidently that 
the Iraqis would never make it to Kuwait City, their victory would be 
short-lived because the Iraqi invasion force would soon be wiped out. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert H. Gaskin, a former Pentagon military strategist now with Business 
Executives for National Security, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have the logistics situation ready for a long push," he said. "If 
they put that force out in the desert, they'd just get knocked to pieces." 
</P>
<P>
 There were about 12,000 U.S. service personnel in the Persian Gulf region 
Sunday -- the 3,000 ground troops plus aircraft crews and naval personnel. An 
additional 4,300 soldiers and Marines were arriving Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said U.S. arms-storage facilities in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait contain 
enough GBU-10 and GBU-12 "smart bombs" to destroy between 3,000 and 4,000 
tanks, plus 15,000 cluster bombs, adequate 30-millimeter cannon rounds and 
20,000 large Mark 82 500-pound conventional bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the United States has more than a dozen cargo ships loaded with 
weapons and equipment for ground troops that might be sent to Kuwait. A 
squadron based on the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean is already en 
route to the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is expected to build up its forces rapidly over the next few 
days. About 4,000 additional Army troops were on their way to Kuwait on Sunday 
from Ft. Stewart, Ga. And officials say Clinton will deploy 18,000 Marines from 
Camp Pendleton, Calif. Others will follow, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has also deployed several more squadrons of U.S. warplanes -- 
including 24 A-10 Warthog antitank aircraft -- to Saudi Arabia to bolster 
existing Air Force and Navy fighters and bombers now in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 But Georgetown's Cordesman cautioned that most analysts so far have been 
viewing the situation through a Western prism, assuming Hussein is trying to 
bully the United Nations into lifting economic sanctions against Iraq, and 
missing the point that his defiance of Western powers is making him a hero at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prospect of martyrdom (among Arab leaders) is something you cannot 
dismiss," he said.

PLAN TO EXPAND LAPD FALLING SHORT OF GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ambitious plan to expand the size of the Los Angeles Police Department by 
nearly 40% over five years has fallen behind schedule, with the department 
growing at only about half the rate that Mayor Richard Riordan and Police Chief 
Willie L. Williams had projected a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A larger Police Department has become the central preoccupation of the city's 
political leadership, but the LAPD has grown by only 192 officers to 7,792, 
short of the gain of about 388 officers that had been projected by now, a 
review by The Times has found. 
</P>
<P>
 Other goals stated in the city's "Project Safety Los Angeles" -- including 
expanded overtime payments to put more officers on street patrols -- have also 
produced less than half of what was projected. 
</P>
<P>
 The shortfalls have led the mayor's office to privately increase pressure on 
Williams for more progress. Councilwoman Laura Chick has asked the LAPD brass 
to report later this month on the issue to the council's Public Safety 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know we're not on target," Chick said. "I'm concerned with our progress, 
and I don't believe we can wait until the end of the year (for a status 
report). We need to know all along how we are doing." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's office and Police Department officials acknowledge that some 
interim goals in the plan are lagging, but they say that the final projections 
can be met by the end of the expansion in July, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 "We agree that the Police Department is behind on some of its goals," said 
William C. Violante, the mayor's deputy for public safety. "But this is a 
five-year plan, and we can still be where we want to be at the end of five 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, front-line police supervisors said they are seeing the first 
positive impacts of the public safety plan. Several watch commanders said they 
have been able to use increased overtime payments to add patrols. The addition 
of just one patrol car can make a noticeable difference in police divisions 
that are sometimes patrolled by as few as six squad cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The police buildup had its genesis in the 1993 mayoral race in which Riordan 
campaigned primarily on a promise to add 3,000 officers to the LAPD in four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, after little more than three months in office, Riordan stood in 
front of rows of blue-clad officers at the Police Academy to unveil a slightly 
less ambitious proposal. In that plan, called Project Safety Los Angeles, 
Riordan said he would find the money to increase the 7,600-member force by 
2,855 officers over five years. He said the equivalent of 1,480 more police 
officers could be put on the streets by moving desk officers into the street 
and paying cash overtime to reduce the large number of officers who are 
typically off duty on compensatory time. 
</P>
<P>
 To pay for the buildup, Riordan designed -- and the City Council approved -- a 
variety of budgeting maneuvers that expanded Police Department funding by about 
$100 million over 18 months, not counting money for pay raises this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the public safety plan has run into problems, in large part because of its 
overly optimistic prediction that the flow of officers leaving the LAPD could 
be quickly stanched. 
</P>
<P>
 While the LAPD has lost an average of about 400 officers a year since 1980, 
the plan projected that the force would lose just 365 officers in fiscal year 
1993-94 and only 330 a year after that. In fact, officers are continuing to 
leave at the rate of about 400 a year, said Cmdr. Dan Watson, head of the 
department's Personnel Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams and Riordan had devised a series of steps that they hoped would slow 
retirements and resignations, but some of those are just getting off the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of a three- or four-day workweek has been cited as one of the main 
reasons that LAPD officers move to neighboring suburban departments. In 
January, four of 18 LAPD geographic divisions will begin a yearlong pilot 
program to put officers on alternative schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite this year's 7% pay raise and attendant bonuses, LAPD officers 
still make less than their counterparts in many other Southern California law 
enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "A big part of the issue is compensation," said the LAPD's Watson. "We are no 
longer highly competitive in the law enforcement field. People can leave here 
and go to a place where it's nicer to live, that is less expensive and work a 
lesser workload and do it for the same or more money. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to look someone in the eye and say they should stay, under those 
conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem of flight to other police departments has been exacerbated, LAPD 
officials said, because officers are no longer required to serve at least 20 
years to become entitled to at least a portion of their pension benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 But the LAPD's personnel office and Riordan's deputies said they believe that 
the number of officers leaving the LAPD should begin to drop because of a 
number of factors: the impending availability of modified work schedules; the 
purchase of new equipment, including the recent acquisition of 330 new squad 
cars, and the increased availability of cash to pay officers for their 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayoral Chief of Staff William Ouchi acknowledged that to decrease attrition, 
the city government will have to find even more money to raise police salaries. 
"That is something that must be done," Ouchi said. "What will happen to our 
city if we don't?" 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of veteran officers has not been the only problem for the police 
expansion. New hiring has also hit stumbling blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the department canceled one Police Academy class because most of 
the hiring and training staff had been diverted to emergency field duties after 
the Northridge earthquake. Thirteen classes of 60 recruits each were required 
this year to meet the plan's objectives. 
</P>
<P>
 And the LAPD's effort to hire officers from other police department has mostly 
failed. The department hoped to pick up 280 "lateral transfers" over four 
years, but has hired less than 20 in the year since the plan was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "They aren't exactly pounding down our door," said one LAPD official, noting 
that many of the applicants have tarnished records with their current police 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Department officials said they believe that the hiring shortfall can be 
made up over five years, in part by speeding the entry of new recruits. The 
department believes that it will be able to open a second Police Academy in 
Westchester at the start of 1995, augmenting the current facility in Elysian 
Park. That would be six months ahead of schedule, allowing 80 new officers to 
enter training each month, instead of 60. 
</P>
<P>
 In laying out the public safety plan, Riordan and Williams promised to make 
better use of the officers already on the force, in an effort to correct 
chronically low deployment levels. A Times survey two years ago found that an 
average of just 315 officers in 175 squad cars patrolled the city during a 
typical eight-hour shift. 
</P>
<P>
 The public safety plan proposes putting more officers on the street, in part 
by hiring civilians to take over jobs now filled by uniformed officers -- such 
as clerks, secretaries and budget analysts. 
</P>
<P>
 But the "civilianization" program has so far replaced only about 61 officers 
with civilians, about half of what the safety plan had projected by this time. 
The delay was caused by the late introduction and approval of the program by 
the City Council, peculiarities of the city's Civil Service system, and the 
extended training period for many of the civilians who have been hired. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the hiring of the first replacement civilians only in 
May, seven months after the plan was introduced to the public. Since then, the 
Police Department has had no problem hiring civilians to replace police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 But a new civilian employee can't simply be moved into a job such as answering 
phones at an LAPD division. The city's Civil Service "bumping" rules require a 
more complicated procedure that first offers the new jobs to the department's 
veteran civilian employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these civilian workers, called police service representatives, answer 
the department's 911 calls and can't be moved to replace police officers until 
new 911 operators have been trained. That can take eight to nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the greatest contributors to the notoriously low deployment levels in 
the LAPD has been the department's inability to pay officers cash for their 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 For many years, the city budget covered only about one-third of the Police 
Department's overtime demands. As a result, officers were required to take 
compensatory time off for working extra hours, removing dozens of officers from 
the street on any given day. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan proposed paying all overtime in cash, to return the equivalent of more 
than 400 officers a day to active duty in fiscal year 1993-94 and double that 
in the current fiscal year. But the plan has fallen short in this regard too. 
</P>
<P>
 While Riordan and the City Council were able to engineer an increase in the 
overtime budget by more than 2 1/2 times, they could not muster the quadrupling 
of overtime funding that the mayor had initially proposed. About $27 million 
that was to go toward extra police duty instead had to be diverted to police 
pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
 By paying the extra hours, the department estimates that it put the equivalent 
of 190 more officers on duty, said Al Beuerlein, head of the LAPD's Fiscal 
Support Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 That does not live up to projections twice that size, but the additional 
troops have been a welcome relief to police watch commanders -- the front-line 
supervisors who have struggled to field adequate forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Jack Ahrens of the San Fernando Valley's Devonshire Division said the 
extra overtime often allows for the addition of one more patrol unit to the 
about eight that he usually has on duty during the evening shift. Or sometimes 
an extra car might be used for a special detail -- for instance, to survey an 
area that has been the focus of a spate of burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "That may be a small percentage increase, but we can really notice a 
difference in response time," said Ahrens, who added that no statistics are yet 
available to back up his observation. 
</P>
<P>
 In South-Central's Newton Division, Sgt. Paul McConnell reported a similar 
experience. He said that he used to routinely get calls from Police Department 
operators, saying that unanswered calls for service were stacking up. "That 
does not happen hardly at all now on my watch," said McConnell. "It used to 
happen all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Westside's Pacific Division, Sgt. Andrew Smith has as many as two more 
cars on patrol than a year ago. "I can only say we need even more," said Smith. 
"But it's definitely a step in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Top mayoral aide Ouchi said he is in a "normal state of healthy anxiety" about 
the progress of the safety plan. He said there is no need for dismay, as 
preparations are being laid for more growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like an iceberg, what's visible is maybe not that much," said Ouchi. "But I'm 
confident that beneath the surface, what is being accomplished is very 
substantial." Expanding the Force 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and Police Chief Willie L. Williams 
announced a program a year ago to add 2,855 officers to the 7,600-officer Los 
Angeles Police Department over five years. The LAPD has grown by only half the 
number of officers it was projected to have by this month.

CLINTON APPROVES 38,000 TROOPS TO COUNTER IRAQ; MIDEAST: HUSSEIN IS CONTINUING 
TO MASS FORCES NEAR THE KUWAITI BORDER, THE PRESIDENT IS TOLD BY ADVISERS. THE 
PENTAGON ALSO ORDERS COMBAT AIRCRAFT TO THE AREA.

<P>
 President Clinton, rushing to head off a continued Iraqi troop buildup that 
could presage another invasion of Kuwait, approved plans Sunday designed to 
send up to 38,000 U.S. ground troops -- and hundreds of aircraft -- to the 
region by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 The decisions were disclosed after a meeting at the White House among Clinton 
and his top national security advisers at which the President was told that 
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was continuing to mass more troops near the 
Kuwaiti border. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Department officials said the additional troops to be sent would 
include the remainder of the 18,000-troop 1st Marine Expeditionary Force at 
Camp Pendleton, Calif., and the 16,000-soldier 24th Mechanized Infantry 
Division at Ft. Stewart, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 Advance elements of both those units, made up of 300 Marines and 4,000 
soldiers, left for Kuwait on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the Pentagon still has not issued formal orders to deploy the 
rest but that the President has approved plans to do so early this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon also ordered a spate of additional U.S. combat aircraft to Saudi 
Arabia, including 24 A-10 attack planes, 18 F-16 fighters and nine F-15C 
fighters, along with 14 C-130 transport aircraft from Pope Air Force Base in 
North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 And U.S. officials said Clinton is also considering options that include 
sending another, unspecified Army division made up of 16,000 more soldiers, 
B-52 bombers and F-117A Stealth fighters, which wreaked havoc on Iraqi forces 
during the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase to 38,000 ground troops by the end of the week would mark the 
largest number of troops that the United States has deployed to the Persian 
Gulf region since the 1991 war. By comparison, Washington has about 20,000 
soldiers and Marines in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior defense official said Clinton's immediate objective is to deter Iraq 
from invading Kuwait in a reprise of its 1990 incursion. If that effort fails, 
he said, the United States will use its forces to defeat the Iraqi forces as 
quickly and painlessly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said U.S. intelligence reports showed that Iraq was continuing its 
buildup despite U.S. warnings over the weekend, with two divisions of Iraq's 
elite Republican Guard pushing closer to the Kuwaiti border and other forces 
clearly on the move. Nearly 70,000 Iraqi troops are believed to be massing near 
the border. 
</P>
<P>
 They said satellite and air-reconnaissance photos had also shown that Iraqi 
forces were beginning to deploy a third division of the Republican Guard south 
to join the two others near the border -- a move that would bring the total 
Iraqi force to more than 80,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
 At the White House, National Security Adviser Anthony Lake told reporters that 
an estimated 16,000 of the Iraqi troops were poised within 1.2 miles of the 
demilitarized zone separating Iraq from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior defense official conceded that despite intensive reconnaissance 
efforts, U.S. analysts still have not determined for sure if Iraq intends to 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said that with these preparations, "Iraq could be ready in a matter of 
days . . . if it chooses." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest U.S. moves intensified a drama that began last week, when Iraq 
began moving unusual numbers of troops toward the Kuwaiti border in what some 
U.S. analysts said was a bid to bully the West into easing post-Gulf War U.N. 
sanctions that have hurt Iraq's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the U.N. Security Council had been scheduled to vote on Baghdad's 
appeal to lift the sanctions today, the United States had opposed the move, and 
the sanctions were expected to remain in force indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said the United States already has about 4,000 troops in 
Kuwait or offshore on amphibious warships. And, on Clinton's order, the 
aircraft carrier George Washington, two Aegis cruisers, a destroyer and two 
submarines are heading toward the Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 As Clinton reviewed Pentagon war plans, the Administration stepped up a major 
diplomatic effort to revive the allied coalition that joined with U.S. forces 
during the 1991 Gulf War, with officials consulting with their counterparts in 
Britain, France and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Kuwait, which placed its forces on alert Friday, moved the bulk of 
its 18,000-member army up to the Iraqi border to help serve as a first line of 
defense if an invasion comes. And Saudi Arabia pledged cooperation in using its 
bases as staging areas. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, Iraq said Sunday that it is seeking a diplomatic solution to the 
current crisis with the United Nations but asserted that it will insist on 
guarantees of a quick end to Gulf War sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign Minister Mohammed Said Sahaf said in a statement carried by the Iraqi 
News Agency that France, China and Russia were working in that direction, but 
he warned that Baghdad would accept nothing short of assurances that "the 
suffering of the Iraqi people" would end. 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq also moved hundreds of people to the Kuwaiti border, apparently to stage 
demonstrations, according to U.N. officials. Iraq said they had been displaced 
after the Gulf War, but Kuwaiti officials said they were soldiers in civilian 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to increase the U.S. troop strength in the Persian Gulf area was 
accompanied by a round of stern warnings from top Administration officials, who 
took to the airwaves Sunday to caution Iraq that the United States means 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main message . . . to Saddam Hussein is: 'Do not make a mistake. Do not 
cross that border. Do not create circumstances that will force us to act,' " 
Madeleine Albright, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said on CNN. 
</P>
<P>
 And Defense Secretary William J. Perry asserted that Iraqi forces would be 
roundly defeated if they tried to invade Kuwait. He also warned on the CBS-TV 
program "Face the Nation" that U.S. forces will attack -- not just "sit there" 
waiting -- if Iraq keeps its troops near the border indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in Jerusalem to help spur the 
Arab-Israeli peace process, also raised the possibility that the United States 
might not pressure Israel to stay out of the war this time -- as it did in 1991 
-- if Iraq invades again. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides sending additional combat units, the Pentagon also sent two more 
highflying U-2 spy planes and two RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft to the region 
to enable U.S. intelligence officers to track the Iraqi force more closely. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials believe that Iraq is not likely to launch any invasion 
until later this week, after it has put into place the logistics arrangements 
that it will need to support a serious military action, and by that time U.S. 
forces should be in place to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States already had about 12,000 military personnel in the Persian 
Gulf region before the weekend's increases were announced. These included 2,000 
Marines on amphibious ships off Kuwait; 1,200 soldiers; 3,900 Air Force 
personnel; 4,600 sailors on naval vessels in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, and 
170 special operations troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Although intelligence officials concede they have no definite reading on why 
Hussein has ordered the troop buildup, they say Washington must prepare for the 
worst if it is to prevent him from invading Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to remember that the last time we received a very clear warning that 
he was developing a capability" and tried to guess his intentions, said Anthony 
H. Cordesman, a Georgetown University military analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is that regardless of whom you talk to in the intelligence 
community, guess is the operative word," he said. "When you have to guess, and 
when you have a demonstrated record of aggression, then you have no one but 
yourself to blame if you fail to react." 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said the new U.S. troop deployments will be facilitated by 
contingency plans that the Pentagon developed after the Gulf War that called 
for "pre-positioning" huge amounts of weapons and equipment in the area, some 
on cargo ships. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines from Camp Pendleton and the soldiers from Ft. Stewart will be 
flown to the Gulf area with only light combat gear and then "married up" -- in 
Pentagon jargon -- with tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles and other equipment 
now en route to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon has already sent several such "pre-positioned" cargo ships to the 
Gulf area, two of them from permanent berths at the Indian Ocean island of 
Diego Garcia and the rest continuously on station at sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Military commanders also sent two additional batteries of advanced Patriot 
air-defense missiles -- with about 170 soldiers in total -- to Kuwait on 
Friday. An earlier version of the Patriot was used to help knock down Iraqi 
Scud missiles in 1991, with mixed results.

HAITIAN MILITARY RULERS EXPECTED TO RESIGN TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH FREED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Increased U.S. pressure paid off Sunday as diplomatic sources said that 
Haitian army commander Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras and the army chief of staff, Brig. 
Gen. Philippe Biamby, will resign today, clearing the way for exiled President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide to return without major distraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras and Biamby are required by an agreement signed last month to give up 
their posts no later than Saturday, the expected date of Aristide's arrival. 
But U.S. officials pressed the two relentlessly to give up power immediately 
and to accept exile even though the agreement does not require either man to 
leave Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 To make sure the message was clear, Cedras was told during a Sunday afternoon 
meeting with Lt. Gen. Hugh Shelton, the commander of U.S. troops here, that he 
and Biamby should retire before the Saturday deadline and get out of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monday would be good, but no later than Wednesday," is the way one U.S. 
military source described the gist of Shelton's remarks to Cedras. 
</P>
<P>
 The military leader then relented, a diplomat said. "The decision was made 
after the meeting with Shelton. It's a good thing," the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Cedras and Biamby, U.S. officials said they want nearly all of 
the Haitian military high command to leave office, the only exception being 
Brig. Gen. Jean-Claude Duperval, who will be given temporary command of the 
army. 
</P>
<P>
 The new high command, which will also serve on an interim basis, will be 
composed of lower-ranking colonels and lieutenant colonels thought to have 
little personal allegiance to the departing officers and who were not directly 
involved in the Sept. 30, 1991, coup that drove Aristide from office. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day Sunday, there was confusion over when Cedras and Biamby 
actually were expected to leave office. 
</P>
<P>
 Various sources claiming to be close to Cedras gave varying information about 
the exact timing of the two generals' resignations. 
</P>
<P>
 Some sources said the two men will step down this morning; others said with 
equal confidence that the two will submit resignations Tuesday to be effective 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Another simply said Sunday that "it will take place within the next 48 hours." 
</P>
<P>
 And Defense Secretary William J. Perry told a television interviewer Sunday, 
"I believe he (Cedras) will leave and soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta, on NBC-TV's 
"Meet the Press," said he could not confirm reports that Cedras will resign 
today. "I can't confirm that at this point, but, clearly, we have this mission 
on track right now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a stable situation. There's calm that's been restored to the country. 
President Aristide is prepared to return. We have the Parliament in place. I 
think in a matter of days we will see democracy restored to Haiti, and that was 
the fundamental goal of the President's policy with regards to that area," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also expected to give up office is Emile Jonassaint, the military's puppet 
civilian president, who has also resisted leaving the Presidential Palace. "He 
will go either voluntarily or by being physically prevented from going to his 
office," one source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday had been the choice of most experts for the end of the brutal and 
corrupt military rule because that is the day Cedras' appointment as army 
commander expires. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is still holding out for Wednesday," a Cedras associate had said just 
before Shelton arrived at Cedras' hillside home overlooking Port-au-Prince. "He 
wants to claim he served his term, didn't leave under (U.S.) pressure. He also 
wants a dignified ceremony." 
</P>
<P>
 Two motives impelled U.S. officials to widen the interval between the 
Cedras-Biamby departures and Aristide's return, expected Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the last rallying point of anti-Aristide forces out of here," one 
U.S. official said. "We want them to see that they have no hope, that they lost 
and that their leaders have given up and left." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also want time to prepare for Aristide and the large contingent of 
foreign officials, diplomats and other public figures expected here for his 
return. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot to do," one U.S. official said, "and we need time to prepare 
for (Aristide's) arrival." 
</P>
<P>
 One U.S. source said Sunday that the Administration is considering having 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher and other officials accompany Aristide 
when he returns to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the attention has been on Cedras, the Americans also worked 
hard to the last minute to get an early resignation from Biamby, who is 
considered to have more loyalty among the 7,000 Haitian soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men, along with Port-au-Prince Police Chief Michel-Joseph Francois, were 
required to step down by the agreement hammered out by a mission led by former 
President Jimmy Carter last month. Francois quit last week and drove into exile 
in the neighboring Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 One source said that while Biamby will formally resign with Cedras, the chief 
of staff turned in his letter of resignation Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know he packed his things and closed his office" Saturday, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after Shelton left Cedras on Sunday afternoon, it was uncertain if either 
Cedras or Biamby will leave Haiti, although a source who knows them both said 
they will leave before Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The talk now is of Chile," the source said, "at least at the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 Family friends of Cedras say that he will ultimately end up in Spain, where he 
owns two homes, but that Biamby, who is not known for his worldliness, could go 
to Chile as the guest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the onetime dictator who still 
heads his nation's military. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Cedras finally showed signs of accepting reality. 
</P>
<P>
 He donned full ceremonial uniform in the morning and drove to Jonassaint's 
house for a formal visit. 
</P>
<P>
 His convoy of large four-wheel-drive vehicles and an accompanying pickup truck 
loaded with armed Haitian soldiers then drove to the Haitian Military Academy, 
where he graduated first in his class in 1973 and later taught. 
</P>
<P>
 From there Cedras went to military headquarters in downtown Port-au-Prince for 
a conference with other officers of the military high command. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of making a triumphant or even a nostalgic final tour, Cedras was 
forced to confront criticism from other officers for failing to defend their 
interests and for making last-minute assignments and transfers that allegedly 
favored his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources said that several colonels, including Diderot Sylvain, commander 
of the prestigious National Palace Guard, presented their resignations. 
</P>
<P>
 That Cedras had lost not only power but also respect from his men was evident 
from one of the soldiers guarding his house during the Shelton meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "You all know the general doesn't like you being here," Pvt. Jonas Ferel told 
reporters gathered by Cedras' gated house. "But I don't care if you stay or go. 
. . . I'm cool, whatever happens."

NEWS ANALYSIS; GOP NOT READY TO PAINT 'QUAYLE FOR PRESIDENT' SIGNS; POLITICS: 
FORMER VICE PRESIDENT IS HINTING AT HIS WHITE HOUSE PLANS. BUT PARTY CHIEFS SAY 
'96 IS TOO EARLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Wherever I go, people want me to think about 1996, so I will," Dan Quayle 
tells about 200 Republican loyalists gathered here for a fund-raising luncheon. 
Pausing to let the suspense build, he adds: "Let me be very clear. Bill Clinton 
will be a one-term President." As if on cue, his audience bursts into cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle's teasing reference to his plans for the 1996 campaign is more than 
just a setup for an applause line. As he himself acknowledges, the former vice 
president is giving "very serious consideration" to making a run for the White 
House. Between now and November's congressional elections, he will visit about 
30 states in what he calls "a conversation with the American people." 
</P>
<P>
 And most who hear him on the stump come away convinced that Quayle has some 
things going for him -- notably his early advocacy of "family values," an issue 
that has been taking on increasing resonance in both parties. The former vice 
president is also an early favorite of conservative Christians, a major 
activist bloc in the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for all his potential strengths, many Republican leaders and party 
operatives, including some of Quayle's own erstwhile aides, say they think that 
he would be better off putting his presidential ambitions on hold for 1996. 
They believe that, even under the most favorable circumstances, he needs more 
time to rid himself of baggage, particularly the impression of immaturity, that 
dogged his vice presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 "The press has tagged him with an image as a lightweight," said Michael 
Harrington, a former Lynchburg GOP official who heard Quayle speak here on 
behalf of Republican Oliver L. North, who is seeking to unseat Sen. Charles S. 
Robb (D-Va.). "And I don't think he has yet overcome that perception." 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle's admirers point out that he has confounded his detractors in the past. 
His controversial "Murphy Brown" speech brought forth a chorus of catcalls in 
1992. Yet the idea of "social sanctions" against women who bear children out of 
wedlock now has become conventional wisdom, embraced by voices as diverse as 
Atlantic Monthly magazine and Donna Shalala, secretary of health and human 
services in the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Even President Clinton, who once complained that he was "fed up" with 
politicians "lecturing" about family values, recently emphasized that theme 
himself, as Quayle has pointedly noted. "Welcome aboard, Mr. President," he 
jibed at last month's political strategy conference of the Christian Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 On that occasion and in other recent appearances, Quayle has been spelling out 
a family values agenda that combines an assortment of carrots and sticks. To 
encourage marriage, he would eliminate the so-called marriage tax penalty. He 
would also reward couples who have children by boosting the tax deduction for 
their offspring and indexing that deduction to the rate of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the ledger, he would eliminate all additional stipends to 
welfare mothers for children born out of wedlock, though he would leave the 
mothers themselves on the welfare rolls. "I know it sounds harsh," he told a 
reporter after his talk here. "But I tell you what's harsher: children who live 
in poverty generation after generation." 
</P>
<P>
 Should Quayle seek the GOP nomination, he would have the "inside track" on 
gaining the backing of conservative Christians, according to Ralph Reed, 
director of the Christian Coalition, the most potent of the groups on the 
religious right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our people appreciate his willingness to stand tall for them when these ideas 
were not popular," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
 But another influential Christian conservative, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, said 
he does not believe that Quayle nor any other candidate for the GOP nomination 
is in a position to monopolize support among Christian conservatives as Ronald 
Reagan did in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see a Ronald Reagan out there now," said Falwell, who sat at the head 
table at the Lynchburg fund-raising lunch for North. He said half a dozen other 
Republican presidential possibilities also could appeal to religious 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite the "Murphy Brown" episode, some conservative Christians question 
the strength of Quayle's commitment to their cause. "I think that he wants to 
be all things to all people," said Martin Mawyer, head of the Christian Action 
Network, a lobbying group that claims 80,000 supporters around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Mawyer points to Quayle's complaint in his best-selling book, "Standing Firm," 
that "strident behavior" at the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston 
hurt the GOP ticket. Mawyer said Quayle was trying to "distance himself" from 
religious conservatives with his book, while trying to "endear himself" to them 
in his travels around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the merits of this criticism, the stress on family values is only one 
aspect of the 47-year-old Quayle's political profile, shaped by a career that 
already has been shaken by more turbulence than most politicians endure in a 
lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle got off to a strong start. Though raised in privilege as the scion of a 
newspaper publishing dynasty, he demonstrated an affinity for the 
rough-and-tumble of politics, knocking off an eight-term Democratic incumbent 
in Indiana to gain a seat in the House in 1976. After only two terms there he 
unseated another long-entrenched Democrat, Birch Bayh, to enter the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 A big Senate reelection victory in 1986, combined with Quayle's boyish good 
looks and his rock-hard conservatism, boosted him onto the Republican ticket in 
1988 as George Bush's running mate. But his abrupt arrival on the national 
scene was spoiled by allegations that years before he had used family influence 
to join the National Guard, thus lessening his chances of service in the 
Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle spent the next four years trying to recover from the damage inflicted 
by that early furor, loyally carrying out his vice presidential duties at home 
and abroad. He never fully succeeded in washing the slate clean -- partly 
because of sometimes-unfair criticism, partly because of his own gaffes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless Quayle emerged from this four-year crucible seasoned and hardened 
by his difficulties and with a number of political assets. These included a 
network of allies among Republicans leaders he had met during his vice 
presidential travels and a base of support among conservative activists, drawn 
to him by shared beliefs and shared enemies, particularly among the so-called 
liberal media. 
</P>
<P>
 In personal terms, Quayle is also well positioned to seek the presidency. A 
substantial advance from his book, which has sold more than 500,000 copies 
since it was published in May, provides a financial cushion. He gets additional 
income from frequent speeches to business groups and colleges and from a small 
investment firm, Circle Investors, of which he is chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also involved, along with his former national security adviser, Karl 
Jackson, with two consulting firms, Global Alliances and FX Strategic Advisers, 
which provide advice on economic conditions abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 His role as a member of the board of trustees of the Hudson Institute, a 
conservative think tank, and chairman of its competitiveness center gives him 
continued access to the world of international and domestic policy development. 
An Indianapolis-based political action committee, Issues '94, directed by a 
former vice presidential staffer, Anne Hathaway, finances his political 
travels. 
</P>
<P>
 His continued campaigning for fellow Republicans is giving Quayle exposure in 
places that will be important battlegrounds in the 1996 contest for the 
Republican nomination and is helping him gather IOUs from GOP politicians who 
would be allies in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 In his appearances, overtly political and otherwise, Quayle sometimes tries to 
deal with the difficulties of his vice presidency with self-deprecating humor, 
some of it heavy-handed. Addressing a Hudson Institute luncheon honoring Bush's 
former national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, Quayle claimed that he asked 
Scowcroft: "How do you want to handle this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Whereupon Scowcroft supposedly suggested following the pattern they had used 
when both served in the White House. "You give the speech and I'll clean up 
afterward." 
</P>
<P>
 One peril for Quayle as he tests the political waters is that his itinerary 
often includes encounters with his longtime adversaries, the media. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really want me to come back in the arena," Quayle said recently. "They 
are ready for me. I am ready for them, if I choose to run. And I can't wait." 
</P>
<P>
 Bravado aside, Quayle at times does seem at ease with the press and at other 
times goes well out of his way to avoid controversy. The day before he stumped 
for North in Lynchburg, Quayle was asked at a Washington press conference 
whether he considered the former national security aide to be "a hero" in the 
Iran-Contra affair. Quayle seemed thrown on the defensive and his answer evoked 
memories of the celebrated description of him as "a deer caught in the 
headlights." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't in the White House at that time," he replied. "As a matter of fact, 
I never met Oliver North. I will meet him for the first time tomorrow. I know 
him by reputation. Our paths have never crossed. So I can't answer that 
question because I really don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Quayle expressed confidence that North would do well in the 
Senate if Virginia voters decide to send him there, and his previous emphatic 
disclaimer was overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 But if he should formally declare for the presidency, nearly everything he 
says will come under intense scrutiny, and any similar comments suggesting a 
lack of assurance or poise would only serve to reinforce existing doubts about 
his electability -- doubts that exist even among his admirers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would think he might be better off for his long-term future to not run this 
time and to spend his efforts helping the party as he is doing now," said 
Ernest Angelo, a longtime Republican national committeeman from Texas. Though 
Angelo rates Quayle highly and thinks he got a "bum rap" as vice president, 
"with the general public I think he still has some problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.) said he suggested to Quayle that he get elected 
governor of Indiana as a way of re-establishing his political identity before 
plunging into the presidential sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Skepticism about Quayle's presidential prospects is shared by former Quayle 
staff members, including his former chief of staff, William Kristol, who said 
he believes that Quayle would have trouble raising the money to run a 
successful campaign for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll get a lot of people who are willing to give him $1,000 because they 
like him," said Kristol, who now heads the Project for the Republican Future, 
an advocacy and strategy group. "What they won't do is go out and raise $10,000 
from their friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Al Hubbard, former deputy chief of Quayle's vice presidential staff and now 
party chairman for his home state of Indiana, conceded that many "party 
insiders and major donors" are "handicapping the race" and have concluded that 
Quayle would face "too big a hill for him to climb." 
</P>
<P>
 But he pointed out: "These are the people who said Richard Nixon was washed up 
and said Bill Clinton would never get off the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 If Quayle decides to run, Hubbard insisted, he would win over these skeptics 
in time and oblige the press to take him seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Quayle has that no one can question is a steadfastness, a sincerity 
which he demonstrated for four years. He has proven that he is someone who will 
absolutely stand up for what he believes in, and that's what the American 
people want."

COLUMN ONE; THE CIA'S DIRTY LITTLE SECRET; A FEMALE AGENT'S LAWSUIT HAS OPENED 
A WINDOW TO THE FRAT-HOUSE CULTURE AMONG MALE SPIES. BLATANT SEXISM, ALCOHOL 
ABUSE APPEAR TO HAVE LONG BEEN TOLERATED, BUT OFFICIALS VOW CHANGE.

<P>
 According to accounts reaching Washington in the late 1980s, the Central 
Intelligence Agency station in Jamaica was a menagerie of misfits, incompetents 
and twisted personalities -- an overstaffed way station for time-servers no one 
else wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputy station chief reportedly assaulted his wife repeatedly, once 
throttling her until she passed out. Another agent was cited for getting drunk 
in a hotel bar and screaming out her rage against the CIA. A third allegedly 
threatened to kill his own security guards. 
</P>
<P>
 These sordid details leap out of a sex-discrimination lawsuit filed in August 
by the CIA agent -- the first female chief of station in Latin America -- 
assigned to clean up the Jamaica operation. The agency, declining to comment 
while her suit is pending, has neither confirmed nor challenged her account. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer, known in court documents as Jane Doe Thompson but identified by 
numerous sources as Janine M. Brookner, arrived in the Jamaican capital of 
Kingston in 1989 with a sterling reputation for prowess as a spy and for 
personal probity. 
</P>
<P>
 She immediately began to try to assert control over the mess she inherited. 
She tried counseling her wayward charges, wrote warnings into their performance 
appraisals and finally reported them to CIA headquarters in Langley, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened next shocked most who had known Brookner, 53, during her 
stainless 21-year career at the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
 In what her backers described as a bureaucratic covert operation, the spies of 
the Jamaica station turned the tables on their boss, demanding that she be 
investigated by the CIA's inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
 They portrayed her as a drunk and a sexpot. They accused her of cheating on 
her overtime slips and of misusing a CIA helicopter assigned to Jamaica for 
anti-drug operations. Today she is a discredited spy doing make-work in a 
windowless cubicle at CIA headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 While the courts will ultimately decide the merits of the Brookner case, the 
episode has raised a larger question of whether the CIA, as she charges, is 
marked by a "pervasive atmosphere of machismo and sexual discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 Interviews with current and former CIA officials suggest there is 
substantiation for Brookner's claim that the Directorate of Operations, the 
true heart of the CIA, is a male-run enclave whose very secrecy has insulated 
it from the larger society it is meant to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics charge that the agency indulges and promotes hard-drinking, 
skirt-chasing male agents. They cite the case of convicted traitor Aldrich H. 
Ames, who was promoted into sensitive positions despite being -- by his own 
description -- a "falling-down drunk." 
</P>
<P>
 The officials say Brookner's case is surprising only because she rose so high 
and fell so hard, and that scores of other women have been methodically 
thwarted in their efforts to rise through agency ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers representing female clandestine service officers are threatening a 
class-action lawsuit accusing the agency of systematic discrimination. Rod 
Boggs of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights said there is an egregious 
pattern of gender bias at the CIA. "I've been doing these kinds of cases -- 
both in government and private industry -- for more than 20 years, and I've 
never seen such clear-cut evidence of discrimination," Boggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the case has narrowed from several hundred potential plaintiffs to about 
50 or 60 female officers, not all of whom are willing to go public with their 
complaints for fear of retaliation. Observers inside and outside the agency say 
they expect the action to be settled before it reaches court. 
</P>
<P>
 CIA officials deny that sexual harassment and discrimination are rampant at 
the agency and are part of its culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the CIA's own classified "glass-ceiling study" conducted in 1991 found 
almost 50% of female officers said they had been sexually harassed. Most said 
they had not reported the incidents to male superiors because they believed to 
do so would be career suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 The study described the CIA as an "adverse work environment" for women and 
said reprisals against women "seem to go unchecked." 
</P>
<P>
 In her suit, Brookner said she had been subjected to unwanted sexual advances 
from male bosses in virtually every assignment she held in the United States 
and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brookner and Ames cases also opened a window on another bit of agency 
dirty laundry -- endemic alcohol abuse, particularly at the CIA's foreign 
stations. Current and former officials -- some very senior -- say heavy 
drinking has been tolerated, even when it threatens security and operations, in 
a frat-house culture that appears to condone virtually any offense except 
snitching on colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when a pattern of alcohol abuse is widely known, as it was in Ames' case, 
the agency appears loath to move against one of its own. It worries about the 
effect on morale and fears that disciplinary action could push a spiteful 
officer over to the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 What emerges from court documents and interviews with numerous CIA officials 
is a portrait of ordinary people with ordinary vices operating under 
extraordinary secrecy and duress. Often living under cover and forced to 
conceal their identities even from their own children, CIA officers tend to 
socialize among themselves in a protective cocoon. They drink as part of their 
work of recruiting foreign spies and to relieve the stress, isolation and 
tedium of their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The court papers and interviews also depict a climate of frequent debauchery 
and unchecked libido, protected by a cult and culture of secrecy and the 
largely unaccountable power of foreign station chiefs and senior barons at CIA 
headquarters. Women are viewed by many as a hindrance or, at best, an 
operational tool to lure potential agents into spying for the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more fraternal than machismo in the Directorate of Operations," a former 
senior CIA official said. "It's a circle-the-wagons culture spurred on by 
elitism. They are very supportive of one another because they see themselves as 
the centurions, the guardians, and their task is difficult and not readily 
understood by anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Added another former top agency official: "It's an organization with a sense 
of mission, like the carrier pilot fraternity. The idea that a woman could do 
this diminishes the thing. It's all about the male ego." 
</P>
<P>
 Director of Central Intelligence R. James Woolsey asserted in an interview 
that he was determined to change this culture, although he admitted it was at 
least a five- to 10-year task. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am committed to making any changes I need to in order to ensure that the 
D.O. (Directorate of Operations, as the clandestine service is known) is not a 
white male fraternity. Not only is it unjust to be a white male fraternity, it 
is ineffective," Woolsey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is excellent for the D.O. to have a spirit of camaraderie, the way a good 
military unit does, where people take care of one another. (But) it is also 
important that in doing so, they deal with one another's shortcomings in a fair 
and disciplined way, as was not done in the Ames case." 
</P>
<P>
 The sexism and the tolerance for heavy drinking and incompetence that Woolsey 
vowed to change have led to incidents such as these: 
</P>
<P>
 * At least two of the current top operations directorate chiefs have had 
sexual affairs with subordinates, the Brookner suit alleges. One of them was 
discovered in flagrante delicto with a female employee on the couch in his 
office at CIA headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 * Edward Lee Howard, who later became a spy for the KGB, went to the CIA's 
medical services office in 1981 for counseling because he believed he had a 
serious drinking problem. The counselor dismissed his concern. "I've got people 
who sit in the parking lot at headquarters, drinking," the adviser said, 
according to David Wise's book on the Howard case, "The Spy Who Got Away." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got one lady who filled her windshield wiper dispenser with vodka and 
rigged the line so the hose comes inside the car. When she's caught in traffic, 
she can turn on the wipers and squirt herself," the counselor said, telling 
Howard to "settle down" and come back if his drinking got worse. 
</P>
<P>
 * The CIA station chief in Taiwan some years ago became enamored of the wife 
of one of his junior officers. To facilitate his seduction of the woman, he 
repeatedly sent the husband on extended and dangerous out-of-town assignments. 
The marriage eventually dissolved and the station chief married the woman, 
according to a former CIA officer who served in the region at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 * In another sexual-harassment complaint against the agency, a CIA secretary 
said her career was ruined after she rebuffed the attentions of the station 
chief where she was posted. She applied for another foreign job but was told 
that she was "too attractive" to be sent to that post. Later she was informed 
that there was a "psychological/medical" hold on future assignments because of 
her earlier complaint, which revealed her to be too "headstrong" to merit 
promotion. The woman's attorney, Pamela B. Stuart, said it was "inconceivable 
that a man would be denied an overseas job because of his looks" and alleged 
that her client was a victim of "bureaucratic psycho-terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
 * In an episode alleged in the Brookner case, a female CIA case officer in 
Jamaica suffered repeated bouts of depression and binge drinking after her 
numerous failed affairs, including one with a married Drug Enforcement 
Administration official based on the island. The woman, referred to in court 
documents only as "Rachel," got roaring drunk at a public bar at the Wyndham 
Hotel in Kingston at a January, 1990, party for U.S. Embassy, CIA and Secret 
Service officials. Rachel reportedly revealed to all within earshot that she 
worked for the CIA and endangered the cover of several other undercover 
officers attending the party. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Brookner suit also tells of a drunk senior operations directorate 
executive falling over a coffee table while lunging for a female guest at a 
party in Caracas, Venezuela; of a former chief of clandestine operations who 
got so plastered during a meeting with foreign intelligence officials that he 
could not remember whether he had revealed sensitive internal information to 
them; of a top overseas agent nicknamed the "afternoon chief of station" 
because most mornings he was too hung over to show up for work. 
</P>
<P>
 Agency defenders say the days of heavy boozing and womanizing are past and 
point to the rising numbers of women in the clandestine service and throughout 
the agency. Overall, 42% of CIA employees are women; 38% of workers classified 
as professionals are women. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey noted that six of the 13 senior CIA officials who report directly to 
him are women, including the general counsel, the comptroller, the head of the 
equal opportunity office, the head of congressional affairs and the director of 
the National Intelligence Council. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of the four substantive baronies of the CIA -- the directorates of 
operations, intelligence analysis, administration and science and technology -- 
has ever been run by a woman. And only the administration directorate has a 
woman as its No. 2 official. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been a marked increase in the assignment of female spies overseas in 
recent years, according to CIA statistics. As of last month, 30% of clandestine 
officers overseas and 20% of station chiefs were women. The first female chief 
of station was not named until 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 But women still are a rarity at the executive level. Only 12% of the top 
officers -- the Senior Intelligence Service -- are women, and no woman has ever 
reached the No. 2 spot in the operations directorate. 
</P>
<P>
 Brookner might have been on her way to breaking that glass ceiling had the 
questionable charges that sank her career not arisen. She was slated to be 
chief of station in Prague, beginning this summer, which might have led to a 
bigger European station and eventually to a top job at Langley. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she was brought down by allegations that might be laughable had the 
CIA not taken them so seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Brookner was accused of drunkenness by subordinate officers she had 
disciplined for intemperate public drinking. She was described as a "sexual 
provocateur " by two officers who said that while she never actually touched 
them, she gave the impression that she "might make a pass." She was cited for 
wearing "brief shorts and thin T-shirts with . . . no perceptible or very 
skimpy underwear" -- in her own home in a tropical climate. She was accused of 
lying on her overtime sheets -- to the tune of $150.96 over several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous witnesses -- including many of Brookner's former CIA bosses, several 
ambassadors with whom she worked (including former U.N. Ambassador Jeane J. 
Kirkpatrick), her ex-husband and her son -- have said the charges against 
Brookner were ludicrous and utterly inconsistent with her reputation for 
sobriety, rectitude and personal modesty. Some said the charge that she wore 
provocative clothing was especially surprising because she has a long scar from 
open-heart surgery and self-consciously dresses to conceal it. 
</P>
<P>
 Either those witnesses were not interviewed by the CIA's inspector general or 
their testimony was ignored in his final, devastating report. An agency 
official said it was standing policy to include relevant favorable comments in 
such reports and noted, "I know of no exceptions." 
</P>
<P>
 How, then, to account for Brookner's fate? A senior CIA official said the suit 
exaggerated her abilities and suggested that, even without the allegations, she 
was not destined for a high-level post. He hinted that there were other 
factors, classified and confidential, in her record that would disqualify her. 
</P>
<P>
 Absurd, replied Brookner's lawyer, Victoria Toensing, formerly chief counsel 
for the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Justice Department's top 
counterterrorism official. Brookner's downfall can be attributed to a 
conspiracy by vicious subordinates she had disciplined and to a culture 
receptive to charges against women, said Toensing, now a Washington attorney 
with the Los Angeles-based firm of Manatt, Phelps & Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is how they treat a turncoat," said Toensing, who generally has 
supported the agency in the past. "They were trying to teach her a lesson." 
</P>
<P>
 She said Brookner's accusers were schooled in the arts of intrigue, treachery 
and deception, and used them all to destroy her. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are people who believe that women can be tools or weapons, but they 
cannot be colleagues," Toensing said. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this is mildly amusing to Eloise Randolph Page, the CIA's pioneer 
female operative, now retired after more than 40 years in the spy trade -- 
dating back to the wartime Office of Strategic Services. She said proudly that 
she was the "first woman everything" -- branch chief, division chief, station 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Page said, most of the current women at the agency who complain that they 
have been denied promotions probably did not deserve them. She contended that 
the agency has gone "too far too fast" in trying to integrate women into the 
covert operations branch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly," Page said, "there weren't that many women capable of being case 
officers or running operations. They sent women where they shouldn't have been, 
so they didn't perform all that well." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, by her own description, Page's career path was potholed by sex 
discrimination at every turn. She asserted that sexism in the operations 
directorate was "endemic and part of the culture." 
</P>
<P>
 When Page was first considered for the position of chief of station, in Oslo 
in the early 1970s, then-Deputy Director for Operations Archie Roosevelt vetoed 
the promotion, saying he would never have a female station chief. 
</P>
<P>
 She was later offered two window-dressing posts -- station chief in Canberra 
and in London. She turned them down because the United States did not run 
operations against Australia or Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not going to be exploited," Page said. "I was not going to be a token." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, Chief of Operations John McMahon decided to appoint her chief of 
station in Athens, a key post earlier held by Richard Welch, who was 
assassinated by leftists in 1975, and Clair E. George, who later became 
operations director until he retired in the backwash of the Iran-Contra 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 30 years after the founding of the CIA, the agency was to have its 
first female chief of station. 
</P>
<P>
 "When McMahon announced it, at the end of a list of 15 senior appointments, 
you could have heard a Kleenex drop in that room. It was unbelievable," Page 
recalled. "Half of the men walked over to congratulate me. And half of the men 
walked out of the room without saying a word."

THE ANGRY UNDECIDED -- 15 SWING VOTERS GIVE VIEWS; ELECTION: PEOPLE LIKE THESE 
WILL BE VITAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE. DISILLUSIONMENT FIGURES LARGE IN THEIR 
UNCERTAINTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Marvin Hershman watches Southern California deteriorate around him and wonders 
why the government does so little about it. 
</P>
<P>
 A contracts manager for Litton Industries, Hershman, 60, is angry. The 
politicians, he says, are more concerned with their own reelection than with 
helping people like him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally do not believe they give a damn," Hershman says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the West Hills Democrat and father of three sometimes feels as if his 
is a voice in the wilderness, he is not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Opinion polls show that most California voters believe their state is going in 
the wrong direction. 
</P>
<P>
 To find out in a more direct and personal way what voters are thinking about, 
The Times invited Hershman and 14 other San Fernando Valley residents to 
discuss their concerns as the election approaches. The group met for two hours 
over dinner with a Times editor and reporters in Chatsworth, and they agreed to 
meet again as the election draws closer. 
</P>
<P>
 All have voted at least twice in the past three elections and said they 
intended to go to the polls Nov. 8, when Gov. Pete Wilson, seeking a second 
term, will be opposed by state Treasurer Kathleen Brown. These voters were 
chosen in part because they are undecided about the governor's race. Swing 
voters like these could make the difference in a close election, and the 
campaigns will try hard to win them over. 
</P>
<P>
 Although by no means a scientific survey, the group included a cross-section 
of Republicans and Democrats, men and women. Married and single, some with 
children, they ranged in age from 27 to 71. 
</P>
<P>
 The voters interviewed by The Times have clear reason to be weary. The west 
San Fernando Valley, once a center of heavy manufacturing and defense industry 
activity, has seen the closure of plant after plant, and a ripple effect on 
small business and individuals. Many people are still putting their lives back 
together after suffering damage in the earthquake that shook Northridge on Jan. 
17. 
</P>
<P>
 They are people like Joseph Jurik, an aerospace engineer who is happy to have 
a job even though he has had to commute an hour each way to work since Hughes 
Aircraft closed its Canoga Park plant a few minutes from his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Or Mary Kranz, a librarian whose Bell Canyon house has plummeted in value just 
as she was preparing to cash in her equity to help put three children through 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 Or Rhoda Glassman of Northridge, whose daughter teaches elementary school and 
says that her pupils increasingly arrive at the classroom with so many problems 
that they are unprepared to learn even basic skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "California is not sunny-side up anymore," said Corrine Squire-Strompf, a 
medical transcriptionist from Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 These voters fear that their children and grandchildren will find it 
difficult, if not impossible, to duplicate the standard of living they have 
enjoyed. They say they don't hear any answers from the candidates who are 
running, and they blame the media, in part, for focusing on the trivial while 
major issues and the candidates' records go ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Takuro Nakae, a retired mechanical engineer, believes the economy is 
suffocating beneath too many taxes and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to protect the turtles, the spotted owls and everything else," said 
Nakae, 71, of Winnetka. "People and business are at the bottom of the list." 
</P>
<P>
 And Steven Grimshaw, a registered nurse from West Hills, said he recently 
spoke to a laid-off Hughes engineer selling appliances at the Canoga Park 
Sears, just before the department store also closed down. While Grimshaw 
believes his own future is secure in the health care industry, he said the 
economic downturn has sapped the spirit of his neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, we may have had financial hardships," said Grimshaw, a 44-year-old 
Republican. "But there was always that hope. There were always jobs out there. 
Today, people don't know where their next job is going to come from. And many 
people are afraid the job they have today isn't going to be around tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked for a show of hands, 14 of the 15 voters hosted by The Times said they 
thought things were getting worse in California, not better. The lone 
dissenter: Chatsworth High School teacher Marcia Meyerstein, who said last year 
was so bad for her that this year, while not great, looks good in comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of anxiety breeds anger, and the conversation last week reflected 
anger toward politicians, as well as increasingly toward illegal immigrants. 
Several of the participants in the Times' forum argued forcefully that they are 
being unfairly forced to shoulder a burden for providing services to people who 
should not be in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have now a disproportionate amount of our tax money being spent 
subsidizing these people who do not speak English," said Hershman, the Litton 
contracts manager. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not just the tax burden that irks people like Hershman. He and others 
complained that the new immigrants do not seem to want to assimilate into 
America, to become part of the "melting pot" they believe made the country 
great. 
</P>
<P>
 At work, Hershman said, they commemorate Mexican holidays. "Cinco de Mayo we 
celebrated," he scoffs. "Do they celebrate the Fourth of July in Mexico?" 
</P>
<P>
 Polls show that such sentiments cross party lines, and the discussion bore 
that out. Hershman is a Democrat. So is Rhoda Glassman, who, pronouncing 
herself "politically incorrect," complains about "hyphenated Americans" and the 
fact that her ballot comes with foreign language translations. 
</P>
<P>
 But such views were not unanimous. Felipe Hervais, a Democrat from Reseda, 
said the immigrants he knows came to this country to build a better life for 
their children. They may not speak English, the 27-year-old computer programmer 
said, but they want their children to learn the language of their adopted home. 
</P>
<P>
 And Grimshaw, the Republican from West Hills, said politicians are using the 
immigration issue to distract voters from more important matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a smoke screen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Grimshaw and the others mentioned crime as a worry, it did not dominate 
their conversation the way one might expect of an issue that polls say is the 
major concern of voters. Instead, they talked about schools and the economy, 
and about government itself -- and those who lead it. They are sick of the 
finger-pointing, the backbiting and the selfishness, they said, and they are 
tired of negative campaigning. They want action. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're being stopped and stymied by the politicians and those morons running 
around in Sacramento and Washington," said Alvin Green, a Northridge lawyer. 
"They will say and do anything to keep their jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Jurik, the West Hills aerospace engineer, said he sees no "spirit of 
community" in government today. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just the opposite," he said. "Our state and local communities are at 
odds with each other and do their best to make sure their little turf is taken 
care of first." 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians of all stripes, the Times' panel of voters said, only seem able to 
move when their own interests are on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say it takes a long time for legislation to pass," Hershman said. "Have 
you ever noticed that when they are interested in giving themselves a raise or 
their retirement, man, it happens in one goddamn minute." 
</P>
<P>
 The discontent observed by The Times is similar to what political consultants 
for Gov. Wilson, Kathleen Brown and other candidates say they are hearing from 
voter focus groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are alienated by politics and politicians," said Steve Glazer, a 
senior adviser to Brown. "They are unhappy with the direction of the state." 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent Los Angeles Times poll found that 8% of the electorate was 
still undecided, though a like number also said they were only "leaning" toward 
one candidate or the other. The governor's political aides believe that many of 
the voters who remain undecided into October simply will not vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're disaffected people, really," George Gorton, Wilson's campaign 
manager, said of those still undecided in this race. "They don't think the 
political system is doing for them what they want to have done." 
</P>
<P>
 But oddly, the voters meeting with The Times, while angry at government, still 
lean toward keeping in office those politicians who already are there. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to choose between Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and her 
Republican challenger, Rep. Mike Huffington of Santa Barbara, the voters sided 
with Feinstein by a whopping 13-1 margin. They cited Huffington's wealth and 
his willingness to spend it, his lack of a record, and even rumors about his 
wife's religious beliefs as reasons for opposing him. 
</P>
<P>
 The tally in the governor's race, while also lopsided in favor of the 
incumbent, was less firm. Ten said they would tend to side with Wilson, while 
four chose Brown and one said she still could not decide. Almost all made it 
clear, though, that they were still open to choosing the other candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would people who are so disenchanted with the system -- and with 
incumbents in general -- stick with the governor rather than throw him out? 
</P>
<P>
 Most said they give Wilson credit for trying. They realize he can't turn the 
state around by himself. The Democrats in the Legislature, they say, have 
blocked him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They cannot do this overnight," said Squire-Strompf, who said she watched the 
state of Kansas endure a similar transition when the civil aviation industry 
went bust. "We're going to have to be patient." 
</P>
<P>
 Others said they might be willing to oust Wilson but felt uncomfortable with 
Brown, about whom they know very little other than that her father and brother 
were governors before her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's like a blank canvas," one said. "She's trading on a name." 
</P>
<P>
 Green, the lawyer, said he wants to know more before he decides which 
candidate to select. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she's going to closely align to her brother Jerry Brown, she'll be the 
worst thing that could ever happen to this state," he said. "If she's going to 
align her to her father and try to do what he did when he was governor, then 
she'll be something very good for this state and all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 But Green said he has no idea which scenario is more likely. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like taking a dart and throwing it against the wall," he said. Some 
Viewpoints From the Valley 
</P>
<P>
 To learn what voters are thinking, The Times, assisted by Davis Research of 
Calabasas, selected 15 San Fernando Valley residents who have voted in at least 
two of the past three elections and are undecided about the race for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The group included a cross-section of voters, but was far too small to 
represent a scientific sampling of the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 10 Democrats, 4 Republicans and an Independent in the group. There 
were 8 men and 7 women. The group was mostly white, which while not reflective 
of California, is similar to the ethnic makeup of the electorate. Thirteen of 
the 15 were married. Twelve were working, while one was retired, one unemployed 
and one identified herself as a housewife. 
</P>
<P>
 The discussion took place over dinner provided by The Times at its Chatsworth 
office and was moderated by California Political Editor Mark Saylor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times intends to talk to the same voters two more times during the final 
month before the Nov. 8 election to find out whether the candidates are 
reaching these voters and what issues are of greatest concern.

THE NEW GETTY CENTER RISES ABOVE THE MASSES; ARCHITECTURE: IN THE SEPULVEDA 
PASS, A STRUCTURE OF TOWERING, POWERFUL PROFILE IS TO BE THE HOME OF THE 
WORLD'S MOST FORMIDABLE PRIVATE ARTS INSTITUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To the wonderment and, no doubt, perplexity of hundreds of thousands of 
commuters daily, it rises in Sepulveda Pass like a 14th Century mountaintop 
stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprawling along a ridge line high above the San Diego Freeway, the emerging 
structure of boxlike buildings and interlocking walls presents a portentous 
visage of money and power. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 800 workers at a time, like the craftsmen of a medieval city, stride its 
scaffolds laying Italian marble, scurry over its Olympian terraces planting 
trees by the thousand and scale its three-quarter-mile elevated causeway 
installing track for the tram that will some day connect this enclave on the 
hill to the world below. 
</P>
<P>
 Without so much as a five-foot sign to identify their purpose, they could as 
easily be erecting a hotel for the unconscionably rich or a retreat for an 
order of ascetic monks. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither commercial nor reclusive motives, however, are behind one of the 
largest construction projects under way in the western United States. The 
emerging wall of marble is to be a stronghold of the arts: the future home of 
the world's most formidable private arts institution, the J. Paul Getty Trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Already 10 years in the making -- and still three years from its scheduled 
1997 opening -- the $733-million Getty Center is now about half completed, a 
milestone that has prompted Getty officials to conduct an open house this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The informal tour will give the local news media a look inside the 110-acre 
college-like campus that will consolidate the Getty's Malibu museum with the 
trust's art history, education and conservation programs, now in rented 
quarters in Santa Monica and Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 The scale and reaching ambition of New York architect Richard Meier's project 
has touched off a flurry of debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Though a minority decry the center's provocative location and massive profile, 
no one denies that the Getty Center has already established itself as the Los 
Angeles cultural landmark to eclipse all others. 
</P>
<P>
 "If God had the money, this is perhaps what he would do," said the prickly Los 
Angeles design critic Sam Hall Kaplan, who was prepared to hate Meier's 
architectural statement, but found he couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "The statement . . . is that this is a cultural institution here for the ages, 
not a passing indulgence, not a deconstructionist exercise by yet another 
narcissistic architect, of which there are many." 
</P>
<P>
 Less sanguine observers have faulted the center as elitist, remote and 
confusing, comparing it to the Getty itself.

 "Looking up from the freeway below, motorists will see a series of mostly 
windowless marble cliffs, some as high as 120 feet above the slopes from which 
they spring," critic Leon Whiteson wrote in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that most of the criticism comes from the East, Kaplan said he detects 
a hidden envy that Los Angeles, and not New York, has the Getty, whose 
ambition, as New York Times architecture critic Paul Goldberger concedes, is 
"to spring full-blown from the brow of this hill in Brentwood as the world's 
largest, richest, most comprehensive and most ambitious institution in the 
visual arts." 
</P>
<P>
 Local commentators, indeed, could hardly restrain their expectation that the 
consolidated prestige of the Getty will elevate Los Angeles to the cultural 
status of New York and Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will become one of the must-visits for anyone who has traveled," Los 
Angeles City Planning Director Con Howe said. "Anyone will consider it as 
important as the Louvre or the National Gallery." 
</P>
<P>
 Howe, formerly a planner in New York City, said the Getty Center will be 
different from other great museums like the Metropolitan or the Pompidou 
because Los Angeles is a different kind of city from New York or Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaborating on that theme, architect David Martin said freeways have replaced 
rivers and grand boulevards as travel arteries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important for Los Angeles to have it along the freeway," Martin 
said. "It reminds all of the million or so people who drive it every day that 
there is a part of our culture that has to do with art and fineness and 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that's a bad idea to have in everybody's face every day," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The quintessential Los Angeles creation, the Getty Center may become the 
world's only important urban museum that will never be "discovered" by a 
tourist rambling the byways of a strange city. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors -- who may need reservations to get in -- and employees will arrive 
by a Euro-style tramway from the six-level underground garage beside Sepulveda 
Boulevard to a formal transit stop atop the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, the 700 Getty employees will angle north toward the working end of 
the institution containing administrative offices and the bulk of the Getty's 
other arts programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The hilltop complex will feature a cafe, a restaurant, a 450-seat auditorium, 
gardens, fountains and panoramic views of the mountains, the Pacific and the 
city skyline. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece, a museum complex of pavilions ringing a garden courtyard, 
will house all the existing Getty Museum's collections except its Greek and 
Roman antiquities, which will remain on the Malibu site. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new museum, visitors will be able to see such high-priced Getty 
treasures as Van Gogh's "Irises" bathed in natural light, as well as holdings 
the public has not seen before because of limited gallery space in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing like the new center exists in Los Angeles, or anywhere else. And it is 
unlikely that any contemporary institution but the Getty Trust, whose endowment 
is worth $4.1 billion, could afford such a project. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, the center and the trust evolved together. 
</P>
<P>
 Little known before J. Paul Getty's death in 1976, the trust gained visibility 
as it doubled, then tripled the oil magnate's $1-billion bequest. 
</P>
<P>
 Required by federal law to spend no less than 4.25% of its assets each year, 
the trust began to sprout programs. There are now eight. They include a grants 
program, a high-tech art history information program, a worldwide program to 
promote the conservation of endangered art works and a center for the history 
of art and the humanities that offers yearlong fellowships to a dozen scholars. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Getty Trust president Harold Williams said he wanted to give each 
new program its own identity, with its own directors and space. The decision to 
pull them all together on a campus presented the challenge "not only to help 
create the architecture, but also to create the institution itself," Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The give-and-take slowed the planning to a seven-year crawl. Along the way, 
costs climbed from the opening estimate of $360 million to the current figure 
of $733 million, bemusing some in an expectant art world. 
</P>
<P>
 "If most projects today suffer from too little time and too little money," 
observed critic Goldberger, the Getty's problem has been "too much time and too 
much money." 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, however, the project also has been molded by political 
compromise. The conditional-use permit obtained by the trust in 1985 imposes 
107 conditions meant to mollify the wealthy and politically connected neighbors 
of Brentwood and Bel Air. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum and related structures will occupy only a quarter of the 24 acres 
reserved for development at the top of the hill. A height limit of 65 feet 
above the plaza level for the museum complex and 45 feet for the other 
buildings forced Meier to abandon his vision of modeling the center's profile 
after an Italian mountaintop village with turrets and towers. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the neighborhood's objection that Meier's signature white enamel surfaces 
would create too much glare prevailed. In place of the smooth, bright building 
skins, 180,000 slabs of rough-hewn beige travertine marble were imported from 
the same quarries that supplied the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
 As another accession, the center's seven-level, 1,550-space parking structure, 
now complete, is buried underground at the west end of the one access road, 
Getty Center Drive off Sepulveda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors' concerns about traffic led to the electric tram system. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these accommodations may contribute to the complaint that the 
experience of the Getty will be too orchestrated, like a visit to Walt Disney 
World, where by design, random experiences are kept to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is, above all, the imposing location that arouses the emotion of 
critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling it an "elitist statement 25 million times worse" than an ethnic slur, 
one architect who asked not to be named said the hilltop location represents an 
obvious disdain for the city below, a sentiment more suited to the 19th Century 
than the 20th. 
</P>
<P>
 Countering that view, Adolfo Nodal, general manager of the Los Angeles 
Department of Cultural Affairs, praised the Getty for its street-level programs 
to restore a mural by Mexican artist David Siqueiros on Olvera Street and 
assist the Watts Towers Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is up on a hill, and it will be a Taj Mahal, but I think they're aware of 
that and make sure the community gets there, and that they get to the 
community." Nodal said. "I think they're really focused now on trying to take 
this incredible bounty that they've got to make sure that the people in the 
city are getting access to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Getty officials themselves are confident the interplay of natural and man-made 
beauty will connect their center with the city below. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing at freeway level fully prepares the first-timer for the panoramic 
views at the top. "We see it as a place where people will come to see Los 
Angeles," said Getty Museum Director John Walsh of the new complex and its 
sweeping vistas. 
</P>
<P>
 The views are memorable even when morning fog -- or worse -- limits how far 
the visitor can see. "It's a place that will have lots of moods," said Walsh, 
who, as an art historian, understands the power of atmospheric effects. "It's 
right where the sea air plays a teasing game with dryer air inland, so fogs 
sometimes come in that far and then back off again and swirl around above you." 
</P>
<P>
 Now little more than concrete bones, the museum will be the center's big draw. 
Visitors will enter a two-story circular lobby, which will include a book and 
gift shop and two orientation theaters. The glass-filled lobby will open to a 
61,000-square-foot garden courtyard. They can choose among the five gallery 
pavilions that make up the museum proper. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh said the new museum will allow people to see many of the Getty's 
holdings, long in storage, for the first time. There will be twice as much room 
for displaying photographs. The Getty's growing collection of drawings will 
have more gallery space, as will its little-known collection of European 
sculpture. Fourteen galleries will house the Getty's important collection of 
French furniture and decorative arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the paintings will be displayed in second-story galleries normally 
flooded with daylight. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are rooms that have exactly the kind of lively, beautiful natural light 
that most pictures were painted in and intended to be seen in." 
</P>
<P>
 The new museum will also include an area devoted to loan shows. These, he 
said, could include shows devoted to contemporary art and African, Asian and 
pre-Columbian works. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh and other Getty officials say they want the new center to be a place of 
renewal. The gardens will be a major part of the experience, they predict. 
Walsh said that, for many visitors, the Getty Center experience "will start 
like MOCA and end like the Huntington," with the grounds -- and the views -- 
playing an important role. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want it to be a place that families feel free to come to," Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh said 1.5 million visitors a year are expected, triple what the Malibu 
museum can accommodate. As a result, the center will probably require visitors 
to make advance parking reservations, at least at first, just as the Malibu 
museum does. The plan is to drop the reservation requirement as soon as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 As the opening begins to draw closer, one travertine slab and newly planted 
tree at a time, the one fear seems to be that the center will prove too 
popular. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the problem," Walsh said, "is going to be dealing with the number of 
people who want to come." 
</P>

O.C. MARINES AMONG THOSE TO ANSWER CALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stashed among the gear of one Marine boarding a troop transport plane headed 
toward the Persian Gulf from this Riverside County base Sunday was a memento of 
the last time U.S. forces faced Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein -- a faded American 
flag. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's worn and tattered but still in good shape," said Master Sgt. William 
Lee, a lean 20-year veteran who had the flag with him during the seven months 
he spent in Saudi Arabia during Desert Storm and Desert Shield. "I just can't 
wait to bring it home again." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, who is based at Camp Pendleton, and 299 other Marines whose job it will 
be to ready tanks, trucks and other equipment for arriving troops had been 
mustered to this desert air base beginning at 1:30 a.m. from Pendleton and the 
Twentynine Palms Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in San Bernardino 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 They and 65 Navy personnel were about to fly in three C-141 Starlifters to 
Diego Garcia, a naval base in the Indian Ocean where they will board ships 
headed for the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of about 700 Marines and sailors made up Southern California's 
contingent to the Persian Gulf on Sunday, including the 350-person Marine 
Medium Helicopter Squadron 166 from Tustin Marine Air Corps Station that was 
deployed in June to the Indian Ocean and moved in ships off the coast of Kuwait 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder of the 18,000 Marines from Pendleton will be called for duty in 
the Gulf, the Pentagon said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing camouflage battle fatigues and carrying gas masks and M-16 rifles, all 
spoke of sudden goodbys, of wives and children who have learned in recent years 
that the Marines are the nation's "911 squad," as one put it, ready to fly off 
in a matter of hours into a distant hot spot. 
</P>
<P>
 At least half had seen action during the Persian Gulf War nearly four years 
ago, and some seemed eager to go back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we can go over . . . and do what we should have done the first time," 
said a 25-year-old corporal based at Twentynine Palms, referring to the fact 
that Hussein remains in power. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine Sgt. Keith Luzbetak, 25, also based at Twentynine Palms, said simply: 
"This is what we are trained to do. When the balloon goes up, we go." 
</P>
<P>
 Luzbetak went to the Persian Gulf during Desert Storm, but this time around he 
has a 6-month-old daughter to think about. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just the life I lead," he said. "That's what's entailed in being a 
Marine and a father at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Mark Fernandez, a 30-year-old tank mechanic, said the wives and husbands 
left behind by war or preparations for war always have to take on additional 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got to be mother and father all by herself," Fernandez said of his 
pregnant wife, Yvonn, who will also be caring for an 8-year-old son and a 
2-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 He said every mission away -- whether for combat or for training -- reminds 
him anew of how quickly children grow up and how much he misses when he is 
gone. "I don't see the kids for a while and then I come back and they're 
totally different." 
</P>
<P>
 Marines from Camp Pendleton and Twentynine Palms not only served in the Gulf 
War, they have been back to Kuwait every year since to participate in a drill 
called Native Fury. They have also participated in extensive desert training 
exercises in northern Africa and were part of the humanitarian relief and 
security missions in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Col. Jerry Broeckert, a spokesman at Camp Pendleton, said the most 
important thing for troops being called up is to make arrangements so that 
their families will be cared for while they are away. 
</P>
<P>
 He said support groups are being formed to help family members left behind 
with what is a sometimes difficult period of adjustment after troops head for 
possible battle. 
</P>
<P>
 With the standoff between Hussein and Kuwaiti ground forces continuing, it was 
impossible for these Marines to know how long they will be gone or what, 
exactly, they will do after completing the initial task of making sure that 
fighting forces will be well-equipped and ready to hit the ground running. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines who flew out from this base Sunday are part of a U.S.-led 
mobilization of up to 38,000 troops as well as aircraft and warships to counter 
Hussein's deployment of nearly 70,000 Iraqi troops near the Kuwaiti border. 
Four U.S. Navy ships carrying 2,000 Marines are nearing the northern Gulf, and 
4,000 Marines are due to arrive in Kuwait in the next day or so. 
</P>
<P>
 At 12:30 p.m. Sunday, a sergeant began calling off the names of those in the 
all-male unit assembled at March AFB, and they began forming a line beside a 
bulky green transport plane. Some stood bareheaded under the hot sun and 
unseasonably clear blue sky, while others wore canvas hats or helmets. A few 
joked quietly among themselves, but many seemed almost grim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to go and do what I have to do . . . and hopefully be home before 
Christmas," said Cpl. Damien Gray, a pink-cheeked, 21-year-old mechanic from 
Pennsylvania who sports a barely noticeable blond mustache. 
</P>
<P>
 Master Sgt. Lee brought up the rear. The way he described the unit's mission 
made it seem almost like a counseling session rather than part of the process 
of preparing for a possible war. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to teach them how to get along," he said. "Everybody in the world 
needs to learn to get along." 
</P>

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; HUFFINGTON'S WIFE RUNS CAMPAIGN, EX-AIDES 
SAY; FIVE FORMER STAFFERS IN THE ELECTION BID CLAIM THEY QUIT DUE TO 
DISAGREEMENTS WITH HER. SHE INSISTS THAT THEY WERE FIRED AND THAT HER ROLE IN 
THE RACE IS MINOR. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Several former top staff members in Republican Rep. Mike Huffington's U.S. 
Senate campaign say the candidate's wife, Arianna, is essentially running 
campaign operations, despite her contention that she has been playing a minor 
role. 
</P>
<P>
 Five former Huffington employees told The Times that they were among eight 
staff members who quit their jobs in the campaign during a three-week period in 
August because of disagreements with Arianna Huffington's decision-making at 
the Orange County headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not think it was in the best interest of the Republican Party, the 
state of California and -- given her ambitions -- the nation for that matter, 
to elect her to the U.S. Senate," said Lauri Shirck-Twomey, who served as 
statewide finance director for Huffington. "And that's essentially what we were 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Another added: "She is the campaign manager in the traditional sense of the 
word. Whatever anybody else tells you, she is running the place. Nobody makes a 
move without telling her." 
</P>
<P>
 Arianna Huffington's role in the Senate campaign has been an issue since the 
primary, when Republican challenger William Dannemeyer accused Huffington of 
avoiding public forums and sending his wife instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has heightened recently since she became the subject of several 
national media stories -- including a week of "Doonesbury" comic strips -- 
about her participation in a controversial worldwide religious group, 
John-Roger's Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 Arianna Huffington, a noted author, socialite and national lecturer, has 
bristled at the scrutiny, saying she does not think her personal beliefs should 
be an issue because she is only a minor helper in her husband's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a tremendous reach . . . to try and give it some legitimacy (by) saying 
I am involved in the campaign," she said in a lengthy interview last week at 
the couple's Westside apartment. "I mean, I am involved in the campaign, but I 
don't know many campaign wives who are not involved in their campaigns. I am 
not involved with the day-to-day running of the office." 
</P>
<P>
 During a debate last week, Mike Huffington, locked in a close race with 
Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, also sharply criticized the attention his 
wife has been given. "I'm the candidate; my wife is not the candidate," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Huffingtons declined to comment Sunday on the statements by former 
campaign employees. The campaign issued a brief statement saying: "Disgruntled 
ex-employees are notoriously unreliable sources for what's happening where they 
were formerly employed, and this occasion provides no exception to this rule." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not uncommon for campaigns to undergo staff turnover during a heated 
race. But it is rare for ex-staff members to speak out about their former 
employers. The community of California Republican consultants is not large, and 
loyalty is highly regarded by future employers. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, however, Shirck-Twomey and former campaign manager Bob Schuman 
said they decided to speak publicly after hearing Arianna Huffington's 
contention that the former staff members did not quit, but were fired. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody quit the campaign," Arianna Huffington said last week. "Everybody who 
is no longer there was let go -- and that's an important distinction. . . . 
There is no doubt in this campaign that Michael's is the final word. . . . If 
somebody wasn't performing, the easiest excuse is that they were not getting 
along with the wife. . . . But the fact is that there was no performance." 
</P>
<P>
 But Schuman, who is still on the payroll as an adviser to the GOP effort, 
said, "That is just categorically untrue regarding everybody who left the 
campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Schuman, who served as campaign manager for about five months until August, 
declined to discuss his own experiences at the campaign or his reasons for 
leaving the manager's post. He said he was only concerned about protecting the 
professional reputations of the employees who left the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Four former staff members spoke with The Times on the condition that their 
names not be used. They said that Schuman quit his job as campaign manager and 
returned to his home in San Diego because he could not work with Arianna 
Huffington. "He was supposed to be the campaign manager, and they would not let 
him manage," one said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Shirck-Twomey, most of the former campaign staff members said they 
maintained their support for the GOP candidate. They said, however, that his 
wife was steering the campaign at a cost to the candidate's chances. 
</P>
<P>
 They said Arianna Huffington's interest in promoting the ideas in her most 
recent book -- "The Fourth Instinct, The Call of the Soul" -- was sometimes 
perceived by staff members to be a higher priority than winning the Senate 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, they said there were times when she would sacrifice what was 
considered most prudent for political strategy in order to gain a platform for 
her views. "To be honest, it got kind of confusing as to whether Arianna was 
going out as a public relations campaign for her book or for the political 
campaign," said one staff member. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirck-Twomey, a 12-year veteran of state and national campaign finance 
operations, said the contrast between Arianna Huffington's priorities and the 
political professionals was most apparent in August when the campaign began to 
highlight a plan to replace government welfare with private charity -- an idea 
elaborated in her book. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirck-Twomey said the campaign spent $4 million on a series of television 
commercials on the subject despite advice from senior political consultants 
that it was a waste of money since the issue was not a priority for voters. 
</P>
<P>
 While Huffington has spent more than $10 million of his personal fortune on 
the campaign, Shirck-Twomey's job was to try to raise money from other sources. 
She said Arianna Huffington insisted that the issue of volunteerism be 
highlighted in the letters she was sending to Republican contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (professional consultants) concurred that a direct-mail piece calling on 
people to volunteer (to help the poor) would not raise money," Shirck-Twomey 
said. "Primarily, there are some hot topics that get traditional Republican 
givers to give -- crime, taxes and defense. Volunteering for your community is 
just not a salient issue. They were told this is foolish, you are going to lose 
money, don't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some also said their ability to work was hampered by a requirement from the 
candidate's wife that some staff members donate their time at least twice a 
week to homeless shelters in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Huffington's campaign headquarters was described by the former staff 
members as a chaotic office with no clear lines of authority and a work force 
broken into hostile camps. They said their jobs became impossible because she 
frequently questioned their loyalty to the campaign and confused the staff by 
regularly second-guessing their decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "She viewed everybody who came there as a future member in some social crusade 
that has something to do with the ideas she has in her book," one ex-staffer 
said. "I felt this need from an individual to have total control over you and 
your function was just to execute her directions and orders. . . . But (they) 
were bringing in people who have experience; we're not just kids starting out."

MEDFLY PESSIMISTS SAY VICTORY IMPOSSIBLE; AGRICULTURE: VENTURA COUNTY 
INFESTATION UNDERSCORES TENACITY OF INSECT. THE PEST HAS SURFACED ELSEWHERE IN 
CALIFORNIA AFTER EACH CLAIM OF ERADICATION. 
</P>

 Fruit will be quarantined. Fields will be sprayed. Flies will be trapped. 
</P>
<P>
 But will Ventura County ever be rid of the dreaded Medfly? 
</P>
<P>
 That question has sent bug experts from across the state buzzing to their file 
cabinets, as they root through case histories from the past 15 years in search 
of battle plans and crystal balls. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Medfly specialists approve of the county's attack so far -- the intensive 
trapping efforts, the quarantine on fruit grown near the infestation, the plans 
for aerial spraying of the pesticide malathion. They differ sharply, however, 
when it comes to predicting results. 
</P>
<P>
 Optimists say Ventura County will slide out of the crisis quickly, with 
minimal damage, by killing every last Mediterranean fruit fly in the next half 
a year. "I am confident that we (can) achieve eradication," said Douglas 
Hendrix, spokesman for a joint state and federal task force charged with 
battling the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
 But other experts dismiss such bullish assurances. In their grim view, Ventura 
County is doomed to suffer wave after wave of infestation during the next few 
decades, a devastating cycle that could ultimately crush the county's 
agricultural industry, worth $848 million in crop sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of all the counties that have been infested, there has never, never, never 
been one that was dis-infested," warned Jim Carey, a professor of entomology at 
UC Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a creeping fungus that continually moves to expand its range, yard by 
yard, property by property." 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers, scientists, environmentalists and bureaucrats have studied the Medfly 
since its first appearance in Southern California in 1975. They have tracked 
the blue-eyed pests from feast to feast, battling the fruit-gobbling insects 
from Santa Clara to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all their research, they have failed to reach consensus on three key 
questions: 
</P>
<P>
 How does the Medfly flit from county to county? 
</P>
<P>
 How well do eradication programs work? 
</P>
<P>
 How can bug zappers vanquish the voracious insects without harming the people 
who live nearby? 
</P>
<P>
 Spot eradication programs have won praise in half a dozen counties. A 
combination of quarantines, aerial and ground spraying, and the release of 
sterilized Medflies diminishes the pest population dramatically -- for a time. 
</P>
<P>
 But as soon as state officials triumphantly declare that they have achieved 
eradication, the Medfly crops up elsewhere. Like the plastic gophers in county 
fair games, which sink under a hammer blow to the head and then pop up grinning 
in an adjacent hole, the Medfly seems invincible. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer of 1990, for example, officials said they had succeeded in 
banishing the pest from Southern California. Just one year later, a pregnant 
Medfly was discovered in a peach tree near Koreatown in Los Angeles. An 
intensive trapping effort uncovered 200 more Medflies in the area by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medfly's survival skill taunts activists such as Lisabeth Hush, who 
suffered eye irritation, accelerated heartbeat and other symptoms during the 
1989 malathion spraying over the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 Hush believes the government's anti-Medfly policies are more show than 
substance. The spraying may prove to Japanese trading partners that California 
is tough on pests, she says, but it does not conquer the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no entomology in California," Hush said. "It's all based on 
politics." 
</P>
<P>
 But state and federal officials insist that they can -- and do -- eradicate 
the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, they said, is that the Medfly is constantly reintroduced, despite 
the strict quarantines. Tourists may smuggle in maggot-ridden tomatoes from 
Central America. Hawaiians may send fly-infested papayas to relatives in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 That's all it takes. Within months, the fast-breeding critters can produce 
enough offspring to spark another crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing makes me madder than people bringing fruit back from Hawaii," said 
Deena Gerry, whose family has tended a citrus grove near Camarillo since the 
1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 Her son, Will Gerry, added: "People pick up mangoes in Hawaii, stuff them into 
their suitcases, and then when they get home and open them they say, 'Eeew, 
look at these bugs,' and throw them in the trash." 
</P>
<P>
 Unless infested produce is double-bagged, sealed and placed in covered 
containers, the maggots can crawl out and begin breeding. 
</P>
<P>
 The state and the federal government try to prevent such accidental 
infestations by policing quarantine boundaries to be sure no one illegally 
transports fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Fruit-sniffing beagles at Los Angeles International Airport and the Port of 
Long Beach inspect baggage in an effort to root out contraband and enforce the 
1,500-square-mile quarantine zone that spans four counties in the Los Angeles 
Basin. In the past, federal officials have even launched sting operations at 
local post offices to check for fruit sent in parcels. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from such traditional ports of entry, Ventura County's quarantine covers 
86 square miles surrounding "ground zero" -- the low-slung fig tree on the 
grounds of St. John's Seminary in Camarillo where the first two Medflies were 
discovered Sept. 29. Most crops within the zone, including citrus and avocados, 
must be treated before shipment. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar quarantine, combined with aggressive aerial spraying, squashed the 
Medfly threat in six months in Riverside County earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the quarantine caused some penny-pinching, farmers there bounced back 
remarkably well. They now seek to reassure Ventura County's growers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were much more concerned than we needed to be," Riverside County farmer 
Charles Colladay said. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of Colladay's 2,000-acre ranch landed in the quarantine zone, which 
radiated from the city of Corona. He was able to treat the quarantined produce 
with malathion for about $60 an acre -- a price covering five applications of 
the pesticide, timed to kill each emerging generation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a scary thing when we went into it . . . but things just went like 
clockwork," Colladay said. A firm believer that Medflies can be conquered, 
Colladay praised the state's eradication program with a simple endorsement: "It 
works." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Riverside method -- eight aerial sprays, separated by six to 10 days 
-- remains controversial. Environmentalists and city officials raised a ruckus 
in Corona, going to court in an unsuccessful attempt to block the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 Noel Otten, research director for the Burbank-based anti-spraying group Action 
Now, said he believes bureaucrats "have an agenda to falsely reassure the 
public about malathion." 
</P>
<P>
 A brace of scientific studies, though, backs the official word that malathion 
is safe. A common back-yard pesticide, it does not cause cancer or birth 
defects and poses "no significant health hazard," according to the state 
Department of Health. 
</P>
<P>
 It does, however, carry a significant price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cooperative Medfly Project, a task force funded by state and federal tax 
dollars, spent $100 million from 1980 to 1982 to wipe out the Medfly in Santa 
Clara County. The group revived the strategy seven years later to battle 
Medflies in the Los Angeles Basin, at a cost of $65 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the aerial spraying was declared effective in 1990, the Medflies 
popped up again a year later. This time, political opposition blocked the 
aerial application of malathion bait, a potent substance that tricks adult 
insects into drinking poison by lacing the pesticide with sweet corn syrup. 
</P>
<P>
 Without aerial sprays, the latest Los Angeles Basin eradication effort relies 
on the release of more than 400 million sterile Medflies each week. Officials 
hope the sterile insects will mate with fertile ones, thus thinning the ranks 
of future generations. 
</P>
<P>
 The sterile fly program, plus routine trapping and quarantine enforcement, 
cost $26 million last year. And it seems to be working -- the number of flies 
found in the Los Angeles Basin has plummeted, from about 400 last year to only 
seven so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything seems to have calmed down a lot because of the sterile fly 
releases," said Bob Wyatt, legislative director for the Orange County Farm 
Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 But sterile fly labs in Hawaii and Guatemala are working at full capacity to 
meet demands for the Los Angeles Basin. And state officials have expressed 
doubt that any sterile flies will be available for Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated by such roadblocks, entomologist Carey has called for an "AIDS-like 
research program to come up with a long-term approach to dealing with the 
Medfly problem." 
</P>
<P>
 While most agricultural officials continue to hope that the Medfly can be 
wiped out with spot eradication efforts, Carey forecasts continual costly 
battles against the pest -- battles that could sink some farmers and trigger a 
much-feared Asian boycott of California produce. 
</P>
<P>
 "This Ventura County find is absolutely predictable," he said. "We're lurching 
from outbreak to outbreak here. . . . We have got to develop and implement a 
major research program to supplement our brush-fire approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "This thing isn't the flu; it's a cancer. So we can't just treat the symptoms 
-- we have to go after the disease itself."

SCHULLER TO SHOW TV BROADCAST IN MOVIE THEATERS WORLDWIDE; RELIGION: CRYSTAL 
CATHEDRAL MINISTER PLANS TO PRODUCE HIS CHURCH SERVICES AS FILMS AFTER LOSING 
ACCESS TO MUCH OF HIS RUSSIAN AND EUROPEAN AUDIENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with a blackout in Russia and the loss of 90% of his European television 
audience after losing access to a major satellite network, the Rev. Robert H. 
Schuller on Sunday disclosed an unprecedented end run to bolster his worldwide 
broadcast ministry -- by returning to low-tech. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when global communications have become instantaneous, Schuller said 
he will put his weekly "Hour of Power" television program on film to be shown 
on a delayed basis every Sunday morning in theaters worldwide. His goal is to 
have screenings in 2,000 theaters within two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here today to tell you God has given us a new dream," Schuller told 
worshipers at the landmark Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove. "We will be the 
first ministry in history to produce a church service as a movie." 
</P>
<P>
 First screenings are scheduled later this month in Australia. By November, 
half a dozen theaters will be lined up in Holland, Germany and Switzerland, 
along with 30 theaters in the United States, including eight to 10 in Southern 
California, Schuller aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California theaters have agreed to broadcast the services 
rent-free, they said, but initial costs, which include a nationwide advertising 
campaign, are estimated at $500,000 through this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuller, known for his gospel of positive thinking, said that what may have 
been seen as adversity represents a new opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuller lost access to Europe's Super Channel in January after NBC acquired a 
75% stake in the network and launched a major overhaul of its programming. It 
is seeking to attract a wider audience with a combination of information and 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuller, whose "Hour of Power" reached 200,000 viewers over the network, told 
his congregation, "They have a 'no religion' policy. They discriminate against 
Christianity." 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, he added, "If the railroad can't deliver my product, maybe I 
need a truck driver!" 
</P>
<P>
 Three months ago, Schuller lost another 10 million to 15 million viewers when 
he was taken off government-owned Channel 1 in Russia because, a Schuller 
spokesman said, the government's financial problems forced it to temporarily 
cut back on programming. Schuller hopes that Channel 1 will resume his 
broadcast by the end of the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Schuller said Sunday, his viewing audience worldwide is 20 million, 
including 2.5 million viewers in the United States and about 2,000 in England 
and Europe who receive signals from the pay-per-view SKY satellite. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Nason, a longtime aide and spokesman for Schuller, said the one silver 
lining in the recent developments is that SKY has agreed to descramble its 
signal to offer Schuller's "Hour of Power" free. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuller said he will continue to seek new television outlets for his program, 
but is more enthusiastic about the possibilities of appearing on the big 
screen. He joked with his congregation Sunday about being stunned at seeing his 
own enormous image. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could hear him breathe," he said of the theater screen preacher. "He was as 
close to me as if I were only four feet away. There was a presence there!" 
</P>
<P>
 Schuller was not unmindful of the irony of turning to an old medium -- 
celluloid -- in a high-tech world. For him, though, it is back to the future -- 
he began his ministry 40 years ago preaching at a drive-in movie theater in 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you could say Schuller hasn't made much progress. He's back in the 
theater," Schuller joked between services. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference this time is that he will be on 35-millimeter film in full 
Dolby sound. Schuller believes that his approach is on the cutting edge, Nason 
said. "It's the biggest thing in evangelism in decades," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuller said his weekly worship service, which is taped for television 
rebroadcast, will be transferred to film and screened about three to four weeks 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 By providing the television program in a theater setting, Schuller is betting 
that many viewers who do not attend church would be willing to leave their 
homes to go to a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what," he told reporters, "it might not work at all. But to 
guarantee failure is not to try. . . . If it catches on, by golly, we can see 
churches coming back on Main Street!" 
</P>
<P>
 Schuller said he would be happy if just 15 to 20 people showed up for a 
viewing. He is not attempting to start new churches, he said, but draw those 
who are not affiliated with a church and refer them to a church of their choice 
where counseling, worship, Bible study and other services would be available. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be the first time some of these viewers can see the eyes and face 
and touch the hand of someone who is a Christian," Schuller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuller said no collection plate would be passed, although there would be one 
in the rear of the theaters for contributions. In Australia, some thought is 
being given to selling admission tickets, but elsewhere admission would be 
free. The film would be edited to exclude announcements and the offertory. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately known what impact the loss of the Super Channel had on 
the ministry's annual $45-million budget or how the Crystal Cathedral might be 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
 The landmark church has at times been heavily subsidized by broadcast income. 
Between 1980 and 1986, the TV ministry gave $14.7 million to the Crystal 
Cathedral to keep the congregation afloat, according to a published report in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 By late 1991, however, church officials said that the broadcast subsidies had 
stopped and that the local congregation was self-sustaining with an annual 
income of $5 million. There is now one budget for both the Crystal Cathedral 
and Schuller's broadcast ministry.

SARAJEVO AID FLIGHTS RESUME; PEACEKEEPERS BEEF UP PATROLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aid flights resumed Sunday and U.N. peacekeepers beefed up patrols in 
Sarajevo, a city in mourning after a Serb sniper attack on streetcars killed 
one person and wounded 11. 
</P>
<P>
 With food dwindling to a three-day supply for the 360,000 residents of the 
Bosnian capital, 19 U.N. and two Red Cross planes rushed aid to Sarajevo on 
Sunday in anticipation of colder months and a possible Serb shutdown of the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the summer, the international airlift was suspended frequently, and it 
had been shut down since Sept. 22, when NATO planes struck a Bosnian Serb tank. 
Aid flights resumed Friday, only to be called off after both government and 
Serb forces fired on planes at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. spokesman Maj. Herve Gourmelon said the Serbs cleared seven food convoys 
for transit across Bosnia on Sunday, but again refused permits for fuel 
convoys. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarajevo's mood was somber after Saturday's sniper attack on trams in central 
Sarajevo. Among the wounded were five children. Gourmelon said the fire came 
from Bosnian Serb positions around the Jewish cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinforced anti-sniper teams patrolled "sniper alley" Sunday to try to prevent 
a repeat of Saturday's attack, Gourmelon said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,100 shooting incidents were recorded Saturday, one of the highest 
totals in recent months, he said. In Serb-held Ilijas, on Sarajevo's 
northwestern outskirts, two children were killed when an artillery round hit 
Saturday, U.N. peacekeepers said.

AUSTRIAN RIGHTIST'S PARTY MAKES STRONG ELECTION GAINS; EUROPE: GOVERNING 
COALITION LOSES TWO-THIRDS PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY AS HAIDER'S FREEDOM PARTY 
GETS 23% OF VOTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The party led by a right-wing populist who once praised the work ethic of Nazi 
Germany won 23% of the vote in Austria's federal elections Sunday, handing two 
moderate parties that have governed for four decades their worst setback since 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The charismatic Joerg Haider and his Freedom Party remained in the No. 3 spot 
in what will be a five-party Parliament, but their strong showing deprived the 
governing coalition of the Social Democrats and the conservative People's Party 
of the two-thirds majority it has always enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Most disturbing for the established political parties of this placid, alpine 
nation of 7.5 million was the post position Haider has staked out for the 1998 
federal campaign -- a vote that could put the telegenic 44-year-old in the 
chancellor's seat if current political trends continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Haider, confident and smiling, thanked his supporters and set their sights on 
the leadership in 1998. He also ventured the opinion that the two parties that 
have dominated Austrian politics since this nation regained its postwar 
independence in 1955 would split up even before their new four-year term is 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
 Haider is expected to try to exploit disaffection among the conservatives of 
the People's Party, luring them into a coalition with his rightists and against 
the Social Democrats, whom he has cast as politically stagnant and corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, appearing on Austrian television, looked shaken by 
what he termed "certainly poor results," and the general secretary of his 
Social Democratic Party, Josef Cap, described the voting as "a clear defeat." 
</P>
<P>
 Vranitzky was expected to be nominated for a fourth term as chancellor, and 
the current coalition is likely to be reconstituted, because the two leading 
parties can cobble together the simple majority needed to govern. 
</P>
<P>
 But influential conservatives like Foreign Minister Alois Mock have lately 
hinted they might one day side with Haider to drive the leftist Social 
Democrats into opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as a third-party force in the 183-seat Parliament, the Freedom Party with 
its 42 seats now will be able to assert broad influence over this nation's 
policies with its vital swing vote on constitutional issues that require a 
two-thirds majority to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The governing coalition parties commanded 75% of the previous Parliament, but 
their strength now drops to about 63%, requiring the support of one or more of 
the polarized opposition parties on key issues like Austria's expected Jan. 1 
entry into the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The leftist Green Alternative party also gained at the expense of the 
established parties, boosting its 4.8% share in the Parliament to 7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Vranitzky's Social Democrats lost the most to the resurgent smaller parties, 
dropping from nearly 43% of the votes in the last federal election to slightly 
more than 35%, with 66 seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The People's Party also fell in the vote spread, getting only 28% and 52 
seats, in comparison with 32% of the votes in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 In his eight years as Freedom Party leader, Haider has taken his xenophobic 
following from obscurity to the threshold of power. He has shown himself to be 
adept at overcoming setbacks, such as his vocal opposition to joining the 
European Union before a June referendum that gave 66% endorsement to Austria's 
proposed membership. 
</P>
<P>
 He lost a provincial governorship in 1991 amid the scandal that followed his 
remark that certain aspects of the economic and industrial policies of Adolf 
Hitler were to be admired. 
</P>
<P>
 But his ranting against the influx of foreigners, whom he accuses of taking 
jobs that would otherwise go to Austrians, has won him burgeoning support in 
this country, where cradle-to-grave social security has begun to erode.

THATCHER'S SON REPORTEDLY GOT MILLIONS FROM SAUDI ARMS DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Labor Party officials called Sunday for a parliamentary investigation into 
charges that Mark Thatcher, the son of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, 
reaped millions of dollars in arms sales commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor spokesman Robin Cook urged that the government set up an inquiry into 
allegations that Mark Thatcher, 41, helped broker a British arms deal to Saudi 
Arabia worth a reported $35 billion in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a long report in the London Sunday Times, middlemen in the arms 
deal -- which involved aircraft, warships and ammunition -- received about $360 
million for their services. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Sunday Times and the Independent on Sunday said Mark Thatcher earned 
a $19-million commission for helping secure the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Then-Prime Minister Thatcher played an active role in winning the Saudi deal 
against fierce foreign competition, visiting Riyadh, the Saudi capital, in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunday Times did not suggest that Mark Thatcher, who is married to an 
American and lives in Dallas, did anything illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 But it questioned the ethics of the prime minister's actions in allowing her 
son to become involved in a deal between the British arms makers and the Saudi 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Thatcher liked to lecture the rest of us on the need to stand on our own 
two feet and not to accept handouts," Cook said. "She now stands accused of 
letting her own son use her public position to feather his own nest with the 
biggest handout on record." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunday Times said the allegations that Mark Thatcher profited heavily were 
confirmed by transcripts of telephone calls tapped by Saudi intelligence 
between members of the Saudi royal family and its agents in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The source of Mark Thatcher's wealth has long been a subject of speculation in 
Britain: Almost overnight, he went from an ordinary accountant to a man with a 
fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Labor lawmaker Tam Dalyell asked the government to confirm or deny 
that Mark Thatcher had received millions from the deal between Britain and 
Saudi Arabia -- without success. 
</P>

 But he promised Sunday, "I shall return to the subject when the House of 
Commons reassembles, as I believe that this whole case should be pursued in 
Parliament." 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations are expected to roil a Conservative Party conference this 
week, which the former prime minister is scheduled to attend.

WASHINGTON OUTLOOK: '94 CANDIDATES AGREE ON 1 GOAL: CURBING JUVENILE CRIME; BUT 
ANY CRACKDOWN COULD BE JUST A WARM-UP TO AN EVEN TOUGHER CLASH WHEN WELFARE 
REFORM IS TACKLED 
</P>

<P>
 Call it tough love, common standards or fear and loathing, but one of the most 
powerful trends in campaign 1994 is the rising demand for a crackdown on 
juvenile criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 With juvenile violence rising more rapidly than adult violence, promises of 
boot camps, longer sentences, adult trials and curfews for teen-agers are 
ringing through campaigns around the country, especially gubernatorial races. 
This is an agenda with an angry edge -- filled with denunciations of punks and 
thugs and hoodlums. But even so, it may be only the warm-up for a more 
polarizing conflict next year, when the likelihood is that anxiety over youth 
crime will become intertwined with the racially charged effort to reform the 
welfare system. 
</P>
<P>
 The first stage of this process -- stiffening sanctions against violent 
juveniles -- amounts to a tidal wave. At least 20 states this year moved to 
prosecute more violent juveniles as adults, thereby allowing courts to impose 
longer sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 In Texas, George W. Bush, the Republican gubernatorial nominee, calls juvenile 
violence the most important problem in the state; he wants to lower to 14 the 
age at which juveniles can be tried as adults. California Gov. Pete Wilson has 
already signed such a bill into law. In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Roy Romer led 
a special session last fall that created a new system of longer sentences and 
secure incarceration for juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, this may represent nothing less than a rejection of the juvenile 
justice system erected at the turn of the century to protect and reform wayward 
young people charged with delinquency or petty theft. In the era of killers not 
yet old enough to shave, the stern new guiding principle appears to be that, 
whatever the defendant's age, "every criminal act of an offender must translate 
into a definite consequence," as Peter Ramirez of the New York City family 
court puts it. 
</P>
<P>
 Stiffer sanctions against violent juveniles, however, constitute only the 
first (and relatively less incendiary) step in a broader reassessment. A 
growing number of candidates in both parties, but especially Republicans, are 
linking the rise in juvenile violence with the growth in out-of-wedlock births 
and welfare dependency. Jeb Bush, the GOP gubernatorial nominee in Florida, 
puts it flatly: "The pathology of the welfare state is, I think, the primary 
reason why we have . . . juvenile crime." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, research doesn't support such a blanket statement. 
</P>
<P>
 An exhaustive Justice Department review of sociological studies recently 
concluded that children from single-parent families are more likely to engage 
in delinquent and criminal behavior, and that crime rates are higher in 
neighborhoods with high proportions of mother-only families. 
</P>
<P>
 But millions of children grow up in single-parent households without becoming 
delinquents or criminals. The high rates of crime in neighborhoods with lots of 
single mothers could also reflect other factors, like racial segregation or 
poverty, researchers note. And other forms of dysfunction in "intact" families 
can also predict criminal behavior: child abuse, criminal activity by parents 
and marital discord. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not all children follow the same path to delinquency," the review concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the relationship between father absence and crime appears strong enough 
-- especially in isolated inner-city neighborhoods -- to force the issue of 
broken families into the juvenile crime debate. And that, in turn, is 
increasing discussion of what Princeton University criminologist John J. 
DiIulio terms the "most radical of radical social program proposals": an 
increased effort by government to guide the upbringing of children raised 
fatherless and poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Put another way, what we are hearing is the opening notes of a movement to 
bring back the orphanage. 
</P>
<P>
 This call is coming from two directions. Social conservatives like William J. 
Bennett and Charles Murray see orphanages as a way to care for children who 
could otherwise be left destitute by their proposals to cut off all welfare 
benefits for single mothers, in the hope of discouraging illegitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
 More intriguingly, criminologists like DiIulio are pushing the idea of 
orphanage-like institutions as a means of removing children from surroundings 
that raise their risk of involvement in crime. The leader in this modest 
movement has been UCLA management professor James Q. Wilson. In an article last 
month in Commentary, Wilson renewed his call for "group homes" with strict 
rules and supervision, where single, teen-age parents and their children could 
live in "the kind of structured, consistent and nurturant environment that 
children need." 
</P>
<P>
 In looking to modernize and adapt the orphanage, these writers are championing 
an institution long out of favor. For years, the clear preference of social 
welfare agencies has been to keep children in families, even those that only 
loosely deserve the name; the Census Bureau now counts fewer than 25,000 
children living in long-term care facilities like orphanages. 
</P>
<P>
 Those numbers reflect the modern image of the orphanage as a close cousin to 
the prison. But that judgment is too sweeping. A study in the Atlantic Monthly 
of contemporary orphanages like the Children's Village in New York found many 
cheerful and effective: "An institution may be the first home some children 
have ever known," concluded Mary-Lou Weisman. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at this early stage, orphanage advocates are dividing into two camps: 
hard and soft. The hard side leans toward separating children from their 
parents, either by legal fiat or by eliminating the public assistance that 
parents need to keep their family together. That seems like a dead end: It is 
difficult to imagine Americans accepting a policy that coerces women in 
significant numbers to give up their children. 
</P>
<P>
 But the approach of soft-siders could offer more grounds for experiment and 
consensus. UCLA's Wilson says that, except in the extreme cases that require 
removal, the goal should be to keep young single mothers with their children -- 
but to relocate both to a safer and more structured environment operated by 
private institutions like churches, with government financial support. 
</P>
<P>
 The left's initial reaction may be to recoil from such an idea as coercive 
itself; but liberals should think twice. While demanding more responsibility 
from young mothers (curfews, progress toward high school graduation), such 
institutions could also offer them more comprehensive services (health care, 
parenting classes, immunizations) than they now receive. 
</P>
<P>
 The rub is the cost. Mary Jo Bane, an assistant secretary at the Health and 
Human Services Department, says successful orphanages now spend from $30,000 to 
$50,000 annually per child -- "as much as it costs to run a prison or nursing 
home." Even converting welfare grants into vouchers that could be used to buy 
such services for children, as Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) and 
conservative House Republicans are suggesting, wouldn't cover even a fraction 
of that bill, she notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Could institutions be designed that would provide comparable services at less 
cost? No one knows. That's one reason to proceed cautiously. But at a time when 
states are minting dollars to punish violent juveniles, it makes sense to at 
least experiment with new means of helping young people stay out of trouble in 
the first place. 
</P>

Arrests

 For most violent crimes, arrest rates for juveniles have been rising faster 
than the arrest rates for adults -- fueling the nationwide turn toward 
toughening sentences for youthful criminals. In 1992, children younger than 18 
committed more than twice as many murders as in 1983, and almost twice as many 
aggravated assaults.

CHRISTOPHER LAUDS OVERTURE BY SYRIA; MIDEAST: SECRETARY OF STATE KICKS OFF HIS 
MEDIATION MISSION BY PRAISING DAMASCUS OFFICIAL'S 'SYMBOLIC' INTERVIEW ON 
ISRAELI TV. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The atmosphere for peace talks between Israel and Syria has never been more 
favorable than it is now as a result of recent attempts by Damascus to appeal 
to Israeli public opinion, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting a weeklong mediation mission that will take him to Jerusalem and 
Damascus twice, Christopher cited a long and often contentious interview that 
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh gave to Israel's state-owned television 
as a demonstration of Syria's new attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said Shareh's "willingness to have an interview with an Israeli 
journalist is an important step toward reconciliation" even though the Syrian 
foreign minister's words echoed Damascus' traditional hard-line position. 
</P>
<P>
 "The interview was very significant in symbolic terms," Christopher said. "I 
would urge that attention be paid to that rather than just to the substance of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher noted that, during the Madrid conference that launched the current 
round of Mideast peace negotiations in 1991, Shareh refused to permit Israeli 
reporters to attend what had been billed as an open news conference, speaking 
only when all Israelis had been escorted from the room. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli Cabinet discussed the Shareh interview in generally favorable 
terms during its weekly meeting Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said it was a "positive step" for Shareh to talk 
directly to the Israeli public, but he denounced the substance of the foreign 
minister's remarks, especially a claim that Syrian troops never shelled Israeli 
civilian targets during the wars between the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin, Israel's army chief of staff during the 1967 Middle East War, said the 
Syrians repeatedly shelled Israeli communities from positions in the Golan 
Heights, a strategic plateau that Israel captured during that conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golan is the central issue in the Israel-Syria negotiations. Syria demands 
the return of all of the captured territory as a condition for peace. Israel 
has said it will consider a partial withdrawal but insists that Syria must 
first indicate whether it is ready to exchange ambassadors, open the border and 
take other steps in exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Environment Minister Yossi Sarid said the interview was an important 
gesture, but added: "I don't think the government is about to offer a deal of 
the Golan Heights in exchange" for a television program. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher urged Israelis to view the Syrian gesture in the context of other 
recent signs of an Arab-Israeli warming. 
</P>
<P>
 In a little more than a year, Israel has reached preliminary peace agreements 
with the Palestinians and Jordan, and has opened diplomatic contacts with 
Morocco and Syria. In addition, the oil-rich states of the Gulf Cooperation 
Council have agreed to stop enforcing the Arab boycott of companies that do 
business with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher meets today with Rabin, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and other 
Israeli officials. He is scheduled to go to Damascus on Tuesday to report the 
Israeli views to Syrian President Hafez Assad and to obtain the Syrian reply.

JERUSALEM GUNMEN KILL 2, WOUND 14 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A pair of gunmen opened fire with automatic weapons on a crowded downtown 
Jerusalem street, reportedly killing two people and wounding 14 Sunday night, 
Israeli army radio said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the wounded was an unidentified U.S. diplomat, wire services reported. 
U.S. consular officials could not immediately be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Two border police officers who happened to be in the area shot the gunmen to 
death minutes after the pair, who were believed to be Palestinians, opened 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The attackers, described by reporters on the scene as teen-agers, were armed 
with Kalashnikov automatic assault rifles and grenades. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobs quickly gathered downtown, shouting "Death to the terrorists" and "Rabin 
is a traitor," referring to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, as security 
forces combed the area for more gunmen. Police arrested several Palestinians 
and hustled them away from the angry crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 The bloody attack was the first in Jerusalem since Israel handed over the Gaza 
Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho to Palestinian control in May. 
</P>
<P>
 It occurred just blocks away from where U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher was staying at the King David Hotel. Christopher arrived Sunday 
morning at the start of a weeklong negotiating mission between Israel and 
Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization are scheduled to open a 
second round of talks today in Cairo on holding Palestinian elections in the 
West Bank and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials could not say Sunday night whether the attack would delay those 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunmen arrived in the Nahalat Shiva neighborhood of downtown Jerusalem 
shortly before midnight. They apparently parked a car near Independence Park 
and started walking toward Solomon Street, a historic pedestrian mall of stone 
buildings that house restaurants, pubs and boutiques. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the men started shooting indiscriminately at diners eating 
outside. Pandemonium erupted as people on the street returned fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sitting here in a restaurant and I heard shooting," said one 
unidentified witness, speaking to Israeli army radio minutes after the attack. 
"I pulled out my gun and went toward the shots. I saw a terrorist. He shot at 
me, then a border policeman shot him." 
</P>
<P>
 Many Israelis have permits to carry guns, and it is common in Jerusalem to see 
people wearing handguns tucked into their belts. 
</P>
<P>
 The wounded were taken to several Jerusalem hospitals. At least five were 
described as in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Security forces -- already beefed up for the Christopher visit -- poured into 
downtown, both to search for more gunmen and to control the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 On the scene moments after the attack, Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, joined by 
Israeli President Ezer Weizman, issued a plea on Israeli army radio for 
citizens to stay away from downtown.

STRONG EARTHQUAKE HITS EASTERN INDONESIA; 25 HURT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A strong earthquake shook a remote region in eastern Indonesia on Sunday, 
injuring 25 people and damaging scores of buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrified people ran into the streets after the quake, said Rahmat, a resident 
on the island of Bacan. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake's epicenter was about 135 miles south of the regional capital of 
Ternate, said Ariyo Fauzi of Indonesia's Meteorology and Geophysical Agency. 
The quake struck at 6:44 a.m. local time. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., measured the 
earthquake's magnitude at 6.9, while the Indonesian agency put the magnitude at 
6.3. Preliminary estimates often differ. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Sunday, an undersea earthquake in the Pacific shook northern Japan, the 
strongest aftershock of an 8.2-magnitude quake that killed 10 people in the 
Kuril Islands last week, authorities in Tokyo said. There were no reports of 
damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake had a preliminary magnitude of 7.3 and was centered in roughly the 
same place as Tuesday's quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's Central Meteorological Agency said the temblor was the strongest of 
nearly 70 aftershocks. The agency kept tidal wave warnings in effect as far 
south as Tokyo for two hours.

BUS KILLS 14 SUPPORTERS OF ARISTIDE; HAITI: DOZENS WOUNDED WHEN PRO-MILITARY 
ASSAILANT RAMS VEHICLE THROUGH DEMONSTRATION. DRIVER ESCAPES. 
</P>

<P>
 A pro-military assailant deliberately drove a bus through a crowd of several 
hundred demonstrators who were demanding the return of ousted President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide on Sunday, crushing and killing at least 14 people and 
severely wounding a dozen more, witnesses at the scene said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the bloodiest attack on pro-Aristide activists in months and came less 
than a week before Aristide is to return to power. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's followers have been emboldened by the presence of U.S. troops 
across the country, provoking attacks by paramilitaries. 
</P>
<P>
 In this town about 50 miles west of Port-au-Prince, witnesses said a truck had 
passed by the demonstration several minutes before the deadly bus did, and the 
truck's driver warned the marchers to watch out. He said the bus driver was a 
member of a paramilitary, anti-Aristide group known as FRAPH, and that he 
wanted to kill those in the rally. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told us the bus would kill us, but we did not believe it," one witness 
said. "We just kept on singing." 
</P>
<P>
 FRAPH, which stands for the Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haiti, 
has been a prime target of U.S. forces seeking to disarm illegal, paramilitary 
groups that have inflicted violence on civilians here since Aristide was 
overthrown. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar incident was reported near the northern city of St. Marc on Friday. 
At least three and perhaps seven people at a pro-Aristide rally reportedly were 
killed when a truck careened into the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, "a white bus came through at excessive speed, ran through the crowd 
and killed . . . people," said Capt. Kevin Donovan, leader of U.S. troops who 
arrived at the scene after the incident. "At least 12 more were evacuated to 
the hospital in Les Cayes (40 miles to the west). It was a pro-Aristide rally, 
and those in the bus were clearly trying to stop the demonstration. It was 
deliberate -- there is no question." 
</P>
<P>
 The predominant role of U.S. troops in the aftermath of the incident 
underscored how little public responsibility the Haitian army is assuming. 
While the U.S. troops picked up a handful of Haitian army soldiers on the way 
to the crash site, the Haitians huddled in a pickup truck while U.S. soldiers 
blocked the roads, picked up the bodies and dealt with the angry, stunned 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. troops arrived in Humvees to carry away the bodies sprawled in pools of 
blood. Hundreds of people who had been participating in the rally gathered in 
stunned silence broken only by the wailing of grief-stricken and shocked 
relatives. The demonstration was being held on National Route 2, a main highway 
that is not much traveled now because an international oil embargo has limited 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was waving leaves and shouting, 'Long live Aristide!' " said Jean 
Labard, 26, whose cousin was killed. "Suddenly a big white (bus) came racing 
through. It made S's, trying to run people over and crushing them. People were 
screaming, and it chased after them. It ran over them. We were screaming." 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of other participants gave similar accounts, describing in detail how 
the bus deliberately hit as many marchers as possible. Marches were being held 
across the region Sunday, and reporters passed several other large, peaceful 
gatherings of people waving branches and pictures of Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 Donovan said the license number and name of the bus -- "Thank You My God" -- 
had been turned over to the Haitian police and military. By late afternoon 
neither the bus nor the driver had been found.

SOUTHLAND MARINES READY, WAITING TO SEE WHO'LL GO; DEPLOYMENT: AS FIRST OF THE

 Standing outside Coach's Corner Sports Bar and Grill, Lance Cpl. David 
McCartney hugged two sobbing women who had just heard a rumor that their 
boyfriends -- both Camp Pendleton Marines -- might be deployed to the Persian 
Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is word-of-mouth right now," McCartney said as he tried to 
reassure the women. "People aren't sure who's going." 
</P>
<P>
 There was an air of uncertainty Sunday among Marines who frequent this seaside 
town, located at the north edge of the Camp Pendleton Marine base. They 
wondered how far the situation would escalate and if they would see combat, as 
Iraqi troops continued to mass near the Kuwaiti border. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst part is waiting to find out," said Lance Cpl. Joseph Garvey, 24. 
"My roommate is being called back (to the Persian Gulf). I'm willing to go too. 
That's my job." 
</P>
<P>
 What is known is this: 18,000 Camp Pendleton Marines will be sent to the 
Persian Gulf, the Pentagon said Sunday. About 700 Marines and sailors from 
Southern California have already been deployed, among them Marines from Tustin, 
who were sent in June to the Indian Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Departing Sunday from March Air Force Base near Riverside were about 300 
Marines from Camp Pendleton and Twentynine Palms, part of the First Marine 
Expeditionary Force, and about 65 sailors from San Diego, according to a 
military spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 They will meet up with the air combat element of the force -- about 350 pilots 
and support troops from Tustin Marine Corps Air Station called Marine Medium 
Helicopter Squadron 166. That squadron was shifted to the Gulf from its 
assignment in the Indian Ocean area, said Sgt. Dave Hiersekorn, a spokesman for 
the Tustin and El Toro Marine bases. 
</P>
<P>
 The squadron has been aboard four Navy ships on a routine mission in the area 
since June, Hiersekorn said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The unit just happened to be deployed in the Indian Ocean area at this time," 
Hiersekorn said. "They are in that theater of operations. They have been to 
Rwanda for a while. They've been all over." 
</P>
<P>
 Hiersekorn described the squadron as "the air combat element" in the 
2,000-soldier expeditionary force. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a self-contained force on the four ships," Hiersekorn said. "They 
come with their own food and their own supplies to be able to operate up to 15 
to 30 days without any resupply. They can respond to humanitarian assistance 
needs all the way to potential military combat, something like this." 
</P>
<P>
 "They can respond at short notice and sort of say, 'America is here and ready 
to deal with the situation,"' Hiersekorn said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the same unit, although not the same personnel, that made the initial 
landing in Somalia, Hiersekorn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Marines interviewed Sunday were not surprised that the United States was 
returning to the Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew we'd be back over there," Cpl. Richard Fielder said as he sat in a 
barber shop on El Camino Real, waiting for a haircut. "We should have done the 
job before. This is what happens when you go in and do something halfway. We 
could have gone in there and wiped them out." 
</P>
<P>
 Cpl. Wallace Addision, a Marine for five years who was stationed in Saudi 
Arabia during the Persian Gulf War, expressed similar sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hopes when I was there were that we would get it all over with at once," 
Addison said during a walk on the San Clemente Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we went back, it would be different," Addison added. "The way I see it, 
from the knowledge we gained, we'd make fewer mistakes. Iraq is not well 
equipped or well trained. It's still not a challenge for us. I hope it doesn't 
come to us having to fight, but if it does, I hope we finish it off. Stop it 
cold." 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Mark Klingan, 23, declined to discuss his personal feelings about the 
latest showdown with Iraq and simply said, "It's the job of every Marine to 
carry out government policy, not to question it. If we're sent to do the job, 
then we're going to do the job." 
</P>
<P>
 But others were not as stoic. A tearful Vicki Silverberg, 28, stood outside 
Coach's Corner -- a bar frequented by Camp Pendleton Marines -- commiserating 
with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Silverberg's 23-year-old boyfriend was among those put on alert Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went down to the base to pick up his clothes and they told him to pack his 
clothes and be on standby," she said. "I don't want him to go. It's scary. You 
never think it's really going to happen."

HUNTINGTON BEACH WOMAN, 81, KILLED IN CRASH; 2 HURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 81-year-old Huntington Beach woman was killed late Saturday night and two 
other people were seriously injured when two cars collided at a local 
intersection, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Goldfein was pronounced dead at UCI Medical Center, a spokesman for the 
Orange County coroner's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldfein was riding in a 1982 Mercedes Benz driven by Martha Baumel, 52, of 
Huntington Beach when it collided with a 1975 Chevy truck driven by David 
Zunig, 20, of Costa Mesa, said Lt. Jim Cutshaw of the Huntington Beach Police 
Department. Baumel and Zunig were hospitalized with major head and internal 
injuries, Cutshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the Mercedes Benz was "going at a high rate of speed" westbound 
on Bolsa Avenue at 11:50 p.m. when it entered the Springdale Street 
intersection and collided with the truck, Cutshaw said. The collision knocked 
both cars into a nearby field, Cutshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zunig was taken to Huntington Beach Medical Center. His condition Sunday was 
not released. 
</P>
<P>
 Baumel's condition also was not released Sunday night at UCI Medical Center.

PEROT CALLS GULF DEPLOYMENT A PLOY; POLITICS: FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE 
ACCUSES CLINTON ADMINISTRATION OF MOVING TROOPS TO BOLSTER NOVEMBER ELECTION 
RESULTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling President Clinton "a draft dodger," a combative and prickly Ross Perot 
on Sunday accused the White House of springing news of ominous Iraqi troop 
movements as a ploy to bolster Democratic popularity as the November elections 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the most cynical thing in the world," the 1992 independent presidential 
candidate said. "It is rotten. It is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the current U.S. intervention in Haiti, Perot, playing the role 
of a fictitious Clinton adviser, said: "The first war didn't get him a bump in 
the polls, now let's try a second one." 
</P>
<P>
 To back up his charges, the Texas businessman asserted that the President and 
his national security team "have known this (the Iraqi troop movements) for 
weeks," assuming, he added, that "the CIA is not dead and buried." 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation," Perot also offered his prescription 
for defusing the mounting tensions along the Iraq-Kuwait border: 
</P>
<P>
 "Just tap him (Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein) on the shoulder quietly and say: 
'Don't do anything tricky -- because we've got unlimited unmanned missiles, 
unmanned drones. We will wipe your country out. We did it once, we'll do it 
again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 If that tactic failed, Perot had a ready alternative: the assassination of 
Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saddam Hussein is the problem. Eliminate the problem, and your problem goes 
away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perot, who is re-emerging in the political arena after an unsuccessful 
personal campaign against the North American Free Trade Agreement, did not 
address the morality of political assassinations. But he left little doubt that 
he believed in the efficacy of such action. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to U.S. bombing raids against Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi during 
the 1980s, Perot noted: "We didn't kill him, but have you heard from him since? 
This guy has repented, been reborn. He's a choirboy in the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
 An April 15, 1986, U.S. bombing raid on Tripoli killed 38 people, including 
Kadafi's 15-month-old adopted daughter, Hana. 
</P>
<P>
 Perot also called the President's top advisers "a lightweight crowd" and made 
unsubstantiated allegations that Haiti's elected president, Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide, is a drug dealer -- and that he has misappropriated millions of 
dollars in U.S. aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Newcombe, director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset 
Control, could not be reached Sunday for a response. A White House spokesman 
refused to comment on Perot's charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from his shrill tone, Perot's remarks stand out because critics of a 
President usually tone down their attacks during a time of heightened tensions. 
But Perot was unapologetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing with Saddam Hussein is a tiny little event. Don't suddenly 
turn this into a worldwide media event just as you come to an election. That's 
what I'm saying," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to pay with our sons' and daughters' lives if he (Clinton) 
stumbles into something else stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 Turning to a reporter on the program, Perot snapped: "You're saying: 'Why are 
you being so harsh?' Some great young person with stars in his eyes, wearing 
the uniforms of the United States, will have his life put at risk by people who 
don't know what they're doing."

DENVER TEACHERS VOTE TO STRIKE; JAIL THREATENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Teachers unhappy with their salaries and undaunted by threats of jail voted 
Sunday night to strike after last-ditch negotiations with the city school 
district failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mayor Wellington Webb urged both sides to resume talks Sunday, none 
were scheduled and the strike was expected to begin this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 State labor director Joe Donlon, who drafted the rejected contract, warned 
Friday that a strike or lockout would be illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Striking teachers could face $100-per-day fines and up to 60 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has hired about 1,500 replacements in case of a strike and says 
all 107 schools will remain open to its 63,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Donlon's $5.1-million, one-year contract proposal gave every teacher a $1,001 
raise instead of the seniority-based pay hike the teachers had sought. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the school board canceled the teachers' scheduled 3.5% raise in an 
attempt to cut its deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 About 65% of the 2,920 teachers who voted rejected the proposed contract. 
About 3,800 were eligible to vote. The last strike, in 1969, lasted 14 days.

MAN ARRESTED AT NICOLE SIMPSON HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Diego County man allegedly broke a window at Nicole Brown Simpson's 
Brentwood condo and attempted to kick an officer during questioning, police 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Street, 31, of Vista was arrested on suspicion of trespassing and assault 
Saturday and taken to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center for psychiatric tests.The 
hospital released him to police custody after he was found to be mentally 
competent, said Los Angeles police spokesman Officer Arthur Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers went to the Bundy Drive condominium at 9:30 p.m. when the property 
manager reported that he had made a citizen's arrest, Holmes said. Police found 
Street drunk and mumbling that he was upset about Nicole Simpson's death and 
that he was her boyfriend, the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Street was being booked, he kicked at an officer, but the officer was 
not hurt, Holmes said. Street was being held Sunday at the West Los Angeles 
police station in lieu of $250 bail, Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson, who has pleaded not guilty, is being tried on charges that he 
murdered his ex-wife Nicole and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman.

MANHUNT ENDS IN ARREST OF SUSPECT IN SANTA ANA SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 16-day manhunt ended Sunday with the arrest of a 38-year-old Santa Ana man 
who was being sought in connection with the shooting death of his ex-wife's 
boyfriend, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Fortunato Vasquez, who had been described as armed and dangerous, was 
spotted by Santa Ana police driving along the 400 block of East 1st Street at 
9:50 a.m. He was arrested after a short chase that ended outside his ex-wife's 
home, said Santa Ana Police Sgt. Ed Andrade. Vasquez was driving the blue van 
that was allegedly used in the slaying, Andrade said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez was wanted for the shooting death of Faustino Sanchez Venegas, 22, of 
Santa Ana, Andrade said. Venegas was gunned down Sept. 23 outside an apartment 
in the 300 block of South Oak Street in the southeast area of the city. The 
shooting occurred at the same apartment complex where Francisca Pereida Soto, 
Vasquez's former common-law wife, lived. 
</P>
<P>
 Venegas was placing tools in the trunk of his car when a man identified by 
police as Vasquez drove up in the van and shot him. After being shot, Venegas 
ran about 30 to 50 feet to the apartment's front door, where he collapsed and 
died, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some sort of relationship" between Venegas and Soto, Andrade said. 
"The preliminary investigation indicated that Vasquez was upset about his 
former common-law wife and her refusal to return to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez has spent time in prison on a narcotics-related charge, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Vasquez initially sped away in his van after being spotted by 
police but was apprehended about 20 minutes later when he stopped at the Oak 
Street apartment complex, Andrade said. He was arrested without incident while 
attempting to get out of the vehicle and is being held at Santa Ana Jail, 
Andrade said.

2 O.C. MEN ARRESTED IN BURGLARY PROBE AFTER CAR CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Santa Ana men were arrested Sunday night in connection with 13 commercial 
burglaries after leading police on an eight-minute chase through the streets of 
Irvine and Santa Ana and ramming a police car on the northbound lanes of the 
Costa Mesa Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent Tapia, 19, a passenger in the fleeing 1985 red Mustang, was arrested 
after he jumped from the moving vehicle in Santa Ana, said Irvine police Sgt. 
Craig Smith.The driver, Keith Patrick O'Brian, 24, was apprehended moments 
later, when the car came to a stop at Santa Fe and 2nd streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The pursuit began in Irvine about 6:50 p.m. near Deere and Red Hill avenues 
when an Irvine patrol officer recognized the Mustang as one that had been used 
in a series of burglaries of Price Clubs and Sam's Clubs in Yorba Linda, 
Fountain Valley and Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 During the pursuit, which involved units from the Santa Ana Police Department 
and a Newport Beach Police Department helicopter, O'Brian allegedly spun the 
Mustang around while traveling north on the Costa Mesa Freeway near the Edinger 
Avenue off-ramp and rammed at least one pursuing vehicle. He then exited the 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither man was armed. They were arrested on suspicion of felony evasion, 
commercial burglary and assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer. 
O'Brian also was suspected of driving under the influence of a narcotic.

By Do you have a question about an on-the-job situation? If so, please mail it 
to Shop Talk, Los Angeles Times, P.O. Box 2008, Costa Mesa, CA 92626. Or call

 Question: I am an exempt manager whose company requires me to take vacation 
time in half-day increments if I need to be away from the office on personal 
business. Additionally, if I run out of sick leave I would be docked in 
partial-day increments if I should get sick during a business day and need to 
leave work. My average workday is 11 hours, or about 55 to 60 hours each week. 
Am I really exempt or should I be compensated for overtime? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Employees in executive, administrative and professional positions are 
generally exempt from the wage and hour laws that establish the right to 
overtime pay. You describe yourself as a "manager," which would generally be 
considered an executive or administrative position. Therefore, you are probably 
in fact an "exempt" employee, and, therefore, not entitled to overtime pay.

 Question: I was recently let go from my job as a manicurist. I was told by the 
salon management that I was an independent contractor, but my hours were 
specifically set by the salon and I was even pressured into donating my 
services to various charitable events sponsored by the salon, which the owner 
would later take as a tax deduction. Do I have any legal recourse? 
</P>
<P>
 -- K.T., Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Perhaps. If you were not truly an independent contractor, but were an 
employee, and your employer failed to pay you for work done, or for overtime 
compensation, you would be able to pursue a claim against that employer for 
unpaid wages with the California Division of Labor Standards of Enforcement.

<P>
 Question: I was terminated from a computer industry job after 16 1/2 years, 
where I had been a senior applications analyst and database consultant. One 
month before my termination, management placed me under a 
"performance-improvement plan," which was a big insult. I was also given the 
demeaning task of "tagging" a customer's PC inventory, which was like being 
asked to "do the windows." Such tasks, or moving a customer's equipment after 
an internal office relocation, were not part of my job description. 
</P>
<P>
 But I performed all tasks required of me during eight of the 22 working days 
during the so-called performance-improvement plan period. The rest of the time 
I was left idle. Then I was fired. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe this was a setup by the company's new management to avoid having to 
pay a considerable amount of severance pay and other layoff benefits under the 
company's written policy and guidelines. I would appreciate your suggestions as 
to courses of action that I may take, and what my legal rights are in this 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- G.U., Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Your situation is somewhat complicated, and you will need to consult 
with an experienced employment lawyer before deciding whether to proceed with a 
lawsuit. While you may have felt insulted by certain work assignments and by 
being placed on the "performance-improvement plan," these matters are 
ordinarily within management's rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, business needs dictate that employees be assigned to perform tasks that 
they may consider beneath their dignity. Also, management sometimes will take a 
different view than an employee of the adequacy of that employee's performance. 
These realities of the business world do not provide the basis for a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, if you have some proof that you were fired in order to 
prevent you from obtaining severance benefits or because new management just 
wanted to "clean house" of long-term employees without regard to their 
performance, you may have a viable claim. The Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act (ERISA) is a federal law that, among other things, prohibits 
employers from firing employees just to prevent them from obtaining benefits, 
such as severance pay. 
</P>
<P>
 You do not mention your age, but if you are over 40 and younger employees with 
work records similar to yours were retained, you may have a claim under the age 
discrimination laws as well. Finally, your longevity, combined with certain 
policies and practices of your employer, may give you a right under the law not 
to be terminated except for good cause if you can prove that the real reason 
you were terminated is because new management wanted to get rid of employees 
from the old regime. In that event, you may have a claim on this basis as well.

 Question: If your employer relocates its operations out of state and the 
company offers you a job in the new location, but you refuse to move, can you 
still collect unemployment in California? 
</P>
<P>
 -- D.T., Corona del Mar 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: California Unemployment Insurance Code Section 1257 provides for 
disqualification for unemployment benefits if an employee refuses suitable 
employment without good cause. Although you do not give your reasons for 
refusing the offered employment, the inconvenience of relocating out of state 
would be good cause for refusing the employment. 
</P>
<P>
 If part of your reason for staying in California is because your spouse is 
employed here, then that would also qualify as good cause. Section 1256 states 
that voluntarily terminating employment to accompany a spouse to another state 
is good cause. The same would hold true if you were refusing to relocate to 
another state in order to stay with a spouse who is working in California. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional question raised is whether the offer of employment in the new 
location qualifies as "suitable employment" under the code. Section 1258 states 
that the distance of the employment from the employee's residence is taken into 
consideration when determining if employment is "suitable." Since your employer 
has moved out of state, it is highly unlikely that you would be able to commute 
to the new job from your current residence, and therefore the employment would 
most likely not be determined to be suitable. 
</P>
<P>
 I recommended you contact your local Employment Development Department if you 
have any additional questions or you want assistance under the Displaced Worker 
Assistance program, which helps workers such as yourself who are out of a job 
because of their employer either going out of business or moving out of state 
as a result of the economy.

 Question: I was hired as a bus driver for a drum and bugle corps in Anaheim. I 
have not received my final paycheck, which was due months ago. I have tried to 
contact this company numerous times, and they will not respond. How can I go 
about getting my final paycheck? 
</P>
<P>
 -- S.E. 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Contact your employer, in writing -- certified letter recommended -- 
requesting your final paycheck, list your estimate of all hours worked and 
unpaid, and include your current mailing address. Unfortunately, without 
knowledge of the facts pertinent to why you left the company, it is unclear why 
the delay has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 There are state regulations that require certain time frames within which 
final wages must be paid. The requirement may vary depending on the cause for 
separation (i.e., quitting versus an involuntary termination), and it also 
depends whether the company is a government or private-sector employer. All of 
these timetable considerations have long since lapsed with your July 20 due 
date for final wages owed. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, if you do not receive an immediate response from the employer, the 
next stop would be to contact the local office of the California State Labor 
Commissioner for further assistance.

 If Jeannette Holguin can persuade her husband, their Montebello home will be 
the first on the block with the latest in home entertainment gadgets: a digital 
satellite system. 
</P>
<P>
 The new system's RCA receiver and 18-inch in diameter satellite dish feed 
about 150 channels of movies, news, sports and frequent pay-per-view features 
through a high-resolution digital signal transmitted by DirecTv -- Hughes 
Aircraft's new satellite broadcasting network. The system costs at least $700, 
not including installation and a monthly programming fee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see the difference in the clarity -- the picture is just great," said 
Holguin, as she watched a satellite-fed movie at the Howard's Television & 
Appliances store in San Gabriel Sunday afternoon. "I like it. I want it." 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's first compact digital satellite system, a $1-billion venture, 
considered a serious threat to the cable TV and video rental businesses, 
attracted the curious as well as buyers during its first weekend on sale in 
Southern California, retailers said.

 Carlson's appliance store in Santa Monica sold out its initial stock of 25 
satellite systems, which was launched last week with a large advertising blitz. 
The first wave of customers included the "elderly . . . because they can stay 
home and watch a lot of TV and young guys who like to play with these new 
things," said salesman Ben Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
 Many salespeople had to educate as well as sell customers on the new system 
that combines hardware and 150 channels of programs ranging from HBO to the 
Weather Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 RCA supplies the hardware -- at least $700 plus about $200 for installation -- 
that consumers need to pick-up the signal. 
</P>
<P>
 DirecTv monthly programming fees run from about $30 to $34 a month. 
Pay-per-view movies cost $2.99 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes Aircraft, in a major effort to diversify away from the defense 
industry, owns the satellite network and DirecTv, which supplies the 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Segundo-based General Motors subsidiary has said it needs to put the 
system, which is already available overseas, into three million U.S. households 
by 1997 to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Many shoppers at Tektronic in Westminster were surprised to discover they had 
to pay a monthly DirecTv programming fee, said store manager Thomas Van Nuygen, 
who said it has taken nearly an hour to explain and pitch the system before 
closing the deal. Still, Tektronic has sold 19 systems so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is going to be a hot seller for the holidays," Nuygen said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Howard's in San Gabriel, assistant store manager Ed Grose said customers 
have been impressed by the clarity of the system's signal and the small size of 
the dish -- about the size of a hubcap. But, "it's the programming -- that's 
what people are buying," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grose, whose six-store chain sold 24 systems over the weekend, said customers 
have told him they will cancel their cable subscriptions once they are hooked 
up to the DirecTv satellite. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a hefty investment, Holguin of Montebello said DirecTv's monthly fees 
are comparable to her current cable bill. But the $2.99 DirecTv charges for a 
pay-per-view movie, which typically start every 30 minutes, is about half of 
what her cable operator charges.  
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to call (the cable operator) for a (pay-per-view) movie," 
Holguin said. "You just push a button on the remote and you got it."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENTERPRISE; SURVIVAL STORY; WARTIME FRIENDS BUILD FIRM INTO 
MAJOR CATERING TRUCK FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Call them catering trucks or meat wagons or lunch trucks or loncherias or 
even, as the health department does, "mobile food preparation units." 
</P>
<P>
 Just don't call them roach coaches , at least not around the headquarters of 
Cater-Craft Foods Inc., one of the largest catering truck companies in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 That common slang term makes the principals of Cater-Craft frown as one. "We 
don't like that name very much," said one tersely. 
</P>
<P>
 Small wonder, because Southern California is the catering truck capital of the 
world. And in this ultra-competitive industry, a sick customer or a flat tire 
suddenly becomes a matter of survival, with hundreds of other operators ready 
to move in and lean on those tune-blaring horns. 
</P>
<P>
 Cater-Craft has been adept at figuring out how to keep its trucks on the road 
and the customers coming back. Survival has also meant outlasting a recession 
that finally appears to be easing, and overcoming the stain on Cater-Craft's 
reputation left by government charges of antitrust violations, predatory 
pricing and intimidation of competitors. Cater-Craft officials still maintain 
their innocence, but say they settled the suit to avoid litigation costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the four men who own Cater-Craft, survival means much more, as 
witnessed by a faded photograph that holds a place of honor over the company's 
fancy new computerized cash register. In it stand four teen-agers, far from 
their Armenian homes, smiling for the camera in a refugee relocation camp for 
those who survived forced labor in Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Petrosian, Erik Pulatian, Nick Minasian and Leo Rawoew have done an 
awful lot of things together since they met in 1945 in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "They brought us from Russia for free labor," said Erik Pulatian, an 
unassuming man who still puts in 12-hour days at Cater-Craft, wearing the same 
uniform as the resident mechanics. "They didn't call it prison. They called it 
'labor camps,' " Pulatian said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four young men found sponsors in the United States willing to help them 
get started in a new country. They scattered to different states and different 
occupations but came together in Los Angeles nearly three decades ago to try to 
make a living selling food out of four little restaurants on wheels. They 
settled within blocks of each other in Montebello. One partner's son married 
another partner's daughter. Their 21-employee work force is thick with 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the four entrepreneurs, all in their mid-60s now, built a company 
that will serve up more than $6 million in sales this year, said General 
Manager Earl Williams, who runs Cater-Craft's day-to-day operations and has 
worked with the men for 25 years. (Minasian is president, Pulatian is vice 
president and the other two partners are semi-retired.) 
</P>
<P>
 But it remains a constant struggle, with nearly 3,000 licensed trucks vying to 
feed a hungry city. Nobody counts the unlicensed trucks, but they are 
considered to be a growing problem. Cater-Craft owns 51 trucks, and another 70 
use the firm's headquarters at the southwest edge of Downtown Los Angeles as a 
base of operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of lunch trucks in the city of Los Angeles. If you miss a 
day, then you have two trucks waiting there the next day trying to get your 
stop," said Williams, who figures there are about 25 industrial catering 
companies in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very competitive. It's not the same" as it was in 1966, when the 
business started, said Al Petrosian, surveying the company's cavernous 
commissary, which resembles a Price Club without the frills. "But we try to run 
our business real clean." 
</P>
<P>
 The episode with the district attorney's office was all a big misunderstanding 
and was settled to avoid the cost of prolonged litigation, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed in 1986 in Superior Court, charged Cater-Craft and another 
firm, A La Carte Catering, with anti-competitive practices that included 
agreeing to divide certain markets between them, selling food at artificially 
low prices to push out competitors and physically threatening -- in one 
instance, beating up -- competing truck drivers who tried to move into the 
territories that the two companies had staked out. The two industrial caterers 
had formed an illegal trust, which the firms' officers had characterized as "a 
very good agreement among friends," the lawsuit stated. 
</P>
<P>
 Without admitting guilt, Cater-Craft settled the lawsuit in 1989 by agreeing 
to an injunction blocking anti-competitive practices and by paying $20,000 in 
civil penalties and investigation costs. A La Carte Catering also settled 
without admitting wrongdoing, agreed to the injunction and paid $40,750 in 
penalties and investigation costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can truthfully say it was a false accusation," Williams said. "The lawyer 
said, 'You can either pay this or pay me $50,000 and I'll fight it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Williams called industrial catering "an extremely hard business to be in" 
because of all the insurance costs, overhead and government regulations 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 A single truck, generally a customized General Motors vehicle, will cost 
$55,000 or $65,000 but can easily run as high as $100,000, Williams said. Fees 
and insurance on the truck total more than $10,500 a year plus 8.25% sales tax, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Health inspectors visit frequently, making sure the trucks are clean and in 
compliance with a myriad of health regulations. Trucks also must abide by 
restrictions in different cities concerning such things as length of stay and 
use of horns. 
</P>
<P>
 As with many small businesses, financing has been a nagging problem for 
Cater-Craft, which is constantly servicing and replacing trucks and other 
equipment. But the company's bank, Wells Fargo, recently developed a product 
called Custom Capital that allows small businesses to turn a line of credit 
into an equipment loan with a single phone call, thereby avoiding lengthy 
delays while loan documents are readied. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this business, when you need a truck, you need it now and you can't wait 
three or four months to get it financed, so that really helped us," Williams 
said, adding that the firm has purchased several trucks using this loan system. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cater-Craft, a typical day starts at 4 a.m. as the trucks begin to pour 
into the huge lot and park around the facility's giant ice-making machine, 
which turns out 38,000 gallons of ice a day. A few are "cold trucks," carrying 
only drinks and prepackaged foods, but most are "hot trucks," which cook hot 
food right on board. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility turns into semi-organized chaos as more than 400 people bustle 
about, getting the trucks ready to head to more than 1,600 locations. 
Cater-Craft's commissary will sell $30,000 to $35,000 worth of food and cash to 
truck drivers in a single morning. 
</P>
<P>
 During the day, supervisors with cellular telephones keep tabs on the trucks, 
making sure they hit their stops and dispatching mechanics as needed. In the 
afternoon, the trucks return and the arduous clean-up process begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't realize how much work goes into those catering trucks," Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cater-Craft rents its trucks to drivers, who are independent contractors. One 
truck can ring up sales of several hundred dollars a day, and it is the driver 
who determines how well a truck does, Williams said. A winning personality 
sells a lot more burritos and soda, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know some that do $2,000 a day and I know some that do $100 a day," 
Williams said. "Everybody sells the same food. The only thing that Cater-Craft 
has to sell is the good personality of the drivers." 
</P>
<P>
 The business becomes a veritable catalogue of the city's eating habits. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day, the trucks run through nearly 5,000 French rolls and more than 7,500 
eggs. Each month, they peddle more than a million cans of soda and 72,000 bags 
of Frito-Lay brand chips. Bacon comes in by the truckloads from Montana. The 
company once sold cases of Armenian bread for sandwiches; now tortillas are the 
most popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Cigarette sales are down sharply. A decade ago, the company would sell 40 or 
50 cases of cigarettes a month. Now they sell two cases a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Catering trucks also are a good gauge of the region's economic health, 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the first to know when business gets bad because people are bringing 
the brown bag," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cater-Craft's revenues hit a high of $8 million annually before the recession, 
then companies began laying off and sales slipped below $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody got burned," said co-owner Nick Minasian. "1993 was the worst 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Petrosian: "We cut even our pay to keep going." 
</P>
<P>
 But, the partners agree, things are getting better. Sales are climbing and 
will top $6 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see a turnaround. It's a damn slow one, but I see an increase," Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the trucks keep coming and going. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just do our job and chug on down the road," Williams said.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: 5 SCENARIOS FOR 1995 -- AND TIPS FOR INVESTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wanted: A winning investment formula for 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The near-term is looking like a stalemate to many Wall Streeters, who figure 
the markets may remain in a mode of backing and filling while waiting for the 
next Federal Reserve Board interest-rate hike, probably in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The more important issue is what happens after that. As some investors look 
ahead to 1995, they are increasingly intrigued both with the possibilities and 
potential pitfalls for stocks, bonds and short-term cash accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 With long-term bond yields already at 28-month highs, what if the Fed actually 
succeeds in engineering a "soft landing" for the economy? Could bond yields 
tumble? 
</P>
<P>
 What if economic growth remains strong in '95 and inflation zooms? Would the 
markets find that a deadly combo? 
</P>
<P>
 And what if, despite all of the current evidence to the contrary, the surprise 
in '95 is that the economy sinks into recession? 
</P>
<P>
 Financial markets would probably play out very differently under each of these 
scenarios. Here's a look at five scripts for the economy in '95, and how 
investors might structure portfolios accordingly: 
</P>
<P>
 * A soft landing. This is the most optimistic bet on Wall Street today. It 
assumes that the Fed raises short-term interest rates two more times at most, 
that real economic growth moderates from the current 4% range to about 2.5% in 
'95, and that bond yields level off or fall back. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives of some of the nation's biggest companies, meeting last week under 
the auspices of the Business Council, indicated their faith in a soft landing 
by projecting 2.6% economic growth in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 They also expect the federal funds rate, a key short-term interest rate, to 
rise from 4.75% now to 5.5% in 1995. But long-term rates should hold steady, 
the council says. 
</P>
<P>
 If they're right, bonds are a great buy today, Wall Streeters say. With 
30-year Treasury bonds yielding just under 8% currently, and many corporate 
bonds yielding nearly 9%, the after-inflation return on long-term bonds is 5% 
to 6% if inflation stays around 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 "There haven't been a lot of times in U.S. history when you've been able to 
earn 5% real returns," says Jack Kallis, manager of the Met Life/State Street 
Government Securities bond fund in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 John Williams, economist at Bankers Trust in New York, is even more 
optimistic: He thinks slower growth and modest inflation will allow 30-year 
T-bond yields to fall to 7.25% in '95, giving bond owners a capital gain on top 
of interest earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 For stocks, meanwhile, a soft landing would probably be the best possible 
scenario. Corporate earnings would continue to advance, while investors would 
no longer face the threat of ever-rising interest rates. The bull market could 
conceivably resume. 
</P>
<P>
 * Strong growth/low inflation. This is what we've enjoyed so far this year, 
and the only real winners have been investors who have dis- invested -- that 
is, people who have stashed cash in money market funds or other short-term 
accounts, reaping the rewards of rising short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 If economic growth stays strong in 1995, it's a sure bet that the Fed will 
continue to push short-term interest rates up sharply. Money market fund 
yields, now around 4.3% on average, could approach 6% by late-1995 if the Fed 
raises rates another 1.5 to 2 points. 
</P>
<P>
 So keeping hefty assets in short-term accounts would be a winning plan in '95, 
if you think the economy isn't going to slow soon. 
</P>
<P>
 But if inflation remains moderate even though growth is strong, must long-term 
interest rates continue rising as well? Some pros don't think so. They see a 
"flat yield curve" on the horizon: That is, short rates go higher, but long 
rates stay level or decline. 
</P>
<P>
 The result would be that short rates could nearly match long rates by late 
'95, or even exceed them. That has been a fairly common toward the end of 
economic booms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there will be an unmistakable tendency for the yield curve to flatten 
and eventually invert" next year, says Anthony Karydakis, economist at First 
Chicago Capital Markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The trick then would be to ride short rates up, then lock in long yields when 
it appears that rates overall have peaked. But such timing is no easy feat, 
naturally. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Steinmetz, manager of the Oppenheimer Strategic Income bond fund in New 
York, argues that investors who expect the Fed to keep pushing up short rates 
in 1995 should be in no hurry to grab long-term bonds. He is dubious that long 
rates can decline while short rates are rising, even if inflation remains tame. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, "long-term bonds cannot rally until the Fed is done tightening," 
Steinmetz says. 
</P>
<P>
 As for U.S. stocks, strong growth and much higher short rates in 1995 might 
mean a repeat of '94. Some stocks would be driven by rising corporate earnings, 
but overall the market would be fighting a vicious head wind. Note, however, 
that many foreign markets might not face the same rate pressures, and could 
thrive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Strong growth/higher inflation. It's probably fair to say that most 
investors don't believe inflation can surge dramatically in the '90s, because 
so much is working against higher prices: mainly, the forces of global 
competition and gains in productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 But what if those forces are overestimated? And how much is too much 
inflation, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 Many economists expect only a moderate increase in inflation in 1995. The 
Business Council concurs, estimating that consumer prices will rise 3.3% next 
year, as opposed to 2.7% this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is whether investors have become so paranoid about inflation that 
even a 3.3% rate -- or at least, the first signs of that kind of rate -- might 
cause much more dislocation in markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Ivanovitch, economist at MSI Global in New York, sees "12 months of 
strong growth and accelerating inflation" ahead, and continuing bear markets in 
stocks and bonds as well. 
</P>
<P>
 At Prudential Securities, economist Richard Rippe also worries about the 
propensity for inflation to surprise. He now projects that U.S. consumer prices 
will be rising at a 3.5% to 4% annual rate by late-1995 as the global economy 
expands, commodity prices climb and labor markets tighten. 
</P>
<P>
 "The risks in the inflation outlook (are) more on the the upside than the 
downside," Rippe warns, especially if labor costs begin to rise as companies 
compete more aggressively to attract workers.  
</P>
<P>
 If you expect inflation shocks in 1995, you would probably want to steer clear 
of bonds now, even though the inflation "premium" in yields is arguably already 
high. Likewise, though some companies would undoubtedly benefit from higher 
prices -- commodity producers, for example -- stock-picking would also be a 
difficult game. 
</P>
<P>
 The only clear winners with strong growth and higher inflation would be "cash" 
investments like money funds, and perhaps gold and real estate. But foreign 
stock markets might also do well, especially in the case of commodity-producing 
smaller countries. 
</P>
<P>
 * Slow growth/higher inflation. Remember "stagflation"? That was the term used 
to describe the U.S. economy of the late-1970s, when growth was slow but 
inflation was high and rising. 
</P>
<P>
 Few Wall Streeters expect a repeat of stagflation in the '90s. The late-'70s 
case was primarily a result of the oil-price shock of that period, as oil 
exporters demanded higher prices, slowing many nations' growth even as they 
paid more for energy. 
</P>
<P>
 But some market bears say stagflation is a real possibility for the United 
States in 1995 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles LaLoggia, who writes the Special Situation Report market newsletter in 
Rochester, N.Y., argues that inflation is mostly a function of how much money 
the Fed has pumped into the economy in prior years. He believes that the Fed 
kept interest rates too low for too long in 1992 and 1993, setting the stage 
for higher prices as excess dollars now make their way into "real" things like 
cars, machine tools, real estate, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, LaLoggia says, even though the Fed will probably succeed in slowing the 
economy with higher interest rates next year, inflation will not be easily 
squashed. That will induce the Fed to go overboard, pushing short rates from 
4.75% now to at least 7.5% by late-1995, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Result: Long-term bond yields will shoot to at least 9%, LaLoggia says, and 
U.S. stocks will crash. "Cash" and gold will be king. 
</P>
<P>
 * Recession. You'd be hard-pressed to find a Wall Street pro who believes 
there's much chance of outright recession beginning before late-1995, and most 
economists doubt we'll have to worry about the R-word before mid-1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, recessions are brought on when the Fed raises interest rates so 
high that economic growth halts. So far, the Fed's five increases in short-term 
rates, from 3% to 4.75%, haven't appeared to slow business activity except in 
the housing arena. 
</P>
<P>
 But what if the U.S. economy suddenly cracks early in 1995, and recession 
begins to look imminent? 
</P>
<P>
 By then, the stock market would most likely be well into a bear phase, as 
investors would be expecting a slump in corporate earnings ahead. So if you 
fear recession by mid-1995, you wouldn't want to be a buyer of U.S. stocks now. 
</P>
<P>
 One usual side effect of recession, of course, is that interest rates begin to 
decline again. So short-term cash accounts would quickly lose their luster, if 
recession looms. And the hot investment, once again, would be bonds, as 
investors would rush to lock in yields. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think there's going to be a recession soon," says Bankers Trust's 
Williams, "you should be buying bonds like crazy."

 Regional Business Outlook Conference: A panel discussion about incentives to 
create and retain business and the effect of government regulation on the 
business community will be featured at the 46th annual Los Angeles Area Chamber 
of Commerce business outlook conference, which will be held Tuesday at the 
Biltmore Hotel in Downtown Los Angeles. Southern California has become a 
favored hunting ground for out-of-towners looking to lure away companies 
unhappy with the area's business climate, although statistics indicate that the 
exodus slowed this year. Conference speakers will include state Assembly 
Speaker Willie L. Brown, RLA Chief Executive Linda Griego, AirTouch 
Communications Chief Executive Sam Ginn and businessman and former Dallas 
Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach.

 Earthquake Insurance Plan: The California Insurance Department will hold 
public hearings at its Downtown Los Angeles offices Wednesday and Thursday on 
Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi's proposal to use the California Fair 
Plan -- the industry-supported pool for high-risk property insurance -- as a 
mechanism to offer stand-alone earthquake policies. Nearly all of the major 
U.S. insurance companies, which face total losses of more than $10 billion from 
the Northridge quake, have stopped offering homeowners and earthquake insurance 
in California.Garamendi and other officials believe the solution to the problem 
is to create a national disaster insurance fund to cope with catastrophes 
ranging from floods to hurricanes to forest fires to earthquakes. But until 
such a program can be enacted, Garamendi proposes ordering the Fair Plan to 
offer "monoline" earthquake policies to all Californians.

 Export Outreach Center: The Export Small Business Development Center will open 
an outreach center in El Monte on Thursday to help San Gabriel Valley 
businesses interested in foreign trade become better at building export 
markets. The Export SBDC was formed three years ago to help small businesses 
throughout Southern California increase exports.The program is a partnership 
involving the Small Business Administration, the California Trade and Commerce 
Agency and the Export Managers Assn. of California. The El Monte outreach 
center is designed to provide assistance in expanding export markets by 
offering consulting services to businesses and access to trade and export 
information. The center also plans to hold regular seminars and workshops on 
trade and export issues. Export SBDC officials said El Monte was chosen for an 
outreach center because of the strong manufacturing base in the San Gabriel 
Valley. Forty percent of the businesses in the valley are involved in 
manufacturing. The outreach center will open at 10501 Valley Blvd. Export SBDC 
officials say the program, which also has offices in Los Angeles, Long Beach 
and Oxnard, helped clients export $115 million in products last year. The 
increase helped create 2,000 jobs for the local economy, they say. An open 
house, hosted by the El Monte/South El Monte Chamber of Commerce, will be held 
at the center from 2 to 7 p.m.

 EPA Reaches Settlement With Kodak: The Environmental Protection Agency 
announced that Eastman Kodak will pay an $8-million penalty and sink millions 
more into environmental efforts at the largest manufacturing facility in the 
Northeast.EPA officials at a news conference in Manhattan touted the agreement 
as a model settlement representing how the agency would like to work on 
remedies with those firms that have damaged the environment. Eastman Kodak's 
sprawling 2,200-acre Rochester, N.Y., complex, which makes photographic 
products, food supplements and other products, employs more than 20,000 people 
in 400 buildings. During its 104 years at the site, the company failed to keep 
tight controls on the discharge of hazardous wastes, the EPA said.

 IBM Sells Out of New PC Line: The shortfall in Aptiva personal computers could 
cost the computer maker more than $100 million in lost revenue in the fourth 
quarter, analysts said. The sellout comes just months after International 
Business Machines Corp. posted huge losses because of a buildup of PCs in 
inventory for the fourth quarter of 1993.IBM said it estimated demand more 
conservatively in order to avoid a repeat of last year's fiasco, when angry 
retailers returned more than $600 million of unsold products, analysts said. In 
the race for market share, IBM has been tripped up by rival Compaq Computer 
Corp., which nabbed first place this year with 13.4% of the market, knocking 
IBM from first to fourth place at only 7.9% of the market.

DAVID VS. GOLIATH IN RACE FOR A NEW SOFTWARE STANDARD; PROGRAMMING: PLANS FOR 
NON-TRADITIONAL COMPUTER DEVICES PIT MICROWARE AGAINST MICROSOFT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<P>
 Eight years ago, Kenneth Kaplan got an offer to sell his software company, 
Microware Systems Corp., to Microsoft Corp., which was already well on its way 
to dominating the personal computer software industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty tempting," said Kaplan, the firm's president and a co-founder. 
</P>
<P>
 But one late night a short time later, a Microware executive "slammed his hand 
on the table and said, 'I don't want to work for the blankety-blanks. I want to 
destroy the blankety-blanks,' " Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's been our policy ever since." 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft is still trying to break into Microware's business, making programs 
that run computerized functions of things that are not typically thought of as 
a computer -- like a TV, pay phone, traffic light or a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Their growing rivalry, despite its David vs. Goliath nature, is a sign of how 
computing is changing. 
</P>
<P>
 In time, many products will have chips and software running inside them, and 
most people won't notice or think of them as computers. Microware hopes to be a 
standard-setter in program design for those devices. 
</P>
<P>
 The company gained attention last winter when one of its programs, called 
David, was chosen as the software for set-top devices in the interactive TV 
services Bell Atlantic Corp. will start this winter in northern Virginia, New 
Jersey and Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 Such set-top boxes are the key appliances that let TVs receive the advanced 
home shopping or video-on-demand services that phone and cable companies 
envision. 
</P>
<P>
 Microware has also formed a similar agreement with Nynex. Kaplan said he hopes 
to announce arrangements with at least two more regional Bell phone companies 
by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company suffered its first loss last month when Southwestern Bell Corp. 
chose Microsoft and Lockheed Corp. as its partners for a two-way TV trial in 
suburban Dallas late next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not terribly concerned about the Southwestern Bell trial," Kaplan said. 
"We have so much momentum now. Microsoft doesn't have a product and won't for 
at least a year." 
</P>
<P>
 The two companies have different approaches to the slowly evolving interactive 
TV market. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft is developing a full-network program for use in both the switching 
centers and the homes and businesses at the end of a network. Microware's 
software is more flexible, with the set-top box being one of many uses for it. 
</P>
<P>
 One sign of Microware's lead is that David has been licensed by 22 consumer 
equipment manufacturers, including IBM, Philips Consumer Electronics, GoldStar 
and Samsung. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is a version of Microware's core OS-9 operating system, developed 
in the early 1980s as a speedy way for a computer chip to manage simultaneous 
tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 750 companies have put OS-9 in more than 4,000 products, ranging 
from the CERN particle accelerator (an atom smasher) to pay phones in France to 
the navigation system in German-made BMWs. 
</P>
<P>
 Such industrial applications account for about 70% of Microware's 
approximately $20 million in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Microware has been successful because of the flexibility of its programs to 
fit with many systems, said Lucie Fjeldstad, a former IBM senior executive and 
now a multimedia consultant in New Canaan, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem putting together this jigsaw puzzle together is that nobody has a 
pattern," Fjeldstad said. "Because no one knows what technology will become the 
standard, it is important that each of the pieces be able to plug into the 
other pieces." 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft was attracted to Microware after OS-9 was chosen in 1986 by Philips 
as the base software in the CD-Interactive player, a machine that plays movies, 
music and games off compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the 1,300-pound gorilla of the business, and anybody that's got an 
interest in anything to do with computers has got to look over their shoulder 
at those guys, no matter what it is," Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Southwestern Bell venture, Microsoft is in a partnership 
with Intel Corp. and General Instrument Corp. to make a set-top box. Tests are 
planned in 1995, said Naren Naph, manager of interactive programs for 
Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we sat this one out for the next two to three years we would feel we had 
missed," Naph said. "This is a marathon we are digging in for many, many 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither company expects to see much revenue from two-way TV for some time.

SENATE PASSES 1995 BUDGET FOR CASH-STARVED SEC; LEGISLATION: CHAIRMAN BLASTS 
LAWMAKERS FOR ALLOWING REPUBLICANS TO DELAY APPROVAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As one of its final acts of the year, the Senate passed a new budget for a 
money-short Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 On a voice vote Saturday, the Senate approved the fiscal 1995 package of $125 
million for the SEC, which had to trim fees, curtail operations and prepare for 
possible reduced workweeks. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. called his first news conference Friday to 
blast the Senate for permitting a few Republicans to postpone action. "I am 
deeply distressed," Levitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's fiscal 1994 budget expired Sept. 30. Struggling to make financial 
ends meet, Levitt halted routine examinations and confined SEC activities to 
court-ordered appearances and cases of suspected fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay also forced the agency to cut nearly in half registration fees for 
new stock and debt offerings, giving corporate America a bonanza and pinning a 
big loss on taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Authority to charge higher fees expired last Friday, the end of fiscal 1994, 
and could not be resumed until the SEC got a new budget. The fees that the 
agency charges to register securities dropped to 1/50 of 1% of the amount to be 
sold from 1/29 of 1% at the beginning of the government's fiscal year on Oct. 
1. The reduced fee represented a loss of about $144,000 for each $1 billion of 
securities registered. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday and Friday alone, companies ranging from J.P. Morgan & Co. Inc. to 
American Express Co. to Citicorp's credit card unit filed registration 
statements for more than $65 billion in so-called "shelf filings," which allow 
companies to register securities that can be brought to market any time in the 
following two years. 
</P>
<P>
 As of the close of business Thursday, the Treasury had lost $10 million of 
registration fees it could have collected at the higher level. "People 
understand what is going on and they are getting in while the going is good," 
Levitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC funding measure had been trapped in the Senate because it was the last 
spending bill left this year. As such, it was the last one to which senators 
could attach pet spending amendments. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, the SEC budget was held up by Republican senators, 
including Orrin Hatch of Utah and William Roth of Delaware, who wanted to 
attach a provision that would allow millions of self-employed people to deduct 
a portion of their health insurance premiums from their taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatch lifted his hold Thursday, and other Republicans lifted their holds 
Saturday. They did so only after the House adjourned last night, meaning they 
couldn't get the needed approval from that chamber for any change in the SEC 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Senate had failed to approve the spending package, the SEC was prepared 
to trim its work force by going on a reduced work week. Levitt said his agency 
was ready to send out notices Tuesday, saying that furloughs would occur in 30 
days. If that happened, he said, about 70% of SEC employees would have been 
limited to two-day workweeks.

 10,000 Ameritech Employees Opt Out: The communications company announced the 
number of employees who accepted incentives to retire early -- 4,000 more than 
it forecast in March when it announced the plan.Ameritech Corp., the 
Chicago-based parent of five Midwestern Bells, said it will take a one-time 
charge of $168 million, or 3 cents a share, in its third quarter to cover the 
additional job cuts. A year ago, the company earned $425 million, or $1.56 per 
share. The company said service will not be affected. A spokesman said the 
cutbacks will allow a leaner Ameritech to better compete as it loses its 
monopoly on local phone service.

HOT JOBS: AS CAREER, PAINTING HAS COVERED IT NICELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE L. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cliff Hampton, 42, has been around painting and paperhanging for most of his 
life. In fact, Wilson & Hampton, the company for which he has worked off and on 
since high school, was founded by his great-uncle in 1923. 
</P>
<P>
 Hampton started in the business by spending summers and weekends helping on 
various projects. "Painting can be very messy, dirty work, but I liked helping 
the paperhangers," he said. "I used to help one of our workers by pasting up 
the paper he was getting ready to hang. I could barely keep up with him he 
worked so fast. People would stop just to watch him work. He was like a 
machine." 
</P>
<P>
 Hampton's firm specializes in architectural and industrial painting. 
Architectural work involves the interior and exterior painting of offices, 
hospitals and other commercial buildings, while industrial painting involves 
factories, equipment, tanks and towers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Few people have enough skill to do both types of work well. Industrial jobs 
often require the removal of hazardous materials such as lead-based paints or 
corroded surfaces with abrasive blasting materials," Hampton said. "This is 
very dirty work, and you have to be careful with the hazardous materials. 
Industrial surfaces are also inspected very carefully to make sure they measure 
up to standards. There's no cutting corners." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Hampton, those capable of working in both capacities are rarely 
unemployed. "We have a few of them on staff, and they are busy all the time. In 
fact, anyone who is bright and aggressive can move up in this field," he said. 
"It's also a good line of work to enter if you want to someday own your own 
business." OCCUPATION: Painter, paperhanger 
</P>
<P>
 * What's involved: Hanging wall coverings and painting homes, offices, 
businesses and industrial sites. 
</P>
<P>
 * Qualifications: Most learn the trade through union-sponsored apprenticeships 
involving on-the-job training and classroom instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: By 1998, the number of painters and paperhangers in Orange County 
is expected to increase 8.5%, to 3,320. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary range: Union pay scales for apprentices range from $7 to $10 an hour. 
Journeymen workers make $19 to $22 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pros: Steady employment for those with a wide range of skills. Many enjoy 
the variety of job sites and work environments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cons: Some painting projects involve working with hazardous materials. The 
work may also involve heights, working atop scaffolding or in confined spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advancement: Experienced painters and paper hangers often become project 
managers who coordinate teams of workers and keep clients informed of the 
project's progress. Many open their own firms. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: "We try to be inventive and imaginative in coming up with new paint 
processes and methods of doing things. That involves drawing on everyone's 
expertise to get the job done."

 Foreign Stock Ownership to Be Raised to 12%: The South Korean government said 
it will expand to 12% on Dec. 1 its current 10% ceiling on foreign stock 
investment in a single Korean company.The limit will be increased to 15% some 
time next year, the Ministry of Finance said. At the end of August, foreign 
investors owned an average 8.6% of total outstanding shares in each Korean 
company. Officials said the ceiling increase is expected to attract about $1 
billion in foreign funds during December. They added that an additional $2.5 
billion to $3 billion in foreign funds will be injected into the stock market 
after the limit rises to 15%.

 U.S. Ranks 12th Among Foreign Investors: American companies have steadily 
boosted investments in Vietnam after the U.S. embargo was lifted in February, 
moving the United States up to 12th place among the country's 50 foreign 
investors, according to the state-run Vietnam News Agency. There are now 20 
U.S. investment projects operational in Vietnam with a total capital of nearly 
$189 million, VNA said. Taiwan is Vietnam's top investor with 144 projects 
worth $1.8 billion, followed by Hong Kong with 157 projects worth $1.4 billion 
and South Korea with 78 projects worth $754 million.

 New Rules Spelled Out for Securities Listing: China's official securities 
watchdog, the Securities Regulatory Commission, has laid out new rules on 
rights issues for listed companies on the country's two exchanges, the 
state-run China Securities newspaper reported.The paper said all rights issues 
must be approved by the commission and central, provincial and municipal 
authorities. The offerings must be in line with the state's industrial policy, 
it said. Companies must wait at least one year between each rights issue. The 
regulations state that most companies must earn a profit rate of an average of 
at least 10% after tax for three years before they will be permitted to offer 
rights issues.

PHILIPPINES ATTEMPTING TO LURE AMERICANS BACK; CAPITAL: SINCE THE OUSTER OF THE 
U.S. MILITARY, OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN PUSHING TO ATTRACT INVESTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some American capital is flowing at Subic Bay, the former giant U.S. naval 
base that is now a special economic zone. And Clark Field, the former U.S. air 
base, has received special designation to attract investment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two years, since the United States was ousted from its vast 
military facilities in the Philippines, the government there has waged a steady 
campaign to get the Americans back -- armed not with military hardware, but 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Filipino officials, armed with revamped investment laws and special economic 
zones, have toured the United States tirelessly in search of investors. The 
nation needs the United States to help build highways, improve 
telecommunications and other infrastructure projects, said Alan Ortiz, the 
undersecretary of the Coordinating Council of the Philippine Assistance 
Program, during a recent investment seminar in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. has key strengths in certain technologies that we need in order to 
build these infrastructure programs," said Ortiz, a key figure in the 
investment recruiting effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's economy is gaining strength, he said, but needs infrastructure 
improvements to ensure continued expansion. Among the opportunities for 
American investors, he said, are projects within Manila, designed to help 
transform the city into one of Asia's major financial centers, Ortiz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Projects currently in the bidding stage include the development of highways, 
railways and waterways serving Manila and the surrounding cities. The 
government is also trying to find investors for power generating plants, 
telecommunications systems and port improvement projects. Another major effort 
involves improving the drinking water supply for the cities of Manila and 
Cavite, including digging wells and building water treatment plants. 
</P>
<P>
 As incentives to foreign investors, Ortiz explained, the government will 
guarantee investors at least a 12% to 20% return, in addition to the normal 
profits earned. President Fidel V. Ramos signed a law in May allowing other 
incentives, including a three- to six-year tax holiday, and tax deductions for 
labor expenses. The government will also allow foreign investors in certain 
infrastructure projects to hire foreign nationals for five years to work in 
supervisory, technical and advisory positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law allows us to be flexible in packaging infrastructure projects," Ortiz 
said. "We have liberalized the rules and regulations that guide the way we 
manage these projects in terms of risks." 
</P>
<P>
 What businesses do need to be aware of are provisions of the law that restrict 
foreign ownership of public utilities systems, limits on lending by 
government-owned banks and requirements for bidders to demonstrate experience 
on similar projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz said businesses interested in the infrastructure programs would go 
through relatively smooth procedures to start up, thanks in part to the new 
investment law. His coordinating council, which oversees development projects, 
will also help smooth the way for investors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing Ortiz and other Filipino officials make their case for foreign 
investment, Tom Burr, an export finance specialist at Union Bank, said the 
session was helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 Burr said the seminar had the right people on hand to answer the majority of 
the questions posed, which helped provide a good insight into the present 
Philippine economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a plus for the Philippines to do it," Burr said. "Giving us the latest 
information helped ease a lot of concerns. It didn't mitigate all the risks 
that are there but having all the new data helps our understanding of the 
business climate there." 
</P>
<P>
 Burr said he was one of many who came to hear the delegation from the 
Philippines who were skeptical about doing business there, based on the 
anti-American sentiments expressed in the 1991 Filipino vote to oust the U.S. 
military from bases and the recent Filipino political instability. Ortiz helped 
ease some concerns, Burr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz said the Philippines is more stable and that the "economy is well on its 
way to achieving a higher growth. . . . That is the key because in the past, 
we've been subject to what's been called boom and bust cycles. Now we think 
we've managed to clear that cycle." 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation is also planning presentations in Houston, Chicago, New York, 
Seattle and Washington, D.C., Ortiz said. He said he plans to be prompt in 
getting back with interested companies to match their proposals with projects 
on the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to follow up quickly with these inquiries and if feasible, we want to 
start negotiating," Ortiz said.

 Stock Market Plunges 6%: Taiwan stocks tumbled today on concerns about the 
health of China's senior leader, Deng Xiaoping, analysts said.The benchmark 
weighted price index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 405.88 points, or 6.13%, 
to 6214.48, on trading worth $2.2 billion. Declining issues outnumbered 
gainers, 321 to 8, with 166 companies closing down their daily trading limit of 
7%. A wire service reported today that a Chinese naval official had died last 
month, and investors may have mistakenly believed the person was Deng, said 
David Yu, vice president of National Investment Trust Co.

 Auto Parts Distribution to Be Studied: The Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry will undertake a study on how auto parts are distributed in Japan in 
order to further expand imports, the Nihon Keizai newspaper said. The ministry 
will try to find out what hampers sales of foreign-made auto parts in Japan.The 
project will begin next fiscal year, the paper said. In recent trade talks, 
U.S. and Japanese negotiators failed to reach an agreement in auto parts, which 
account for 60% of Japan's trade surplus with the United States. Meanwhile, 
Ford Motor Co. said Toyota dealers in Japan will begin selling imported Ford 
cars for the first time, as the auto maker expands its sales network to about 
300 Japanese outlets.

ATLAS FINDS ITS NICHE IN AIR CARGO MARKET WITH JUST-IN-TIME DELIVERY; 
TRANSPORTATION: COMPANY BRINGS IN THE GOODS RIGHT BEFORE THEY'RE NEEDED. 
</P>

<P>
 Huge Boeing 747 cargo jets serving as flying warehouses are playing a key role 
for a clothing manufacturer aptly named Just in Time -- speeding the latest 
fashions from Asian factories to U.S. retailers to sell the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-range jets operated by Atlas Air Inc. typically start loading at 6 
a.m. Sunday in Hong Kong. Dresses, suits and other dry goods on hangers arrive 
at the planes in 10-foot high cardboard boxes. Each already has the name of the 
store, bar codes and price tags. 
</P>
<P>
 With a refueling stop at a former Soviet military base, the big jets reach New 
York in time for the clothes to be on the floor at Bloomingdale's on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlas has found its niche in the air cargo market with "just-in-time" 
delivery, the system used by auto makers and other companies who want goods 
right before they're needed, rather than weeks or months in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael A. Chowdry, chairman and chief executive of Atlas, says his fleet of 
six 747s means "no warehousing, no theft, no insurance claims," for 
manufacturers and retailers to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are flying warehouses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For retailers faced with short life spans for some of their merchandise -- 
such as the latest, most trendy clothes -- just-in-time delivery via companies 
like Atlas means the stores are certain to get the goods they need to meet 
customer demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The store knows what the best-sellers are. Maybe a blue tie is selling better 
than a red one. They can send the information direct to the factory and 
increase orders for the most popular fashions," Chowdry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clothing from Asia isn't the only cargo Chowdry's 747-200s haul. They fly to 
and from Taipei, Bangkok, Dubai, Luxembourg, Amsterdam, New Delhi, Singapore 
and Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
 Shipment of auto parts from the Far East to Europe and the United States has 
also helped the cargo business. And "TVs, VCRs and computers are all subject to 
rapid changes," Chowdry said. "They, too, are time-sensitive or 
fashion-oriented and in need of air shipment." 
</P>
<P>
 Outbound cargo from the U.S. includes fresh seafood, machine tools, beef, 
circuit boards, helicopters, aircraft engines and wings and even race cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Chowdry says he has an edge over most competitors who tend to use the 747-100. 
The 200 model, he points out, carries 30,000 pounds more cargo and has longer 
range. Atlas' jets can take off with 117 tons of cargo. 
</P>
<P>
 The planes are busy. By having the freight ready to load through the 10-foot 
2-inch front cargo door, in most cases the 747s do a 55-minute turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 Chowdry has the top deck of the 747 outfitted with three bunk beds and four 
seats to take care of a relief crew on long flights. He hires only pilots with 
thousands of hours in the 747. Atlas planes average 14.6 hours a day in the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a plane that gulps 4,000 gallons of fuel an hour, it is important to 
have proficient pilots who know jet streams and other means of maximizing fuel 
economy," Chowdry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, some of the cargo moves very slowly before reaching the big jets. 
"We are taking containers that arrive in Hong Kong on barges from throughout 
Asia and others that are barged from the Indian subcontinent to Dubai," Chowdry 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Chowdry, who lives in Colorado although most of his company's U.S. operations 
are in New York, was born in Lahore in what is now Pakistan. He was taken to 
England while a youth and later came to the United States and attended the 
University of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 He was hired as a consultant to help reorganize now-defunct Frontier Airlines. 
In 1985, he started Aeronautics Leasing Inc., which he operates today as an 
affiliate of Atlas Air. He leases aircraft to airlines around the world, 
including Air France, American, British, China, Continental and Northwest 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlas was started in 1992. Chowdry predicts the company will have $150 million 
in revenue this year. 
</P>
<P>
 He plans to expand his company to include 10 of the 747-200s by next year.

Q & A: FRONT ROW SEAT ON JAPAN-U.S. TRADE; COMMERCE: RYOZO YANAGIUSHI, WHO RUNS 
CYPRESS COMPLEX OF ELECTRONICS GIANT MATSUSHITA, HAS WATCHED THE ACTION FOR 35 
YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When trade disputes rage, the distant thunder can be heard in the quiet 
industrial parks of Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, behind manicured lawns on gently rolling slopes, are titans of Japanese 
industry like the Western headquarters of Matsushita Electric Corp. of America. 
It is a name that would mean nothing to the average person until you roll off 
the brands it represents -- Panasonic, Quasar and Technics. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsushita sold $6.5 billion worth of electronics, from laptop computers to 
camcorders, in North America in its most recent fiscal year. So when the United 
States and Japan talk trade, Matsushita has more than a passing interest. 
</P>
<P>
 So, too, does Ryozo (Ricky) Yanagiushi, the vice president who oversees the 
company's sprawling 25-acre complex in Cypress. An unassuming, gracious 
58-year-old, Yanagiushi is also chairman of the Orange County chapter of the 
Japan Business Assn. of Southern California, a trade promotion group. 
</P>
<P>
 He watched as the United States and Japan announced a breakthrough trade 
agreement a week ago that could make it easier for American manufacturers to 
sell medical and telecommunications equipment to the Japanese government, and 
for makers of flat glass to enter a market that has been virtually closed to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 But the agreements stopped short of American negotiators' largest goal: a 
bigger piece of the automotive parts business, which accounts for two-thirds of 
the nation's $60-billion annual trade deficit with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 For Yanagiushi, these events are only the latest chapter in a struggle he has 
seen unfold over a 35-year career at Matsushita from both sides of the Pacific. 
In an interview late last week, Yanagiushi shared his thoughts on the latest 
trade talks and U.S.-Japanese relations in general: 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What do you think the trade agreements will ultimately mean? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: My general feeling is that this event, as reported, is a very happy 
ending to the series of negotiations. Those key issues have come to an 
agreement, except for auto parts. Those three areas (agreed upon) will set a 
basis for future agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are Americans closing the quality gap? 
</P>
<P>
 A: In electronic parts imported to Japan, this quality gap became the key 
issue in the last 10 years. We were enthusiastic about importing from the 
States. We did really extensive study and negotiations with U.S. vendors. There 
had been a rather large gap in quality, which was not accepted in Japan. It's a 
fascinating game you have to go through. And one by one, it can be changed on 
both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How can it be changed? 
</P>
<P>
 A: (Japanese) quality-minded manufacturing systems want (American parts) as 
equal in quality to their own domestic parts as possible. The robotization, or 
automatic manufacturing system (in Japan), is very precise. U.S. suppliers had 
to adjust themselves to feed into those systems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are Japanese customers ready to buy American goods? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think that, especially last year, American automobiles have been gaining 
popularity. The total number of cars sold is small, but the rate of growth is 
high. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What kind of Japanese customer would want to buy an American car, the ones 
who want to stand out? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Those who want to stand out is one segment. That has been there for many 
years, but that did not support the numbers of cars being sold from the States 
now. These days it's because American cars are reasonably priced. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is the quality of the cars better? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Consumers in Japan feel that American cars are up again in quality. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why wouldn't the Japanese government, then, not want American auto parts 
sold in Japan? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I can appreciate the government's attitude of not being able to force the 
private sector to buy them. Japan's system is not that way. They have a certain 
limit of guiding the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: And that's good? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. The trend shows that American components coming into Japan have more 
room for growth because Japanese auto manufacturers are eager to expand the 
import portion of their components. Therefore, I think U.S. suppliers who are 
there and successful are not complaining. But since there are varieties of auto 
parts manufacturers in the States who want to sell in Japan, they want to see 
easier access. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think the progress being made in trade talks is a result of the 
Japanese government's fear of sanctions? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Of course. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is that good, that the United States should be acting through threat rather 
than mutual cooperation? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I, of course, would like to see more dialogue in front-line talks that can 
be the basis for any negotiations. The talk will reflect the political 
situation of both countries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is the Japanese government protectionist? 
</P>
<P>
 A: They are not protectionist at all. . . . Newcomers have to learn (how to 
break into Japanese business). For the government to satisfy foreign suppliers, 
they have to lower the bar for everybody . . . and that takes time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Given how low prices are for the same products here as they are in Japan, 
particularly rice, isn't that proof that Japan has kept the barriers too high? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well that hasn't been set artificially. When we look around and see the 
(price) difference, particularly with the States, we came to know that it is 
quite a big difference. There is an effort to make it narrower. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How about the United States? In your experience as an importer here, have 
you encountered trade barriers? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Punitive tariffs are imposed on color TVs. That has really worked for the 
United States. There are no complete color TVs coming in today from the 
outside. Manufacturers like us are manufacturing here. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: It's been said that the United States was shortsighted in adopting such a 
policy because it virtually guarantees that foreign manufacturers will set up 
plants here and forever be shipping the profits back to their home countries. 
Your assessment? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think it's a good thing that the plants were built here. Perhaps it's not 
as good for our colleagues in Japan, because there are fewer jobs. But we are a 
multinational operation and we consider it positively. We want to be a real 
corporate citizen. . . . For us, it is good if the trade agreements encourage 
global activities so that good things produced in certain places can be 
supportive of other areas. Today, we are exporting American-made color TVs to 
Japan -- built in Illinois -- and microwave ovens to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: As more Japanese plants open overseas, won't it eventually mean more 
unemployment in Japan? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We will be able to keep new things. We will be able to take care of 
ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How are relations overall between the United States and Japan? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We feel a lot easier than last week (laughs). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are the Japanese people thinking better of the United States these days? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think so. The Japanese people are more cost-oriented. The economic 
recession has hit everyone, and they are looking for something better. They are 
price conscious and value conscious. When the economy peaked, people thought 
they could reach for anything. They wanted luxury. Not today. Today, they want 
reasonable price, which is a good thing. The same thing has taken place in the 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are American workers still viewed as lazy? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think those kinds of extreme views are diminishing, and they are not 
popular at all.

 Stashed among the gear of one Marine boarding a troop transport plane headed

the last time U.S. forces faced Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein -- a faded American 
flag. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's worn and tattered but still in good shape," said Master Sgt. William 
Lee, a lean 20-year veteran who had the flag with him during the seven months 
he spent in Saudi Arabia during Desert Storm and Desert Shield. "I just can't 
wait to bring it home again." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, who is based at Camp Pendleton in northern San Diego County, and 299 
other Marines who will get tanks and trucks and other equipment ready for 
arriving troops had been mustered to this desert air base beginning at 1:30 
a.m. from Pendleton and the Twentynine Palms Marine Corps Air Ground Combat 
Center in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
 They and 65 Navy personnel were about to fly in three C-141 Starlifters to a 
naval base on the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, where they will 
board ships headed for the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder of the 18,000 Marines from Pendleton will be called for duty, 
the Pentagon said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing camouflage battle fatigues and carrying gas masks and M-16 rifles, all 
spoke of sudden goodbys, of wives and children who have learned in recent years 
that the Marines are the nation's "911 squad," as one put it, ready to fly off 
in a matter of hours into a distant hot spot. 
</P>
<P>
 At least half had seen action during the Persian Gulf War nearly four years 
ago, and some seemed eager to go back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we can go over . . . and do what we should have done the first time," 
said a 25-year-old corporal based at Twentynine Palms, referring to the fact 
that Hussein remains in power. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine Sgt. Keith Luzbetak, 25, also based at Twentynine Palms, said simply: 
"This is what we are trained to do. When the balloon goes up, we go." 
</P>
<P>
 Luzbetak went to the Persian Gulf during Desert Storm, but this time around he 
has a 6-month-old daughter to think about. "It's just the life I lead," he 
said. "That's what's entailed in being a Marine and a father at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Mark Fernandez, a 30-year-old tank mechanic, said the wives and husbands 
left behind by war or preparations for war always have to take on additional 
duties. "She's got to be mother and father all by herself," Fernandez said of 
his pregnant wife, Yvonn, who will also be caring for an 8-year-old son and a 
2-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 He said every mission away -- whether for combat or for training -- reminds 
him anew of how quickly children grow up and how much he misses them when he is 
gone. "I don't see the kids for a while, and then I come back and they're 
totally different." 
</P>
<P>
 Marines from Camp Pendleton and Twentynine Palms not only served in the Gulf 
War, they've been back to Kuwait every year since to participate in a drill 
called Native Fury. 
</P>
<P>
 They have also participated in extensive desert training exercises in northern 
Africa and were part of the humanitarian relief and security missions in 
Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Col. Jerry Broeckert, a spokesman at Camp Pendleton, said the most 
important thing for troops being called up is to make arrangements so that 
their families will be cared for while they are away. 
</P>
<P>
 He said support groups are being formed to help family members with what is a 
sometimes difficult period of adjustment after troops head for possible battle. 
</P>
<P>
 There was an air of uncertainty Sunday among Marines who frequent San 
Clemente, the seaside town at the north edge of Camp Pendleton. They wondered 
how far the situation would escalate and if they would see combat, as Iraqi 
troops continued to mass near the Kuwaiti border. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst part is waiting to find out," said Lance Cpl. Joseph Garvey, 24. 
"My roommate is being called back (to the Persian Gulf). I'm willing to go too. 
That's my job." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside Coach's Corner Sports Bar and Grill, Lance Cpl. David McCartney hugged 
two sobbing women who had just heard a rumor that their boyfriends -- both Camp 
Pendleton Marines -- might be sent to the Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is word-of-mouth right now," McCartney said as he tried to 
reassure the women. "People aren't sure who's going." 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines who flew out from March Air Force Base Sunday are part of a 
U.S.-led mobilization of up to 38,000 troops as well as aircraft and warships 
to counter Hussein's deployment of nearly 70,000 Iraqi troops near the Kuwaiti 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 Four U.S. Navy ships carrying 2,000 Marines are nearing the northern Gulf, and 
4,000 Marines are due to arrive in Kuwait in the next day or so. 
</P>
<P>
 At 12:30 p.m. Sunday, a sergeant began calling off the names of those in the 
all-male unit, and they began forming a line beside the bulky green transport 
plane. Some stood bareheaded under the hot sun and unseasonably clear blue sky, 
while others wore canvas hats or helmets. A few joked quietly among themselves, 
but many seemed almost grim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to go and do what I have to do . . . and hopefully be home before 
Christmas," said Cpl. Damien Gray, a pink-cheeked, 21-year-old mechanic from 
Pennsylvania who sports a barely noticeable blond mustache. 
</P>
<P>
 Master Sgt. Lee brought up the rear. The way he described the unit's mission 
made it seem almost like a counseling session rather than part of the process 
of preparing for a possible war. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to teach them how to get along," he said. "Everybody in the world 
needs to learn to get along." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as he stepped in, Lee turned around and waved. "We'll be home soon," he 
vowed.
