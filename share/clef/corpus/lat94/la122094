 They must be referring to another Los Angeles: The Plano, Tex.-based J.C. 
Penney Insurance Co. sent out computerized letters across the nation, inserting 
each resident's name and city into its ominous pitch. The theme might pack 
punch in towns the size of Plano, but out here, the Marinelli family wasn't 
exactly jolted by the message. It read:  
</P>
<P>
 "Joseph Marinelli, it's a sad fact that accidents can happen any time, 
anywhere . . . without warning. Even in LOS ANGELES. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Marinelli's wife, Jean: "And I thought it was so safe here." 
</P>
<P>
 So did we, but then we were shocked that there was gambling in Rick's Cafe in 
"Casablanca."

 Fire when ready, Frosty: Lenard Mairs of El Monte, a collector of military 
antiques, has displayed a Civil War-era cannon on his front lawn for 26 years. 
This holiday season, as Michael Lucas' photo shows, he summoned a well-known 
Snowman to active duty, as well as Santa and a couple of aides-de-Claus.

 You don't think Only in L.A. is influential?A few weeks after this column 
published a photo of the unusual car phone at Hampton's Hollywood Cafe -- it's 
a 1959 Nash made into a phone booth -- a similar item appeared in the National 
Enquirer.

 Scales of justice: Several cats and dogs, not to mention one frog, showed up 
in West L.A. the other day to have their photos taken with Santa Claus at a 
fund-raiser for the Friends of Animals Foundation. The croaker, an Australian 
tree-hopper, was accompanied by Mike Harges of Santa Monica. When the 
foundation's Mildred Traeger mentioned that she might kiss the critter to see 
if she could transform it, Harges replied: "That's OK -- but if it turns into a 
prince, you have to take him home."

 Miracle on Los Angeles Street: Well, perhaps that's a bit of an exaggeration. 
But it was an early Christmas at the Midnight Mission for several hundred 
street people who were given $10 each by two car dealers known only as the El 
Dorado Elves. 
</P>
<P>
 The $15,000 handout was a continuation of the 12-year holiday tradition 
started by a colleague known as Cadillac Santa, who died in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "For weeks, people have been coming up to me saying, 'Is Santa coming today?' 
" said mission director Clancy Imislund. "Every day I'd say, 'No.' Today when I 
said, 'I don't know,' the word went out on the street. They knew this was the 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 Imislund said the line outside the mission was the most orderly it had been 
all year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out about the visit after I got to work today," Imislund quipped. "I 
didn't even have time to get my old clothes on." miscelLAny The intracity 
rivalry never stops. No sooner did we run a photo of a crumbling UCLA sign that 
said "RUIN WALK" than we were informed that a multiplex theater in the shadow 
of USC is playing, "Dumb and Dumber."

 An annual holiday favorite, "The Christmas Star" planetarium show, returns to 
the Griffith Observatory through Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zeiss planetarium star projector re-creates the sky as it appeared almost 
2,000 years ago and examines the astronomical events of that time to try to 
identify the star that appeared at the time of Jesus' birth. 
</P>
<P>
 The program also explores the origins of many current holiday traditions in 
the ancient solstice festivals. It will be shown daily at 1:30, 3, 4:30 and 
7:30 p.m., except Christmas Eve, when shows will be at 1:30 and 3 p.m. The 
observatory will be closed on Christmas. (213) 664-1191. 
</P>
<P>
 ASTRONOMY 
</P>
<P>
 * The Winter Solstice will occur at 6:23 p.m. Wednesday, the moment when 
winter begins and the sun reaches its southernmost point in the sky. It also is 
the shortest day of the year -- 9 hours, 53 minutes in Los Angeles. The 
Griffith Observatory's Sky Report has information on this and other 
astronomical events. (213) 663-8171. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History will mark the solstice with a 
performance by local Celtic ensemble Queen Mab at 7 p.m. Wednesday. (805) 
682-4711. 
</P>
<P>
 SCIENCE FOR FAMILIES 
</P>
<P>
 * Children will enjoy learning about bees in the "Bee Observatory," a unique 
working hive community behind glass at the Children's Museum at La Habra. 
Children can hunt for the queen bee, try on a beekeeper's veil and view the 
world through a special "bee eye." (310) 905-9793. 
</P>
<P>
 * After all the gifts are opened and all the food is gone, families can share 
the holidays with the animals at the Los Angeles Zoo in a special program 
called "Presents for Primates (and Others)," beginning next Monday. (213)

AL MARTINEZ: TO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a lot of ways, Dennis Cole is a living metaphor for L.A. He's tall, he's 
blond, he's good-looking and he's an actor. 
</P>
<P>
 If you saw his face, you'd say, sure, I know him, he was on "The Young and the 
Restless" or "The Fall Guy" or "Fantasy Island," and you'd be right. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole has been an actor for 25 years and, unlike most who claim the title, he's 
a working actor, with the kind of credits that make an agent smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Then why does he sit in a quiet Westside condo, with sunlight gleaming in the 
window, and say to me, "The greatest role I ever played was pretending I wanted 
to be alive?" 
</P>
<P>
 It's because of his son Joey. 
</P>
<P>
 It is almost three years to the day since Joey was shot dead near the doorstep 
of his Venice apartment on the kind of balmy L.A. night when no one ought to 
die. 
</P>
<P>
 He and a friend were coming home from the store with bags full of groceries 
when two thugs killed Joey for the $20 he had in his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not a day goes by that I don't think about him," Cole says, holding a 
photograph of them together arm in arm. "I wanted to die, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Joey was 30 when he was murdered. His picture shows a man two inches taller 
than his six-foot-two dad and almost as handsome. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was never easy for him being a celebrity's son," Cole says, looking 
quickly away from the photograph. "He was just putting things together when . . 
. " 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't finish the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are about a thousand murders a year in L.A. This year, for the first 
time since 1989, the figure may dip below that mark. The six-month total of 378 
homicides is slightly below last year's. 
</P>
<P>
 The number includes not only thugs and gangbangers, but old ladies and ice 
cream vendors. It includes kids walking their dogs, and fathers carrying their 
babies. It includes mothers and brothers and people like us. 
</P>
<P>
 At another time, Dennis Cole might have played the kind of role he's living 
now, that of a father whose grief covers him like a funeral shroud. 
</P>
<P>
 He won't do that anymore. He won't take roles based on violence. More than 
most, he understands the relationship of make-believe to reality. He did an 
episode for "Police Story" once, and three copycat crimes followed the crime 
depicted on the show. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't want to be a part of anything that might contribute to the 
statistics of murder. Especially to a statistic like Joey. 
</P>
<P>
 He thinks about Joey at night and he thinks about him in the daytime. Memories 
flash at him like a movie montage of a kid's life: changing his diapers, riding 
the roller coaster, playing doubles in tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 He sees a Joey struggling to find his way, emerging slowly from being a 
celebrity's son to being something on his own, a documentary filmmaker with 
promise. "He was putting together the story of a rock band on the road when he 
was killed," Cole says. Softly: "He had a future." Dec. 20, 1991. Dennis Cole 
was asleep when his telephone rang at 6 a.m. It was a friend who had been 
listening to the radio. He said, "I've got awful news . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It seems dreamlike now as Cole looks back on it, a sleepwalk through the sad 
process of identifying Joey's body, of gathering his things and of seeing his 
son lowered into a grave in the Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's strange," Cole says. "You become like a leper. People avoid you, afraid 
that some of the tragedy might somehow rub off on them." 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't shake his comatose state. On the first anniversary of Joey's 
death, he drove to the street where his son was killed and sat there for hours, 
hearing Joey's laughter, seeing Joey's life. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as he emerged, it became critical for him to find the murderer. He 
badgered the police to solve the crime, and appeared on show after show in his 
quest to find the killer: "Hard Copy," "Prime Suspect," "Murder One." 
</P>
<P>
 But the person who broke a calm, moonlit night with gunfire three years ago 
was never found, and the likelihood is, he never will be. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, in Joey's memory, Cole is working to create an organization called Wake 
Up America. Its intent is to eliminate violence on television, to get guns off 
the street, to streamline the criminal justice system and to counsel crime's 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to do something," he says, dropping from the enthusiasm of his new 
effort to the melancholy reality on which it is based. "It's a role I never 
wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 I wished him well that bright autumn day, but I know how difficult it's going 
to be for others to feel his pain. Only those with a statistic like Joey will 
ever understand.

DEEPER THAN THE BOTTOM LINE; BUSINESS MUST STEP FORWARD FOR ORANGE COUNTY IN 
ITS TIME OF CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Orange County digs out of its financial crisis, it could benefit from the 
expertise of the area's corporate leadership. Giving that help ought to become 
a priority, even if it means that companies, despite having to deal with their 
own leaner environment nowadays, loan some executives or put their full weight 
behind a task force of businesses beginning to address the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Industrial League 
of Orange County say they hope to enlist senior executives from leading 
businesses to meet with county officials and to send a delegation to lobby in 
New York and Washington on the county's behalf. Considering that the decisions 
and fortunes of the county government affect everyone, that's a good idea. 
However, to date there has been less than enthusiastic response from most of 
the heavy hitters. Their posture largely seems to be that they are concerned 
but they lack the time or they believe the county can ride it out alone or they 
are unwilling even to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Nicholson, president of the Industrial League of Orange County, says he 
thinks the help, eventually, will come -- but others aren't so sure. It's true 
that a few business leaders have stepped in, such as the developer of South 
Coast Plaza, Henry Segerstrom, who interceded with the Bank of America. In 
addition, a number of business people have had private, informal talks with 
county officials, and some accountants and bankers have offered their services 
free. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, several weeks into the crisis, business leaders have yet to meet as a 
formal group with government officials and the task force is still struggling 
to enlist the help of important executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Lessons from afar are instructive in regard to the need for a unified and 
high-level response. Felix G. Rohatyn, the architect of New York City's 
recovery from its fiscal disaster in the mid-1970s, observes that getting top 
business executives to play a role in that crisis was crucial to such things as 
the allocation of services and spreading the pain of cutbacks. Roger W. 
Johnson, administrator of the federal General Services Administration and 
former chairman and chief executive of the Irvine-based Western Digital Corp., 
says top business leadership has a responsibility to be involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the challenges facing the county, such as what to do with El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station, point to the common stakes of business and 
government. Even if Orange County businesses are in the forefront of the global 
economy, they -- and everyone else -- will suffer if local government is run 
ineptly. They need to encourage and assist government to be farsighted. 
Rohatyn, Johnson and others striking a similar chord are right: Business people 
have to get more involved in the Orange County recovery.

SAVING THE STATE'S LIFEBLOOD: THAT HISTORIC WATER ACCORD; HOW THE EMBATTLED 
ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT HELPED FORCE THE BIG DELTA DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 20-year-old Endangered Species Act has long been a target for those who 
denounce many of its provisions as too inflexible. But last week's historic 
accord on the use of fresh water from San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento-San 
Joaquin Delta demonstrates anew why America is better off with it and why 
Congress should not eviscerate it, as some congressional Republicans have 
suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, signed by California and the federal government, will protect 
the bay-delta estuary ecosystem, yet provide reliable water supplies to farms 
and cities across the state. The accord ends decades of conflict among water 
users and environmentalists and follows a year of often-intense negotiation 
involving municipal and agricultural water users, environmental groups and 
government officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The pact covers the delta inland from San Francisco Bay to the confluence of 
the Sacramento, the San Joaquin and a host of smaller Northern California 
rivers. It establishes limits on how much fresh water can be diverted from the 
estuary to agriculture and municipal water users. The accord aims also to 
protect imperiled fish species by ensuring that the young survive migration 
through the delta and that diversions do not make breeding waters too salty. 
</P>
<P>
 The delta is perhaps the state's most important water resource. The largest 
wetland habitat in the western United States, the delta collects half of the 
state's annual runoff, provides 60% of the fresh water used in California and 
is the source of irrigation water for almost half of the nation's fruits and 
vegetables. But population growth, urbanization and water-intensive crops, 
combined with a string of drought years, have degraded water quality in the 
delta and threatened some of the more than 120 species of fish that live there. 
</P>
<P>
 Four federal agencies stepped in a year ago and said they would impose a water 
quality plan on the whole region unless state and federal officials could agree 
on an alternative to continuing water diversions. That alternative was unveiled 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The bargaining that produced the pact took place in the shadow of a sword of 
Damocles: the Endangered Species Act. No one wanted the onerous restrictions 
that would follow if that act were invoked now or later on behalf of an 
endangered species such as the delta smelt. Thus the accord was designed to 
safeguard the entire delta habitat as well as the individual species currently 
at risk. It forced dialogue, compromise and, most important, a truce among 
water users that is in everyone's long-term interest. That is the way the act 
works best -- as a threat of tough and arguably punitive action to save 
endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 The act must have real teeth to do that. Defanging it would strip away 
incentive to compromise, and certainly end its value as a last-ditch tool to 
protect threatened wildlife.  
</P>
<P>
 Because application of the Endangered Species Act is cumbersome, it has become 
a lightning rod for those who desire a less intrusive federal presence. But 
undeniably, the threat of its invocation in the delta case worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Some years back, the writer Wallace Stegner pondered: " . . . What do you do 
about aridity if you are a nation accustomed to plenty and impatient of 
restrictions and led westward by pillars of fire and cloud? You may deny it for 
a while. Then you must either try to engineer it out of existence or adapt to 
it." We in California have done as much engineering as anywhere, witness the 
massive pumps and aqueducts that carry fresh water hundreds of miles from the 
delta to Southern California and the Central Valley. Now, with more than a 
nudge from the Endangered Species Act -- and some goodwill and hard work among 
the negotiating parties -- the bay-delta accord stands as a signal that we 
have, at last, begun to adapt. 
</P>

JEFFE ON TERM LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sherry Bebitch Jeffe is at it again; blaming term limits for the latest 
political crisis in Sacramento (Opinion, Dec. 11). For the past four years, 
Jeffe has tried to blame legislative term limits for just about every political 
dilemma, problem or crisis taking place in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 In "A Preview of Life in Sacramento Under Term Limits" readers are invited, by 
direct assertion or implication, to variously blame term limits for: 
legislative gridlock, the Assembly's inability to select a Speaker, Republicans 
who can't count to 41, the fast emergence of the recall "as the new political 
weapon of choice," and the transformation of the Assembly speakership into "the 
powerless head of a very large, dysfunctional family" a la the Queen of 
England. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of this is sheer fantasy, a tribute to the power of Jeffe's creativity 
but unsubstantiated by any systematic empirical research. Term limits didn't 
cause a closely divided Assembly, the electorate did. Redistricting is a better 
explanation for partisan turnover in the Assembly than term limits. Neither did 
they cause Paul Horcher's (R-Diamond Bar) defection, which was far more 
personal than institutional or Jim Brulte's (R-Rancho Cucamonga) braggadocio, 
which is attributable to style, not legislative experience. Nor did term limits 
induce the reaction of voters to Horcher's "betrayal" or Steve Kuykendall's 
(R-Rancho Palos Verdes) use of tobacco money to slip into the Assembly. As for 
whether term limits will subsequently make it impossible for any member of the 
Assembly to develop the legislative and personal power enjoyed by Willie Brown, 
most Californians would probably say "amen." 
</P>
<P>
 Various political scientists around the nation have been conducting empirical 
and formal research on the impact of legislative term limits. Much of this 
research is ongoing, but what has been published (or reported) sharply 
contradicts Jeffe's speculative assessments.

though California voters should somehow feel guilt over term limits.

 It is true, the state Assembly has given up and gone home. Wouldn't it be 
wonderful if they stayed home awhile -- without pay of course!

 * I strongly agree with Assemblywomen Jackie Speier (D-Burlingame) to add a no 
vote category to the general election ballot. (Sacramento File, Dec. 7). But I 
feel a "none of the above" category, as she has suggested, is too negative and 
might be seen as an insult to those running for office. Instead I suggest a "no 
selection" category, which does not sound offensive, yet gives the voter a no 
vote choice. This category is definitely needed and should have been available 
long ago.

SCHOOL WINTER PROGRAMS

<P>
 Re "A Holiday for All," Dec. 14: 
</P>
<P>
 I appreciate the Los Angeles Unified School District's effort to replace 
Christmas pageants with winter programs and holiday celebrations. If Sara 
DeVito Hardman, a Pat Robertson's political spokeswoman, thinks that it's sad 
and that "Christmas is such a beautiful thing," well so are Hanukkah, Kwanzaa 
and other cultural events celebrated during this time of the year. The tyranny 
and monopoly of Christmas does not belong in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially despicable is the after-Christmas custom of going around the 
classroom and asking children what they got for Christmas. I had to make 
something up or be ostracized. My third-grade teacher actually had the gall to 
ask the children to bring in a toy they got for Christmas. Faking that was very 
difficult and degrading for me. The children figured out that the old, worn-out 
doll that I brought in wasn't given to me as a Christmas present. 
</P>
<P>
 Most humiliating were being forced to participate in Christmas pageants, help 
set up Nativity scenes, and sing holy Christmas songs even when they violated 
my beliefs. Not singing meant failing music and bad cooperation grades on my 
report cards, not an acceptable alternative for me. I remember how the 
non-Christian children would mouth the words during parts of the songs which 
were particularly sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, non-Christian children were a minority at the school I attended 
between kindergarten and the eighth-grade, but the faculty and staff knew they 
were there. Yet, Christmas decorations and "Merry Christmases" ruled. Never was 
a Hanukkah menorah seen or discussed. No Jewish child was ever wished a "Happy 
Hanukkah." While Christmas was rammed down our throats, no time was spent 
learning about other cultures or religions. Worse, the policy of Christmas 
exclusivity did nothing to teach positive values such as tolerance and respect 
for each other's differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardman and other members of Pat Robertson's coalition believe Christmas 
pageants are memorable. I agree. For me, they were as memorable as nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
 My thanks to the students of Bellagio Road Newcomer School for pointing out 
that it's crazy for anyone to want to come down a chimney. Now that I thought 
about it for a second, it is a ridiculous way to enter a home. Besides, there 
are too many children who don't have fireplaces in their homes. They must feel 
terribly left out.

 Re "Two Views on the Fall of Joycelyn Elders," Commentary, Dec. 13: 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Thomas asserts that young people should be denied access to condoms in the 
same way that purchase of tobacco products is restricted for those under 18 
years of age. There is no justifiable comparison of these two 
commodities.Tobacco products will eventually kill the user; condom use may save 
the user's life. Furthermore (and whether we like it or not), easy access to 
condoms and full social acceptance of their use will do more to prevent the 
"epidemic of teen-age pregnancies, growing numbers of young unwed mothers and 
rampant venereal disease" than any public policy limit set by government. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Thomas' assertion to the contrary, it is not politicians' primary 
responsibility to legislate morality.

 * Deborah Mathis, like Elders, does not understand the concept of 
self-control. Instead of upholding virtuous behavior, they promote ideas that 
bring standards down. They worry more about the symptoms of our social ills 
than the causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathis states that we don't want to hear the truth, and that Elders' passions 
are fueled by seeing one too many tragedies. Instead of having real compassion 
by teaching someone right behavior, Elders wants to legalize drugs, give 
condoms to elementary school children, divert money from studying diseases that 
affect the elderly to AIDS research because the elderly are going to die of 
something. 
</P>
<P>
 Elders is a social relativist. I don't know if she feels anything is really 
wrong, except for maybe smoking.

DWP BILL DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At age 76, I have just discovered the meaning of "you can't fight City Hall." 
</P>
<P>
 Our company has been in business in Los Angeles since 1923.For many years our 
electric bills have averaged $40,000 per month. Recently, we had a difference 
of opinion with the Department of Water and Power amounting to $3,300. We went 
to Small Claims Court to present ourcase. 
</P>
<P>
 It was our understanding that no attorneys are to represent either side in 
Small Claims Court; citizen against citizen, right? Wrong! We were in court on 
Dec. 5, and the DWP was a no-show. DWP merely sent a letter to the judge from 
the Los Angeles city attorney and that was enough to lose our case. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks, Los Angeles. Perhaps we should have sued for millions.

 As executive director of Holy Family Services, Counseling and Adoption, I must 
really protest the statement made in the Robert Scheer Column Left, "Returning 
to Bad Old Days of Orphanages" (Dec. 11). 
</P>
<P>
 I am bothered by the erroneous statement, "Vista del Mar runs the only 
licensed adoption program in Los Angeles County."This is not true. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Family Services has been providing quality licensed adoption and foster 
care services in Los Angeles and Orange counties since our inception in 1949. 
In addition, we belong to the California Assn. of Adoption Agencies, which is 
an umbrella group for many licensed adoption agencies both in Los Angeles 
County and statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 It is often very difficult to get attention paid to the field of adoption in 
the press. To omit all other adoption agencies such as ourselves doing this 
good and vital work is an omission that cannot go uncorrected.

HUNGER IN SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The letter from Terry Morhous (Nov. 30) brought back memories. When I was 
growing up during the Depression there was a need for food in the schools.The 
good women of the town made big pots of nourishing food every day. We had 
beans, stew, beans, soup and beans. The "big boys" from the sixth grade carried 
the pots to each class for the teacher to ladle into our cups (brought from 
home). I was lucky -- I could afford to pay 5 cents for my full cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Today there would be food inspectors, disability claims and child labor laws 
discussed. Something to be said for the good old days after all!

PERSPECTIVE ON NORTH KOREA; A SPARK THAT MIGHT IGNITE; U.S. POLICY IS MIRED IN

 An incident is some occurrence that may be trivial or serious, but that has 
effects wildly out of proportion to the actual damage done. Thus we speak of a 
terrorist "incident" when a bombing or assassination sets in motion a train of 
events that would not normally be expected given the limited nature of the 
actual assault. The assassination of the Austrian crown prince in 1914 led to 
World War I; the refusal of the Cossacks to fire on the people of St. 
Petersburg in 1917 led to the Russian Revolution. The downing of a U.S. 
helicopter by North Korea may also be such an incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The pattern of events in the Pacific since the end of the Cold War five years 
ago has been one of drift. Old Cold War alignments disguise the extent of the 
shift in the global balance of power to Asia. American military deployments add 
up to armed impotence under the new situations, and Americans are ill-prepared 
to cope with this development. Meanwhile, what passes for strategic thought is 
largely public-relations posturing, bureaucratic infighting over turf and the 
pretense of competence by political officials in the main Pacific powers. 
</P>
<P>
 Other likely candidates for a catalytic incident include the imminent death of 
Deng Xiaoping in China and the reversion of Hong Kong to mainland Chinese rule 
in 1997. But the Korean situation is, and long has been, a potential powder 
keg. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States became involved in Korea 45 years ago not because of a 
Korean civil war but because of the influence of the former Soviet Union and 
China on the peninsula and our belief that communist aggression in Korea was 
part of a global advance of communism into any susceptible society. We fought 
on the side of the Republic of Korea against armies from the North because 
North Korea's backers were the Soviets and China. But since the Seoul Olympics 
of 1988, the Republic of Korea has had friendly relations with both Russia and 
China and now has formal diplomatic ties with both. Because of the war of 
1950-53, we have ignored North Korea's claims of legitimacy which it gained in 
the struggle against its former Japanese overlords and, as elsewhere in Asia, 
we refused to see that Asian communism was largely a vehicle for anti-colonial 
nationalism. Our presence in Korea is still locked in a Cold War mold. We have 
37,000 front-line troops there, and North Korea has been trying to catch our 
attention by developing nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, North Korea's intransigence over nuclear weapons looked 
like it would be the incident that would finally begin to alter Cold War 
arrangements in East Asia. Through adroit diplomacy and by beating back 
Pentagon enthusiasts for "surgical strikes," the United States seems to have 
defused a nuclear confrontation -- even though we still do not know exactly 
what happened. All we know for certain is that Kim Il Sung saw Jimmy Carter and 
died. We are still waiting to find out whether that was a natural death and we 
must remain alert to the probable instabilities of a successor regime in 
Pyongyang headed by Kim's son. 
</P>
<P>
 But one thing is clear: The United States no longer has any reason to 
intervene in a Korean civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republic of Korea has twice the population and 10 times the productive 
power of the North, from which come repeated reports of starvation among the 
population. Seoul should be fully capable of defending itself in any conflict 
not involving external powers or nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States should continue to guarantee the Republic of Korea's 
security from nuclear attack but American ground forces should be withdrawn. 
Many American analysts agree but always add that the present time is not 
appropriate. They fail to note that there will never be a perfect time. To 
leave U.S. ground forces there makes them hostage to possible events over which 
they have no control. The unification of Korea is today a topic of Korean 
politics. We can help, but we should not be caught in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the significance of the downing last week of a U.S. Army helicopter 
that had strayed into North Korean air space. The pilots probably did not know 
where they were; but they had no real business being in Korea at all, and were 
not ready for the kind of hair-trigger mentality that exists along the Korean 
demilitarized zone. They were there because of Pentagon inertia and the lack of 
any kind of American strategic vision for post-Cold War Asia. One pilot died. 
When President Clinton said, "This tragic loss of life was unnecessary," he did 
not know how close to home the responsibility for that death actually lies. 
Unless the United States reconceives its military, political and economic role 
in Asia, either this incident or some other one will prove to be the detonator 
for a larger, more serious explosion.

COLUMN RIGHT/ MICKEY EDWARDS: GETTING THE BIG BOYS OFF OUR BACKS; OUR DEMOCRACY 
IS ROOTED IN THE 10TH AMENDMENT; IN THE NEW CONGRESS, IT WILL BE REDISCOVERED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICKEY EDWARDS, Mickey Edwards, chairman of the House Republican Policy 
Committee before leaving Congress in 1992, teaches at the John F. Kennedy 
School of Government and writes a column. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For many years, liberals have been faithful to their own abridged version of 
the Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, the left has willingly subscribed to the Constitution's 
restrictions on government authority, the protections of speech and the press, 
the constraints on police power. Liberals have even acknowledged the existence 
of the Second Amendment, which protects the citizen's right to own a gun, 
although the acknowledgment comes mostly in the form of attempts at 
circumvention. And they not only honor the freedom of religious practice, they 
even go the Constitution one better, demanding a strict separation of church 
and state, which is not at all what the founders had in mind. Under the 
protection of liberals in Congress and the courts, the left's version of the 
Bill of Rights has been relatively safe; the first nine amendments have 
received either allegiance or acknowledgment. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, conservatives are in charge, and as they have begun to forage 
around in the debris of Big Government, they have found still another 
amendment, a 10th, buried and almost forgotten, a remnant of the days before 
the great experiment of modern liberalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the constitutional amendments that make up the Bill of Rights, the 10th 
is the most direct. In much of the world, governments are thought to grant 
rights to their citizens. In the United States, however, political and civil 
rights are presumed to belong to the people themselves, by right of birth. 
Unless those rights are specifically delegated to government, they are retained 
by the people. It's a revolutionary idea. In fact, it's the revolutionary idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Just to make sure that nobody missed the point, the framers stated the idea 
succinctly: All rights not delegated to the government were retained by the 
states or the people. In other words, power resides with the people or that 
branch of government closest to them. 
</P>
<P>
 It is that concept -- government at the local level -- that Republicans will 
restore. Along with the separation of powers between the different branches of 
the federal government, the Founding Fathers balanced power between the 
national government, which had only that authority specifically assigned to it, 
and the state governments, which had all the rest. During the years of the 
liberal expansion, with a proliferation of federal agencies and regulations, 
Americans came increasingly to think of "government" as "Washington." That will 
no longer be the case. 
</P>
<P>
 To some extent, the flow of power back to the states will be driven by the 
less visible half of the Republican sweep in last month's elections: the new 
Republican domination of state governments. And they are determined to set 
their own agendas. They will push hard for a return to federalism, the division 
of power between national government and the states, and the new Republican 
Congress will be eager to go along. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberals, too, paid lip service to the role of the states: State governments 
were encouraged to experiment with alternative programs to deliver health care, 
or regulate traffic, or police cities, or provide welfare benefits. But the 
idea was that the Big Boys in Washington would then evaluate these "pilot 
programs," decide which ones worked best and nationalize them. 
</P>
<P>
 At other times, faced with budget constraints but unwilling to forgo the right 
to order local governments how to behave, Congress simply issued regulatory 
orders to states, which then had to raise taxes to pay the cost of 
implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Republicans have indicated that they will reduce the number of these 
unfunded mandates. If state and local governments are required to implement 
federal regulations, they will be given the funds to do so. More and more, 
however, they will simply be given block grants and allowed the flexibility to 
design programs geared to local circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Where this will lead, eventually, is to the federal government turning 
programs entirely back to those governments closest to the people -- the state 
and municipal governments, where the mayors live across town, the council 
members may live next door and the legislators and governors live close enough 
to be pestered by concerned citizens. As they perceive that they have an 
ability to be heard and to affect outcomes, more citizens will be encouraged to 
participate in the political process. 
</P>
<P>
 The root of American Democracy is in the 10th Amendment to the Constitution, 
the anchor of the Bill of Rights. It is about to be rediscovered.

FITNESS: BODY WATCH; BUILDING A SLEEKER PHYSIQUE IN 6 WEEKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Until recently, Jolinda Saindon was a sporadic exerciser. She'd go in-line 
skating or cycling when the weather and spirit moved her. Then the 29-year-old 
West Los Angeles waitress took a spill while cycling on city streets and said 
"No thanks" to that workout. 
</P>
<P>
 What she wanted was a regular routine she'd stick with, fair weather or foul 
-- one that would leave her with more energy. That was her motivation for 
enrolling in the "6-Week Personal Reconstruction Program" at Better Bodies 
Cross Training Center in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Like several similar programs, it's geared around the concept that six weeks 
can yield noticeable results while persuading clients to adopt a healthier 
lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Choices: Six-week programs designed to launch (or relaunch) you down the 
health and fitness path vary greatly in terms of costs and contents. But here's 
a sampling: 
</P>
<P>
 * The "6-Week Personal Reconstruction Program" at Better Bodies Cross-Training 
Center offers nutritional counseling, one-on-one personal training, use of the 
workout facility and a weekly massage for $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "In six weeks, you'll reduce body fat and increase metabolism," says Dana 
Vatanpour, one of the center's personal trainers. Clients are encouraged to 
check with their physicians before beginning the program and to alert the 
trainer to any special medical conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Michael Thurmond's 6 Week Body Makeover includes a personal trainer for four 
weekly one-hour workouts conducted at area health clubs, a personalized eating 
program and analysis of food diaries, which clients fax in regularly. Both the 
exercise and eating programs must be approved by each client's doctor, says 
Thurmond, who charges $840 to $900 for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 * The FreshStart program is offered through a handful of health clubs and 
through employee wellness programs at some major corporations. Designed for 
exercise dropouts, the six-week program includes twice weekly slow-paced 
workouts, says Mark Caffey, spokesman for the Austin-based company that 
launched the program a year ago. It includes not only gentle exercise but 
discussion and education about exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 In development is a series of exercise and nutrition videos geared around the 
six-week time frame, says Gin Miller, an Atlanta fitness expert and consultant 
for Step Reebok. Her first, expected out by January, will be "Six Weeks to the 
Wedding." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Premise: Why six weeks? 
</P>
<P>
 "Six weeks can give you a start," says John Foreyt, director of the Nutrition 
Research Clinic at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. "The average (obese) 
client can make changes for 42 days," he says. After that, motivation can 
decline. "But the chances of making changes in exercise or diet permanent 
(after just six weeks) are nil," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 So how long is long enough to make fitness and nutrition practices solid 
habits? 
</P>
<P>
 Probably six months to two years, Foreyt estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Short-Term Results: Near the end of her six-week "reconstruction," Saindon 
was elated. She'd dropped 12 pounds, reduced body fat and believes she has 
found an exercise program -- weight training, stair-climbing and treadmill 
walking -- she can stick with. 
</P>
<P>
 Her eating habits have improved too. "I used to have some coffee in the 
morning and eat nothing all day (until dinner)," she says. But she soon learned 
that eating wisely before workouts gave her more energy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Caveats: Foreyt won't advise people against six-week programs nor 
encourage them, but he has some advice for those who do enroll. "Don't focus on 
the outcome, but the process," he says. He considers making the switch to a 
healthier lifestyle, with better eating and exercise habits, "a process rather 
than an outcome." 
</P>
<P>
 If you're debating whether to work harder first on diet or on exercise, Foreyt 
advises focusing first on exercise. "Exercise leads to a sense of well-being," 
he says. That well-being, in turn, leads to a sense of control. And that 
control can make it easier to improve eating habits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perspective: "People need to understand they are not going to rebuild Rome 
overnight," says John Duncan, chief of clinical applications for the Cooper 
Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas. Within six weeks, exercisers might 
notice weight loss and increased energy, he says. There might be improvements 
in their cholesterol levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The programs can motivate people to get going again," Duncan says. "But after 
six weeks, that's just the beginning of the good news." 
</P>
<P>
 After that, he suggests, people should approach exercise much the same way as 
taking medication for a chronic condition. "Unless you take your nearly daily 
dose of exercise, the benefits you worked so hard to achieve are going to start 
being lost."

DOWNTIME: SNUGGLING UP WITH A GOOD MYSTERY NOVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ilike to sit in the center of my bed, lean against a lot of fluffy pillows 
with my favorite plaid blanket over my legs, and read a good mystery book.I 
make myself some hot cinnamon apple tea and drink it while reading. Spending my 
time in bed is especially relaxing and soothing when it's raining or on a gray, 
hazy day. This helps me unwind and forget the world for a while. Afterward, I 
always feel recharged.

RSVP / ORANGE COUNTY; COMING IN FROM THE COLD; 'WINTER NIGHT FANTASY' GIVES 
SUPPORTERS OF ST. JOSEPH HOSPITAL A WARM FEELING 
</P>

<P>
 Carolers, bell ringers and a sleigh filled with polar bears turned the Newport 
Beach Marriott Hotel into a "Winter Night Fantasy" for the 17th annual Todos 
Seasonal Soiree. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 150 guests in sparkling holiday attire showed up Thursday for the 
Yuletide gala staged by Todos, a support group for St. Joseph Hospital in 
Orange. The $125-per-person event netted about $20,000 for the hospital's 
Emergency Care Center. Yuletide Spirit 
</P>
<P>
 Men in tuxedos with festive ties and cummerbunds and women in glittering 
dresses were greeted at the hotel ballroom by the caroling group Sing, Sing, 
Sing -- a quartet dressed in Victorian costumes. Inside, a small stage was 
decked with snow-covered trees and a sleigh of stuffed bears. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to make people feel warm, like they just came in from a crisp, cool 
evening," said Mike Conkey, event chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests first shopped for last-minute gifts at a silent auction. Items ranged 
from a tour of the Anaheim Police Department to an $18,000 Schimmel Chippendale 
grand piano, which pianist John Ehrhart demonstrated by playing Christmas 
carols. Opening bid on the piano was $8,000; there were no takers, so it will 
be sold on consignment. 
</P>
<P>
 After a dinner of chicken stuffed with crab meat and loin of lamb followed by 
creme brulee , the caroling quartet visited each table and sang requests. 
Afterward the Praise Ringers bell choir rang out Yuletide tunes. Real-Life ER 
</P>
<P>
 Todos, which means "everyone" in Spanish, was formed in 1978 to support St. 
Joseph Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal is to get everybody from all walks of life involved," said Kate 
Reeves, former president of Todos. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the gala will be part of Todos' five-year, $500,000 campaign to 
build the hospital's new emergency room, which will break ground in January and 
is expected to be completed by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emergency room was originally set up for 40 patients a day, and we're 
running 160," said Charlie Kovac, a hospital trustee. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves understands the dire need for a larger ER. She was director of St. 
Joseph's emergency department for 14 years before retiring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even when I was there, we were cramped. When you have to crawl over one 
patient to get to another, it's time for a new ER," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves, who has served as a consultant for the TV show "ER," said the program 
accurately portrays the crowded conditions of a real emergency room. That 
night's "ER" episode was based on an actual event at St. Joseph: 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them we had a Santa Claus who had a seizure. He came in wearing his 
full regalia," she said. She was taping the show on her VCR. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the party-goers were: Dennis Monge, Todos president, with wife Judith 
Harrison-Monge and sons Matt and Mike; Larry Ainsworth, president and chief 
executive officer of St. Joseph Hospital, and his wife, Laura; Robert Eagan, 
director of St. Joseph's Cancer Center, and his wife, Mary Beth; Dominick and 
Zora Gentile; George Holmes; Pat Kelly; Artie Killen; Milly Kovac; Heidi Muth; 
William and Rosalind Ostermiller; Jim and Linda Pierog; David and Virginia 
Reed; Reed and Rita Sprinkel; Richard and Jennifer Statuto, and Jevelyn 
Yonchar. KATHRYN BOLD

BOOK REVIEW: NONFICTION; BRAVE NEW WORLD OUSTS FREUD'S DREAMS; THE CHEMISTRY OF 
CONSCIOUS STATES, HOW THE BRAIN CHANGES ITS MIND BY J. ALLAN HOBSON LITTLE, 
BROWN; $22.95, 300 PAGES

 Brain, mind, body, soul: understanding and explaining the connections between 
them absorbed the attentions of psychologists, neurologists and forensic 
physicians or "alienists" at the end of the last century. As this century draws 
to a close, the extraordinary technological revolution in the neurosciences has 
shattered the visual barrier of the opaque skull: inside it has found not 
spiritual and physical entities, folding upon each other as the Christian 
Trinity subsumes three in one, but a single brain-mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts in imaging have begun to map the entire brain, from the frontal 
cortex, where much of our conscious thinking occurs, to the brain stem that 
controls our heartbeats and the movement of our lungs. Other scientists are 
discovering just as much by examining the brain's production of the chemicals 
-- neurotransmitters -- that regulate our appetites and moods. 
</P>
<P>
 Where in this brave new world of molecules and neurons does a psychiatrist 
trained in the almost quaint school of Freudian psychoanalysis fit? J. Allan 
Hobson, professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and director of 
the sleep laboratory at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center, will tell you 
-- if you have the perseverance to read his new book, "The Chemistry of 
Conscious States." He fits in like a betrayed lover, damning Freud for having 
begun to look for a science of the mind early in his career, only to leap into 
the fairy-tale world of dreams and sexually based iconographies like the 
Oedipus complex, thereby wasting the time of so many psychiatrists of a certain 
age. 
</P>
<P>
 "The influence of Freud has held the field back intellectually," Hobson 
explains. "Freud's mistaken notion of how dreams are actually constructed 
contaminates the rest of his theory of mental life." 
</P>
<P>
 For dreams, as well as the other activities the brain engages in while we 
sleep, are Hobson's specialty. He describes his observations in the sleep 
clinic of both healthy volunteers and patients. To show us how the different 
stages of sleep reflect and affect the sleepers' lives, he focuses on two 
patients.  
</P>
<P>
 While both spin illogical scenarios in their dreams, the "healthy dreamer" 
dreams while she is sleeping, while the "psychotic" one dreams when he is 
awake, which we call a hallucination. Dreams and hallucinations are actually 
the same mental phenomenon, Hobson is telling us: only one is controlled by the 
dreamer while the other is not. The purpose of dreams, he suggests, may be 
"homeopathic. We have a sleep seizure to avoid a waking seizure. We dream so as 
not to hallucinate." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreaming, Hobson explains, is one of three brain-mind states. The others are 
sleeping and waking. During each state the brain releases different chemical 
neurotransmitters. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobson builds a strong case for the importance of healthy sleep habits, and he 
offers do-it-yourself advice for keeping a sleep journal and taking control of 
your personal sleep life. He dwells on the role of REM, or rapid eye movement, 
in mental health. Deprived of REM sleep, people hallucinate and laboratory rats 
die from infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobson is most interesting when he describes how to keep a sleep diary, 
denounces the "myth of Edison," (that a couple of hours sleep is all we need), 
and explains what he calls the brain-mind's role in sleepwalking and controlled 
dreaming. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the book takes a curious turn as Hobson progresses, as if he changed 
his mind about what it all means as he was writing. He is bemused by the 
appearance of drugs in the Prozac family. 
</P>
<P>
 He prefers to direct the rank and file of patients to learn to use sleep, the 
"brain-mind's own resident physician," by exercising, meditating and taking 
control. But the success of the Prozac drugs leads him to a conclusion that 
questions the value of the dream monitoring he spent so many pages describing. 
</P>
<P>
 These drugs reduce both REM sleep and the chemical balance it creates. This 
leads Hobson to the conclusion that it is the chemicals that matter, and 
dreaming may be only an epiphenomena -- whose only value may be entertainment 
-- an otherwise unnecessary experience if we can balance our brain-mind 
chemistry artificially.

ART REVIEW; GARY HILL'S COMPELLING, CONFUSING VIDEO SHOW; MOCA'S SURVEY OF THIS 
IMPORTANT BODY OF WORK LOSES SOMETHING IN SETUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Gary Hill's 1991 video sculpture "Between Cinema and a Hard Place," 23 
television tubes trailing hundreds of feet of tangled coaxial cable spill 
across a low-slung platform and onto the floor, rather like electronic entrails 
ripped from the belly of a postindustrial beast. Whatever the content of the 
images that flicker across the assorted screens, it's the bodily connotation of 
the sculpture that registers most immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 These aren't TV monitors and certainly not consoles we're watching. Instead, 
they're television's guts. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey of the Santa Monica-born, Seattle-based artist's work that opened 
Sunday at the Museum of Contemporary Art includes nine video installations (one 
of which was unavailable for preview) and six single-channel videotapes, all 
made since 1981. Together, they chronicle Hill's effort to ground consciousness 
within physical, palpable experience, using video as a modern metaphor for 
awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 The show includes such wonderfully compelling installations as "Crux" 
(1983-87), "Suspension of Disbelief" (1991-92) and the new "Remarks on Color" 
(1994). Alas, it is nonetheless ineffective in presenting this important body 
of work. MOCA, for reasons we'll get to in a moment, has made it unnecessarily 
difficult to follow Hill's trajectory. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's earliest installation attached the video medium directly to the 
artist's own body, while paradoxically keeping most of that body from view. 
"Crux" was made by strapping five portable cameras to the artist's torso and 
extremities, with the lenses aimed down at each foot, out at each hand and up 
at his head. Hill, rigged in this fashion, set out to explore the grounds of a 
ruined castle in a wooded area of Upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
 For the installation that resulted, five monitors are attached to a gallery 
wall in a monumental, cruciform shape. The reference to a crucified figure is 
plain, even though the images on the screens show only the artist's head, hands 
and feet; glimpses of an earthly journey through an autumnal, ruined place are 
seen in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 Like carvings of the crucifixion from certain regions of Southern Mexico, 
which also show only these five extremities affixed to a cross, the body is 
pointedly absent from Hill's "Crux." Its absence conveys an unexpected power: 
You know the physical body is the source from which these arduous pictures of 
worldly experience were made, but only the loci of human consciousness and 
suffering are apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 This bodily reference is compounded in "Suspension of Disbelief." The 
sculpture exploits the idea of television as a medium for communication, by 
making it the site for a sexual fusion between male and female. 
</P>
<P>
 An aluminum beam is suspended between two walls, slightly more than six feet 
off the floor -- just above the physical height of a standing viewer. Thirty 
black-and-white television tubes are set edge to edge along the length of the 
beam, their electronic innards visible from behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The imagery on the screens consists of tight, quick-cut scans of nude, 
reclining bodies -- one male, one female -- which are interspersed with (and 
seem to melt into) one another. The horizontal linearity of the sculpture, in 
which your eye "reads" the imagery as it might words on a page, by scanning 
rapidly from left to right, ineluctably invokes language as a system of bodily 
consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Language, like the human body, is a central feature of Hill's art. Sometimes 
it's signaled by pictures of people reading, as in portions of the installation 
"Circular Breathing" (1994) or in several single-channel tapes; sometimes it's 
implied in the sculpture's composition, as in the video image projected onto an 
open book in 1990's electronic spin on Miss Muffet's tale, "And Sat Down Beside 
Her." 
</P>
<P>
 More profoundly, a discreet suggestion of "the word made flesh" is inescapable 
in "Suspension of Disbelief," just as it is in the earlier "Crux." Hill, more 
convincingly than any other video artist, has made use of the way in which the 
television screen is replacing the printed page. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Remarks on Color," a single-channel video projection continuously shown in 
MOCA's auditorium, is the newest piece in the show. A young child with blonde 
hair and wearing a blue dress reads from a red book, sounding out phonetically 
the abstruse ideas of Ludwig Wittgenstein's famously impenetrable theory of the 
logic of color concepts. Her dutiful (and uncomprehending) recitation, subsumed 
within the red-yellow-blue color scheme, makes for slyly funny child's play. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the survey, which was organized by the Henry Art Gallery at the 
University of Washington, is rather confusing. Inexplicably, four of the nine 
video installations identified in the catalogue checklist turn out not to be in 
the MOCA show. (Substitutions have been made.) 
</P>
<P>
 It's not unusual for exhibition checklists to change when a show goes on tour; 
however, unlike a survey of traditional painting or sculpture, which has scores 
of examples from which to choose, a survey of video installations inevitably 
has a smaller body of work on which to draw. Here, nearly half the curator's 
apparent first choices are absent -- two for reasons of space, one because it 
was recently shown in the area and another because it's not completed, 
according to a museum spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, the show is laid out at cross purposes with itself. Audio is a critical 
component of most of Hill's work, but the gallery space allotted to the survey 
at MOCA is insufficient to meet the most basic demands of the art. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The tapes and installations, packed in cheek by jowl, create a collective 
cacophony that makes it nearly impossible to experience any one of them as a 
discrete entity. Sound from the work next door -- or even echoing down the hall 
-- distractingly intrudes. (Pay extra close attention, for example, or you'll 
miss the quietly crucial audio element of "Searchlight.") MOCA's planning for 
the show has served the art poorly. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the recent presentation of Hill's work at the Long Beach Museum of Art, 
as well as a current show at the Lannan Foundation featuring two installations 
by the artist (including the haunting "Tall Ships," which was a highlight of 
the 1992 Documenta exhibition in Germany), the MOCA survey could have been the 
anchor for an unusually thorough overview locally of a significant artist's 
developing achievement. It's not impossible to get a handle on Hill's work at 
the MOCA show, but it's an awful lot harder than it should be.

 Case Closed: A threat to withdraw the R rating of Miramax Films' "Ready to 
Wear" was dropped Monday by the Motion Picture Assn. of America after the 
distribution company won MPAA approval for a revised ad for the film, the MPAA 
said. A hearing scheduled for Thursday on the possible rating revocation was 
canceled. The dispute centered around film-related advertising that featured a 
semi-nude photo of supermodel Helena Christensen. The MPAA said the ad had not 
received approval from its Advertising Administration. Last Friday, Miramax 
used the image again in trade ads protesting the MPAA's policy, which prompted 
the threat of a revocation. On Monday, the MPAA released a letter from its 
counsel, Richard M. Cooper, to Miramax's counsel, Alan M. Dershowitz, 
explaining the organization's position. An MPAA spokesperson said Miramax had 
responded by agreeing that the ad would only be published in black-and-white. 
The Robert Altman-directed film opens on Christmas Day.

 'Seduction' Suit: Backers of "The Last Seduction" are planning a press 
conference this morning to announce their next move in an effort to qualify the 
film for Academy Award consideration. Heck, everyone knows their lawyer is 
Pierce O'Donnell (who won all that loot for Art Buchwald against Paramount 
Pictures) so a lawsuit must be brewing. The problem is that the film, which is 
bringing accolades to star Linda Fiorentino, was shown on HBO before it went 
into the movie theaters. And the rules of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts 
and Sciences say that films that open on the tube can't be considered for 
Oscars. The rub is that the New York Film Critics Assn., which plays by its own 
rules, last week deemed Fiorentino the year's best actress for her role in the 
film. And the L.A. critics recently gave a special award to director John Dahl 
for his efforts. Distributor October Films and ITC Entertainment Group say they 
have appealed to the academy without success. Thus, the press conference at 10 
a.m. today at the Four Seasons Hotel and, it's expected, a quick trip to Los 
Angeles Superior Court.

 Support for 'Pulp': Texas film critics came riding to the support of their Los 
Angeles colleagues, agreeing that "Pulp Fiction" is the best film of the year. 
The 20 Texans, whose vote was revealed in Austin over the weekend, joined 
growing pre-Oscar support for the dark comedy about hitmen and racketeers in 
Los Angeles. Last week, the New York Film Critics went thataway, picking "Quiz 
Show" as their favorite flick.

 Brits Clear 'Killers': British movie censors said Monday they have reversed 
themselves on blocking the release of director Oliver Stone's "Natural Born 
Killers." The British Board of Film Classification had banned release of the 
film in November because of alleged links between the picture's violence and 
killings in the United States and France. But the board has now granted an 
adult rating, saying there was no proof "ordinary people had been turned into 
killers by being exposed to a particular film." TELEVISION

 The Nation Watched: President Clinton's speech from the Oval Office Thursday 
night attracted about 60% of the viewing audience in Nielsen's 32 big-city 
markets. NBC, which had "Seinfeld" and "ER" waiting in the wings, averaged a 
14.3 rating and a 22% audience share, compared to 9.8/14% for ABC, 7.8/12% for 
CBS and 6.7/10% for Fox. The address and GOP response also were carried on PBS

affiliates statewide. And L.A.-oriented "Visiting . . . With Huell Howser" will

TV REVIEW; SOLID BUT SCARCELY MAGICAL 'NUTCRACKER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although "The Nutcracker" was created for the St. Petersburg company now known 
as the Kirov, the ballet remained out of repertory there for decades. Two years 
ago, however, on its 100th anniversary, it was remounted for an American tour 
in a 1934 version by Vassily Vainonen. 
</P>
<P>
 It is that Kirov "Nutcracker" that comes to Bravo cable twice tonight in a 
solid though scarcely magical performance led by Larissa Lezhnina and Victor 
Baranov. This is not a traditional "Nutcracker" (with real children), but the 
ancestor of the prevalent "adult" interpretations -- in particular the 
psychosexual Baryshnikov/American Ballet Theatre "Nutcracker" still seen on 
videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 Vainonen's choreography is much admired in Russia for reasons hard to fathom 
when watching this performance. Yes, the Kirov is a magnificent classical 
ensemble -- but for half its length, "The Nutcracker" focuses on party games 
and mice-on-the-march, requiring greater dramatic conviction than the cast can 
muster. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, when classical dancing finally becomes dominant, the conducting of 
Victor Fedotov proves ruinous: slowing the music down until it's impossible for 
even Kirov dancers to sustain a sense of flow or spontaneity. Staged in 
18th-Century style (as usual for Soviet-era versions), the Waltz of the Flowers 
emerges static and limp, while the Arabian Dance threatens to come to a 
complete stop more than once. 
</P>
<P>
 Lezhnina brings her usual delicacy and refinement to the role of Masha and 
Baranov dances with exemplary smoothness and lightness as the Nutcracker 
Prince. But, starting with Piotr Russanov's prosaic Drosselmeyer, this is a 
very routine performance. 
</P>
<P>
 With a few discreet exceptions, director Yvon Gerault keeps the camera far 
back and avoids video effects. This, then, is a souvenir of how the ballet 
looks on stage -- except that the Epilogue is different from the one in the 
1992 American premiere in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, Masha awoke from her dream still wearing her tutu, but she now 
appears in a shapeless nightdress. Makes more sense, but listen to the music. 
Does it tell you her dream is over? Of course not, and a sensible "Nutcracker" 
is no "Nutcracker" at all. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Kirov Ballet "Nutcracker" screens at 5 and 10 tonight on Bravo cable.

 Moviegoing usually takes a back seat to last-minute shopping during the 
pre-Christmas week and 1994 was no exception. Still, New Line's decision to 
shell out $7 million for Jim Carrey panned out as "Dumb and Dumber" devastated 
the opposition and "The Santa Clause" broke the $100-million mark in its sixth 
week of release.MGM's "Speechless," starring Geena Davis and Michael Keaton, 
had a disappointing bow, while the limited releases of Fox's "Nell" and 
Columbia's Beethoven saga "Immortal Beloved" were more encouraging.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; DUKE EASILY KEEPS NON-CONFERENCE STREAK ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Another night in Cameron Indoor Stadium, one more victim for No. 9 Duke. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherokee Parks scored 19 points to lead five players in double figures as the 
Blue Devils ran their non-conference homecourt winning streak to 93 games with 
a 99-56 victory over North Carolina A&T Monday night in Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Blue Devils have won 81 of their last 86 games in Cameron 
Indoor Stadium, and they raised their non-conference record over the last 10 
years to 175-18 in playing their first game after the break for final exams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were focused for the ballgame, and after exams and before the break, I 
think that says a lot for the kids on our team," Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke (6-1) made 68.5 percent of its field goals, but also committed 24 
turnovers. A&T finished 18 for 68 (26.5 percent). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No. 14 Syracuse 103, Robert Morris 67 -- Otis Hill and Lazarus Sims led a 20-4 
run late in the first half as the Orangemen (6-1) defeated the Colonials (2-3) 
in Syracuse, N.Y., for their sixth victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 John Wallace had 16 points and was one of six players in double figures for 
Syracuse, which surpassed 100 points for the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Syracuse went to a full-court trap less than a minute into the game and forced 
Robert Morris into 16 turnovers while holding the smaller Colonials to 31 
percent shooting (seven for 22) en route to a 48-30 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No. 18 Georgia Tech 94, Furman 73 -- Drew Barry scored 25 points and grabbed 
11 rebounds as the No. 18 Yellow Jackets (7-1) pulled away early in the second 
half against Furman (2-5) in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Tech, coming off its first loss Saturday night against Louisville, saw 
its 43-39 halftime lead cut to one point when Furman's Chuck Vincent made a 
three-point play to open the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yellow Jackets then scored 10 consecutive points, with Barry and Travis 
Best making three-point shots, to go ahead for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Sexton led Mercer with 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
 *

97-71 victory in Washington. Brevin Knight added 17 points and David Harbour 
and Tim Young 14 points each for Stanford. . . . Erwin Claggett made five of 
eight three-point shots and scored 24 points in 23 minutes as Saint Louis (7-0) 
rolled to a 93-69 victory over Southern Methodist (1-5) in St. Louis. . . . 
Unbeaten Oklahoma rolled to its seventh consecutive victory, getting 28 points

NORTHRIDGE OUTCLASSED IN CINCINNATI, 116-54; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: NO. 13 
BEARCATS JUMP OUT TO BIG LEAD, FORCE 30 TURNOVERS AGAINST MATADORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Cal State Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy said that shooting at least 50% 
was a goal each game, he did not mean to imply that getting a shot off every 
other possession would suffice. 
</P>
<P>
 Against a swarming, trapping Cincinnati defense Monday night, the Northridge 
men's basketball team struggled merely to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati forced 30 turnovers resulting in 42 Bearcat points to deal 
Northridge its second-most lopsided loss in school history, 116-54, in a 
nonconference basketball game before a near-sellout crowd of 12,819 in 
Shoemaker Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (2-4) took only 44 shots -- 30 fewer than Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13th-ranked Bearcats (7-2) made the most of a final tuneup before playing 
host to undefeated and 24th-ranked California on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 They scored 65 points in the first half, the most in school history; they 
scored the most points in a game since December 1976, when they had 122 against 
St. Joseph's (Ind.); and they won by the largest margin since defeating Wright 
State by 68 -- also in December '76. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it was good for the players, but it was good for me. I had 
fun," said Cincinnati Coach Bob Huggins, whose team had won its previous two 
games in the final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cassidy: "They came after us like a boxer in a ring. They hit us with a 
one-two punch." 
</P>
<P>
 And delivered an early knockout. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati opened a 21-5 lead in the first 6 1/2 minutes. The Bearcats scored 
their 55th and 56th points -- enough to win -- on a pair of free throws by 
LaZelle Durden with 2:03 remaining in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Durden, a senior guard, and freshman forward Danny Fortson each scored 24 
points to lead the Bearcats. Center Art Long added 15, including 10 in the 
first five minutes on four dunks and a rebound tip. 
</P>
<P>
 Noted for their long-range shooting skills, the Bearcats made only four of 13 
from three-point range in the first half. They still led, 65-29. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaches told us to get after them early, to force them to make mistakes 
and not let them get confident," Fortson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission accomplished. Northridge, panicked by the Bearcats' full-court press, 
averaged a turnover per minute for most of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just not a great ball-handling team, which was evident," Cassidy said. 
"We went away from our whole game plan. . . . Panic does that." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Dorsey had 15 points and Ruben Oronoz 11 for Northridge. Center Peter 
Micelli, who came in averaging a team-high 12.4 points, made only one field 
goal and was held to six points. The Matadors were outrebounded, 45-24. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst loss in Northridge history took place in the very first game played 
by what was then known as San Fernando Valley State, in 1958. The Matadors lost 
to Chapman College, 110-45. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy played guard on that team.

MORNING BRIEFING: BOBBY BOWDEN APPARENTLY NOT THE RIGHT KIND OF SANTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A less-than-jolly Santa Claus at a Jacksonville, Fla., mall told a 6-year-old 
boy and his brother they wouldn't get any presents if they were University of 
Florida football fans. 
</P>
<P>
 When Santa saw the children's mother wearing a Gator sweat shirt, he said, 
"Santa Claus doesn't like Gator fans. . . . Santa Claus wishes that Florida 
State would beat the Gators in the Sugar Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 When she told Santa he was being rude, the red-faced chief elf retorted: 
"Lady, if you don't like it, you can get (the children) off (his lap)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Santa: The boys' father, who was videotaping the visit, told Santa he 
didn't like his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa jumped from his chair and allegedly thumped the father's chest with his 
finger and said, "You want to do something about it, right now, pal? Right here 
on stage?" 
</P>

Winter Olympics, will skate Friday on a suburban Portland rink dressed as the

 Tough sell: Charger radio commentator Jim Laslavic, on the crowd of 48,152 at 
the Meadowlands for Sunday's game against the Jets: "These fans are so 
disinterested in this game they can't even muster up a good boo."

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: VEGAS TOURNAMENT ISN'T STRIPPED DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Eric Shepard 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Conducting a national-caliber boys' basketball tournament these days takes 
plenty of time and a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the Las Vegas Holiday Prep Classic, which started in 1977 with 16 
local teams. This year, the four-day tournament, which started Monday, has a 
record 50 teams from 10 states, the District of Columbia and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 The impressive lineup includes Oak Hill Academy of Mouth of Wilson, Va.; 
Dunbar of Washington, D.C.; East Anchorage and Mt. Zion Christian Academy of 
Durham, N.C., among others. Top Southern California entries include Santa Ana 
Mater Dei, Compton Dominguez, Inglewood and Westchester, the defending 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry McKay, the tournament's founder and director, started setting the field 
last January and had it completed by March. He rejected more than 20 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting teams such as Oak Hill, Dunbar and Mater Dei is not easy. These 
schools receive requests from dozens of other holiday tournaments. To get them, 
McKay had to pick up all their expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 It will cost $140,000 to put on the tournament. Corporate sponsorship and 
ticket sales supply most of the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament, which concludes with the championship game Thursday night at 
8:30, was moved from Nevada Las Vegas to Durango High last year. Durango is a 
new school with two gymnasiums. McKay is an assistant principal there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tournament has become a year-round job," said McKay, who is also a 
college basketball referee. "But I'm a bit of a junkie, so I love it. I think 
we're putting on a pretty good show." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore standout basketball player Schea Cotton of Mater Dei was suspended 
for one game last Friday for verbally abusing and bumping an official during a 
tournament game against Huntington Beach Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third quarter of the semifinal game in the Tournament of Champions, 
Cotton was knocked to the floor by Ocean View's Erik Petersen. Cotton got up 
and went after referee Mark Wexler, yelling and bumping him with his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton was immediately ejected, and under Southern Section rules his 
suspension was automatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was ejected for the abusive language, not the contact," Wexler said. "I 
don't think the contact was intentional." 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei went on to win the game, 77-46. Without Cotton, the Monarchs 
defeated Tustin in the championship game Saturday night, 55-46. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton, an all-state forward as a freshman, will play this week as Mater Dei 
(6-0) competes in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The City Section will get two automatic berths each for boys and girls in the 
state tournament this season. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last three years, the City's only automatic berth was reserved for the 
Division 4-A champions. The Southern Section, by contrast, gets four automatic 
berths each for boys and girls in the eight-team brackets. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Section has dominated the boys' tournament, having won eight Division 
I titles since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mathematically, it didn't make sense the way it was written before, with the 
number of schools we had and how successful the City has been at the state 
level," said Barbara Fiege, section commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiege said only 4-A teams will be considered for the two berths, with the 
champion and either the runner-up or a semifinalist being selected. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei has the best high school football team in the nation, according to 
one publication. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs, who upset previously undefeated La Puente Bishop Amat, 28-21, 
for the Southern Section Division I championship on Dec. 10, are ranked No. 1 
in USA Today's final poll released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 They became the mythical national champions when Miami Southridge, ranked No. 
1 last week, lost to Pensacola Washington in Florida's 6A final Saturday, 16-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei (14-0) made its debut in the poll at No. 15 three weeks ago after 
defeating then-No. 8 Los Alamitos in the semifinals. It moved up to No. 2 when 
it upset Bishop Amat. 
</P>
<P>
 USA Today started its top-25 poll 13 years ago and no California school had 
previously finished No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Football letter of intent day is still two months away, but several local 
players have already chosen their colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Melsby of Los Alamitos, Orange County's all-time leading receiver, said 
he plans to sign with UCLA in February. Lineman Kris Farris of Rancho Santa 
Margarita also said he would sign with the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona receiver Darrin Chiaverini chose Colorado, and Etiwanda defensive 
lineman Sharcus Steen plans to attend Stanford. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Seaton, a standout basketball player at Anaheim Servite, will be 
sidelined for at least eight weeks after breaking a bone in his left foot in a 
game against Nogales last Saturday. Seaton, a 6-foot-9 center who has already 
signed with Stanford, is averaging 17 points and eight rebounds. . . . Misty 
May of Newport Harbor was selected the Mizuno volleyball player of the year. 
The senior plans to attend Long Beach State.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raiders are driving me crazy. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Here it is, the last week of the regular season, and I still can't figure out 
if they are a team of destiny or a team destined not to make the playoffs. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 Their record is 9-6. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 They would be 11-4 if they had won games against Miami and San Diego that were 
within their grasp. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 They would be 7-8 if they had lost games against Seattle and Houston that they 
survived after game-winning and game-tying field-goal attempts missed by a 
whisker and less. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line is that, after winning five of their last six, they still need 
a victory over Kansas City on Saturday at the Coliseum or a New England loss at 
Chicago to reach the playoffs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The optimist in me says they'll beat the Chiefs, who usually beat them, 
because Jeff Hostetler is throwing strikes again, Chester McGlockton is 
clogging the middle better than anyone including Cortez Kennedy and the Jeffs 
(Jaeger and Gossett) are kicking well. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The pessimist in me says they'll lose to Kansas City because of penalties, 
other fundamental mistakes, questionable strategy, and the fact they will be 
facing Joe Montana instead of Dan McGwire or Hugh Millen. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It was strange to hear a commentator, ESPN's Joe Theismann, criticize the 
Raiders for not throwing enough bombs. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 McGlockton's quickness at a listed 310 pounds is remarkable. . . .  
</P>
<P>

<P>
 How important is home-field advantage in the playoffs? Since the NFL-AFL 
merger in 1970, home teams have won 68.9% of all postseason games.Of course, 
you have to factor in that the home teams are those with the better records. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 It's looking less and less likely that the Miami Dolphins will become the 
first team to have a home-field advantage in the Super Bowl. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If the Raiders are guilty of committing too many penalties, often the Rams are 
guilty of not committing enough. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Only one penalty was assessed against them Sunday at Soldier Field, an 
indicator of their timidity. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Rams would be wise to draft J.J. Stokes, who might become the best wide 
receiver outside San Francisco. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If Raider wide receiver Alexander Wright really ran 40 yards in 4.14, as Mike 
Patrick said on the telecast Sunday, he is the fastest person ever. Bob Hayes 
says he never ran the 40 faster than 4.3. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, NFL people have been exaggerating 40-yard times, or misclocking 
them, for years. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to understand why Brown owner Art Modell is asking for a new 
football stadium to be built in Cleveland. If you think the Coliseum is a lousy 
place to watch an NFL game, try Municipal Stadium some Sunday afternoon. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco 49ers, who are third on the all-time list, will have to 
score 51 points next Monday night at Minnesota to break the NFL record of 541 
in a season set by the Washington Redskins in 1983. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a weakness in Ernie Els' golf game, the rest of the tour would 
like to know about it. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Afternoon Deelites looked awesome winning the $500,000 Hollywood Futurity by 6 
1/2 lengths on Sunday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Before handing the Kentucky Derby to him, though, consider that Afternoon 
Deelites' sire, Private Terms, was unbeaten in seven races before the 1988 
Derby. On the first Saturday in May that year, he finished ninth behind Winning 
Colors. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The freshman basketball crop from the state of California is formidable. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, this squad could hold its own against freshmen from high schools in 
any other state: Ricky Price, Duke; Jelani Gardner and Tremaine Fowlkes, 
California; J.R. Henderson and Toby Bailey, UCLA; Cameron Murray, USC; Tim 
Young, Stanford; Jeremy Veal, Arizona State, and Miles Simon, Arizona. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 USC ought to handle Missouri Kansas City tonight at the Sports Arena. After 
all, the Trojans won last year on the Kangaroo court. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Mavericks (11-8) are within two victories of matching their total 
for the 1993-94 season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 So much for those who criticized the Orlando Magic for winding up with 
Anfernee Hardaway instead of Chris Webber. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Hey, let's look at the bright side -- violence is down in the NHL this year.

SMITH PULLS HAMSTRING IN COWBOY VICTORY; PRO FOOTBALL: RUNNING BACK SAYS INJURY 
ISN'T SERIOUS, BUT DALLAS DOESN'T WANT TO TAKE CHANCES. SAINTS ELIMINATED, 
24-16. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a game that meant virtually nothing, the Dallas Cowboys nearly lost 
everything Monday night when Emmitt Smith was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, the league's leading scorer and the key to the Super Bowl champions' 
running game, went down in the third quarter of a 24-16 victory over the New 
Orleans Saints because of a pulled left hamstring. He was helped to the 
sideline, unable to put weight on the leg, then was taken off on a cart. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, Smith made it clear the injury wasn't too serious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just worried about staying healthy and getting ready for the playoffs," 
said Smith, the league's leading rusher the last three years and the 1993 most 
valuable player of the regular season and Super Bowl. "I'm preparing myself 
mentally to play in the game Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Barry Switzer sounded like that won't happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Emmitt thinks he'll be back this week, but obviously we're not going to even 
consider that," Switzer said of the season finale at the New York Giants. "The 
doctors don't think it's severe, but time will tell us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys don't need to use Smith on Saturday, then they will get a 
first-round bye in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The injury overshadowed a methodical victory for Dallas (12-3), which already 
has clinched the NFC East title and the second spot in the conference playoffs 
behind San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was nothing more than a nationally televised workout for the Cowboys 
that almost turned disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss erased what little chance the Saints (6-9) had of making the 
playoffs. They were victimized by two passes that Dallas returned for 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 New Orleans had a chance to tie, however, when Dallas' running game 
disappeared without Smith. Derek Brown scored on a four-yard run with 5:37 
remaining and the Saints got the ball back moments later. But linebacker Darrin 
Smith got his second interception of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two interceptions for touchdowns obviously were big plays," Saint Coach 
Jim Mora said. "I thought we moved the ball pretty well against these guys, we 
only punted one time, but we had a tough time in the red zone. We couldn't get 
touchdowns in the red zone and that hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 After a sloppy first half, the Cowboys got serious with a masterful 8 
1/2-minute drive to open the third quarter. Smith scored from the one, 
completing a 74-yard, 16-play march with his 22nd touchdown of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the fourth quarter, Darrin Smith caught a ball tipped by Brown 
at the New Orleans 13 and ran it in, his first career interception and first 
pro touchdown. That matched the earlier 54-yard effort by end Tony Tolbert on a 
poorly thrown pass by Jim Everett. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the ball coming, I just cut," Darrin Smith said. "I didn't even have 
time to think about it. It felt great." 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints moved smartly on the opening series to the Cowboys' 41. Then 
Tolbert, sensing a screen pass, dropped into coverage and Everett threw 
directly to him. Tolbert lumbered down the left sideline, got a block at the 10 
and eased into the end zone for his first career touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Bates' 40-yard run on New Orleans' next possession was the Saints' 
longest this season, as well as the longest against Dallas. It was wasted, 
however, when Morten Andersen missed a 40-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was New Orleans' turn for a big interception return. Wayne Martin 
tipped Troy Aikman's pass at the Saints' 32 and Darion Conner grabbed it. The 
linebacker sped down the same sideline Darrin Smith and Tolbert traversed. But 
he was run down by, of all people, 330-pound rookie tackle Larry Allen at the 
15. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I must have been a little winded and he just kept running," Conner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 That saved Dallas four points when the Saints couldn't get into the end zone, 
instead settling for Andersen's 21-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we made too many mistakes to beat these guys," Mora said. "You can't 
give them things. You can't help them."

 ...Miami Dolphin quarterback Dan Marino is worried he might need a second 
operation to repair his right Achilles' tendon, which hasn't completely healed 
since he first underwent surgery in October 1993. "Most of the time it's not 
noticeable in the way I play, but I feel a difference," he told the Miami 
Herald.

COLLEGE DIVISION / ARA NAJARIAN; RIVERSIDE LOSES PLAYERS BUT WINS GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's only eight games into the season, but the UC Riverside men's basketball 
team is already having surprising success. 
</P>
<P>
 Having eight new players figured to be a challenge for Coach John Masi. 
Replacing Bob Fife, last year's California Collegiate Athletic Assn. player of 
the year, figured to be impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were still a couple of wrinkles Masi didn't figure on heading into 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 One, was Chris Jackson leaving to play football.  
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who was a reserve guard last year, decided to quit after last season 
and pursue football. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not much you can do about that," Masi said. "He felt he wanted play 
Division I, and that he could in football. His twin brother (Ray) plays for 
Washington State, so he felt he could." 
</P>
<P>
 As a sophomore last year, Jackson averaged 14 minutes and 3.2 points off the 
bench. Perhaps his best moment was in a victory over two-time national champion 
Cal State Bakersfield, when his late free throws helped ice the game. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a good chance that he would have been a starter because the job was 
open after Marcellus Smith graduated.  
</P>
<P>
 But Jackson wanted to play football, so he transferred to Orange Coast College 
in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 As a receiver there, he caught 37 passes for 743 yards -- that's 20 yards a 
catch -- and nine touchdowns. He set Orange Coast records by catching a 67-yard 
touchdown pass and by catching three touchdown passes in one game. He planned 
on playing basketball there as well, but he has not completed enough units to 
be eligible until January. 
</P>
<P>
 The other wrinkle Masi didn't figure on was losing Darryle Flicking, a 
transfer guard from Riverside Community College.  
</P>
<P>
 Flicking set a state junior college record by scoring 1,991 points in his two 
seasons, and he averaged more than 29 points a game. Most reports were that he 
was good enough to play Division I basketball, so it was a nice bit of 
recruiting by Masi to keep Flicking in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Highlanders' first game of the season, Flicking scored 36 points in an 
easy victory over Cal Baptist. However, Masi was disappointed with Flicking's 
shot selection -- he made half of his 28 shots -- and that was the beginning of 
the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Flicking quit the team in hopes of getting a release to transfer to another 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written statement, Flicking said he and Masi disagreed about his role on 
the team and that he was hoping to redshirt this season and transfer. Masi 
agreed that Flicking had different ideas about his role on the team and has 
agreed to let Flicking transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 Masi now uses eight players for nearly equal minutes, and the team has a 6-2 
record. No player on his team has cracked the conference top 10 in scoring and 
Boo Purdom, a small forward, leads the team in assists.  
</P>
<P>
 "With eight new players, and trying to play nine or 10 players, we have to be 
somewhat interchangeable," Masi said. "We unquestionably have more good 
athletes to do so. But we need to be consistent." 
</P>

<P>
 It took awhile, but Claremont-Mudd has become the latest Southland football 
program to change coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 John Zinda, 55, who has been the Claremont-Mudd coach for 27 years, officially 
stepped down so that his assistant, Rick Candaele, could take over. Zinda will 
continue as athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
 Zinda had served the longest of any coach in any division among four-year 
colleges in California. His record is 93-131-4.  
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Claremont-Mudd's football program was in jeopardy of being 
discontinued. Dwindling numbers of players and victories caused the Board of 
Trustees to call a meeting to examine the viability of the program. At one 
point the team had gone winless for 25 games and had only 27 players. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of the meeting was to increase funds and the size of the coaching 
staff to help turn things around. 
</P>
<P>
 Candaele, who was the head coach at UC Santa Barbara before that program was 
discontinued, was brought in as an offensive coordinator with the idea that he 
would eventually become the head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 His impact was immediate, but even more evident last season as the Stags were 
ranked third in the NCAA Division III passing offense (308.2 yards per game). 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't really a coaching change, but a transition," Zinda said. "We 
planned this move for the past two years. Everybody -- the players, the 
coaches, administration, parents -- has known about the process and has worked 
to make it a smooth transition, which it has been."

 Vic Shealy has been named football coach at Azusa Pacific. It is the first 
head coaching job for Shealy, 33, who previously was defensive coordinator at 
Austin Peay. He succeeds the retiring Jim Milhon. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Poly Pomona's men's basketball team is off to a 7-1 start, the best in 
school history. The previous best was 6-2 in 1963. . . . Pacific Christian 
College (9-6) is the nation's top-ranked team in the National Christian 
Colleges Athletic Assn.  
</P>
<P>
 Several Southland football players were honored by the Don Hanson National 
Weekly Gazette, one of the few national publications that honors NCAA Division 
II and III programs. Sophomore wide receiver Mike Cook, who set records at 
Claremont-Mudd by catching 70 passes for 1,014 yards, Gary Giannoni, a senior 
defensive back for Redlands, and Tomek Mikler, a junior punter for Redlands, 
were named to the All-West Region first team. Senior quarterback John Shipp, 
who set a Claremont-Mudd record with 2,871 yards of total offense, was named to 
the second team. Shipp was the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic 
Conference's offensive player of the year, and Cook was an SCIAC first-team 
selection. Other Southland selections to the second team were offensive lineman 
Kelly Akridge and kicker Bill Hamlin of Chapman, and defensive lineman Mike 
Weiland and linebacker Brett Wixom of Redlands.

 House of Fabrics Lists Pretax Charges: The Sherman Oaks-based fabrics and 
crafts retailer said it had costs of as much as $69 million in the third 
quarter because of store closings and deep discounts on its inventory.House of 
Fabrics Inc., which recently sought Chapter 11 protection from creditors in 
Bankruptcy Court, said it will take pretax charges of up to $50 million to 
cover the cost of closing more than 200 stores, and a $19-million pretax loss 
provision because of steep markdowns. The company didn't say what the after-tax 
effect on third-quarter earnings would be. Sales for the quarter ended Oct. 31 
fell 36% to $90.6 million.

'GOTTA HAVE IT!': A FINE AMASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now, here's a show the whole family will love. Really. It's about the 
collector's special itch, the passion to own every last "Brady Bunch" 
merchandising tie-in or to corner the market on early pocket calculators. 
</P>
<P>
 The secret of "Gotta Have It! The Nature of Collecting," at the Fullerton 
Museum Center through Feb. 19, is the emphasis on the human quirkiness behind 
the sheer agglomeration of objects. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanying selected items from 16 private hoards are printed and videotaped 
interviews with the collectors, explaining how they got started and what 
intrigues them about their chosen field. 
</P>
<P>
 Chosen by museum staff from responses to a public request for information on 
unusual local hoardings, the collectors range from a 10-year-old insect 
enthusiast, who caught the "bug" at a Cub Scout meeting, to a retired U.S. 
Marine Corps major, whose passion for war memorabilia reflects a belief in 
learning from tragic mistakes of the past, no matter whether they were made by 
the victors or the losers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the collectors started out accidentally or casually with one object, 
then began lusting after every example of it, at swap meets, garage sales or 
antique shops. Nuance tends to comes later, when the thrill of the hunt is 
channeled into "mint" items, or particularly rare pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly why collectors create this mission for themselves generally seems to 
be as much a mystery to them as it may be to those of us who don't collect 
anything except dust bunnies or parking tickets. Catalogue essayist (and The 
Times' "Fixations" columnist) Jim Washburn writes that collecting "allows the 
collectors little worlds they can master, where they can possess or know all 
that there is." 
</P>
<P>
 As it happens, no local collections of modern or contemporary art are included 
in the show. Yet art collectors certainly understand the emotional attachment 
for objects and the pursuit of rarefied details about these treasures. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas art has a long, exhaustively studied and interpreted history that 
takes years to learn, a collector of objects like pencil sharpeners or Coke 
posters can become an "expert" overnight. Even more alluring, some pop 
artifacts allow anyone who spent bored childhood afternoons in front of a TV to 
be walking encyclopedias of relevant lore. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the home-grown influence of the entertainment industry and the dearth of 
significant high-culture collections in Southern California, it probably isn't 
surprising that commercial objects are frequently the collectible of choice. 
Edie Bonk, for example, collects images of Bozo the Clown, a character who 
began as a voice for Capitol Records in the '30s and later became the popular 
kiddie TV show host. 
</P>
<P>
 With their red or (faded) carrot-colored hair, U-shaped grins and red noses, 
the Bozos -- dolls, puppets, games, books, records, masks, telephones, bubble 
gum machines and so forth -- are a garishly cheery lot. And that's why Bonk 
collects them. Commercial or not, Bozo was her favorite clown as a child ("the 
happiest, silliest, friendliest one of them all," as she says in a gallery 
note). 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to the comfort zones of one's childhood seems to be a major theme of 
adult collectors. Chris Butler, who collects Lucille Ball memorabilia 
(including "I Love Lucy" episodes, two of which play continuously in the 
gallery), fell in love with the comedienne as a shy boy who was awed by her 
ability to get in and out of awkward situations. 
</P>
<P>
 As an adult, Butler prizes the show because, he says, it's about "love and 
relationship" -- commodities as perfectly preserved in the miniature, 24-minute 
world of TV comedy as they are vulnerable in real life. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Davis and Bill Morgan are aficionados of TV memorabilia from the '70s. 
That's when the world of merchandising tie-ins was growing exponentially beyond 
theme lunch boxes and board games. Their examples include a Buffy (from "Family 
Affair") Makeup and Hair-styling Set to a replica of "The Love Boat." Even the 
men's admitted zest for competing with their friends to get hot pieces is a 
throwback to schoolboy behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other groups of objects in the show reflect the collector's cultural heritage 
(Alma Rail's Native American artifacts), foreign travel (living in Saudi Arabia 
prompted Linda Scoggin's interest in camels), or fascination with history, the 
natural world or the laws of science. 
</P>
<P>
 Some years ago, retired Marine Corps Maj. William Mimiaga sold his G.I. Joe 
collection and turned his attention to the flesh-and-blood arena of war. 
Chilling links to sites of unimaginable suffering are found in his collection 
of mundane objects from Nazi concentration camps, including an inmate's striped 
uniform and cap, and a group of colored felt triangles distinguishing Jews, 
homosexuals and other "undesirables" from one another. 
</P>
<P>
 An adjacent case holds three colorful Bosnian Muslim fezzes from World War II 
that bear appliques of the Nazi eagle-and-swastika emblem and a death's head: 
reminders of ethnic hatreds that long predated the current conflict in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lighter vein, presidential campaign buttons from Dennis Doran's 
collection show how a cheap, portable form of partisan publicity dating from 
1896 has been pumped full of steroids (hubcap-sized Bush-Quayle buttons) and 
injected with increasing doses of attack-mode campaigning (from the tart humor 
of an Adlai Stevenson button showing Harry Truman silenced with a pacifier to a 
picture of a screw above the words Ronald Reagan ). 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is another kind of collection, consisting of ordinary objects 
that create their own weird ambience when allowed to multiply, like Roger 
Ellison's blinding array of rubber ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 Row upon row of small yellow and orange creatures -- pouting, sneering, 
performing, snoozing, piloting, driving -- create a retinal overload of 
high-keyed color, a Silly Symphony of arbitrarily selected human activities 
juxtaposed and duplicated to the point of utter ridiculousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Such are the curious joys of knowing you just gotta have it. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Gotta Have It! The Nature of Collecting" continues through Feb. 19 at the 
Fullerton Museum Center, 301 N. Pomona Ave., Fullerton. Hours: noon to 4 p.m., 
Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday; noon to 8 p.m. Thursdays. $2.50

TAKING THEIR ACT TO CYBERSPACE; REVIEW: ACTORS SUCH AS DENNIS HOPPER AND BRIAN 
KEITH ARE BEING USED ON CD-ROM GAMES. JUST HOW THEY WILL AFFECT SALES REMAINS 
TO BE SEEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The splashy magazine ads that began appearing this summer for the CD-ROM game 
Hell: A Cyberpunk Thriller did not mention the usual selling points for these 
games -- combat, challenging puzzles, technical wizardry. 
</P>
<P>
 The creators of the game, which hit stores last week after nearly a two-month 
delay, felt they had built these important attributes into their product. But 
so had creators of dozens of games being rushed into production for this year's 
holiday shopping season, the first with CD-ROMs taking a significant role. 
</P>
<P>
 Hell: A Cyberpunk Thriller had something no other CD-ROM could claim: a movie 
star. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a star of the ascendancy of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Julia Roberts, but 
nonetheless a highly recognizable, name-above-the-title performer -- Dennis 
Hopper. Joining him in the cast (and ads) for the "cyberpunk thriller" are 
Grace Jones, Geoffrey Holder and model Stephanie Seymour. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first CD-ROM to feature well-known actors. Patrick Stewart of 
"Star Trek" fame is the on-screen host of the new version of Compton's CD-ROM 
encyclopedia, while his crewmate Jonathan Frakes and Morgan Fairchild are 
featured as celebrity players in a CD-ROM poker game disc. 
</P>
<P>
 But hiring actors to play dramatic roles on CD-ROM games is a new wrinkle in 
this fledgling field. Preceding Hell: A Cyberpunk Thriller in the market by a 
few weeks was Under the Killing Moon, a detective adventure that features 
actors Brian Keith, Margot Kidder, Russell Means and the off-screen voice of 
James Earl Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Until these two games, casting for live-action sequences in CD-ROMs was 
analogous to the early days of silent films when anyone who happened to be in 
the vicinity of the camera was recruited to play a part. The now-famous Miller 
Brothers, who created the hugely successful Myst CD-ROM, play all the roles on 
that disc's live-action sequences. The pilots in the popular CD-ROM Rebel 
Assault game were staff artists at LucasArts, and the actors in the haunted 
mansion of the 7th Guest were recruited by the Oregon-based creators of the 
game at a local Shakespeare festival. 
</P>
<P>
 It was inevitable that with the rise in popularity and budgets for CD-ROMs, 
better-known actors would be included for marketing purposes, if nothing else. 
Hell: A Cyberpunk Thriller will provide a particularly good litmus test of how 
much a celebrity name will contribute to the success of a CD-ROM. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because as a game, Hell: A Cyberpunk Thriller is simply awful. 
</P>
<P>
 The eagerly awaited game is set in Washington, D.C., in the year 2095, when, 
according to the included booklet, the capital has become "the place where Hell 
meets Earth." (Supply your own wisecrack here.) The United States still exists, 
but is ruled by a repressive political party known as the Hand of God (led by a 
character played by Grace Jones), which has the power to condemn citizens to 
Hades. 
</P>
<P>
 The game (in MS-DOS platform, with Mac coming) concerns two Hand of God police 
officers, Gideon and Rachel, who suddenly, and for reasons unknown to them, 
become targets of the political regime. On the run from their former 
colleagues, they have to solve numerous puzzles and fight a variety of 
opponents both in hell and on Earth in order to survive. One of the major 
heavies they meet along the way is Mr. Beautiful, played by Hopper. Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 Although you wouldn't know it by the ads, Hopper is never actually on screen. 
He only supplied a voice for a character who is played, like almost everyone in 
the game, by a computer-animated action figure who moves about in jerky, highly 
repetitive motions. Although a lot of technical prowess obviously went into the 
rendering of these characters, the overall effect is like watching a low-budget 
production of "Gumby Goes to Hell." 
</P>
<P>
 The puzzles that must be solved to enable Gideon and Rachel to progress are 
challenging, but it takes far too many long, static dialogue scenes to get to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The humor is juvenile and the personal interactions between the characters are 
trite. (Rachel and a former girlfriend of Gideon played by Seymour continually 
fight over the guy, although he doesn't seem so much a prize, anyway.) 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Killing Moon (MS-DOS only) is far more imaginative, both technically 
and in its storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
 Spread over four CD-ROM discs, this game is also set in a dismal future and is 
also a mystery. A down-on-his-luck detective, played by the game's director, 
Chris Jones, starts investigating what seems to be a simple robbery and 
stumbles upon an evil conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 On these discs, the celebrities are used to full advantage, with Keith 
especially seeming to have a good time in his small role as a grumpy, 
about-to-retire private investigator. The game itself -- while neither as 
satisfying as Myst nor addictive as the fast-action Doom -- is intriguing and 
the freedom of movement it allows around a cityscape (it's supposed to be San 
Francisco in 2042) as you look for clues is astonishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sticking a few name actors into a CD-ROM might get a game a bit of extra 
notice, but in a medium far more expensive for the consumer than heading out to 
the movies (Hell: A Cyberpunk Thriller retails for about $45, Under a Killing 
Moon costs about $60) the game-play is far more important.

COLUMN LEFT/ JONATHAN FREEDMAN: COAL FOR THE POOR, TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH; 
CHRISTMAS '94 IS DAMPENED BY A MOOD OF MEANNESS, OF TRIUMPHAL GRINCH 
CONSERVATISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN FREEDMAN, Jonathan Freedman is the author of From Cradle to Grave: 
the Human Face of Poverty in America (Atheneum, 1993). He won the 1987 Pulitzer 
Prize for editorials on immigration and amnesty. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 'Twas the election before Christmas, and all through the House, not a liberal 
was stirring, not even a mouse. While the Clintons tossed in their beds, 
dreaming of Whitewater, who should appear in the Capitol but the Grinch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a mandate from the American people," quoth the Grinch, waving a 
10-point Christmas list he called a "contract with America." 
</P>
<P>
 In the stockings of the rich, he slipped a tax cut. In the stockings of poor 
children, he stuffed lumps of coal. 
</P>
<P>
 The stand-in St. Nick, a former history professor, then proceeded to lecture 
on the virtues of Grinch Republicanism. In the world according to Newt, Scrooge 
would be pilloried as a Benedict Arnold for betraying the rich. Tiny Tim would 
be dispatched to an orphanage. And baby Jesus wouldn't qualify for welfare 
because his teen-age mother couldn't document his paternity.  
</P>
<P>
 The spirit of Christmas '94 is dampened by a mood of meanness, of triumphal 
Grinchism, across the land. And here in California it has gone one step further 
with the passage of a popular edict that would deny an undocumented immigrant 
Maria a manger in which to give birth. 
</P>
<P>
 Grinch conservatism is based on the radical notion that punishing the poor 
will prod them to do what is right. Right, of course, is defined by economic 
interests -- that is, those with money. Fear is the means by which the powerful 
motivate the powerless to act in the interests of the rich. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Grinch economics, market incentives induce people to consume; tax 
incentives motivate them to produce. If we want poor people to stop 
reproducing, provide a disincentive to government dependency -- cut off 
welfare, in other words. Replacing welfare with orphanages combines the carrot 
of market incentives with the stick of fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly enough, conservatives say they believe in freedom and oppose 
tyranny. But incentives are just authoritarianism at a discount. Saving money 
is a new and improved method of saving souls. Grinch Republicans are selling 
tax breaks the way corrupt priests once sold indulgences to guarantee passage 
to heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next five years, the "contract with America" would grab at least $40 
billion from the plates of the poorest Americans, from children to the disabled 
and elderly -- and dole out billions more, in the form of tax benefits, to 
stock market investors. It would eliminate all forms of assistance for legal 
immigrants and give the states this money to build orphanages, adoption centers 
and group homes.  
</P>
<P>
 Not to be outdone, President Clinton has offered middle-class Americans a 
$60-billion tax cut. Sounds like a lot of money, but it comes down to a 
$500-per-child tax credit for families earning up to $75,000. At Toys R Us, 
$500 gets you an Atari Jaguar and a Barbie Jeep.  
</P>
<P>
 The Santacrats hope to spur the economy -- and boost Clinton's popularity -- 
by giving middle-class Americans some tax relief. (And Republicans have 
promised a $500-per-child tax credit for families with incomes up to $200,000.) 
But, except for California, the U.S. economy is already booming, and the 
Federal Reserve is busy raising interest rates to brake economic growth. 
Middle-class homeowners with flexible-rate mortgages, and the citizens of 
hapless Orange County (which loses $300 million each time interest rates rise 
one point), would certainly prefer low interest rates to a trivial tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
 In the complex budget battle ahead, Americans face rather simple choices: Will 
investment Scrooges send today's Tiny Tims to orphanages in order to lower 
their capital gains tax? Are middle-class parents ready to sacrifice poor 
children for a Barbie Jeep? Is a tax cut worth saddling our children with a 
deficit of more than $200 billion?  
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to blame politicians for heartless deeds. But it's disturbing to 
admit that the Grinch is in our hearts -- a reflection of what we have become. 
</P>
<P>
 The literature of Christmas, from Charles Dickens to Dr. Seuss, is a timeless 
reminder of the temptation of greed and the urgency of need. 'Tis the season to 
rekindle the spirit of generosity, so deeply embedded in American tradition, 
that is the real alternative to meanness.  
</P>
<P>
 Let's steal Christmas back from the Grinch.

RAIDERS SEE KANSAS CITY IN DISTANCE; PRO FOOTBALL: DELAYED TRIP HOME FROM 
SEATTLE PUTS TEAM BEHIND IN PREPARATION FOR SATURDAY'S GAME AGAINST CHIEFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This may be a short week for the Raiders. But it began with one long night. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with playing the Kansas City Chiefs in six days with perhaps their 
season on the line, the Raiders first had to endure a six-hour journey home 
from Seattle, normally a 2 1/2-hour plane trip at most. 
</P>
<P>
 That left them no time to savor Sunday night's narrow escape from the 
Kingdome, where Seahawk kicker John Kasay's potential game-winning field goal 
from 43 yards out in the closing seconds curved wide right by about the width 
of the football, giving the Raiders a 17-16 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders were given Monday off, presumably to catch up on their sleep. They 
will go back to work today, normally a day off, to prepare for the Chiefs, who 
have beaten the Raiders in nine of their last 10 meetings, playoffs included. 
The Chiefs won in Kansas City earlier this season, 13-3. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no time off, though, for Raider Coach Art Shell, who still hadn't 
made it home by Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's charter jet took off from Seattle about 11:30 Sunday night, but fog 
at Los Angeles International Airport diverted the flight to Ontario. By the 
time the Raiders were bused back to LAX and then drove their own cars home, it 
was after 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell went directly to the team's El Segundo headquarters where, bleary-eyed, 
he watched the Seahawk game film before turning his attention to the Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I quickly looked at the film, put it away and started on Kansas City," Shell 
said. "The emphasis has to be on Kansas City." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the performance of his offensive line Sunday night had to bring a smile 
to Shell's weary face. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a former offensive lineman, Shell knows all too well the problems 
linemen face in a noisy arena like the Kingdome, where hearing your quarterback 
call signals is simply not possible sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least the lineman knows what he is supposed to do, even if he can't 
hear just when he is supposed to do it. Sunday night, Kevin Gogan didn't even 
have that advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 When left tackle Gerald Perry was knocked out of the game because of a 
concussion and his replacement, Robert Jenkins, was ejected for unsportsmanlike 
conduct, Gogan, the starting right guard, was moved to right tackle, a position 
he hadn't played in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran Max Montoya went in at right guard and Greg Skrepenak was moved from 
right to left tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders gave up five sacks, but, with Hostetler taking a shorter drop from 
center, the line gave him the time to throw the game-winning touchdown pass to 
Tim Brown on a play covering 77 yards. And, led by Harvey Williams' 93 rushing 
yards, the Raiders were able to gain 116 yards on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under the circumstances, I thought they performed admirably," Shell said. 
"Especially Gogan, having not played the position or even practiced. We knew he 
was an emergency tackle, but we didn't figure the emergency would come that 
fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Gogan might not have come to the Kingdome prepared to play tackle, but, as a 
Seattle resident in the off-season, he knows all about the Kingdome and came 
prepared for the noise. 
</P>
<P>
 He had earplugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Earplugs to better hear your quarterback? Really, insisted Gogan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earplugs (drown out) the crowd and I was able to hear Hoss real good," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Originally, Shell had planned to put Gogan in on the left side, but the coach 
decided he would at least give Gogan the opportunity to stay on the side he is 
more familiar with, if not the position. Was that at Gogan's urging? 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't tell him nothing," the 6-foot-7, 315-pound Gogan said with a laugh. 
"He's the head coach. But we (the offensive line) were all talking and we got 
our communication downpretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders hope things can return to normal this week with everybody back in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry, who had not suffered a concussion before, hopes to be back in the 
lineup. He was ready to go back in Sunday, but was told by doctors to forget 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 That apparently was good advice, considering that Perry seemed to have 
forgotten just about everything that happened Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Who hit him in the head to cause the concussion? 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea," Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
 What did he think when Jenkins was ejected? 
</P>
<P>
 Perry didn't recall that either. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember somewhat of a fight but I'm not sure I remember that much of the 
game," hesaid. "It was a strange feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Did he recall watching Kasay's nerve-racking final kick? 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, that I remember," Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a game worth remembering for the Raiders. And a night worth forgetting.

 He flew in from the right side, from out on the perimeter as if catapulted by 
a trampoline, plucked the rebound out of the air and, in one motion, rammed it 
down through the basket. It was a spectacular play, and even the fans in 
Reunion Arena were in awe. 
</P>
<P>
 But later that night, as the Lakers flew from Dallas to Houston and talked 
about the game against the Mavericks, rookie shooting guard Eddie Jones didn't 
dwell on his 19 points or the play that will go nicely on the resume as he 
hopes to earn a spot in the annual dunk contest during All-Star weekend. He 
boasted about his six steals. About his defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Had this been a rare moment, that would be one thing. But quite the contrary. 
If anything, that scene on the charter a week ago was a moment that typified 
the Lakers of 1994-95, a microcosm of the improvement that has led to a 13-8 
record and a tie for the fourth-most victories in the Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 They are a young team that uses defense as fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 They are a young team that doesn't act young anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 And, yes, they are surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very much so," said Executive Vice President Jerry West. 
</P>
<P>
 It helps to have last season as a contrast, bad in the standings and even 
worse in appearances, with chemistry so bad it might as well have been toxic 
and too many players worried primarily about their shots and minutes. In other 
words, they had become the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about attitude now," said Nick Van Exel, who has developed into a leader 
in his second season. "We had a lot of chances to be a pretty good team last 
year, but everybody had coach problems, everybody was having a problem with 
playing time. This year, we threw all that out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have been us looking in the mirror. We were just tired of being 
talked bad about. We were tired of walking around L.A. and having people say we 
were not good and we didn't try hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Like fans? 
</P>
<P>
 "The fans. The owner," Van Exel said. "We heard it from just about everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Change was evident from the start. Sedale Threatt, about to begin his 12th 
season, attended a mini-camp for rookies and free-agent hopefuls just before 
the regular training camp because he wanted to get a jump on learning the 
system of the new coach, Del Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 At training camp in Honolulu, the work ethic was intense. Sam Bowie said it 
was the first time in his pro career, which began in 1984, that no player had 
bailed out of any of the two-a-day sessions with bogus injuries or looked for 
some other shortcut. Nobody cruised. Cedric Ceballos, then a Laker for only 
about two weeks, slammed the ball onto the court inside steamy Klum Gym when 
his side lost a scrimmage, as if it meant playoff elimination. 
</P>
<P>
 When the games counted, they stared down a schedule that had 10 of the first 
14, and 14 of 21, on the road. When people noticed that most of those were 
against the tame Eastern Conference and suggested the good start might have 
been little more than a fleeting aberration -- remember blowing a sure victory 
at Milwaukee and getting drilled by the Clippers? -- the Lakers beat Houston 
and Cleveland at the Forum, then knocked off the Rockets and Utah away from 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, they had gone from No. 6 in the league in blocked shots last 
season to No. 3 in 1994-95, heading into Monday's games, with Vlade Divac tied 
for fifth among individuals. From No. 7 in steals to No. 2, with Jones tied for 
10th. From No. 9 in turnovers forced to No. 2. Numbers that were already good 
got even better. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are very quick and very fast," San Antonio Coach Bob Hill said. "The 
defense has created this start for them." 
</P>
<P>
 The young legs make a big difference. The Lakers have had great success with a 
variety of presses and traps, but the rub is that Van Exel gets the respect of 
a veteran by having the freedom to call the defenses during huddles at the free 
throw line. The coach retains the power of veto but rarely goes against his 
23-year-old point guard. 
</P>
<P>
 How unusual a situation is it? Harris had coached a little more than eight 
seasons in the NBA before joining the Lakers, but this is the first time he has 
turned over that kind of decision to the players. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team likes it more," he said. "Veteran teams don't like to press as 
much. . . . You're out there tired, and it hurts to go and do it. The worst 
defense in the world is a press when two or three of the guys aren't committed. 
But these guys, when they go after it, they're serious." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the top six Lakers are plodders, even big men Divac and Elden 
Campbell, so this is their counter to getting beat on the boards, just as 
averaging the fewest turnovers helps make up for a poor shooting percentage. 
Harris figures the pressing has been directly responsible for five or six 
victories and gave them a chance in two other games that eventually became 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think guys are beginning to trust each other more," Harris said. "That's 
such a key word in team defense -- trust. Nobody wants to look bad out there. 
If I run over to cover Player A, I want to make sure somebody will watch my 
back and cover Player B." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, looking bad hasn't been much of a problem.

IT'S NO LONGER FOREIGN TO HIM; IME ODUOK UNDERSTANDS BASKETBALL NOW AND HE'S 
PAYING OFF IN BIG WAY AT LOYOLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 College basketball coaches spend untold days and nights trying to woo 
recruits, only to see them sometimes turn elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, though, players fall into coaches' laps. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the experience of Loyola Marymount Coach John Olive, who didn't have to 
travel halfway around the world, or even across town, to find his starting 
center and most productive player. 
</P>
<P>
 Ime Oduok (e-MAY o-DWOK), a 6-foot-9, 240-pound junior from Eket, Nigeria, 
came halfway around the world to him.  
</P>
<P>
 Oduok arrived on the Loyola campus to play in pickup games in the summer of 
1992. He was unpolished, unschooled in the game's subtleties and, worse, 
already enrolled at tiny Pacific Christian College in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just a raw kid who maybe could make it," Olive said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three years earlier, when he was 16, Oduok had given up soccer and taken 
up basketball at the insistence of a relative, a businessman who learned of the 
on-court accomplishments of another Nigerian, Hakeem Olajuwon of the Houston 
Rockets, during a trip to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Oduok, who had never heard of his famous countryman, spent about a year 
learning to dribble and shoot. And then, after joining a team, he had to play 
barefoot on the outdoor concrete courts because size-18 basketball shoes could 
not be found to fit him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had bumps all over my feet," he said. "It was a terrible experience. But I 
wouldn't let anything stop me. Ever since I was told to go into basketball, I 
always said I was going to do this no matter what. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that was my first building block, so I had to play regardless." 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from high school in 1991, Oduok and younger sisters Uduak, 
Mary and Unwan were brought to the United States by their mother, Emo Ebitu. 
The others settled in San Jose, but Ime stayed with his father, Inyang, who 
lives about three blocks from the Loyola campus in Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
 In January 1992, he enrolled at Pacific Christian and joined the basketball 
team for the second half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a funny story," said Pacific Christian Coach Lee Erickson, whose 
team is ranked No. 1 this season among National Christian College Athletic 
Assn. Division II schools. "When I was called down by an admissions officer, 
I'd just read an article on the guy who was playing for the Kansas City Chiefs 
-- who used to play for Azusa Pacific. The running back from Nigeria (Christian 
Okoye). 
</P>
<P>
 "And I was asked if I could come down and meet with a recruit. I said, 'Not 
unless he's 6-7 or over, and he's from Nigeria.' " 
</P>
<P>
 To Erickson's surprise, Oduok fit the bill but . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "He was very, very green," Erickson said. "As a matter of fact, he really 
couldn't dunk the ball. But he was an athlete. You could tell that very 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, we put him in the post and tried to use his ability because he didn't 
have very much knowledge about how to play the game. But he could play and he 
could get boards. And he had a pretty good shooting touch. From the limited 
play he had in Africa, he could shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would block a lot of shots and once in a while, he'd score. He just kept 
getting better." 
</P>
<P>
 In 17 games, Oduok averaged 7.4 points, 10.6 rebounds and 2.8 blocked shots, 
helping the Royals win the Western Christian Athletic Conference championship 
and reach the semifinals of the NCCAA Division II tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 He had his best game in the season finale, scoring 22 points and taking 23 
rebounds against San Jose Christian College in the third-place game at the 
national tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, he wanted to know why we weren't playing somebody like Seton Hall 
or Georgetown," Erickson said. "He didn't really understand the structure." 
</P>
<P>
 When he did, Oduok wanted to move to a major college. And after holding his 
own against major-college players in pickup games at Loyola the following 
summer, he walked into Olive's office and asked the coach if he had any 
scholarships available. 
</P>
<P>
 Olive told him that he did and, after watching him play, offered him one. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was absolutely raw, had no idea how to play the game, but he had good 
athletic instincts besides being physically gifted with his size," Olive said. 
"At the very worst, we felt that he would be an interior defensive presence who 
could rebound and block shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he had no sense of offense. That's where he has really come along much 
more quickly than I would have thought possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Under NCAA rules, Oduok had to return to Pacific Christian for a semester to 
complete his freshman year before transferring to Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
 After sitting out a year, he joined the Lions last December and moved into the 
starting lineup almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 In his sixth major college game, he had 15 points and 22 rebounds in a 93-77 
victory over Buffalo. He had 18 points and 10 rebounds against Pepperdine, and 
19 points, 11 rebounds and five blocked shots against Cal State Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Although prone to foul trouble, he started 18 of 23 games and ended the season 
with averages of 7.6 points and 7.5 rebounds. He made 56% of his shots and was 
second in the West Coast Conference with 39 blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 But he lacked consistency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last season, he probably felt like a record on speed 78," Olive said. 
"Everything was probably buzzing around him. He couldn't get comfortable. He 
was in foul trouble constantly. But the games that he was able to stay out of 
foul trouble and play well, we did well." 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Oduok has kept his fouls to a minimum and Loyola, which plays 
Washington tonight at Gersten Pavilion, is 5-1, its best start in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Oduok is averaging 14.8 points and 12 rebounds and has made 58.9% of his 
shots. The only negative has been his 41.1% free-throw shooting. He had a 
career-high 27 points and 16 rebounds against Notre Dame but made only 11 of a 
school-record 23 free throws, a major factor in the Lions losing the game in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, three players fouled out trying to contain him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't handle him," Irish Coach John MacLeod said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not so easy anymore, despite his rudimentary skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's in the flow of the game," Olive said. "Last year, so often he just 
wasn't in the flow. He just wasn't comfortable. I think the biggest adjustment 
is, he has gotten very comfortable in a game he knew very little about. 
</P>
<P>
 "The second thing he's improved on dramatically is his offensive game, which 
is still pretty crude. We've worked on very simple things. We've worked on one 
move over his right shoulder and one move over his left shoulder in the low 
post. 
</P>
<P>
 "He drop-steps very well either way and now has a little jump hook over his 
left shoulder, which he had no idea how to shoot two years ago. He's worked 
very hard." 
</P>
<P>
 How far has he come? 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, miles," Olive said. "I never would have thought that he would be where he 
is today. But how could you ever guess? You never know how quickly someone's 
going to learn. But Ime's so bright. He's a real quick study." 
</P>
<P>
 Oduok, an accounting major, said his improved numbers this season are the 
result of experience and a strong belief in himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gained a better understanding of the basic concepts of the game," he 
said. "I believe that I can dominate and really stand out, and so I try to put 
that belief in action by trying to play with a sense of confidence. (A few 
years ago,) I wasn't so aware of what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Oduok, who made 62.9% of his free throws last season, is aware that his 
shooting from the foul line must improve if the Lions are to continue to be 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
 After missing two free throws with 16.7 seconds to play in regulation against 
Notre Dame, he was the last one out of the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just sat there with his head down for probably half an hour," Olive said. 
"I think he took it pretty personal, as a number of kids did. He's very 
competitive, very sensitive, very proud. He takes a lot of pride in everything 
he does." 
</P>
<P>
 And so it is that, despite his progress, Oduok still sees much room for 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't really felt relaxed, or felt my instincts take over," he said. "I 
haven't reached the point where I was in soccer. I haven't even started yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would enjoy it better if I was able to dominate the way I would like to, 
but I like it that we're winning." 
</P>
<P>
 If he continues to improve, of course, so will Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
 And then . . . the NBA? 
</P>
<P>
 "If he continues to progress at the same rate, a 6-9, 240-pound athlete like 
that would have a chance," Olive said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Will he plateau? I don't know. My sense is that he'll continue to improve for 
a while."

JIM MURRAY: RAMS SHOULD PACK IN THOUGHTS OF MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many years ago, when I first came to this state, there was a disenchanted war 
worker who was leaving the state in his dust and, as he pulled out of the last 
gas station in Blythe, was seen to have fastened a banner to the back of his 
car. It read, "Goodby California and your gee dee red geraniums!" 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know whether the flora has gotten to the Rams, but as of this writing 
we are assured they will shortly be leaving our area for the sunny shores of 
St. Louis or the sound stages of Baltimore.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, in a very real sense, they left us a long time ago. I refer to their 
precipitous departure from the Coliseum to which they belonged as surely as 
Caruso belonged to La Scala. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not that there was anything wrong with Orange County. It was just that 
the Rams weren't really theirs. Anaheim should have had its own team to clasp 
to its bosom, not a fickle swain from the nerds to the north.  
</P>
<P>
 To me, the Rams were like the Frenchman who has a wife and a mistress. None of 
the three is ever completely happy. The Rams' owner at the time, Carroll 
Rosenbloom, thought he could cash in on a rich real estate come-on and, at the 
same time, keep the affection and patronage of jilted L.A. He couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, the Raiders rushed into the vacuum. For another, the Rams' core 
constituency, the suffering patrons of L.A.'s Westside, never really moved with 
the team. They cashed out of the game. It was the Rams' loss.  
</P>
<P>
 It was a mistake all around. The league had a well-exercised penchant for 
keeping on the move. After all, the Washington Redskins were originally the 
Boston Redskins. The Arizona Cardinals were the Chicago Cardinals two 
incarnations ago. The Baltimore Colts had been so many things you couldn't keep 
track of them before they became the Indianapolis Colts. The Giants and the 
Jets moved out of New York. And so on.  
</P>
<P>
 The community identification is an important one to athletic teams. Otherwise, 
you have traveling minstrel shows -- Have Football, Will Travel. People don't 
paint themselves blue and gold and wear antlers on Mohawk haircuts for passing 
vaudevillians.  
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, of course, were originally the Cleveland Rams. But there is no 
evidence Cleveland put up much of a fight to keep them there. Pro football was 
not that big a deal in 1946.  
</P>
<P>
 There is less evidence that L.A. put up much of a fight to get them here. On 
the contrary, the colleges, USC and UCLA, lobbied hard and heavy to keep them 
out. Believe me, the Rams arrived with their hats in their hands, tugging on 
their forelocks, wiping their feet. They buttered up the newspapers by playing 
charity games. The Pro Bowl was invented for the L.A. Newspaper Publishers 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams had to outfight and later cannibalize the All-America Football 
Conference to stay here, but it was impossible to imagine the crowds. The Rams 
drew 102,368 to a 49er game in 1957. They drew more than 100,000 twice in 1958. 
They drew a total of 994,000 fans in 1952, almost double what any team had 
drawn up to that time. More than 100,000 people showed up at the Rose Bowl one 
year for a night exhibition.  
</P>
<P>
 The Rams belonged in Los Angeles and so did pro football. It moved the pro 
game into the big time and made it a national sport a dozen years before 
baseball, hockey and pro basketball caught on and moved West as well.  
</P>
<P>
 It is inconceivable that the Rams would reverse direction and head back where 
they came from 50 years ago. They would be leaving a fan base bigger than that 
of a half-dozen Midwestern states put together. They would be bucking a trend. 
They would be leaving a state where there are 32 million people, three-quarters 
of them south of the Tehachapi Mountains, for a state where there are 5 
million.  
</P>
<P>
 Pro football is unique. It has to fill its seats only eight games a year, as 
opposed to 81 for baseball, and about half that for basketball and hockey. This 
makes it possible for a community as small as Green Bay to survive. But Green 
Bay is one of a kind. TV wants a megalopolis, not a whistle stop, for its 
huckstering.  
</P>
<P>
 Earthquakes and age have made the Coliseum sclerotic. Is it possible they have 
done the same things to L.A.? The notion here is that Southern California will 
always be a Mecca as long as there is a thermometer. Carroll Rosenbloom should 
not have moved 15 years ago. Georgia should not now.  
</P>
<P>
 There is no question as to her right to do so. The appellate courts, wherever 
asked to rule on law and order, have found for law and disorder. The 
Constitution, they seem to think, opts for chaos.  
</P>
<P>
 If we lose the Rams, what happens next? Do the Dodgers go to Hackensack, the 
Lakers to Sheboygan, the Angels to Biloxi?  
</P>
<P>
 In their last full NFL season in St. Louis, the Cardinals drew 194,748 at 
home. Last year, with a 5-11 team, the Rams drew 363,211. In 1991 at home, the 
Rams drew 502,135. Back in 1958 in the Coliseum, the Rams drew 502,084 -- in 
six games.  
</P>
<P>
 You tell me why they're leaving. "Meet Me In St. Louis" is just a song. 
Somebody should call an audible at the line of scrimmage and change this play. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing wrong with Anaheim that a good quarterback won't cure. And no 
quarterback in the league would call this play. It has incomplete written all 
over it. Maybe interception. If they're lucky, it'll be sacked.

LONG BEACH STATE NOTEBOOK / JASON REID; GREENBERG CHANGES LOOK OF THE TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jason Reid 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An embarrassing loss Dec. 6 to lowly Cal State Northridge infuriated 49er 
men's basketball Coach Seth Greenberg so much that he angrily vowed in a 
postgame talk with reporters to make sweeping changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although much of Greenberg's anger has subsided since that 64-58 nonconference 
defeat, he hasn't backed off his plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The lineup will have a markedly different look when Long Beach (2-1) plays 
host to Montana (6-2) 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at The Pyramid, its first game in 15 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg suspended senior forward Terrance O'Kelley (6 feet 7 and 245 
pounds), who some experts say has a future in the NBA, for the game because of 
his academic performance. O'Kelley is in good standing at Long Beach and is 
eligible according to NCAA guidelines, Greenberg said, but he has not 
maintained the performance Greenberg wants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doing this for Terrance," Greenberg said. "The easiest thing for me is 
just to play Terrance if I want to be selfish and put the best team I could on 
the court. But that doesn't do Terrance any good and it doesn't do any other 
kid in our program any good." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior swingman Jamie Davis (6-5, 215) now starts at one guard spot. Junior 
Eric Brown (6-6, 215), who had been starting in place of injured sophomore 
James Cotton, now comes off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a skilled offensive player, has averaged 7.3 points while making 53% of 
his shots. Greenberg, however, wants more than shooting out of the position. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis has averages of 11 points and 5.3 rebounds in about 27 minutes per game. 
He's shooting 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jamie has a very complete game," Greenberg said. "He's a good passer, and he 
puts the ball on the floor with a purpose. Eric gives us a guy who can come in 
and score off the bench." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Davis must show more on defense to keep the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my biggest concern," Greenberg said. "He's doing a terrible job in 
defensive transition and he's not doing a very good job fighting through 
screens." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Davis is a better passer than Brown. His promotion is based partly on 
the 49ers' horrid execution of Greenberg's motion offense against the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jamie puts another passer in the game for us," Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tye Mays' return should also help. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior point guard (6-1, 190), an occasional starter last season, was 
academically ineligible for the first semester because Long Beach academic 
officials incorrectly advised him. He is behind starter Rasul Salahuddin (6-2, 
185) but might play considerable minutes against Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me," Mays said, "this feels like the opening day of The Pyramid." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Greenberg: "We instantly become better at point guard." 
</P>
<P>
 Hopefully for the 49ers, Greenberg will soon speak similarly about the entire 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the move . . . again: Much-traveled point guard Frank Harris, who has 
attended four colleges since the 1991-92 season, plans to transfer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of New York, Harris (6-3, 185) is not on scholarship. He said the 
cost of attending Long Beach has become a financial hardship for his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris said several coaches have contacted him since he decided to leave Long 
Beach, but he declined to be specific. Greenberg said the coaching staff will 
help Harris anyway it can. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to leave, I really enjoyed it here, but financially it's becoming kind 
of burdensome," Harris said. "Paying fees, having to pay monthly to live to 
eat, it's becoming pretty expensive not being on scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
 A redshirt junior, Harris, 22, was behind junior starter Salahuddin and senior 
Mays. He probably would not have been on the travel squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris played at Davidson in North Carolina as a freshman, averaging 10.4 
points. After the season, he transferred to Connors State Junior College in 
Warner, Okla. Harris was named a first-team All-American by Future Stars 
Magazine after leading his team in scoring average at 20.1 points and leading 
the conference in assists at 7.3. 
</P>
<P>
 He received a scholarship to Stanford after the season, but left Palo Alto in 
February 1993 after being beaten for the starting position.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton eyeing return: Sophomore James Cotton's severely sprained left ankle is 
healing so well that the standout guard says he will soon return. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The coaches) want me to play in the (Michigan State tournament, Dec. 29-30), 
but that's kind of far-fetched right now," Cotton said. "I'm shooting around 
right now, but I haven't even started running on it yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I can play then, but probably New Mexico State (Jan. 5) for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season's Big West Conference freshman of the year, Cotton (6-6, 205) 
suffered the injury in the 49ers' final exhibition game Nov. 18. He undergoes 
about three hours of therapy six days a week. After Wednesday, he will no 
longer wear a removable cast. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton, who averaged 11.5 points and 4.3 rebounds as a freshman, was expected 
to be the focal point of the offense this season. He thought about seeking a 
medical redshirt year because of the injury, but has dismissed those thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's pretty much out unless it takes longer than we think," Cotton said. 
"I'm ready to play. I want to play."

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; THINGS LOOKING UP FOR MEN'S BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Weyler 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Their five-game, season-opening road swing is over and the Anteaters have 
emerged with reason to be optimistic about the rest of the 1994-95 men's 
basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Greg Vetrone walked into a Phoenix delicatessen after Saturday 
night's loss to 13th-ranked Arizona State sporting a wide grin. Vetrone spent 
most of last season sitting on the Irvine bench with his head buried in his 
hands. After games, he tended to swear a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm smiling," he said, sounding genuinely surprised. "Look at me, I'm 
smiling." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine, which staggered to a humiliating 4-14 regular-season Big West record 
before a run to the final of the conference tournament, figures to have a 50-50 
chance of winning most nights. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters are 2-3, but have lost twice to teams ranked among the top 15 
nationally and lost at Oklahoma when the Sooners' best player scored 25 points 
before he missed a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different this season," said Coach Rod Baker. "Before, as long as we got 
out without embarrassing ourselves, it was a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is that we're better. The fact is you notice. And we're going to be 
even better. But this isn't the time to be encouraged about anything. This is 
the time to play." 
</P>
<P>
 The potential for improvement is there. Irvine has three new starters and the 
Anteaters are clearly in an adjustment period. But their depth and ability to 
make plays even when their set offensive schemes break down bodes well for the 
upcoming conference season. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a quick look at the new guys and how they've played so far: 
</P>
<P>
 * Point guard Raimonds Miglinieks is a bit of an enigma. He went into the 
Arizona State game as the team's leading scorer, then failed to take a shot 
simply because he either found a teammate open or didn't get a good look at the 
basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Miglinieks can handle the ball in traffic with incredible aplomb and continues 
to surprise opponents -- and sometimes teammates -- with his uncanny ability to 
thread Dan Marino-like passes through defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night, he fired an assist to Mark Odsather that passed within inches 
of three Sun Devils, all of whom were stunned and failed to do so much as raise 
a hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Miglinieks, a Latvian native and former Red Army conscript, is averaging six 
assists, but that number could easily be in double figures if startled 
teammates had not missed shots or failed to see the pass coming and missed it 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot more of those passes are being caught than they were two months ago," 
Baker said. "And even more will be caught in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 * Freshman forward Kevin Simmons had been a consistent force inside until he 
went scoreless against Arizona State. Simmons appeared to be a bit intimidated 
after his first couple of shots were blocked, but he has good instincts, a nice 
shooting touch and four years to improve. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons, an all-state selection at Brooklyn's Tilden High, is third on the 
team in playing time. He had no fewer than eight rebounds in each of the 
Anteaters' first four games, but came down with only three against the Sun 
Devils. 
</P>
<P>
 * Forward Michael Tate is only 6 feet 4 -- if that -- but he plays with such 
passion and abandon that he already has earned the respect of a number of 
opposing coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The junior transfer from Ventura College has been dominating as a defender and 
rebounder at times. He leads the Anteaters with an average of nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Tate is shooting 30% from the field, but he takes mostly high-percentage 
inside shots that often draw fouls and should start to fall. He made his first 
three shots -- a driving baseline bank shot, a short jump hook and a layup -- 
Saturday night as the Anteaters grabbed a 15-7 lead over the Sun Devils. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Uplifting experiences: The women's basketball team had a two-week layoff after 
its Dec. 3 victory over Colorado State and the Anteaters still were able to 
maintain some momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine beat Texas Christian, 74-67, Sunday when junior center Allah-mi Basheer 
scored 12 second-half points to lead the Anteaters back from a four-point 
halftime deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine is 2-3 this year, but only six points shy of being 4-1. Last season, 
the Anteaters were 5-23. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, we just seem to have a lot more pride and more confidence in our 
ability," Basheer said. "I think we have more heart, too. And that win over 
Colorado State was really a confidence booster for us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Newlywed game: Basheer was married last month to Sgt. Mateen Sabir, a Marine 
stationed at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
 "But nobody knows," she said. "It's kind of a secret." 
</P>
<P>
 Not anymore. Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The men's tennis team is ranked 37th in the nation and No. 9 in Region VIII. 
Sophomore Marc-Andre Tardif is the 28th-ranked singles player in the country 
and No. 6 in the region. Senior Chris Tontz is ranked No. 13 in the region. 
Tardif and Tontz are the region's No. 9 doubles team. . . . The sailing team, 
which is ranked No. 7 nationally, will compete Jan. 7-8 in the Rose Bowl 
Intersectional at Alamitos Bay.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL; HOLMES, TUINEI MAKE ALL-STATE 
FOOTBALL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Andre Holmes, a defensive back at Rancho Santiago College and and Golden 
West's Van Tuinei, a defensive lineman, were selected to the all-state football 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes, from Orange High, is the only freshman on the defensive team. Tuinei 
is from Westminster High. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes was also selected as the most valuable defensive player in Region IV, 
which comprises the 14 teams in the Mission Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Orange County players on the Region IV team are: Simon Fuentes (Rancho 
Santiago, quarterback); Caleb Kemp (Golden West, offensive line); Brandon 
LaGraffe (Fullerton, offensive line); Edgar Macias (Rancho Santiago, offensive 
line); Josh Micklos (Fullerton, defensive line); Jason Nevadomsky (Fullerton, 
linebacker); Andy Osborne (Saddleback, linebacker); Scott Patton (Saddleback, 
defensive back); Casey Shine (Rancho Santiago, tight end); Ernie Wilson (Rancho 
Santiago, running back) and Jim Wren (Fullerton, punter). 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Ogas, who led Rancho Santiago to a 9-2 record and the Mission Conference 
Central Division title, was the Region IV coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The obvious omission from the Region IV list was OCC running back Jeff 
Clayton. He gained 1,065 yards and scored 11 touchdowns for OCC. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shine to sign: Shine has made an oral commitment to Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey said he will fax his letter of intent Wednesday. He caught 22 passes for 
203 yards and two touchdowns in 11 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Shine, from El Modena, starts classes at Nevada in January. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Three-point zoo: The long-range shooting of the Cypress men's basketball team 
remains amazing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers' latest stunner came Saturday when they set the college's 
single-game mark with 19 three-pointers in 23 attempts in a 95-75 victory over 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The 19 makes (by three players) is an Orange County record. The state doesn't 
keep track of such marks. Gil Gonzales was eight for 10, Matt Kenney was six 
for eight, and Jeff Rutter made five of five against Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales, a freshman from Orange High, is 79 of 159 this season and is already 
third on the Cypress single-season list. Kenney, a sophomore from Servite, has 
made 53 of 116 and Rutter has 41 of 87 so far. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers (12-4) are 182 of 424 (.429) this season and a sure bet to break 
the college's single-season record of 226, set last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Necessity is the reason for the Chargers' frequent use of the outside shot. 
They have no player taller than 6 feet 4. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vanishing Rustlers: Golden West's Tom McClusky, in his first year as coach, 
also is losing a war of attrition. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West started the season with 15 players on the roster but four players 
quit. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the last two weeks, Golden West (6-8) has lost forward Tyrone Butler 
(knee), guard Dejuan Matthews (ankle), and forward Darvin Thompson (knee) to 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 All three were starters at various times this season and none is assured of 
being back by Jan. 4, the start of Orange Empire Conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West is left with eight healthy players, including sophomore guard 
Michael Dean, whom McClusky can't afford to rest for very long. Dean, averaging 
18.6 points, played the final 30 minutes of the Rustlers' 66-65 victory over 
Victor Valley on Saturday in the third-place game of the Cypress tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress' Sara Works probably will become the Chargers' all-time scoring leader 
this week. Works, from Savanna High, has 1,044 points in her career. Works, 
averaging 25 points, needs 16 to set the mark.

COMMENTARY; GIANTS' YOUNG, REEVES WERE RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The New York Giants already have won everything they need to win, whether they 
make the playoffs or not. They finish the NFL season with a quarterback in Dave 
Brown, and they finish with a chance at the playoffs. George Young and Dan 
Reeves gambled the whole season when they released Phil Simms, and won. 
</P>
<P>
 Simms deserved one more year from the Giants, and deserved to leave on his own 
terms. When he says they already would be in the playoffs if he were the 
quarterback, he is right. Maybe they would even be 10-5 instead of 8-7, and 
fighting with the Dallas Cowboys for first place, instead of fighting the rest 
of the world for the last wild-card berth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants come up winners anyway. If they finish with six consecutive 
victories after seven consecutive losses, if they somehow get to 9-7, this will 
go down as one of the crazy seasons in their history. Even at 8-8, it would be 
remembered that way. But after everything that happened to them, after all the 
interceptions and bad calls and losses, a .500 record is enough. Young and 
Reeves wanted to start the future right now. They have. They let the rest of us 
worry about Simms, and the past, and rode the thing out. 
</P>
<P>
 This does not mean Young is in the process of building one more Super Bowl 
team before he retires. It does not mean Young and Reeves get along much better 
than Young and Bill Parcells did. Maybe the only thing that would make this a 
really successful season for Reeves is if Young retired at the end of it and 
Reeves ended up with the whole operation. It does not change that Young and 
Reeves bet on Brown and won. 
</P>
<P>
 There were times during the losing streak when Reeves seemed to be losing his 
team, and his grip. There were questions about whether Young could still do the 
job. Here they both are, one game to go, right where they wanted to be when the 
season started. The whole thing did not fall apart on them and the Giants are 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most nights I miss regular-season hockey about the way Roseanne seems to miss 
Tom. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 When Boomer Esiason was brought to New York, he was supposed to make the Jets 
better. Now it is the Jets who are supposed to make Boomer better. I'm glad 
Pete Carroll cleared that up for me this week. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The television announcers for the Knicks got so giddy after John Starks had 
one decent game I thought they were going to give him a big hug every time he 
hit the rim. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Steve Young will end up being a runaway choice as pro football's most valuable 
player. The way Young has played since the first month of the season, people 
will want to vote for him twice. 
</P>
<P>
 But I don't see how anyone can run away from Barry Sanders, one of the best 
players in NFL history having one of the best seasons we will ever be 
privileged enough to see. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders with the ball in his hands has been the single most electrifying event 
of the NFL season. But the 49ers have the top record in the league, and might 
win another Super Bowl, and Young is going to be MVP. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there ought to be an award for Sanders, who could rush for 2,000 yards, 
and who has lit up the sport as much as Young. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks scored 85 points Friday night. Shaquille O'Neal and Anfernee 
Hardaway scored 78. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Don Nelson gave Chris Webber a one-year out in his contract. Don Nelson traded 
Chris Webber. Now everything that is happening to Nelson and the Warriors is 
supposed to be Chris Webber's fault.

CHAPMAN RALLIES TO DEFEAT OCCIDENTAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After struggling with its shooting early, Chapman got hot in the second half 
and beat Occidental, 86-76, in a nonconference men's basketball game Monday at 
the Hutton Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Chapman's significant height advantage -- Occidental has three players 
on its roster who are 6 feet 5 and the Panthers have seven -- Occidental came 
up big in the first half and led, 36-35, at the break. 
</P>
<P>
 Occidental (3-3) was especially pesky on defense inside, and Stefan Mumaw, 
Chapman's 6-8 center, made only two of eight shots in the first half. Mumaw 
wasn't the only poor-shooting Panther; Chapman made only 12 of 28 shots in the 
half (42%). 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been cold for five, let me see, six games," Chapman Coach Mike Bokosky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers experienced a thaw in the second half, making their first four 
shots and seven of their first 10 to take a 47-42 lead with 16 minutes 15 
seconds remaining. The Panthers made 50% of their second-half shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Mumaw scored 12 of his 18 points in the second half, Toby Curto scored 11 of 
his 15 and Ramin Bastani scored 10 of his 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Occidental hung tough, going on an 11-2 run to take a 56-53 lead with 10:28 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Chapman (6-3) soon responded with a spurt to put away the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Dzierzynski started the run with two free throws at the 6:06 mark. 
Occidental then made turnovers three of its next four times down the floor and 
Curto made a three-point shot and a layup on a fast break. By the time Curto 
scored again -- another three-pointer with 1:58 left -- the Panthers had 
outscored Occidental, 16-2, and led, 80-66. 
</P>
<P>
 Dzierzynski had 18 points and nine assists and Bastani had 16 points and five 
assists. Mumaw had a game-high 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Occidental's leading scorer John Pike scored 10 points, about 15 less than his 
average. Anson Credille, Kory Combs, a 1988 Tustin graduate, and Hon Trieu each 
scored 13.

COMMENTARY; QUARTERBACK ONLY ONE OF RAMS' QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams are a mess, but as quarterback Chris Miller suggested Monday, there's 
no sense dwelling on it because the team doesn't know if it's coming or going. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk of a move, the latest excuse being offered by players to explain away a 
4-11 season, has increased, but Ram woes go far beyond a potential change in 
ZIP codes. 
</P>
<P>
 They begin with Miller, who regularly ends his news briefings by saying, "Good 
enough?" Yet he has been anything but this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Hired for $9 million to save the day, Miller arrived in training camp and 
flashed leadership skills and incredible accuracy. Miller's early showing 
heightened Coach Chuck Knox's expectations, just as his regular-season collapse 
flattened the team's chances for success. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of things have happened this season," Knox said Monday. "I don't think 
you can dump it all on Miller. That would be my answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's future with the team, however, might be short-lived, depending on who 
is coaching it next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still think Chris Miller can play," Knox said, but based on present 
circumstances, he will play for Knox only if Chris Chandler is too hurt to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler left Sunday's game with the Chicago Bears limping, complaining of a 
sore back and later learning he had suffered a bruised kidney. If the Rams had 
practiced Monday, Knox said, Chandler would have been unable to participate. 
Knox will wait until Wednesday before deciding who will start against the 
Washington Redskins in the season finale, and that's a strong indication of 
what he thinks of Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's supposition," Knox said. "I don't think we've leaned heavily toward 
Chandler." 
</P>
<P>
 So why isn't the $9-million man the team's starting quarterback? 
</P>
<P>
 "No. 1, he has been banged up," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Miller is uninjured now, Chandler is not, so why isn't the $9-million man 
the team's starting quarterback? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of all the circumstances and factors and because of the presence of 
Chris Chandler," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so Knox has leaned heavily toward Chandler, but where does that leave the 
Rams? Chandler is 2-4 as a Ram starter and has been knocked out of more games, 
four, than the injury-prone Miller, who has been unable to finish three. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox won't play Tommy Maddox at quarterback because, he says, it wouldn't be 
fair to Maddox. But in a similar situation, rookie Toby Wright moved into the 
starting lineup a week ago in place of veteran Anthony Newman. 
</P>
<P>
 "He deserved the opportunity," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 So why not give Maddox such an opportunity? 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had a chance to see Maddox," Knox said, and it's all quite 
confusing. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't look for any answers from Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I need to do is prepare myself for this last week. We're playing the 
'Skins and that's all I'm concerning myself with now," said Miller, who has 
completed 52.7% of his passes this season. "There's going to be a lot shaking 
down after this year's over. There's going to be a lot transpiring during the 
off-season as far as coaches, players, team movement and all that." 
</P>
<P>
 But why has Miller's performance been so shaky this season? 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of reasons for it," Miller said. "I would like to have played 
better, put up better numbers and helped this team win more football games. But 
it didn't work out that way and there are a lot of reasons, but I'll just leave 
it at that." 
</P>
<P>
 Blame it on wide receiver Todd Kinchen, who has given away four punts in the 
last four games, and who continues to be employed as the team's punt returner. 
Blame it on an offensive line that has rendered running back Jerome Bettis 
useless. Blame it on a defensive line that has been anything but fearsome, or 
on special teams that have not been so special. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are a mess. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get into semantics; what is ugly?" Knox said. "We haven't had the type of 
year that we would have liked to have had. . . . We've lost six in a row, and 
that's a fact, but what can I tell people? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to call it a mess. I'll just say it's very, very disappointing. 
. . . But I still think we have the nucleus of a good football team. We've got 
some good young players and I think it bodes well for the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The future, however, has never looked so cloudy for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got one game left, so there's no reason to comment on what's going to 
happen next year because, hell, we don't know if we're going to be here or in 
St. Louis," Miller said. "Good enough? Been a pleasure."

BUCCANEERS PURSUE TALKS WITH ANGELOS BUT HAVEN'T RULED OUT OTHER OFFERS

 Negotiations between Baltimore Oriole owner Peter Angelos and Tampa Bay 
Buccaneer officials have reached the advanced stages, and Angelos said Monday 
he is close to buying the team and moving it to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 But Steve Story, one of three trustees in charge of the team since the death 
of owner Hugh Culverhouse, said the trustees will also talk this week with 
other interested parties, primarily those who want to keep the team in Tampa, 
including New York Yankee owner George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would definitely classify our meetings (with Angelos) . . . as going beyond 
the preliminaries," Story said. "We are going to move forward with some more 
in-depth discussion to see if we can consummate a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're interested in consummating a deal with someone quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos has said he is willing to pay $200 million for the team, an offer many 
competing bidders said they could not match.

MATER DEI GETS TWO EASY VICTORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There will come a moment during the next few days that will require some 
serious, down-to-the-bone basketball from Mater Dei. The field ahead demands 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, the Monarchs are happy to have a day of play behind them. There 
was nothing from the first two rounds in the Reebok Holiday Prep Classic to 
make them break a sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs (8-0) cruised to a 82-37 victory over Vancouver (Canada) Tech on 
Monday in their second-round game. It came on the heels of a 92-39 pasting of 
Payson (Utah) in the opener Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever anxiety the Monarch coaching staff had going blind into a 50-team 
tournament was eased moments into the first half of both games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear Payson will hold the ball on you forever if you let them," Coach Gary 
McKnight said before the first-round game. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so. But six minutes into the game it was 12-0 Mater Dei and holding the 
ball was no longer a Payson option. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory over Vancouver Tech was even more impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just don't know about your competition coming into these type of 
tournaments, especially the first day," Monarch assistant coach Dave Taylor 
said. "You just have to play straight up until you learn something about your 
opponent." 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei learned early on it was superior. The Monarchs needed little 
technique, just athletic prowess. Schea Cotton opened the game with a two-hand 
slam and the Monarchs were off. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 23-3 midway through the first half and 43-10 by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs were able to showcase their skills with the Talismen as straight 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton had six dunks, none of the run-of-the-mill high school variety. He 
scored 23 points and finished off his night with a three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 Clay McKnight dropped one three-pointer after another. He made five against 
Vancouver Tech, giving him 12 through two games. All his field goals in the 
first two games were three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaun Jackson scored 15 against Vancouver Tech, on drives, jump hooks and 
offensive rebounds. With no player taller than 6 feet 5, the Talismen couldn't 
stop the 6-7 Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 It all gave a playground atmosphere to the Monarchs' game. It was a welcome 
relief, coming on the heels of an intense game Saturday against Tustin in the 
Tournament of Champions. The Monarchs labored through the first three weeks of 
the season, but got a chance to play Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some real tough games lately," Cotton said. "We needed to get out 
and run tonight. It was fun." 
</P>
<P>
 That will change, starting today. The Monarchs play Federal Way (Wash.) 
Decatur -- played late Monday -- today in the third round. Decatur was 22-5 
last season and returns three starters. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition will get stiffer as the Monarchs advance. The tournament 
includes Compton Dominguez, Mouth of Wilson (Va.) Oak Hill Academy and 
Washington D.C. Dunbar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really think it was good for us," Clay McKnight said. "This talent 
was a step down from what we will be facing." 
</P>
<P>
 Still . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh yeah, it was fun tonight," Clay McKnight said.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; TICKETS SELLING SLOWLY FOR SEASON FINALE 
</P>

<P>
 The Rams said 31,300 tickets have been distributed for Saturday's game, 
against the Redskins, which might be the team's last home game in Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The team opened the season in front of 32,969, the smallest crowd for a home 
game since the move to Anaheim in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have an average attendance of 44,684 this season at home. Last year's 
season average of 45,401 has been the team's low mark to date in Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have nothing to play for Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The team cannot hurt its order in next year's draft, and the playoffs 
disappeared long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have assured themselves of having the fourth-worst record in the 
league, but instead of selecting fourth in the NFL draft, they will pick sixth. 
Jacksonville and Carolina already have been awarded the top two spots in the 
NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Jerome Bettis has a splint on the ring finger of his left hand, 
which might prevent him from practicing this week, but Coach Chuck Knox said he 
will be listed as probable for the season-ending game with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said X-rays on Bettis' injured finger were negative. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Israel, who began the year as the team's starting cornerback then got 
hurt and was replaced by Darryl Henley, will miss the final game of the season 
because of a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel, the team's No. 2 draft pick in 1992, has battled knee tendinitis 
throughout the season, and as a result has failed to live up to expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Tom Homco will be listed doubtful because of a foot injury, as will 
linebacker Chris Martin, who is bothered by a thigh injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive tackle Jimmie Jones stayed overnight in a Chicago hospital after 
suffering an abdominal injury, but tests revealed no internal damage and he 
returned Monday to Anaheim. Knox said he will be listed as probable for the 
game along with defensive tackle Sean Gilbert, who left last week's game 
because of a rib injury. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tackle Jackie Slater said he will hold off deciding whether to play in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Slater appeared prepared last week to make such a pronouncement, but said 
Monday it might be better to wait, considering the uncertainty surrounding the 
team. T.J. SIMERS

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; ALL THEY KNOW IS, WIN AND THEY'RE IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raiders know what they have to do to wind up in the playoffs: beat or tie 
the Kansas City Chiefs Saturday at the Coliseum or hope the New England 
Patriots lose to the Bears in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 What the Raiders don't know is where they'll play. 
</P>
<P>
 There are four possibilities for Saturday or Sunday of New Year's weekend -- a 
home game at the Coliseum against the Cleveland Browns, or a road game at 
Cleveland, Miami or San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what has to happen: 
</P>
<P>
 -- To get home-field advantage for the first round of the playoffs, the 
Raiders must beat the Chiefs and the Browns must lose to the Seattle Seahawks 
on Saturday. Both the Raiders and Browns would finish 10-6 and the Raiders 
would get the nod because of a better record among common opponents, 6-3 to 
3-5. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If both the Raiders and Browns win, Cleveland finishes 11-5 and gets home 
field for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If the Raiders and Patriots both lose, and the Miami Dolphins and San Diego 
Chargers both win or both lose, the Raiders would go to Miami. That's because 
the Dolphins would win the AFC East, but would have the worst record among AFC 
division winners, necessitating a home game the first weekend of the playoffs 
against the Raiders, who would be the lowest ranked AFC wild-card team. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If the Raiders, Patriots and Chargers lose and the Dolphins win, San Diego 
loses a tiebreaker to Miami, making the Chargers the lowest-ranked AFC division 
winner, meaning San Diego would play host to the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Got all that? 
</P>
<P>
 Raider coach Art Shell doesn't even want to hear about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll determine our fate on Saturday," he said. "If we win, we're in. I 
haven't studied that other stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Safety Eddie Anderson, who missed Sunday's game against the Seahawks because 
of a groin pull, is improved, Shell said. "Hopefully, he'll be ready to go," 
Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't connect, but I threw the blow," Raider offensive lineman Robert 
Jenkins said of the punch that got him ejected Sunday. "That's wrong to do 
that. We are supposed to be men, professionals, especially when you have a 
nationwide game and you have little kids watching. I'm very embarrassed. 
Sometimes that happens, but I can tell you that it will never happen again, at 
least to me." STEVE SPRINGER

NEXT STEP; U.N. IN BOSNIA: THE ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE CHAOS; HOLY WAR, LAND GRAB, 
EXODUS AND GENOCIDE ARE AMONG TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES FORESEEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The battered and bleeding U.N. Protection Force may succumb to the Serb 
nationalist forces trying to run it out of the Balkans, but Turkey insists that 
its 2,000 U.N. peacekeepers in Bosnia-Herzegovina are there to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Ditto Malaysia, which has 1,500 troops in Bosnia, and Pakistan with 3,000 
more. All three are Muslim nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is Islamic Iran's vow to send 10,000 troops to protect Bosnia's 
Muslims if U.N. peacekeepers, drawn primarily from the Christian world, concede 
they have failed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of the threat of an Islamic army, Russia and Ukraine, with more 
than 1,000 Bosnia-based U.N. soldiers between them, would be unlikely to 
abandon the Bosnian Serbs, their Slavic, Orthodox brethren. Even Greece, 
another Orthodox country ill-disposed toward Muslims of the former Yugoslav 
federation, might join the Slavic powers to match the rival religion's forces 
and protect the military advantages long enjoyed by nationalist Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 If the United Nations' 23,500 peacekeepers cave in to Serbian pressure for 
their departure, what sometimes seems a nationalist conflict could devolve into 
a pitiless holy war. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muslims of Bosnia have fought for nearly three years to convince the 
outside world that the conflict that has taken their homes, land and 200,000 
countrymen has virtually nothing to do with religion. 
</P>
<P>
 But transformation of a territorial struggle into a proxy battle between 
Orthodox Slavs and resurgent Islam is only one of the frightening scenarios 
awaiting Bosnia, and the rest of the world, if the U.N. force pulls out. 
</P>
<P>
 A withdrawal would be tantamount to blowing the starting whistle for a final 
land grab, U.N. officials and Western diplomats warn. Anticipating that an end 
to the U.N. arms embargo against Muslims would soon follow, the Bosnian Serbs, 
no longer hindered by the presence of U.N. soldiers, would probably rush to 
capitalize on their huge artillery advantage and roll over the remaining 
Muslim-inhabited territories they covet in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Encircled Muslim enclaves in the eastern part of the former Yugoslav republic 
could be overrun within hours of a pullout, since the U.N. protective 
deployments have been made on condition that "safe area" militias surrender 
their guns. Unarmed, the isolated areas would be defenseless. 
</P>
<P>
 If the U.N. mission was to abandon its responsibility for protecting the 
40,000 residents of Srebrenica or the 25,000 in the Zepa safe area, the 
peacekeepers would have done the Serbs' dirty work for them by neutralizing the 
enclaves' defenses, then leaving their Muslim inhabitants to the Serbs' mercy. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Muslims, dispirited and submissive, would probably be herded like 
cattle into central Bosnia or Croatia. Anyone daring defiance of the emboldened 
rebels would face brutal detention if not slaughter, say longtime observers of 
the Bosnian fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 New refugee flows into regions already struggling to support 2 million other 
homeless would strengthen the hand of Croatian nationalists, who have warned 
repeatedly that the peaceful diplomacy advocated by the West would lead to 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatia's rightist government could fall to the neo-fascist factions so far 
kept at bay, and the fragile Bosnian Croat-Muslim federation in central Bosnia 
would be sure to collapse with the influx of more angry and resentful victims 
of the Serbian nationalists' "ethnic cleansing." 
</P>
<P>
 "The suffering of the civilian population, particularly in the enclaves -- and 
let's include Sarajevo among the enclaves -- will be of such tragic proportions 
that there may be a cry for reintroduction of some kind of international force 
again," U.N. mission chief Yasushi Akashi said of the possibility that his 
peacekeepers might be forced to pull out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there will be a sharpening of the conflict, that the conflict will 
become even more unbreachable than now, and with spilling-over effects beyond 
Bosnia-Herzegovina or southern Croatia," Akashi predicted in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wins," he continued, drawing a bleak vision of life after the U.N. 
force. "If it spreads, it will be a major destabilizing force in Europe, and it 
will exacerbate the cleavage between the United States and Russia, and trends 
toward religious intolerance may be enhanced. There would be increased doubts 
about the United Nations' ability to cope with this kind of strife, typical of 
the post-Cold War period. Insecurity will be deepened." 
</P>
<P>
 Eroding security and Serb nationalist dominance in Bosnia are already 
undermining the manufactured peace imposed nearly three years ago in Croatia. A 
territorial free-for-all triggered by a U.N. departure would be certain to 
reopen the unresolved war here. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Serbia and Croatia, old enemies, have spent the interval arming for a 
decisive second round, promising what, as one senior Western diplomat here 
cautions, would be "a war with all the incivility of Bosnia and many times the 
weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 The most perilous scenario possible in the wake of a U.N. withdrawal is the 
risk of a NATO-led evolution of the peacekeeping role into "peace enforcement," 
a military euphemism for armed intervention to vanquish the Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials warn privately that withdrawal is so fraught with hazards for 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that the peacekeepers may be forced to 
stay. They ask how the Atlantic Alliance could provide aerial cover for 
commandos trying to evacuate U.N. troops from Serbian-surrounded areas in the 
face of dozens -- some reports claim more than 100 -- newly positioned 
surface-to-air missile batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Any NATO attack on the missile sites would set off an even more alarming spate 
of hostage-taking than occurred after NATO air strikes in November, forcing the 
alliance to choose between a humiliating backing away or an ever-escalating 
guerrilla war with the Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Short of a massive ground invasion, U.N. and diplomatic observers ask, how 
would NATO break through the miles of mountainous Serbian-held territory to 
liberate peacekeepers from the enclaves and position better-armed NATO forces 
to take their place? 
</P>
<P>
 Yet if the outside world signals it has given up efforts to stop the war in 
Bosnia, U.N. officials wonder aloud what excuse any major power would have to 
intervene when and if the conflict spreads to other explosive remains of the 
former Yugoslav federation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't go away," Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic warned of the 
Balkan conflict currently consuming his state. "The international community's 
strategy is to contain the fire within Bosnia. But what they don't realize is 
that you cannot contain viruses and ideas. The virus of aggressive nationalism 
is already out." 
</P>
<P>
 Political analysts have repeatedly warned that Western abandonment of Bosnia 
would leave it easy prey for fundamentalist countries seeking an Islamic 
foothold in Europe. Ironically, Serbian nationalists in Belgrade, the Yugoslav 
and Serbian capital, have used that threat of Islamic fundamentalism as an 
excuse for bludgeoning Bosnia's secular Muslims in a poorly veiled campaign to 
take their land. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an example of the self-fulfilling prophecy that has been a leitmotif of 
Serbian propaganda, that danger of rising Islamic influence has suddenly become 
real. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word is out that the use of force is OK and that Muslims are not safe in 
Europe. Those two things put together will cost hundreds of times more in 
resources and money and men than a solid use of force in Bosnia would have 
cost," said Silajdzic, the disillusioned leader who counseled his government 
and people to heed the advice of Western democracies to take the pacifist high 
road when the heavily armed nationalists attacked 32 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian government officials have appealed to the United Nations to keep its 
forces in the exposed eastern enclaves, as a minimum, to shield defenseless 
civilians and to ensure the provision of humanitarian aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Although international aid agencies say they intend to stay on in Bosnia to 
perform humanitarian work as long as possible, their positions could become 
untenable as the modicum of security maintained by the U.N. presence evaporates 
amid renewed artillery fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would still have a job to do, and the need would probably be even 
greater," said Peter Kessler, spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees here. "But if there are no new (international) forces 
coming into these territories after (the U.N. troops), you're going to see a 
lot more panic and insecurity." 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler warned that, if rebel Serb gunmen sought to block aid convoys to 
isolated Muslim communities, those populations would be forced to migrate.  
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the dangers and disruptions inflicted on the Bosnian population in 
the event of renewed all-out war, what little economic sustenance civilians 
have been getting will disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 "About the only people working in Bosnia now are those who work for (the U.N. 
force) or for relief agencies or for the journalists," said Ksenija 
Miladinovic, a Sarajevo mother of two employed by UNICEF. "For every one of us 
working, we are keeping maybe 10 or 15 people alive. We would be destroyed if 
the U.N. left." 
</P>
<P>
 By virtue of its 380,000 residents, Sarajevo might survive even a seriously 
escalated artillery assault by the Serbs long enough for reinforcements to make 
their way from allied Croatia's Adriatic Sea coast. If the capital's defenders 
were to hold out until the Muslim-Croatian alliance in central Bosnia and the 
reasonably well-supplied troops in the Tuzla region to the north could come to 
their rescue, an infusion of heavy weapons and supportive Muslim warriors could 
turn the war's tide in the beleaguered government's favor. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the underdog-wins scenario is fraught with perilous consequences for 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
 As one U.N. official here observed with a sigh of hopelessness: "The only 
thing worse than an undeterred victory for the Serbs might be their defeat, in 
which case they would have fresh grievances to war over ad infinitum." More on

THE WEEK AHEAD: VATICAN CITY; RITES OF THE SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the annual celebration of Christmastide, Pope John Paul II will conduct the 
traditional Mass on Sunday morning at St. Peter's, the largest church in 
Christendom, in the midst of a busy weekend of activities. Later that day, 
speaking from the central balcony of St. Peter's, the Roman Catholic pontiff 
will deliver his annual blessing entitled "Urbi et Orbi," or "To the City and 
the World." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope's seasonal ceremonies commence on Thursday when he tenders Christmas 
greetings to the cardinals, the pontifical family and the Curia at the Sala 
Clementina of the Apostolic Palace of the Vatican. At midnight Saturday, he 
will conduct the midnight Mass at St. Peter's, at the altar where only a Pope 
can say Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Polish-born John Paul is the first non-Italian Pope in 4 1/2 centuries.

THE MEDIA; ZUT ALORS! FRENCH 'VOICES' FALL SILENT IN DUBBERS STRIKE; THE ACTORS 
WHO PUT TRANSLATED WORDS INTO U.S. STARS' MOUTHS DEMAND PAY FOR REBROADCAST OF 
PROGRAMS IN FRANCE. 
</P>

<P>
 In real life, Daniel Beretta is a stocky, blue-eyed guy with long, thick blond 
hair and the beginnings of a paunch. He plays the piano, sings French ballads 
and does some acting, though he labors mostly in obscurity. 
</P>
<P>
 But millions of French moviegoers would recognize Beretta instantly, without 
laying eyes on him, as the muscled voice of Arnold Schwarzenegger in half a 
dozen films over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 And for Beretta and 800 other French actors, the process of putting their 
words in the mouths of America's top movie stars is the most challenging acting 
assignment of all. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the toughest of jobs to be someone else's voice, but I just love to play 
Schwarzenegger," Beretta said, smiling as he held his 2-year-old daughter in 
his Paris apartment. "There's, like, a spark. I feel I know him. We have a 
parallel life. I'm sure he's a good guy, with a lot of heart." 
</P>
<P>
 But these days, the voices of France's skillful dubbers, or doubleurs as they 
are called here, have fallen silent in the studios and are instead being raised 
in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 They have launched a massive strike, now in its ninth week, to press their 
demand to be paid for the rebroadcast of films, TV programs and series in which 
they performed. The strike centers on a 1985 French law guaranteeing actors and 
other performing artists the right to be paid for all residual sales of their 
work. The distribution companies argue that dubbers are "extras," not 
performing artists, and therefore are not covered by the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The distributors of films and TV programs "have insulted us," said Alain 
Dorval, a rugged, dark-haired 48-year-old who has been Sylvester Stallone's 
gravelly French voice since the first "Rocky" in 1976. "This is about our 
dignity, and dignity can't be shared." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the dubbers have begun using their special skills in an ingenious radio 
appeal for public sympathy. In one advertising spot, the well-known French 
voice of Peter Falk's Columbo asks the voice of "Monsieur Eliot Ness" how he 
can tell his wife what the strike is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 After being told that everyone involved in the film receives residuals except 
the dubbers, Columbo responds with all the sincerity of the beloved, rumpled 
detective. "That's not right," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The man behind Columbo's French voice, Serge Sauvion, is an institution in 
France, where episodes of the TV series still play regularly. In his career, 
the 66-year-old French actor has done the voices of TV tough guys Mike Hammer 
and Baretta as well as roles played by Richard Burton, Sidney Poitier and 
Montgomery Clift. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've dubbed the Columbo series for 25 years, but each time I was only paid 
once," complained Sauvion. "This fight of ours is going to last as long as it 
takes to win." 
</P>
<P>
 The strike already has disrupted the television dubbing of dozens of American 
soap operas and series, and delays now are expected in getting them onto the 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, film distributors say the strike has not greatly affected them. BAC 
Films, which is distributing the new Woody Allen film, "Bullets Over Broadway," 
had the French-language script written before the strike and has managed to 
finish the dubbing with strike-breakers and foreign actors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you how we've done it," a spokesman for BAC said. "But it was 
legal." 
</P>
<P>
 The French government, fearing that the strike will severely disrupt 
television programming and hurt striking actors, has called in a mediator. But 
the television and film distributors have thus far refused to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the two sides, Culture Minister Jacques Toubon said he believes 
that the law clearly was intended to include dubbers as "performing artists." 
But he added that a final decision would rest with the nation's judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbing is big business in France, where American films and TV programs make 
up well over half the entertainment fare. For the French viewer, everyone from 
Tom Hanks to Julia Roberts speaks French. And the unions representing the 
dubbers say 85% of American entertainment revenue here comes from dubbed TV 
programs and films. 
</P>
<P>
 In French cinemas, foreign films usually are released in both their "original 
version," with French subtitles, and a "French version," in which dialogue is 
dubbed. 
</P>
<P>
 For mainstream pictures, such as "Sister Act," and animated films, such as 
"The Lion King," about 90% of box-office revenue comes from the French version. 
But for other pictures, such as Woody Allen films, which many French moviegoers 
prefer to see in their original version, only about half the receipts come from 
the French version. 
</P>
<P>
 It costs between $70,000 and $150,000 to dub an American movie in France, not 
including the cost of translating the script. The standard union scale for 
dubbing actors is $6.50 a line, or about $2,000 for a leading role, and it 
usually involves a week or 10 days of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbers with voices that are well-known, or associated with the actors on 
screen, can command higher salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorval made $1,000 for dubbing Stallone in the first "Rocky" movie. But, for 
the last in the series, he demanded and received $10,000. His salary dipped 
again with the recent "Cliffhanger," for which he received $5,000 to dub 
Stallone. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most dubbers work in anonymity, a few say they are recognized by 
their voices in restaurants and on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young people really identify with me as Stallone," Dorval said. "People are 
always asking me to do the last line of 'Rocky.' They say: 'Do Adrian for me!' 
"  
</P>
<P>
 With that, Dorval broke into a warbling "AAAAddddriaaaaan!" As if to 
apologize, he added: "It's a very celebrated cry in France." 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbing has been around since the end of the silent film era. While it has 
never been especially popular in the United States, it is an integral part of 
the movie business in Europe, primarily because of Hollywood's huge market 
share there. 
</P>
<P>
 It's big business, and distributors in France are understandably reluctant to 
hand over a portion of their proceeds for rebroadcasts and re-screenings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dubbing in France is more expensive than anywhere else in the world," said 
Jean Labadie, general manager of BAC, which has distributed "Short Cuts," "Pulp 
Fiction" and other recent U.S. films in France. "These people are very well 
paid. I don't feel these are poor people living on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a market," Labadie added. "And there is no reason that everybody 
should get a percentage all the time, unless the film is being sold by their 
name and their voice." 
</P>
<P>
 But the three unions representing the dubbers in France disagree, pointing out 
that writers of dubbed dialogue are paid each time the show or film appears. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want them to recognize us as actors, with the right to authorize the use 
of our work all the way down the line," said Jimmy Shulman, a leader of the 
Syndicate of French Performing Artists, the largest actors union in France. 
</P>
<P>
 "These distributors have the money," Shulman added. "But we haven't even 
talked about figures yet. We're still stuck on questions of principle." 
</P>
<P>
 The actors say the key to successful dubbing is to put themselves into the 
image on the screen and make the audience forget, as soon as possible, that 
they aren't hearing the actor's real voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that's not always easy. One problem is regional American accents. 
In France, when an American actor appears on screen with a Texas twang, the 
French dubber gives him a non-Parisian accent, to distinguish him from the rest 
of the cast. 
</P>
<P>
 The other problem is French accents in American movies. Beretta, the French 
Schwarzenegger, solved the problem of playing the voice of Lumiere, the 
French-accented candelabra in "Beauty and the Beast" by putting on the 
sophisticated accent of the late Maurice Chevalier. 
</P>
<P>
 With some roles, such as Columbo, simple mimicry works nicely, and a casual 
viewer might easily believe Sauvion is Falk's long-lost French cousin. 
Similarly, Bernard Murat does Woody Allen as a very believable, whiny 
Frenchman. 
</P>
<P>
 Beretta got his first Schwarzenegger job when a producer overheard him 
speaking in a television studio. But Beretta's Schwarzenegger voice has evolved 
from the tough, East European accent of the actor in "Red Heat" to a lighter, 
almost feminine tone in "Junior," in which the actor plays a man who becomes 
pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 Some distributors have rotated the voice roles of major actors, weighing the 
potential for audience reaction against the potential for increased wage 
demands from dubbers too closely associated with one actor. For instance, there 
are two French Kevin Costners and two Whoopi Goldbergs, and many actors have 
done Jack Nicholson's voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being an actor means being another person, but to be a dubber you have to 
play an actor who is playing another person," said Jacqueline Cohen, a 
deep-voiced 59-year-old who has played the French voice of Goldberg in "Jumping 
Jack Flash," "The Player" and "Sarafina." 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't make people on the street do this job," she added. "It's 
impossible. You have to be an actor, and you have to have a certain technique." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Cohen is a white woman doing the voice of a black actress, she said 
she finds the biggest compliment comes "when people say they've seen one of my 
Whoopi Goldberg films and didn't recognize me." 
</P>
<P>
 For most French dubbers, the job is part-time. As the French film industry has 
atrophied, jobs for actors have dwindled. And dubbing is a way to supplement 
their income from writing, stage acting or television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen, for example, spends most of her time writing dubbed dialogue. She has 
written the French scripts and subtitles for all of Woody Allen's films, 
including "Bullets Over Broadway." And she fondly remembers an exchange last 
year with Allen, who is probably America's most popular filmmaker in France. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've made a hero of me in France," he told Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," she responded, "you've made a hero of me." 
</P>
<P>

 Christians who travel to the birthplace of Jesus to celebrate the traditional 
Holy Week midnight Mass on Saturday will find Manger Square, outside the Church 
of the Nativity, bedecked with more Palestinian flags than Christmas trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli army still occupies the West Bank, but the government has handed 
over certain areas of civilian life, including tourism, to the 
Palestinians.Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij, the Palestinian Authority's minister 
of tourism, is determined to make this Christmas a Palestinian one. The city 
has ordered 2,000 Palestinian flags to festoon Manger Square and other 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Fatah -- the once-outlawed Palestinian guerrilla faction -- has gotten into 
the holiday spirit by placing a Christmas tree and a Santa Claus on the balcony 
outside its Bethlehem office.

 Loyalists plan a rally Wednesday in Gori, Josef Stalin's hometown in Georgia, 
to mark the 115th anniversary of his birth.The Soviet dictator was born Josef 
Dzugashvili in a one-room brick and wood shack on the southern slopes of the 
Caucasus Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Stalinists, mostly aging Communists who pine for a restoration of something

CHANGING LIFESTYLES; S. AFRICA NOT RUSHING TO OBLITERATE SYMBOLS OF APARTHEID; 
MANDELA'S GOVERNMENT FOCUSES ON SOCIAL CHANGE, FORGOING THE COSMETIC SURGERY OF 
REMOVING MONUMENTS TO WHITE RULE. 
</P>

 In a caustic comic strip, "Madam and Eve," aliens in a flying saucer 
threatened to nuke South Africa because they could find no changes since their 
last visit to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've made lots of improvements!" Madam quickly protests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Such as?" the spacething asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, we have a new president. . . . We have a new flag. . . . We have . . . 
uh, we have . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 That's not quite fair. Nelson Mandela is no slouch in the president 
department; the world's most famous prisoner has become perhaps its most 
acclaimed leader. And the flag, initially ridiculed for its "Y-front" design, 
as seen in men's underwear, is now proudly emblazoned on ties, T-shirts and 
bumper stickers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the new government has yet to deliver many new jobs, homes or other 
tangible benefits to South Africa's black majority seven months after the 
advent of democratic rule. But it's a Herculean task, there are limited 
resources, and at least the process has begun. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been a titanic shift in attitudes here, one that translates into a 
new culture in a country still struggling to shed a past tarred with the stigma 
of institutionalized racist oppression. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most obvious change is what now seems a kind of general amnesia. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to find anybody now who ever supported apartheid," said Gordon 
Metz, coordinator of the Mayibuye Center, a cultural institute, at the 
University of the Western Cape. 
</P>
<P>
 The interim constitution of the new South Africa mandates racial equality and 
respect for human rights. It is so determined to protect all citizens that it 
bans discrimination against both "sex" and "gender," a legal distinction that 
no one seems able to explain. 
</P>
<P>
 Other changes, while perhaps more symbolic, seem equally dramatic. For 
instance, after decades of forced isolation and economic sanctions, the 
government will receive Queen Elizabeth of Britain, South Africa's former 
colonial ruler, next spring. She's expected to confer a knighthood on Mandela. 
The Rolling Stones are coming. So are thousands of bankers, tourists and 
diplomats; more than 100 new embassies have opened, turning provincial Pretoria 
into an almost cosmopolitan city. 
</P>
<P>
 The country now has 11 official languages. So a popular Friday night TV soap 
opera called "Generations" features black actors speaking Zulu, Xhosa, Tswana, 
Sotho and other African tongues, with subtitles for the linguistically 
challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 Political violence is down sharply, and township associations are fixing up 
and reoccupying homes ravaged by urban wars. One group of township 
warriors-turned-entrepreneurs has opened a tourist bureau in Tokoza, hoping to 
lure overseas visitors to the rubble-strewn streets of the infamous slum 
outside Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Johannesburg's new MuseumAfrica has set up a display of political signs, 
squatters' shacks, bars and other aspects of township life, an anthropological 
look at how the majority of people still live. It's striking because other 
museums, and South African school books for that matter, have ignored black 
life and black contributions until now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blacks have been alienated from museums in the past," said the curator, 
Kerrie Shepherd Nkosi. "This exhibit reaffirms black history and gives 
recognition to that history. You must remember that, until recently, black 
people weren't allowed to walk in the door." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Mandela's attempts to reconcile the nation and to avoid a right-wing 
backlash have limited the reactions one might expect first after a political 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, tearing down or renaming icons of the past has been minimal. 
Except for a highway in Pretoria now called Nelson Mandela Boulevard, none of 
the hundreds of cities, airports, military bases, town squares or other public 
facilities named for the heroes of white supremacy have been renamed for 
Mandela or the other heroes of the liberation struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela has nixed attempts to erect busts or statues of him, saying the money 
should go instead to schools, clinics and other public programs. He has 
criticized those who propose destroying Afrikaner monuments, or widespread name 
changes of public properties, as happened after the collapse of white rule 
elsewhere in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly as a result, only one statue has fallen so far. In September, 
provincial officials in the Afrikaner stronghold of Bloemfontein ordered the 
removal of a huge statue of Hendrik F. Verwoerd, the architect of apartheid and 
father of the South African police state. Jubilant blacks danced on the fallen 
figure after it was winched from its pedestal outside the provincial offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The removal provoked an uproar. Armed Afrikaners marched on Bloemfontein to 
demand the statue be replaced on its foundation. Even Mandela criticized the 
move, saying greater "consultation" should have been used to avoid an 
impression of vindictiveness. So far the statue has not been replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Verwoerd's name and brooding marble bust were removed from an office 
building in the Parliament complex at Pretoria. Fittingly, perhaps, dark 
shadows remain on the granite facade where his name once hung in brass letters. 
</P>
<P>
 But those are exceptions. Verwoerdburg, a wealthy Pretoria suburb, remains 
Verwoerdburg. And those few places that have changed names so far have mostly 
been given African names used by indigenous people before the whites took over. 
Thus residents in the wealthy province that includes both Johannesburg and 
Pretoria discovered in early December that they were now living in Gauteng, the 
Sotho word for "place of gold." 
</P>
<P>
 While one white legislator complained Gauteng sounded like a disease, most 
agreed that it was a vast improvement on the old provincial name, 
"Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereenigeng," usually simply shortened to PWV. It was, 
in fact, the sheer heft of that name that led to the change, not politics. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen dams named for pro-apartheid leaders were also renamed, but all were 
given traditional African names for rivers, valleys and other local features, 
not for black leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 But the portraits of white autocrats who made white supremacy the law of the 
land still glower in the halls of Parliament. Nearby hang unflattering 
19th-Century watercolors of minstrel-like blacks drinking, dancing and 
sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Nico Smit, a Parliament spokesman, said a proposal to take down the pictures 
was still pending before the household committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The minister has decided they will consult wide and deep and all over before 
they do anything," Smit said. "Everybody realizes the sensitivity of these 
things."

CULTURE; ROTHSCHILD: A DYNASTY DIVERSIFIED; A MUSEUM EXHIBIT SHOWS THE 
CENTURIES-OLD BANKING FAMILY AS PROTOTYPE OF EUROPEAN UNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When 20-year-old Meyer Amschel Rothschild set up a coin exchange in this 
city's Jewish ghetto in the 1760s, an enterprise that would launch a family 
dynasty and turn the Rothschild name into a symbol of wealth and power, Germany 
was still a century away from unity and Europe had many fratricidal wars ahead 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rothschild patriarch established the prototype of modern capitalism. Early 
on, he and the five sons he brought into his banking business grasped the need 
for rapid communications and good public relations, the value of diversified 
investments and vertical integration. Most important, they understood that 
their market was not just the hundreds of sovereign principalities surrounding 
Frankfurt but all of Europe and beyond.

 Meyer Amschel fought for Jewish civil rights and never moved from Frankfurt's 
Jews' Lane, but he certainly saw the wisdom in doing so and sent his sons out 
to 19th-Century Europe's commercial capitals -- London, Paris, Vienna and 
Naples -- to expand the family business. 
</P>
<P>
 Naysayers of European unity today might do well to visit "The Rothschilds," an 
exhibit subtitled "A European Family" at Frankfurt's Jewish Museum, to see just 
how little is new in the idea of European economic integration and how long it 
has been in place. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rothschild family business transcended national borders and was, as 
Munich's Suddeutsche Zeitung concluded in a review of the exhibit, "the first 
European banking multinational." 
</P>
<P>
 Even today, the Rothschilds are influential players in European financial 
circles, though not at the level of a century ago. The banks, investment 
companies and foundation that bear the family's name are grouped under 
Swiss-based holding companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Primary operations, still in the hands of Rothschild descendants, are based in 
London and Paris, with the English branch under the command of Sir Evelyn de 
Rothschild, a staunch member of Britain's patrician society, and his cousin 
Jacob, who is more business-oriented, struggling to modernize the Rothschild 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rothschild Bank "really seems like a boutique merchant bank. Small, 
specialist, carries with it the weight of history. It is not as deal-driven as 
U.K. or American merchant banks," said a London banker, speaking on condition 
of anonymity. "It has a reputation for having well-placed contacts in the 
government, but even that is somewhat historical." 
</P>
<P>
 The history of Europe in the 19th Century cannot be told without mentioning 
the Rothschilds. The family's story begins in the Jewish ghetto, where the 
Rothschild name comes from the sign on the family's original home -- a Rotes 
Schild, or Red Shield. When Meyer Amschel was born in the Judengasse 250 years 
ago, it was a walled neighborhood with gates that were locked at nights, on 
Sundays and Roman Catholic holidays to prevent Jews from leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer Amschel set up his coin business at home in about 1764, and five years 
later he acquired the title of court agent to the minor Court of Hesse-Hanau, 
which allowed him relatively free travel without all of the levies normally 
applied to Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 He diversified from the start, simultaneously selling antiques, buying bills 
of exchange and working as an agent procuring loans. With a penchant for 
innovation, Meyer Amschel set up what amounted to a mail-order business in 
valuable coins. 
</P>
<P>
 Wars generally offer capitalists opportunities for profit, and the conflicts 
of the late 18th Century were no exception for the Rothschilds. They financed 
troops of the Elector of Hanau, which fought with the British against the 
United States; Austria's Imperial Army in its wars with the French; and, later, 
British troops in the Napoleonic Wars. 
</P>
<P>
 With their early war profits, the Rothschilds moved into the Jewish 
community's highest tax bracket and expanded their business into English cloth 
and groceries and the new trade in state bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 By the turn of the 19th Century, Meyer Amschel had several court agent titles, 
but modern states were replacing principalities throughout Europe, and with 
them a modern banking sector was developing. The family saw that it too had to 
move forward. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1799, Meyer Amschel's third son, Nathan, left Frankfurt for England, then 
the world's center of industry and trade. Nathan first moved to Manchester to 
set up Rothschild Bros., a wholesale company that bought cloth, had it dyed and 
printed and shipped it to his father's company and other customers on the 
Continent. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathan Rothschild made big profits in the beginning of the Napoleonic Wars, 
circumventing the Continental blockade against trade between Britain and states 
under French rule. But as the blockade tightened, he abandoned the cloth trade 
in favor of banking and stockbroking in London. 
</P>
<P>
 He founded the London bank N.M. Rothschild & Sons, and over the next decade, 
his brothers James, Salomon and Carl fanned across Europe to set up branches in 
Paris, Vienna and Naples, respectively. The eldest brother, Amschel, eventually 
took over Bankhaus M.A. Rothschild & Soehne from his father in Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer Amschel believed that success lay in unity. In 1810, he formed a formal 
partnership with his five sons, called Mayer Amschel Rothschild & Soehne, that 
was meant to promote the family over its individual members and to keep its 
wealth together as long as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The strict contract stipulated that the company could not be dissolved for 10 
years, that each son was paid an allowance but otherwise all capital was to 
remain in the firm, and that no partner could make a deal without agreement 
from the others. It also excluded Meyer Amschel's five daughters and all 
daughters-in-law from any interest in the family firm or fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer Amschel died two years later, leaving a family united in wealth and 
confidence, and on the threshold of becoming one of the most important in 
19th-Century Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never doubted that we would become Europe's richest men," James, who had 
changed his name from Jakob after leaving Frankfurt, once wrote from Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers maintained the family's Jewish tradition but also understood that 
it was a political disadvantage to overcome. They built palaces that they 
decorated in the style of the French aristocracy, threw grand weddings that 
became media events and set lavish tables for Europe's high society. Soon they 
petitioned the government of Austria to be made nobles -- Austria being the 
only country at the time that would give titles to Jews -- and in 1816, with a 
considerable family fortune, they became the von Rothschilds. 
</P>
<P>
 "They realized it was important for moving into the European upper crust of 
society," said Annette Weber, curator of arts at the Jewish Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 But the family's quick ascent from the Judengasse into Europe's elite made the 
Rothschilds a continuous target of anti-Semitism, which they sought to counter 
with charitable works and their own public relations campaigns. A lithograph of 
the five sons with the family motto integritas, concordia, industria was 
mass-produced and hung in Rothschild banks, as well as distributed to clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next five years, the Rothschild Bank outdistanced its competition to 
become the leading bank in Europe. It continued to profit in a highly 
competitive market for government bonds while doing business with most of 
Europe's social elite.  
</P>
<P>
 Part of the family's recipe for success was a fast and efficient family 
communication system -- a prototype fax and computer system, one might say, 
made up of daily letters, a network of information agents throughout Britain 
and the Continent, and carrier pigeons. 
</P>
<P>
 Brother Salomon expanded the family business to railroads in Austria at a time 
when many people still feared that the arrival of trains would stop cows from 
giving milk. From there, he moved into ironworks, coal mining and locomotive 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 The family entered into insurance and oil exploration and financed Britain's 
purchase of the Suez Canal. The Rothschilds increased their political contacts 
and involvement, with Nathan's son, Lionel, becoming the first Jewish member of 
the British Parliament in 1858. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankfurt remained the family nucleus until Gulte Rothschild, mother of the 
five sons, died in 1849 at the age of 96, still residing in the Judengasse.  
</P>
<P>
 By the turn of the 20th Century, with no male heir in place, the family closed 
its Frankfurt bank and concentrated its interests in Britain and France, where 
today the family is headed, respectively, by Lord Jacob Rothschild and Baron 
Guy de Rothschild, who is nearly as renowned for wine as for banking. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Rothschild banks have branches in 20 countries and, once again, in 
Frankfurt, where the Paris bank opened a branch in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nazis managed to wipe out most traces of the Rothschilds in Frankfurt, but 
at least one monument remains: the weekend villa of Mayer Carl Rothschild -- 
grandson of patriarch Meyer Amschel -- which now houses the city's Jewish 
Museum and its latest exhibit on the Rothschilds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankfurt is just now starting to recognize the Rothschild family as one of 
our own," Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in fact, as her exhibit shows, the Rothschilds belonged to Europe.

<P>
 A month ago, a bloody showdown between Palestinian police and Islamic 
militants threatened to plunge the Gaza Strip into civil war. Now the soothing 
slap of brushes painting over factional graffiti has replaced the crack of 
gunfire in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The whitewashed slogans are the first tangible results of an intense, ongoing 
mediation effort launched by Israeli Arabs just hours after the Nov. 18 clash 
erupted outside a Gaza mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by an unlikely pair -- a secular gynecologist from Jerusalem and a leader 
of the Islamic movement inside Israel -- Israeli Arabs stepped to the fore as 
mediators between Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority and his most powerful 
opposition, the militant Islamic movement Hamas. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, each side welcomed their intervention, Israeli Arabs claimed, 
because they were not members of any faction represented in the West Bank and 
Gaza but had familial and political ties there that only Palestinians could 
have. "It was only natural," said Dr. Ahmed Tibi, the Jerusalem gynecologist 
who serves as spokesman for the mediation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Tibi and other mediators say their efforts helped defuse an explosive 
situation in Gaza -- at least 14 people were killed and 129 injured during the 
Nov. 18 confrontation -- and laid the groundwork for reconciliation between the 
Palestinian Authority and Hamas. 
</P>
<P>
 But now they find that both Palestinians and Israelis view their efforts with 
suspicion. Israeli officials have publicly questioned the loyalties of Israeli 
Arabs. Palestinians in the territories are accusing them of taking sides in the 
political tug-of-war between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, the nascent 
government established to administer the Jericho and Gaza areas after Israel 
and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed their historic peace accord in 
September, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general, the connection between Arab citizens of Israel should be 
welcomed, when it is in relation to economic development of the territories and 
of Israel," said Shimon Shetreet, Israel's minister of economics and planning. 
"But when it is in the political area, when Israeli Arabs get involved in the 
conflicts between the Palestinian groups, it is not welcomed by the Israeli 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 There are 900,000 Israeli Arabs, many of whom prefer to call themselves 
Palestinians who hold Israeli citizenship. They live inside Israel's pre-1967 
borders, and vote in its elections. But their status has always been ambiguous. 
They are exempted from the mandatory army duty required of all other Israelis. 
Their connections with other Palestinians have been regarded as a potential 
security risk by successive Israeli governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Israeli Arabs say they are finding that the Palestinian factions they are 
dealing with in Gaza are uneasy with the mediators' Israeli citizenship and 
skeptical of their neutrality in intra-Palestinian conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is difficult because, even if one side presents a solution that you feel 
is logical, the other side will point a finger and accuse you of being 
partial," said Taleb a-Sanaa, an Israeli Arab who is a member of the Knesset, 
Israel's Parliament. "It is very easy to be dragged into factional politics." 
</P>
<P>
 Successful mediation efforts in Gaza may pay off for Israeli Arab leaders with 
their constituents in the next elections, but the intervention is exacting an 
immediate price. 
</P>
<P>
 "Israel always wanted us to be a bridge for peace, a bridge to the other 
Palestinians and the other Arabs," said Hashem Mahmeed, a Knesset member with 
the pro-Communist Democratic Front for Peace and Equality. "Now that we are 
trying to be that bridge, they say that we shouldn't. Well, we are not asking 
for anyone's permission." 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent Israeli Cabinet meeting, security officials warned that the 
mediation efforts by Israeli Arabs in Gaza could pose a security risk for 
Israel. Leaks of the warning infuriated Israeli Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an irresponsible and shallow thing to say," Mahmeed said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not so much the mediation effort per se that worries people," explained 
a senior Israeli security official, speaking on condition of anonymity. "It is 
the much, much larger picture of what is happening to Israeli Arabs, now that 
the sulta (Palestinian Authority) is operating." 
</P>
<P>
 If their mediating efforts manage to serve as a unifying force among the 
always-fractious Israeli Arab politicians, the security official said, they 
could decide to form a single party and run on one ticket for the next 
parliamentary elections. If all of Israel's Arabs voted for one Arab party, it 
could capture as many as 14 seats in the 120-seat Knesset. That would be a big 
enough bloc to affect coalition building and decide crucial votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, there are only seven Israeli Arab Knesset members. Two ran on 
Jewish Zionist party lists. No Israeli prime minister has ever included an Arab 
party in his or her governing coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Israeli Arabs say openly that they believe a larger Arab presence in 
the Knesset will help the Palestinian entity now being born in Gaza and the 
West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arafat is interested in having a large Arab representation in the Knesset 
that would have an effect in the Palestinian arena as well," said Ibrahim 
Sarsour, a member of the local council in Kfar Kassem, an Israeli Arab village. 
Sarsour is a member of the Islamic movement inside Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as the Jews are interested in having as large a number of Jews as 
possible in both houses of (the U.S.) Congress, we are interested in having a 
large number of Arabs in the Knesset," Sarsour said. The Islamic movement is a 
growing force within the Israeli Arab political arena. Islamists decided to run 
for municipal councils and are now influential in several key Arab cities. But 
the movement has yet to sanction the participation of Islamic candidates in 
national elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Tibi, the physician-mediator, is openly toying with the notion of joining 
forces with Sheik Abdallah Nimr Darwish, a cleric with contacts to Hamas 
leaders, and running in the next parliamentary elections. He seems to enjoy the 
controversy stirred inside Israel by both his mediating efforts and his 
potential candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not the usual Israeli citizens," said Tibi, brushing off criticism 
from those Israelis who say he and the other mediators too closely identify 
with the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza. "We are different. I do not 
use the term 'Israeli Arab.' I am a Palestinian who holds Israeli citizenship. 
Before any other label, I am a Palestinian." 
</P>
<P>
 Fluent in Hebrew as well as Arabic and English, he served as a go-between for 
Arafat with Israeli officials and as a public spokesman for Arafat inside 
Israel years before Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's government decided 
to recognize the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 18, the day of the Gaza shootings, Arafat called on Tibi to act as a 
mediator shortly after rioting erupted outside Gaza's main mosque. There were 
running gun battles between Arafat's police and Islamic militants in the 
streets of Gaza. Casualties were mounting, and Hamas leaders were warning that 
the Palestinian Authority was flirting with civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything could have blown up in our faces," Tibi recalled. "The tension was 
increasing, and it was a very dangerous situation." Tibi asked Darwish to come 
with him to Gaza and negotiate an immediate cease-fire. Darwish agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We called for an emergency meeting in President Arafat's office," Darwish 
recalled in a telephone interview. "We sat until 3:30 a.m." The meeting 
produced a temporary cease-fire and an agreement that funerals would proceed 
peacefully on Saturday, the day after the clash. It became known as the 
Darwish-Tibi agreement and served as the basis for ongoing negotiations between 
Hamas and the Palestinian Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Their joint intervention earned Tibi and Darwish the mocking title of "the 
yuppie and the priest" from Israeli Arab politicians alarmed by the clout a 
potential political partnership between the two could have with Israeli Arab 
voters in the next elections. A recent survey by an Israeli polling 
organization said, if the two were to form a political party, it could garner 
as many as four Knesset seats in the next election. The only current all-Arab 
party, the Arab Democracy Party, now holds two seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The next big test for Tibi and Darwish will be whether they can expand the 
temporary cease-fire between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority into a broader 
political agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas leader Mahmoud Zahhar recently complained that the mediation efforts 
have flagged and that little of substance has been achieved. Their continuation 
appeared shaky. The fundamental differences between the Palestinian Authority 
and Hamas remain, and it is hard to see how Tibi and Darwish will bridge them. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas remains violently opposed to the accords that led to the peace agreement 
and established the Palestinian self-governing authority. The militants are 
committed to torpedoing the agreement by whatever means are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tibi said he is still optimistic about the negotiations. Talks will resume 
before the end of the month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will organize an agenda to discuss all the disagreements, to discuss how 
to run this entity, even when there are disagreements," Tibi said. "Ultimately, 
Hamas can participate in the system functionally. It is only natural."

DOCUMENTARY; GETTING TO REBEL CHECHNYA IS A BATTLE IN ITSELF; A CORRESPONDENT 
RUNS INTO ROADBLOCKS TRYING TO COVER CONFLICT IN THE CAUCASUS -- AND ALSO A 
CUNNING TAXI DRIVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The captain at the roadside militia post studied our press credentials and 
phoned his superior. As we waited, truckers and farmers breezed through the 
checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Half an hour later, he lied to us: "There's a crowd of armed people ahead. For 
your own safety, I cannot let you through." 
</P>
<P>
 The captain, a cheerful, stocky little man with a Kalashnikov rifle and 
bulletproof vest, was just one of a string of obstacles on the way from Moscow 
to Grozny, the capital of tiny, secessionist Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a 1,000-mile journey that should take two hours by air. 
</P>
<P>
 But here in the Caucasus Mountains, distance and time have a way of expanding 
to frustrate the finest of Moscow's calculations, the grandest of imperial 
designs. Even for an unarmed Moscow correspondent, getting to Grozny is an 
unpredictable ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Czarist armies needed three centuries to bring this turbulent region to heel. 
Now, after seven decades of Russian monarchy and seven decades of "scientific 
socialism," the Caucasus is again a caldron of ethnic unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was a historic event when thousands of Russian troops moved into heavily 
armed Chechnya to try to crush the oil-rich Muslim republic's self-declared 
independence. Awakened by the news early on Dec. 11, I fretted over the odds of 
reaching Grozny ahead of the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 The Itar-Tass news bulletin said three tank columns began converging on the 
city at 7 a.m., from 40 to 60 miles away, at speeds up to 12 m.p.h. At that 
rate. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I rushed to the airport with Sergei Loiko, a Russian reporter for The Times. A 
Russian blockade had halted flights to Grozny since August. The nearest we 
could land was Mineralniye Vody, a Russian city 190 miles to the northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 By 5 p.m., an intrepid taxi driver named Ruslan had agreed to take us in his 
big black Volga. Grozny was four hours away, but he warned: "I cannot guarantee 
we'll get there." 
</P>
<P>
 We arrived at 5 the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way was a maze of roadblocks in three tiny republics, each guarded 
by police, vigilantes and assorted gunmen, each with its own foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The militia captain who turned us back in the Russian republic of 
Kabardino-Balkaria was taking orders from someone in Moscow who didn't want 
reporters to witness the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ruslan found a way around -- a two-hour trek on muddy back roads across 
moonlit collective farms -- and on to the next ministate, Ingushetia, where the 
first police roadblock was pro-Chechen. 
</P>
<P>
 There, Lt. Bekhan Korigov offered help arranging VIP clearance through every 
checkpoint to the Chechen border. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Russians enter Grozny, the Ingush, the Kabards, the Balkars, the 
Cherkessians -- all the Caucasus peoples -- will rise up, and that will be the 
end of Russia," the lieutenant declared. "You'll see." 
</P>
<P>
 But where were the Russians? Hadn't they already entered Grozny? 
</P>
<P>
 Not yet. Moscow's biggest tank offensive since the Afghan War was meeting far 
more resistance than Ruslan's Volga. The story of the week was not the storming 
of Grozny but the bogging down of a huge military machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Before we could begin to find out why this was happening, it was first 
necessary to check out of that death trap of a hotel in Grozny where we had 
stupidly crashed after 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The other guests turned out to be out-of-town guerrillas -- Muslims lured from 
places like Afghanistan and Syria to wage holy war against Slavs, and Slavs 
from Ukraine with their own national grievances against the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a multinational snipers' nest with no food, heat or water. An Islamic 
Rambo juggled a hand grenade in the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came here to defend Ukrainian and Chechen freedom," boasted Sasha, a beefy 
blond with a Kalashnikov rifle, a Los Angeles Raiders jacket and a Miami 
Dolphins cap turned backward on his head. 
</P>
<P>
 The first resistance to Col. Ivan Gromov's tank column came not from 
mercenaries like Sasha but from 150 Chechen farmers. Leaving their guns home, 
they milled around in the road where his tanks had stopped 20 miles northeast 
of Grozny. 
</P>
<P>
 Gromov, a veteran of other ethnic conflicts around Russia's edge, is a man who 
knows his limits. He took us aside, away from the crowd, which, perhaps because 
of our presence, had started shouting at the Russians to go home. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mission is to disarm the Chechens, but I'm not going to risk my men's 
lives doing it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be careful even how you talk with these people," he added. "They 
are Muslims. A drunken Chechen harassed me, but I couldn't tell him he was 
drunk because drinking is against his religion and he would have felt grossly 
insulted." 
</P>
<P>
 The tanks were full of other Russian officers and soldiers who didn't want to 
offend the Chechens' sensibilities. Or spill their blood. Or die in their holy 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 So after a week of fog, peaceful and armed Chechen resistance, and wavering 
Russian will, the columns stopped short of Grozny. Finally, the Russian high 
command resorted to bomb and artillery strikes on the city's edges. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eye of the storm, on the ninth floor of his presidential palace, sat 
Gen. Dzhokar M. Dudayev, the leader of Chechnya's independence movement. Could 
I interview him? 
</P>
<P>
 "That depends on whether you voted for Bill Clinton," said Dudayev's press 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Huh? 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that the American president had irritated the renegade Chechen by 
dismissing his independence war as an "internal Russian problem." 
</P>
<P>
 I had been intrigued, even before coming to work in Moscow, by Dudayev's folk 
hero status in the little nations under Russia's neo-imperial thumb, his 
railing against Kremlin "cynicism, vandalism, barbarism and satanism," his 
threats to blow up Russian nuclear power plants. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eventual interview, the rebel general sounded almost smug about the 
Russian siege of Grozny, a decrepit and lawless city that's a haven for arms 
traffickers, drug dealers, counterfeiters and car thieves. He had drawn the 
Russian bear into a quagmire, he said, from which it cannot easily advance nor 
retreat. "We have achieved a brilliant victory. Now Russia's problems will grow 
in geometric proportions." 
</P>
<P>
 When time came to leave Chechnya, I was amazed at the ease of the journey. No 
roadblocks, no checkpoints, no tanks. Our taxi averaged 50 m.p.h. to 
Makhachkala, the nearest airport east of Dudayev's republic. 
</P>
<P>
 I wondered how long it would take the Russians.

 U.S. and Belgian flags fluttered from every building along the main street of 
this small market town in the heart of Belgium's picturesque Ardennes hills. 
</P>
<P>
 From temporary loudspeakers, Glen Miller's "In the Mood" wafted along the 
thoroughfare, riding on an icy late autumn wind. Metal crowd barriers lined the 
sidewalks, and television crews prepared for the parade. 
</P>
<P>
 In an hour, a few hundred U.S. veterans and a handful of Belgian comrades 
would march through a freezing rain to the cheers of local residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Another World War II 50th anniversary was unfolding.

 This time, on Friday, the commemoration marked the beginning of the monthlong 
Battle of the Bulge, a bitter engagement that military historians describe as 
both the U.S. Army's single biggest battle of the war and "the last act of the 
great liberation." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Bastogne ceremonies paled in comparison to the global media 
spectacle that accompanied the D-day celebrations in Normandy last June, it was 
an important event for Belgians and those Americans who fought here.  
</P>
<P>
 In its way, it was also far more typical of the string of World War II 
commemorations that have unfolded across Europe since 1989: It was a chance for 
local people to remember the heroes, the victims and the suffering connected to 
battles that determined the fate of their region. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Continent braces for the culmination of these events next year with the 
50th anniversaries of both Nazi Germany's unconditional surrender in early May 
and the end of the war against Japan in August, the emotional swath left by 
commemorations over the last five years has raised questions about whether such 
intensely emotional reminders do more harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
 Many, for example, argued that June's Normandy celebrations, which excluded 
Germany, achieved little more than to remind Germans that 45 years of 
successful democracy isn't enough for redemption, that they still remain apart, 
uninvited outsiders in Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to bring the Germans in," warned Michael Stuermer, director of a 
government-backed think tank near Munich called the Ebenhausen Institute. 
"There can be no more D-days."  
</P>
<P>
 French President Francois Mitterrand's attempt to compensate for the D-day 
anniversary snub by allowing German armored vehicles to roll down the 
Champs-Elysees as part of the French National Day military parade merely 
triggered an embarrassing debate in France about where Germans should or should 
not go half a century after the Nazi collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans got a similar taste of such sensitivity earlier this month when a 
U.S. Postal Service decision to issue a commemorative stamp depicting the 
atomic mushroom clouds over Hiroshima and Nagasaki created outrage in Japan. 
Following a formal diplomatic protest, the Postal Service shelved the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, claim that remembering is too important to be derailed by the 
pain of reviving old memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to celebrate the past, because it's the only way we can learn 
from it," said Dominique Moisi, deputy director of the French Institute of 
International Relations in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bastogne, there was evidence for both arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, as at the D-day beaches, half a century was too soon to include German 
officials in a way that might have made the commemoration also an act of 
reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two generations have passed, but if you say you are German, people still step 
back," said Catherine Orban, a local schoolteacher. "Fifty years is too soon 
(to include the Germans)." 
</P>
<P>
 Guy Arend, the founder and director of the town's two museums that deal with 
the Battle of the Bulge, added: "I'm still afraid of the Germans." 
</P>
<P>
 But Robert Marbehant, a retired teacher and civil servant who lives in the 
Ardennes, said that commemorative ceremonies become more important with the 
passage of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are an occasion for documents and memories to be written down and 
published," he said. "The people who lived through the events are getting so 
old now that we need to do this before it gets too late." 
</P>
<P>
 He also sees such commemorations as lessons in civil responsibility by 
underscoring the fact that people risked their lives for others. For a new 
generation of West Europeans born into an era of enormous affluence that 
encourages self-indulgence, it is an important message. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anniversaries are a time for remembering, they are also a time for 
reflection," Madeleine Albright, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, 
told a group of dignitaries gathered for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Albright represented the United States at the official ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 But another lesson for a new generation of Europeans is the role the United 
States played in helping the Continent win back its freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the Americans did here goes far beyond commercial interest," Marbehant 
said. "Those who have an exact memory of events, the memory of being freed, 
they will always see the Americans with different eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Here, in the rolling hills of the Ardennes, that message is being carefully 
passed on. 
</P>
<P>
 At St. Joseph's boys school, for example, veterans correspond with students, 
who then read their letters aloud in class. And although the GIs who fought in 
and around Bastogne as young men now walk slowly and some require canes, they 
are still seen here with a mixture of respect and awe.  
</P>
<P>
 "The children here see the Americans as godlike," Orban said. "They came and 
saved everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 While that is exactly what they did, the price was horrific. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 19,000 GIs died in the battle, which contained and then repulsed the 
Germans' final offensive of the war during the freezing weeks of late December, 
1944, and January, 1945. More than 57,000 other Americans were listed as 
missing or wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Nazi offensive was finally crushed in late January, an estimated 
120,000 Germans had also died -- twice the number who fell in northern France 
trying to repel the initial Allied invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 During the height of the battle, German forces encircled Bastogne for several 
days, hoping to take the important road and rail junction by strangling the 
U.S. 101st Airborne Division defending the town. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the shortest, most famous statements of the war, Gen. Anthony 
McAuliffe rejected a German offer to surrender with a single word: "Nuts." 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, Gen. George Patton led a U.S. assault from the south that 
broke through the German ring and ended the siege of Bastogne. But it was a 
month more before the last German resistance in the Ardennes was broken. 
</P>
<P>
 Bastogne Mayor Guy Lutgen told a group of U.S. veterans who had traveled to 
Belgium for the commemoration: "We will never forget what you did for us."

BROTHER STUNNED BY SLAYING OF MAN DATING OFFICER'S WIFE; INVESTIGATION: THOMAS 
A. MINN, DESCRIBED BY ANAHEIM POLICE CHIEF AS 'VERY PLEASANT,' WILL BE 
ARRAIGNED TODAY.

 Two days before Paul R. Hangen was shot to death, he was in good spirits and 
"didn't appear to have a worry in the world," the victim's brother said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw him last Wednesday night, and nothing seemed wrong," Tim Hangen said. 
"His only plans for the immediate future was to trade in his Chevy S-10 pickup 
for a full-sized pickup. He had asked my father if they could go look at some 
trucks." 
</P>
<P>
 Hangen said he knew his 28-year-old brother was romantically involved with 
Elian Schonberger, 36, the estranged wife of a good friend, Anaheim Police 
Officer Thomas A. Minn. So last Friday night, when he heard that his brother's 
body was discovered in his white pickup truck just over a mile from 
Schonberger's home, he alerted police to the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom and my brother were close friends and did a lot of things together," 
Hangen said. "Tom seemed like a perfectly normal person, but the first instinct 
that my parents and I had was that it was him." 
</P>
<P>
 Minn, 36, was arrested Saturday on suspicion of shooting Hangen with his 
.45-caliber service pistol. He will be arraigned today, said Riverside County 
Sheriff's investigator Mark Lohman. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14-year veteran of the Anaheim Police Department, who is being held at the 
Robert Pressley Detention Center in Riverside in lieu of $250,000 bail, has 
refused requests to be interviewed. He has been placed on administrative leave 
until the case is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very concerned about all the parties involved in this case," Anaheim 
Police Chief Randall Gaston said. "But at this point, we're not jumping to any 
conclusions until the case is resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston said Minn, a motorcycle officer assigned to the traffic division, is "a 
very competent officer with an exceptional work record." As far as he knows, 
Minn had never been suspended or reprimanded for acting inappropriately while 
on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very well thought of by other officers," Gaston said. "And he's very 
pleasant." 
</P>
<P>
 During an interview Sunday from her Corona home, Schonberger said she and Minn 
had been estranged for more than a year, and that her husband seemed to accept 
the fact that she was dating one of his friends. But Schonberger said that, 
when she started packing her things, Minn began talking of suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he finally realized I was going to be totally gone," she said. "I had 
told him that after the first of the year, he had to find himself another 
roommate." 
</P>
<P>
 Schonberger said she planned to file for divorce and hoped to build a future 
with Hangen. "Paul loved me, and he wanted things to work out between him and 
me," she said. "I was not the pursuer. We pursued each other." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tim Hangen, 34, said his brother told him earlier this month that he was 
somewhat uneasy about the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he didn't think he wanted the same things as she did," Hangen said. 
"He said she called him all the time and that he had been avoiding her. He said 
she was pushing him." 
</P>
<P>
 After learning of the relationship, Hangen said he warned his younger brother 
to be careful and to "watch his back." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was concerned that their relationship could pose problems, but he said it 
was no big thing and that he could handle it," Hangen said. "Never in my 
wildest dreams did I imagine something like this happening." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hangens moved to California from Colorado in 1979. Paul Hangen attended 
Norco High School and completed a two-year welders' program at Chaffey College 
in Alta Loma, in San Bernardino County. He lived with his parents in Corona and 
worked as a welder at Foothill Engineering in Corona. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a person who just liked to have fun," his brother said. "He played 
like he was a tough guy, but it was funny because he had such a soft heart. 
Some people thought he was arrogant, but he was very loyal to his friends and 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 Hangen said his brother collected knives and was passionate about riding 
horses and attending rodeos. 
</P>
<P>
 "He used to go to country nightclubs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had no intentions of being with anyone permanently," Hangen said of his 
brother. "He just wanted to have fun."

CITY REJECTS SUIT AGAINST BOLSA CHICA DEVELOPMENT; LAND USE: HUNTINGTON BEACH 
COUNCIL TURNS ASIDE CITIZEN DEMANDS, VOTES 5 TO 2 NOT TO FIGHT WETLANDS HOUSING 
PROJECT IN COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The City Council on Monday rejected a proposal that it file a lawsuit 
challenging the development of the Bolsa Chica wetlands, despite the angry 
pleas of a number of residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed," said Councilman Ralph Bauer, who had proposed the lawsuit 
during an executive session. "To think that it can be resolved by talking is 
utter nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Peter Green, who said he voted against Bauer's motion because of 
the cost of a lawsuit, said, "We had little chance of winning." The vote was 5 
to 2.  
</P>
<P>
 A large audience had gathered at the Huntington Beach City Council meeting to 
demand action following last week's Board of Supervisors' approval of a project 
calling for the construction of 3,300 homes in and around the Bolsa Chica 
wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like the city to do something," said Bruce Monroe, a spokesman for the 
Sierra Club. The county based its decision, he said, on information that was 
"incomplete, misleading, inaccurate and it caused the supervisors to pass 
something that will cause environmental damage to the ecosystem and financial 
loss to the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Vandersloot, a member of the Bolsa Chica Land Trust, which has led 
opposition to the project, said that "if the county bond fiasco is a nightmare, 
the Bolsa Chica plan is worse than a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for permission to complete the project, which still must be 
approved by the California Coastal Commission and the Army Corps of Engineers, 
the Koll Real Estate Group has agreed to spend about $48 million to restore 950 
acres of deteriorating wetlands on the 1,600-acre site by, among other things, 
constructing a full tidal inlet reconnecting the marshland to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Koll group, which is planning the project, and the county have said 
repeatedly that the proposed project is legal and that they are willing to 
negotiate with the city and other affected entities on how to reduce or 
eliminate costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials say that the project will cost local taxpayers tens of 
millions of dollars in added services, with no relief in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 An internal financial analysis developed by the city earlier this year 
estimated that the Koll project could cost the city as much as $60.8 million 
initially and $5 million a year thereafter. Because Bolsa Chica is not within 
city limits, Bauer said, the city will not receive any of the development fees 
associated with the project. But, because of its proximity to the city, the 
councilman said, Huntington Beach will undoubtedly be required to provide such 
services as fire and police protection, road improvement and water. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county is basically telling the people of Huntington Beach to go jump in 
the lake," Bauer said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, some responded with a similar message to the Koll group and the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sue the pants off them," said resident Jackie Geier-Lahti. Times 
correspondent Debra Cano contributed to this story.

SUPERVISORS TO DECIDE ROLE OF CITIES IN BASE PLAN; DEVELOPMENT: IRVINE, LAKE 
FOREST ARE EXPECTED TO OPPOSE MOVE TO RELEGATE THEM TO ADVISORY ROLE IN EL TORO 
REUSE PROCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Lake Forest and Irvine city officials are expected to oppose a proposal to 
drop them from the planning process for El Toro Marine Corps Air Station when 
the Orange County Board of Supervisors meets today. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors are supposed to debate a staff recommendation that the board 
assume sole responsibility for planning the reuse of the Marine base. Before 
Measure A was approved by voters last month, a nine-member board composed of 
the five supervisors, three representatives from Irvine and one from Lake 
Forest made up the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, which was the county 
planning agency for the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 After Measure A's passage, the board decided to abandon the reuse planning 
authority. It voted to withdraw from the planning authority by year's end, 
leaving Irvine and Lake Forest without any participation in the planning 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 At today's meeting, the supervisors are expected to approve the county's 
formal withdrawal from the planning agency, but delay its taking effect until 
Jan. 31.  
</P>
<P>
 Measure A requires the county to build a commercial airport at El Toro. While 
it does not require the dismantling of the planning authority, it calls for a 
new 13-member El Toro Airport Citizens Advisory Commission to plan for an 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The lame-duck planning agency was studying three development possibilities for 
the base. In addition to an airport, the agency was also considering a 
combination of residential, commercial and industrial development, and a theme 
park, university campus or research-and-development facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter Wednesday to County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider, Irvine 
City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. asked the board to postpone any action on the 
dismantling of the planning authority until next month. The supervisors are 
leaning in favor of a proposal that they take sole control of planning for the 
base and assign an advisory role to Irvine and Lake Forest officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady argued that Irvine officials have not had enough time to adequately 
study the county's proposal to put together a new planning agency without input 
from Irvine and Lake Forest, the two communities most affected by the closure 
of El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the complexity of issues related to this important item, my office will 
not have sufficient time to review and seek City Council action on a county 
proposal," Brady wrote in the letter. "In keeping with your commitment that we 
would be given sufficient time to review and comment, I would like to request a 
delay" of the board action scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine and Lake Forest officials are hoping that the supervisors' 
preoccupation with Orange County's financial crisis will make them amenable to 
a postponement. However, a staff report encouraged the supervisors to plow 
ahead with plans to dismantle the current planning agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the county's entrance into bankruptcy, (county planning) staff 
believes that it is important to continue with the (proposed) reuse planning 
process," the report said. The reorganization of the planning agency must 
continue in order to "streamline" it and pursue federal and state funding for 
the planning process, the report continued. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to qualify for continued federal funding, the new planning agency has 
to be approved by the Defense Department. The current planning authority has 
already received and spent $741,616 from the Pentagon, $403,335 from the 
Federal Aviation Administration and $200,000 from the county, Irvine and Lake 
Forest combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a taxpayers' group that opposed Measure A has asked the supervisors 
to call a special election next November to repeal the initiative. The 
Taxpayers for Responsible Planning cited the county's recent bankruptcy in 
asking the supervisors "to start showing fiscal leadership and begin a repeal 
of Measure A." 
</P>
<P>
 If the supervisors do not schedule a special election, the group threatened to 
gather enough petition signatures to put the measure on the ballot.

SANTA'S SOLDIERS; SALVATION ARMY, SPONSORS SPREAD CHRISTMAS CHEER 
</P>

 Modesta Martinez has a Christmas tree in her home, which brightens life a bit 
for the four grandchildren she is struggling to raise following their 
abandonment by their mother. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But with her husband's meager income, Martinez couldn't afford Christmas 
presents for the children, who are all under the age of 6, and the area under 
the tree remained bare. 
</P>
<P>
 All that changed Monday when the Salvation Army, operating from a temporary 
Christmas center at a city maintenance yard in Santa Ana, loaded Martinez's 
pickup truck with wrapped Christmas gifts donated through the organization's 
Adopt-a-Family program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a beautiful Christmas," said Anaheim resident Martinez as 
Salvation Army volunteers placed three shiny bicycles in the truck bed, along 
with several large boxes wrapped in bright Christmas paper. "The children will 
have happy faces, that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvation Army, which began charity operations in Orange County more than 
100 years ago, expects to give food baskets and gifts to 10,000 county families 
this Christmas, which is the most ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "The need goes up every year," said Dolores Barrett, who heads social services 
for the Salvation Army in the county. "And as we become better organized, more 
sponsors come forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day Monday, about 200 families trekked to the Salvation Army's 
headquarters here. Mostly single mothers with children, they received Christmas 
help ranging from cereal and canned goods to sweaters and Barney dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Each family was screened beforehand and asked to fill out a Christmas "wish 
list" of food and gifts family members needed. Then those lists were given to 
sponsoring companies, individuals and families who donated the needed items. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just me and my kids, and I'm out of work so it's hard for me to buy 
anything for them," said Anaheim resident Yolanda Raines, 22, as volunteers 
filled the back of a friend's car with toys and food for her and her three 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 The children, ranging in age from 3 years to 8 months, perked up when they saw 
the Play-Doh, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and Sesame Street characters they 
got to take home with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy that the Salvation Army could help us this year," Raines said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the week, needy families that are not part of the Adopt-a-Family 
program will also visit the Salvation Army Christmas center for holiday 
assistance. Each family will receive a ham or a turkey and trimmings for a 
complete Christmas meal. Any child 14 or under will also receive an unwrapped 
gift. 
</P>
<P>
 As with the Adopt-a-Family program, all recipients have already registered and 
will arrive at set times to pick up their holiday baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope they think someone thinks they're special," said Barrett, 
standing in front of a warehouse full of games, in-line skates, stuffed animals 
and dolls that will be handed out by the end of the week. "Someone out there 
cares."

FOG SOCKS IT TO JOHN WAYNE ONE MORE TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second straight day, flights at John Wayne Airport were delayed Monday 
by dense, patchy morning fog that forecasters say will linger and could cause 
problems for travelers again today. The fog will likely be driven out Wednesday 
by an incoming storm, but it too could cause travel delays. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday morning travelers were inconvenienced as about 20 flights were delayed 
by fog. The airport opened at 7 a.m., but none of the dozen arriving flights 
were allowed to land until shortly after 9 a.m. Many were diverted to other 
area airports, including Long Beach and Los Angeles, airport spokeswoman Pat 
Ware said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 departing flights also experienced delays. Only two airplanes had 
taken off by 9 a.m. and seven were on the runway awaiting clearance from the 
control tower, Ware said.  
</P>
<P>
 Wendell Cox, 46, a pricing manager for Union 76, left his Mission Viejo home 
early Monday for the airport, expecting delays when he awoke to fog. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox, who was going to Sacramento for a business meeting, fidgeted as he stood 
in line at 9:30 a.m. at the America West check-in counter, asking about his 
flight, which was to take off at 9:05. The Boeing 737 that was to take Cox and 
some 100 others to the state Capitol had yet to arrive at John Wayne; it had 
been delayed on the ground in Sacramento because of conditions in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a meeting set up at noon," Cox said. "They said a plane took off 
from Sacramento for here at 9:30 a.m. It takes about an hour and 15 minutes or 
so, so we should leave here about 10:45 a.m. I may be OK. I'm not too worried 
because my meeting is right at the airport." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox's plane finally took off at 11:22. 
</P>
<P>
 Also at the mercy of the weather was Mary Jane Gardner, 70, who read a 
newspaper to pass the time. She was going home to Lakeport in Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really anxious to get home because my first granddaughter was born two 
months ago and she's just adorable," said Gardner, a pianist who had lived in 
Laguna Beach for 30 years and was visiting Orange County to perform at a couple 
of parties. "My son will be expecting me three hours earlier than I'll actually 
get there." 
</P>
<P>
 With weather-related delays expected for the next two days, airport officials 
advised travelers or those meeting flights to call their airlines in the 
morning to check whether departure times have changed or arriving flights have 
been diverted. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you are "on a departing flight at 7 a.m., you really don't have any 
choice," but to show up, Ware said. "You have to be here early to check-in. 
You'll just have to wait to see what the weather is like." 
</P>
<P>
 Ware said holiday-related travel will pick up Thursday and reach its peak on 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 A 30% to 40% chance of showers is predicted Wednesday with skies clearing 
Thursday. Friday will be mostly sunny. 
</P>
<P>
 A slight chance of rain is predicted Christmas Eve with skies clearing 
Christmas Day, said Curtis Brack, a forecaster with WeatherData, which provides 
forecasts for the Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures through the week will be in the 60s and low 70s throughout Orange 
County. Thursday and Saturday will be cooler, especially in the inland valleys, 
where highs are expected to be in the upper 50s. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said the coastal fog is the product of a counterclockwise wind 
pattern currently centered near Santa Catalina Island. That pattern is making 
the typical patchy fog, which is common this time of the year, denser and more 
widespread in coastal areas, Brack said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the difficult visibility conditions, motorists seemed have to escaped 
major problems. Kari Keul, a spokeswoman for the Orange County Traffic 
Management Center in Santa Ana, said no weather-related accidents were reported 
Monday morning.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; OUTDOOR MARKET A HIT WITH SHOPPERS

<P>
 Looking like a miniature version of the mammoth swap meet long held at the 
Orange County Fairgrounds, the Saddleback Outdoor Market was praised by several 
people looking for Christmas gifts Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love swap meets and I didn't like having to drive 30 miles to the nearest 
ones," said Estelle Rogers of Laguna Niguel while holding a bag of onion bagels 
and several brightly illustrated Christmas T-shirts. "They've got some really 
nice things here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Saddleback Outdoor Market made its debut last month after Saddleback 
College officials and market organizers spent nearly a year trying to get city 
permits. It is the only swap meet in South County. 
</P>
<P>
 A previous attempt to open a swap meet failed in 1989. Everyone connected with 
the latest attempt is eager to avoid past mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've answered all of the questions about us," Saddleback Outdoor 
Market President Sam Marcus said. "We've drawn 20,000 shoppers the first four 
weekends, many from outside Mission Viejo. It's been able to work because it's 
unique -- there's nothing like this between Costa Mesa and San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
 The marketplace has averaged about 200 vendors each weekend. A small 
percentage are people trying to clean out their garages. The majority of stalls 
are run by small businesses and artisans. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus said an effort has been made to attract artisans who sell their wares 
at such well-known fairs as Laguna Beach's Sawdust Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our biggest challenge has been to break through and let people know we're 
open, because shopper habits are hard to break," Marcus said. "We're trying to 
be something between the Sawdust Festival and a swap meet by attracting high 
quality merchants who can sell at swap meet prices." 
</P>
<P>
 Located at the northwest corner of the campus, the swap meet has the benefits 
of plentiful parking spaces and no charge for admission. In addition to the 
merchandise booths, there is a row of food booths selling refreshments ranging 
from hot dogs to cappuccino. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus plans to provide regular entertainment, including performances by 
college bands and chorale groups. But the goal for most of those attending the 
swap meet was getting a good deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I made out pretty good," said Jeanette Stephens, proudly displaying a 
pair of new jeans and boots. "I got both of these for $40. Can't do that in a 
department store." FRANK MESSINA

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Fullerton Joint Union High School District administrator was hired 
Monday night to serve as Brea Olinda High School's interim principal until a 
permanent replacement is found. 
</P>
<P>
 John Seeland, who retired from the Fullerton district as assistant 
superintendent of business services in 1991, will begin his new job Jan. 3.He 
succeeds John Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson recently was transferred to the Brea Olinda Unified School District 
office following a grade-changing scandal that involved the tampering of 
hundreds of students' transcripts. Letter grades were changed to pass 
notations, course titles were switched and double credit was awarded for 
classes taken to improve grades on hundreds of student transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson failed to tell his superiors about the illegal and widespread grade 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 He will begin his new job as director of support services in the district 
office Jan. 3. His duties will include overseeing student expulsions and 
curriculum and instruction programs, Supt. Peggy Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's annual salary -- about $73,000 -- will remain the same, Lynch said. 
She said Seeland will serve as principal for about four months, making $302 per 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeland, 61, has experience serving as an interim principal, officials said. 
He was interim principal at Fullerton High School for about three months until 
the Fullerton district found a permanent principal in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeland, of Idaho, was hired as a counselor in a Fullerton district high 
school in 1963 and became principal of Sonora High in 1978. He served as Troy 
High School's principal from 1983 to 1988, when he became assistant 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch said she will be accepting applications for a permanent Brea Olinda High 
School principal for the next few months. MIMI KO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: PLACENTIA YORBA LINDA; SCHOOL BOARD CANCELS COUNTY CRISIS 
MEETING 
</P>

<P>
 The Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District Board of Trustees has 
canceled a special meeting that was to take place Wednesday to discuss how it 
will be affected by the county's financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was canceled because the district's lawyer was not able to attend 
and the board had nothing specific to discuss. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was called by the board at a special meeting on Friday. At that 
meeting, the board held a short public session, then met in closed session for 
two hours with Marc Winthrop, an attorney hired specifically to guide trustees 
through the bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 During the open portion of the meeting, trustee Cathy Ann Brooks suggested the 
board form a committee to advise members on the role of district administrators 
in the district's decision to invest $50 million in borrowed money in the 
county's investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would behoove us to think of getting a broad-based committee for an 
administrative review," she said. "Specifically, we've had one (resident) 
asking for (administrators') resignations. Should we not position ourselves to 
deal with that scenario?" 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Craig Olson cut off Brooks' comments and said she was 
discussing personnel issues, which can only be discussed in closed sessions. 
The board decided to consider forming a committee of experts to offer advice on 
financial matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to remember whose bankruptcy this is," said board member Karin M. 
Freeman. "We need to focus on where to go from here." DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; MOVING LIQUOR STORE ACROSS STREET ISN'T EASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 15 years in the same location, liquor store owner John Baker is trying 
to persuade city officials to let him move his business across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 To Baker, it seems like a simple request. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city has balked, citing concerns about the potential proliferation of 
liquor stores on Main Street. Planning commissioners delayed a decision on 
Baker's request at a previous meeting and will reconsider his move Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should have been a piece of cake," said Baker, owner of Nip 'N Stuff 
liquor at 322 Main St. "It's not like I've committed a major crime." 
</P>
<P>
 But some Planning Commission members say once Baker moves, a new liquor store 
could open at the old site under the old conditional use permit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seal Beach is already an over-served area as defined by the ABC," state 
Alcoholic Beverage Control, Planning Commissioner Dr. Brian Brown said. 
"Somebody else could come in and open up a liquor store there. We wouldn't want 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker's landlord, who evicted him to open a business at the location, has 
pledged not to sell alcohol at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the issue is the longstanding battle in the city by some to 
limit alcohol sales and operating hours of beach area businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it has anything to do with liquor, (planning commissioners) get real 
nit-picky," said commission member Jim Sharp. "The new landlord said he will 
sign a pledge to have no liquor -- there shouldn't be any real problems with 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 1, Baker must begin paying rent on his new location, and he fears that 
further delays will prove hazardous to his business. "If I can't move, then I 
have no choice," Baker said, "I'm going to go out of business." RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: DANA POINT; GIVING KIDS A WAY TO CELEBRATE NEW YEAR'S

<P>
 Working on the principle that kids also deserve to have fun on New Year's Eve 
and that parents deserve a night off, the city will sponsor its annual 
sleep-over for children Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 City recreation leaders will watch 24 children from ages 6 to 12, who will 
enjoy pizza, movies, gymnasium games like indoor hockey, and crafts. 
</P>
<P>
 After an evening of activities, the children will toast the New Year with 
sparkling cider. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives the children an exciting and fun way to celebrate," said Community 
Services Manager Bonnie Nicholl. "And it gives parents a night to themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost for the sleep-over is $19, including pizza. The overnight event will 
be held at the Community Center, 34052 Del Obispo St., from 6 p.m. to 8:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants should bring sleeping bags and a toothbrush. Children will be 
sleeping on thick mats in the community center, Nicholl said. Space is limited 
to 24 children signed up at the community center, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Point also offers a similar service throughout the year called Flicks for 
Kids on the first and third Saturdays of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 For $5 per child, recreation workers will watch youths from 6 to 9 p.m. 
Children are given dinner, play indoor sports and watch a video movie. 
</P>

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; COUNCIL ADOPTS ETHICS CODE, 'WHISTLE-BLOWER' 
PROTECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has adopted its first formal code of ethics and "whistle-blower" 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members said that Orange County's troubled economic times 
underscore their belief that the time is right to institutionalize ethical 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 The new code, which governs everything from the private use of telephones by 
city employees to acceptance of gifts from members of the public, is based on a 
1990 memorandum on ethics created by City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Brady already had guidelines for his staff people, which were very good," 
said Lowell Johnson, an aerospace worker on the five-member citizens' committee 
that helped shape the new ethics code. "We had some good debates on what ethics 
really is. It was tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Greg Smith was first to suggest that the city create a formal code 
of ethics, citing concerns raised by members of the city's Safe Community Task 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the points that came out of that task force was that there is a real 
crisis in ethics," Smith said. "Not only in the community, but throughout the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 The new ethics code tells employees that "high ethical standards" are more 
important than loyalty to co-workers or department heads. 
</P>
<P>
 The code was accompanied by a resolution affirming state law that protects 
employees from retaliation for reporting wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The whistle-blower resolution was prompted by Mark Petracca, a UC Irvine 
social science professor who says it did not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good, but it's not good enough," Petracca said. "What I was looking for 
was a proactive apparatus that would actively encourage people as a matter of 
course to be whistle-blowers." 
</P>
<P>
 With such a policy in place, Petracca said, some city employees might have 
been encouraged to question the city's decision to borrow additional money to 
invest in the county portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 "What incentive would anybody in the city have had to raise a question about 
whether or not that was proper?" Petracca said. "No one would have had that 
incentive." 
</P>
<P>
 But Petracca applauds the city's new ethics code, which addresses what he 
believes is a national concern about the behavior of officials at all levels in 
government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Bedley, an Irvine elementary school principal and member of the citizens' 
committee that formed the new code of ethics, said people are struggling to 
create a standard for ethical behavior at all levels of society. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people don't really understand what the word ethics means," said 
Bedley, author of several books on "values-based" education. "What we tried to 
do is to say that the city must go beyond its laws to form a code of ethics."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; POLICE ARREST 16 IN LIQUOR SALES STINGS 
</P>

<P>
 Police officers arrested 16 people on suspicion of selling alcoholic beverages 
to minors in a decoy program that sent police cadets into local businesses to 
try to buy alcoholic beverages, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to curb drinking and driving among youths, police said, they sent 
three 19-year-old cadets into 70 Garden Grove establishments that included 
liquor stores, mini-marts and bars to purchase liquor last Thursday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, 16 people who allegedly sold liquor to the decoys were cited and 
released on the misdemeanor charge, according to Police Officer John Enriquez. 
</P>
<P>
 Each cadet attempted to buy liquor with marked $5 and $10 bills, Enriquez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the minors were successful in making the purchase, usually without the 
seller asking for identification, officers would come in to make the arrests, 
Enriquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least once a year, normally around the holiday season, we would do some 
type of program to make people more aware of the dangers of alcohol," Enriquez 
said. THAO HUA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; NURSES PLAN CLASSES IN CARE FOR DIABETICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Free classes in diabetes management will be offered early  
</P>
<P>
 next year by registered nurses Sunnie Bell and Sue Eisen of Project Health. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Orange County there are about 215,000 people with diabetes," Bell said, 
"but half of those are not aware they have it." 
</P>
<P>
 Complications from untreated diabetes include heart attacks, strokes, kidney 
disease and blindness. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell said the four-week classes will emphasize a "shared management" approach 
to diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
 That means patients -- working with physicians -- assume responsibility for a 
large portion of their health care, including blood testing at home to 
determine insulin doses. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes will be from 6:30 to 9 p.m. at: 
</P>
<P>
 * Saddleback Memorial Medical Center, 24451 Health Center Drive, in Mission 
Viejo, on Tuesdays, starting Jan. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 * Western Medical Center's Bash Auditorium, 1001 Tustin Ave., in Santa Ana, on 
Wednesdays, starting Jan. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 * Family Fitness Center, Warner Avenue and Springdale Street, in Huntington 
Beach, on Tuesdays starting Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 To register, call Bell or Eisen at (714) 229-4850. ALAN EYERLY

 Huntington Beach officials are taking a serious look at the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department has 230 sworn officers. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past decade, Huntington Beach's population has increased from 
180,000 to about 190,000.During that same period, the city's ratio of police 
officers per 1,000 residents increased from 1.1 to 1.2, but it is still below 
the national average of 2.2. 
</P>
<P>
 Also during this 10-year period, calls for service increased 54%, from 75,898 
to 116,727 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hoped to hire six new officers and a sergeant soon. But the 
bond crisis might put those plans on hold. Today 
</P>
<P>
 Put on your dancing shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a chance to learn some dancing moves and meet new people at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Singles Swing and Ballroom Dance Club meet at 7:30 p.m. at 3100 E. Coast 
Highway in Corona del Mar. 
</P>

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; BETTING AGAINST TIME, POSTAL USERS FIND WAITS 
SHORTER THAN EXPECTED

 The crowds were out in force at Costa Mesa post offices on Monday, heavily 
laden with packages and greetings cards on which the ink was still drying, 
ready to pay the price of postponement: a seemingly endless wait in line. 
</P>
<P>
 But depending on what time they arrived, they didn't have it too bad, even if 
it was the busiest mailing day of the year. U.S. Postal Service officials at 
branches on Sunflower and Adams avenues said they didn't get everyone through 
within the ideal five minutes, but they managed to keep the traffic flowing 
even at peak times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been wall-to-wall people," said Joseph Zapata, supervisor of customer 
service at the Adams branch. "We've been moving 'em as quick as we can move 
'em. . . . You listen to people walking out and they're saying 'It wasn't as 
painful as I thought.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur O. Martinez, district manager for the Santa Ana postal district, said 
the crowds were expected and staff members were added to keep the waiting time 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 The day was so busy because most people figured there was still an outside 
chance of getting their gifts to loved ones by Christmas, without paying for 
rushed delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just that over the weekend, people realized, 'It's getting late,' " 
Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowds came prepared for delays, with thick books or stacks of Christmas 
cards that had yet to be addressed and stamped. 
</P>
<P>
 Teri Lacher, 45, of Santa Ana was surprised that she only got through a few 
pages of John Grisham's lengthy tome "The Firm" before her number was called at 
the post office on Sunflower. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's moving pretty well," she marveled. 
</P>
<P>
 Karre Cloutier, 21, of San Clemente, who was waiting at the Sunflower branch 
to mail a gift to friends in Georgia, viewed the slight delay as a chance for a 
breather. 
</P>
<P>
 Cloutier, rattled by a day of crammed parking structures, "angry-looking" 
shoppers and rude drivers, said: "The post office is relaxing compared to the 
mall."JULIE MARQUIS

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; CRISIS TEAM WORKS TO MAKE COLLEGE SAFER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Since an Orange Coast College student was abducted and raped in the spring of 
1991, the college's Crisis Alert Team has been trying to make the campus a 
safer place for the 23,000 students who walk its halls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that crime is going up in the community, and we are an open campus 
and would be foolish not to be prepared," Sharon Donoff, the team's chairwoman, 
told the Coast Community College District board recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight members make up the team, which tries to respond to all reports as 
quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-year-old team also offered this advice to students: 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't be embarrassed to call campus security and ask for an escort service. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you don't want an escort, try to walk in groups through the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 * Never carry a lot of money with you. 
</P>
<P>
 * And, above all, report any suspicious incident. An emergency phone line goes 
directly to security. If you're on campus, head for the nearest red telephone 
and dial 5555. TOM RAGAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; DEMOLITION BEGINS ON OLD MARTIN TERMINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sparks flew in the early Monday morning fog when a demolition crew started to 
tear down the Eddie Martin Terminal at John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Dedicated by then-Gov.Ronald Reagan in May, 1967, the Edward J. (Eddie) Martin 
Terminal was named after the die-hard pilot who established an airfield in the 
area in the early 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, Martin was conducting business on a dirt runway. 
</P>
<P>
 That rudimentary airfield eventually paved the way to building the John Wayne 
Airport, although it wasn't until 1979 that the airport was named after the 
movie star who lived in Newport Beach, said Pat Ware, a spokeswoman for the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months after the Eddie Martin Terminal was built, it had to be expanded 
and modified to accommodate an increasing number of air travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 As the popularity of air travel increased, the terminal was given face lifts 
to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
 But the terminal has problems with asbestos and the pillars were built too 
close for modern jets, Ware said. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, airport use outgrew the two-story edifice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty old," said Ware. "The destruction is kind of the end of an era." 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, the demolition crew started destroying the northern portion of the 
terminal, including the baggage claim area. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Thursday, the walls are scheduled to be torn down once and for all. TOM

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; COUNCIL CONSIDERS ENDING SPLIT SESSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has taken the first step toward doing away with split-session 
meetings that some residents complained had cut them out of the local 
government process. 
</P>
<P>
 Since June, the council has met at 2 p.m. for study sessions, joint sessions 
with committees and to discuss and act on other matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the council would close the session to discuss legal issues and resume 
the open public meetings at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents complained that their day jobs prevented them from 
attending meetings or even watching them on public access television and, in 
effect, kept them from participating in local government. 
</P>
<P>
 The council decided Dec. 12 to try one-session meetings and is scheduled to 
take a final vote on the change Jan. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor John Hedges and other council members wanted to eliminate the 2 p.m. 
sessions but also wanted to leave the council the flexibility to restore them, 
if the volume of business increased enough to make the split sessions necessary 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 If the change gets final approval, the council indicated that it will 
eliminate the afternoon session, meet at 5 p.m. on the second and fourth Monday 
of each month for closed sessions and begin its open sessions at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The earliest the council will meet in one session will be in early February.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; STUART DRIVE PARKING BAN TO BE CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council today will consider a proposal to prohibit street parking on 
Stuart Drive in an effort to minimize auto thefts, discourage street vendors, 
and improve traffic safety in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say that as many as 180 vehicles are parked on both sides of the street 
on any given night, 35 more than the street can accommodate, according to a 
traffic study. The tight squeeze has caused a safety hazard for pedestrians, 
especially children, walking into traffic from between parked cars. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, drug dealers often use vehicles parked on the street to hide from 
police and sell drugs, police said. In a report to the council, Police Chief 
Stanley L. Knee said that unless the parking problem is solved, the 
neighborhood will deteriorate further, driving property values down. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,000 people live in 51 apartments along the 1,800-foot stretch of 
Stuart Drive. Last year, the Police Department converted one apartment to a 
police substation with two full-time police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the crime rate and number of requests for police assistance have 
declined, Knee said prohibiting on-street parking will help discourage gang 
activity, drug-dealing and drive-by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 It will also offer children in the neighborhood a place to play. The nearest 
park is about a mile away and there are no recreational facilities nearby, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the proposal is approved, residents, apartment owners and managers will be 
notified at least 30 days before the parking restrictions are implemented. 
Violators will be warned, instead of cited, during the first 30 days of the 
parking ban. 
</P>
<P>
 A "No Parking" sign will be placed on the north and south curbs of Stuart 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey in September indicated that sufficient off-street parking is 
available in the apartment complexes along Stuart Drive, Knee said. A total of 
575 spaces were counted, but many of the garages were being used for storage, 
or people were living in them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Knee said city code officials are working with the apartment owners and 
managers to make the garages available for parking.BERT ELJERA

MAN KILLED BY GUARD AT SANTA ANA TOWING YARD; SHOOTING: THE VICTIM APPARENTLY 
WAS REACHING FOR WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE A BB GUN WHEN HE WAS SHOT FOUR TIMES, 
POLICE SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A security guard at a towing company fatally shot a 24-year-old mechanic who 
reportedly appeared to be reaching for a gun, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Douglas Forsyth, of Norco, was shot at 5:45 p.m. Sunday in a storage 
garage adjoining the International City Towing Co. in the 1300 block of East 
Wilshire Avenue, according to Santa Ana police Lt. Dave Petko. 
</P>
<P>
 "A preliminary investigation reveals that the mechanic may have been reaching 
for a gun when he was shot," Petko said. Investigators later determined the 
weapon was a BB gun. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the California West Patrol security guard, 28-year-old Benjamin 
Echeverria, also of Norco, was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and was 
being held at the Santa Ana city detention facility on $25,000 bond, according 
to Lt. Robert Helton. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investigators are not in a position to say it was a self-defense 
situation," Helton said. "They are still looking at this issue. That's why they 
arrested him on manslaughter. There is nothing there that indicates willful 
homicide, but they did arrest him." 
</P>
<P>
 The towing company, which also operates as a private impound lot for cars, 
trucks and boats, was closed Sunday. Situated in an industrial park, it is 
fenced and has a security-controlled entrance, including a video camera. 
Company officials declined to comment on the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls to the Tustin-based security company were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Helton said that California West had an arrangement with the towing company 
that allowed the security firm to park one or two vehicles inside the gates of 
the facility. Guards then drove through the gates to pick up their patrol cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Echeverria told police he and Forsyth were alone in the business when the 
incident occurred, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Echeverria, Forsyth "was standing beside one of those large, 
roll-around tool boxes (and) reached up on top of the box, grabbed or started 
to grab what appeared to him to be a semi-automatic handgun," Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The security guard, in turn, drew his weapon, firing at least four rounds, 
all of which struck the mechanic," Helton said. "As it turned out, (Forsyth's) 
gun was a BB gun that, according to investigators, could easily have been 
mistaken for a .45-caliber handgun." 
</P>
<P>
 Helton said Echeverria was at the towing company when police arrived and may 
have called for them through the company's dispatcher. Forsyth was pronounced 
dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men knew each other from seeing each other at the premises but had no 
other relationship that police were aware of, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators will probably present their evidence to the district attorney's 
office today, Helton said. An autopsy was performed Monday.

WOMAN'S LIFE WAS ON UPWARD CURVE WHEN CRASH SUDDENLY ENDED IT 
</P>

<P>
 Donna Davis was remembered Monday as a well-liked school employee with a 
contagious laugh, whose life had taken a Cinderella turn and who was making 
plans for marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Rooney is a 29-year-old high school dropout and unemployed mechanic 
who had been sleeping at friends' homes or in his car, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday evening, Davis, 34, of Brea was killed instantly and her boyfriend 
was severely injured when Rooney's car, going about 70 m.p.h., rear-ended 
theirs, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were awaiting results of blood-alcohol tests before seeking criminal 
charges against Rooney. He was in stable condition with internal injuries 
Monday in a jail ward at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, being held on 
suspicion of vehicular manslaughter and felony driving under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of blood tests were expected as early as today, said Huntington Beach 
Officer Michael H. Corcoran. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' boyfriend, Mark McLaughlin, 41, of Garden Grove, was in critical 
condition at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, Corcoran said.  
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police Rooney had been speeding on Adams Avenue when he crashed 
into Davis and McLaughlin near Magnolia Street in Huntington Beach just before 
7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who is survived by children aged 7 and 9, was remembered Monday as a 
devoted mother and colleague whose ready laugh brightened the Fullerton School 
District business office where she had worked as a clerk for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a wonderful employee. It was one of the saddest scenes I've ever seen 
at work today," said district Supt. Duncan Johnson. "She brought real cheer 
into the workplace with her." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis had told friends of her hopes to marry in the next year or two, said her 
sister, Judy Fry. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were making a life together. She'd had a rough life up to this point and 
things were really looking up," Fry said. "It was one of those Cinderella 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 Rooney had been homeless and out of work for months, although he had a talent 
for fixing things, said his mother, Joy Rooney. She said Rooney stayed with his 
parents or friends or slept in the Chevrolet Blazer he was driving Saturday.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: RIGHT START LINKS LOSS TO PENDING SALE OF CATALOGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Right Start Inc., a Westlake Village retailer of products for infants and 
young children, reported a loss of $1.92 million for the second quarter that 
ended Nov. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-quarter loss was almost quadruple the $525,000 loss reported in the 
same quarter a year earlier.The latest loss, however, reflected a onetime 
charge of $1.55 million for the pending sale of the company's Children's Wear 
Digest Catalog. Second-quarter sales totaled $11.8 million, down 5% from a 
$12.4-million loss posted a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 For the six-month period, the company reported a loss of $1.86 million on 
sales of $26.3 million, compared to a year-earlier loss of $341,000 on sales of 
$26.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenny Targon, chief executive of The Right Start, said the sale of the 
catalogue "will generate sufficient cash to fund our continuing retail 
expansion, eliminating the need to seek outside financing in the short term." 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it is negotiating a definitive agreement for the sale of the 
catalogue. The agreement could be in place by Dec. 31, The Right Start said.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: SPECIAL DEVICES INC. SHOWS EARNINGS JUMP OF 63% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Special Devices Inc., a Newhall-based manufacturer of trigger devices for the 
automotive and aerospace industries, reported a 63% jump in earnings for the 
company's fiscal fourth quarter that ended Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Profits in the fourth quarter totaled $1.08 million, compared with $662,000 in 
the same quarter a year earlier.Fourth-quarter sales increased to $19.8 
million, up 53% from $12.9 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fiscal year, Special Devices reported net income of $3.17 million on 
sales of $64.5 million, compared with year-earlier profit of $1.33 million on 
sales of $37.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company attributed the improved results to surging sales in its automotive 
division, which makes pyrotechnic initiators used in air-bag inflation systems 
on automobiles. Sales in the automotive division totaled $49.5 million in 
fiscal 1994, up 72% from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The aerospace division benefited from the company's recent acquisition of Scot 
Inc., a Chicago-based company that manufactures aircraft crew escape 
components. Aerospace sales totaled $15 million in fiscal 1994, up $1.94 
million from a year earlier. Most of that gain came as a result of the 
acquisition of Scot.

HOG WILD; OLIVER SHOKOUH STARTED HIS HARLEY DEALERSHIP ON A SHOESTRING; TIMES 
HAVE CHANGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW HELLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty years ago when he gave up an engineering career in Detroit to open a 
Harley-Davidson motorcycle dealership 2,000 miles away, many of Oliver 
Shokouh's friends questioned his sanity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people thought I was crazy, especially because Harley-Davidson was 
considered a dinosaur," Shokouh said, recalling his move to Glendale long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Shokouh, who had never run a business, had little more going for him than a 
vague belief in the Harley brand's charisma. He'd become intrigued with 
motorcycles as a teen-ager and later "I became a hard-core Harley buff," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As he struggled initially to keep his small-business dream alive -- even 
dipping into his children's college fund and customer deposits to make the 
dealership's payroll -- the skeptics seemed to have a point. 
</P>
<P>
 Harley-Davidson Inc. itself once came close to bankruptcy, and about 
one-quarter of its dealer network went under during the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shokouh stuck out the dark days,and his stamina paid off as the Harley 
factory in Milwaukee, improving its products and recharging its mystique, 
staged a remarkable comeback. The company's sales rose from $295 million in 
1986 to an expected $1.5 billion this year, while Harley's profits have soared 
from $4.3 million to a likely $105 million in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Shokouh, 48, has experienced similar growth at his Harley-Davidson of Glendale 
dealership, where sales have nearly quadrupled since 1982. Last year, Harley 
recognized his marketing efforts by naming him its Promoter of the Year. Among 
other things, he organizes a charity motorcycle Love Ride every November from 
his dealership to Castaic, which attracted 21,000 riders this year. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Shokouh, a soft-spoken man who seems more like a laid-back 
motorcycle enthusiast than a hard-driving salesman, presides over a dealership 
that is not only a motorcycle showroom, but is also part Harley-Davidson 
boutique. 
</P>
<P>
 Purple neon signage looms over racks of Harley clothing and displays of Harley 
earrings, mugs and miniature bikes. The new bikes are already sold; the old are 
museum pieces, for display only. 
</P>
<P>
 Shokouh won't disclose his dealership's revenues. But he did say a large 
metropolitan dealership gets up to 350 bikes a year from Harley. Harley bikes 
cost from $5,200 to $18,000, with the most popular ones in the $14,000 range. 
Given that about 60% of his revenues comes from motorcycle sales, the rest from 
parts, services and accessories, his business might gross around $6 million a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a big change from 1975 when he took over a failed Harley dealership in 
Glendale with less than $10,000 in capital. He won't say what the dealership is 
worth now, but he concedes that other Harley dealerships a third of the size of 
his are now fetching over $1 million in California. 
</P>
<P>
 His main concerns these days are trying to expand the store and training his 
children to take over the dealership. Some motorcycle experts believe that 
Harley, with its production capacity stretched to the limit, and its market 
share again under attack from Japanese competitors, is due for a slump. But 
Shokouh still has his faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a phenomenon, not a flash in the pan," he insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1975, that faith seemed more like a delusion. Harley-Davidson was a 
shadow of its once-prosperous self, a division of a company whose main business 
was bowling pins and pool tables. Meanwhile, Harley's production was dogged by 
quality problems, and the market was flooded with low-priced Japanese imports. 
</P>
<P>
 Shokouh was then a research engineer for White Motor, a Detroit diesel-truck 
manufacturer. On a visit to a local Harley dealership run by a former 
colleague, he saw an opportunity to go into business for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made business sense even though I didn't really know what I was going 
into," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Harley had franchises in Michigan available, he was more interested in 
California, where motorcycle sales are less seasonal and where he had gone to 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
 In Glendale, the previous Harley dealer had gone bankrupt. But he left a 
building that was available for lease at $1,300 a month and could be reopened 
at low cost. 
</P>
<P>
 So Shokouh moved from Michigan with his wife and four children, giving up his 
$20,000-a-year engineering job. Unable to raise money from banks because of his 
lack of business experience, he was totally dependent on cash flow to stay in 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes things got desperate. Once, a customer, tired of waiting for 
delivery of his bike, called to say he was coming by to retrieve his deposit. 
Trouble was, Shokouh had used the deposit to help make payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately, on the way down, he changed his mind and decided to give it 
another week," Shokouh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, he exported bikes to Japan to generate sales -- at one time, exports 
accounted for half his volume -- and also came up with offbeat promotions such 
as a special service club, which offered round-the-clock emergency roadside 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 When Harley introduced its new, big touring motorcycle model, with a rubber 
cushion between motor and chassis to soften the ride, many aficionados were 
offended by this soft styling. But Shokouh took the new bike out on weekends 
with his service club and had members test-ride it during pit stops, which led 
to a lot of sales. 
</P>
<P>
 After a management group bought out Harley in 1981, the company, saddled by 
debt and swamped by Japanese competition, barely avoided bankruptcy as many 
dealerships folded. "Nearly every dealer had to scrape through, and many, many 
of our dealers did not make it," recalled Jerry Wilke, Harley's vice president 
of marketing in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Wilke, the survivors were dealers like Shokouh who hung on to 
their faith in the Harley mystique. "He has a passion for the product, he has a 
passion for the company, and . . . it's that type of passion the customer can 
feel." 
</P>
<P>
 "I believed in the product," Shokouh said. "Somebody had to keep it going." 
</P>
<P>
 Harley roared back with new models and updated engines, and a marketing 
strategy that expanded its appeal beyond its traditional blue-collar niche to a 
more upscale clientele revived the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Shokouh was well-placed to take advantage of the "rich urban biker," or 
"rubbie," phenomenon. "There are so many entertainment people out here and 
they're the ones that really glommed on to the Harley," said Bob Jackson, 
senior editor of Motorcycle Product News, a Westlake Village publication. 
Indeed, Shokouh's customers include Jay Leno and rocker Eddie Van Halen. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Shokouh admits he isn't selling as many motorcycles as he'd like to. 
Harley, leery about compromising quality for quantity, has not matched supply 
with demand and exports some 30% of its bikes. As a result, U.S. dealers have 
long waiting lists and impatient customers end up asking for their deposits 
back. "It's really hard not to do a sale when the customer's willing," Shokouh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to analysts, capacity constraints were the main reason Harley's 
share of the domestic motorcycle market has slipped slightly in the past year, 
and some believe the "rubbie" phenomenon has peaked. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shokouh isn't losing any faith. He is negotiating to double the size of 
his store, mainly to provide more space for merchandising, and he is hoping to 
pass on the business to his children. His daughter is in the accounting 
department and his 19-year-old son is also helping out while pursuing a 
business degree. 
</P>
<P>
 There's an irony in making it a family business. During the bad days, he would 
drop his son off at school on his Harley. "It embarrassed the hell out of him," 
Shokouh recalled. "The attitude has changed. Now the kids are really into it."

MALLS TIGHTEN SECURITY FOR HAPPIER HOLIDAYS; CRIME: SOME HAVE BEGUN BIKE 
PATROLS OR ARE STATIONING LOOKOUTS ON ROOFS. POLICE ON HORSEBACK ARE ALSO 
KEEPING WATCH OVER PARKING LOTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 With five shopping days left until Christmas, malls and department stores 
across the San Fernando Valley have beefed up their security operations to 
prevent encounters with those all too familiar holiday visitors: shoplifters 
and robbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with local police patrols, security teams at shopping centers have 
instituted their own bike patrols, hired extra personnel and posted private 
security officers on mall roofs to scan parking lots and create more of a 
security presence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put more people out on the floor and in the parking lot (now) than any 
other time of year. . . . We also have a large pool of off-duty LAPD officers," 
said Brian Pearson, general manager at the Antelope Valley Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidents of shoplifting, car break-ins and robbery increase by about 50% 
during the hectic shopping season, police say. Not surprisingly, some shoppers 
have received rude introductions to holiday robbery, and some individual chain 
stores that lack the benefit of elaborate security systems have suffered a 
cruel initiation into holiday crime. 
</P>
<P>
 One morning last week, just after a Radio Shack store in Sherman Oaks opened, 
a man, who posed as a customer looking for audio cables, walked in and 
allegedly held the manager of the store at gunpoint, said Humberto Correa, a 
store employee. After ordering the manager to wait in the bathroom, the gunman 
then allegedly stole thousands of dollars worth of merchandise, Correa said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days before that, two men also ran off with stereo speakers, Correa 
said. The 3-month-old Radio Shack store has video cameras, but no security 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 This time of the year, police reports at the West Valley Division are rife 
with tales of credit card fraud, shoplifting and car burglary. In some cases, 
thieves break car windows looking for cellular phones, presents and other 
merchandise, said Steve Kegley, a senior officer with the division. 
</P>
<P>
 For this reason, Panorama Mall has bike patrols in its parking lots and 
security guards as lookouts on the mall's roofs. Periodically, guards ride 
bikes through the parking lot, stopping to help shoppers when they have 
questions and scanning the grounds for troublemakers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Mary Callahan, the mall's manager, customers can be picked up or 
delivered to their cars via a mall van, to forestall being attacked as they 
struggle to their vehicles with heavy packages. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have closed-circuit televisions that monitor the parking lots, and they 
are monitored on a 24-hour basis," said Mary Lankester of the Topanga Plaza 
mall in Canoga Park. The security team there, like many others in the area, is 
working with LAPD officers from a nearby police substation. 
</P>
<P>
 One night last week, the LAPD had police on horseback riding through the 
Topanga Plaza parking lot to make a noticeable security presence. But a woman 
shopping at the mall recently had her purse snatched with $3,265 worth of 
jewelry inside, police reports said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most police stations have increased uniformed police foot patrols in malls and 
shopping strips throughout the Valley, police say. Plainclothes officers 
monitor mall grounds, sometimes placing decoys to attract criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put out cars and camp out and wait there until someone tries something," 
said Eric Knudson, general manager for the Fallbrook Mall, which has tripled 
patrols for this holiday season. "Last year, they did this and caught a number 
of individuals." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD also trains 100 law enforcement Explorer Scouts, who help patrol area 
malls. The Scouts, who range in age from 14 to 20, undergo 136 hours of 
training at the Police Academy. They often escort shoppers who can't find their 
cars, but the Scouts have also helped in the arrest of shoplifters and purse 
snatchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many shopping centers also hired temporary personnel after Thanksgiving to 
boost their regular security teams until the New Year. "Our break-ins are way 
down," said Richard Deanda, security director for the Media City Center mall in 
Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Sherman Oaks Fashion Square, security director Seamus Keenan hired 10 
temporary security guards to bolster his staff of more than 30 officers. The 
mall has also increased the hours of its permanent staffers and extended their 
workweek to six days. 
</P>
<P>
 Mall officials also brief store managers within the mall about safety and 
credit card fraud, which also increases during the holidays. "We prepare the 
merchants by giving them seminars in advance," Keenan said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Northridge Fashion Center there was no need to hire more security 
officers. But the mall is increasing the hours of its regular security staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge mall is not fully open because of earthquake repairs, but Sears 
and the Broadway did reopen there last month. And Ed Tiritilli, Sears' general 
manager, said he is using more plainclothes security throughout the store.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: DATAMETRICS REPORTS PROFIT IN 4TH QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Datametrics Corp., a Woodland Hills maker of computer printers and plotters 
for military and commercial markets, reported a $217,000 profit for its fiscal 
fourth quarter that ended Oct. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 A year earlier, Datametrics earned $44,000. The profit in the latest quarter 
gain came on a 10% decline in sales, to $6.97 million from $7.78 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Datametrics' fiscal 1994 profit, however, plunged to $31,000 from $1.48 
million in the prior year. Its annual sales rose 5%, to $25.2 million from $24 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company attributed the profit decline for the year to its investments in 
developing color printers for commercial markets.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW / JACK SEARLES: STATE EMPLOYMENT OFFICE IN VENTURA TO 
CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Employment Development Department's Ventura office, opened just four 
years ago as a convenience to residents of western Ventura County, will be 
closed to the public next week. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the office on Market Street will continue to function as a call-in 
center, manager Annette Havens says.She said the closure, slated Dec. 30, was 
ordered by the department's Sacramento office as an efficiency measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "With our computerized systems, there's no reason for people to have to come 
in to" check on "their unemployment claims or ask about job openings," she 
said. "Except for the first visit, that can all be done by phone." 
</P>
<P>
 To initially file for unemployment insurance and job-seeking services, 
residents of the west county will have to travel to offices in Oxnard, Simi 
Valley or Santa Barbara, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Business people wanting to list job openings won't be affected by the closure 
because they normally do so by phone anyway, Havens added. 
</P>
<P>
 Does the improving economy have anything to do with the closure? Not at all, 
Havens said. Her office handled almost 2,000 jobless claims last month.

 The parent company of Saticoy-based Petoseed Co., a world leader in developing 
and marketing hybrid vegetable seeds, has signed an agreement to merge Petoseed 
into a new international agribusiness and biotechnology giant to be controlled 
by a Mexican conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
 Petoseed's owner, privately held Geo. J. Ball Inc. of West Chicago, Ill., has 
signed a letter of intent to merge the Saticoy firm into an as-yet unnamed 
entity with production and research facilities in 35 countries and annual 
revenues of about $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The other investor is Empresas La Moderna, a Mexican company involved in 
agriculture, packaging and cigarette manufacturing and distribution. It claims 
to be Mexico's largest cigarette company. 
</P>
<P>
 Empresas is controlled by Pulsar Internacional, a privately held group with 
23,000 employees and wide interests in consumer products and financial 
services. Both companies are based in Monterrey. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the deal were not disclosed. But Empresas will hold a majority 
interest in the new partnership, with Ball having "a strong minority ownership 
position," including seats on the entity's board, said Barrie Ricketts, Ball's 
senior vice president and chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 None of Petoseed's employees are expected to lose their jobs in the merger, 
officials of the firms said. Petoseed has 1,300 employees worldwide, about 200 
of them in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're confident the new company will do extremely well," Ricketts said. 
"Since we'll have a major interest in it, we'll benefit from its progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides serving as Petoseed's administrative headquarters, the Saticoy 
facility east of Ventura includes a large warehouse and distribution center. 
Both operations are expected to continue at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Empresas' stock is traded on Mexico's Bolsa. Its American depository shares 
have been trading since February on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 If completed, the merger would culminate a series of deals that will bring 
several of the world's leading seed producers under the Empresas umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Petoseed acquired a Dutch seed company, Royal Sluis. Also 
this year, Empresas signed an agreement to purchase Asgrow Seed Co., a 
130-year-old concern in Kalamazoo, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfonso Romo Garza, Empresas' chairman and chief executive, said Petoseed and 
Asgrow will probably operate independently. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the merger is expected "to develop a tremendous connection 
between seed producers, farmers and consumers." Hybrid vegetable seeds, long a 
Petoseed specialty, are designed to increase yields and develop crops that are 
resistant to disease and drought. The new company will have about 440 
professionals working on seed research and development worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The family-owned Ball concern will retain a number of other seed companies, 
including Burpee, a leader in sales to home gardeners. 
</P>
<P>
 Petoseed began as a tomato seed producer in Ventura in 1950, later developing 
hybrid cantaloupes, cucumbers, watermelons and a variety of other crops. The 
company moved to Saticoy in 1958. It was acquired by Ball in 1967.

 Biopool International, a Ventura company that produces kits for diagnosing 
blood, vascular system and other disorders, has been sued by a rival firm in 
Camarillo for allegedly stealing trade secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiff, Medical Analysis Systems Inc., charges that Biopool and its 
subsidiary, Medical Diagnostic Technologies Inc., misappropriated Medical 
Analysis' "secret processes and formulas" for producing liquid controls and 
reagents, said Karen A. Breslow, a Los Angeles attorney representing Medical 
Analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael D. Bick, Biopool's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement 
that the charges "are totally without merit, and we will vigorously defend our 
position." He added, "Biopool has always run its business in accordance with 
the highest ethical standards." 
</P>
<P>
 The products in question are used by hospitals, laboratories and doctors to 
measure chemicals in body fluids. Medical Analysis claims that its products are 
easier to use and more accurate than others in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Breslow said her client believes that its secrets were obtained from former 
Medical Analysis employees who went to work for Biopool and its subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed Nov. 30 in Ventura County Superior Court, seeks to enjoin 
Biopool and its Medical Diagnostic subsidiary from marketing products using 
Medical Analysis' technology. The suit also seeks unspecified punitive damages.

CONCRETE SOLUTIONS OR LOTS OF CONTROVERSY?; QUAKE-DAMAGED PARKING GARAGES 
REBUILD WITH EMPHASIS ON STRENGTH. BUT SOME CUSTOMERS STILL LACK CONFIDENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After the Northridge earthquake, images of crumpled parking garages generated 
horrified speculation about how many lives would have been lost had the shaking 
happened during a busy workday. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven months later, as large garages are being rebuilt, debate continues over 
how best to build a quake-resistant parking garage. There is also plenty of 
finger-pointing over why various garages failed and criticism of certain 
designs and construction methods. 
</P>
<P>
 Those involved in building parking garages damaged by the Northridge quake 
argue that the building code simply didn't anticipate how much the ground shook 
in the 6.7-magnitude temblor. Others blame the construction process itself, 
saying it encourages economy over safety. And structural engineers say that 
fear of crime has led to the design of large, open garages, without enough 
concrete shear walls to absorb shocks from a big quake. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Sherman Oaks Fashion Square shopping mall, the decision was quickly 
made by the Australian owner, City Freeholds Inc., to raze its 18-year-old, 
three-level, partially damaged parking garage. The company spent $6.5 million 
to build an all-steel, three-story garage, a type rarely found in California, 
where most garages are a mix of concrete and steel. 
</P>
<P>
 City Freeholds believes its new garage would do well in another earthquake 
because steel can create a very strong structure, despite a city survey that 
found about 100 steel-frame office buildings with severe quake damage. City 
Freeholds Vice President Brian Pickering noted that the Sherman Oaks mall is an 
all-steel construction that held up well in the quake, whereas the Bullock's 
and Broadway department stores there are made primarily of concrete and 
suffered significant quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Another advantage of using steel is that damage is more visible and therefore 
can be quickly repaired, while in concrete the cracks and weak spots are harder 
to see, Pickering said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall's new garage was open in November, in time for the holiday shopping 
season and three months sooner than a concrete structure could have been 
finished. "We had to have the structure up for Christmas," Pickering said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite assurances that rebuilt parking garages will be far stronger, an 
informal survey of shoppers last week at the new Sherman Oaks Fashion Center 
garage revealed that some customers are still skittish about parking there. 
Nancy Leonell of Encino said she doesn't feel safer. "If it starts shaking, 
I'll just run," she said. "I hate my car, so if it gets smashed, I can collect 
insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Bertinelli of Studio City said she parked near the exit in case of 
shaking. And a mall employee who didn't want her name used said, "I don't think 
(the garage) is structurally sound." 
</P>
<P>
 Mall owners admit that winning public confidence for their new garages might 
not be easy. When the Sherman Oaks garage opened on the day after Thanksgiving 
-- the busiest shopping day of the year -- the outside parking lot was full, 
but the new garage remained partially empty, Pickering said. Since then, more 
customers have begun parking in the garage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at the Northridge Fashion Center, the most severely damaged mall in 
the city, all four of the parking garages were battered. One two-story garage 
completely caved in, another partially collapsed, and two others were badly 
damaged. Today, three new parking garages are going up, and the major change is 
that concrete will be poured in at the site, rather than having precast 
concrete slabs made at a factory and hauled in. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge mall's owner, MEPC American Properties Inc. of Dallas, thinks 
freshly poured concrete will be sturdier. The two garages that had the worst 
quake damage were built in 1989 and made of precast concrete. Precast buildings 
can be built faster and for less, but they've been criticized since the quake 
because steel and concrete used to connect the precast segments were not strong 
enough in many cases and caused some garages to crumple. 
</P>
<P>
 In its new garages, the Northridge mall is also adding more walls to absorb 
earthquake shocks, as well as posts with steel cables wrapped around them to 
hold the concrete tightly in place. The three new garages are covered by 
insurance and are expected to cost about $20 million. The first garage will be 
finished in January, another in March and the third in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly may have the newest and maybe the safest decks in all of Los 
Angeles," said MEPC President David Gruber. He said the new Northridge mall 
garages would suffer "minimal damage, if any, with the same force that hit 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 Gruber also said his company isn't going to sue the original contractors or 
structural engineers because the old Northridge parking structures were built 
according to the building code. 
</P>
<P>
 His company has organized focus group studies of local residents to find out, 
among other things, how they'll feel about parking in the new Northridge 
Fashion Center garages. The response has been "mixed," Gruber said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 At Cal State Northridge, a two-story parking garage on Zelzah Avenue that 
caved in on one side remains a fenced-off, tangled mass of fallen concrete, 
perhaps the largest untouched evidence of the Northridge quake. That's because 
university officials are still haggling with each other and the federal 
government -- who will pick up most of the bill -- over whether to demolish and 
build a new garage for about $18 million or try to repair the 3-year-old 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Thiel, chairman of the Cal State University Seismic Review Board, said 
the CSUN decision might not be made for several months and it won't be based 
solely on economic and technical grounds. If the people won't park in the 
existing garage after repairs, he said, "I expect the university would make a 
decision acknowledging that" and build a new one from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 Public concern might be fueled by continuing discussions over why some garages 
were so badly damaged in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Architect Nelson Behrend designed the third floor of the Glendale Civic Center 
parking garage, where some beams broke and fell through the floor during the 
quake. That garage has since been repaired, but Behrend said there were many 
results of this earthquake that "we've never seen before. Some of this has to 
do with the providence of God." 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Curd, president of A.T. Curd Builders in Glendale, which built the CSUN 
garage that collapsed, said the structure failed because severe ground motion 
during the quake caused the building to bend like a tree in the wind. The 
motion was much greater than anticipated by the 1991 building code, he said, so 
columns snapped, dragging down the concrete slab, which in turn brought down 
part of the garage's exterior. 
</P>
<P>
 Curd is now building a parking garage at County-USC Medical Center that he 
said would take this kind of movement into account. The biggest design change 
is that internal columns are being reinforced to withstand similar bending 
motion. The Northridge quake "is definitely changing the way things are being 
designed and built," Curd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some engineers say that parking garages have inherent weaknesses because ramps 
interrupt the interior layout and complicate the way quake forces are 
transferred. Robert Englekirk, the structural engineer who designed the two 
Northridge mall garages that suffered the most damage, noted that garages also 
lack ceilings, partitions and other energy-absorbing features found in houses 
and office buildings. "A lot of times we don't recognize how much more movement 
there is in parking structures than in buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 While Englekirk defended the soundness of the precast concrete method, he 
acknowledged that it's been popular in part because it's quicker to build. And 
even now, after the Northridge earthquake has raised concerns about parking 
garages, developers "want to know, is it less expensive?" 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics are impatient with what they see as defensiveness in the 
construction industry. Peter Yanev, chairman of EQE International in San 
Francisco, a leading earthquake engineering firm, brands as "baloney" the 
argument that no one anticipated the severe motion of the Northridge 
earthquake. His said that after the big Armenian temblor in 1988, his firm 
warned that precast garages should be limited or banned in seismic areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts also say it's not the design itself that counts so much as how the 
design is implemented, and note that some poured-in-place concrete facilities 
also collapsed. One weak link in any structure could potentially cause a 
cave-in. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Northridge mall garage, for instance, the concrete shear walls that 
were supposed to absorb the force of the quake were the only things left 
standing. Instead, the force was taken by parts of the structure that weren't 
meant to withstand the shaking. That means the connections between the various 
pieces somehow failed, said Helmut Krawinkler, director of the John A. Blume 
Earthquake Engineering Center at Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that collapsed, it was almost always in the details," Krawinkler 
said. Problems have surfaced with parking garages, he said, in part because 
they haven't been considered as important as other buildings and are often put 
up as quickly and cheaply as possible. "The whole design/construction process 
needs better supervision." 
</P>
<P>
 One result of the Northridge earthquake is that changes are expected in Los 
Angeles building code requirements for parking structures. Richard J. Phillips, 
a structural engineer who headed a city task force to study parking structures 
after the quake, said his group recommended five basic code changes. They 
include requiring more reinforcing ties to hold concrete together and other 
strengthening features.  
</P>
<P>
 The task force also advised independent reviews of engineering and 
construction work. Many garages are built in a process in which a general 
contractor is hired to oversee the entire building process. "That puts 
engineers in a position of a conflict of interest," Phillips said. "There 
should be independent reviews to make sure the engineer is not unduly 
influenced by the guy who's picking up the tab." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many warn that any building code only establishes minimum standards. 
Engineer Krawinkler contends that abiding by the code "is a poor defense" for 
anyone who designed a parking structure that collapsed in the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The code is "just another silly book," he said. "Every engineer should know 
that just providing the code does not make a good structure."

 How do I stop renting and start owning? 
</P>
<P>
 Many readers ask me that question. Here are a few alternatives worth 
exploring. 
</P>
<P>
 State of California programs: 
</P>
<P>
 * The California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA) in Sacramento uses mortgage 
revenue bonds to buy loans from lenders statewide and to provide a variety of 
options for home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 * The California Housing Loan Insurance Fund offers 97% of purchase price 
loans to low- and moderate-income buyers, originated by certain approved 
private lenders. The maximum loan amount is $203,150. CHFA has both fixed- and 
adjustable-rate loans. For a list of CHFA-approved lenders and information, 
call (800) 789-CHFA. 
</P>
<P>
 * CHFA's Generation Link program allows parents to help their kids buy a home. 
Parents or other blood relatives can pledge 10% of the purchase price of the 
child's home as a second trust deed on their home. The parents are only 
responsible for the amount of the pledge and only in case of default by the 
borrower. Within seven years, the loan amortizes to a 95% loan and the pledge 
is removed. More information is available by calling North American Mortgage 
Co. in Woodland Hills at (800) 700-6262. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders who are approved by CHFA are also able to offer 30-year loans with a 
fixed rate of 5.95% to buyers who have suffered earthquake damage, who are of 
moderate income or who are buying in a so-called "target area" that has been 
identified by the federal government as needing assistance. "First-time" home 
buyers who were renters during the January Northridge earthquake may qualify 
for a CHFA loan if they can document serious damage to their rented premises. 
</P>
<P>
 There are income limits to keep in mind. A family in Los Angeles County of one 
or two people can't earn more than $55,700 and qualify for a CHFA loan; 
families of three or more can make up to $64,500 and still qualify. The income 
limits in Ventura County are higher. Certain income and purchase price 
limitations apply, based on the number of family members and location of the 
residence being purchased. To get a list of CHFA-approved lenders, call (800) 
789-CHFA. 
</P>
<P>
 City of Los Angeles programs: 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Housing Department administers several home ownership programs 
for first-time home buyers who purchase detached homes, condos or townhomes 
within the city limits. A first-time buyer is someone who has not had an 
interest in a home in three years. This requirement does not apply, however, to 
people buying homes within a target area. 
</P>
<P>
 * Silent seconds -- also known as secondary finance assistance mortgages -- 
are offered through the Los Angeles Housing Department to qualified borrowers. 
These second mortgages can be used in lieu of a down payment. The silent 
seconds carry a low interest rate with payments of interest and principal 
generally deferred until the residence is resold. The city forgives the second 
mortgage over time, but the borrower must pay a portion of any profit earned on 
the sale of the home to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain low-income borrowers may qualify for a silent second mortgage of up to 
$50,000. The income limits per household are $27,950 for one person, $31,900 
for two, $35,900 for three and $39,900 for four. Information is available by 
calling (800) 994-4444. 
</P>
<P>
 * Home Mortgage Revenue Bond Program. Los Angeles is offering 7.82% interest, 
30-year fixed-rate mortgages with about 3% to 5% down payments. These loans 
will be available starting in January through three different lenders for 
certain buyers. Buyers of a new home can earn up to $58,920 per household; 
buyers of a resale home can earn up to $49,100 per household. The loans are 
available to first-time buyers or any buyer who buy in a target area. For 
information, leave a detailed message with your name and address at (213) 
847-7631. 
</P>
<P>
 * HomeWorks! provides assistance for a first-time home purchase or a 
first-time purchase with home fix-up. There are actually two programs -- one 
with low down, easy qualifier loans and another with city grant money 
available. The loans are available for buyers in certain target areas who are 
low and moderate income. A family of four, for example, can earn up to $54,240. 
Low-income borrowers -- a family of four with an annual income of up to $39,900 
-- may also qualify for grants of up to 2% of the purchase price of the 
residence. For details, call (213) 847-7408. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the North Hollywood Redevelopment Project area, administered by Los 
Angeles' Community Redevelopment Agency, grants of up to $7,500 are available 
to some first-time home buyers. The money is available to certain low-income 
people and can be used for a variety of exterior home improvements. 
Low-interest loans for residential rehabs within the project area are also 
available for low- and moderate-income households with interest rates ranging 
from 3% to 10%. For information, call (818) 753-1918. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage Credit Certificates: 
</P>
<P>
 * These certificates are offered through different cities and counties and 
help buyers qualify for a larger loan by allowing them to take 20% of their 
mortgage interest as a federal income tax credit as opposed to merely an income 
tax deduction. For example, if you pay $10,000 a year in mortgage interest, 
$2,000 of that would be subtracted from your federal income tax liability. This 
means more disposable income and the ability to qualify for a bigger home loan. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, of course, a lot of wrinkles to the MCC program. Buyers must get a 
loan from lenders approved by their city or county for the MCC program. Buyers 
in Los Angeles city, for example, qualify for MCCs only if they meet certain 
income requirements. A household with one or two people can't earn more than 
$59,128 a year. The program is also generally limited to first-time buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But in a target area -- including parts of Pacoima, Panorama City, North 
Hollywood and North Hills -- MCCs are somewhat easier to get. In these cases, 
MCC applicants don't have to be first-time buyers and a household of three or 
more people can earn up to $70,560 and still qualify, said Sally Richman, 
housing, planning and economic analyst with the Los Angeles Housing Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beauty of this is that it gets into the moderate-income range; you don't 
need to be low income," Richman said. "The MCCs give the family more disposable 
income and they can more easily qualify for a loan." Information about the 
city's MCCs is available by calling (213) 847-7690. Buyers in other 
jurisdictions must contact their local county or city to see if the program is 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapping into your pension fund: 
</P>
<P>
 Borrowing against certain retirement or pension accounts is a way that some 
buyers can get a 100% mortgage without touching their accounts, said John 
Lucas, vice president and branch manager at ARCS Mortgage Inc. in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Public Employees Retirement Fund (CALPERS), for example, allows 
would-be home buyers to borrow against their retirement savings in lieu of 
coming up with a down payment. "Tapping into a pension account is a great way 
for some buyers to go," Lucas said. "The realtors are not always as aware of 
these programs as they need to be or as they could be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's one caveat about borrowing against a pension fund, warns Ben 
Hunnicutt, a realtor and CPA in Woodland Hills. If you borrow money from a 
pension fund that is a tax-deferred investment, you no longer get to deduct 
that interest from your taxes; indeed, the past interest you have earned is now 
taxable. 
</P>
<P>
 So be forewarned. In many of these loan programs, the application process 
isn't easy. So be prepared to deal with bureaucracy and get your credit reports 
in order.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: BIOSOURCE INTERNATIONAL TO RELEASE ESCROW SHARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 BioSource International Inc., a Camarillo supplier of medical test kits, plans 
to release about 1.1 million shares of common stock that it has held in escrow 
since June, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The shares are expected to be released by Dec. 31, upon completion of the 
company's 1994 financial audit.Release of the shares will result in a onetime 
charge against BioSource's 1994 earnings. The charge was required by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission because 504,000 of the shares now in escrow 
are being given to two officers of the company and one former officer as 
compensation. The company said it had yet to learn the size of the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The escrow agreement was required by the British Columbia Securities 
Commission when BioSource's predecessor company became publicly traded in 
Canada. The company said it has now fulfilled all the performance goals of the 
agreement.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: 20TH CENTURY FINANCING OKD BY SHAREHOLDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Earthquake-battered 20th Century Industries said it completed its 
capitalization deal with American International Group Inc. after shareholders 
"overwhelmingly" approved the transaction in a special vote Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century, a Woodland Hills insurer, suffered an estimated $900 million in 
earthquake losses, plunging the formerly profitable company to the brink of 
insolvency.Under the capitalization plan, New York-based AIG, the nation's 
largest commercial property and casualty insurer, is investing $216 million of 
equity capital in 20th Century in return for convertible preferred stock and 
warrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal could eventually result in AIG's investing up to $432 million in 20th 
Century and leaving AIG with more than 40% of the beleaguered company. The two 
companies also plan a joint venture to expand 20th Century's lucrative auto 
insurance business outside of California.

MYSTERY CLOAKS THE RAMS; FOOTBALL: QUESTIONS SURROUND THE QUARTERBACK SITUATION 
AND THE FUTURE OF THE FRANCHISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams are a mess, but as quarterback Chris Miller suggested Monday, there's 
no sense dwelling on it because the team doesn't know if it's coming or going. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk of the move, the latest excuse being offered by players to explain away a 
4-11 season, has increased, but Ram woes go far beyond a potential change in 
zip codes. 
</P>
<P>
 They begin with Miller, who regularly ends his press briefings by saying, 
"Good enough?" and yet, he has been anything but this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Hired for $9 million to save the day, Miller arrived in training camp and 
flashed leadership skills and incredible accuracy. Miller's early showing 
heightened Coach Chuck Knox's expectations, just as his regular-season collapse 
flattened the team's chances for success. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of things have happened this season," Knox said. "I don't think you can 
dump it all on Miller. That would be my answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's future with the team, however, might be short-lived, depending on who 
is coaching this team next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still think Chris Miller can play," Knox said Monday, but based on present 
circumstances, he will only play for Knox if Chris Chandler is too hurt to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler left Sunday's game with the Bears limping, complaining of a sore back 
and later learning he had suffered a bruised kidney. If the Rams had opted to 
practice Monday, Knox said, Chandler would have been unable to go, but Knox 
will wait until Wednesday before deciding who will start against the Redskins, 
and that tells you all you need to know about what he thinks of Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's supposition," Knox said. "I don't think we've leaned heavily toward 
Chandler." 
</P>
<P>
 So why isn't the $9-million man the team's starting quarterback? 
</P>
<P>
 "No. 1, he has been banged up," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Miller's healthy now, Chandler is not, and so why isn't the $9-million man 
the team's starting quarterback? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of all the circumstances and factors and because of the presence of 
Chris Chandler," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so Knox leans heavily toward Chandler, but where does that leave the Rams? 
Chandler is 2-4 as a starter with the Rams, and has been knocked out of more 
games (four) than the injury-prone Miller (three). Knox won't play Tommy Maddox 
at quarterback because it wouldn't be fair to him, but that didn't stop the 
team from inserting rookie Toby Wright into the starting lineup a week ago in 
place of veteran Anthony Newman. 
</P>
<P>
 "He deserved the opportunity," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 So why not give Maddox such an opportunity? 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had a chance to see Maddox," Knox said, and it's all quite 
confusing. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't look for any answers from Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I need to do is prepare myself for this last week. We're playing the 
'Skins and that's all I'm concerning myself with now," said Miller, who has 
completed only 52.7% of his passes this season. "There's going to be a lot 
shaking down after this year's over. There's going to be a lot transpiring 
during the off-season as far as coaches, players, team movement and all that." 
</P>
<P>
 But why has Miller's performance been so shaky this season? 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of reasons for it," Miller said. "I would like to have played 
better, put up better numbers and help this team win more football games. But 
it didn't work out that way and there are a lot of reasons, but I'll just leave 
it at that." 
</P>
<P>
 Blame it on wide receiver Todd Kinchen, who has given away four punts in the 
past four games, and who continues to be employed as the team's punt returner. 
Blame it on an offensive line that has rendered running back Jerome Bettis 
useless. Blame it on a defensive line, that has been anything but fearsome or 
on special teams that have not been so special. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are a mess. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get into semantics; what is ugly?" Knox said. "We haven't had the type of 
year that we would have liked to have had . . . We've lost six in a row, and 
that's a fact, but what can I tell people? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to call it a mess. I'll just say it's very, very disappointing 
. . . But I still think we have the nucleus of a good football team. We've got 
some good young players and I think it bodes well for the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The future, however, has never looked so cloudy for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got one game left so there's no reason to comment on what's going to 
happen next year because, hell, we don't know if we're going to be here or in 
St. Louis," Miller said. "Good enough? Been a pleasure."

 Cal State Fullerton senior guard Danny Robinson, who missed the Titans' first 
five games of the season when he was academically ineligible, will rejoin the 
team for tonight's basketball game in Titan Gym against San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans also will add David Harrison of Mt.Hood (Ore.) College to the 
roster. He also completed academic work to become eligible for the second 
semester. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any idea about how much either one of them will be playing right 
away because they haven't practiced with us yet, but they'll be available and 
they'll certainly give us more numbers in practice and help us from a depth 
standpoint," Titan Coach Bob Hawking said. 
</P>

 Robinson played in all 27 games last season, primarily as a reserve guard. LON

JOHN R. WOODEN CLASSIC TO RETAIN NAME FOR 1995 EVENT AT THE POND 
</P>

<P>
 The second John R. Wooden Classic will be at The Pond of Anaheim in 1995 with 
the former UCLA basketball coach's name continuing as part of the event, a 
tournament organizer said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Dec. 3 event was a success with a crowd of 18,307, there have been 
reports that Wooden was uncomfortable with the halftime tribute and how 
proceeds from the event were disbursed -- he reportedly wanted more given to 
charities. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two sides apparently ironed out their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Though there were some minor misunderstandings recently, they're going to 
move ahead with the coach's name attached to the event," said Todd Lieman, 
spokesman for Irvine-based Hill and Knowlton, which managed the event. MIKE

ANGELOS-BUCCANEERS TALKS HEAT UP; BUSINESS: A TAMPA BAY OFFICIAL SAYS ORIOLE 
OWNER IS THE APPARENT FRONT-RUNNER TO TAKE OVER THE TEAM SOON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MORGAN, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter Angelos' negotiations to buy and move the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to 
Baltimore have shifted into high gear, with the Oriole owner now among the 
front-runners to strike a deal -- and to do it soon -- according to a top 
Buccaneer official. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would definitely classify our meetings . . . as going beyond the 
preliminaries. We are going to move forward with some more in-depth discussions 
to see if we can consummate a deal," Steve Story, one of three trustees 
operating the team since the death of owner Hugh Culverhouse, said yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos, who met with Story for three hours Saturday night, concurred. "We're 
into the nuts-and-bolts negotiations. We're close to making the deal." 
</P>
<P>
 A contract to buy the team, subject to NFL review, could be signed within the 
next few weeks, Angelos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Story, in the area for the Buccaneer-Redskin game Sunday, met with Angelos and 
his attorney, George Stamas. They covered specific aspects of a deal and left 
Story encouraged that an agreement can be completed soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're interested in consummating a deal with someone quickly," Story said. He 
said he expects intensive discussions this week with Stamas, beginning with a 
conference call Monday, to hammer out the fine points, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Discussions will deal with several issues, including potentially up to $50 
million in team liabilities, from deferred player compensation to the Tampa 
Stadium lease, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Story described the meeting Saturday as the "most aggressive" yet. Angelos has 
met several times with Story, in Florida and New York.  
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly he's up there in the front -- there are several front-runners," 
said Story, who has expressed a preference for a buyer who will keep the team 
in Tampa, which has been home to the expansion franchise established in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees also will talk this week with other interested bidders -- 
primarily those who want to keep the team in Tampa, including New York Yankee 
owner George Steinbrenner, Story said. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos, the controlling partner of the Orioles, is seeking to buy the 
Buccaneers and move them to Baltimore to play in a publicly funded, 
$165-million stadium to be constructed adjacent to Oriole Park at Camden Yards. 
Stadium funding has been approved and the election of stadium supporter Parris 
N. Glendening as Maryland governor has eased some concern that opponents would 
try to rescind the bonding authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Story, who earlier had decried a lack of specific offers to accompany the 
interest shown by bidders, said he and Angelos have discussed the "parameters" 
of a bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos has said he is willing to offer $200 million for the team. He said he 
believes the Buccaneers, who play in an outdated stadium in front of some of 
the smallest crowds in the NFL, meet the league's guidelines for relocation, 
which require a team to be unsupported or unprofitable at home. He also 
predicts the trustees will be compelled by their fiduciary responsibility to 
the trust to accept the highest offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Story declined to comment on that, but has said price would be one of several 
factors the trustees will consider. The trustees have said that "all things 
being equal," they would like the team to stay in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
 Even competing bidders acknowledge they can't match Angelos' $200-million 
offer, made possible by the lucrative economics of the proposed stadium. They 
hope the uncertainty of league approval will enhance the value of their bids in 
the eyes of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's something the trustees will have to weigh," Story said. He said Sunday 
the trustees are not interested in an arrangement whereby the sale is 
contingent on the team being moved. Under Angelos' offer before Culverhouse's 
death in August, the team would still get a fair price even if the franchise 
was forced to remain in Tampa. "I think the league has made it particularly 
clear: They would like the franchise to stay where it is," Story said. 
</P>
<P>
 The legality of the league's current rules on moves -- untested in court -- 
are an object of debate among legal scholars. Trying to block such a move, 
especially if it is done to protect the Redskins' territory, could leave the 
NFL vulnerable to charges that it has violated federal antitrust laws designed 
to encourage competition in business. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the groups seeking to buy the Buccaneers and keep them in Tampa is 
prepared to "write the check," said Bruce Frey, a Chicago developer and member 
of the group headed by Palm Beach businessman George Lindemann. 
</P>
<P>
 But it won't be for $200 million, he said. "If Angelos is going to buy it for 
$200 million, he's got a team," Frey said Sunday. But, he added, "Why doesn't 
he just do it? With all deference to Mr. Angelos, stop talking about it and do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the competing bidders the trustees have heard from is a second Baltimore 
group, represented by local attorney Robert Schulman. Story described those 
talks as preliminary. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Kroenke, the prospective investor seeking a team for St. Louis, also 
has contacted the trustees, but seems focused on his talks with the Rams, Story 
said.

 NEXT MILLION: The Food Distribution Center in Orange is a mere few thousand 
pounds shy of handing out its 80th million pound of food since it started in 
1983. The nonprofit group, which distributes about 30,000 pounds a day through 
278 local agencies, expects to hit soon, with more than a little 
hoopla.Spokeswoman Margaret O'Malley says a computer on its dock is set to make 
all kinds of noises when the moment comes, and a party will follow. Says 
O'Malley: "The agencies all know that it's coming. It could be any day." 
</P>
<P>
 WHO'S THERE? The holidays bring an onslaught of people selling at your 
doorstep. In Cypress, Mayor Cecilia Age warns that unless you know it's for a 
bona fide nonprofit group -- such as the Girl Scouts -- "ask to see their 
permits." Permits are required for profit groups in most cities -- even if the 
sellers are children. . . . Cypress recently turned down a permit request to a 
group which was using children to sell candy door to door. It turned out to be 
a for-profit group. . . . The mayor says most don't even bother to seek a 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
 WHO NEEDS IT? You don't need a great football team to have a decent athletic 
program. At least not at Katella High School, where the smallest among Orange 
County's big high schools (enrollment 1,200 or more) is in third place after 
the fall portion of The Times all-sports competition (V1). . . . The Knights 
(115.2 points) trail only football powers Edison (137.8) and Mater Dei (123.1) 
despite a 1-9 football season. . . . The all-sports competition weights all 
sports equally, and Katella fared especially well in boys and girls 
cross-country and girls' volleyball.

 INJURED: Two CSUN softball players are recovering from a Friday night 
collision that left an apparently drunk driver dead. Traci Gallian, 19, and 
Shelby Wilcox, 20, were in Morro Bay, en route to a teammate's wedding, when 
their car was hit. Wilcox should fully recover, but not in time to play ball 
this season. She suffered a fractured skull, broken thigh bone and broken hand 
but may be released from the hospital this week. "I feel I've been gypped of 
the next six months," Wilcox says. Gallian was released earlier. She broke her 
collarbone.

 HOOPS: Cal State Northridge's two-game winning streak was broken when the 
Matadors lost, 116-54, against No. 17 Cincinnati. (C2) . . . It was the most 
lopsided defeat this year for the Matadors, who started the season with a 
23-point loss to No. 2 UCLA.

 BORN TO BE RICH: Oliver Shokouh, above, left the Motor City in the '70s to 
make it in motorcycles. He bought a Harley-Davidson dealership in Glendale. His 
friends told him it didn't make any sense, and they seemed right. But it sure 
has made a lot of dollars. . . . His sales have nearly quadrupled since 1982. 
"I believed in the product," he says. "Somebody had to keep it going." See 
Valley Business, Page 3. 
</P>
<P>
 RECORD: Valley foreclosures went through the roof this year, though they 
should slow down in 1995. . . . But what's been bad for property values has 
been good for Woodland Hills realtor Stephen Kaseno. Since he began selling 
just foreclosures -- or real estate-owned properties -- his income has gone up 
300%. In this market, he says, "the three letters REO make all the difference." 
See Valley Business, Page 8.

<P>
 SENIOR SPIRIT: This is not a very jolly season for many seniors. Spouses and 
friends have passed away; children have moved away. Fortunately, Valley 
agencies have come up with activities during the holidays (B1). . . . "Seniors 
still want to be as active and as giving as when they were young," says Dr. 
Maria Jimakas, a clinical psychologist.

MAN GUILTY IN SEX SLAYING OF GIRL, 8 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury Monday found Hooman Ashkan Panah guilty of first-degree murder in the 
sex slaying of a second-grade San Fernando Valley girl. 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Nuys Superior Court jury found Panah guilty of first-degree murder 
with special circumstances that make him subject to the death penalty pending a 
sanity hearing. The jury found that Panah, 23, killed 8-year-old Nicole Parker 
while sodomizing her and performing lewd acts with the child, whose body was 
found in his bedroom closet in Woodland Hills on Nov. 21, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah clutched prayer beads, shook his head and kissed a copy of the Koran as 
the seven-man, five-woman jury delivered its verdict. Then, in a strong, clear 
voice, he told jurors: "There goes another innocent man down." 
</P>
<P>
 Tears rolled down the cheeks of Nicole's mother, Lori Parker, who later told 
reporters how much she despised Panah. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate him. He took the life of the most precious little girl anybody could 
have," she said. "How dare he? She couldn't fight back. I hate him." 
</P>
<P>
 After the verdicts were announced, Panah's mother, Mehri Monfared, collapsed 
in front of an elevator, shrieking that her son was innocent and had been 
framed by a justice system prejudiced against Iranian Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Even seasoned prosecutors and police detectives were left teary-eyed by the 
verdict in a child murder case that has tapped deep emotions in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I don't understand is why anybody would do anything like this," said 
Joel Price, the lead detective in the case, as he wiped tears from his eyes. 
"It's not human." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole was found dead in Panah's apartment after vanishing from outside her 
father's apartment in the same complex. In addition to murder, Panah was 
convicted of sodomy, lewd acts with a child, oral copulation and penetration 
with a foreign object. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity and did not testify 
during the trial. The next phase of the case will focus on his psychiatric 
background and family history. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Robert Sheahen contends that Panah was sexually abused as a 
child in Iran, has been hospitalized for a mental disorder at least once before 
and has tried suicide at least twice. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury will hear testimony from mental health experts for the prosecution 
and defense and decide whether Panah knew right from wrong and understood what 
he was doing when he killed the child. If it finds that Panah was sane at the 
time he killed Nicole, a third hearing will follow to determine whether he 
should be executed or spend the rest of his life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Sandy R. Kriegler scheduled the sanity phase to begin 
Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the trial, Nicole's parents sat stoically in the front row of the 
courtroom. Lori Parker, the mother of three older sons, averted her eyes during 
particularly gruesome testimony and sobbed in a courthouse corridor during a 
detailed account of how her daughter died. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been hell," she said. "My life will never, ever be the same again. I 
lost my youngest child to a violent, violent death, and it's just not fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Panah's mother also attended the trial daily, at times appearing red-eyed and 
upset. On Monday, she distributed copies of petitions signed by about 500 
members of the Iranian American community protesting what they view as "biased 
and prejudiced" court proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah is believed to be the first Iranian American to face the death penalty 
in California. Lori Parker, a paralegal from Tarzana, is engaged to marry a 
criminal defense attorney, a point noted by Panah's attorney in pretrial 
motions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no good justice in this building," Monfared said. "I believe in 
American justice, but not in this building."

COUNTY WEIGHS HIV TESTS OF PREGNANT WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors today will weigh in on the 
emotional issue of HIV testing of pregnant women, considering a proposal that 
would require doctors at county clinics to discuss the availability of such 
tests with their patients and, even more controversial, probing the legality of 
forcing all pregnant patients at county facilities to undergo the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 29,961 AIDS cases reported in Los Angeles County at the end of 
September, 174 have occurred among children. In 106 of the pediatric AIDS 
cases, the virus was transmitted by the mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting the steep rise of such cases in recent years, county health officials 
had already initiated a program, scheduled to begin Jan. 1, that would offer 
HIV testing at 40 clinics that provide prenatal services. 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who is pushing the testing plan, feels that 
the program should be expanded to require that discussion of AIDS testing 
becomes a vital component of the doctor-patient dialogue, even with women who 
are not at high risk of contracting the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great the test is going to be available, but if women don't know if they 
are at risk for HIV, they won't know whether they need a test or not," said 
Antonovich deputy Kathryn Barger. "We think a discussion of HIV testing should 
become a part of the routine treatment of pregnant women at county facilities; 
it's in their best interest." 
</P>
<P>
 County health officials offered guarded support for the proposal but said it 
could raise problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was our intent all along that women be offered the test and be advised of 
the pluses and minuses," said John F. Schunhoff, director of the AIDS program 
in the Department of Health Services. "But whether we can mandate that all 
doctors bring up HIV testing is something we'll have to discuss with county 
counsel. There might be instances where a physician for one reason or another 
might not think it's appropriate. It's something we'll need to talk to the 
medical staff about." 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich's proposal comes at a time of growing debate over how far 
authorities should go to check the spread of AIDS. Because of its rising 
incidence, the disease is expected to become one of the leading causes of death 
among women of reproductive age if current trends continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County is home to one-third of all HIV-positive babies born in the 
state, according to county health officials. Health officials have concluded 
that more widespread HIV testing of pregnant women can be an important health 
care tool. 
</P>
<P>
 Those conclusions have been supported by recent studies that found that giving 
the drug AZT to HIV-infected pregnant women can dramatically reduce the 
transmission of the virus to the fetus. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on these studies, Antonovich wants a legal opinion from counsel as to 
whether county health facilities can force women at high risk for AIDS to be 
tested, an idea that has generated heated opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you consider the costs of providing AZT to the mother versus the costs of 
treating babies with full-blown AIDS and you can prevent these babies from 
being born HIV-positive, then it's well worth fighting to get that test," 
Barger said. 
</P>
<P>
 But mandatory testing of pregnant women has found little support in the AIDS 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't support it," Schunhoff said. "There is still a stigma attached to 
AIDS and you run the risk of driving people away." 
</P>
<P>
 Others point out that California law already prohibits mandatory AIDS testing, 
unless ordered by a court. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't need to seek an opinion from county counsel; they can't do it," 
said Phill Wilson, director of public policy for AIDS Project Los Angeles, a 
nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson argued that the recent AZT studies should not be used as an instrument 
to force testing on pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we are pleased with the possibilities that the outcome of the studies 
offer to populations that could be impacted, the studies are limited to a 
narrowly defined group of people and cannot be used to make a broad-based 
argument for mandatory testing," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California 
called the Antonovich proposal a "political ploy." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's politics playing with public policy," said Jon Davidson. "What evidence 
is there that women who may be HIV-positive are rejecting the HIV testing that 
is being offered? It seems to me to be a typical Antonovich response."

PROBE FINDS IT LIKELY BRISENO LIED UNDER OATH; COURTS: VENTURA COUNTY 
PROSECUTORS SAY CHARGES WILL NOT BE FILED BECAUSE TESTIMONY DID NOT AFFECT 
TRIAL'S OUTCOME. EX-OFFICER'S LAWYER CALLS THE FINDING 'SLANDER.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Los Angeles Police Officer Theodore J. Briseno probably lied under oath 
during the 1992 Simi Valley trial of officers charged in the beating of Rodney 
G. King, according to the results of a little-known, 10-month investigation 
released Monday by Ventura County prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 But perjury charges will not be filed against him because the testimony did 
not affect the outcome of the trial of Briseno and three fellow officers, 
prosecutors said. The officers were found not guilty of most charges against 
them -- verdicts that sparked rioting in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of Los Angeles police, Ventura County prosecutors reviewed the 
Simi Valley testimony of Briseno, 41, to determine if he had committed perjury. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Ronald C. Janes, who conducted the probe, concluded 
that Briseno apparently lied on April 3, 1992, when he told the Ventura County 
jury that he tried to report the beating of King to superiors shortly after it 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors said they decided against charging Briseno with perjury after 
reviewing numerous court and administrative documents. For a statement to be 
considered perjury, it must have the potential to influence the outcome of the 
case, Janes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although this evidence tends to indicate that Officer Briseno lied, proving 
this beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury would be exceedingly difficult," Janes 
concluded in his 18-page report. 
</P>
<P>
 Harland Braun, Briseno's attorney, criticized the report, the Los Angeles 
Police Department and prosecutors in both counties. Ventura County prosecutors 
conducted the review because Briseno's testimony was given in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they've basically done is use the Ventura County district attorney's 
office to slander him," Braun said of LAPD officials. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD Detective James Miller, the internal affairs sergeant who presented the 
case to prosecutors, declined to comment, saying the issue is a confidential 
personnel matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno also was acquitted of attacking King in a later federal trial, but he 
was nevertheless fired by the LAPD for use of excessive force. Some former 
colleagues have criticized Briseno for saying that officers were "out of 
control" during the 1991 beating. He acknowledged that he put his foot on King, 
who later won a $3.8-million civil award from the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno insisted the action was designed to keep King on the ground so the 
motorist could be arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 His testimony was used in the federal civil rights trial that led to the 
convictions of former Sgt. Stacey C. Koon and former Officer Laurence M. 
Powell. The fourth officer, Timothy E. Wind, was fired two months after the 
King beating but later got a job as a community service officer in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 Braun said that Ventura County prosecutors, by concluding that Briseno 
probably lied but declining to file charges against him, are appeasing those 
who believe in an unwritten "code of silence" against police officers 
testifying against one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno has filed a lawsuit seeking his job back, contending that he was 
wrongfully terminated by the department. 
</P>
<P>
 In the testimony that prompted the perjury investigation, Briseno insisted 
that he drove to a police station and tried to report the incident. Unable to 
find the lieutenant on duty, Briseno testified that he let the matter go 
because Koon had filed a computer message indicating that he was making the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 Other officers on duty that night did not recall Briseno returning to the 
station, looking for the lieutenant or reading Koon's message, the report 
found. A probationary officer riding with Briseno that night told authorities 
that Briseno apparently headed directly to his next call after the beating, the 
report said.

DIMMING THE LIGHT; EDUCATION: INNOVATIVE TUTORING PROGRAM FOR UNDERACHIEVING 
CHILDREN IS ON HOLD AFTER BANK FORCES ITS SPONSOR TO DECLARE BANKRUPTCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The shadow of a grinch dressed in banker's pin stripes hangs over a pioneering 
educational program that has made learning fun for dozens of underachieving 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Project EEXCEL gained national attention two years ago when it opened Academy 
Hall, a South Los Angeles apartment building that provided the children of its 
low-income residents with intensive after-school tutoring and the possibility 
of scholarships to USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the tutoring program is on hold, along with the hope that the children 
will ever make it to USC. The reason is that ITT Commercial Finance Corp., a 
real estate subsidiary of a conglomerate with $70 billion in assets, has forced 
the group that owns the building and sponsors the project to declare bankruptcy 
over a relatively minor tax dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The ambitious effort to help children escape the cycle of poverty that 
ensnares their parents has had some previous ups and downs, and some services 
promised initially -- a day-care program, for example -- have not materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 But for several hours each week, what children such as 14-year-old Michael 
Robertson have been getting is one-on-one attention from USC tutors. And the 
payoff, in some cases, has been dramatic: This past September, Michael, a 
ninth-grader, could not read. Now he can. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a big help to my son," said Diane Rankin, Michael's mother. 
"Before, he was getting Ds and Fs and now he's up to Cs and Bs." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the lender, who acknowledged that he knew very little about 
the issue, declined to comment on his company's action or to explain the reason 
behind it. Other officials who are involved in the matter referred all 
questions to the spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just have a screw-you attitude," said Kent Salveson, the San Juan 
Capistrano developer who, with a partner, founded Project EEXCEL. "They just 
don't care. They don't care about the program or the kids. They don't care 
about anything but getting the property and selling it at a profit." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the tutoring project, the acronym of which stands for Educational 
Excellence for Children With Environmental Limitations, is about $10,000 a 
semester. Salveson said that because of mounting legal fees and other 
unanticipated expenses related to the tax dispute, the income from the building 
barely covers expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 And none is left for extras -- even the sunny, computer-equipped classroom 
well-stocked with books and art supplies that is a haven for children who are 
accustomed to violence and other urban ills born of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Carson, the principal of West Athens School where many of the children 
are enrolled, said the tutoring is desperately needed in a part of the city 
that is often unforgiving. Asked to depict their neighborhood, most of the 
Project EEXCEL students drew scenes of armed robberies and drive-by shootings. 
Asked to show their dreams, they drew pictures of themselves wearing graduation 
gowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wish some others would put something back into the community . . . to 
show that they are genuinely concerned," Carson said. "These kids have a leg up 
on other kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Legal papers filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by ITT show that it loaned 
Salveson $1.55 million in 1992 when he built the 47-unit apartment house on 
South Vermont Avenue at 120th Street. Salveson said he has never missed a 
payment on the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 What is at issue now is about $57,000 in property taxes. Salveson said the 
nonprofit status of his company and the below-market rents he charges exempt 
him from those taxes. But his company has yet to apply for that relief and the 
taxes are overdue. Salveson said he is collecting the documentation needed to 
support the application. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the bank paid the tax obligation and then demanded immediate 
reimbursement. Salveson refused, saying the money was not owed. The bank 
successfully went to court in November to foreclose on the loan and ask for the 
appointment of a $125-per-hour receiver to manage the property until it could 
be sold. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid that, Salveson filed for bankruptcy. Salveson and his attorney 
speculate that the aim of the bank's hardball strategy is to take over the 
building and raise the subsidized rents there to whatever the market will bear, 
making the property far more valuable. Salveson said he offered to repay the 
bank if, eventually, the county rules against his application for an exemption. 
But, he said, the bank has turned the offer down. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer advocates said the bank's unwillingness to be flexible in the matter 
is unusual. "That's not the way any reasonable bank would do business . . . if 
they want to keep the customer," said Harry Snyder, co-director of Consumers 
Union in San Francisco. "It just seems absolutely arbitrary." 
</P>
<P>
 The pioneering educational program caught in the middle of the dispute has 
been hailed for linking schools and students' homes. The key to that 
communication is Julie Barber, the director of the tutoring program, who 
frequently visits the schools where the 35 children who are served by tutors 
are enrolled. The other important element of the program is the close 
relationships that develop between the students and their USC tutors. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are getting the attention that the teachers in the schools don't have 
time to give," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 USC School of Education Dean Guilbert C. Hentschke, who is a Project EEXCEL 
backer, said teachers "really see these kids come alive" as a result of that 
attention. "It's something as simple as having books at home, which they can't 
take home from school because gang members will take them away."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 
INDEPENDENT PROBE OF FIRE DEPARTMENT SHELVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The work of an independent panel appointed to study affirmative action issues 
in the Los Angeles City Fire Department in the wake of a scathing city audit 
has been put on hold because concerns raised in the report already are being 
investigated, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the audit was released last month, the City Council Personnel Committee 
and the Fire Commission have held several hearings on alleged discrimination in 
the department's training and promotion practices and on its treatment of women 
and minorities.The department also has expanded an existing committee to adopt 
recommendations in the audit. 
</P>
<P>
 A sharply divided Fire Commission approved the panel Nov. 22 at the request of 
board President Elizabeth Lowe, who called for the action after being told by 
Fire Chief Donald O. Manning that the audit's findings were inaccurate. Manning 
has put forth his own report containing data that he said contradicts the 
audit. 
</P>
<P>
 But in preliminary observations, Ray's panel found that the audit, although 
not an exhaustive analysis, did provide useful information about perceived 
discrimination problems on the force.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: A REAL-LIFE GRINCH 
STEALS GIFTS FOR DISABLED CHILDREN 
</P>

<P>
 A real-life Grinch slithered into a North Hollywood nonprofit organization and 
stole more than 100 presents intended for children with severe mental and 
emotional disabilities, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the children are wards of the court and were not likely to receive any 
other Christmas gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members of the Dubnoff Center for Child Development and Educational 
Therapy arrived at the center's administrative offices Monday morning to find 
the presents, computer equipment, office furniture and a refrigerator gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the center estimate that the total losses, including the 
presents, was $20,000. Police said the theft occurred sometime during the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "These children have so very little to begin with," said Gil Freitag. "The 
amount of effort and goodwill and expectations that went into the preparation 
of these gifts was enormous, and to have them snatched from under us overnight 
has just been devastating." 
</P>
<P>
 The private agency has worked with children from throughout Los Angeles County 
for 46 years, Freitag said. More than 130 students attend the center's school 
and preschool programs and about 30 live in group homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The live-in children -- who range in age from 12 to 18 -- were asked to make 
lists of things they wanted for Christmas, Freitag said. Some of those items 
were donated and others were bought with donated money and wrapped by staff 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Each child was to receive five presents, including such items as athletic 
shoes, cassette recorders, computer games, walkie-talkies, baseball cards and 
art supplies. Freitag said the gifts were to be a surprise, placed under 
Christmas trees in the group homes on Monday. He added that he will not tell 
the children what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've experienced abandonment in major ways that have destroyed their hope 
that they could ever have a normal, happy, Christmas," Freitag said. "This 
would just confirm their worst fears."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
PUBLIC WARNED OF INFECTION RISK LINKED TO FOLK REMEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County health officials warned Monday of the possibility of contracting a 
potentially fatal bacterial infection from a Latino folk health remedy made up 
of dried, ground rattlesnake. In recent months, three people in Los Angeles 
County have died of a severe bacterial infection caused by a species of 
salmonella commonly found in reptiles, according to the Department of Health 
Services.Two others have been hospitalized.  
</P>
<P>
 In two cases, testing of rattlesnake capsules from the patients' homes showed 
salmonella contamination, health officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Seven other cases of that type of infection were reported this year, and 
health officials said they are investigating whether those patients also took 
the medicine.  
</P>
<P>
 The capsules are used by many Latinos as a remedy for a variety of chronic 
health problemsranging from acne and arthritis to cancer, AIDS and blood 
disorders.  
</P>
<P>
 The folk medicine is readily available in pharmacies serving the Latino 
community, as well as at swap meets, officials said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VAN NUYS; JUDGE IN 
MENENDEZ CASE PUTS OFF SEVERAL RULINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The judge in the Menendez brothers murder case opted Monday to put off rulings 
on several key pretrial issues, among them whether the brothers will be tried 
together or separately. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg has said several times in 
recent weeks that he is inclined to hold a single retrial before one jury.But 
he put off that ruling until Feb. 6 to give defense attorneys more time to 
interview witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisberg set a Jan. 23 hearing on the issue of whether the trial will be held 
in Downtown Los Angeles or in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Also remaining on the agenda is whether attorney Jill Lansing will be 
appointed to represent Lyle Menendez, who is currently being represented by the 
public defender's office. The retrial is scheduled to begin March 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Erik Menendez, now 24, and Lyle Menendez, 26, remain in County Jail without 
bail. The brothers' first trial ended in January with separate juries 
deadlocked between murder and lesser manslaughter charges in the Aug. 20, 1989, 
shotgun slayings of their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez.WEISBERG, STANLEY M

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTH-CENTRAL; 2 PLEAD 
NOT GUILTY IN ALLEGED SCHOOL PROGRAM FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The operators of a South-Central independent study program pleaded not guilty 
in U.S. District Court on Monday to criminal charges of bilking the Los Angeles 
Unified School District out of $730,000 for students who never enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 Trial was set for Jan. 24 for Arnese Clemons, former director of the Institute 
for Successful Living, and Dewey Hughes, a consultant who helped her hire 
teachers.Bail was set at $50,000 each. The two were represented by 
court-appointed attorneys because they could not afford private representation. 
In court papers, Clemons said she now works for World Book Encyclopedia and is 
raising two foster children. Hughes did not list an employer and said he has 
debts of more than $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemons and Hughes were indicted on Dec. 1 for allegedly overstating the 
number of students they were serving in the program between 1988 and 1991. In a 
complicated ruse, the U.S. attorney's office claims, teachers were asked to 
forge absent students' names onto work-completion forms. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the institute allegedly proved it had sufficient teachers to 
instruct those students by interviewing teacher candidates, not hiring them and 
then sending copies of their credentials to the district as if they had been 
hired. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Clemons and Hughes would not comment on the case Monday.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: NORWALK; MAN KILLS 
BROTHER, SELF IN STANDOFF WITH DEPUTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man shot and killed his brother during a standoff with deputies Monday and 
then committed suicide after saying he did not want to go to jail, a Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shootings occurred in a two-bedroom Norwalk house owned by the 46-year-old 
gunman, who lived there with his 43-year-old brother and his brother's 
girlfriend, said sheriff's spokesman George Ducoulombier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Detectives believe a possible motive was the victim . . . physically abusing 
the suspect for a period of time," Ducoulombier said.  
</P>
<P>
 The shootings occurred after deputies were called to the home to try to talk 
to the suspect. While they were at the front door, they heard what sounded like 
someone loading a weapon, possibly a rifle, Ducoulombier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Special Weapons and Tactics deputies and crisis negotiators were then 
summoned. The negotiators contacted the gunman, "who said he had shot his 
brother and did not want to go to jail," Ducoulombier said.  
</P>
<P>
 At 8:48 a.m., the deputies fired tear gas into the home, entered and found the 
bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 The names of the men were withheld pending notification of relatives.  
</P>
<P>
 Ducoulombier said detectives want to question the girlfriend, 47-year-old 
Mariet Showers, who disappeared after running to a neighbor's home at 4:20 a.m. 
to report that a shooting had taken place in the 14300 block of Brink Avenue.

LONG BEACH TENTATIVELY OKS $375,000 SETTLEMENT OF POLICE BEATING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL GOTTESMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long Beach officials have tentatively agreed to pay $375,000 to two brothers 
who said they were handcuffed, beaten and kicked in the driveway of their home 
by police officers investigating a noise complaint nearly nine years ago, it 
was announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement came Thursday after a Superior Court jury in Long Beach found 
the city and officers liable for damages in the incident involving residents 
Guillermo Irigoyen, 50, and his brother, Juan, 43. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury had resumed deliberations to set monetary damages when the two sides 
reached a tentative agreement, which is to be submitted today to the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men suffered injuries to their heads, backs and arms as a result of 
the beatings in June, 1986, according to the complaint, which said they have 
needed continuous psychiatric care since.  
</P>
<P>
 The clash occurred about midnight after police arrived at the Irigoyens' home 
to investigate a disturbing-the-peace call. Officers Phil Candelaria and James 
Creager apparently approached the house's open garage, where the two men were 
listening to music. The policemen did not identify themselves, according to the 
suit. The attorney for the brothers described the uniforms the officers wore as 
ink blue and difficult to see in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 Unaware that the approaching men were officers, Guillermo threatened them with 
a bottle and ordered them off his property. The officers then apprehended the 
brothers, handcuffed them and threw them to the ground. The brothers were 
struck with batons and kicked, according to testimony.  
</P>
<P>
 The Irigoyens were arrested and charged with assaulting a police officer, 
resisting arrest, public intoxication and disturbing the peace. They pleaded no 
contest to disturbing the peace and paid a fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Atty. Robert Shannon said he could not comment on the award 
because the Long Beach City Council had not approved it.

FAMILY OF MAN SLAIN BY DEPUTIES THREATENS TO SUE; LAW: RELATIVES SAY TWO 
OFFICERS WHO SHOT THE GLENDALE MENTAL PATIENT, 30, OVERREACTED. OFFICIALS SAY 
HE LUNGED AT THE PAIR WITH A BROKEN METAL CRUTCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A day after two Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies shot and killed a 
Glendale man menacing them with a broken crutch, the family of the dead man 
threatened legal action, charging that officers overreacted. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies shot at Aaron Cease 12 times as he lunged at them with the jagged 
edge of a broken metal crutch early Sunday in Glendale, according to 
investigators and witnesses. Both the Sheriff's Department and the district 
attorney's office are investigating the shooting, standard practice for deaths 
that involve law enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The identities of the deputies were not released. Sheriff's officials declined 
to comment about the standard procedure that deputies are supposed to use when 
confronted by people who will not yield to verbal commands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want people playing Monday morning quarterback" until all the facts 
are available, said Sgt. Larry Lincoln.  
</P>
<P>
 In general, he said, "We have a lot of options available. . . . We (don't) 
want to paint anybody into a corner." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Bob Taylor, who is investigating the shooting, said Cease -- 6-foot-3 
and 148 pounds -- was "within striking distance" when the deputies opened fire. 
He said that the deputies were carrying pepper spray or Mace and that a field 
supervisor, who was en route, would have had a Taser gun. Taylor refused to 
comment on whether the shooting was appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Cease's sister, Rachel Roberg, said her father, Wesley Cease, was planning to 
sue the Sheriff's Department. Family members said Aaron Cease, 30, suffered 
from "major depression" and had been under a doctor's care for 12 years but had 
never been violent. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was frail -- tall and slender," Roberg said. "I think he could have been 
tackled. . . . I think they just didn't know what to do. They were nervous. It 
was the first thing they thought of." 
</P>
<P>
 Family members speculated that Cease was on his way to a convenience store a 
few blocks from his home at the time of the shooting. Three or four times each 
week, Cease made the trek to the store at Montrose and La Crescenta avenues in 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 He would go to the cash register and ask: "Did my mother call?" If she had, 
the clerks had orders to let Cease buy his cigarettes, coffee or wine on his 
mother's credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew the guy personally. He was a mentally unstable person who wasn't going 
to harm anyone," said Jay Singh, manager of the store.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputies arrived in the 2500 block of Montrose after midnight in response to 
calls from residents and motorists who said they saw Cease swinging the broken 
crutch at pedestrians and parked cars, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Fidel Gonzales said Cease approached the two deputies in a threatening 
manner and began swinging the crutch at them. Despite orders to stop, Cease 
continued toward them, Gonzales said. After the deputies had backed up about 
120 feet with Cease in close quarters, Cease lunged at them and they opened 
fire, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said Monday that they heard one set of shots, a pause and then a 
second stream of shots. Taylor said Cease continued moving toward the deputies 
after the first set of shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Cease's mother, Doreen Cease, said her son had the crutch to help with an 
ankle broken within the last year. Sheriff's deputies disputed that the ankle 
was injured and said there were indications that Cease had been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of a preliminary autopsy conducted Monday will reveal if Cease was 
drunk or whether his ankle had not yet healed.

CSUN SOFTBALL PLAYER HURT IN CRASH LEAVES INTENSIVE CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge softball player Shelby Wilcox, who suffered a skull 
fracture in a car accident Friday night in Morro Bay, has been moved from the 
intensive care unit and could be released from the hospital as early as 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox, 20, was a passenger in teammate Traci Gallian's car when it was hit 
almost head-on by an apparently drunk driver in a pickup truck. That driver 
died Friday night of internal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallian, 19, suffered a broken collarbone and was released from the hospital 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has told me I'm lucky to be alive," Wilcox said Monday from the 
Sierra Vista Regional Medical Center in San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 After the accident, Wilcox did not regain consciousness for nearly a day, and 
on Monday still could not remember anything from the afternoon of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 But doctors told her to expect a full recovery from the injuries, which also 
include a shattered right thigh bone and a broken hand. The skull fracture did 
not injure her brain. A metal rod was inserted into her leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have mixed emotions as to why the crash had to happen," Wilcox said. "I 
feel like I've been gypped of the next six months of my life. My goals with 
softball and school (can't happen)." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox, a junior outfielder, batted .323 in 31 at-bats last season to help the 
Matadors advance to the NCAA championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 She will probably miss most or all of the upcoming season, which lasts from 
February to May. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Monday that they would have filed felony drunk driving charges 
against the driver of the truck, Roberto Elizarraraz, had he survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizarraraz, 58, of Los Osos had no driver's license or automobile insurance, 
Detective Dan Hubbell of the Morro Bay Police Department said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The collision occurred on California 1 when Elizarraraz was driving south in 
the northbound lane, authorities said. He was traveling about 50 m.p.h. when he 
hit Gallian's car. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallian and Wilcox were en route to teammate Kathy Blake's wedding in 
Atascadero, a coastal town about 20 miles north of San Luis Obispo. Hubbell 
said their lives were probably saved because they wore seat belts.

CHRIS FOSTER: THIS TRIP IS NO GIFT FROM SANTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chris Foster 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when reality took 
hold. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Something about chasing the beast east can cause a lot of fear and loathing. 
Mater Dei's basketball team does Las Vegas this week for the Holiday Prep 
Classic. That would be the Reebok Holiday Prep Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 It's more than just a tournament. It's a marketing bonanza. No fewer than 50 
teams, many reputed to be the best in the nation (with a few tomato cans tossed 
in) are gathered to perpetuate the myth that a national high school sports 
forum is a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there's nothing wrong with the Monarchs picking on some people their own 
shoe size for a change. But why are they here? Why is any team here? 
</P>
<P>
 Did I mention this is the Reebok Holiday Prep Classic? 
</P>
<P>
 Teams from Washington (D.C. and the state), the South (three Alabama schools 
alone) and Canada are here to try their luck. There's even a group from some 
Northern Exposure tundra (East Anchorage). Why? See previous paragraph. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, what will USA Today do if a Vancouver team wins? No. 1 in the 
continent? 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly this illustrious field will produce a consensus No. 1. Again, is 
that a good thing? 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly. The winner here is on Planet Reebok. 
</P>
<P>
 Again that corporate wallet has been opened and everyone stuck out their hand. 
But nothing comes for free. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it can be said that a little corporate involvement is a good thing. It may 
be, as long as it remains on a small, give-back-to-the-community scale. But 
these brutes want their pound of flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody out there remember "Fab 40" tournament put on by Nike a year ago? Nice 
idea getting 40 of the "top" high school players together for some fun and 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 It would have been a nicer idea if Nike officials had checked with a few state 
athletic federations to see if it was OK for players to participate. Seems many 
states had problems with a shoe-company tournament in September, not to mention 
the airfare, meals, lodging, $500 worth of equipment and $100 gift certificates 
for the company store -- all on the house. Some players were even suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 Rules schmules, Nike was looking to get in on the ground floor for tomorrow's 
shoe salesmen. Why, what if Shaquille O'Neal had been better groomed as a 
15-year-old? Not as a player, but as a pitchman? 
</P>
<P>
 Now Reebok wasn't about to be left standing agape while Nike just did it. They 
came here in full force. Gobs of goodies were stacked on tables waiting, and 
credit card machines were humming. 
</P>
<P>
 It's safe to say shoe company officials are not high on the food chain. But 
they have the cash to create a national high school sports arena. They've 
sucked professional and college basketball dry. They've already bored from 
below with somewhat seedy traveling teams. 
</P>
<P>
 And they are already at work on the high school level. Wasn't that Nike (Mater 
Dei) beating Adidas (Tustin) in the Tournament of Champions final? At least 
according to those spiffy clothes the players were wearing when they arrived 
for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Now come the mega-tournaments. The next couple weeks will be filled with them. 
Why? Well everyone wants to be No. 1, don't they? 
</P>
<P>
 Heck, just last week in a Sports Illustrated story about the highly subjective 
USA Today poll, Rialto Eisenhower football Coach Tom Hoak said: "In high school 
sports, you really haven't accomplished anything unless you're the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Did Tom miss a few education classes? 
</P>
<P>
 Well the quest for No. 1 is under way in Las Vegas. Can the Monarchs grab that 
brass ring? It doesn't matter. They'll get another crack. 
</P>
<P>
 Tune in next week for the Reebok Above the Rim Tournament in San Diego. Just 
the next stop for this medicine show.

 Newport Harbor's three-game victory over Stockton St. Mary's in the State 
Division I volleyball championship also ended an era. 
</P>
<P>
 Four-year starters Misty May and Melissa Schutz -- who had helped the Sailors 
win the State Division III championship in 1992 and reach the State Division I 
final in 1993 -- were two of the 10 Newport Harbor seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure there are a lot of Orange County coaches glad to see them go, but I 
know there's at least one sad one," Sailor Coach Dan Glenn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor finished 33-1, lost only one of 13 games during the State 
tournament, and scored the most lopsided victory in Southern Section major 
division final history with a 15-5, 15-1, 15-7 victory over Mira Costa -- the 
state's second-ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a similarly bittersweet feeling at Calvary Chapel after it beat 
Miramonte Orinda to win the State Division IV title. 
</P>
<P>
 Courtney Owens and Sara Roberts -- both four-year starters -- and senior Lynn 
Lovingier are among those who helped the program win its first girls' 
volleyball State title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have mixed emotions," Coach Jim Downey said. "You're happy because you won, 
but it will be hard to see them go."

 Talk about your full-court press, Erika Tillman turned in the play of the day 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth quarter of Dana Hills' 39-33 basketball victory over Troy, play 
was stopped because there was a wet spot in front of the Troy bench. While Troy 
Coach Brad Sand and his players tried to dry the spot with the soles of their 
shoes, Tillman ran to the spot, dropped on her seat, and rubbed back and forth, 
getting the job done in more efficient manner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The winter sports season has brought with it several injuries. Troy, ranked 
No. 10 in The Times' preseason poll, lost Mississippi-bound center Jennie Gadd 
for five games because of a sprained ankle, but she should be able to play 
Wednesday against Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 Players who won't be back so quickly include Servite's Mark Seaton, a 6-9 
Stanford-bound center who broke a small bone in his right foot in Saturday's 
63-55 loss to Nogales in the Tournament of Champions. Seaton is out eight to 10 
weeks; he could return for the playoffs, but the Friars will probably have to 
get there without him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within the week we'll decide what form of treatment to choose, and that will 
affect whether he can come back in 10 weeks or eight," said Mark's father, 
Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley girls' basketball was dealt a similar blow with the loss of 
guard Kim Brown for the season with torn ligaments in her left knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Another player faced with reconstructive knee surgery is San Clemente's Kate 
Turnbull, a 5-10 forward who gave the Tritons hope for being better than 
expected.

 Los Alamitos softball coach Jami Shannon owns racehorses with her husband, 
Mark. One, Brotherly, won three consecutive stakes races, including two 
victories over the two-time defending world champion, Refrigerator, before 
Saturday's $250,000 Champion of Champions race at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 Brotherly finished in a dead heat for second place, losing by a nose to 
Refrigerator in a photo finish. Brotherly is one of three nominees for World 
Champion by the American Quarterhorse Assn. in March.

 Brotherly on Sunday was named the 1994 Champion Aged Gelding for horses four 
years and older.

NEWS ANALYSIS; DOCUMENT SEIZURE PUTS D.A. ON CENTER COURT; INQUIRY: CAPIZZI 
WAITED TWO WEEKS TO ENTER O.C. FRAY. SOME LAUD HIS CAUTIOUS APPROACH; OTHERS 
QUESTION DELAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The decision by Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi -- who has maintained a 
decidedly low profile for the past two weeks -- to seize a vanload of documents 
from the county Monday moves his office abruptly from the sidelines onto center 
court in the bankruptcy disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in legal and political circles had been waiting to see how Capizzi, a man 
who built his reputation pursuing public corruption, would weigh in on the 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing is a political minefield. But it's an area in which Mike 
Capizzi has an incredible amount of acumen. He's smart, and he's moved to stake 
out his position -- once he decided that it wouldn't be political suicide," 
said William J. Kopeny, a veteran defense attorney and former public defender. 
</P>
<P>
 But for some critics, Monday's move was too late in coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're into our third week in this now, and where has the D.A. been?" asked 
Mark P. Petracca, an associate professor of political science at UC Irvine. 
"One might have imagined he would have (taken a more aggressive role) right 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the county declared bankruptcy Dec. 6, Capizzi's office has stayed clear 
of the fray, refusing to acknowledge whether it was investigating the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and at least three other 
agencies launched formal probes, Orange County prosecutors insisted they were 
merely "reviewing" the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators did speak last week with several financial officers from around 
the county, but Robert Cornelius, assistant superintendent for business 
services for the Saddleback Valley Unified School District, said the interview 
was brief and the district attorney's representative was "kind of apologetic 
for stopping by and checking with us." 
</P>
<P>
 But that low-key approach turned aggressive Monday, as district attorney's 
officials spent most of the day executing search warrants at the offices of the 
Orange County treasurer and the auditor-controller, seeking documents that 
might reveal whether the nation's biggest municipal bankruptcy entailed any 
criminal wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 While his investigators worked behind a yellow tape cordon at county offices a 
block away, Capizzi maintained his conservative posture, declining to provide 
details on the scope or aim of his investigation as he fielded questions at a 
hastily called afternoon news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not our custom or practice to provide road maps" for where 
investigations are going, he said. "We're not confining our focus to any 
particular (area of the law). . . . We're analyzing all aspects of this 
matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi made his mark as a deputy district attorney in the 1970s in the 
prosecution of more than three dozen Orange County political corruption cases. 
</P>
<P>
 With that experience behind him, Kopeny said he believes the district attorney 
realized the need to assess the potential legal and political fallout from a 
high-profile case before rushing in. 
</P>
<P>
 But Capizzi obviously concluded that the gains outweigh the risks. "He's 
decided not to let anyone -- the Feds or the state -- take over the high ground 
from him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder: "It's important for all concerned to get 
to the bottom of everything. If it takes a search warrant to do it, then so be 
it. If the treasurer and auditor didn't do anything wrong, they shouldn't feel 
bothered by this." 
</P>
<P>
 Observers said a successful prosecution in the internationally known case 
could provide a much-needed boost in public relations for the district 
attorney's office, which has suffered a string of recent setbacks. Most 
prominent was the decision this fall to file and then drop charges against a 
suspect in the Laguna Beach fires who turned out to have been in a Mexican jail 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 But there may be political risks for Capizzi as well, since Monday's search 
warrants have already caused signs of friction among some of his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley appeared frustrated to see yet 
another agency taking an active role in the bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 And one top county official who asked not to be identified grumbled aloud over 
why Capizzi wanted copies Monday of a 1993 audit that was critical of Citron's 
management practices. County supervisors have been pilloried for not acting on 
the audit, but the official said: "He got that report too, and he didn't do 
anything. You've got to ask the question, why now?" 
</P>
<P>
 UCI's Petracca maintained that such tensions can color a sensitive 
investigation because the district attorney's office falls under county 
jurisdiction and must work with other branches of government on budget and 
management issues. 
</P>
<P>
 That may explain, Petracca contended, why the district attorney often allows 
other agencies to take the lead public role in corruption cases such as the 
influence-peddling investigation of former Supervisor Don R. Roth. The FBI 
moved out front publicly at the beginning of the case, but the district 
attorney ultimately convicted Roth on seven ethics violations. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bankruptcy case, the SEC's probe was promptly followed by others 
launched by the Justice Department, the state Department of Corporations and 
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, before Capizzi announced his own 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really the district attorneys' (modus operandi) in Orange County . . 
. to wait until some other agency steps in before going after it themselves," 
Petracca said. "But this is a pretty big event -- they don't get much bigger. . 
. . So eventually, you look a little silly in the eyes of a public that's angry 
as hell if you don't do anything about it."

D.A. SEIZES INVESTMENT RECORDS; CRISIS: FOCUS OF THE ACTION APPEARS TO BE TO 
SEEK INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT AGENCIES WERE TOLD ABOUT RISKS. OFFICES OF THE O.C. 
TREASURER AND AUDITOR ARE TARGETED. 
</P>

<P>
 Armed with search warrants, investigators from the Orange County district 
attorney's office scoured the offices of the county's treasurer and auditor 
Monday, launching a criminal probe into the risky investment practices that 
plunged the county into an unprecedented bankruptcy crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Sealing off the hallway leading to former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. 
Citron's office with yellow crime-scene tape, about 35 investigators -- 
including some from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the State 
Department of Corporations -- combed through files, removing boxes of documents 
and computers, which were loaded into two vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nearby government building, authorities collected audits of the 
investment portfolio conducted by Auditor-Controller Steve E. Lewis. 
Investigators, he said, were particularly interested in a 1993 audit that 
criticized Citron's investment strategies and said state laws were being 
violated. 
</P>
<P>
 Affidavits supporting the search warrants are believed to recount interviews 
between investigators and several city officials around the county, zeroing in 
on how cities first became involved in the county pool and whether they were 
ever warned that the fund was in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 At the treasurer's office, investigators appeared to be focusing on documents 
that could shed light on Citron's investments and precisely what cities, 
schools and special districts with savings in the fund were told about the 
risks of those investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said they would be collecting documents from the treasurer's 
office throughout Monday night and were expected to return today. While the 
probe continued, these developments took place Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 * County officials said they were preparing to cut about 25% out of this 
year's budget because of the loss of interest revenue. The cuts, however, will 
not be shared equally among county departments. Public safety and welfare 
services are a higher priority, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 * At the urging of the county's management council -- comprised of Dist. Atty. 
Michael R. Capizzi, Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, Sheriff Brad Gates and Health 
Services Agency Director Tom Uram -- the Superior Court system offered to trim 
$1 million from its budget, largely by allowing 35 to 45 jobs to remain 
unfilled, according to Assistant Presiding Judge Ted Millard. Officials in 
other county departments declined to comment on possible cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salomon Bros., the brokerage handling the liquidation of the fund's 
portfolio, said the fund will receive $598 million in cash from the $1.39 
billion raised in last week's initial sale. The rest of the proceeds -- $792 
million -- were used to pay down some of the loans still outstanding to the 
fund from major brokerage houses. Meanwhile, the brokerage on Monday sold an 
additional $175 million in securities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Investors in the county fund learned that property taxes collected earlier 
this month will be released Friday to all public agencies. "We're seeing step 
by step that we're going to see a resolution to this," said Blake Anderson, 
general manager of the Orange County Sanitation District, which will receive 
about $20 million in property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it had filed a motion 
that allows it to be a formal part of the bankruptcy proceedings and monitor 
the distribution of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Sacramento, a special Senate committee held its first meeting to look 
into the Orange County investment debacle and several lawmakers raised doubts 
that the state can offer much assistance. "I've got a feeling a lot of these 
local governments are going to come up here with their hands out and ask us to 
bail them out," said Sen. Daniel E. Boatwright (D-Concord). "We don't have the 
money to bail them out. . . . We're in a hole." 
</P>
<P>
 * The City of Anaheim turned down an $8.5-million disbursement offered by the 
county because city officials did not want to be restricted to spending the 
money on emergency payroll and purchasing commitments, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 * A federal bankruptcy judge approved $126.6 million in disbursements to some 
investors who sought money from the pool. Among the disbursements were $115 
million to the Orange County Department of Education, community colleges and 
other schools, and $4.6 million to the Orange County Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 * At a Huntington Beach City Council meeting, outgoing Councilman Jim Silva, 
who will be sworn in next month as one of two new county supervisors, said his 
first action will be to propose that the county treasurer be appointed and not 
elected. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva said the treasurer should be selected by the county chief administrative 
officer and approved by the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 At an impromptu news conference Monday afternoon, Capizzi said the two search 
warrants were the only ones executed in the case so far but refused to rule out 
future warrants. Nor would he discuss the scope or aim of his case. "We're not 
giving road maps (on the investigation), past or future," he said, adding that 
investigators would not limit their inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office joins a host of other agencies -- including the 
U.S. attorney's office and the Securities and Exchange Commission -- that are 
examining Citron's investments in the wake of the county's bankruptcy filing 
two weeks ago. Much of the investigation focuses on whether Citron misled 
investors and whether brokers sought to influence county officials to gain 
underwriting business by providing them with kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry W. Bird, attorney for Acting Treasurer Matthew R. Raabe, said Monday's 
actions by Capizzi's office were unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a criminal case. Why he's executing search warrants on the 
treasurer's office, you'll have to ask him," Bird said. "Somebody decided they 
need to seal it off with a yellow tape. That was not necessary. These people 
would have given them anything they wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, two district attorney's investigators had been rebuffed in 
attempts to speak with Raabe. But investigators did talk with finance officials 
from several cities, including Irvine. City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. said they 
were looking for any documentation or verbal representations on the risk to 
their investments made by Citron and Raabe. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, the county auditor-controller, said he had "nothing to fear" from a 
criminal investigation. "My records are open," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators arrived at the county offices about 10 a.m. Salomon Bros. 
officials also were present, said an investigator who declined to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 13 boxes, numbered and labeled "Treas.," were loaded into an orange 
van. Computers and other boxes were loaded into a second vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Also at the scene was Deputy Dist. Atty. William Overtoom, who specializes in 
prosecuting white-collar crime, including fraud and embezzlement. Overtoom 
declined to discuss his involvement in the execution of the search warrants. 
</P>
<P>
 County employees gathered a short distance from the commotion. "It's like a 
morgue in there: terrible, terrible, terrible," said Rena Bugbee, a deputy tax 
collector. 
</P>
<P>
 As public agencies continued to cope with the fallout from the financial 
crisis, Ron Rus, an attorney who represents six local districts with money tied 
up in the fund, described the emergency disbursement of $126 million in funds 
as "a very interim stop-gap measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't view the amount disbursed on Monday as having any significant impact 
on the interests of other participants in the pool," Rus added. Priority Sought 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, officials from some agencies who mistakenly believed their funds 
were being invested in a separate, safer pool were preparing to argue that they 
should be among the first in line to get their money back. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, the Orange County Transportation Agency, Orange County Sanitation 
District and 11 other public entities were shown in county documents as having 
invested $1.3 billion in a "bond pool" as distinguished from a "commingled 
pool." 
</P>
<P>
 In actuality, it appears as if Citron pooled all funds in one investment fund 
comprised of numerous high-risk investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly stung by the revelation that apparently no safer pool of funds 
existed was the county sanitation district, which invested about $50 million in 
what officials believed was safe on assurances from Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 An April 12, 1993, letter from Citron to district general manager J. Wayne 
Sylvester all but guaranteed that the money would be safe, indicating that it 
was not going into a "commingled fund," but into a separate one with lower 
risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are doing the district an extreme favor," Citron said in the letter. "We, 
therefore, do not want this type of investment transaction disseminated to 
others." 
</P>
<P>
 The confusion over the existence of separate funds was worsened by monthly 
statements from Citron charting performances for both a "bond pool" and an 
"investment pool," the latter believed to have been the higher-risk pool of 
commingled funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Oftelie, chief executive officer of the Orange County Transportation 
Authority, said, "We believed that the bond pool had safer, lower yield 
investments and the commingled pool had riskier investments." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are supposed to be two pools," said Ken Weel, chief financial officer 
for the Santa Margarita Water District, one of the 13 agencies. "We got 
separate statements on each pool." 
</P>
<P>
 The distinction between the two funds is significant because, under federal 
law, the tax-exempt monies that were pumped into the pool by the 13 agencies 
cannot be used for arbitrage, borrowing to make a profit. In exchange for 
assuming lower risks, the agencies would receive a lower rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials first received indications that their so-called "safe" deposits 
would be tied up in the financial mess at an investors meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also questioned the propriety of Citron's pooling all the money in a 
single fund, thus subjecting them to the same amount of risk, but paying some 
agencies lower yields.

 Citron's attorney, David Wiechert, did not return telephone calls Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick C. Shea, an attorney with Pillsbury Madison & Sutro, which has been 
retained by a committee of investors seeking return of their money, said it is 
unclear how Citron's accounting methods will affect the disbursement of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Shea said he does not expect the possible claims by some investors that their 
funds are more secure to disrupt the negotiation process or fracture the 
investors committee. Unlike committees in other types of bankruptcy filings, 
"the members of this committee are county agencies and they all live here and 
they're all neighbors forever. It's like they're all married," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shea added that he expects all the investors will receive pro-rated shares of 
money that came into county coffers after the bankruptcy declaration was filed, 
such as recently received property tax revenue. School districts were given 
special assurances from the Board of Supervisors over the weekend that they 
would receive their fair shares of the property tax payments, but Shea said 
other investors should receive the same treatment. Anaheim Decision 
</P>
<P>
 While municipalities throughout the county clamored for cash, Bret Colson, 
spokesman for the City of Anaheim, said officials there turned down an 
$8.5-million disbursement offered by the county because the money could be 
spent only on emergency payroll and purchasing commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is not in emergency mode with respect to payroll and purchasing," 
Colson said. "If (the county) hadn't put any restrictions on it, we would have 
accepted the money to meet general operating expenses." 
</P>
<P>
 Colson said city officials will re-evaluate their position on the disbursement 
after Christmas. The city has $169 million invested in the fund, 20% of its 
total investment portfolio of $874 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana, which defaulted on a $5.3-million debt service last week , will 
learn later this week if the county will release the $9.6 million the city 
needs to continue a massive jail construction project. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get the money this week, we'll be fine, " City Manager David N. Ream 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will be forced to halt the project if it cannot come up with the debt 
service payment and the $4.5 million in contractor's fees that are due this 
month. County's Cash Intake 
</P>
<P>
 As creditors continued to pick through the financial wreckage this week, the 
county's advisers -- the Salomon Bros. brokerage house -- revealed that the 
county's investment portfolio will take in only $598 million in cash from the 
$1.39 billion it raised in last week's initial sale of securities. The balance 
-- $792 million -- went to pay down some of the loans still outstanding to the 
fund from major brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon also said Monday that it had failed to count $390 million in loans in 
its initial valuation of the fund a week ago, when it estimated the total loan 
amount at $2.56 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But Salomon said that because the $390 million loan it missed was fully 
collateralized, the gross market value of the securities in the fund -- listed 
last week as $7.96 billion -- also was undercounted by $390 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The end result, the brokerage said, is a wash. The original $5.03 billion that 
Salomon estimated could be recovered for the fund by liquidating its securities 
still is accurate, the brokerage said. If that much is raised, the fund's 
investors will have lost 27% of their investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon raised the additional $175 million for the fund Monday by selling a 
handful of securities. Negotiations are continuing between Salomon and the U.S. 
government agencies that issued the bulk of the more complicated "derivative" 
bonds owned by the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon hopes to restructure those securities with the agencies rather than 
sell them on the open market, but officials on both sides say they aren't sure 
they can strike a deal before January.

 Sweat glistened on Nutty Boy's fuzzy lip as he dumped the dregs of his cocaine 
into a jar of steaming water. 
</P>
<P>
 A 17-year-old high school dropout, pudgy underneath an oversized T-shirt and 
sagging jeans, he is Los Angeles' typical crack dealer. He lives with his aunt 
in a decaying cluster of South-Central apartments. He drives an American sedan 
punctured with bullet holes. He once had a $100-a-week job planting trees, but 
discovered he could pocket that in a few hours if he was willing to risk jail 
or death. 
</P>
<P>
 With a kitchen mitt, he set the glass container inside a blackened saucepan, 
heating the solution until it lumped up into a pale, gray, gum-sized wad. In 
less than a minute, a teaspoon of worthless crumbs from the bottom of his stash 
had been recycled into a $40 rock -- a simple chemical reaction that can be 
redeemed on almost any corner for instant cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pay my bills with this, keep myself dressed, eat every day and put gas in 
my car," said Nutty Boy, before running out to peddle his creation. "I ain't 
really trying to be no big bad king of L.A. dope dealers. It's more like a 
temporary way of getting by." 
</P>
<P>
 In the mythology of urban Los Angeles, crack has bestowed fantastic wealth on 
an army of Uzi-toting gangbangers, teen-age Darth Vaders battling over the 
blood money that floods their lawless streets. So lucrative is their trade, 
according to popular imagination, that thousands of youths have eschewed honest 
work for thick rolls of $100 bills, mocking a society of clock-punchers as they 
flaunt their beepers and fat gold chains. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic reality of crack's hold on Los Angeles is a far grimmer picture 
-- a poisonous mirage that promises riches for the destitute, but instead lures 
them down an even more virulent path. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last decade, millions of dollars have flowed through the most depressed 
inner-city communities, only to evaporate like an addict's high. Rather than a 
ticket out of poverty, the crack business has amounted to a harsh underground 
economy, a fast-food drug trade financing the mundane basics of working-class 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Swarming legions of peddlers, brazenly parading their wares, have become 
fixtures of a bleak curbside marketplace, flagging down cars and pouncing on 
customers everywhere from the meanest Pico-Union tenement to the farthest 
corner of the San Fernando Valley. Night and day, hawking and haggling and 
hustling, they turn residential streets into open-air drug bazaars, verdant 
parks into treacherous battlefields, abandoned buildings into fetid smoke 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
 At a ramshackle recycling center in South-Central, gaunt addicts eliminate the 
middleman, exchanging shopping carts full of cans and bottles directly for 
their next rock. In the cheesy motels along Figueroa Street, the drug has 
devalued human flesh to what must be an all-time low. On the bustling fringes 
of MacArthur Park, crack is the vortex of a full-fledged black market -- along 
with fraudulent green cards, pirated telephone calling cards and unlicensed 
gypsy cabs -- all taxed by street gangs who charge a daily "rent" of $20 to $40 
per merchant. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you plan on profiting, you got to take it like a serious job," said Nutty 
Boy, still hunched over the kitchen stove, just a few steps from a group of 
neighborhood children in the living room watching after-school cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the 1st to the 5th, that's when most of the money rolls in, when the 
county checks arrive," he explained, estimating that he can take in as much as 
$1,000 a day after his customers receive their welfare benefits. By the end of 
the month, though, the cash usually is long gone, which means Nutty Boy also 
must scrape to get by. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they get paid, I get paid," he said, inspecting the lowly lump of crack 
he just pasted together. "Right now, I'll probably have to give all of this out 
on credit." 
</P>
<P>
 No other drug has ever been marketed this way, or become so thoroughly 
enmeshed in the community's economic fabric. Unlike marijuana or heroin, whose 
effects generally sate the user for hours or even days, crack's short-lived 
high commands the addict to return again and again as often as money will allow 
-- a relentless cycle of misery nurtured and exploited for commercial gain. 
</P>
<P>
 When measured in $20 rocks, the drug may seem inexpensive, which is what lures 
both the seller and buyer so readily into the trade. But there's nothing cheap 
about a business that strips consumers of everything they own, fills prisons 
with tens of thousands of bodies and sparks shocking spasms of violence, some 
of it racially charged, as traffickers vie over the scarce resources in their 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sucker's game all around," said Earl Massey, 41, a former dealer and 
recovering addict, who ended up living by candlelight, cooking by campfire and 
burning the walls in his four-bedroom Pomona home for heat. "The dealers become 
hooked just like the addicts: They're both a slave to the business, doing 
whatever the drug demands them to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Far from a Mafia of ghetto godfathers, most crack dealers are small fish on 
the drug's international food chain, the last retail link in an industry 
ultimately controlled by South America's iron-fisted cartels. The median wage, 
according to a landmark 1989 RAND Corp. study of traffickers in Washington, 
amounts to just $721 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if a few manage to make it big, they usually fall victim to the 
vicissitudes of an illicit, cash-only world, without the benefits of insurance 
or credit. If their profit isn't consumed by food and shelter, it's invariably 
seized by police, consumed by legal fees, stolen by rivals or squandered on 
conspicuous excesses that do nothing to enhance long-term economic health. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of 20,000 gang members I've known, I can count on one hand the number who 
make enough from dope to cover a $600 apartment and a $400 car payment and take 
care of their old lady and kids," said Jim Galipeau, a veteran Los Angeles 
County probation officer in the department's Metropolitan Specialized Gang 
Unit. "Most of them would give it all up for a righteous $8-an-hour job with 
medical and dental." 
</P>
<P>
 In an era of shrinking legitimate prospects, however, crack has become an 
equal-opportunity alternative, the employer of last resort in many of Los 
Angeles' poorest neighborhoods. It is the domain not just of gangbangers and 
criminal misfits, but of laid-off factory workers who'll never recoup their 
union wages in an age of global competition, impressionable teen-agers who've 
been told they need sneakers with triple-digit prices to be cool, single moms 
who can't pay the rent on single incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of them end up becoming addicts themselves, selling just enough of the 
drug to support their own habit. But for most dealers, it's merely a commodity, 
a means to an end, which they'd gladly exchange for widgets if that would 
generate the same rewards. In its own nefarious way, crack has created a new 
sub-class of urban entrepreneurs -- high-risk capitalists who speak not of 
breaking the law, but of "getting paid." 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew people who were doing it, but I said never," recalled a former crack 
dealer known as Arnell, who had the benefit of a stable, middle-class childhood 
in Inglewood, a parochial school diploma and three years of Navy service that 
qualified him for work as a Northrop technician. "It was kind of like a moral 
thing. I knew it just wasn't right." 
</P>
<P>
 But Arnell's sense of morality proved no match for necessity's demands. Six 
months after landing his $11.20-an-hour aerospace job, he was broke -- one of 
thousands laid off in 1986 after Northrop failed to sell its troubled F-20 
fighter jet to the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 Day after day, Arnell said, he looked for work without luck. His bills were 
stacking up. His supply of instant noodles, the staple of his cupboard, was 
running low. He fell a month behind on his $455 rent. It didn't help that his 
childhood friends, most of whom had begun peddling crack while he was in the 
military, were now living in nicer apartments, driving nicer cars, wearing 
nicer clothes and eating nicer meals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still had the idea that I was going to find a real job," said Arnell, a 
solemn, soft-spoken, 29-year-old father of three. "But I had to get paid." 
</P>
<P>
 His initiation -- merely delivering half a kilo for his buddies -- netted him 
$1,000 in cash. With their help, he was soon dressing in silk Italian suits, 
driving a turbo Porsche and dropping $5,000 a hand on blackjack at Caesars 
Palace. By the following year, he had been shot with an Uzi during a drug heist 
and lost a home in Rancho Cucamonga to a money-laundering scam. He also watched 
his cousin, a former firefighter whom he occasionally supplied with drugs, turn 
into a destitute addict scrounging for his next rock on Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when it began to wear on my conscience, when I saw what the drugs were 
actually doing," said Arnell, who was lucky enough to salvage $12,000 in crack 
profits and buy himself a big-rig. Today, he still has a bullet lodged in his 
shoulder, but his cousin is clean, and Arnell now supports his wife and kids 
hauling coal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the glitter and thought it was gold," he said. "But it's a game that 
nobody wins. It ain't designed for that. I was stupid and fell into the trap." 
</P>
<P>
 The crack trade has not just realigned inner-city commerce, it has infiltrated 
virtually every stratum of the Southern California economy -- from cellular 
phone companies to paraphernalia manufacturers to the American banking system. 
</P>
<P>
 Drugs literally have touched so much money here that at least three-quarters 
of all bills in circulation are estimated to have trace amounts of cocaine. The 
Los Angeles branch of the Federal Reserve Bank has now surpassed Miami as the 
nation's cash-surplus leader -- an indicator, according U.S. Treasury agents, 
of the billions of dollars in profit that traffickers are laundering into 
legitimate channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the money passes through legal businesses, such as BMW dealers and 
Rolex merchants, who capitalize on crack's symbiotic relationship with the 
mainstream economy. But some white-collar crooks have gone out of their way to 
cater to drug lords, such as the proprietors of AMS Auto Sales, a La Cienega 
Boulevard dealership that routinely sold $60,000 luxury sedans for suitcases 
full of $100 bills -- sometimes even for kilos of cocaine -- no questions 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind, they're equally if not more culpable than the actual drug 
dealers," said former Assistant U.S. Atty. Michael Fitzgerald, who prosecuted 
the AMS owners. "The people who get involved in that end of the business are 
very sophisticated and intelligent -- the exact sort of people who could easily 
have made a legitimate living." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers have made millions representing suspected traffickers, even though 
they risk losing their fees if it can be proven that the money came from 
illicit sources. Westside attorney Alan Fenster -- who defended Freeway Ricky 
Ross, one of Los Angeles' richest cocaine dealers -- said his own discomfort 
over "profiting from these ill-begotten proceeds" helped persuade him to 
abandon his practice for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The law enforcement community has similarly tasted the riches of cocaine -- in 
ways both beneficial and corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 Police agencies have reaped so much money in asset forfeitures, for example, 
that when Burbank Chief David P. Newsham dedicated his city's new heliport in 
September, he jokingly thanked narcotics dealers for being "good enough to pay 
their share." 
</P>
<P>
 But the temptation to grab a share of drug profits also brought down nearly 
the entire anti-narcotics team of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
in the 1980s. At last count, more than two dozen deputies had been convicted in 
the worst money-skimming scandal in local law enforcement history. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still demonize the people standing on the street corner with a bag in 
their hand, or the mythical godfather-type running the show, but the truth is . 
. . everybody's suspect," said ex-Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas Hagemann, the 
lead prosecutor in the case. "I suppose it's about as powerful as any 
temptation we know." 
</P>
<P>
 If a well-trained, middle-class professional sworn to uphold the law can 
succumb, it takes even less for a defiant teen-ager who feels the deck already 
is stacked against him. Nowhere has that theme echoed more hauntingly than in 
South-Central Los Angeles, where crack's impact was felt first and probably 
fiercest. 
</P>
<P>
 Although crack now touches almost every corner of the region, South-Central's 
long history of economic deprivation, racial oppression and social isolation 
left it particularly susceptible to the drug's financial lure. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you come from having nothing, and everyone around you has nothing, 
what's wrong? I mean what's really considered wrong ?" said DJ Pooh, one of 
South-Central's hottest-selling rap producers, who bought his first turntable a 
decade ago with crack profits. "When pushed, all people -- and I mean all 
people -- are animals. They'll do whatever's necessary to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 The drug's arrival was paved by a wave of deindustrialization that convulsed 
the Southern California economy in the late 1970s and early 1980s, wiping out 
tens of thousands of high-wage factory jobs made obsolete by foreign 
competition. At the same time, Los Angeles' safety net of social programs was 
being slashed by Proposition 13 and Reagan Administration cutbacks, more bad 
news for the unskilled and unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, economists say that Los Angeles' work force has grown only more 
polarized, with new jobs being created in the high-paying technical fields and 
minimum-wage service sector -- but little in between. In South-Central Los 
Angeles, according to U.S. Census data, that translated into just a 6.5% gain 
in per capita income during the 1980s, while an increase of 14.8% was posted 
citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can be as strong as you want and have the best values in the world," said 
Karen Bass, executive director of the Community Coalition for Substance Abuse 
Prevention and Treatment. "But there's nothing that destabilizes a family 
quicker than unemployment and nothing that destroys an individual's self-esteem 
like not being able to feed their own children." 
</P>
<P>
 Into that void flowed a new cut-rate stimulant, potent, compact, durable and 
neatly packaged in units small enough for anyone to afford -- "like McDonald's 
bringing 15-cent hamburgers to everyone on the streets," said U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Administration special agent John Marcello. 
</P>
<P>
 Crack tapped into a market that was hungry for smokable cocaine, serving up a 
drug that was easier and less hazardous to use than earlier freebase methods. 
But crack was also invented as a scheme to expand the market at a time when a 
glut of cocaine threatened to drive prices downward. Although the identities of 
those who concocted the formula remain unclear, there's no doubting the 
effectiveness of their ploy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were going to introduce a new product and wanted cheap labor and huge 
profits -- without advertising, investment or infrastructure -- you wouldn't 
look in Beverly Hills," said J. Eugene Grigsby, director of UCLA's Center for 
African American Studies. "From the perspective of a pure marketing analysis, 
the conditions in most African American urban areas were ripe to spawn an 
alternative economic structure." 
</P>
<P>
 Demand for the intense but fleeting high was insatiable, the customer base 
captive. A huge labor pool, already alienated from the mainstream work force, 
jumped at the promise of an instant payday. Getting a piece of the action 
required no job application, no educational background and no special training 
-- other than street savvy, one of the few skills already in plentiful supply. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like, 'I don't need no education, I don't got to kiss nobody's ass, 
I'm the boss, this is my enterprise -- and I'm only 16,' " said ex-gangster T. 
Rodgers, a founding father of the Bloods, who ruled over a now-defunct crack 
empire during the 1980s. "Any kid old enough to hold a rock could become king 
for a day." 
</P>
<P>
 South-Central street gangs, viewed by the cocaine smugglers as tough but 
expendable foot soldiers, provided a ready-made distribution network for the 
marketing of this new discount commodity. 
</P>
<P>
 In a so-called "Dun and Bradstreet Primer" issued in 1989 by the U.S. attorney 
general, the Bloods and Crips were described as the nation's most powerful 
crack-trafficking ring, urban terrorists who had achieved dominance in at least 
47 cities, "due in part to their steady recourse to murderous violence." 
</P>
<P>
 The most sophisticated gang factions, along with their prison-based 
leadership, do control a large share of the wholesale trade, sometimes buying 
directly from Colombian suppliers. They also have embarked on an unprecedented 
cross-country migration, lured by profits many times higher than on Los 
Angeles' saturated streets. But most authorities ultimately have come to see 
the gangs less as huge conglomerates than as independent contractors -- bandit 
franchisees duking it out in a cutthroat market. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Mafias of past generations, which were able to parlay their ill-gotten 
gains into legitimate enterprises, most street gangs haven't demonstrated that 
kind of cohesiveness or business acumen. Even if tainted, such ventures might 
at least have created a few more avenues to mainstream success in the city's 
most desolate neighborhoods. Instead, like a giant plantation economy, crack 
has only intensified the financial vacuum, siphoning up the spare change of 
people who have nothing left to spare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crack may have allowed some people to kind of take care of business and 
support their families, but it's essentially a redistributive, zero-sum economy 
that squeezes the last cents out of the poorest communities in America," said 
Los Angeles historian Mike Davis, who has written extensively about the trade. 
"Despite all the gangsta rap images of these new robber-baron coke-dealers . . 
. I think black Americans will emerge from this pretty much as they always 
have: the victims." 
</P>
<P>
 Norman Tillman was bigger than most street-level dealers ever dream of 
becoming, a true high-rolling, fast-living, crack impresario. "But it's an 
illusion -- a delusion," said Tillman, 35, who figures he was worth about 
$700,000 before his coast-to-coast drug ring collapsed in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of Dorsey High in Southwest Los Angeles, Tillman spent his teen-age 
years toiling in a string of low-paying jobs, from pumping gas to marinating 
fast-food chicken to stripping paint. Later, he served in the Marine Corps and 
won a tennis scholarship to The Citadel in South Carolina, but broke his ankle 
and ended up living on a $250-a-month unemployment check. 
</P>
<P>
 When childhood friends sent him a first-class plane ticket back to California 
in 1983, they enlisted Tillman in one of the most prolific crack-dealing crews 
ever to rise up from Los Angeles' streets. In the span of a few years, he moved 
from selling crack on the curbside to supervising a network of rock houses to 
netting about $50,000 a week distributing kilos to other dealers across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had all the trappings of legitimacy," said Tillman, an imposing, 
statuesque man with a shaved head and silver hoop earring. "I felt as 
successful as any other successful businessman . . . on the same par as a Ph.D. 
graduate with money-management skills." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tillman's success was as ephemeral as a $20 rock. In rapid succession, his 
cohorts got busted -- in Chicago, in Boston, in Indianapolis -- costing him 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost product, bail bonds and legal fees. 
After his supplier was indicted, Tillman lost even more buying bogus dope from 
unreliable connections. He invested $80,000 in a children's photography studio 
that he called Tiny Tots, but his employees walked off with the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 At home, meanwhile, Tillman's poison also was taking its toll. A brother, now 
in rehab, got hooked on crack. So did a sister, who was forced to surrender a 
child to foster care. Another brother was gunned down in a drive-by. And their 
father, a disabled steelworker, died of a stroke -- just as he filled his lungs 
with a long drag of cocaine smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had lost control of the animal," Tillman said. "The animal had turned into 
a beast." 
</P>
<P>
 Broke and repentant, Tillman recently tried his hand at the condom business, 
peddling a new skin-toned brand on the very South-Central streets where he once 
dealt crack. But with a profit-margin of just 8 cents per prophylactic, he gave 
it up in November and headed back to his native Chicago, where he hopes to land 
a job in a housing authority drug recovery program. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he was handling all that cash, I tried to tell him, 'You can't keep this 
up,"' said Tillman's 72-year-old mother, Bernice, a retired cafeteria worker. 
"But he didn't listen. All those millions -- and the powers-that-be got it all 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Few dealers, in fact, ever make it out of the bottom rungs of the business, 
which has spawned almost unlimited entry-level opportunities but little real 
hope for long-term advancement. In pure financial terms, they barely rank above 
the Huallaga Valley's campesinos , poor Andean farmers who make up for their 
own lack of economic mobility by harvesting the coca leaves in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 The big bucks always have gone to those who control the cocaine pipeline 
between South America and the United States: cartels in Colombia, smugglers in 
Mexico, corrupt politicians and bribe-taking police from Latin America to 
California. Ex-Medellin kingpin Pablo Escobar probably lost more to mildew -- 
$400 million of his cash reportedly once rotted in a Los Angeles stash house -- 
than the Bloods or Crips ever made in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever a dope dealer does make it big -- or a basketball player or a rapper 
-- their success becomes entwined in the folklore of the streets, inspiring 
others to follow that route. This is a country, after all, that not only prizes 
the entrepreneurial spirit, but heaps scorn on those who fail to pull 
themselves up by their own bootstraps. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the odds are slim, most young hustlers have nothing but a dismal 
future to lose. For all its horrific costs, crack has at least served as an 
antidote to defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got one homeboy, I guess he don't like money or he's just stupid, because 
he goes around with his pocket empty all the time," said Ozzy, 21, who can make 
more money in one night selling crack than most families in his Eastside 
housing project ever see in a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many dealers, he's got little to show for it, other than tales of 
cruising in limos, renting motel rooms for nights on end and buying an '83 
Cadillac, which his friends promptly smashed up, unlicensed and uninsured. But 
Ozzy, who hasn't asked his parents for a dime since dropping out of the eighth 
grade, takes pride in knowing that he's got the cash to burn. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as I got money in my pocket," he said, after handing a friend a few 
bucks to fetch him a cheeseburger, "I must be doing something right."

</P>
<P>
 In this four-part series, The Times examines how Los Angeles County's 
neighborhoods, institutions and morals have been ravaged by a decade of crack, 
the most addictive form of cocaine ever devised.  
</P>
<P>
 * Sunday: Crack drains funds from vital public agencies, imposing a hidden tax 
on everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 * Monday: Crack creates a new wave of homelessness, bringing more crime and 
despair to the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 * Today: Crack forges an underground economy, luring a generation with false 
promises. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wednesday: Crack takes down a neighborhood -- but the spirit of its 
residents brings it back.

 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) The Economics of Crack 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last decade, crack has spawned an underground economy in Los Angeles 
that employs thousands of traffickers, many of whom view the illicit trade as 
their only financial option. Before it arrives on the streets, the drug passes 
through many hands, each time increasing in value. 
</P>
<P>
 1) Harvesting: Hundreds of thousands of poor South American farmers earn their 
livelihood growing coca leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Price: In Bolivia, one carga of leaves, or about 100 pounds, fetches between 
$38 and $51. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Refining: In makeshift labs throughout the Andean countries, the leaves are 
soaked in kerosene and acid, turning them into cocaine sulfate, also known as 
coca paste. The paste is further treated with chemical solvents, resulting in 
powdered cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Price: Before it leaves South America, a kilogram of powder, or 2.2 pounds, is 
worth between $950 and $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Shipping: As a result of crackdowns off the Florida coast, most shipments 
have been redirected to California via overland routes. Mexican smuggling rings 
now handle an estimated 70% of the cocaine bound here. 
</P>
<P>
 Price: For their trouble, they charge their Los Angeles connections between 
$12,000 and $14,000 per kilo. 
</P>
<P>
 4) Wholesaling: Southland street gangs and their prison-based leadership 
control most wholesale distribution of the drug, which they cook into crack by 
adding baking soda and water. 
</P>
<P>
 Price: When resold, often in one-ounce packets, each kilo can bring in between 
$25,000 and $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailing: The retail trade is a laissez-faire market, open to just about 
anybody willing to stand on a street corner with a plastic bag of crack. 
</P>
<P>
 Price: The standard curbside price is $20 per rock, a small nugget that 
averages about 0.2 of a gram. A kilo broken into these individual rocks will 
generate at least $100,000, and as much as $200,000 if cut with adulterants 
such as lidocaine and procaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Using: Crack's potent but short-lived punch commands addicts to return again 
and again as often as money will allow. 
</P>
<P>
 Price: The average crack user, according to one study, smokes about seven or 
eight rocks a day -- a habit that runs about $1,050 a week.

COLUMN ONE; SEGREGATION BY ANOTHER NAME?; THE WHITE SCHOOLS CHIEF STIRRED A

LONELY FIGHT ALSO REFLECTS NATIONAL DEBATE OVER ACADEMIC TRACKING.

<P>
 Corkin Cherubini was born in Virginia and has lived in rural Georgia for 24 
years. But in the eyes of some of his neighbors he's a Yankee. He does not fit 
in, they say; he does not understand the South. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarks like these can rankle, but in times of reflection -- and Cherubini is 
nothing if not a reflective man -- the 50-year-old educator has had to admit 
that, in some ways, they may be right. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has tried to fit in for most of his time in Calhoun County, since 
becoming schools superintendent two years ago he has proven himself hopelessly 
out of step, especially on the issue of race. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherubini first got into trouble when he tried to desegregate kindergarten. 
His efforts, coming almost 40 years after the Supreme Court outlawed racial 
segregation in public schools, drew the county into a maelstrom over an issue 
that many Americans thought was settled. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cherubini's battle, which has brought federal investigators to the tiny 
two-school district and sparked months of discord, including threats of 
violence, underscore an issue that many educators, government officials and 
integration experts say is a national problem -- the persistence of racial 
school segregation under the guise of academic grouping. 
</P>
<P>
 "The overrepresentation of minority children in special education and the 
underrepresentation in gifted programs, and tracking or grouping practices in 
general, is a major problem for African American schoolchildren in many, many 
school districts," said Norman Chachkin who specializes in school desegregation 
cases for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Academic tracking attempts to group students according to educational ability, 
with the aim of helping students get the teaching they need: not so advanced as 
to be discouraging, not so basic that it is boring. But critics charge that it 
can damage students, especially in early grades, by creating a lower set of 
expectations for those in lower groupings. 
</P>
<P>
 In Calhoun County, the schools officially were integrated 25 years ago. But in 
reality, the old system of one-race schools merely gave way to a new form of 
segregation, one that Cherubini, who is white, considers even more pernicious. 
</P>
<P>
 Blacks and whites attend the same schools but they are routed along separate 
tracks as early as kindergarten, with African Americans often pushed into 
vocational and special-education classes. 
</P>
<P>
 As a controversy over interracial prom dating this year in Wedowee, Ala., 
showed, the segregation often extends beyond the classroom. It is not uncommon 
in the South, for example, for whites and blacks to attend separate proms, eat 
lunch at separate tables and participate in separate school-sponsored 
extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Such social separation was easy to spot in Calhoun County. But what Cherubini 
discovered about segregation inside the classroom "blew my mind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With all of the debate raging over intelligence, race and genetics, he said, 
it was clear that black students in his own school district were not being 
given a chance. To him, this was not only immoral, but illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 When he found that, even as superintendent, he was powerless to change things, 
he called in the federal government. That's when the situation really got out 
of control. 
</P>
<P>
 Many locals were outraged. He received threatening phone calls. Parents pulled 
their children out of school. Rude letters appeared in the local newspaper, 
suggesting that he get out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was upset not necessarily with what he did but his way of doing it," 
complained school board President C.E. Cowart, who is white. Calling in the 
feds, he said, was over the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Calhoun County (population 5,013) sits in a depressed agricultural region in 
the southwest corner of Georgia. Although the county is 60% black, the economic 
and political leadership remains staunchly white. It is isolated territory. 
Cherubini began to fear for his family's safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like the walls are caving in on me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cherubini first took a teaching job here in 1970, after having worked in other 
parts of the country. He was taken aback to see that not only did black and 
white students sit at different tables in the cafeteria, but so did black and 
white teachers. Every year, the district holds an official prom, attended 
almost exclusively by African American students, while the whites go to an 
off-campus "social" sponsored by their parents and usually held at a country 
club. 
</P>
<P>
 The social is "a private party and we have zero to do with it," said Cowart, 
deflecting questions about whether blacks would be welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have nothing to do with who's invited." 
</P>
<P>
 While Cherubini found the social separation troubling, what disturbed him more 
was the segregation he saw inside the classroom. He taught 11th- and 12th-grade 
English. Every year, he would get classes full of African American students who 
had been designated early as low achievers and placed on a track toward 
vocational education. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of them seemed much more innately intelligent than their skills 
indicated, but by the time they reached Cherubini, they were so lacking in 
basic skills that he knew they would never catch up. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they've gone through six or seven grades in the low-expectation group, 
they fulfill the prophecy by junior high school," said Cherubini, a lanky, 
gray-haired man who looks a bit like former President Jimmy Carter and has the 
halting, earnest speaking style of actor Jimmy Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherubini did not make race an issue in his campaign for superintendent. But 
when he took office, he said, he discovered how "brutal" tracking really is and 
how resistant to change the in-school system of segregation had become. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenders of the system say tracking is an important educational tool that 
groups by ability, not race. But in Cherubini's eyes -- and in the eyes of some 
African American community leaders upset over the practice -- it was a caste 
system that relegated three-fourths of the district's black students to the 
lowest levels, perpetuating a race-based social-class structure. 
</P>
<P>
 In Calhoun County schools, African Americans make up 68% of the student body, 
93% of students labeled "mildly intellectually disabled" and 73% of 
special-education students. In Georgia as a whole, they are 36% of the 
students, 64% of mildly intellectually disabled students and 38% of 
special-education students. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Nancy Peck, associate director for the Southeastern Desegregation 
Assistance Center in Miami, said Calhoun County is "probably typical of some 
schools in my region (eight Southeastern states). And, if this is typical, we'd 
really better take notice." 
</P>
<P>
 Tracking is not unique to the South. Educational experts point to a number of 
court cases across the country, including California, in which schools have 
been ordered or have agreed to dismantle their tracking systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "In California, you see the same situation with Latino children, although it 
is complicated because one of the dilemmas that the schools face is how to 
provide appropriate bilingual support for children without relegating them to a 
low status of ability-grouped classrooms," said Dr. Jeannie Oakes, a professor 
of education at UCLA and author of a book on academic tracking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tracking is one of these problems where there's a lot of research that says 
it has negative consequences and no significant gains, especially at the 
elementary level," said Gary Orfield, a Harvard education professor. "But a 
great majority of parents, especially of kids who are in the higher tracks, 
totally disagree with that research. You run into a political nightmare on this 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When investigators from the U.S. Education Department's office of civil rights 
visited Calhoun County, they did not come in like gangbusters threatening to 
withhold federal funds. They paid two visits to the county in November, 
offering "technical assistance." 
</P>
<P>
 But, despite the low-key approach, a faction of the school board and a portion 
of the county's white population hit the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 A group called Concerned Calhoun County Citizens for Education launched an 
effort to recall Cherubini, whose four-year term expires in 1996. Richard West, 
one of the organizers, wrote a letter to the local newspaper addressed to 
Cherubini: "Most Yankees don't understand life in the South," it said. "If you 
haven't learned to like it in 25 years, Delta (Air Lines) is ready when you 
are." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in early November, around the time the federal investigators arrived, 
somebody distributed a leaflet calling for "No white teachers! No white 
workers! No white students!" and urging black locals to "Support Dr. C." 
</P>
<P>
 "We must arm ourselves and be ready to fight . . . " the leaflet said. "The 
war of the rases (sic) has started!" 
</P>
<P>
 It was followed by an anonymous call to a local business in which someone 
announced, falsely, that violence had already begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Worried parents flocked to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors spread in the white community that the flyers were distributed by James 
Gibson, a city councilman in Edison, Ga., and a vice president of the local 
NAACP. Two days before he had been seen distributing leaflets urging a boycott 
of white-owned businesses that he felt had been unfair to blacks. The hate 
flyer also urged a boycott. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson laughed at the charge. He and Cherubini said they suspect the flyer was 
written by a white person in an attempt to smear Gibson and damage Cherubini. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some teachers got pretty shook up, but it didn't affect the students," said 
Larry Wilkerson, the principal of the combined high and middle school. 
</P>
<P>
 On his visits to the school, though, Cherubini said he could discern a 
difference in atmosphere. Some white students glare at him when he passes. The 
tension in the community he and his wife experience among adults, he said, has 
reached the children. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelcey Lovett, 18, a black senior and a school quarterback, said he supports 
Cherubini, adding: "It's mainly the parents who have the problems with the 
blacks and whites in the classrooms." 
</P>
<P>
 But Preston Rish, 17, a white senior who also plays football, said: "In 
theory, I think this system of teaching everybody on an equal basis sounds real 
good, but I just don't know if it will work in real life. Maybe it will. I just 
wish that Dr. Cherubini would have handled it in a better way . . . Everybody 
is being forced to take a side." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1993, immediately after he assumed office, Cherubini began talking 
to principals of the district's two schools. He wanted to know how the new 
segregation had developed. One thing that concerned him was the two 
cheerleading squads, one all black for basketball and the other virtually all 
white for football. Because of financial support from the white community, the 
white squad received 29 times the funding of the black squad, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Cherubini began trying to change things, he said he ran up against 
resistance and obfuscation. 
</P>
<P>
 He asked the principal and the guidance counselor of the elementary school why 
some classes contained only black students. 
</P>
<P>
 According to district records, two of the four kindergarten classes, two of 
the four first-grade classes and two of the four second-grade classes were all 
black at the start of the 1993 school year. The other classes in each grade 
were nearly equally split between black and white students. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherubini was assured the groupings were not capricious. Tests determined 
academic capabilities, he was told. When he pressed school officials to show 
him the scores, Cherubini said, he was told they were not available. "I just 
came to the conclusion in my mind that there wasn't anything substantial or 
concrete to show why we were grouping in this way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbra Shannon, chief attorney in the Atlanta office of the federal Education 
Department, who visited the district twice in November, said she found it 
unclear how the groupings were devised. "I was told both things -- that they 
were placed there on the basis of their perceived or actual demonstrated 
abilities and I was also told it was just a random selection," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elementary School Principal Andy Sanders did not return a reporter's phone 
call. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherubini said his concern is that the black students grouped together in 
kindergarten remain together as they travel from grade to grade. Invariably, he 
said, the classes earn "C" or "D" designations on school enrollment forms, 
indicating that they consist of low-achieving students headed for vocational 
school. The racially mixed groups get "A" or "B" designations, which mean that 
they are college-bound. 
</P>
<P>
 However the groupings are determined, Cherubini said, students designated 
early as low achievers and lumped into the less-academically oriented classes 
stand little chance of breaking out. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowart, a banker who has sat on the school board for 22 years, acknowledges 
that, test scores aside, white students are routinely grouped together to keep 
them from feeling isolated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the whites, most of the time, ended up in the top (academic) 
ranking," he said. "But when you had whites who didn't fit the upper grouping, 
they were put in those classes anyway so they wouldn't be in a class that was 
mostly black, and when I say mostly black, I mean 95% black." 
</P>
<P>
 The intent was not to harm or segregate black students, he insisted. Officials 
"didn't want to leave (white students) feeling like they're without their 
friends," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherubini called this a myth and charged that the rationale was not so benign. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon said the district, at the Education Department's suggestion, has 
formed a task force to devise a plan for eliminating racially identifiable 
classes and integrating the cheerleading squads for the next school year. 
Rachel Taylor, a teacher who chaired the task force, said there once was one 
integrated squad for both teams. The task force is recommending reverting to 
that system, and, officials said, two white girls recently tried out to be 
basketball cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt after my last visit there, that they were going to address these 
issues and resolve them appropriately," Shannon said. But the school board will 
have to implement the task force's recommendations, and it remains unclear how 
far it is willing to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowart opposes changing the cheerleading squads. A motion to merge the squads 
died this year for lack of a second. He said blacks and whites join different 
squads only because blacks tend to be big basketball fans and whites prefer 
football. 
</P>
<P>
 While Cowart appeared willing to change the way students are grouped into 
classes, he said the board must move cautiously or else more whites will flee 
the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Some left at the start of the school year when Cherubini, working with the 
elementary school principal, added a fifth kindergarten class and tried to 
reassign white pupils so that there no longer were all-black classes. 
</P>
<P>
 After white parents starting pulling out their children, one class was left 
with only one white pupil and another with two. To ease their sense of 
isolation, Cherubini allowed the white students to be grouped together. 
</P>
<P>
 After the tinkering, the district now has one all-black kindergarten class and 
four that are mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got animosity in the county already, and we still haven't made that much 
progress," he said.

L.A. LEFT OUT OF URBAN AID PROGRAM, U.S. OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Los Angeles will not be included in a lucrative new federal program it has 
been counting on to help rebuild neighborhoods scarred in the 1992 riots but 
instead will receive a less generous package of loans and grants, senior 
Clinton Administration officials said Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles was passed over Monday when the Administration's Community 
Enterprise Board, chaired by Vice President Al Gore, met to designate six urban 
and three rural "empowerment zones" that will each receive a package of tax 
breaks and direct federal grants worth as much as $375 million over the next 
five years, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several federal officials criticized Los Angeles' application for the program 
as too vague about how the city would spend the federal aid. Local officials 
were warned at least twice that their application was short on details of how 
they would use the money and how nonprofit and private-sector groups would 
participate in the empowerment program. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials indicated Monday that the city and county are likely to 
receive between $200 million and $250 million in loan guarantees and grants 
from a smaller pool of money that the Administration has established as a 
consolation prize for the last cities weeded out. Another large city denied 
designation as an empowerment zone is to receive a similar package, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an effort to make the seventh and eighth cities feel as if they are 
super (empowerment) zone winners," said one high-ranking Administration 
official. "Whether they will feel that way, I can't say." 
</P>
<P>
 One senior Los Angeles official said Monday night that the city had not been 
formally notified that its application was rejected. "We're positive that we're 
still fighting and it is still in play," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is expected to announce the empowerment zone winners 
Wednesday, and their identities were not available Monday. It will also 
designate dozens of "empowerment communities" that will receive much smaller 
packages of federal aid. One official said California would receive seven such 
designations, the most of any state. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles officials have told the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development that they would use the consolation funds for capital in a 
multibillion-dollar community development bank that could fund housing and 
commercial projects in depressed L.A. neighborhoods. Eventually, the bank, 
modeled on the South Shore Development Bank in Chicago, could fund social 
services, the city contends in its application. 
</P>
<P>
 But city and state officials made clear that they consider that alternative 
distinctly second-best -- especially since the 1992 Los Angeles riots provided 
the initial impetus for legislation that created the empowerment zone program. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. would get some other grant funds and loans and that's very nice, but it 
doesn't compare to the empowerment zone designation," said Sen. Barbara Boxer 
(D-Calif.). "It's nice to be a bridesmaid: You get a pretty dress, a lot of 
attention, you hope you get a nice groom, but we should be the bride." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the loans and grants, Administration officials said Los Angeles 
would be given the same "priority status" as the six cities with designated 
empowerment zones for distribution of other federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
 And they noted that under the alternative program Los Angeles could receive 
more in direct federal grants than the $100 million that will be provided to 
each empowerment zone -- although the city would not be eligible for the tax 
breaks intended to attract private employers to depressed inner-city 
neighborhoods. City officials estimated that those tax breaks could be worth 
about $277 million over the five-year life of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Those alternative funds appeared unlikely to satisfy California officials who 
had fiercely lobbied for Los Angeles' designation in the coveted program. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the Administration's priority on fortifying its political position in 
California -- which with 54 electoral votes is the single largest prize in the 
1996 presidential campaign -- most observers have long thought that Los Angeles 
was virtually guaranteed selection as one of the empowerment zones. One White 
House official said Monday night that the prospect of denying a zone to Los 
Angeles had generated strong disagreement within the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 But Administration officials said that a combination of weakness in the city's 
application and constraints in the law itself had clouded Los Angeles' 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that Los Angeles was not an easy winner showed the process was not 
(politically) rigged," one White House official said Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 legislation established several strict criteria for the designation 
of the empowerment zones that have narrowed the Administration's flexibility. 
Although the bill provides funds to create empowerment zones in six cities, the 
statute specifies that one must have a population of less than 500,000 and 
another must straddle the borders of two states. Los Angeles is eligible for 
neither of those slots, leaving only four available. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Administration officials argued, the bill makes it virtually 
impossible for the Administration to award zones to each of the nation's three 
largest cities -- New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. To ensure that resources 
are carefully targeted, the law mandates that the six urban empowerment zones 
have a cumulative population of 750,000 or less. 
</P>
<P>
 New York, Los Angeles and Chicago each proposed establishing zones in 
neighborhoods with populations of about 200,000. If all three cities were 
designated, other communities would have to scale back their proposed zones to 
remain under the legislation's population cap, one Administration official 
said. As a result, the Administration has made clear that "there are 
effectively two slots" for the three largest cities, a Los Angeles official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In that competition, an Administration official said, Los Angeles' 
"application was not as strong as it might be." The official described the Los 
Angeles application as "weak in two key areas:" the level of commitment from 
the private sector to invest in the empowerment zone, and details on how the 
city would spend the federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles officials got their first inkling of that only weeks before the 
June 30 deadline to apply. HUD officials reviewed a draft of Los Angeles' 
application and told city staffers that it was lacking in detail and not 
competitive. The North Hollywood-based consulting firm of Hamilton, Rabinowitz 
& Alschuler Inc. -- hired to prepare the application at a cost of up to 
$300,000 -- was sent scrambling to rewrite it. 
</P>
<P>
 After making last-minute adjustments to address the HUD concerns, city and 
county officials submitted their joint application for an empowerment zone that 
would have included neighborhoods in Pacoima, South-Central and Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week, HUD again told city officials that the application was not 
specific enough. Two days later, HUD representative Wendy Guel met with Mayor 
Richard Riordan and City Council members to outline alternative grants if the 
application failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials contend that they purposely left the application vague so that 
they could hold public hearings to get community input on how to spend the 
money once it was approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a decision early on not to be specific," said Corde Carrillo, 
director of economic development for the county's Community Development 
Commission. "We felt this should be a grass-roots-generated application and so 
the city emphasized the kinds of programs that would be involved and the 
grass-roots infrastructure that would be set in place. I suppose we can be 
second-guessed, but it was very much in the spirit of the application materials 
and the fact that this was supposed to be a community-generated project." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real loss to the city," said Linda Griego, president and chief 
executive officer of RLA, a riot recovery agency that was called in recently to 
help buttress the application with information from the private sector. Griego 
said she has heard that applications submitted by other cities included 
specific private-sector collaborations aimed at further invigorating the 
neighborhoods targeted for federal funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard one application had a major medical school that committed to 
providing free prenatal care to anyone who lived in the zone," she said. 
Another, she said, named a college that already had ongoing training programs 
with nearby businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand some cities did a pretty incredible job," she said. "We might 
have missed the mark." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Administration meeting Monday, city officials and Boxer also blamed 
California Gov. Pete Wilson for not providing more support. City officials 
lobbying the Clinton Administration have argued that Los Angeles should not be 
penalized for the failure of the fiscally strapped state government to commit 
matching funds or bonds to leverage the federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior Administration official said Monday night that there was discussion 
of seeking legislation that would formally designate Los Angeles and the other 
missed finalist as empowerment zones -- and thus make them eligible to provide 
tax incentives for business. But the official acknowledged that any effort to 
expand the program would face an extremely uncertain prospect in the 
Republican-controlled Congress.

CLINTON TARGETS FIVE AGENCIES TO OFFSET TAX PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton and top Administration officials on Monday staged an 
elaborate briefing to explain the reductions in government programs that they 
will seek to compensate for revenue lost because of Clinton's proposed 
middle-class tax cut, but they left many questions unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that $20 billion of the $60-billion cost of the tax relief will 
come from the budgets of five government agencies -- Transportation, Energy, 
Housing and Urban Development, the Office of Personnel Management and the 
General Services Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the heads of all the agencies promised "downsizing" and 
"streamlining," many of the specific cuts needed to achieve the $20 billion in 
savings have not yet been decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Also unanswered was how much of the $20 billion will come from onetime savings 
from selling off public assets, such as the Elk Hills naval oil reserve in 
California, and how much will come from permanent reductions in ongoing 
government operations. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, $4 billion in savings from "other" government actions were 
promised on Monday but were not spelled out. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanked by Vice President Al Gore; Alice Rivlin, director of the White House 
Office of Management and Budget, and the five agency chiefs, Clinton said that 
the initial $20 billion in savings will grow from an expansion of his 
"reinventing government" initiative to make government smaller and more 
responsive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to change yesterday's government and make it work for the America of 
today and tomorrow," Clinton said at a briefing for reporters. "We propose to 
stop doing things that government doesn't do very well and that don't need to 
be done by government, and we believe we should increase our efforts where 
government can make a real, positive difference in the lives of ordinary 
Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 The revisions include a radical redesign of HUD's public housing programs for 
the urban poor, a shift of 40,000 federal air traffic control workers into a 
semiprivate corporation, sale of surplus uranium to industry, consolidation of 
grants for transportation projects and the transfer of administrative and 
personnel tasks performed by the General Services Administration and the Office 
of Personnel Management to Cabinet agencies or the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 According to figures supplied by the White House on Monday, the revisions will 
save $10.6 billion at the Energy Department over the next five years, $6.7 
billion at Transportation, $800 million at Housing and Urban Development, $1.4 
billion at General Services and $30 million at Personnel Management. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all the proposals require approval by the Republican-dominated 
Congress, hardly a sure bet in an atmosphere of partisan hostility and zeal to 
cut government to pay for tax rebates to the public. Republicans already have 
pledged deeper cuts than the Clinton plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore described the philosophy guiding the Administration's plans in this way: 
"We will stop making so many decisions in Washington that would be better made 
by state government, local government or individual citizens and we will 
replace Washington interference with local opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the savings in Transportation and Housing will come from just such 
efforts: stripping away government mandates and sending money to states and 
cities with far fewer strings attached. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will increase total transportation investment by cutting red tape and 
forming dynamic partnerships with cities and states and with the private 
sector," said Transportation Secretary Federico Pena. "What we are about is 
building bridges, not bureaucracy; picking priorities, not pork; moving people, 
not paper, and, above all, ensuring traveler safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Energy Department officials were hard-pressed to identify specific cuts that 
would be made, saying that nothing has been formally decided and that Congress 
would be consulted before certain programs are reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Energy Secretary Bill White pledged that the $10.6 billion would be 
met and said that even greater reductions over five years are possible. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that 80% of the reductions would represent cuts in departmental 
operations and its work force as opposed to simply selling off assets and 
surplus stocks of highly enriched uranium. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that savings of $1.2 billion would be realized in the area of applied 
research, but did not indicate that any of the department's research labs like 
the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory near Berkeley would be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to make our national laboratories more competitive with what you 
see in the private sector," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that turning Elk Hills and related petroleum reserves over to 
private hands would yield $1.6 billion over the next five years. However, White 
said he is unsure whether these holdings would be sold outright or leased, 
explaining that this is a matter on which Congress would be consulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, savings in waste management and environmental programs would amount 
to $4.4 billion, including changes to make the nuclear waste cleanup program 
more efficient, according to White and others. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, reductions in staffing, operating expenses and overhead for the 
strategic petroleum reserve program, as well as sales of uranium, would achieve 
more than $3.4 billion, officials told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of the numbers sound large, when spread across the scale of the 
$1.5 trillion a year federal budget and a period of five years, the actual 
scope of the reductions is small. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Department of Transportation, for example, Clinton's plan would trim 
spending on infrastructure projects -- roads, bridges, airports and railways -- 
by slightly more than 3% over the next five years, about $1 billion from the 
department's roughly $25-billion annual infrastructure budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts would reduce spending on projects across the country but department 
officials said that they did not have details on which projects would be 
reduced and probably will not have such figures until some time next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena also plans a major reorganization of the department, consolidating 
several of its agencies and combining about 30 existing grant programs into 
three new programs. The result of that is supposed to be a more streamlined, 
and less expensive, department. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Transportation has eliminated about 4,000 positions as part of the 
Administration's reinventing government efforts. The department now will try to 
eliminate several thousand more jobs as part of the reorganization. Officials 
estimated that the savings will be about $300 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the Administration plans to resubmit a proposal that Congress has 
shot down in the past to put the Federal Aviation Administration's air traffic 
control system in private hands. Rather than a federal bureaucracy, the air 
traffic control system would become a federally chartered corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 That plan would not directly save the government money. Some 40,000 workers -- 
air traffic controllers, supervisors and other personnel -- would move off the 
government payroll but the new corporation would also inherit most of the 
revenue from the existing airline ticket tax. The government should realize 
some savings, Transportation Department spokesman Richard Mintz said, but more 
important -- because a privately run system would be able to do more for the 
same amount of money -- "you would get better service" for the public and for 
the airlines.

OTHER COUNTIES SEEK TO DEFEND FUND STRATEGIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS and J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's plunge into financial chaos is reverberating around the state 
as county treasurers are being forced to defend their use of risky investment 
practices that once produced high returns but are now generating paper losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Some admit with chagrin that, like former Orange County Treasurer-Tax 
Collector Robert L. Citron, they made what proved to be a losing bet -- that 
interest rates would continue falling into 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of these county investment officers have tied up a large percentage 
of their funds in disappointing strategies that were intended to squeeze out 
extra returns for schools, cities and other local government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Many borrowed sizable sums -- issuing hundreds of millions of dollars in 
government-backed notes -- believing they could boost earnings for local 
agencies by reinvesting the money at a higher interest rate. This 
once-successful approach is now being abandoned as unprofitable -- and 
potentially dangerous if handled improperly. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the counties that employed some of the same investment practices that 
led to Orange County's downfall are San Diego, San Bernardino, Solano, Sonoma, 
Monterey and Placer. But the treasurers in each of these counties insist that 
they manage their investments more carefully than did Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 They point out that they did not invest in high-risk securities nearly to the 
extent that Citron did in Orange County. Most also point out that so far their 
losses on these investments are relatively minor and exist only on paper 
because no liquidations have been forced. Further, these investment funds all 
remain solvent, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews and in detailed memos to their county boards of supervisors, 
these elected officials are doing their best to to distance themselves from 
Citron and the investment tactics that sent Orange County to federal court 
seeking bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Many bristle when they are mentioned in news reports about Orange County's 
misfortunes and fret over the damage that can result if their local government 
investors lose confidence and suddenly withdraw large amounts of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless there is panic, these treasurers uniformly say, they will be able to 
restructure their investments and survive very well, with their rates of return 
reduced but the principal still intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Larsen, the assistant treasurer in San Bernardino County, was one of 
several financial officers who expressed bitterness at being mentioned in news 
reports as using some of the same strategies deployed by Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the phone had been ringing off the hook with people wanting to know if 
their investments are safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first question they ask is: 'Are you like Orange County?' " Larsen said. 
"It's been hectic, and we are trying to let them know that we are not like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 However, like Orange County, San Bernardino County has relied heavily on 
reverse repurchase agreements, which account for about a third of its $2.4 
billion in investments. Reverse repurchase agreements are deals in which owners 
of a security use it as collateral to borrow money and invest the money in 
another security, which often takes longer to mature. 
</P>
<P>
 In times of falling or stable interest rates, these investments are highly 
profitable, but they can go sour when interest rates rise. (As market interest 
rates rise, longer-term bonds decline more sharply in value than shorter-term 
ones because investors are less willing to take the chance of earning sub-par 
returns for extended periods.) But Larsen and others say that, if the 
investments are made wisely, the reverse repos are a good way to squeeze out 
additional income from their investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will modify our position downward because of all the scrutiny of them and 
the fact that people don't understand them," Larsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Orange County's Citron, San Bernardino investment officials have 
avoided exotic investments such as so-called inverse floaters, which are 
investment contracts that decline in value if interest rates rise. 
</P>
<P>
 And few of the county fund's investors have the option of pulling their money 
out on short notice. Larsen said that about $90 million of the portfolio could 
be withdrawn and that much of that was money from the city of Chino Hills. 
Larsen said the city has indicated it is willing to leave the money in the 
account. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest thing we need to do is inform people about what's going on," 
Larsen said. "Then the uncertainty goes away." On Monday, Standard & Poor's 
Rating Group announced that it had reviewed San Bernardino County's investments 
and found no reason to downgrade the county's credit rating. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the rating agency reached a similar conclusion about San Diego 
County's investment pool. Although the fund showed $357 million in paper losses 
from its $3.3-billion portfolio, county Treasurer Paul Boland had only a small 
amount of his assets tied up in a reverse repo. 
</P>
<P>
 However, San Diego County has invested 26% of its fund in a variety of 
derivatives, including inverse floaters. About 25% of the money held in the 
fund belongs to cities and special districts that can withdraw their shares 
whenever they like. 
</P>
<P>
 Boland is among several treasurers who are doing their best to reduce panic by 
their investors to prevent what would be the government investment equivalent 
of a run on a bank. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been trying to persuade these governmental units to stand by his fund 
so that he will not have to sell assets for a loss to satisfy unexpected cash 
demands. However, he has announced that he will sell as much as $400 million in 
holdings at a loss to meet all the fund's expected needs. 
</P>
<P>
 In Placer County, Treasurer Jenine Windeshausen said that her fund, with $370 
million in investments, now shows a paper loss of about 7% of its value. 
</P>
<P>
 But like many of the treasurers interviewed, she emphasized that losses on 
paper won't materialize if the investments are held until they mature. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have managed the portfolio for the last seven years and we have not had 
actual losses," Windeshausen said. "That reflects our long-held conservative 
investment philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
 However, her portfolio is now being reviewed by rating agencies because of its 
heavy reliance on derivatives, including some of the exotic kinds that 
contributed to Orange County's demise. Windeshausen said that most of the 
derivatives she has invested are holding their value. (Derivatives are 
investment contracts that "derive" their value from underlying securities.) 
</P>
<P>
 About 15% of the worth of her fund has been used in reverse repurchase 
agreements, but she plans to reduce that to zero by April. "We have decreased 
our use of that strategy as (interest) rates started to go up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monterey County Treasurer Lou Solton complained that since the Orange County 
collapse he repeatedly has had to explain why his reverse repurchase agreements 
-- about 40% of his $575-million investment pool -- are safer than Orange 
County's. "To be blunt, it's getting to the point of frustration," he said. "We 
somehow are ending up on the list." 
</P>
<P>
 And it isn't just reporters who are asking the questions. Last week, Solton 
issued a nine-page memo to the county's Board of Supervisors and others 
explaining his investment strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before discussing the characteristics of the investments, I want to clearly 
state for the record that Monterey County is not and will not become subject to 
any cash-flow crisis that would cause an 'Orange County' condition to arise," 
he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sonoma County, Assistant Tax Collector Thomas C. Ford complained that 
Orange County's fall had tarnished the reputation of all county investment 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford said the Sonoma County's $800-million portfolio had 6% in paper losses. 
Reverse repurchases represent about 20% of the fund, he said, arguing that they 
have not proved to be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 He compared his county's policy, which includes some modest risk-taking, with 
the play-it-safe strategy of many other county treasurers. "I laugh when I read 
columns that the public is being protected by naive treasurers (who take no 
risks,)" he said. "Most are not doing a very good job." 
</P>
<P>
 In Solano County, the $427-million investment fund has lost about 5% in paper 
value. The county has made extensive use of reverse repurchase agreements -- 
more than 40% of its portfolio, said Treasurer Bobby D. Stow. And 30% of the 
investment is in derivatives, including some that gambled on interest rates 
falling and others tied to a rise in rates. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years in a row, he has issued $26 million in notes so that he can turn 
around and invest it -- making money off of the difference between the interest 
rate the county pays and what it gets on its investments. But now, in a climate 
of rising rates, he says he must abandon that strategy, which earned more than 
$1 million over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the Orange County crisis, counties that have stuck by a 
more conservative strategy can now gloat about their more solid approach to 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside County Treasurer R. Wayne Watts said that he has purposely shunned 
exotic investments such as reverse repurchases and inverse floaters. 
</P>
<P>
 And giant Los Angeles County, with its $6.6-billion investment portfolio, has 
managed to resist the pressure to pump up returns in a period of financial 
tightening for local governments. Only 3% of the total is in reverse repos, 
said Joe Spillane, compliance auditor for the Los Angeles County Treasurer-Tax 
Collector.

COPTER CRASH COULD IMPERIL NUCLEAR PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN and TERESA WATANABE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials began to worry Monday that North Korea's 
puzzling reluctance to turn over the American pilots whose helicopter went down 
over its territory could, if it continues, jeopardize the entire nuclear 
agreement just negotiated with Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of anyone who thinks that the (nuclear) agreement can survive if 
they don't produce the pilots," one Administration official said. "Unless this 
issue is resolved, everything's off." 
</P>
<P>
 The American uneasiness about the impact of the helicopter incident was 
heightened Monday after North Korea rejected a U.S. request for high-level 
meetings of the U.N. Military Armistice Commission to arrange the return of the 
surviving Army pilot and the remains of a second pilot who died. 
</P>
<P>
 In talks at the truce village of Panmunjom, North Korea turned down at least 
three meeting times suggested by U.S. military officers, saying that they were 
"too busy" conducting their investigation into the incident, a U.S. spokesman 
said. In some past incidents, the Armistice Commission -- which is responsible 
for supervising the cease-fire that halted the Korean War and handling 
armistice violations -- has met to resolve problems like the helicopter 
incident relatively routinely and speedily. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual delay this time could just be temporary, U.S. officials cautioned. 
It may yet turn out that North Korea will return the two Americans within the 
next couple of days. If so, the incident probably will turn out to be a 
relatively minor one, reflecting only North Korea's inability to gather 
information and make decisions quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 But by late Monday, after Pyongyang's continued stonewalling of American 
inquiries, some U.S. officials were growing increasingly concerned that the 
delay could have broader implications. 
</P>
<P>
 They and South Korean analysts were beginning to wonder whether the North 
Korean army -- or perhaps some hard-line elements within it -- might be 
thinking of using the American pilots to try to sabotage the nuclear deal. 
Under the agreement reached in October, North Korea is supposed to freeze and 
eventually dismantle its existing nuclear installations in exchange for a 
series of economic and diplomatic rewards. 
</P>
<P>
 These analysts speculated that the North Korean leadership is divided into 
dovish and hawkish factions: a dovish one concentrated in the Foreign Ministry, 
which negotiated the nuclear agreement with the Clinton Administration in 
Geneva, and a hawkish one centered in the Korean People's Army. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (North Korean) military has nothing but contempt for the Foreign Ministry 
types," observed one American analyst. "They are in two completely different 
worlds." 
</P>
<P>
 And Kim Jong Il, North Korea's not-yet-official leader, may be unable to 
resolve or end the infighting. Kim, the son of North Korea's founding leader, 
Kim Il Sung, who died last July, has been informally named the country's new 
leader but has not yet been given the formal titles of head of the government 
and of the ruling Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the one hand, you'd think they'd want to get this (helicopter incident) 
over with as quickly as possible," observed one South Korean analyst Monday. 
"After all, they just signed this Geneva agreement to upgrade their relations 
with the United States. That's why it's difficult to understand why they are 
dragging their feet. The (North Korean) military may be trying to put the 
brakes on putting the agreement into reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Many other analysts believe that North Korea may try to use the pilots to 
extract some new concessions from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure there are people in Pyongyang arguing that 'We've got the 
(Americans) on the run. We got a very good deal in Geneva by being tough. Now 
let's make the Americans come across and give something. We can get more out of 
these guys, whether it's an abject apology or what,' " said former U.S. 
Ambassador to South Korea James R. Lilley, now a scholar at the American 
Enterprise Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 One possibility is that the Communist regime may be trying to bargain for 
separate peace talks with the United States rather than through the United 
Nations' commission at Panmunjom. Pyongyang began boycotting meetings of the 
U.S.-led commission after it appointed a South Korean general as chairman in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has rejected Pyongyang's calls for a separate agreement, 
however, because it would bypass South Korea. Any peace agreement must be 
negotiated between North and South, both Washington and Seoul have agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 At the State Department, spokesman Mike McCurry acknowledged that the Clinton 
Administration has told North Korea it "cannot understand" the reasons for the 
delay. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American people will in some sense form a judgment about North Korea 
based on how North Korea responds to our repeated requests for more information 
and more details about the incident," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The helicopter went down on Saturday morning in Korea (Friday night in the 
United States). Ever since then, the United States has been pressing for an 
immediate return of the captured pilot, Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall, and 
the remains of his co-pilot, Chief Warrant Officer David Hilemon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The North Koreans haven't had any reluctance in the past in meeting with us," 
a U.S. official said. "This (the Military Armistice Commission) is a well-used 
channel." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its requests, the Clinton Administration has also sent messages 
to the Pyongyang regime through North Korean diplomats at the United Nations in 
New York City. But Administration officials acknowledged that this diplomatic 
channel may be of limited utility, because the party most directly involved in 
holding the pilots is the Korean People's Army. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, a North Korean diplomat said that the repatriation will occur 
soon -- but he also urged the United States to conclude a peace treaty "as soon 
as possible" to prevent another tragedy from occurring, according to the South 
Korean newspaper Hankyoreh Shinmun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect in the current amicable atmosphere between (North Korea) and the 
United States, the surviving pilot and remains of the dead one will soon be 
repatriated," the unnamed diplomat was quoted as saying. "It is unfortunate a 
human life was sacrificed in this time of peace. This has much to do with the 
current cease-fire agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Mann reported from Washington, Watanabe from Seoul.

CHIAPAS REBELS DEPLOY FORCES IN SOUTHERN MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Armed Indian rebels and militant peasants seized town halls, barricaded 
highways and erected banners proclaiming liberated zones in the southern state 
of Chiapas on Monday, in what rebel leader Subcommander Marcos called their 
first major military action since his group suspended its bloody New Year's Day 
uprising 11 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no reports of armed clashes, and Marcos stressed that the Zapatista 
rebels are under orders to avoid armed confrontation with the estimated 40,000 
federal troops deployed in the state. The army also appeared to be maintaining 
a unilateral cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 As the barricades -- made with fallen trees -- and banners went up and at 
least one major city hall fell to the rebels early Monday morning, Marcos 
announced at a news conference at his jungle headquarters that "thousands" of 
his Zapatista National Liberation Army fighters had broken through an army 
cordon around their rain-forest stronghold. Along with peasant sympathizers, he 
said, they had peacefully occupied 38 towns and villages throughout the state 
to "fortify" them against future attacks by the Mexican army. 
</P>
<P>
 State and federal officials in Mexico City and the state capital, Tuxtla 
Gutierrez, sought to downplay the day's events in the embattled state, which 
included the armed seizure of the City Hall in Simojovel, about 30 miles from 
San Cristobal de las Casas. 
</P>
<P>
 Army officers indicated that they had no orders to respond militarily after 
the Zapatista rebels fanned out from their jungle positions near the Guatemalan 
border. And the state's newly installed administration characterized the 
banners and blockades as more of a peace offensive than a military operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a gigantic error to think that this is the beginning of a 
conflagration," the state's interior minister, Eraclia Zepeda, declared on 
national television. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, a government spokesman confirmed the rebel takeover in 
Simojovel, where 20 armed peasants seized the center of local government, but 
he added that the roadblocks on eight major highways in the state were the work 
of just 600 peasants, none of them armed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without doubt," the spokesman declared, "this is not (a replay of) Jan. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 But the pipe-smoking rebel leader, who uses only the nom de guerre 
Subcommander Marcos, asserted that his fighters are preparing for war. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing his trademark black ski mask, Marcos flatly rejected President Ernesto 
Zedillo's eleventh-hour proposal to create a peace committee, made up of 
opposition and ruling-party legislators, to talk rather than fight. Zedillo's 
proposed commission would be authorized to negotiate a permanent cease-fire 
with the Zapatistas and satisfy demands that include equal rights for the 
indigenous people in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 On balance, most analysts concluded that Monday's rebel troop movements 
sharpened the potential for more bloodshed just under a year after the 
Zapatistas launched a New Year's Day offensive by occupying Chiapas' major 
cities. The uprising provoked a shooting war with the Mexican army that left 
nearly 150 people dead in 12 days. 
</P>
<P>
 In asserting that his rebels were merely fortifying communities that 
sympathize with the Zapatistas, Marcos offered reporters no evidence of 
government troop movements, and there was no indication that the Mexican army 
plans to attack those towns in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 His claims came less than a week after Marcos publicly declared that an 
11-month truce with the government had ended. "War is imminent," he declared 
last week. And reports from the Chiapas countryside indicated that many of the 
militants who staged Monday's operations were, in fact, members of the 
Zapatista rebel army. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who erected banners proclaiming "Welcome to Zapatista territory" 
and "In this free, rebel territory, we prohibit the entrance of military 
personnel, security forces and police" were armed men dressed in the 
Zapatista's bandannas, ski masks and brown fatigues. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcos also called Zedillo's peace plan "insufficient," asserting that the 
Zapatistas decided to break the cease-fire after the Dec. 8 inauguration of 
ruling party Gov. Eduardo Robledo Rincon, which Zedillo attended with a bearhug 
and best wishes for the new governor in spite of opposition allegations that he 
won the office in August through fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Only through Robledo's resignation and the mediation of the sympathetic bishop 
of San Cristobal de las Casas, Samuel Ruiz, could the conflict be resolved 
peacefully, Marcos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to Monday's unrest, Bishop Ruiz began a hunger strike, because the 
day's events "showed our state and our country sliding down the slope to war 
and irreversible violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even the rebel leader indicated that the potential for violence may be 
somewhat less immediate than appeared on the surface Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The general command of the Zapatista army has ordered its troops to avoid as 
far as possible contact with troops of the federal army, and (the Zapatistas) 
pledge not to attack, for now, the (army's) current positions," Marcos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's operation was designed "with the aim of avoiding armed clashes," he 
said. "There were no clashes, in strict compliance with the cease-fire, which 
is being maintained with regard to these troops."

ITO ORDERS DNA HEARING, DISALLOWS JAIL REMARKS; SIMPSON TRIAL: ARGUMENT OVER 
USE OF SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE COULD DELAY OPENING STATEMENTS UNTIL FEBRUARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosecutors will not get to ask what O.J. Simpson told Rosey Grier during an 
emotional jailhouse outburst last month, but they have prevailed in their 
efforts to win a full-scale hearing on the admissibility of DNA evidence, 
Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito ruled Monday in a pair of decisions that will 
frame the pace and order of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The DNA order virtually assures that opening statements will not begin before 
early February -- some experts, in fact, predict that it could be months before 
that phase of the trial is under way. The other order means that prosecutors 
will be forced to try their case without the benefit of Simpson's impassioned 
exclamation to Grier, who is an ordained minister, on Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources have said that the short comment -- a sheriff's deputy who overheard 
it testified that it was three to five seconds long and consisted of two 
sentences -- was arguably incriminating but also vague and so stripped of 
context that its relevance would certainly have been challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, Ito ruled that Simpson waived the privilege that normally protects 
communications with clergy by raising his voice. But the judge nevertheless 
concluded that the remark should remain confidential, in part because Simpson 
had been led to believe that the area where he meets with his lawyers on 
weekends -- the same location where he and Grier met that Sunday afternoon -- 
was private. 
</P>
<P>
 "Counsel for Simpson now argue Simpson was lulled into a false sense of 
security in regard to the confidentiality of his communications in the . . . 
visiting area," Ito wrote in his ruling. "Under the highly unusual and 
apparently unique factual setting in this case, with regard to this single 
incident, the argument is well-taken." 
</P>
<P>
 The conversation between Simpson and Grier has been the object of legal 
tussling and public speculation for weeks, but has never played a significant 
role in the case itself. Even if Ito had allowed prosecutors to learn what the 
deputy allegedly overheard, it would not have cleared the way for the statement 
to be introduced at Simpson's trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the jailhouse remark has never been much more than a sideshow in the 
case, DNA test results are a mainstay of the prosecution case against Simpson, 
who has pleaded not guilty to murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and 
her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman on the night of June 12. 
</P>
<P>
 In his brief, three-paragraph order, Ito rejected a novel defense suggestion 
that jurors be allowed to sit in on the debate over admissibility of DNA test 
results, a proposal that had offered several strategic advantages to Simpson's 
camp but one that legal experts had widely predicted Ito would reject. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito did not spell out his reasons for rejecting the Simpson team's DNA motion. 
He did, however, direct the court clerk to notify the 24 jurors and alternate 
jurors who have been sworn in to hear the case that they no longer need to 
report for service on Jan. 4; instead, Ito ordered that they appear on Jan. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 That could be premature, however. Most experts predict that the DNA hearing 
will be an exhaustive one: Prosecutors have estimated that it will take four to 
eight weeks, while defense estimates have ranged from a few weeks to several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Coleman, the founder and president of a Seattle-based DNA laboratory, 
said he would expect the hearing to last at least three months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea that this is going to last five to eight weeks is a fantasy," 
Coleman said. "We're talking about three months minimum." 
</P>
<P>
 The complexity of the coming hearing is magnified by the fact that authorities 
in the Simpson case have made use of at least four different types of DNA tests 
in preparing their case -- and all the various tests are subject to defense 
challenge, potentially creating a series of overlapping challenges, each with 
important implications for the conduct of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The most established brand of DNA analysis, known as RFLP testing, has been 
performed on some samples, including blood drops found at the scene of the 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 RFLP tests have been admitted in evidence and accepted by California appellate 
courts, and few legal experts believe that Simpson's defense team will have any 
success in keeping those results from being presented to the jury. But at least 
three other types of DNA tests are being performed on samples taken from the 
crime scene, as well as Simpson's home and car. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities hope to show that blood from the car or from Simpson's property 
came from the victims. If so, it could force Simpson's team to explain how 
their client's possessions came to be stained with blood that shares genetic 
characteristics with a pair of stabbed and slashed murder victims. 
</P>
<P>
 But the various types of DNA tests have some drawbacks. So-called PCR 
analysis, which is being performed on a number of samples, is especially 
vulnerable to contamination, and Simpson's lawyers have argued from the start 
that authorities mishandled samples, making any findings inherently unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Contamination is the Achille's heel of the PCR test," Coleman said, while 
adding that he nevertheless believes that most of the DNA test results offered 
by the prosecution will be allowed into evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's orders bring a temporary end to the court action in the Simpson 
trial. The two sides are slated to return Jan. 4, and Ito has indicated that he 
would like to tackle the DNA issue first. 
</P>
<P>
 Once that debate is settled, the two sides will turn to the admissibility of 
information about the sometimes stormy relationship between O.J. and Nicole 
Simpson, who were divorced in 1992. Prosecutors hope to have jurors hear that 
evidence, but Simpson's attorneys have downplayed the significance of it and 
have argued that it is irrelevant to the murder charges that their client 
faces. The Simpson Case

ORANGE COUNTY D.A. SEIZES RECORDS IN INVESTMENT PROBE; CRISIS: OFFICES OF 
TREASURER AND AUDITOR ARE TARGETED. THE INVESTIGATION APPEARS TO FOCUS ON WHAT 
INVESTORS WERE TOLD ABOUT THE RISKS INVOLVED IN THE COUNTY FUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Armed with search warrants, investigators from the Orange County district 
attorney's office scoured the offices of the county's treasurer and auditor 
Monday, launching a criminal probe into the risky investment practices that 
plunged the county into an unprecedented bankruptcy crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Sealing off the hallway leading to former Treasurer Robert L. Citron's office 
with yellow crime-scene tape, about 30 investigators -- including some from the 
Securities and Exchange Commission and the State Department of Corporations -- 
combed through files, removing boxes of documents and computers and loading 
them into two vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nearby government building, authorities collected audits of the 
investment portfolio conducted by Auditor-Controller Steve E. Lewis. 
Investigators, he said, were particularly interested in a 1993 audit that 
criticized Citron's investment strategies and said state laws were being 
violated. 
</P>
<P>
 At the treasurer's office, investigators appeared to be focusing on documents 
that could shed light on Citron's investments and precisely what cities, 
schools and special districts with savings in the fund were told about the 
risks of those investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said they would be collecting documents from the treasurer's 
office throughout Monday night. While the probe continued, these developments 
took place Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 * County officials said Monday they were preparing to cut about 25% out of 
this year's budget because of the loss of interest revenue. The cuts, however, 
will not be shared equally among county departments. Public safety and welfare 
services are a higher priority, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 * At the urging of the county's management council -- composed of Dist. Atty. 
Michael R. Capizzi, Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, Sheriff Brad Gates and Health 
Services Agency Director Thomas Uram -- the Superior Court system offered to 
trim $1 million from its budget, largely by allowing 35 to 45 jobs to remain 
unfilled, according to Assistant Presiding Judge Ted Millard. Officials in 
other county departments declined to comment on possible cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salomon Bros., the brokerage handling the liquidation of the fund's 
portfolio, said the fund will receive $598 million in cash from the $1.39 
billion raised in last week's initial sale. The rest of the proceeds -- $792 
million -- were used to pay down some of the loans still outstanding to the 
fund from major brokerage houses. Meanwhile, Salomon on Monday sold an 
additional $175 million in securities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Investors in the county fund learned that property taxes collected earlier 
this month will be released Friday to all public agencies. "We're seeing step 
by step that we're going to see a resolution to this," said Blake Anderson, 
general manager of the Orange County Sanitation District, which will receive 
about $20 million in property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it had filed a motion 
that allows it to be a formal part of the bankruptcy proceedings and monitor 
the distribution of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Sacramento, a special Senate committee held its first meeting to look 
into the Orange County investment debacle and several lawmakers raised doubts 
that the state can offer much assistance. "I've got a feeling a lot of these 
local governments are going to come up here with their hands out and ask us to 
bail them out," said Sen. Dan Boatwright (D-Concord). "We don't have the money 
to bail them out. . . . We're in a hole." 
</P>
<P>
 * The city of Anaheim turned down an $8.5-million disbursement offered by the 
county because city officials did not want to be restricted to spending the 
money on emergency payroll and purchasing commitments, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 * A federal bankruptcy judge approved $126.6 million in disbursements to some 
investors who sought money from the pool. Among the disbursements were $115 
million to the Orange County Department of Education, community colleges and 
other schools, and $4.6 million to the Orange County Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 * At a Huntington Beach City Council meeting, outgoing Councilman Jim Silva, 
who will be sworn in next month as one of two new county supervisors, said his 
first action will be to propose that the county treasurer be appointed and not 
elected. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva said the treasurer should be selected by the county chief administrative 
officer and approved by the Board of Supervisors. No Limits on Inquiry 
</P>
<P>
 At an impromptu news conference Monday afternoon, Capizzi said the two search 
warrants were the only ones executed in the case so far, but refused to rule 
out future warrants. Nor would he discuss the scope or aim of his case. "We're 
not giving road maps (on the investigation), past or future," he said, adding 
that investigators will not limit their inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office joins a host of other agencies -- including the 
U.S. attorney's office and the Securities and Exchange Commission -- that are 
examining Citron's investments in the wake of the county's bankruptcy filing 
two weeks ago. Much of the investigation focuses on whether Citron misled 
investors and whether brokers sought to influence county officials to gain 
underwriting business by providing them with kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry W. Bird, attorney for acting Treasurer Matthew R. Raabe, said Monday's 
actions by Capizzi's office were unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a criminal case. Why he's executing search warrants on the 
treasurer's office, you'll have to ask him," Bird said. "Somebody decided they 
need to seal it off with a yellow tape. That was not necessary. These people 
would have given them anything they wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, two district attorney's investigators had been rebuffed in 
attempts to speak with Raabe. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, the county auditor-controller, said he had "nothing to fear" from a 
criminal investigation. "My records are open," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators arrived at the county offices about 10 a.m. Salomon Bros. 
officials also were present, said an investigator who declined to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 13 boxes, numbered and labeled "Treas." were loaded into an orange 
van. Computers and other boxes were loaded into a second vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Also at the scene was Deputy Dist. Atty. William Overtoom, who specializes in 
prosecuting white-collar crime, including fraud and embezzlement. Overtoom 
declined to discuss his involvement in the execution of the search warrants. 
</P>
<P>
 County employees gathered a short distance from the commotion. "It's like a 
morgue in there. Terrible, terrible, terrible," said Rena Bugbee, a deputy tax 
collector. 'Stop-Gap Measure' 
</P>
<P>
 As public agencies continued to cope with the fallout from the financial 
crisis, Ron Rus, an attorney who represents six local districts with money tied 
up in the fund, described the emergency disbursement of the $126.6 million as 
"a very interim stop-gap measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't view the amount disbursed on Monday as having any significant impact 
on the interests of other participants in the pool," Rus added. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, officials from some agencies who mistakenly believed that their 
funds were being invested in a separate, safer pool were preparing to argue 
that they should be among the first in line to get their money back. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, the Orange County Transportation Agency, the Orange County 
Sanitation District and 11 other public entities had sunk an estimated $1.3 
billion in less risky investments -- or so they believed. 
</P>
<P>
 In actuality, it appears as if Citron pooled all money in one fund composed of 
numerous high-risk investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly stung by the revelation that apparently no safer pool of funds 
existed was the sanitation district, which invested about $50 million in what 
officials believed was safe on assurances from Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 An April 12, 1993, letter from Citron to district general manager J. Wayne 
Sylvester all but guaranteed that the money would be safe, indicating that it 
was not going into a "commingled fund," but into a separate one with lower 
risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are doing the district an extreme favor," Citron said in the letter. "We, 
therefore, do not want this type of investment transaction disseminated to 
others." 
</P>
<P>
 The confusion over the alleged existence of separate funds was worsened by 
monthly statements from Citron charting performances for both a "bond pool" and 
an "investment pool," the latter believed to have been the higher-risk pool of 
commingled funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Oftelie, chief executive officer of the Orange County Transportation 
Authority, said, "We believed that the bond pool had safer, lower-yield 
investments and the commingled pool had riskier investments." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are supposed to be two pools," said Ken Weel, chief financial officer 
for the Santa Margarita Water District, one of the 13 agencies. "We got 
separate statements on each pool." 
</P>
<P>
 The distinction between the two funds is significant because, under federal 
law, the tax-exempt monies that were pumped into the pool by the 13 agencies 
cannot be used for arbitrage, or borrowing to make a profit. In exchange for 
assuming lower risks, the agencies would receive a lower rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials first received indications that their so-called "safe" deposits 
would be tied up in the financial mess at an investors meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also questioned the propriety of Citron's pooling all the money in a 
single fund, thus subjecting them to the same amount of risk, but paying some 
agencies lower yields. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron's attorney, David Wiechert, did not return telephone calls Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick C. Shea, an attorney with Pillsbury Madison & Sutro, which has been 
retained by a committee of investors seeking return of their money, said it is 
unclear how Citron's accounting methods will affect the disbursement of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Shea said he does not expect the possible claims by some investors that their 
funds are more secure to disrupt the negotiation process or fracture the 
investors committee. Unlike committees in other types of bankruptcy filings, 
"the members of this committee are county agencies and they all live here and 
they're all neighbors forever. It's like they're all married," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shea added that he expects all the investors will receive pro-rated shares of 
money that came into county coffers after the bankruptcy declaration was filed, 
such as recently received property tax revenue. School districts were given 
special assurances from the Board of Supervisors over the weekend that they 
would receive their fair shares of the property tax payments, but Shea said 
other investors should receive the same treatment. Anaheim Decision 
</P>
<P>
 While municipalities throughout the county clamored for cash, Bret Colson, 
spokesman for the city of Anaheim, said officials there turned down an 
$8.5-million disbursement offered by the county because the money could be 
spent only on emergency payroll and purchasing commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is not in emergency mode with respect to payroll and purchasing," 
Colson said. "If (the county) hadn't put any restrictions on it, we would have 
accepted the money to meet general operating expenses." 
</P>
<P>
 Colson said city officials will re-evaluate their position on the disbursement 
after Christmas. The city has $169 million invested in the fund, 20% of its 
total investment portfolio of $874 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana, which defaulted on a $5.3-million debt service last week, will 
learn later this week if the county will release the $9.6 million the city 
needs to continue a massive jail construction project. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get the money this week, we'll be fine," City Manager David N. Ream 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will be forced to halt the project if it cannot come up with the debt 
service payment and the $4.5 million in contractor's fees that are due this 
month. County's Cash Intake 
</P>
<P>
 As creditors continued to pick through the financial wreckage this week, 
county adviser Salomon Bros. revealed that the county's investment portfolio 
will take in only $598 million in cash from the $1.39 billion it raised in last 
week's initial sale of securities. The balance -- $792 million -- went to pay 
down some of the loans still outstanding to the fund from major brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon also said Monday that it had failed to count $390 million in loans in 
its initial valuation of the fund a week ago, when it estimated the total loan 
amount at $2.56 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But Salomon said that because the $390 million loan it missed was fully 
collateralized, the gross market value of the securities in the fund -- listed 
last week as $7.96 billion -- also was undercounted by $390 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The end result, the brokerage said, is a wash. The original $5.03 billion that 
Salomon estimated could be recovered for the fund by liquidating its securities 
still is accurate, the brokerage said. If that much is raised, the fund's 
investors will have lost 27% of their investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon raised the additional $175 million for the fund Monday by selling a 
handful of securities. Negotiations are continuing between Salomon and the U.S. 
government agencies that issued the bulk of the more complicated "derivative" 
bonds owned by the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon hopes to restructure those securities with the agencies rather than 
sell them on the open market, but officials on both sides say they are not sure 
they can strike a deal before January. More on Bonds

BERNSON TO PULL CRA PLAN FOR QUAKE AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Councilman Hal Bernson said Monday he is withdrawing a plan that would have 
provided at least $25 million in earthquake repair funds to property owners in 
the northwest San Fernando Valley, saying that Community Redevelopment Agency 
officials refused to accept a limited role in the rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson's decision means that the neighborhood that lent its name to the Jan. 
17 earthquake may wind up one of the few quake-damaged communities that will 
not receive redevelopment help. He had initially proposed a redevelopment 
project for the Valley's worst-hit neighborhoods in a 21,000-acre swath of 
Northridge, Chatsworth, Granada Hills, Porter Ranch and North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has approved five other redevelopment project areas in the 
Valley and in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 But in contrast to the other plans, Bernson's proposal severely limited the 
power of the Community Redevelopment Agency by, for example, forbidding any 
public works improvements and providing private loan guarantees rather than 
direct loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Advisory committee members also said they wanted to curb traditional CRA 
powers, such as the ability to condemn property. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a district that suffers blight," Bernson said. "This is a 
district that suffers earthquake damage." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson, in refusing the city's help, accused the CRA of trying to foist 
"social engineering" on his district under the guise of earthquake 
reconstruction. City residents in the past have complained of redevelopment 
projects displacing longtime residents to make way for new projects and of 
requiring affordable housing in more affluent neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "The CRA is more interested in securing their future, in securing their jobs 
and their bureaucracy, than they are in serving the people of our district," 
said Bernson, who was joined by members of a citizens advisory panel at a news 
conference Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley residents who helped author the failed redevelopment plan portrayed 
their battle more as a tax revolt, saying they fear an unresponsive city 
bureaucracy would dictate the use of their property tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 But CRA officials say they have tried to help Bernson bring his plan to 
fruition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are here to facilitate, and we have done that," said Peggy Moore, vice 
chairwoman of the CRA. She refused to answer to specific charges leveled by 
Bernson, and said the fate of the plan is up to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson is expected to formally withdraw the plan during tonight's City 
Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle over rebuilding Bernson's district echoes a longtime controversy 
over how and where redevelopment tax money is spent. To fund redevelopment, 
annual increases in property taxes are spent in a specific project area, 
instead of being spent in other parts of the city and elsewhere in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson's plan had been facing opposition and scrutiny on the City Council. 
Other council members said it encompassed too broad an area and that too much 
tax money would be diverted from city services such as schools and police 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bernson has countered that his district suffered 80% of the city's quake 
damage. His proposed redevelopment plan would have paid for itself through 
increased tax revenues once the redevelopment project had ended. 
</P>
<P>
 CRA officials estimate that a redevelopment zone in Bernson's district would 
have diverted $245 million in property taxes over 45 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson's district would have been the largest of the six redevelopment 
projects proposed for the Valley and Hollywood.

CITIES CAN'T AFFORD PLAN FOR POLICE; LAW ENFORCEMENT: PRESIDENT CLINTON NAMES 
VETERAN OF SANTA ANA FORCE TO COORDINATE U.S. EFFORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From staff and wire service reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a result of the recently passed federal crime bill, the Orange County 
Sheriff's Department and 11 cities in the county were authorized Monday to hire 
a total of 49 law enforcement officers with a total of about $3.6 million in 
federal grants. 
</P>
<P>
 But some city officials have said they may not be able to make the hires 
because they cannot afford to match the grants, which the bill requires. And 
that was before the county declared bankruptcy, putting many municipal 
agencies' financial condition in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton authorized 105 cities and counties statewide to begin hiring 
or rehiring 480 law enforcement officers while petitions for federal crime bill 
grants amounting to nearly $36 million are pending. 
</P>
<P>
 The President also named Hayward Police Chief Joseph E. Brann, a 21-year 
veteran of the Santa Ana Police Department, to direct the effort to put 100,000 
new police officers onto the nation's streets, even as House Republicans vowed 
to drastically overhaul the program. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Justice Department ceremony with all the trappings of a campaign 
appearance -- with uniformed police lined up in front of a giant American flag 
-- Clinton announced that 631 jurisdictions have been told to go ahead with 
hiring 4,688 officers while their applications for $327 million are pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, declaring that "this is a very happy day for the people of the United 
States," praised Brann as America's "top cop" and saluted his advocacy of 
community policing, in which officers try to get to know residents of their 
precinct and win their cooperation by solving problems not usually thought of 
as police concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Brann, Hayward chief for nearly five years, previously served in the Santa Ana 
Police Department for until 1989, rising to the rank of patrol and 
administrative captain. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno both condemned efforts by the 
Republicans, with their newly won majorities in the House and Senate, to 
replace the so-called COPS (community-oriented policing services) program in 
the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1994 with block grants that would lessen 
Washington's control over the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The block grants as proposed in the House Republican Conference's Taking Back 
Our Streets Act, to be introduced in the new Congress, would not require that 
the funds be used for community policing. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the COPS program, cities may be obliged to pay 50% or more of the 
average annual salary and benefits to officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no pot of gold at the end of this rainbow," Costa Mesa Police Chief 
David L. Snowden said two months ago. "That's what happens when you get a bunch 
of bureaucrats, who have nothing to do with law enforcement, voting on stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Some departments declared earlier this year that they would not be able to 
participate in the program.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; BROKERAGE OFFERS NEW ESTIMATE OF FUND'S ASSETS, 
LOANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 How much is left in the Orange County investment fund -- really ? 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon Bros. officials acknowledged Monday that they erred last week in their 
initial estimate of the value of the bankrupt fund's securities and the total 
amount of loans it owed. 
</P>
<P>
 But they say the error does not change the most important number -- the $5.03 
billion that the brokerage figures to recover for fund investors by liquidating 
the portfolio's bonds. In other words, investing agencies still are looking at 
a 27% loss on their original principal. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon said it discovered late last week that the fund still owed the Paine 
Webber brokerage $390 million, an amount that was not included in the $2.56 
billion of outstanding loans Salomon listed as of last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the Paine Webber loan, like the other $2.56 billion in brokerage 
loans, was fully collateralized with bonds, the $7.96-billion market value that 
Salomon had placed on the remaining fund assets also was $390 million too low. 
</P>
<P>
 And because the additional loan and additional collateral net each other out, 
Salomon said the unencumbered part of the portfolio -- the amount that belongs 
to fund investors -- stays at about $5.4 billion, of which $5.03 billion is in 
bonds and the rest in cash or cash due. 
</P>
<P>
 In its initial auction sales of fund securities last week, Salomon said it 
raised $1.39 billion. Of that amount, $792 million went to pay off the Paine 
Webber loan and to begin paying off the fund's biggest creditor, Merrill Lynch 
& Co., which had lent the fund about $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The other $598 million raised last week will go back to the fund as cash, as 
will the $175 million raised Monday when Salomon sold six mortgage-backed bonds 
held by the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund still must repay about $2.16 billion in brokerage loans. Most 
analysts have assumed that Salomon would seek to retire that debt early in the 
liquidation process, and sources say Salomon is coordinating its securities 
sales with Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
 After the loans are paid off, all additional proceeds from securities sales 
will flow directly to the fund. But because most of the remaining securities 
owned by the fund are complex "derivative" bonds, they are expected to be 
difficult to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon is negotiating with the four U.S. government agencies that issued most 
of the fund's derivative bonds, attempting to restructure the securities rather 
than sell them in the open market. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts believe that restructuring those securities to eliminate their 
high-risk nature could allow the fund to recover slightly more than Salomon now 
figures the bonds would fetch in the market: 89.9 cents per dollar of face 
value.

CAMARILLO-AREA SITE TO BE SOLD TO CAL STATE; EDUCATION: THE LAND WILL BE 
EARMARKED FOR VENTURA COUNTY'S FIRST FOUR-YEAR PUBLIC UNIVERSITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A lemon grower Monday said he has agreed to sell 200 acres near Camarillo to 
the California State University system, clearing a hurdle that has blocked 
Ventura County from building a public university for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State officials have scheduled a news conference for this morning to 
announce details of the agreement after they inform the Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors of the breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
 If the sale goes through as planned, it would be the first time Cal State 
officials have been able to acquire land for a Ventura County campus in more 
than 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past eight years, university officials have tried to buy two other 
parcels in the county for a campus. But local opposition forced them to back 
away from those deals, making the county the largest in the state without a 
public four-year college. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the break we've been looking for," said Peter MacDougall, chairman of 
an advisory committee of volunteers pushing for a local state university. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Mohseni, whose family owns 200 acres west of Camarillo, said he is 
pleased with the transaction, despite a condemnation suit filed against him by 
Cal State officials to acquire the land. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy to be contributing in a small way to Ventura County being able to 
get a four-year university after 10 or 12 years of effort by the state 
college," Mohseni said. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal calls for the state to acquire 200 acres owned by the Mohseni Ranch 
off Central Avenue, and a neighboring 60-acre parcel owned by Sakioka Farms, 
Mohseni said. Specific terms of the deal were to be disclosed today. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohseni Ranch had refused to sell the property for three years.

4 ARRESTED IN SALE OF 2,000 GUNS STOLEN AT FACTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four Riverside County men have been arrested in connection with the theft and 
sale of as many as 2,000 factory-fresh handguns, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials believe the guns were stolen from Lorcin 
Engineering, a Mira Loma gun manufacturer, by two of its employees and then 
sold wholesale on the street, said John D'Angelo, a special agent with the 
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the guns were brand-new .25-caliber pistols, popular because they are 
easily concealable in the palm of a hand, D'Angelo said. Other handguns 
believed stolen from Lorcin Engineering were 9-millimeter pistols and 
.380-caliber pistols, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lorcin .380-caliber pistol has been the gun most frequently traced by the 
ATF in connection with crimes so far this year, and the Lorcin .25-caliber 
pistol is the fourth most frequently traced gun, D'Angelo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Undercover ATF agents purchased two separate lots of 36 new guns each -- still 
in their factory packaging -- which led to the arrest of the four suspects last 
Thursday, D'Angelo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Lorcin employees, identified by D'Angelo as Jeremy Mendoza, 20, and 
Ernesto Zamora, 22, both of the Riverside-area community of Rubidoux, were 
arrested on suspicion of stealing firearms from a licensed manufacturer. 
Arrested on suspicion of dealing firearms without a license were two Moreno 
Valley men, Anthony Clendenen and Andre Mitchell, both 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza and Zamora are the first in California to be charged under the new 
1994 federal crime bill that prohibits the theft of firearms from a licensed 
dealer, authorities said. Each faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison 
and a $250,000 fine if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, federal authorities prosecuted violations of gun laws only if the 
weapons were taken across a state line. 
</P>
<P>
 The four arrests followed a two-month undercover operation prompted six months 
ago by a Riverside City Police Department gang investigation, D'Angelo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The .25-caliber pistols, which normally sell for about $70, were purchased for 
about $40 apiece in the undercover operation, D'Angelo said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said ATF investigators are auditing Lorcin Engineering to determine how 
many weapons may have been stolen. In 1992, he said, the Riverside County 
company manufactured about 106,000 .25-caliber pistols and about 79,000 9-mm 
pistols.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; SENATE PANEL LOOKING FOR WAYS TO AID COUNTY; 
FINANCES: SEVERAL LAWMAKERS DOUBT THERE IS MUCH THEY CAN DO. 'WE DON'T HAVE THE 
MONEY TO BAIL THEM OUT,' ONE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A special Senate committee began looking Monday for ways to help extract 
Orange County from its investment quagmire, but several lawmakers expressed 
doubt that the state can offer much assistance and glumly predicted that the 
county's financial disaster may only grow worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief of a team trying to restructure the county's investments told the 
14-member panel that Orange County still faces significant risk and could be 
dramatically hurt if interest rates continue to rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not out of the woods yet," said Thomas Hayes, the former state finance 
director dispatched to Orange County to help revive the investment portfolio. 
"This is still too risky a portfolio for a local government." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes outlined how the county fund had lost $2.02 billion -- about 27% of its 
value. But Sen. Daniel E. Boatwright (D-Concord) said he doubted that the 
losses would stop there because the investments Orange County has left to sell 
will probably not fetch attractive prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be very surprised if you can hold this to $2.02 billion and 27%," 
Boatwright said. "I think you're in a fire sale." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes disagreed, saying the "market is with us right now." He conceded, 
however, that Orange County will suffer even bigger losses if the federal 
government continues to raise interest rates, which would cut up to $300 
million from the county investment fund for every 1% increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the committee took no action, the members agreed to meet again early 
next month to explore potential legislation aimed at assuring that no taxpayer 
funds are again exposed to such risk. 
</P>
<P>
 But a warning was sounded by Barbara Coates, president of the County 
Treasurers and Tax Collectors Assn., who cautioned against enacting a "flood of 
legislative proposals" that could end up backfiring in delicate investment 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reforms must be done in a manner that do not cause major (adverse) 
repercussions throughout the state or nation," said Coates, treasurer of rural 
Plumas County. "Reforms need to be well thought out and carefully implemented. 
. . . There needs to be a phasing in of whatever changes are deemed necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Boatwright, meanwhile, raised serious doubts that the state will be able to 
offer much help to Orange County or its cities. "I've got a feeling a lot of 
these local governments are going to come up here with their hands out and ask 
us to bail them out," Boatwright said. "We don't have the money to bail them 
out. . . . We're in a hole." 
</P>
<P>
 Boatwright and Sen. John R. Lewis (R-Orange) peppered a representative of the 
Orange County Department of Education with queries about why the department and 
several school districts borrowed money to invest with the county portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Didn't any alarms go off at all?" Lewis asked. "It strikes me as rather 
unbelievable. . . . I know it's Monday morning quarterbacking, but wasn't there 
any discussion in the department about that at all?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Margarita, the department's business services director, said educators 
had been assured the investments were free of risk. Moreover, educators were 
assuaged because the investments were under the eye of a county treasurer -- 
Robert L. Citron -- who until recently had enjoyed a sterling reputation, 
Margarita said. She also said that school districts lack the expertise to 
properly shepherd their investment funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Boatwright, meanwhile, acknowledged that the state will almost certainly step 
in as required by law if the districts run short of operating cash, but painted 
a bleak picture of what school life would be like. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing parallels with the troubled Richmond Unified School District, which is 
in Boatwright's Senate district, the lawmaker said Orange County school 
children may have to subsist in a Draconian environment where "you may not have 
athletics, you may not have band, you may not have extracurricular activities. 
You may have only the basic core subjects." 
</P>
<P>
 Boatwright also chastised the school districts for borrowing money for what 
ultimately proved to be risky investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was your fault that you went out and borrowed money to invest. 
That's not what school districts in California are for," Boatwright said. 
"They're to educate children, and they're not to borrow money to invest on the 
come, which is exactly what you did. . . . You're not going to get a 
sympathetic ear from me and probably not from some other members of the state 
Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
 At the conclusion of the hearing, Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco) 
distributed a list of 20 witnesses he said should be subpoenaed and compelled 
to testify under oath next month. The list includes former Orange County 
Treasurer Citron and three Merrill Lynch bond brokers with whom Citron did 
business. Others on the list are Jim Bruner, a lobbyist for the law firm of 
Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe, which Kopp called a "major player" in 
government finance. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp said he believes most of the 20 witnesses would appear voluntarily but 
claimed that it would be "futile" to expect some to willingly testify. He said 
all should be subpoenaed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sen. Lucy Killea (I-San Diego), co-chair of the committee, told a reporter 
later that she opposes compelling testimony by subpoena. She said she did not 
believe it was necessary to put witnesses under oath to draft remedial 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need to get all the information, (but) I'm not that interested in 
the finger-pointing and blame-placing" for the Orange County debacle, Killea 
said.

EAST COPIES CALIFORNIA SMOG CURBS; POLLUTION: EPA APPROVES REQUEST BY 12 STATES 
FROM VIRGINIA TO MAINE THAT LOW-EMISSION STANDARDS BE IMPOSED. MOVE IS EFFORT 
TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT. 
</P>

<P>
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Monday took a major step toward 
bringing cleaner cars to 12 Eastern states by approving use of California's 
stringent pollution controls from Virginia to Maine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pleased that the EPA has successfully completed this step toward 
getting cleaner air in our region," said Timothy Keeney, head of the 
Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection and a member of the Ozone 
Transport Commission, a group of state environmental commissioners designated 
by the 12 governors to clean up the region's smoggy air. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, which requires approval by the individual states, cars, 
beginning with 1999 models, will have 70% less emissions than today's new cars 
in Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New 
Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and the 
District of Columbia, according to the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan for the Eastern states is modeled after California's low-emission 
vehicle standards, adopted in 1990, which call for slashing smog-forming gases 
from cars sold between 1994 and 2003. The states, however, did not request 
permission to adopt the most controversial component of California's standards 
-- a mandate for sales of mass-produced electric cars beginning in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee of 12 states requested EPA approval to adopt California's 
special standards because they face a mandate under the federal Clean Air Act 
to clean up ozone, a caustic urban pollutant that forms mainly from motor 
vehicle exhaust. Eleven of the 12 states violate the health standard for ozone 
and must clean up their air or face a freeze on federal highway funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "They asked for it and we've given it to them and now the ball is back in 
their court," said Nancy Sutley, special assistant to EPA Administrator Carol 
Browner. "We had to make a technical finding that they needed (these 
standards). There were a lot of different positions on whether this is the best 
way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 To meet low-emission standards, cars will have to be fueled either by 
alternative fuels such as natural gas, or equipped with such new devices as 
electrically heated catalysts that dramatically cut fumes from gasoline-powered 
engines. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision is a boost to companies and utilities that support alternative 
fuels and to California air-quality officials, who for years have been under 
pressure to scale back their standards that require new automotive 
technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 While it appears something of a setback for the automobile industry, which has 
fought a regional approach to pollution controls and prefers national 
standards, Browner said an industry proposal is still under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that plan, cars that produce less pollution than now, though more than 
the amount permitted by California, would be sold in all 49 states other than 
California. It would override regional requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe this broader agreement would be the most sensible and 
cost-effective way of bringing clean air to Americans," Browner said in a 
statement. "EPA will continue to convene and support negotiations toward this 
broader agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Representing Detroit's Big Three auto makers, the American Automobile 
Manufacturers Assn. said in a statement Monday that the "EPA is sending a 
strong signal to the newly elected governors in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic 
states that one of their first priorities in office must be to tackle this 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The auto manufacturers group estimates that the new 12-state standards would 
add about $800 to the sticker price of a new car beginning with 1999 models, 
compared to $576 under their proposal for a 49-state approach. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials were forced to act this month on the states' plan, which was 
proposed in February, 1993, because Massachusetts and some environmental groups 
threatened to sue. But by simultaneously announcing that the EPA will still 
work toward an alternative agreement, Browner tried to appease the auto 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "This move will mean cleaner air in the Northeast," Alfred Munzer, a former 
president of the American Lung Assn., told Associated Press. "It will help 
reduce the health threat that air pollution poses for children, the elderly and 
many other vulnerable members of the population, especially those with lung 
disease."

STATE'S HEALTH PLAN REVIEW CRITICIZED; MEDICAL CARE: STUDY SAYS OFFICIALS DID 
NOT PENALIZE THOSE THAT GAVE POOR CARE, RESULTING IN A LACK OF IMPROVEMENTS. 
PROVIDERS DISPUTE THE FINDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 California health plans with a history of poor care have not been penalized or 
forced to make improvements, according to a report card issued Monday on HMOs 
and other companies that treat Medi-Cal patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The study by the Center for Health Care Rights, partially funded by the Irvine 
Foundation, examined the state health department's medical audits of seven 
providers since 1990, uncovering "serious quality of care problems" in six of 
them. In some instances, problems found in 1991 or 1992 either did not improve 
or actually worsened in subsequent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The current monitoring system is not working as it should," said Geraldine 
Dallek, the executive director of the Los Angeles-based organization. "The 
central problem . . . is that oversight activities do not appear to result in 
improvement in the continuity and quality of care." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the California Department of Health Services countered that they 
have been "very aggressive in sanctioning plans with poor performance" and 
cited cases several years ago in which financial penalties were assessed 
against two providers. 
</P>
<P>
 Another company, Molina Medical Centers, which was included in the report 
card, was repeatedly cited during the last four years for significant 
deficiencies in its quality of care. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach-based company with 40 clinics statewide won its HMO license in 
March from the Department of Corporations, whose officials had not read the 
critical state health audits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported Sunday that Molina won a contract potentially worth $400 
million in May, after listing state Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles) on its 
board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, who chairs the powerful Senate Health Committee, acknowledged that she 
helped guide Molina officials during their licensing review and was unaware of 
the audits. She said the company may well have gotten its contract because her 
name was listed -- without her permission -- on the company's board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. C. David Molina, who owns the medical chain, denied misusing Watson's name 
and said he never got any special treatment from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 State Corporations Department Commissioner Gary Mendoza said Monday that he 
was making inquiries to his staff to be sure that no improprieties occurred in 
Molina's licensing review. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he would review the new HMO report card along with its suggestion that 
his department hold public hearings before granting companies an HMO license. 
He said he recently implemented a recommendation that licenses not be issued 
until his staff has read a plan's medical audits. 
</P>
<P>
 The report card concludes that state health officials have "failed to monitor 
adequately Medi-Cal managed care plans." 
</P>
<P>
 "When the care is of poor quality, California taxpayers are not getting their 
money's worth and poor mothers and children are being denied the medical 
services to which they are entitled," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report urges state health officials to adopt a "three strikes" policy to 
terminate contractors whose quality of care is rated deficient for three 
consecutive years. Financial penalties should be imposed on plans that fail to 
make corrections as pledged, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials pointed out in response that they fined one plan $17,000 in 
1986 for marketing violations in enrolling new patients and fined another plan 
$295,000 in 1989 for poor quality care. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallek said her report will be sent to the Legislature, where Assembly Health 
Committee consultant Paul Press said it may well prompt the state to collect 
data for its own HMO report. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, Dallek said, the report will be directed to the attention of 
the health committee chaired by Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 "She chairs the legislative committee from which consumers would hope to get 
oversight and relief," said Lourdes Rivera of the National Health Law Program, 
which has accused Molina of a track record of poor care. But Watson's 
connection with Molina now "places consumers in a much weakened position," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Common Cause Executive Director Ruth Holton said there is a need for new 
legislation prohibiting lawmakers from serving on the board of companies doing 
business with the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson has denied that she gave permission for her name to be listed as a 
board member and claims that she resigned as soon as she discovered last spring 
that she had been put on the board. Her letter of resignation was dated about 
four months later, on Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 While she was on the board, Molina received a no-bid contract from state 
health officials that is potentially worth more than $400 million during the 
next three years. Health official Joseph Kelly said his department did not know 
of Watson's connection with Molina. He said the department is required to 
contract with any qualified, licensed HMO that accepts the department's 
non-negotiable reimbursement rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the contract was awarded, the Department of Corporations has conducted 
its own audit of Molina's medical care. In a confidential report dated Sept. 1, 
auditors accused the company of systemically denying necessary medical care to 
its patients to boost its profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said financial concerns do not drive medical decisions. They said 
the company's medical care is not accurately reflected in state audits that 
sample only a small percentage of the clinics' patient files.

SIMON LI SUCCEEDS SHUSTER AS TIMES FOREIGN EDITOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simon Li, a 10-year veteran of the Los Angeles Times who directed the paper's 
coverage of the Persian Gulf War, has been named foreign editor, Shelby Coffey 
III, editor of The Times, announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 47-year-old Li will replace Alvin Shuster, who had headed The Times' 
foreign coverage since 1983. Shuster, a veteran journalist who spent 30 years 
with the New York Times before moving to the Los Angeles Times in 1977, will 
retire Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alvin Shuster is the consummate foreign editor: eloquent, urbane, 
knowledgeable and thoroughly professional," Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has built and led a remarkably impressive foreign staff for the L.A. 
Times, and, as his deputy, Simon Li has had a strong hand in that." Coffey 
noted that the coverage of the 1991 Gulf War "received considerable praise" and 
predicted that Li "will continue that strong leadership for the paper's foreign 
coverage in the years ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Shuster, who will be 65 in January, will continue a relationship with The 
Times as a senior consulting editor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' foreign editor oversees a staff of 30 correspondents, who report 
the news worldwide from bureaus in 22 countries. In addition to the paper's 
daily dispatches of news and analysis, the foreign desk produces the weekly 
section World Report. 
</P>
<P>
 Li, a descendant of a prominent Hong Kong family, was born in London and 
educated at Oxford University. He began his journalistic career in 1965 as a 
reporter for the Hong Kong Standard, and in 1970 he received a master's degree 
from Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism. The following year, 
he joined the Philadelphia Inquirer, serving for 13 years as an editor on the 
foreign, national, opinion, city and business desks. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, Li came to The Times, where he worked as assistant business news 
editor before joining the foreign desk in 1986. He has been the 
second-in-command to the foreign editor since 1990.

HAYWARD CHIEF TO HEAD POLICE HIRING EFFORT; CRIME: CLINTON NAMES 'TOP COP' AND 
SAYS ADDITION OF OFFICERS CAN BEGIN. BUT HOUSE REPUBLICANS VOW TO REPLACE NEWLY 
PASSED PROGRAM WITH BLOCK GRANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton named Hayward Police Chief Joseph E. Brann on Monday to 
direct the effort to put 100,000 new police officers on the nation's streets, 
even as House Republicans vowed to drastically overhaul the program. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Justice Department ceremony with all the trappings of a campaign 
appearance -- uniformed police lined up before a giant American flag -- Clinton 
announced that 631 departments have been told to go ahead with hiring 4,688 
officers while their applications totaling $327 million are pending. 
</P>
<P>
 The jurisdictions include the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, with 
$3,675,000 for 49 deputies; the San Diego Police Department, with $3,525,000 
for 47 officers; the Orange County Sheriff's Department, with $750,000 for 10 
deputies, and the Pasadena Police Department, with $450,000 for six officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, declaring that "this is a very happy day for the people of the United 
States," praised Brann as America's "top cop" and saluted his advocacy of 
community policing, in which officers try to get to know residents of their 
precinct and win cooperation by solving problems not usually thought of as 
police concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Brann, Hayward chief for nearly five years, served in the Santa Ana Police 
Department for 21 years, rising to the rank of patrol and administrative 
captain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to make community policing the American way of law enforcement," 
Brann said. "We must have a national community policing compact that brings us 
together to fight crime -- as chiefs and officers, citizens and leaders, and 
Republicans and Democrats." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Atty. Gen. Janet Reno condemned efforts by the Republicans, with 
their newly won majorities in the House and Senate, to replace the so-called 
COPS (community-oriented policing services) program in the Omnibus Crime 
Control Act of 1994 with block grants that would lessen federal control over 
the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we should turn back on the progress we have made," Clinton told 
an audience of mayors, police chiefs and sheriffs, and members of Congress 
involved in passing the anti-crime package. Justice Department officials and 
attorneys rounded out the crowd. "We shouldn't give up on this community 
policing program." 
</P>
<P>
 The block grants as outlined in the House Republican Conference's "taking back 
our streets" proposal, which is to be introduced in the new Congress, would not 
require that the funds be used for community policing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that this puts an end to any thoughts of moving backwards in 
crime-fighting programs," Reno said. "I will be working with law enforcement 
and local people all across America to prevent any effort to move backwards." 
</P>
<P>
 A Justice Department official involved in the anti-crime legislation who 
declined to be identified said that Senate Republicans are less likely to scrap 
the COPS program than their House counterparts. "They keep decrying 'pork, 
pork, pork,' but they'd be taking away very concrete things and replacing them 
with a giveaway program that promises no results." 
</P>
<P>
 But a Senate Judiciary Committee aide cited two reasons for killing the COPS 
program. He contended that communities are using the federal grants to replace 
police lost through attrition, despite "non-supplanting" provisions in the law. 
More important, he said, the election "taught us" that Americans want the 
federal government to stop telling state and local governments what to do, 
leaving the decisions to the states." 
</P>
<P>
 The community policing concept first won wide federal support during the 
George Bush Administration. Former Atty. Gen. William P. Barr supported 
community policing through the government's "weed and seed" programs, designed 
to "weed out" criminal elements and "seed" areas with reform efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities and counties named in Monday's announcement, which was limited to 
jurisdictions larger than 50,000 people, now can begin recruiting, hiring and 
training officers in anticipation of funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding will begin once the officers have been sworn and a grant application 
has been submitted and approved. Grants will be made for as much as 75% of the 
salary and benefits of each officer over three years, up to $75,000 per 
officer, with state or local funds paying the remainder.

SCIENCE; AT ARIZONA'S NEW ART CENTER, THE PICTURES FRAME THE MUSEUM; AND THE 
PETROGLYPHS FRAME THE QUESTIONS, AS RESEARCHERS STUDY ANCIENT PUZZLES OF 
CULTURE, CREATIVITY AND TIME.

 They passed this way for thousands of years, pausing at a desolate hillside to 
leave their marks. 
</P>
<P>
 Crude drawings of four-legged animals and other creatures of their experience 
were pecked into the volcanic rocks of the Hedgpeth Hills for reasons that are 
not fully understood. Little is known about who they were or why they came. But 
the petroglyphs created over scores of generations shout one message quite 
clearly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing we know about this place is that it was important for easily 
1,000 years, and possibly for thousands of years," says Peter H. Welsh, 
assistant professor of anthropology at Arizona State University and director of 
the university's new Deer Valley Rock Art Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing at the foot of a hill that harbors at least 1,500 petroglyphs, Welsh 
adds: "If there's a message to be learned, it's that people were here. Right 
here. For thousands of years." 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows for sure why they chose this spot. Perhaps a subterranean stream, 
now known as Skunk Creek, rose to the surface when it reached the hard rock 
formation of the Hedgpeth Hills, providing an oasis for weary travelers. For 
whatever reason, they chipped into the rocks along the hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The site now is being set aside so that others can try to understand more 
about those who came this way so long ago. The story is told partly in their 
artwork. The hundreds of petroglyphs that dot the hillside above the art center 
provide the centerpiece for a unique museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which opened Dec. 10, is different in that it combines a public 
showcase of ancient rock art with a tightly focused research mission. Visitors 
can walk along a short trail to the foot of the hills, where petroglyphs can be 
seen in their natural setting. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7,000-square-foot center was designed by noted Phoenix architect Will 
Bruder to blend into the setting. It will provide scholars with access to 
archives and research papers dealing with the interpretation of these 
mysterious symbols chipped into the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Petroglyphs are not rare in the Southwest, but in most cases they are in 
hard-to-reach sites that require considerable dedication just to view them. 
Most of those that are more accessible have been vandalized and looted. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for an occasional bit of modern graffiti, the Hedgpeth Hills site has 
remained relatively untouched -- despite the fact that sprawling subdivisions 
in Phoenix's most rapidly growing area are now only a few hundred yards away. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an important site," says Ken Hedges, a rock art scholar and chief 
curator of San Diego's Museum of Man. "My feeling is that the bulk of the art 
is quite old." 
</P>
<P>
 The site would undoubtedly have been lost had it not been for a series of 
devastating floods in the 1970s. That led to an extensive flood control project 
in north Phoenix, including the construction of the Adobe Dam, designed to 
channel floodwaters away from populated areas. During the construction of the 
earthen dam, the Army Corps of Engineers catalogued a number of petroglyphs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although archeologists and some locals had known of the petroglyphs, as 
evidenced by the date 1933 painted on one of the rocks, the richness of the 
site had not been fully appreciated until the corps began an inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 Archeologists counted 1,500 petroglyphs and identified a number of sites along 
the hills where prehistoric people quarried rock, Welsh says. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the petroglyphs were believed to be the work of Hohokam Indians, known 
to occupy this region from about 700 to 1050, according to Welsh. A Hohokam pit 
house, found in the area where the dam eventually was constructed, was the only 
sign of occupation other than the petroglyphs. The fact that it was discovered 
in a flood control basin is fitting, since the Hohokams are known for the 
extensive irrigation systems they developed throughout this parched region. 
</P>
<P>
 But when archeologists studied the petroglyphs further, they made a surprising 
discovery, Welsh says. Some of the rock art is archaic in style, indicating it 
was created by clans that dated back to 5000 B.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "Archaic rock art in that part of Arizona is little studied and little 
understood," Hedges says. "The archaic stuff tends to get overlooked partly 
because it's older and more patinated and less visible." 
</P>
<P>
 Welsh believes this particular site had been used by many clans over thousands 
of years. Thus the site was singled out by peoples of various cultural 
backgrounds, and they returned to it over and over again. 
</P>
<P>
 The rock art center was funded chiefly by the Corps of Engineers in keeping 
with federal laws designed to protect archeologically significant sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see our mission as being a gateway to the study of petroglyphs and rock 
art," Welsh says, for both the general public and scholars. 
</P>
<P>
 That dual role makes the center somewhat unusual, although students of rock 
art in the Southwest might find the examples here a bit disappointing. Some of 
the petroglyphs have dimmed so with age that the rocks must be studied 
carefully even to see them. They are not as spectacular as those along the San 
Juan River near the Four Corners area, for example. But what sets these apart 
is their apparent age and their accessibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The rock art is subject to wide interpretation, and anthropologists emphasize 
that only the foolish try to be too explicit in their statements about the 
meanings of various designs. Among the most prominent are four-legged creatures 
that resemble deer or elk. Others include simple stick figures of humans, a 
wide range of quadrupeds, snakes and star-like objects. 
</P>
<P>
 Are the petroglyphs a form of ancient graffiti, or high art? 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows, Welsh says. What is clear is that this 47-acre reserve was so 
important that many chose to leave their mark. Perhaps they were establishing 
their claim on the territory, or perhaps they simply wanted others to know they 
had passed this way. 
</P>
<P>
 Petroglyphs have captured the imagination of the public, copied on everything 
from wallpaper to T-shirts, but they have been a source of frustration to 
archeologists. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief among the goals of any archeologist is the desire to establish the date 
when an artifact was created and thus what it can tell us about cultural 
evolution. But that has proved particularly difficult for petroglyphs. 
</P>
<P>
 Since they are literally chipped into stone, the only way to estimate their 
age has been through cultural association -- and that can lead to gross errors 
and a wide range of interpretation. Thus no one is certain just how old the 
Hedgpeth Hills art really is. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without a clear means of getting dates, petroglyphs and rock art have not 
fallen into the mainstream of archeology," says Welsh, former chief curator of 
Phoenix's Heard Museum, a centerpiece in the study of Native American cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 But one researcher who is working with the new center may be onto a process 
that would yield better age estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald I. Dorn, an associate professor of geography at Arizona State 
University in nearby Tempe, is developing a technique that is based on 
independent scientific analysis, and it could move petroglyphs back into the 
mainstream of archeological research. 
</P>
<P>
 Exposed rocks are coated with something called desert varnish, a thin film 
that makes the outer surface of the rock darker than the rock itself. Unlike 
pictographs, where the image was painted on the rock, petroglyphs were made by 
chipping away the varnish with a harder rock, literally carving the image into 
the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 The varnish is caused by bacteria that grow on the rock, leaving a sticky 
substance that concentrates various elements from the rocks as well as from the 
blowing dust. Dorn is working on several techniques, the most direct of which 
involves extracting organic materials that accumulated on the petroglyph after 
the ancient artist chipped away the varnish to create the image. New varnish 
traps and preserves the organic material, which can be carbon dated. 
</P>

 "So we know the rock art has to be at least that old," Dorn said. His results 
so far have been mixed, not always agreeing with well-established dates based 
on cultural association, but he is still refining his techniques. He can shed 
little light on the actual age of the Hedgpeth Hills artwork, but in time he 
may be able to provide a definitive answer, according to several experts 
familiar with his work.

U.S. RESTRICTS COPTER FLIGHTS NEAR N. KOREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Pentagon has temporarily restricted flights of U.S. helicopters near the 
North Korean border and is considering new steps to warn American pilots when 
they are straying too close, the Defense Department said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The restrictions, ordered by Army Gen. Gary E. Luck, commander of U.S. forces 
in South Korea, are expected to be maintained until completion of an 
investigation into the downing of an American helicopter in North Korea late 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. strategists said that the measures, outlined by a senior Pentagon 
official, will not prohibit U.S. pilots from continuing to fly patrols near the 
border with North Korea, as American aircraft have been doing since the Korean 
War in the early 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 The official reiterated that the Pentagon still does not know whether the 
aircraft was shot down by North Korean forces or was forced down because of 
mechanical trouble. But he said all signs continue to suggest that the pilot 
ventured accidentally into North Korean airspace. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement came as senior U.S. military officials made public a detailed 
chronology of the helicopter's path on the day it was downed and discussed the 
kind of training provided to the pilots. But the official declined to speculate 
on why the aircraft went down. 
</P>
<P>
 The OH-58 Kiowa Warrior observation helicopter was being used to train the 
pilot of a newly arrived Apache helicopter battalion on how to navigate inside 
a restricted-flying zone that runs about 22 1/2 miles south of the North Korean 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said that, under new procedures, the battalion will be 
prohibited from flying in the zone, all flights along the area's boundary will 
require personal approval by the battalion commander and pilots will be given 
refresher training. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation of the incident includes reviewing procedures for flights 
near the border and revamping the procedures for warning pilots when they are 
flying too close. The military also is considering whether to upgrade 
navigational aids in the Kiowa. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the OH-58 Kiowa Warrior and most other helicopters are equipped 
only with compasses, not with receivers for the military's new Global 
Positioning System, a satellite tracking network that can tell a pilot 
precisely where the aircraft is. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior military official said Monday that the Pentagon is considering 
upgrading the navigational equipment carried by helicopters to include the 
Global Positioning System, as well as revamping the procedures for transmitting 
warnings from ground observers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials gave this chronology for the incident: 
</P>
<P>
 * The helicopter left its base at Camp Page, near the restricted area, at 
10:02 a.m. Saturday and flew east and north toward the demilitarized zone. At 
10:20 a.m., the pilots changed radio frequency to make contact with a South 
Korean flight-control station. 
</P>
<P>
 * At 10:26 a.m., the control station lost radar contact with the helicopter -- 
not unusual in such circumstances. The South Koreans picked the helicopter up 
again briefly, between 10:36 a.m. and 10:37 a.m., but lost it again. 
</P>
<P>
 * At 10:38 a.m., the helicopter was sighted flying north by a South Korean 
military observer and was seen later by a South Korean guard as it was crossing 
the North Korean border. Neither was able to warn the pilot, however, because 
the guards had no radios. 
</P>
<P>
 * At 10:43 a.m., the helicopter crew reported that it was at "Checkpoint 84," 
in South Korea, but was actually about 11.4 miles north, in North Korean 
territory. At 10:48 a.m., the craft was down.

 More than six pounds of weapons-grade uranium believed to have come from 
Russia has been seized and three men arrested, Czech police said in Prague. It 
wasn't enough uranium to build an atomic bomb, an International Atomic Energy

materials being smuggled out of the former Soviet Union.

shot down two U.S. helicopters over Iraq last April, killing 26.Charges against 
four other AWACS officers were dismissed. The Air Force had earlier dropped 
charges against the pilots of the F-15s that blew the two helicopters out of 
the air over northern Iraq. The accident killed 15 Americans, six military 
officers from Britain, France and Turkey and five Kurdish workers.

counted, officials said the Socialists will command a majority of 125 seats in 
the 240-seat Parliament. Bolstered by the surprising new majority, Zhan 
Videnov, the chief of Bulgaria's Socialist Party, pledged market reforms aimed 
at igniting the country's sputtering transition from central control by 
privatizing the economy and attracting foreign investment.

DEPOSED KING OF CRACK; NOW FREE AFTER 5 YEARS IN PRISON, THIS MASTER MARKETER 
WAS KEY TO THE DRUG'S SPREAD IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If there was an eye to the storm, if there was a criminal mastermind behind 
crack's decade-long reign, if there was one outlaw capitalist most responsible 
for flooding Los Angeles' streets with mass-marketed cocaine, his name was 
Freeway Rick. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't make the drug and he didn't smuggle it across the border, but Ricky 
Donnell Ross did more than anyone else to democratize it, boosting volume, 
slashing prices and spreading disease on a scale never before conceived. He was 
a favorite son of the Colombian cartels, South-Central's first millionaire 
crack lord, an illiterate high school dropout whose single-minded obsession was 
to become the biggest dope dealer in history. 
</P>
<P>
 Working around the clock, taking the age-old axioms of good business to 
ominous extremes, he transformed a curbside operation at 87th and Figueroa into 
the Wal-Mart of cocaine. While most other dealers toiled at the bottom rungs of 
the market, his coast-to-coast conglomerate was selling more than 500,000 rocks 
a day, a staggering turnover that put the drug within reach of anyone with a 
few dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know how some people feel that God put them down here to be a preacher?" 
asked the 34-year-old ex-con, his hands clasped as if in prayer. "I felt that 
he had put me down to be the cocaine man. That's how my environment had twisted 
my mind and molded me. I was so flipped out that I believed I was the Chosen 
One." 
</P>
<P>
 To run an organization of that magnitude, Ross says he relied on a personal 
staff of 15 to 20 henchmen, most of whom were paid $1,000 a week to serve as 
bodyguards, lookouts, drivers, money counters, crack cookers -- even garbage 
men, whose only task was to dispose of incriminating evidence. Day after day, 
they'd pick up million-dollar shipments in armed convoys of inconspicuous cars, 
one of which was always poised to speed off as a decoy. An $18,000 system of 
walkie-talkies, linked to a private channel, kept their movements synchronized. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the neighborhood, Ross had dozens of buildings scattered about to 
conceal his operation, including a warehouse with police scanners and iron 
bars, a cook house with digital scales and a restaurant-quality gas stove, a 
money house with a one-ton safe and currency-counting machines, a rock house 
with an underground tunnel leading from a closet to the street, and a party 
house with a satellite dish, NBA-caliber basketball hoops and a maid. 
</P>
<P>
 One day in 1986, Ross laid all his money on the living room floor and, after 
hours of furious tabulation, found himself staring at a $2.8-million mountain 
of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 His enterprise grew so large -- and so completely unfettered by police 
pressure -- that Los Angeles authorities eventually recruited an elite squad of 
detectives for the sole mission of shutting Ross down. So zealously did the 
"Freeway Rick Task Force" hunt its quarry, however, that the officers were 
accused of crossing into the underworld themselves, allegedly planting cocaine 
on suspects and lining their own pockets with illicit cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Their 34-count federal indictment, a case that became part of the worst 
corruption scandal in local law enforcement history, gave Ross an unexpected 
bargaining chip when he was finally arrested for smuggling cocaine to 
Cincinnati in 1989. In exchange for testifying against the cops who once 
stalked him, crack's dealer to the dealers walked out of prison in September 
after just five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Now back home, living under his mother's roof in Carson, Ross remains 
unrepentant about the destruction his exploits have wrought. He sees himself 
not as a villain but as a slave to his own consuming addiction -- to the 
adrenaline rush of closing a multimillion-dollar deal, to the manic life of a 
high-stakes trafficker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did this all day long, 24 hours a day . . . just like the smoker," Ross 
said. "When I couldn't do it, I was sick, I'm talking about sick . 
Psychologically, I'd be crushed." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has no dearth of skeptics predicting a relapse, Ross says he wants 
to redirect his energy -- and rebuild his fortune -- by constructing a 
South-Central arts and sports complex for the next generation of potential 
crack dealers. It's not so much a moral epiphany as a pragmatic adjustment. 
Having determined that the drug trade is a no-win proposition, he's simply 
looking for a safer game with better odds. 
</P>
<P>
 Most police officials are dubious about Ross' motives, suspecting him of 
trying to buy a veneer of respectability, like so many Mafiosi who have used 
legitimate ventures to conceal illicit gains. What authorities don't doubt is 
Ross' ability to insinuate himself back into a community he once exploited, to 
seize any opportunity that will give him the upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a guy who could sell Popsicles to an Eskimo," said San Fernando 
Police Lt. Ernest Halcon, a veteran undercover detective who has tracked some 
of Southern California's most notorious dope dealers. "You want to say he's a 
low-life, no-good piece of crap. But you got to respect some of these guys for 
their ambition and cunning. You got to give the devil his due." 
</P>
<P>
 The saga of Ricky Ross' rise and fall begins in 1979, when PCP was the drug of 
choice and cocaine was only for the rich. Ross was 19, a car thief of modest 
repute who used to strip his spoils in the shadow of the Harbor Freeway, which 
is how his moniker stuck. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, while cooling his heels after an arrest for grand theft auto, he went 
to visit a friend who had just come home from college. "He's like, 'Man, I'm 
onto something new,' " recalled Ross, who stared in disbelief as he was handed 
a $50 rock. "I was a square. I didn't even believe it was cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
 Eager for a new hustle, though, Ross ventured out and showed off his 
acquisition to an old pimp, who fired it right up and ordered $100 more. That 
day, Ross said, he knew he was going to be rich. 
</P>
<P>
 To get his foot in the market, Ross stole a car -- from the faculty lot of his 
alma mater, Bret Harte Junior High. He sold the rims for $250, which bought him 
nearly an eighth of an ounce of crack. By peddling the rocks individually, he 
reaped a $500 return on his investment, which he continued to "double up," 
turning the $500 into $1,000, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't really understand what I was doing, but I knew I didn't want the 
life my mother lived . . . welfare, no car, waiting till the first of the month 
to have milk and cereal," said Ross, the son of poor East Texas farmers. "I 
knew there had to be something in the world I could do, something that I could 
be the best at." 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Ross made his first economic discovery -- the power of volume. 
Like a supermarket that buys in bulk, thus selling its product cheaper than any 
mom-and-pop store, Ross began sinking everything he had back into dope, 
marveling each time as the unit price dropped. By the end of the decade, he had 
helped cut wholesale rates from $60,000 a kilo to just $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 What truly set Ross apart, however, was the intensity of his focus. While 
others relished the fast lane, Ross cruised incognito in a Brady Bunch-style 
station wagon with simulated-wood siding. He never dipped into his own supply, 
nor did he drink or wear jewelry. A tireless salesman, he lived for the next 
deal, negotiating with a cellular phone pressed against each ear and a pager, 
he says proudly, "that used to sing like a bell." 
</P>
<P>
 "It got to the point where I enjoyed selling drugs so much that I could be in 
bed with my woman and, if the right person paged me, I'd get up," said Ross, 
who is small and wiry at just 145 pounds, with wide eyes and a gleaming smile. 
"I wasn't even conscious of what $2 million was anymore. I wanted $10 million. 
I wanted to set a record." 
</P>
<P>
 First in Los Angeles, then during his cross-country sojourns, Ross used 
charisma and caginess to cross boundaries that had never been breached. Often 
he'd win over turf by donating a few ounces of crack to the area's top dope 
dealer or gangbanger. Sometimes he'd show up in a new place and announce a 
"smoke party," spreading the word that free rocks would be given to the first 
arrivals. In his native Texas, one of several states where Ross had legal 
trouble, he took advantage of old family ties by shipping cocaine to twin 
cousins. 
</P>
<P>
 As implausible as it sounds, Ross insists he never resorted to violence to 
keep a grip on his dominion, though he often took his 9-millimeter pistol to 
the firing range and maintained an arsenal of fully automatic Uzis equipped 
with silencers. Neither was he a true gang member, though he came from a Crips 
neighborhood and didn't mind if their fearsome reputation helped ward off 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement authorities say it is naive to believe that Ross' organization 
never killed or maimed. But Ross contends that his business was simply too good 
to get caught up in bloodshed. If he got ripped off, he says, he would write 
off the loss rather than avenge it. If a rival thought Ross was encroaching, 
Ross used his low prices to turn the competitor into a client. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the market exploded in 1984, Ross already was dealing directly 
with the Colombian cartels, who supplied him with 50 to 100 kilos a day. With 
that, Ross was able to operate dozens of rock houses, catering to thousands of 
addicts across Los Angeles. He had another three "ounce houses," servicing 100 
to 200 mid-level dealers. Finally, he had his own private list of V.I.P. 
customers, maybe 30 to 50 big-time dealers, who dropped tens of thousands of 
dollars at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question about this man's ability to market and merchandise 
things, it's unbelievable, really," said Officer Robert Enoch, a 40-year police 
veteran in Sharonville, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati. "He was instrumental in 
putting this whole thing into motion -- and it's still here. I just don't want 
him back." 
</P>
<P>
 Like his celluloid hero Priest, the slick and stylish pusher in the movie 
"Superfly," Ross also believed that he was just one lucrative deal away from 
leaving the business behind. 
</P>
<P>
 To help make that jump, he built an 18-unit motel, the Freeway Motor Inn, then 
opened a tire shop, the Big Palace of Wheels. He bought a $250,000 home in 
Inglewood, which he paid for entirely in $1 bills. Among his final purchases 
was the old Adams Street Theatre, now gutted and in foreclosure, which he still 
hopes to convert someday into a youth center called the Freeway Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 Fashioning himself into an inner-city Robin Hood, Ross also began making 
donations to South-Central's Algin Sutton park, where he installed new 
basketball hoops and bought eggs every year for the neighborhood Easter egg 
hunt. At his mother's South-Central church, Ross paid for new pews and an air 
conditioner. Every morning, he says, he stuffed his pocket with at least $1,000 
in cash to hand out to anyone needing help. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not guilt that drove Ross to give back to his community. Rather, he 
dispensed gifts just the way he marketed drugs -- commodities to be traded for 
power and respect. "I was the star of the ghetto," he said, "or at least I felt 
like it." 
</P>
<P>
 One night in 1987, the Freeway Rick Task Force almost caught Freeway Rick 
himself, chasing him into a South-Central alley, where he managed to hop a 
fence and escape on a passing RTD bus. As Ross fled, according to the officers, 
he shot at them and dropped a kilo of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 But as part of a massive money-skimming investigation that brought down more 
than two dozen sheriff's anti-narcotics deputies, federal prosecutors contended 
that it was the officers who opened fire on an unarmed Ross, then planted a 
kilo from their own car. Although many of the most serious corruption charges 
were later dismissed, Ross' testimony was rewarded with parole after serving 
less than half of his 10-year interstate trafficking sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ross will fall again someday," predicted former nemesis Stephen W. Polak, an 
ex-LAPD officer who pleaded guilty in October to misdemeanor civil-rights 
violations. "Let him pay for all the people his drugs have killed, let him put 
money into the hospitals for all the addicted babies, let me see him turn over 
a million or two to the IRS and get a job . . . then maybe I'll give him some 
credibility." 
</P>
<P>
 After doing his time for the Cincinnati conviction, Ross served another eight 
months for his Texas case, which brought his story full circle back to Troup 
(Pop. 1,659), the cradle of Jim Crow servility his family exchanged for the 
promise of California when he was 4. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ross was paroled three months ago, he revisited his old boyhood home, now 
a blistered wooden shack, abandoned on a stretch of piney back road in an 
overgrown field abuzz with cicadas. On that steamy late-summer afternoon, as he 
sat on the sagging front porch, he took stock of how far he had traveled before 
succumbing to his own success. 
</P>
<P>
 A bandit entrepreneur who once had it all -- 14th-row Lakers season tickets, a 
38-foot speedboat docked at Marina del Rey, ski lessons in Aspen -- was now 
empty-handed. As difficult as it is to fathom, Ross insists his money was 
consumed by legal fees, rip-offs and bad investments, made worse by signing 
contracts he couldn't even read. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of friends, many of whom had known nothing of crack until he introduced 
them to the trade, are now condemned to jail cells for decades to come. Because 
of Ross, they barely know their own children, just as his children -- seven of 
them altogether, by four different mothers -- barely know him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody loses," Ross said, his head bowed, tears streaming from his eyes. 
"A guy who thought he was so smart had been a fool all that time." 
</P>
<P>
 Now as he lays the groundwork back in Los Angeles for a slew of seemingly 
pie-in-the-sky projects, from producing a rap album to promoting a prize fight, 
Ross is convinced that the world of legal commerce can be his oyster. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference, he says, is the positive new philosophy he's gleaned from a 
most unlikely source, Anthony J. Robbins, the fire-walking self-improvement 
guru of infomercial fame. From Robbins' teachings, which Ross says he studied 
while learning to read in prison, he's discovered he can help others -- and 
make millions too. 
</P>
<P>
 In that respect, Freeway Rick hasn't changed so much since his heady days as 
the cocaine king. Although he's vowed never to revert to selling drugs, he's 
still an unadulterated hustler, doing all he can to relive the thrill of 
hitting it big. Only this time, after the smoke has cleared, he intends to be 
holding the prize. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't you understand? I'm still sick behind this stuff," Ross said. "I need 
my fix."

RELEASE OF EMERGENCY FUNDS OKD; FINANCE: JUDGE'S RULING PROVIDES SCHOOLS, 
CITIES, OTHER AGENCIES WITH $126 MILLION TO MEET PAYROLLS, OTHER NEEDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an emergency hearing Monday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Judge John E. Ryan 
approved the release of $126 million in Orange County funds to schools, cities 
and other agencies that had been in danger of not making payroll and other 
crucial payments. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds had been frozen since Dec. 6 when the county became the nation's 
largest municipality ever to file for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan approved an emergency motion by the Official Investment Pools 
Participants Committee, which was appointed last week by U.S. Trustee Marcy 
J.K. Tiffany to represent the interests of agencies and cities with money in 
the fund. The request had been pared down over the weekend from $153 million, 
after several pool investors voluntarily withdrew or cut back on their requests 
for money. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds, which will be disbursed today, are expected to help pool investors 
with "urgent and essential needs" only through the week. Attorney Patrick Shea, 
who represented the committee at the hearing, said the Orange County Water 
District had just $100,000 in cash left to "maintain water services." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Ryan will be asked to rule on whether investors will be allowed 
to withdraw up to 30% of their original investment in the county fund for 
emergency needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Orange County Board of Supervisors had approved the $153-million 
request last week, the city of Anaheim and the South Coast Water District 
withdrew their requests for $8.5 million and $2.1 million respectively after 
weekend discussions with the committee. The San Joaquin Hills Transportation 
Corridor Agency reduced its request from $20.5 million to $3.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 County bankruptcy attorney Lee Bogdanoff said the committee had acted as a 
"reality check" for the emergency needs of each agency. "They tailored the 
relief to the bare bones," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement approved by Ryan will give the largest amount to the Orange 
County Department of Education, county school districts, community colleges and 
regional occupational programs, which will receive $115 million in all to meet 
payrolls and pay vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Water District will receive $4.6 million to pay for 
essential services. For payrolls, the Orange County Transportation Authority 
will get $3 million and the Orange County Sanitation Agencies will get 
$900,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Bogdanoff said the county has indicated that it needs $25.6 million, but it 
made no formal request for money Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bogdanoff said that when the county does make a request it will be willing to 
"live by the same restrictions" as those governing the districts and cities 
that invested in the ill-fated fund, including the proposed 30% limit for fund 
withdrawals that Ryan is expected to rule on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 County bankruptcy attorney Bruce Bennett said the agencies that withdrew or 
reduced their requests may have done so in anticipation of Thursday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of a more flexible process for getting money took the pressure 
off initial requests, Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shea said that imposing a 30% limit is important because of a need to maintain 
cash in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ryan said Monday that he was not yet prepared to rule on the 30% 
limit, he did indicate that he is likely on Thursday to approve another request 
by the committee. The committee is asking for the right to review and approve 
all future disbursements from the fund before sending them to the judge for 
final approval, Bogdanoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a requirement would prevent any potential "run on the courthouse" by the 
pool's 187 investors demanding all their money at once, Bogdanoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan agreed: "It seems to me that it makes a lot of sense, that before any 
agency thinks it must have a hearing before this court, that it must go through 
a committee process. That's the only way this thing is going to work out with 
any order or consistency or sense. I am not anxious to micromanage the needs of 
180-odd agencies." 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Oftelie, head of the Orange County Transportation Authority, found Ryan's 
comments "extremely encouraging," adding "he clearly understands the importance 
of not disrupting government services." 
</P>
<P>
 Other attorneys at Monday's court session endorsed the need for an 
out-of-court method to deal with future requests for emergency funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get the feeling that the original requests were driven by desperation, by a 
sense of 'We'd better get our funds when we can,' " said Ron Rus, who 
represents several water districts. "But those initial requests were moderated 
down to what's absolutely necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys representing bondholders and companies that do business with the 
county agreed that a process for disbursing emergency funds is needed. But they 
want some safeguards to protect creditors' claims, said attorney Patrick A. 
Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan said the two groups should meet to refine a funding proposal before 
presenting it to him Thursday.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; ANAHEIM TURNS DOWN EMERGENCY CASH; DEVELOPMENTS: 
CITY NEEDS THE MONEY FOR GENERAL EXPENSES AND DIDN'T LIKE LIMITS, OFFICIALS 
SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Anaheim has one of the larger investments in the county's now-frozen 
investment pool, but city officials in Bankruptcy Court on Monday turned down 
an $8.5-million emergency disbursement that could have been used to meet 
immediate payroll and purchasing commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Anaheim, the only city to request emergency money from the court 
Monday, refused to sign an affidavit that would have limited how the money 
could be spent, city spokesman Brett Colson said. The city wanted the money to 
meet general operating expenses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But other cities and school districts said Monday that they could face trouble 
in the next few weeks if they don't gain access to their investments in the 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the county: 
</P>
<P>
 * Irvine Unified School District officials said they aren't sure if they will 
be able to make debt payments after Jan. 3 if they can't get some of the $102 
million they invested in the county pool. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Monday school board meeting, officials said they are optimistic about 
being able to meet payroll, vendor warrants and other operating costs through 
March. They also said the district probably will be able to make an 
$8.4-million bond payment due Dec. 31 and a $1.6-million payment due Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 But all bets are off after the first week of January, they said. In June, the 
district faces a $54-million debt payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Hank Adler suggested that the district begin preparing an austere 
budget that assumes the district will not recover $30 million from the pool. 
But other board members said it is too early to assume such a large loss. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Laguna Beach Unified School District is in the process of preparing just 
such a budget, said Supt. Paul M. Possemato. 
</P>
<P>
 Possemato will present to the school board Wednesday a series of suggestions 
that will detail how they will operate if they suffer a 30% cut in revenue. The 
list could include hiring freezes for employees other than teachers, 
discontinuing workshops and halting "nonessential" purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 * Placentia will ask for $700,000 from the pool in Bankruptcy Court on 
Thursday. The money is needed to pay the county for fire and paramedic services 
for the last three months of this year, said Finance Director Howard Longballa. 
</P>
<P>
 * Santa Ana also will be in Bankruptcy Court on Thursday. The city has asked 
for $9.6 million from the pool to proceed with their massive jail construction 
project, including a $5.3-million bond interest payment due last week that 
hasn't been paid and $4.5 million due this month for contractor fees. The city 
does not need the money for general operating expenses, City Manager David N. 
Ream said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ream said at Monday's City Council meeting that the city has received 
assurances from the county that they will receive the funds required to keep 
the jail project on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 * Officials in the Brea Olinda Unified School District said Monday that they 
will not be able to make a Jan. 5 debt payment of $610,000 unless they have 
access to a portion of the district's $7-million investment frozen in the 
county pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also said the district's reserves could help them absorb some losses 
of their investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our reserves are for future emergencies," said Assistant Supt. Gary D. Goff. 
"Little did we know that this would be the emergency." 
</P>
<P>
 * Anaheim City School District officials said Monday that the bond crisis has 
complicated their plans to accommodate an anticipated 700 added students next 
year. The crisis might make it impossible for the district to buy bungalows or 
convert additional schools to year-round schedules, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Anaheim city officials said the city has $169 million in the county pool, or 
20% of its $874-million investment portfolio. The first sign of trouble could 
come in April when Anaheim must pay back a $94-million loan it took out to 
invest in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The city must come up with $99.8 million to pay back the loan, which will be 
difficult if it does not receive a scheduled $100-million disbursement from the 
county, Colson said. 
</P>
<P>
 New Councilman Bob Zemel is critical of the city for borrowing the $94 million 
to invest in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it had been presented to me that we were going to borrow $94 million and 
invest it, I would have voted against it," Zemel said. "I don't think that's 
prudent. We're caretakers and can't gamble like that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim City Council will meet in closed session tonight for an update on 
the county's financial crisis and will then make a presentation to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Other city councils meeting tonight are those in Fountain Valley, Fullerton, 
La Palma, Laguna Niguel, Lake Forest, Placentia, San Clemente, Tustin and Yorba 
Linda. The North Orange County Community College District board is also meeting 
tonight.

THOUSAND OAKS MAN GUILTY IN NURSE'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County jury Monday convicted a 20-year-old Thousand Oaks man of 
murder with a special circumstance that could send him to the gas chamber for 
last year's slaying of Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Scott Thornton sat quietly as Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath 
read guilty verdicts to the 13 counts he faced. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Sullivan disappeared on her way home from work Sept. 14, 1993, after running 
some errands. Later that day, police began a manhunt for Thornton, after he 
kidnaped his 16-year-old girlfriend from her Westlake home. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities did not suspect a link between the two crimes until they arrested 
Thornton in Reno five days later. He was driving the nurse's Ford Explorer 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 26, seven days after his arrest, the nurse's body was found in a 
desolate area of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Sullivan was shot after she was ordered to her knees, prosecutors said. In 
about three weeks, the jury will begin hearing evidence to decide if Thornton 
should receive the death penalty or life in prison without parole.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; DAILY DEVELOPMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's how events surrounding the county's ongoing bankruptcy crisis unfolded 
Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Orange County district attorney's investigators removed boxes of documents 
from the treasurer-tax collector's office and also collected audits of the 
county investment portfolio conducted by the county auditor-controller, Steve 
E. Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salomon Brothers, the company handling the liquidation of the county's fund 
portfolio, said the county will realize $598 million from the $1.39 billion 
raised in the first sale of securities.The nearly $800-million balance was used 
to settle outstanding loans to the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 * The City of Anaheim decided against accepting an $8.5-million disbursement 
from the county, because the money would have been restricted to emergency 
payroll and purchasing commitments. The city will re-evaluate its position 
after Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 * A special state Senate committee met for the first time to discuss 
legislative reforms to prevent bankruptcies similar to Orange County's. 
</P>
<P>
 * Disbursements totaling $126.6 million were approved by a federal bankruptcy 
judge -- chief among them, $115 million to the county Department of Education, 
community colleges and other schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Securities and Exchange Commission filed the necessary documents 
allowing it to become part of the bankruptcy proceedings and monitor 
distribution of funds.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; ROAD PROJECTS TO GO AHEAD, OFFICIAL SAYS; 
CONSTRUCTION: COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY SAYS ONGOING WORKS, SUCH AS THE 
SANTA ANA FREEWAY WIDENING, WILL PROCEED DESPITE THE COUNTY'S BANKRUPTCY. 
</P>

 Jim Kenan, director of finance and administration for the Orange County 
Transportation Authority, reassured employees Monday that regardless of the 
county's bankruptcy, the transportation agency should be able to complete 
ongoing projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the short term -- and the long term -- we will be fine," Kenan said 
Monday during a quarterly employee's meeting. "But it is going to be a struggle 
over the next couple of months." 
</P>
<P>
 The transportation authority is the single largest investor in the troubled 
county investment pool, which this year has lost $2.02 billion, or 27% of its 
value. The agency has more than $1 billion invested with the county, and 
questions have surrounded its ability to complete several major road projects 
underway in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenan told the audience that if all goes well, none of OCTA's major projects 
will suffer, it will be able to meet its nearly $6 million monthly payroll and 
it should be able to make a $46 million bond debt repayment, due Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction will go on as planned on the $2-billion widening of the Santa Ana 
Freeway, including improving the interchange connecting it with the Costa Mesa 
Freeway and with the Garden Grove and Orange freeways, he said. The addition of 
new lanes and on- and off-ramps at the El Toro "Y" will also be unaffected, as 
will the addition of car-pool lanes to Interstate 5 south of its intersection 
with the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kenan said this plan depends upon the transportation authority receiving 
continued assistance from state government, which is not guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 It must have its state sales tax proceeds, which are normally channeled 
through the county before they reach the agency, instead placed directly in 
OCTA's treasury. Such appeals are now being made by OCTA in bankruptcy court 
and would bring the agency an additional $5.8 million per month. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales tax revenue, however, will not be enough. Kenan said OCTA is petitioning 
both state and federal sources for additional advances on anticipated funds. 
Gov. Pete Wilson acting to expedite the disbursement of $15.2 million of state 
funds to the authority last week was a heartening sign, Kenan said, adding that 
he expects other government agencies also to be cooperative.

U.S. MAYORS SEE RISE IN HUNGER, HOMELESSNESS

<TEXT>
<P>
 With the toughest part of winter ahead, the nation's mayors reported that 
emergency food requests in major cities have jumped 12% in the last year. 
Requests for emergency shelter have risen even more. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10th annual report on hunger and homelessness by the U.S. Conference of 
Mayors, released Monday, warned that emergency food centers and homeless 
shelters in many cities may have to turn away needy people because of 
insufficient resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in fear that some child will freeze to death," Detroit Mayor Dennis 
Archer told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the report's recommendations: 
</P>
<P>
 * Federal public housing and rental assistance programs should be expanded. 
</P>
<P>
 * The minimum wage should be raised. Job training should be expanded and new 
jobs should be created by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drug and alcohol abuse programs, as well as mental health services and 
child-care programs, should be expanded.

ADMINISTRATION SEES A 'REINVENTED' HUD; GOVERNMENT: SECRETARY CISNEROS SAYS 
ASPECTS OF AGENCY ARE 'INDEFENSIBLE.' HE ENDORSES PROPOSAL TO STREAMLINE 
BUDGET, SET UP VOUCHER PROGRAM. 
</P>

<P>
 The Department of Housing and Urban Development was born nearly three decades 
ago out of a simple dream: every American, regardless of economic status, 
deserved a decent place to live at an affordable price. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was to ensure housing for the urban poor and stimulate the housing 
industry by making home ownership easier for middle-income families. It 
amounted to a bold experiment in giving new life to the nation's troubled 
cities, particularly after the devastation of the 1960s riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, riddled by scandals and bureaucratic incompetence throughout its 
history, the department has never lived up to that lofty promise. On Monday, 
the Clinton Administration declared it a failure -- but insisted that its 
mission is far from dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The department is one "that deals with some of the most troubling situations 
in American life -- people who are very poor who live in our cities, problems 
of race and class in America's most troubled neighborhoods -- but it does not 
follow from that challenge that the department must function as it has," said 
Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros, speaking with startling candor in a series 
of news conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Indeed, many aspects of this department are simply indefensible," he added. 
"Change is necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is proposing a "reinvented" department that, officials 
said, would put more power in the hands of cities and states and the poor 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The department's $30-billion annual budget is to be cut by $800 million over a 
five-year period to help pay for President Clinton's middle-class tax package. 
The cut amounts to only a small part of the $24 billion in total cuts expected 
to be imposed on five targeted federal agencies. Even so, the change in the way 
Housing and Urban Development does business would be vast, officials of the 
department predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "HUD, for its part, has allowed itself to evolve into a bureaucracy far more 
attentive to process than to results, characterized by slavish loyalty to 
non-performing programs and insufficient trust in the initiatives of local 
leaders," said a department statement. "These are undeniable truths." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, as outlined by Cisneros and other officials, would consolidate 60 
existing public housing programs into eight new performance-based grant 
programs in 1996 and by 1998 would be compressed into just three programs. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those three would modify and greatly expand a system that provides poor 
people with housing vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Individuals would have control over their destiny by having a voucher in 
their hands," Cisneros said. "They will be able to make the choice as to 
whether they want to stay in places that are unacceptable or, in effect, vote 
with their feet and move to another location. We're, in effect, changing HUD's 
constituency from the bureaucratic entities of housing authorities . . . to the 
residents." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, states would receive funds in the form of block grants to acquire or 
rehabilitate housing to be used for low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 And, finally, the Federal Housing Administration, which provides loans for 
low- and moderate-income Americans seeking to buy homes, would be transformed 
into a government-owned corporation, functioning as a private financial 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
 "FHA is a 60-year-old institution too frequently characterized by 
bureaucracy," Cisneros said. In its place, the government would create a 
government-owned corporation that would "function in the marketplace as the 
modern, competitive insurance company that it is." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're convinced that this is the right way for the department to carry out 
its mission," Cisneros said. "We have a big job before us." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, however, local housing officials said they were worried about 
the possible effect on low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Housing Authority, which owns and administers about 10,000 
HUD-supported apartments, would do its best to compete for proposed block 
grants and to operate more like a a private landlord, said executive director 
Donald J. Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he is skeptical that new rental vouchers would provide enough to 
replace the $134 million that the agency received in federal subsidies for 
maintenance, modernization and other uses in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith speculated that federal support for public housing could be cut in half. 
"We expect them to underestimate the amount of modernization needed" at the 
projects, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary W. Squier, general manager of the Los Angeles Housing Department, said he 
fears that people with special needs, such as the elderly, homeless and those 
afflicted with AIDS, might suffer if programs for them are merged into block 
grants. He also said that Los Angeles might lose a great deal of assistance if 
the state becomes the administrator and feels compelled to spread the money to 
other communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The impact is unknown at this point but it's going to be substantial," said 
Squier, whose department this year channeled $95.4 million in HUD funds, mainly 
for low-interest loans for homeowners and developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Can the Clinton Administration's proposals ultimately rescue the department? 
Some former officials think so. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first big grin I had was when I heard they were going to turn it over to 
the people closest to the problems," said James T. Lynn, housing secretary in 
1973-'74 during the Richard Nixon Administration. "That was what we tried to 
say, over and over."

JAPANESE SAW EARLY SCRIPTS FOR A-BOMB EXHIBIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Smithsonian Institution allowed Japanese officials an early glimpse at 
scripts for a much-disputed exhibit on the atomic bombing of Japan in 1945, 
Rep. Sam Johnson (R-Tex.) said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson provided minutes from a July 5, 1994, Smithsonian National Air and 
Space Museum senior staff meeting that indicate communications with Japan over 
the script for "The Last Act: The Atomic Bomb And The End Of World War II." 
</P>
<P>
 The minutes read: "The Japanese version of 'The Last Act' script has been 
Federal Expressed to Japan, asking for a quick response." 
</P>
<P>
 Air and Space Museum spokesman Mike Fetters acknowledged that at least three 
versions of the script were sent to city officials in Nagasaki and Hiroshima. 
But Fetters denied that the Japanese were allowed to make any changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson still questioned the propriety of the Smithsonian's actions, saying 
the institution was allowing the Japanese input that it didn't provide to U.S. 
veterans groups.

U.S. MISSION WENDS THROUGH AN AFRICA STRUGGLING TO CHANGE; DIPLOMACY: NATIONAL 
SECURITY ADVISER ANTHONY LAKE IS TRYING TO BOOST DEMOCRATIC HOPES. HIS 
EIGHT-DAY TRIP IS TAKING HIM TO NINE NATIONS. 
</P>

<P>
 In the torpid heat of the Mozambican summer, in a village far from paved roads 
and running water, National Security Adviser Anthony Lake sat on a stool and 
heard the story of fisherman Jose Chemane Bizho -- the simple story of Africa's 
fragile hopes and frightful danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was young," said the bearded fisherman, "I joined the army for two 
years. But I fought on for 17. Today, I want my own fishing project. I'm 
looking for somebody to support me and buy me some nets." 
</P>
<P>
 Here in the south of Africa, sounds of gunfire have died out. A brutal civil 
war has ended. The same is true in Ethiopia to the north, Rwanda in the center. 
Even Angola in the west is struggling from the exhaustion of war and searching 
for the terms of a peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Soldiers are being asked to become citizens, voters, fishermen. New leaders 
with business suits and college degrees are trying to build nations in a fresh 
model. 
</P>
<P>
 So on a sweeping pre-Christmas tour of transitional Africa, Lake, the 
preeminent Clinton Administration expert on the subject, has been sifting 
through the ashes of continental catastrophe to stir up embers of hope. 
</P>
<P>
 He has rejected America's "Afro-pessimism" and championed the emerging 
generation of African leaders and their commitment to democracy. 
"Afro-realism," he calls it. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also sounded a warning: This may be Africa's last chance. The vast 
energies spent on destructive political struggle must now weave the fisherman 
his nets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world around Africa is fast coming together. And this continent risks 
being the odd man out," Lake said in a speech in Ethiopia to the Organization 
of African Unity. 
</P>
<P>
 By happenstance, Lake's nine-country, eight-day hopscotch across the continent 
with a delegation of military officers, diplomats and scholars comes at a 
significant moment in African history and in Africa's post-Cold War relations 
with America. The trip had been long planned and often postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lake finally made his way to the continent last week, Ethiopia -- his 
first stop -- adopted a new democratic constitution that promises its fractious 
ethnic groups the right to self-determination. He arrived in Rwanda as a new 
Parliament was seated. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mozambique, the newly elected president appointed his government on the eve 
of Lake's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake stopped in Burundi as moderates faced extremists in their long ethnic 
struggle for that small Central African nation. In Zambia to the south, the 
national security adviser took the measure of a young and peacefully achieved, 
if imperfect, democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Also during his trip, Angola has wobbled on the unsteady legs of a Nov. 22 
peace accord -- still skirmishing and still talking after 19 years of civil 
war. "End the hostilities once and for all," Lake urged the warring factions 
Monday, at the beginning of a two-day visit. "The time has come to match your 
words with actions." 
</P>
<P>
 Lake plans to continue on to the western coastal nations of Benin and Ghana, 
other potential showcases of African progress. And he is to wind up his trip on 
the far western edge of the continent in Senegal, noted for its stability. 
</P>
<P>
 For all that, however, the American delegation has been on the defensive. 
After a failed peacekeeping effort in Somalia and following the senseless 
horrors of Rwanda, the American public seems to have lost its stomach for 
Africa. The United Nations is stretched thin. New Republican leaders of 
Congress want less engagement here, not more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognize signs of hope," Lake said. "But many African nations are but one 
step away from crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 Why should America care? Because it is in the heart of Americans to care, said 
Lake. "And we care because the great global challenges of tomorrow can be seen 
in the challenges facing Africa today." 
</P>
<P>
 This theme of longing versus despair is not Lake's alone but also has been 
voiced along the way by scores of Africans. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ethiopia, scholar Jalal Abdel Latil said his country's move away from 
authoritarianism "is irreversible. They are dismantling the old order. The 
trouble is, nobody has a model for a new order." 
</P>
<P>
 In Rwanda, where ethnic divisions are so powerfully deep that few people can 
be truly optimistic, Mache Nkongoli is vice president of the new Parliament. 
There is no money for hotel rooms to house representatives from out of town; 
there is only one photocopying machine, and the rain still comes through shell 
holes in the Parliament building. "But the positive thing is that our 
representatives are here and ready to work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Zambia, a multi-party election in 1991 peacefully brought down a 27-year 
ruler. But one election does not create a democracy. "Our next election will be 
the hard one," said Foston Kakala, a Zambian democracy advocate. "In 1991, 
there was one common enemy. In 1996, it will be more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Lake's diversions have showed the two sides of Africa. One morning, his 
party flew by helicopter to Moamba, Mozambique, where platoons of ex-soldiers 
are clearing anti-personnel mines, inch by painful inch, from the land. With 
the detonation of a string of freshly found Russian mines, the smell of cordite 
was still raw on the sweltering breezes. 
</P>
<P>
 Six hours later, Lake drove to a Zambian wild game ranch outside Lusaka. With 
his field guide to birds, he correctly identified the bird on the Zambian 
currency as the fish eagle. His party also discovered a nest of young pythons 
and a profusion of African antelope. And they watched the sun drop over the 
savanna, turning the sky the bright color of blood. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials seemed to indicate that Lake's foray, one of several 
high-level Administration missions to Africa in recent months, is a prelude to 
a presidential visit to the fast-changing continent in 1995. However, it has 
not been simple to determine where an American president should go, except for 
South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what, Africa is at the bottom of America's priorities. And it's 
going to stay there for a long time," said Shawn H. McCormick, an Africa 
specialist who is traveling with Lake from the Washington, D.C., Center for 
Strategic and International Studies. "For it to move up, something else would 
have to fall behind. What would that be? Europe? Asia? Latin America? Russia? 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's still an exciting time here. After colonialism and since the Cold 
War, now is the time Africans can decide for themselves what to do. The 1990s 
will be the decade when Africa defines its own future. You could argue it has 
no other choice." 
</P>
<P>
 On this path, Africans feel an urgent dependence on America and the West, as 
much now as ever. In Mozambique, 71% of the government budget comes from 
outside donors. In Zambia, the amount is almost as high. In Rwanda, the 
government has virtually no resources at all except what it is given. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cynics, from both the West and Africa, see multi-party democracy as just 
a continuation of what happened during the Cold War -- rich, domineering 
nations imposing their view of government by checkbook. And African leaders 
respond to please: The civic leaders of the Zambian capital recently changed 
the name of Saddam Hussein Boulevard to Los Angeles Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 So, naturally, African leaders are openly nervous about the American political 
mood. The Cold War may have had room for corrupt and inept governments, but not 
this new lean-and-mean trans-global economic order. 
</P>
<P>
 In Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, an African diplomat said he was impressed by the 
Clinton Administration delegation. But he said to Lake, "For all your goodwill 
and noble protestations, you may not have the wherewithal to realize your 
ideals." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, replied Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Africa should not "over-read" the results of the American 
congressional elections. "We will continue to work with the leadership of the 
Republican Party and with the Republican moderates who are dedicated to 
engagement in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 But he added: "We need to be able to show results, practical results. . . . In 
Africa, and elsewhere, the windows of opportunity can remain open for only so 
long. . . . The warlords -- and, tragically, their people -- cannot always 
count on an international safety net."

RUSSIA STEPS UP BOMBING NEAR CHECHEN CAPITAL; CAUCASUS: KREMLIN IGNORES NEW 
APPEAL FOR TALKS. SEPARATIST ARMY ASKS NEIGHBORING REPUBLICS FOR AID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Russian troops edged toward the capital of breakaway Chechnya and pounded its 
outskirts with almost continuous bombing Monday in a sharply escalating assault 
on the heavily armed republic as it pressed its bid for independence. Some 
bombs struck near the city center. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 24 hours after Chechen President Dzhokar M. Dudayev spurned Moscow's 
last offer of peace talks Sunday evening, the thunder of artillery and the 
crunch of bombs audible in Grozny, the Chechen capital, grew from an occasional 
explosion to regular booming. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudayev issued a terse new appeal for peace talks, but the Kremlin ignored it. 
As the mighty Russian army and this tiny Muslim republic braced for intense 
combat, the Chechen military command appealed to neighboring republics in the 
Caucasus Mountains to "rise up and repel the aggressor." 
</P>
<P>
 One armored column pushed to within five miles of Grozny from the north after 
capturing the armed village of Petropavlovskaya, while a second column was 
bogged down in tank and small-arms battles in Dolinskoye on the city's western 
outskirts. 
</P>
<P>
 As a heavy snow blanketed this oil-refining city, it was not clear whether 
those troops had received orders to move in for what would certainly be a 
caldron of urban guerrilla warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 But after deliberately sparing Grozny's 200,000 people from air assaults, 
warplanes swooped low over the city Monday night and dropped at least two 
bombs, briefly knocking Chechen television off the air, setting four houses 
ablaze and destroying at least six others. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials said two people were killed and eight injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Scattered bombs and artillery began falling on Grozny's outskirts early Sunday 
within minutes after the Kremlin's midnight deadline for the surrender of 
Dudayev's several-thousand-strong irregular forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian officials in Moscow said Sunday's shelling crippled 16 rebel tanks and 
armored personnel carriers, five aircraft, two artillery guns, a missile 
launcher and an ammunition depot. 
</P>
<P>
 Warplanes and artillery also targeted Dudayev's family compound in the suburb 
of Tashkala and Grozny's electricity plant Sunday but missed. Instead, they 
scored direct hits on such objects as the muddy back yard of pensioner Yevgenya 
Pogosian. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't know where they're shooting," said Pogosian's neighbor, Tamara 
Idriseva, whose two-story home had the post-earthquake look of shattered 
windows and cracked ceilings. "They should just fight among themselves. They 
should leave us alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Pogosian's home, where she had lived since 1984, was broken open like a 
dollhouse. Although Moscow has said it was not targeting civilian sites, the 
general fear that Russian raids have sown among Chechnya's population also had 
a tactical effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "What could be more strategic than demoralizing the people?" asked Musa 
Mirzhuyev, Dudayev's liaison with the Chechen armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Russia's military aim was clearly the conquest of Grozny but warned 
that even if the capital falls to Moscow's superior might, that will not be the 
end of the war. 
</P>
<P>
 "Classical military thinking says that once you capture the capital, the war 
is over," Mirzhuyev said. "But the Chechens have fought Russia for 300 years, 
and we don't plan to sign any surrender." 
</P>
<P>
 Russian military analysts have predicted that Moscow will use special 
commandos in a pinpoint operation against Dudayev's nine-story presidential 
palace in central Grozny. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mirzhuyev scoffed, "The Russian empire never was capable of using a 
scalpel -- it always barged into other people's gardens with a bear's paws." 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian escalation, launched after a government decision to "activize" its 
operations in Chechnya, was formally aimed at disarming Dudayev's forces, which 
the Kremlin refers to as "illegal armed bands" and "bandit formations." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Russian troops that poured into Chechnya on Dec. 11 had a clearly 
political goal: to bring the breakaway republic of about 1.2 million people to 
heel and break its bid for independence once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
 Chechnya broke away from Russia in November, 1991, and played a dangerous game 
of brinkmanship with the Kremlin for the next three years -- until Russian 
President Boris N. Yeltsin's patience ended and he instructed his Cabinet to do 
whatever it took to impose Moscow's control in the North Caucasus republic. 
</P>
<P>
 The mass entry of troops, Moscow's biggest military operation since the Soviet 
war in Afghanistan in the 1980s, has united most of the Russian political 
spectrum and public opinion against Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Lt. Gen. Valery Vostrokin, an Afghan War veteran who is Yeltsin's 
deputy minister for emergency situations, joined in urging the president to 
call off the Chechnya campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be the aggressor, a policeman on our own territory is not a good job for 
the military," Vostrokin told reporters in the Caucasus republic of Ingushetia, 
where he was coordinating relief efforts for an estimated 100,000 refugees from 
Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is possible to solve this problem by taking out the troops and 
letting Chechnya solve its own problems," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 In Moscow, authorities prepared for possible retaliatory strikes by Chechen 
guerrillas by parking armored personnel carriers along Moscow's six-lane outer 
Ring Highway to reinforce police checkpoints. 
</P>
<P>
 The offensive in Chechnya hit major snags at first when people in neighboring 
Caucasus states tried to block the passage of Russia's armored columns toward 
Chechnya's borders. One Russian column bogged down inside Chechnya when its 
commander refused to advance if that meant clashing with civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 But by Monday night, Russian troops were closing in on Grozny from the north 
and west. Grozny residents, already weary from repeated nights of sleep broken 
by the thumps of bombing, had been informed of the locations of the nearest 
air-raid shelters. Some were already spending the nights in their basements. 
</P>
<P>
 At Dudayev's presidential headquarters, whole sides of beef and giant bags of 
onions along with the usual rows of bread loaves were stacked in the downstairs 
lobby, ready for a siege. 
</P>
<P>
 One defender of the headquarters said Dudayev had run out of guns to give his 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudayev is known to possess several Russian tanks captured in an attempted 
storming of Grozny on Nov. 26 by anti-Dudayev Chechen forces backed by Russian 
troops and planes. The Chechens are also reported to have large arsenals taken 
over after the Soviet army fell apart. 
</P>
<P>
 But the typical Chechen unit probably resembles the small squad of bearded, 
red-eyed men sitting around a smoking campfire Monday 10 miles east of Grozny 
in the hamlet of Shaami-Yurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with a grenade launcher along with their personal semiautomatics, the 
Chechen fighters had finished digging their trenches and turned to the more 
pleasant task of boiling a caldron of lamb meat. 
</P>
<P>
 They had no official ranks, said Khusan Isabayev, the 34-year-old commander. 
And the squad had no real name or number except for its classification as a 
scouting and diversionary unit. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last two weeks, they had been guarding this stretch of the Moscow-Baku 
road and had managed to shoot down a Russian helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 What bothered them most, Isabayev said, was that Russian planes and 
helicopters would fly over them and go on to bomb people's houses in 
neighboring villages instead of engaging head-on. 
</P>
<P>
 "The military site is here," he said. "Kill me, OK? But they send rockets and 
kill the villagers. They killed four people here."

 Seven people froze to death on Moscow streets over the weekend in the coldest 
weather for the date in the Russian capital in more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the victims were drunk, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 December has been cold and snowy in Moscow. The overnight temperature dipped 
to minus 14 degrees Fahrenheit early Monday, said Alexei Yakovlev, a spokesman 
for Russia's weather service. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the lowest temperature recorded at this time of year in more than 100 
years, Yakovlev said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow hospitals admitted 60 people with hypothermia over the weekend, 
including seven who died, Yakovlev said.

ITT OFFERS $1.7 BILLION CASH FOR CAESARS WORLD; GAMING: THE DEAL WOULD BE THE 
LARGEST SINGLE INVESTMENT IN THE HISTORY OF LAS VEGAS. CAESARS' STOCK SOARS 
NEARLY 50%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Placing an unprecedented bet on the future of the gambling industry, 
conglomerate ITT Corp. on Monday agreed to buy Los Angeles-based Caesars World 
-- owner of the famed Caesars Palace on the Las Vegas Strip -- for $1.7 billion 
in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement sent Caesars' lagging stock soaring nearly 50% as some 
industry observers suggested that ITT -- which is expanding in the professional 
sports, cable and leisure industries -- will be joined by other giant 
entertainment companies interested in the fast-growing gaming business.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's the entertainment dollar that all these companies are competing for," 
said gambling industry expert Marvin Roffman, a partner in Philadelphia-based 
Roffman Miller Associates. "Gaming really is the entertainment business." 
</P>
<P>
 ITT's offer would be the single largest investment in gambling and Las Vegas 
ever -- topping the $1-billion invested by financier Kirk Kerkorian in building 
the new MGM Grand hotel-casino -- and arguably one of the most significant 
since Howard Hughes poured at least $100 million into the desert resort city in 
the mid-1960s, industry observer William N. Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Howard Hughes' investment was a big signal that gaming was a legitimate 
(business)," said Thompson, a professor at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. 
As analysts warned about overbuilding in Las Vegas and gaming stocks fell in 
value during the past year, the ITT announcement provided "a tremendous boost," 
Thompson said. "They are voting with their money that they have faith in 
gaming." 
</P>
<P>
 The merger would give Caesars World -- which has been criticized for falling 
behind rivals in expanding -- access to ITT's financial might and a link to the 
New York-based conglomerate's Sheraton hotel chain. Henry Gluck would remain as 
chairman and chief executive of Caesars World, and the company would remain 
headquartered in Century City under the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main goal is to continue to run the company . . . and then try to look 
for synergies and find a way to blend the best of what both companies have," 
said Gluck, who stands to make $33.5 million through the sale of his 490,055 
Caesar World shares. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, ITT would gain an immediate and sizable presence in the gambling 
business through Caesars World, which also owns hotel-casinos in Atlantic City 
and South Lake Tahoe, and a partial interest in a Canadian casino near Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Caesars acquisition, ITT said it would drop plans announced last year 
to build a $750-million casino resort -- the Desert Kingdom -- in Las Vegas on 
the property of the Sheraton Desert Inn, which ITT recently acquired. Buying an 
existing casino company became more attractive as gaming stock prices remained 
depressed and several other firms had proposed building new Las Vegas resorts, 
the company and analysts said. Several huge casino-hotels -- such as Luxor, 
Treasure Island and the MGM Grand -- have already opened in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 ITT did not disclose how it would develop the Sheraton Desert Inn property. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, ITT Chairman and President Rand V. Araskog called Gluck to propose 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Caesars is one of the great names in the gaming industry," Araskog said in a 
statement. "The acquisition helps ITT create one of the premier hospitality, 
gaming and entertainment companies in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the deal, ITT would pay $67.50 for each Caesars share, a bid high enough 
to be hard for potential rivals to match, industry analysts said. The deal must 
be approved by stockholders as well as gambling regulators in Nevada, New 
Jersey and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 ITT said it will finance the deal through the sale of its financial services 
division, which is expected to be completed by the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Caesars shares soared $20.625 to close at $65.875 on the New York 
Stock Exchange on volume of 7 million shares. Caesars stock had risen $2.625 on 
Friday. ITT shares eased 37.5 cents to $81.50 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Other gaming stocks also rose Monday. Circus Circus jumped $1.375 to $22.75, 
Mirage Resorts gained 50 cents to $20.125, Promus added 87.5 cents to $30.125, 
Showboat rose 50 cents to $13.25 and Players International surged $1.25 to 
$20.25. But Beverly Hills-based Hilton Hotels dropped $1.125 to $68.  
</P>
<P>
 Since it opened in 1968 as one of Las Vegas' first themed gambling resorts, 
Caesars Palace has been a mecca for high-rolling gamblers from around the 
world. In recent years, Caesars has added a glittering shopping mall and plans 
to build an entertainment complex featuring magic shows and shops.

A THAW IN GIVING; AFTER A THREE-YEAR FREEZE, PEOPLE ARE DONATING AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After three years of The Big Bah Humbug, Southern California charities are 
noticing signs of a thaw in the philanthropic deep-freeze brought about by the 
lingering recession. 
</P>
<P>
 More businesses are adopting schools or preparing holiday baskets or 
collecting toys and canned goods, nonprofit organizations say. And more 
individuals are donating money and time now that they are confident the economy 
is revving up again. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not exactly a visit from St. Nicholas yet: Most nonprofit charities are 
measuring increases in the single digits or are thankful that totals are no 
longer dropping. And some, particularly food banks, still face tough sledding. 
But for many, change is in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing a lot of lapsed donors who are coming back to the fold," said 
Mike Tomasello, development director for Catholic Charities, a $27.5-million 
human-services agency operated by the Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
 Catholic Charities is expecting an 8% to 10% increase in giving compared to 
last Christmas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This, not surprisingly, is the nonprofits' biggest fund-raising season as 
holiday goodwill coincides with the year-end rush to donate for tax reasons. 
But the take has been noticeably smaller in recent years, thanks to the dismal 
performance of the local economy. That Grinch now appears to be heading out of 
town, and consumers are responding not only by spending at the malls but by 
giving to their favorite causes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're any indication, then yes, things are better," said Karen McGlinn, 
executive director of Share Our Selves, a Costa Mesa-based social services 
agency. SOS has seen increased donations of food, money and time, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year we're having wonderful contributions from the private sector." 
</P>
<P>
 McGlinn tells of businesses where employees voted to forgo the annual 
Christmas party so that the money could go to SOS. Some companies that can't 
afford to write a check are hosting food drives, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope is also glimmering again at the Pacoima headquarters of Meet Every Need 
with Dignity, which discovered deficit spending during the recession. Donations 
were up slightly to fill 1,200 Christmas baskets with toys, food and blankets 
for needy families, and November brought in a few thousand dollars more than 
last year, said Executive Director Marianne Haver Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm feeling encouraged that we're ahead. It's just not enough," Hill said, 
noting that the nonprofit is still running a small deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District will record about 10% growth in its 
program to match businesses with schools, said Eiko Moriyama, coordinator of 
the nation's largest adopt-a-school project. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say, 'With the economy, your program really must be slowing down,' and 
I say, 'To the contrary,' " explained Moriyama. Even companies that are cutting 
back elsewhere are maintaining or even increasing their participation because 
they consider school funding to be "preventive medicine," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Less surprising, given strong growth in the national economy, charitable 
giving nationwide will probably will be up for 1994, said Ann Kaplan, research 
director for the American Assn. of Fund-Raising Counsel Inc., which each year 
measures how much was given to nonprofit groups. In 1993, charitable donations 
by individuals and corporations rose 3.6% but, adjusted for inflation, were 
virtually unchanged from the year before.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "If consumer confidence is up and spending is up and income is at least 
slightly better, then we should see an increase" in charitable giving, Kaplan 
said. "The question is to what degree and how the gifts will be distributed." 
</P>
<P>
 One type of human-service nonprofit that is having a difficult time is the 
food bank. These organizations, which distribute food to the needy, flourished 
in the 1980s but in the 1990s have had to compete with a growing for-profit 
market for the types of goods that food manufacturers used to donate. 
</P>
<P>
 Products that are dented, close to expiration or are in outdated packaging, 
for example, are increasingly being sold to a secondary market so that food 
companies can boost their bottom lines, food-bank managers say. As a result, 
many pantries have more clients than food. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our food program director is having to work a lot harder to get the same 
amount of food," said Hill of MEND. "She's constantly having to find new 
donors. She can't rely on the same donors to come back time and time again." 
</P>
<P>
 Other charitable causes are still having a tough time as well. The U.S. Marine 
Corps Reserve's Toys for Tots in Orange County may not reach its goal of 51,000 
toys for needy children, said Staff Sgt. Michael Diaz, coordinator for south 
Orange County.  
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe some people are waiting until the last minute, but that would be a 
shame," Diaz said. "There are some agencies that are not going to get their 
requests filled." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles businesswoman Beate Chelette is new to the world of philanthropy. 
After reading a Los Angeles Times series on hunger, Chelette decided not to buy 
gifts this year for the clients of her Melrose Avenue photo production agency, 
called Beate Works. Instead, she bought toys and is faxing her clients and 
urging them to do the same. The goal of this one-woman drive is to distribute 
250 toys, and Chelette said she is about a third of the way to her target. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody's in such great financial condition these days, but at least we eat. I 
looked at my child and I thought, 'This is something I can do,' " said 
Chelette, who has a 2-year-old daughter. "Whether I cover one day-care center 
or 10, that doesn't change the quality of my idea or our will to do what we can 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the recession never dulled the adopt-a-family program undertaken by 
the Metropolitan Transit Authority, St. Vibiana's Cathedral and the Downtown 
Los Angeles merchants who belong to Miracle on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Wednesday, Christmas was celebrated early at Clifton's Cafeteria on 
Broadway, just as it has been for the last five years. Santa was hauled to the 
popular eatery in a caravan of siren-blaring, traffic-stopping MTA police cars. 
Clifton's served turkey and all the trimmings to about 125 people, and 25 
families went home with toys and bags of food. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get more out of this than the kids do," said Robert Clinton, vice 
president of the family-owned cafeteria chain.

REPORT CRITICIZES BROKERS FOR COLD CALLING; INVESTING: HOUSE PANEL SAYS THE 
SECURITIES INDUSTRY ISN'T DOING A GOOD JOB OF COMPLYING WITH LAW GOVERNING 
BROKERS' SALES CALLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A report Monday by a House subcommittee gave the securities industry low marks 
for compliance with a 2-year-old federal law meant to curb nagging phone calls 
from stock brokers seeking new business. 
</P>
<P>
 The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 requires brokerage firms to 
maintain lists of people who do not wish to receive unsolicited "cold calls" 
from brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the staff report -- issued by Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), who until 
the end of the year remains chairman of the House subcommittee on 
telecommunications and finance -- gave the 50 biggest brokerage firms an 
overall grade of "C/C+" for their performance under the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a survey of the firms, the Markey report found that many made it 
extremely difficult for customers to get their names on "do-not-call" lists. It 
also faulted firms for failing to adequately train brokers about cold-calling 
rules and exploiting a loophole in the law by having non-brokers make many of 
the calls. 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony before Markey's subcommittee in September, Securities and 
Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. had said cold calling remained a 
major problem that risked damaging Wall Street's reputation. In recent years, 
cold calls have generated thousands of complaints from people repeatedly 
contacted at home and work. The subcommittee estimates that 75,000 stock 
brokers make 1.5 billion cold calls per year. 
</P>
<P>
 The subcommittee's staff said individual firms' do-not-call lists were not 
working well. The report also urged the Federal Communications Commission to 
again consider creating a centralized national database of people who do not 
want to receive such calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found that some firms do not put customers' names on do-not-call 
lists unless the customers use extremely specific language requesting it. For 
example, one firm's written policy, quoted in the report, told brokers not to 
add names to the list even when the person called told a broker to never call 
again. Rather, the policy said a name should be added to the list only if a 
person specifically requested being put on a do-not-call list or asked that no 
one at the firm ever call again. 
</P>
<P>
 The subcommittee did not name the firm in question, nor did it single out any 
of the 50 brokerages for individual criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 But the report concluded: "In the English language, 'Don't call me again!' 
means 'Don't call me again!' It is time that broker-dealers . . . understood 
this and ceased their linguistic shenanigans." 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the report found that brokerages had distributed written 
guidelines on cold calling to employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wall Street received low marks on complying with the law, it did 
slightly better than the telemarketing industry, which sells other goods and 
services over the phone and is covered by the same law. A subcommittee staff 
member said that industry had gotten marks in the "D" range in an earlier 
study.

DESPITE RECORD SALES, MATTEL SAYS IT WILL CUT 1,000 WORKERS; EARNINGS: TOY 
MAKER ALSO ANNOUNCES 5-FOR-4 STOCK SPLIT FOR SHAREHOLDERS AND CONTINUATION OF 
6-CENTS-PER SHARE DIVIDEND. 
</P>

<P>
 Toy maker Mattel Inc., winding up a robust holiday season that has propelled 
it toward a sixth consecutive year of record sales and earnings, announced 
plans Monday for a $70-million worldwide restructuring effort that will 
eliminate more than 1,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the record performance, a spokesman said the layoffs -- which will hit 
Mattel's 2,000-employee headquarters staff in El Segundo as well as its 
far-flung overseas operations -- are "in the best interests of the company." 
</P>
<P>
 The restructuring includes the consolidation of manufacturing operations and 
the reduction of headquarters expense and support functions at the world's 
largest toy manufacturer, which operates in 34 countries around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Also announced was a 5-for-4 stock split for shareholders and a continuation 
of its 6 cents-per-share dividend, making an effective 25% dividend increase to 
be paid in the second quarter of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattel said elimination of the 1,000 jobs -- nearly 5% of the Mattel's 
22,000-member worldwide work force -- is necessary in part to eliminate 
redundancies after its merger with Fisher-Price in late 1993 and the purchases 
of toy makers Kransco and J.W. Spear earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Toy analyst Laurie Lively Smith of the Seidler Companies in Los Angeles called 
the restructuring an "evolutionary process" in the wake of the acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mattel has been a very dynamic, pro-active company when it comes to looking 
for ways to enhance efficiency, particularly in manufacturing," said Lively 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 With the acquisitions, Mattel became the largest toy manufacturer in the 
world, with principal brands of Barbie, Fisher-Price, Walt Disney-licensed 
merchandise and Hot Wheels together accounting for 80% of its total sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "While corporate restructuring is often seen only during difficult times, this 
action comes as we anticipate reporting record results for the sixth 
consecutive year," said John W. Amerman, Mattel's chairman and chief executive. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The restructuring, according to Mattel spokesman Glenn Bozarth, will save the 
company approximately $25 million next year and more in the following years by 
consolidating manufacturing operations and reducing headquarter expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Although specific jobs to be eliminated will not be announced until January, 
Bozarth said the El Segundo headquarters operation will not escape the firings. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattel earned $1.17 a share in the first nine months and company officials 
anticipated meeting expectations of profit from operations for the fourth 
quarter with strong Christmas sales of mostly Barbie dolls and Lion King 
merchandise. However, the company will take a one-time charge against 
fourth-quarter earnings of $70 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock split will give shareholders one additional share of Mattel common 
stock for every four shares they hold as of Jan. 6. The board of directors 
plans to maintain its regular quarterly dividend of 6 cents a share on 
post-split shares, resulting in the equivalent of a 25% dividend increase. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement was made after close of trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange, where Mattel shares closed at $26.375, off 12.5 cents.

 Liz Claiborne to Shut Some Stores: The apparel maker said it will close its 
77-store First Issue retail chain, which includes stores in Costa Mesa, San 
Diego, Canoga Park, Santa Monica and Arcadia. First Issue stores sell women's 
casual and career clothes under the First Issue name, but the label failed to 
catch on, the firm said.The stores will be closed or converted to Liz 
Claiborne, Dana Buchman and Elisabeth stores. Executives didn't know how many 
stores will be converted or how many of the chain's 500 to 600 employees will 
lose their jobs. The New York-based company said it will take a pretax charge 
against earnings of $20 million to $30 million, cutting 16 cents to 24 cents 
from fourth-quarter net income.

BURLINGTON HAS INSIDE TRACK FOR SANTA FE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Burlington Northern Inc.'s $3.8 billion offer gives it an edge but no one is 
counting Union Pacific Corp. out of the escalating battle for Santa Fe Pacific 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never seen Union Pacific roll over in its history. I'd be surprised if 
they didn't respond," railroad analyst Michael Lloyd of NatWest Securities in 
New York said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Burlington and Santa Fe announced a new agreement worth $20 per 
Santa Fe share, or about $3.8 billion. The price topped Union Pacific's bid of 
$17.50 a share, or $3.3 billion. Burlington had previously offered about $17 a 
share, or $3.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific, the nation's largest railroad by revenue, was considering its 
options on Monday, spokesman Gary Schuster said.  
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Burlington's bid, with its higher price, was better for Santa Fe 
shareholders, who are scheduled to vote Jan. 27. The main drawback is that the 
cash-and-stock deal would not be consummated until the Interstate Commerce 
Commission approves the merger in mid-1996 or later. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific proposes giving Santa Fe shareholders their money up front and 
placing Santa Fe in a separate trust, which would run it while the ICC 
deliberates. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said that investors who want the money now would prefer a Union 
Pacific price equal to Burlington's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Union Pacific's offer at the same dollar price is always better than 
Burlington's offer," Mark Altherr of Salomon Brothers Inc. said. He also said 
Union Pacific can offer more cash than Burlington because it has a better 
credit rating and can borrow more. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Union Pacific may not even have to outbid Burlington to win 
Santa Fe, the seventh-largest U.S. railroad. It only has to bid enough to sway 
investors worried about waiting 18 months and the heavy debt Burlington would 
take on to complete the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 In afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Burlington was down $2 at 
$49.50 a share. cq/ptSanta Fe was up 62.5 cents at $17.50. cq/ptUnion Pacific 
was down 25 cents at $47.25. 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts agree with Santa Fe that a merger with Burlington is more likely 
to win ICC approval. But as time passes, Santa Fe stock is accumulating in the 
hands of profit-minded arbitragers likely to favor Union Pacific for its faster 
pay off, Altherr said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prize is domination of western U.S. rail service. Santa Fe's route from 
Chicago to Southern California is more direct than Union Pacific's. No. 2 
Burlington Northern, based in Fort Worth, Tex., has no such route.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW GIVES UP A BIT OF LAST WEEK'S GAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Profit-taking after last week's gains drove U.S. stocks lower Monday, while 
bonds and the dollar drifted ahead of the Federal Reserve Board's meeting 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa stock index plunged 96.48 points, or 4.2%, to a 
five-month low of 2,231.11 after peasant rebels in Chiapas launched troop 
movements that raised the threat of war in the troubled southern state. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow industrial average, which had gained 116 points last 
week, eased 16.49 points to 3,790.70. 
</P>
<P>
 Broader market measures also receded marginally, as losers outnumbered gainers 
by about 4 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Monday's trading was in part a snap-back from Friday's market 
surge, which was skewed by technical trading related to the quarterly 
expiration of key stock index option and futures contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 NYSE volume on Friday rocketed to 483 million shares, the third-busiest day 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from Friday's expiration-related gains, traders said many buyers had 
been motivated last week by belief that the Fed won't raise interest rates when 
it meets today. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic reports last week showing sustained growth with low inflation 
suggested that the central bank could put off tightening credit again. The Fed 
has raised short-term rates six times so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market Monday, yields closed mixed, though there was little 
movement either way. Shorter-term yields inched up while the 30-year Treasury 
bond yield slipped to a two-month low of 7.83%, versus 7.85% on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico, meanwhile, the Bolsa index's 4.2% plunge was its worse since it 
dropped 4.8% on Nov. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The selling began after after armed men, originally identified as Zapatista 
rebels, peacefully occupied several towns in the southeastern state of Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio Red reported that other gunmen, their faces covered with ski masks and 
kerchiefs, formed roadblocks with trees and boulders to isolate several towns. 
The highway between Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of Chiapas, and San Cristobal 
de las Casas, one of the largest cities in the state, was among the roads 
blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are very tense in Chiapas," said an analyst at Valmex International. 
"As long as the situation there is unresolved, there will be uncertainty" that 
will keep many investors from buying Mexican stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bolsa is down almost 14% since the Dec. 1 inauguration of President 
Ernesto Zedillo, in part because of concern that Zapatista National Liberation 
Army rebels would resume the fighting that killed nearly 150 people in 12 days 
of skirmishes last January. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Monday's U.S. market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Caesars World soared 20 5/8 to 65 7/8 after ITT agreed to buy the gaming 
company for 67 1/2 a share, or about $1.7 billion. ITT slipped 3/8 to 81 1/2. 
Other gaming stocks rising on the news included Circus Circus up 1 3/8 to 22 
3/4; Primadonna, up 1/2 to 23 1/4; Grand Casinos, up 3/4 to 14 1/8, and Aztar,

PHILIP MORRIS TO SELL KRAFT FOOD SERVICE; DIVESTING: A PRIVATE INVESTMENT FIRM 
WILL BUY THE INSTITUTIONAL DIVISION OF KRAFT GENERAL FOODS FOR $700 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tobacco, food and brewing giant Philip Morris Cos. agreed Monday to sell its 
Kraft Food Service Inc. division to private investment firm Clayton, Dubilier & 
Rice for about $700 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 With annual revenue of about $4 billion, Kraft Food Service distributes a wide 
range of food service products to restaurants, hospitals, public institutions 
and other non-retail outlets. It is a division of Philip Morris' Kraft General 
Foods Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a cash deal . . . it's in the neighborhood of $700 million," said 
Andrall Pearson, a principal in the investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton, Dubilier & Rice has also purchased subsidiaries from International 
Business Machines Corp., Colgate Palmolive Co., Xerox Corp. and BF Goodrich Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Kraft Food Service distributes more than 160,000 products manufactured by a 
wide variety of suppliers, including Kraft. 
</P>
<P>
 The distributor will remain based in Deerfield, Ill. It has 8,800 employees 
and operates through 42 distribution centers across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 By selling off Kraft Food Service, Philip Morris gets out of a low-margin 
business that was a drag on earnings, industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a business that hasn't been run terribly well over the years," 
Smith Barney analyst Ronald Morrow said. 
</P>
<P>
 No major effect on Philip Morris earnings is seen as the deal has been 
anticipated for some time, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been trying to sell this for at least a year," UBS Securities analyst 
Anton Brenner said. "It's a very low margin business. It's not a place they 
wanted to invest more capital. They're better off without it." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the agreement with CD&R, Kraft Food Service will remain the 
exclusive distributor of Kraft-brand food service products to most traditional 
institutional customers for five years, subject to terms of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks leading to the sale were announced in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The transaction is expected to be completed within the next several months, 
subject to regulatory approvals, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
 CD&R, founded in 1978, manages equity capital in excess of $1 billion. "This 
purchase will just about exhaust that," Pearson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton Dubilier said it specializes in acquiring divisions of large 
corporations and working with management to create more competitive enterprises 
and superior returns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't ever have an exit strategy," Pearson said. "All we try to do is 
double the profit in five years." 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris, manufacturer of Marlboro brand, is the largest U.S. cigarette 
company. It also is a major producer of snack food and beer through its Kraft 
General Foods and Miller Brewing Co. units. 
</P>
<P>
 Its stock fell $1 to $57.625 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.

BMW TO MAKE ENGINES FOR ROLLS-ROYCES; AUTOS: THE DEAL, A COUP OVER BMW RIVAL 
MERCEDES-BENZ, MARKS THE END OF AN ERA FOR ROLLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters

<TEXT>
<P>
 Germany's BMW trumped its arch-rival Mercedes-Benz Monday by signing a deal 
with Rolls-Royce Motor Cars that will put BMW engines in the world's most 
prestigious cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The coup over Mercedes marks the end of a high-profile year for BMW that began 
with its controversial acquisition of Britain's last British-owned high-volume 
car manufacturer, Rover Cars, from British Aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rolls-BMW deal marks the end of an era for Rolls-Royce, whose cars convey 
the rich and the royal the world over. It has been making its own engines since 
1904. 
</P>
<P>
 The link will save Vickers PLC, the engineering company that owns Rolls-Royce, 
the cost of developing new engines for badly needed revamps of the Rolls-Royce 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 The engines in current Rolls-Royce models have not been updated since the 
1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did of course fully exploit the competitive position (between the two 
German companies)," said Sir Colin Chandler, Vickers' chief executive. "We took 
it to the wire." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler said Vickers could afford to design a new car, but that BMW's 
expertise would help create a new engine that would be able to meet exacting 
new environmental standards, particularly in Rolls' key U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rover deal shocked Japanese car giant Honda, which had forged a 14-year 
relationship with Rover, lending its expertise and jointly developing two Rover 
lines. But it helped boost BMW's position, because Rover supplies body panels 
to Rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that we have worked together was a contributing factor," Chandler 
told a news conference. BMW also supplies air bags and air-conditioning systems 
to Rolls-Royce. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies made it clear that the deal did not involve any immediate change 
in ownership of Rolls-Royce. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler said an equity stake in Rolls-Royce was not currently an issue, but 
said he did not rule out anything in the long term. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rolls-BMW deal will also explore ways to develop the Concept Java car, a 
new high-performance Bentley coupe that has won praise from the automotive 
press. 
</P>
<P>
 BMW Chief Executive Bernd Pischetsrieder said that putting BMW engines in 
Rolls-Royces wouldn't dilute its strong brand or detract from its hand-crafted 
image. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is Rolls-Royce's and our opinion that another brand name must not appear 
in Rolls-Royce cars," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolls-Royce said the deal would eventually mean the end of engine-building at 
the company, but that the 350 to 400 workers specializing in that area would be 
retrained and redeployed in other parts of the company.

BEN & JERRY'S LATEST: RED INK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Price-conscious consumers have been deserting Ben & Jerry's ice cream for 
cheaper brands lately, prompting the company Monday to predict its first 
quarterly loss since it went public 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, known for the flamboyant founders who gave it its name, has 
suffered declining profits all year long and estimated its fourth-quarter loss 
at $700,000 to $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be the first red ink for Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc. since it first 
sold stock to the public in 1984. Ben & Jerry's spokesman Rob Michalak said the 
company still expects to turn a profit for the full year. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the bad news, the company also said Monday that recurring problems 
in a computerized handling system will force it to delay opening a new, more 
efficient manufacturing plant in St. Albans, Vt., until the middle of next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's shares dropped 15% Monday, falling $1.75 to $10 on the Nasdaq 
stock market. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben & Jerry's President Chuck Lacy said fourth-quarter revenues are expected 
to be between $30 million and $31 million. That's down from $31.7 million at 
the same time last year. Final results for the quarter are not expected until 
mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
 "While our earnings have been negatively impacted in 1994 by the 
inefficiencies in the company's production planning, purchasing and inventory 
management systems . . . the anticipated loss in the current quarter is due 
primarily to lower than expected sales levels," Lacy said in a written 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 An investment banker who has followed Ben & Jerry's for years was not 
surprised by Monday's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think they were taken by their own success," said Lewis H. Alton, managing 
general partner of L. H. Alton & Co. in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The exponential sales growth that Ben & Jerry's enjoyed for a number of years 
could not be sustained, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't really see much lack of success. We only see a lot of very good 
success -- success beyond which it could not compete," Alton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's earnings have been below expectations all year. In the first 
nine months of 1994, the profit was $3 million, just half what it earned the 
year before. 
</P>
<P>
 But up until the fourth quarter, sales had continued to climb, although at a 
somewhat slower rate than in recent years. Third-quarter sales were $44.8 
million, a 14% gain from the third quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben & Jerry's, which claims 42% of the market in the category of ice cream 
known as super premium, also has seen increasing competition from manufacturers 
of lower grades.

 T-Bill Rates Decline to Three-Week Low: The Treasury Department sold $13.1 
billion of new three-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.59%, down 
from 5.76% last week.Another $13.1 billion of new six-month bills was sold at 
an average discount rate of 6.30%, down from 6.32%. The three-month bill rate 
was the lowest since they sold for 5.44% on Nov. 28. The six-month bill rate 
was the lowest since they averaged 5.86% the same day. The new discount rates 
understate the actual return to investors -- 5.75% for three-month bills with a 
$10,000 bill selling for $9,858.70 and 6.60% for a six-month bill selling for

 Fremont to Buy Continental's Workers Comp Unit: Santa Monica-based Fremont 
General Corp. announced a definitive agreement to purchase Casualty Insurance 
Co., the Illinois-based workers compensation insurance unit of Continental 
Corp., for $250 million. The acquisition of Casualty -- with assets of $1 
billion and annual revenue of $400 million -- will double the size of Fremont's 
workers comp business and expand it into Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and 
Wisconsin, according to Wayne R. Bailey, Fremont's chief financial 
officer.Fremont currently writes workers compensation only in California and 
Arizona. Casualty has a 15% market share in Illinois, Bailey said. The 
350-employee company will continue to operate with its existing management and 
will report to Fremont's workers comp unit, Glendale-based Fremont Compensation 
Insurance Co. The proposed transaction is subject to regulatory approval and 
certain other conditions.

VIDEO GAME COMPANY 3DO MOVES TO CONSERVE CASH, ANALYSTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what appeared to presage a round of layoffs and other spending cutbacks, 
Redwood City-based 3DO Co. on Monday announced a corporate restructuring that 
includes plans to "streamline its organization" and "reduce expenses through 
the elimination of redundant positions." 
</P>
<P>
 The firm, which 15 months ago launched a souped-up video game player aimed at 
entrenching itself as a new consumer electronics standard, said it had sold 
500,000 of the machines thus far worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the move signaled the firm's desire to conserve cash and put off 
another public offering as its stock continues to drift downward. A planned 
offering was canceled earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they started out, they were going to be all things to all people," said 
Lee Isgur, an analyst at Jefferies & Co. "But they know they have to make it on 
their own from here on out, and the best way to do that is pursue their core 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 According to a news release, the firm will consolidate five departments -- 
including technology and product management -- under a newly appointed senior 
vice president of business operations, John A. Orcutt. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement added that "the company will reduce and postpone expenses in the 
development of vertical or niche markets." 
</P>
<P>
 At a price tag more than twice that of the popular 16-bit Sega and Nintendo 
game machines, 3DO got off to a slow start. Sales have been picking up, 
especially outside of the United States, but this year the firm's "multiplayer" 
will face new products from Sega and Sony Corp. that are likely to at least 
match its technology and may well undercut it in price. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls to the company for comment were not returned.

SHOPPING MALL MAGNATE DIES; DEVELOPMENT: EDWARD J. DEBARTOLO SR. PARLAYED A 
FAMILY REAL ESTATE BUSINESS INTO A VAST FORTUNE THAT INCLUDE 49ERS PRO FOOTBALL 
TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Edward J. DeBartolo Sr., who parlayed a family real estate business into a 
vast shopping center and development firm, died Monday. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
 DeBartolo died from complications of pneumonia, said a release from the Edward 
J. DeBartolo Corp. The statement did not say where he died. 
</P>
<P>
 DeBartolo, whose development prowess helped make the mall a modern American 
icon, was one of the country's richest businessmen. His family's holdings also 
included the San Francisco 49ers football team. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, however, the value of DeBartolo's real estate holdings began 
to erode, and he was forced to sell some holdings -- including the Pittsburgh 
Penguins of the National Hockey League -- to raise cash. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, the company launched a real estate investment trust and announced 
a program to spruce up more than 30 of its properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Anthony Paonessa in Youngstown on May 17, 1909, DeBartolo took his 
stepfather's name while in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 The young DeBartolo began working with his stepfather, Michael, at age 13, 
writing bids for construction projects ranging from road work to commercial 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 While a student in civil engineering at the University of Notre Dame in South 
Bend, Ind., DeBartolo worked as a foreman on building projects in the area. 
After graduating in 1932, he returned to work for his stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1937, DeBartolo went into business for himself, building single-family 
residences in his hometown. He served in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
during World War II and saw his chances for success in the postwar baby boom 
and the development of suburbia. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s, DeBartolo's business began to focus on the development of 
shopping malls. Other interests included office towers, suburban office parks, 
hotels, horse-racing tracks, supermarkets and condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1980s saw an extended real estate slump, and the company struggled with $4 
billion in debt, a weight that threatened DeBartolo's personal fortune as well 
as his business interests. 
</P>
<P>
 DeBartolo's love of sport was well known. He served as president of three 
horse-racing tracks -- Louisiana Downs in Bossier City, La., Thistledown in 
Cleveland and Remington Park in Oklahoma City -- and his business had begun to 
invest in riverboat gambling, opening a floating casino near Louisiana Downs 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 DeBartolo is survived by his son, Edward Jr., who runs the 49ers and serves as 
chairman of the board for DeBartolo Realty Corp.; a daughter, Marie, and seven 
grandchildren. His wife, Marie, died in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 A private funeral service is planned.

 Citing an improved California economy, Saks Fifth Avenue said Monday it will 
acquire four of the seven available I. Magnin store sites from R. H. Macy & 
Co., including stores in Beverly Hills and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "California is a vibrant marketplace now," said Saks Chairman Philip 
Miller."Regions go through economic cycles, but California will be a premier 
marketplace for the foreseeable future and we want a greater presence." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Southern California stores, Saks is acquiring I. Magnin 
sites in Carmel and Phoenix. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 The status of some I. Magnin sites has been uncertain since Macy's Nov. 18 
announcement that the 12-store chain would be phased out. Earlier this month, 
Macy said it would convert five of the I. Magnin stores into Bullock's or Macy 
stores and place the remaining seven on the sales block. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy said it reached agreement with Saks shortly before Macy's acquisition by 
Federated Department Stores became official Monday under a merger agreement 
approved by both companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The upscale Saks chain, based in New York, already has stores in Costa Mesa, 
Palm Springs, Carmel and Beverly Hills. The Carmel and Beverly Hills stores 
will be augmented by the former I. Magnin sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The I. Magnin store in Beverly Hills is at 9634 Wilshire Blvd., near the 
existing Saks store at 9600 Wilshire. The I. Magnin store will be converted to 
a Saks by next August. The two Beverly Hills sites will be operated by the same 
management team.

THE BIZ / JAMES BATES: 'STREET FIGHTER' MOVIE BATTLES SKEPTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the upcoming Universal Pictures release "Street Fighter," Jean-Claude Van 
Damme as Col. William F. Guile battles to save hostages from warlord Gen. M. 
Bison, played by the late Raul Julia. 
</P>
<P>
 In real life, Japanese video game maker Capcom, which created the popular game 
on which "Street Fighter" is based, is battling Hollywood skeptics. The issue: 
Why would the company risk bankrolling by itself a movie costing nearly $40 
million that is based on a video game? 
</P>
<P>
 Capcom's eagerness to finance "Street Fighter" itself has raised eyebrows in 
Hollywood, where avoiding risk to get a film made by using other people's money 
is an art form. 
</P>
<P>
 The company could have simply licensed the use of its characters, pocketed a 
fee and sat back to wait for the screening invitations to come in the mail. And 
with the increasingly popular Van Damme as the film's star, getting a studio to 
go in as partner would have been relatively easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should have let someone else take some of the risk," said one industry 
deal maker. "It's not dumb to try to make a movie out of this. But I don't 
understand for a second why they would want to take all of the risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Exacerbating the doubts is the conventional wisdom that popular video games 
don't translate into successful movies. Last year, the Disney release "Super 
Mario Bros." proved a dud. "Double Dragon" disappeared faster than a karate 
kick when it opened in theaters last month. Adding to the stigma is the belief 
that most video games inherently lack a story, outside of kicking, punching and 
tossing things at wave after wave of bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Movies made based on successful video games don't work. There has never been 
a video game that works as a movie. What makes a good video game is the play 
ability, what makes a good movie is the story," said one prominent producer, 
echoing the prevailing sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Pressman, who produced the film and whose previous credits include such 
pictures as "Wall Street," "Reversal of Fortune" and "The Crow," counters with 
a simple explanation on why previous tries to turn video games into films 
failed. "They were bad movies," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Steven de Souza adds that only two previous tries doesn't prove 
anything. "Forrest Gump has more wisdom than this conventional wisdom. 
Generalizing when there's been only two attempts at something would get you 
kicked out of junior high science class," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes "Street Fighter" different is the financial commitment by Capcom, 
which wanted to make the movie to give an added boost to its highly successful 
arcade and home video game series. The original goal was a small $15-million 
film, a budget that grew with the hiring of Van Damme, who reportedly will get 
$8 million. The decision was made before Van Damme's "Timecop" opened to strong 
business this past summer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, the plan was for Capcom to finance only half of the film, with 
the other part financed through the sale of various overseas rights. But 
Pressman argued that the company stood to make a much bigger amount of money if 
the film is a hit if it continued to finance the whole thing itself. He also 
notes that Van Damme's movies typically do well in foreign markets and on video 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressman also says Capcom enjoys a much more lucrative deal on merchandise 
than it would have if a studio had gotten involved. If the movie only does the 
same domestic theatrical business "Super Mario" did -- barely north of $20 
million -- Capcom will still make out all right from the various revenue 
streams, he contends. 
</P>
<P>
 Jun Aida, the film's executive producer and director of licensing for Capcom 
USA's Sunnyvale office, adds that Capcom wanted to make sure the film's 
ultra-tight schedule was met so the movie would be released during this current 
holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the movie aims at a broad audience, it's no secret to Capcom that the 
primary fans of its video game are youths who play it regularly in arcades and 
doughnut shops and who will be out of school. The film also is Van Damme's 
first PG-13 film, which Capcom hopes will attract a younger audience that 
didn't see Van Damme's earlier R-rated action films. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst scenario is that we could have been in gridlock. If we wanted to be 
making a decision quickly, we didn't want to be chasing a financial partner who 
might have been out of town," Aida said. 
</P>

 Where's Bill? The most watched person in Hollywood these days doesn't seem to 
be Tim Allen or Jim Carrey, but rather Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last week, Hollywood was buzzing with the news that the 39-year-old 
Gates, whose net worth is almost $10 billion, actually had dinner here with 
executives of Pacific Telesis, Bell Atlantic and Nynex. Creative Artists 
Agency, which is working with the companies to develop programming and 
technology, arranged it. 
</P>
<P>
 One source downplayed the implications, suggesting that by the time Gates 
turns 40 he'll probably have met with every telecommunications executive who 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, this is a guy with a wallet so large he could buy Sony Pictures 
and MGM and still have enough left over to personally bail out Orange County.

 Music: Bertelsmann Music Group plans to discontinue its joint venture with 
Imago Recording Co. as of Jan. 1, BMG Entertainment Chairman Michael Dornemann 
confirmed. Sources said the venture never really took off, and that sales had 
been disappointing.Imago founder Terry Ellis in a news release said that the 
5-year-old label, which has such artists as singer-poet Henry Rollins, Aimee 
Mann, Love Spit Love and Paula Cole, will continue operating. The announcement 
comes as BMG in a separate move is said to be planning a new label with former 
A&M Records executive Jim Guerinot that will be financed through BMG's Arista 
Records unit.

 Film: Savoy Pictures said it boosted its stockholder equity by an additional 
$28 million from investors taking advantage of an offer to convert their bonds 
into stock at $10 a share instead of the original $18.60 conversion price. Last 
month, Savoy announced it would swap $40 million in bonds held by four 
institutional investors for common stock and make the same offer to holders of 
an additional $65 million in bonds. JAMES BATES

GROCERY WORKERS UNION SUES O.C. REGISTER OVER AD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A grocery workers union in Buena Park has filed a lawsuit against the owner of 
the Orange County Register, accusing the newspaper of breaching a contract by 
pulling an ad critical of Super Kmart. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 324 alleges in its suit, 
filed late Friday in Orange County Superior Court, that the Register canceled 
an agreement to run the union's ad this month in two of the newspaper's 
community weeklies, La Habra Star and Anaheim Hills News. The suit was filed 
against Irvine-based Freedom Communications Inc., the Register's parent 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 The union placed the ad as part of its campaign against Orange County's two 
new non-union Super Kmart stores, which sell more food items than regular 
Kmarts do. The full-page ad depicts several people waiting in line and makes 
several statements under a title that reads: "Super Kmart means Super Hassle!" 
</P>
<P>
 The ad appeared twice in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Redfern, senior vice president of advertiser marketing at the Register, 
said the newspaper pulled the ad because it was disparaging to another 
business, its statements could not be verified, and the ad did not identify its 
origin. "In an advocacy ad, we always require the identity of the ad placer," 
he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Redfern acknowledged that the ad ran twice in November, but he said that was 
because its content was not properly screened: "It didn't get the review it 
should have." 
</P>
<P>
 Union spokesman Rick Eiden said Monday that the Register notified the union 
Dec. 1 that the ad would not run that day or anymore because it was considered 
"offensive" by newspaper management. Eiden contended that the newspaper had 
been pressured by Kmart Corp. to stop the union's ad. 
</P>
<P>
 In its suit, the union is asking for damages in excess of $25,000 plus an 
order to prevent the Register from refusing the union's ad. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the union and other labor coalitions rallied at the grand opening 
of the Super Kmart in La Habra, saying that the big merchandise and supermarket 
center was paying substandard wages and would put other store owners out of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Redfern said Kmart had nothing to do with the decision to pull the ad, which 
the union paid $3,176.42 to run four times in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Teri Kula, a spokeswoman for Kmart at its headquarters in Troy, Mich., said 
Monday that she was unaware of the lawsuit. However, she said, "it certainly 
would not be our policy to restrict any advertisement."

DAVSTAR TO BUY MINNEAPOLIS COMPANY; ACQUISITION: COSTA MESA MAKER OF MEDICAL 
PRODUCTS SAYS IT WILL PAY $12.4 MILLION IN NEW SHARES OF STOCK FOR PRIVATELY 
HELD DACOMED. 
</P>

<P>
 Davstar Industries Ltd. said Monday that it will buy a Minneapolis-based 
medical-products company in a transaction valued at $12.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Dacomed Corp., a privately held company that makes urological products, had 
revenue of about $9 million for its latest fiscal year. Davstar, which designs 
and manufactures disposable medical products for hospitals, nursing homes and 
home health care, has annual revenue of about $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael A. Piraino, Davstar's executive vice president, said Dacomed agreed to 
a sale in exchange for new shares of Davstar's common stock so it can benefit 
from Davstar's experience as a publicly traded company. "We bring the 
management team, and they get access to capital," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined companies, Piraino said, will operate under a new name, yet to be 
chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 Davstar, based in Costa Mesa, has about 150 employees, and Dacomed has about 
75. Piraino said that the new company's work force "will be less than the two 
combined," but that executives have not yet decided where cuts will be made. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would expect their facility in Minneapolis will be restructured in some 
fashion," he said. "More than likely some of the administrative duties and 
(manufacturing) tasks will move out here, and that facility will be more 
technical," he said, focusing more on research and development. 
</P>
<P>
 Davstar's president and chief executive, Charles A. Laverty, will be chairman 
and chief executive of the new company. Dr. Gerald W. Timm, founder and 
principal shareholder of Dacomed, will be vice chairman and executive vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Piraino will become the chief operating officer, and Kevin Davidson, now vice 
president for finance at Dacomed, will be vice president of the new entity. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal is subject to approval by Davstar stockholders. Piraino said he does 
not expect it to be completed before the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
 Davstar's stock was unchanged at $2.38 a share in Monday's trading on the 
American Stock Exchange.

ABBEY HEALTHCARE LAYS OUT MANAGEMENT FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Abbey Healthcare Corp. on Monday tried to quell speculation that sparked a 
7.4% drop in its stock price on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Abbey asked Jerilyn Asher to step down as president, then withdrew 
the request a day later.A company spokesman said Asher flew to Denver on Friday 
to meet with Timothy Aitken, Abbey's chief executive officer, to resolve the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Abbey's stock fell Friday as speculation swirled in the marketplace 
that the management troubles could lead to larger problems at the home 
health-care company. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement Monday, Abbey said Asher will leave the company in the first 
half of next year to start a new business. Asher disagreed with Abbey's board 
on the company's "strategic direction and certain operational issues," the 
statement said. Abbey and Asher will continue to work together on her new 
venture, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Asher leaves, Aitken will resume the duties of president, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Asher described as unfounded a report last week that she had unearthed 
irregularities in the company's accounting. 
</P>
<P>
 In Monday's Nasdaq trading, Abbey's stock recovered $1 a share to close at 
$22. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest turmoil in Abbey's management follows the February firing of Victor 
Chaltiel, who served as president and chief executive. Chaltiel formerly was 
head of Total Pharmaceutical Care Inc., which Abbey acquired in November, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaltiel has filed a lawsuit against Abbey alleging that he was dismissed 
without cause.

HIGH-TECHNOLOGY VETERAN TO LEAD PICK SYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT: LONGTIME EXECUTIVE 
GEORGE OLENIK WILL GUIDE COMPUTER SOFTWARE COMPANY WHOSE FOUNDER, RICHARD PICK, 
DIED IN OCTOBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A longtime high-technology industry executive has been appointed chief 
executive of Pick Systems Inc., the computer database system and software maker 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 George E. Olenik, 62, most recently was a high-tech industry investment 
consultant for Inco Venture Capital Management, a New York firm that provides 
start-up and growth capital for a variety of businesses. As chief executive of 
Irvine-based Pick Systems, Olenik will be responsible for guiding a company 
whose founder, industry pioneer Richard A. Pick, died Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Olenik said Monday that his "immediate objective" is to let customers know 
that Pick Systems, despite its founder's death, is "very much active . . . 
(and) competitive." He said he does not think the company has faltered because 
of Pick's illness and death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you have a company that was run for 25 years by an entrepreneur, 
people perceive that with the entrepreneur's death the company will go away," 
Olenik said. "That is not the case here." 
</P>
<P>
 Olenik has a long association with Pick Systems: From 1970 to 1980 he was 
senior vice president of Microdata Corp. and was instrumental in negotiating 
that landmark Orange County technology firm's rights to market the operating 
system developed by Richard Pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Microdata Corp. was started in Newport Beach in the early 1960s and became one 
of the region's preeminent business computer system makers. It was acquired in 
1979 by McDonnell Douglas Co. and became part of the core of the giant 
aerospace company's Irvine-based information systems division. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pick system is a so-called open architecture system that is compatible 
with most types of computers and software. It is a specialized system that is 
used for development of complicated business software and for operating many 
types of business computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately owned Pick Systems says its products are installed on 250,000 
computer systems and used by 3 million people worldwide. The company, which has 
about 120 employees, does not release revenue and profit figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Olenik's career spans more than 30 years in the high-technology industry, 
centering on the computer business and specializing in marketing, finance, 
engineering and operations management. 
</P>
<P>
 A Newport Beach resident, he also has served as president and director of 
Micro Five Corp. of Costa Mesa, as a vice president at Nova-Tech Inc. in Los 
Angeles and as director of operations at Redcor Corp. of Canoga Park.

 Art of the Kingdom: A couple who met, became engaged, and married at 
Disneyland have co-authored a photo book showing where to find various 
painting, carving, sculptures and other artifacts at the Magic Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where in Disneyland Park" by Scott and Shani Wolf is being sold at Disney 
Stores, Disneyland and the new Walt Disney Gallery at MainPlace/Santa Ana.It 
retails for $9.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Wolf, a onetime assistant producer of computer games for Disney Consumer 
Products in Burbank, met his future wife while she worked as a clerk at the 
Watch Shop on Main Street at Disneyland. They got married at the Disneyland 
Hotel exactly a year after their first date. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple said they got the idea for the book from noticing how many 
beautiful artworks there are inside the park. For instance, it shows a plaque 
engraved with a skull in New Orleans Square and a decorative peacock drawing at 
the Aladdin's Oasis dinner theater. The book's foreword was written by former 
Disneyland President Jack Lindquist.

SEASON BRINGS A FEAST OF GOURMET FOOD GIFTS; MARKETING: MAIL-ORDER RETAILERS OF 
HIGH-PRICED SPECIALTY ITEMS SUCH AS CAVIAR, RELISHES AND PRE-SLICED HAM REPORT 
A BOOM IN SALES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Move over cheddar cheese and summer sausage, make room under the Christmas 
tree for caviar and filet mignon. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans are giving gourmet gifts for Christmas each year as the number of 
retailers selling high-priced specialty food booms. 
</P>
<P>
 Even discounters such as Melville Corp.'s Marshall's and Wal-Mart Stores 
Inc.'s Sam's Club are clearing floor space and sending out catalogues to cater 
to the rising demand for wholesome and exotic foods this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend does not point to a return to the days of power-eating in the '80s, 
experts said. Americans actually remain rather thrifty despite this year's 
healthier economy and strong job growth. 
</P>
<P>
 If consumers are pampering themselves these days, they're doing it in the 
kitchen, dining room or TV room. The explosion of home buying -- spurred by low 
interest rates -- has many shoppers focused on the nest, and giving gifts to be 
enjoyed at home is very popular this Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can get somebody a really wonderful collection of fruit preserves or 
relishes, and they're never the wrong size or the wrong color," said Justin 
Rashid, founder of Petoskey, Mich.,-based American Spoon Foods Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 American Spoon Foods, a retailer and catalogue marketer, is just one of the 
many home-grown food companies feeding off the gourmet gift trend. Its 
products, from jellies, gourmet mushrooms, hearty soups and relishes, are 
mostly made with edibles grown in Northern Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which Rashid started 12 years ago with New York chef and 
restaurant owner Larry Forgione, had its busiest day ever at its catalogue 
operation one day this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Food gifts) are very, very in and have grown to become a huge business," 
said Edward Loeb, publisher of Gourmet Retailer. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the growth stems from the spreading availability of gourmet foods and 
the earthy marketing twists that many producers attach to their products. 
</P>
<P>
 These gourmet newcomers are striking the same nesting chord in busy Americans 
that home decorating and culinary guru Martha Stewart touched several years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Food gifts also have a warmer, more personal touch than a silk tie, and they 
don't cost as much. "Food is something everyone has in common," Rashid said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of gourmet foods climbed to about $29.4 billion in 1993 from $22.0 
billion in 1989, according to the National Association for Specialty Food 
Trade. About 80% of that comes from grocery store sales and the rest from 
specialty food retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 But now even apparel retailers, hit by weak demand for clothes and shrinking 
profit margins on other merchandise, are boosting sales by offering prepackaged 
gift baskets, caviar, champagne, fish pate and olive oil this season. 
</P>
<P>
 These stores are setting up food sections "just like they might have a luggage 
area," Loeb said. 
</P>
<P>
 A $100 gift basket might brim with just $68 worth of gourmet delights, he 
said. The rest goes to small material costs, such as wrapping, and to profit. 
</P>
<P>
 At T.J. Maxx on State Street near Chicago's downtown business district, 
shoppers investigated a tall, metal food rack in the holiday gift area one 
recent week day. 
</P>
<P>
 Picking through the Ghirardelli's chocolate tins for $14.99, boxed smoked 
salmon fillets for $7.99 and pistachio nut packages for $12.99 was a 
Northwestern University professor in search of gifts for work associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Picking three boxes of chocolates, he said, "It's not Godiva, but the quality 
still seems pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 Discounters such as T.J. Maxx are challenging the mom-and-pop gourmet gift 
shops, some of which ring up roughly half their annual sales during the 
Christmas season, in part by selling gift baskets to corporate and individual 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wal-Mart plunged into the mail-order business this year with its "Gift 
Express" from its Sam's Club division. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35-page book features traditional pre-sliced, smoked ham for $29.99, 
1.75-ounce jars of beluga caviar for $89.99 and a big variety of food gift 
baskets for up to $99.99. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're selling things for even less than we can buy them for," said Lisa 
Fishwild, general manager of Spoonful gourmet food shop in a posh Lincoln Park 
neighborhood on Chicago's North Side. 
</P>
<P>
 While sales have increased each year at Richmond, Va.,-based Butler's Pantry, 
competition also is up. 
</P>
<P>
 To compete, the fancy food store offers hard-to-find items such as Louis 
Roederer Crystal champagne for $135 in addition to the $90 bottle of Dom 
Perignon, said manager Jim Morris.

BUSINESSES NOT READY TO GIVE UP ON FACE-TO-FACE MEETINGS YET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American businesses aren't ready to give up the old-fashioned business 
meeting, with little chance that face-to-face contact will be replaced by 
teleconferencing in the next decade, a survey released Friday said. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at 85 firms, with combined annual sales of more than $580 billion, 
said in the survey there was just a 41% likelihood teleconferencing would 
replace half of corporate travel requiring face-to-face contact by 2004. 
</P>
<P>
 They also said there is only a 44% likelihood firms would market their 
products directly to customers without use of wholesalers, distributors and 
retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the information superhighway, it doesn't appear that companies are 
ready to give up traditional distribution channels," said Ira Smolowitz, dean 
of the Bureau of Business Research and Program Development at American 
International College. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic communications will however move in on the U.S. mail. The 
executives said there is a 64% likelihood electronic mail, or e-mail, will 
replace at least half of all corporate first-class mail. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were the Postal Service, I'd be concerned," Smolowitz said from the 
college in Springfield, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, which involved chief executives from Forbes 500 companies, also 
indicated most firms will adopt so-called employee empowerment programs to 
allow for decision-making close to the customer. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was a 67% likelihood that consensus building training techniques, so 
popular in recent years, such as group mountain climbing, will be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "This shows that management is not really ready to give up the reins and the 
worker is not ready to take the responsibility -- for the errors as well," 
Smolowitz said.  
</P>
<P>
 There is a 58% chance most firms will need to provide on- or off-site training 
for entry-level employees by 2004, perhaps reflecting dissatisfaction with 
public education, the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Informality also may become a thing of the past. The executives said there was 
only a 53% chance of letting management "dress down" on any day of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Firms in the next decade are likely to rely more on strategic alliances with 
vendors, foreign corporations and governments, and there was a 71% likelihood 
most firms would form a strategic alliance with another organization, it said.

AIR-TO-GROUND TELEPHONE PIONEER SETS SIGHT ON NEW FIELD; COMMUNICATIONS: JOHN 
D. GOEKEN, WHOSE 1960S MICROWAVE TOWERS ENABLED MCI TO TAKE ON AT&T, PLANS A 
NATIONAL WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY COMPANY TO SUPPORT NEW LOCAL PHONE FRANCHISES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLIFF EDWARDS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John D. Goeken's head has always been up in the clouds, a trait for which many 
air travelers can give thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Goeken is widely viewed as the father of air-to-ground telephone 
communication. As a founder of MCI and Airfone Inc., he sought to make 
communication possible anywhere people go -- an idea that has revolutionized 
the telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
 He's also won a reputation as "Jack the Giant Killer," because of the fervor 
he's had in busting up communications monopolies. 
</P>
<P>
 But now Goeken's moving on. He announced last month that he's resigning as 
chairman and CEO of his latest enterprise, In-Flight Phone Corp., to establish 
a company that provides competitive local phone service. It's a task that comes 
as regional phone companies begin to open their markets to competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Goeken, 64, with large brown eyes and a welcoming smile, comes across as the 
friendly neighbor we'd all like to have. But those eyes can narrow and reveal 
the fighter who will dig his teeth into any new challenge and won't let go. 
</P>
<P>
 "You do it because it's something you believe in," Goeken said recently. 
"Everybody comes in and says you can't do something, so I do it just to prove 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He defied convention and was one of the founders of Microwave Communications 
Inc. in 1963, setting up a system of microwave towers to provide long-distance 
service between Chicago and St. Louis to compete with American Telephone & 
Telegraph Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The company went on to become MCI Communications Corp., the nation's 
second-largest long-distance telephone provider after AT&T. He left MCI in 1974 
and two years later founded Airfone Inc., the first air-to-ground telephone 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a natural move, blending his love of flying with his experience in 
telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes your mind off everything to get up there," said Goeken, who has 
14,000 flight hours in his Cessna. "But you look around and see that the 
airline was the last place for people to make phone calls, and the idea just 
comes right up." 
</P>
<P>
 Goeken won a monopoly for Airfone by obtaining the first radio license for 
airplane phone service from the Federal Communications Commission in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 He sold Airfone to GTE Corp. in 1986, but quit three years later in a power 
struggle. He sued GTE over a right to launch a competing business and won $15.5 
million. He also successfully petitioned the FCC to break Airfone's monopoly by 
forcing it to share frequencies with competitors, winning the right to take on 
his own brainchild. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jack's always hated monopolies, unless they were his own," said his daughter, 
Sandra Goeken Martis, who is chief executive of In-Flight's international 
division. "He's a street fighter who uses innovation as his weapon." 
</P>
<P>
 Innovation is what Oak Brook Terrace, Ill.-based In-Flight Phone used against 
GTE, employing digital transmission in its ground-to-air service for clearer 
conversations and more reliability in transmitting facsimiles and data files 
from laptop computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The In-Flight phones also featured computer screens designed to allow 
passengers to play computer games and tap into information services. 
</P>
<P>
 In-Flight currently is the third-largest provider of air-to-ground behind GTE 
and McCaw Cellular Communications, and MCI believes it will be a big winner. In 
June, it invested $20 million in the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Goeken's restless nature has once more sent him down a different path. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's only opportunities out there," he said. "Just to sit there and run a 
business -- you can hire people to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 He hopes to form a national wireless technology company providing expertise 
and equipment for individuals who want to set up local phone franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to provide lower prices and better service" than existing local 
phone companies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Telecommunications analyst Richard Klugman of PaineWebber Inc., in New York, 
says Goeken is still a valuable commodity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy certainly knows a lot about the telecom industry, there's no doubt 
about that," Klugman said. "Certainly, the guy's got experience, and there's a 
lot of people out there who want somebody who has that experience at busting 
monopolies." 
</P>
<P>
 Goeken started out fixing radios and television by trial and error as a senior 
high school student in Joliet, a Chicago suburb. He continued his education in 
the Army Signal Corps in the early 1950s but has no college training in 
electronics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd probably flunk the college entrance test if I tried to get in," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
 His daughter said his lack of formal training has helped him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That enables his mind in some regards to be set free, and because he see no 
boundaries . . . he'll come up with the most creative way, the most efficient 
way of doing something," Goeken Martis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goeken and his wife, Mona Lisa, have been married since they graduated from 
high school. They also have a 34-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 But Goeken Martis says her father was no typical parent. She recalls on her 
wedding day how he sat in the back of the limousine discussing business and how 
he sent her to conferences during her honeymoon in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always willing to give that much blood to the business. He expects it of 
me, he expects it of others," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if his new venture is a success, Goeken already has set his sights on 
another goal: forming a medical technology company to help stop human 
suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I get it from my father, a minister," he said. "I really want to do 
something to help people. You see people die who shouldn't die and you look 
around now and see all the technology in hospitals and know that's the way to 
go." 
</P>
<P>
 He says there's no time to waste. 
</P>
<P>
 "At 64, you ain't got much time to waste," he says. "You've got to move."

SURVEY FINDS WOMEN LACK CONFIDENCE IN PURCHASING STOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Butterflies in the stomach are common the minute anyone has to sign on the 
dotted line and face a future of monthly mortgage payments and household bills. 
But women appear far more confident buying a home -- often valued at hundreds 
of thousands of dollars -- than they are buying stocks or bonds, which are 
often valued at far less. 
</P>
<P>
 Women appear to be more confident coping with traditional financial 
transactions such as negotiating for a home or buying insurance. But when it 
comes to tackling investment transactions like the purchase of stocks or 
certificates of deposit, forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a survey by Self magazine, only 19% of women said they were 
confident buying stocks, CDs and bonds. The magazine reported 26% said they 
lacked confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it came to a home, plunking down thousands and committing to a 
30-year mortgage, 36% said they were confident. And 34% said they were 
confident about buying insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For many women, making major purchases and managing money are becoming a 
regular part of life. While women are more confident buying durable goods, a 
lot of this confidence comes from research. Nearly 60% of women said they 
"never buy an expensive product without asking other people about the product, 
reading up on it or getting information from the manufacturer." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts who track consumer attitudes say that women, despite ever-evolving 
attitudes, education and training, still generally have major problems when 
dealing with the purchase of "intangibles," such as stocks, bonds or mutual 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Tangibles are what you can see and feel, such as a house, car or other 
big-ticket item. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for this problem with intangibles is that women have generally not 
been raised to take care of financial needs, said Judith Langer of Langer 
Associates, a trend consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women are more risk averse," she said. "How deep this goes into our 
psychology, no one knows." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that "women have been trained somehow to play it safe, to take care 
of what we have. Women think they need a lot of money to get started," Langer 
said, which shows a lack of understanding of money matters. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the women, with whom Langer spoke in focus groups related to the 
Self study, said they expected sales personnel to treat them poorly, as if they 
were not uneducated, but unintelligent. This, especially when dealing with 
intangibles, made major purchases difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barton Weitz of the University of Florida says a lack of confidence buying 
intangibles does not apply just to women. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general, it's not an issue totally related to women. Both (genders) have 
less confidence evaluating intangible objects," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Weitz, chairman of the marketing department at the Gainesville, Fla., 
campus, said women may be "more unfamiliar with making these types of decisions 
-- a lack of experience." But he expects this to change over time. 
</P>
<P>
 Education is the key to increasing women's confidence in making "left brain" 
-- artistic or creative -- decisions, experts agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that once someone has knowledge, confidence rises and 
they will take a risk," said Frank Viggiano, professor in the department of 
consumer affairs, human development and environmental studies at Indiana 
University of Pennsylvania.  
</P>
<P>
 But without knowledge, women will postpone the purchase or buy something they 
know they can return. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can do all the ads you want, be visible, gain attention . . . but if 
there's no knowledge, (women) will postpone a purchase or will buy and return 
it -- just to acquire it and then do research after. Then they say, 'Oh my 
goodness, I didn't buy the right thing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Pick up a financial magazine, or ask advice of someone you respect, Viggiano 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get the vocabulary together and after you feel competent, wander into a store 
and ask questions . . . ask around, read more." 
</P>
<P>
 He also suggests that women analyze what their personal needs are and list the 
benefits and features of a particular item, tangible or intangible. 
</P>
<P>
 At the root of problems with major purchases, Viggiano said, is that "we talk 
about consumerism, but we don't teach it. We're bombarded with ads but not with 
educational material," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is particularly problematic for women, who according to his research feel 
they need to know twice what men feel they need to know in order to make a 
satisfactory purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 While Langer found that there were few generational differences among women 
and their attitudes toward major purchases, she did find that women in their 
20s and 30s had more financial training in school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some were every bit as savvy as men, but were a very distinct minority," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Langer agreed that women's attitudes are changing, "We have a problem of 
playing catch-up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Self survey of 1,376 women 18 to 49, conducted by Willard and 
Shullman Inc., 89% of the women personally own car insurance, 81% have savings 
accounts and 77% have life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 But only 5% personally own Treasury bills, 37% have stocks and 31% have a 
mutual fund.

ROPAK CORP. EXTENDS STANDSTILL AGREEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ropak Corp. said Monday that a special committee of its independent directors 
has agreed to extend an existing standstill agreement with Linpac Mouldings 
Ltd. of Birmingham, England. 
</P>
<P>
 Ropak said in a news release that Linpac has agreed not to acquire additional 
shares of Ropak capital stock through today. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-member committee earlier this month rejected as inadequate a 
$53-million bid by Linpac for Fullerton-based Ropak, a maker of plastic 
shipping containers. Linpac already owns about 45% of Ropak's shares.

BAD WORKPLACE EXPERIENCES BREED CYNICISM IN EMPLOYEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most cynics doubt workplace conditions will ever improve, and they blame the 
problems on management. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not all the workers' fault. Sometimes cynicism is indeed learned on 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees grow cynical when companies fail at planned changes or neglect to 
trumpet their successes when they do change, a noted human resources authority 
has found. 
</P>
<P>
 And if companies repeatedly fail at new initiatives, their workers may become 
so cynical that any future attempts at change are doomed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cynical workers are usually made, not born," said management authority John 
Wanous of Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. Wanous is co-author of a 
study of 757 workers at a Midwestern manufacturing plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cynicism about organizational change is something employees learn through bad 
experience and is not a personality trait," Wanous said. 
</P>
<P>
 Managers make a mistake by dismissing cynicism as bad-mouthing by a few "bad 
apples," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid the poison of workplace cynicism, employers need to be "honest and 
open" about their successes and their failures, said Arnon Reichers, a 
professor of human resources and co-author of the Ohio State study. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ignorance breeds cynicism in employees," Wanous noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Layoffs leave "a trail of ill will" that breeds cynicism as well, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another ingredient of cynicism is job insecurity, experts say. A study for 
Robert Half International, a staffing services company in Menlo Park, Calif., 
found 41% of 150 executives at the nation's 1,000 largest companies said job 
insecurity was "the No. 1 source of stress in the workplace today." 
</P>
<P>
 Understaffing placed second, at 32%, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Staffing cuts have been so deep in recent years that even those employees who 
have kept their jobs remain uneasy," said Max Messmer, RHI chairman and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Wanous warned that cynicism "can be so poisonous to morale that it colors 
(employees') beliefs about all aspects of the company." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he said, cynical employees paid on a piece-work basis are more 
likely to feel they are paid unfairly because they "seem to view nearly 
everything about a company in a bad light," Wanous said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hourly workers, the study found, were more likely to be cynical than salaried 
workers. But a cynical attitude is more harmful to the job satisfaction and 
commitment of the salaried workers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Salaried workers may feel more personal investment in their jobs and thus 
experience more personal anguish from cynicism, he said.

MORE TO LOVE; HIS BOD'S LARGER, HIS MANE'S TAMER. BUT FABIO SPOOF FLABIO HAS 
MADE IT BIG-TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS ROMERO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The casting call went something like this: 
</P>
<P>
 "Wanted. Male Caucasian. One-hundred to 200 pounds overweight. Must be willing 
to wear a Speedo in the surf." 
</P>
<P>
 After going through 75 portfolios, they found their man: 38-year-old Michael 
Glover of Redondo Beach. He measures 6-foot-6, 400 pounds, has deep blue eyes 
and apparently looks good in a Speedo bikini. Of course, when Glover arrived in 
Santa Barbara last January so they could photograph him wearing skivvies in 
mid-50-degree weather, he thought the whole gig was a bit strange. After all, 
here he was, a former truck driver with a 58-inch waist. And all of a sudden 
he's got a photographer telling him to flirt with the camera? 
</P>
<P>
 "They give me $150 an hour, tell me to strip down to my chones , and take 
pictures of me," Glover says. "They didn't tell me what it was about." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, Glover knows it was a historic day. For one, it was two days 
before the Northridge earthquake ("They said I might have been the main reason 
for it," he says). But more importantly, it was the making of Flabio. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Flabio on women: "I think at first a woman wants a man to be good looking, 
exciting, talented. But in the end, they want someone to love them, take care 
of them and respect them. A lot of the time it's the same guy."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Flabio was the brainchild of Eric States, a 34-year-old Santa Barbaran who 
owns a kayak accessories company. It was the fall of '93: "I have a little bit 
of a gut," he says. "One day I walked out of the shower, and I said to my wife, 
'What do you think, honey -- Fabio? Nah . . . Flabio!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Flabio, he thought, would be the perfect, cuddly counterpart to the buff bod 
of cover-stud Fabio. After an unsuccessful try at making a Flabio doll, States 
decided an easy way to market his idea would be with a poster. After the 
casting call and the beach shoot, he was still applying for a trademark. He was 
afraid the concept might get stolen, so he didn't tell many people, including 
Glover, until the day of the photo shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, States says, he faced a bidding war for the rights to distribute the 
official Flabio poster. It features Glover in a beach-bathing pose borrowed 
from the pages of Fabio's own popular chest-exposing calendar. These days, the 
$7.50 poster is sold out at the seven Xtra-Xtra Big & Tall stores throughout 
Southern California. Store workers, who display a copy behind the counter, say 
it's been a hot item for the holidays. And at the Brea Xtra-Xtra store, it 
always seems to elicit comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yuck," says a large woman shopper. "I know I wouldn't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 "Fabio probably has a few more women around him," says another. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Flabio on men versus women: "Men look at the cover of a book; women read it." 
* 
</P>
<P>
 Fabio's people have taken the parody in good humor. In fact, Steve Raimondi, 
publisher of Fabio's Healthy Bodies magazine, has enlisted Flabio. He says a 
book is in the works -- "Flabio's Healthy Diet" -- that will both parody 
Fabio's soon-to-come "Fabio's Healthy Diet" book and be a serious exercise book 
for the overweight. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has not been a spokesman for that market," Raimondi says. "Imagine a 
guy like that running," he says, "the impact on his feet, on his lower back. 
There's just a lot of exercises that he cannot do. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we're going to start him on a regimen and get him shaped up, so he can 
say, 'If I can do it, anybody can.' He'll go from Flabio to fabulous." 
</P>
<P>
 Raimondi plans to have the book in bookstores by late next year. A workout 
video, he says, is also a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabio's manager, Peter Paul of Beverly Hills, finds the parody amusing. "If 
people are interested in seeing a Flabio impersonator of Fabio," he says, "then 
Fabio wishes him the best of luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Fabio friend Helen Gurley Brown, editor of Cosmopolitan magazine, had this to 
say: "Fabio does what is called stopping traffic. He's got this long hair. I 
feel he's a palomino. I dare say Flabio might be stopping traffic also, but for 
different reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Flabio on himself: "I look at myself as a big ol' cuddly bear. I think I'm a 
fairly good-looking guy."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Glover is pretty good-humored about the whole thing. During the last year, he 
has been featured in People, on CNN and on Jerry Springer's syndicated TV talk 
show. Sometimes kids even recognize him on the street. Says Glover: "It's cool 
to be big, you know?" 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the parody has yet to make him rich. While Fabio's been known to 
drive a Rolls-Royce, Mercedes, Porsche and Jaguar, Glover drives a Chevy Astro 
van. And while Fabio is known to spend time in Manhattan and the Hollywood 
Hills, Glover lives in his mother-in-law's Redondo Beach house. 
</P>
<P>
 His last brush with this much attention was when he was a lineman for Mira 
Costa High School in Manhattan Beach, he says. "Notre Dame, USC, Ohio State, 
Nebraska were checking me out," he says. "Then I got a knee injury in the 
middle of my senior year. I was junk, they said." 
</P>
<P>
 So after a lifetime of lowbrow jobs -- Caterpillar operator, truck driver for 
a guy named Yokohama Flash, full-time dad and acting student -- Glover found 
himself in the spotlight. He'll take it as far as it can go, he says, "as long 
as they don't ask me to go bare naked." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to demean myself," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Good thing -- for all of us.

JUST THINK OF IT AS THE SEQUEL TO HIS ENTIRE CAREER; BOOKS: 'CLOSING TIME,' 
MIXING REAL AND FICTIONAL FRIENDS, IS JOSEPH HELLER'S FOLLOW-UP TO 'CATCH-22.' 
BUT NOT EVERYONE THOUGHT IT WAS NECESSARY -- OR A GOOD IDEA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Autumn is not expected to be this pleasant -- neither the autumn of the year, 
nor the autumn of life. 
</P>
<P>
 But here is Joseph Heller, legendarily cranky novelist, basking at 71 in 
autumn sun on the patio of his summery home outside East Hampton, the tony Long 
Island beach town. His thick froth of white hair shines. His tan skin glows. He 
is just back from Europe and a happy welcome for the book some thought he 
should not write. 
</P>
<P>
 Called "Closing Time" (Simon & Schuster, 1994), it is subtitled "The Sequel to 
'Catch-22.' " In Germany and England, he says with a chuckle, "They think it's 
a masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm gonna give you things that might make headlines," Heller says. "A woman 
came here to interview me -- she's well-known in England, she writes for the 
Guardian magazine. She begins the interview by saying, 'How does it feel to 
have written three of the great novels of the century?' " 
</P>
<P>
 He explains: The interviewer meant "Catch-22," the classic set during World 
War II; "Something Happened," a dark dissection of life in the corporate middle 
class, and "Closing Time." 
</P>
<P>
 The new novel finds Yossarian, the embattled hero of "Catch-22," at the end of 
his life, looking back. He is joined by Air Force buddies including Milo 
Minderbinder and Chaplain Tappmann, by a retired magazine executive named Sammy 
Singer (another "Catch-22" vet, it seems, but nameless in that book), and by 
ghosts such as Snowden, the radio-gunner whose cold death dapples the first 
book and the memories of those who have read it. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond "Catch-22" and its aging cast, "Closing Time" refers to a postwar, 
anti-war pantheon including Kurt Vonnegut's "Slaughterhouse Five," Stanley 
Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove" and Thomas Mann's "Doktor Faustus." The story 
juggles elegy and comedy, cancer and comic apocalypse. It descends from 
Manhattan's Port Authority Bus Terminal to the sub-basements of the White House 
and the circles of hell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Closing Time" recalls the suffocating offices of "Something Happened," the 
Jewish identity crises that permeate Heller's "Good as Gold" and "God Knows," 
the musings on art and economics in his "Picture This," and even "No Laughing 
Matter," his nonfiction chronicle of recovery from Guillain-Barre syndrome, a 
paralyzing nerve disease. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the sequel to Heller's entire career. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, asked why he never wrote another book as big as "Catch-22," 
Heller has riposted, "Who else has?" That bravado had to wither a bit in the 
late 1980s, when he agreed to write a "Catch-22" sequel. It would be book two 
in a two-book, $4-million deal with G.P. Putnam's Sons. The deal resulted in 
"Picture This" (1988), a critical and commercial disappointment, then, the next 
year, in cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
 Heller had started his sequel by then, but no publisher would pick it up. He 
says: "It was hard only because an agent and I had grandiose ideas of how much 
money it should and could command." He found a new agent, the well-connected 
Amanda (Binky) Urban; Urban found the sequel a home at Simon & Schuster, 
original publisher of "Catch-22." Heller calls the advance payment "relatively 
small" but fair, something under $375,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Things slid further downhill once the "Closing Time" manuscript was submitted 
last February. Word-of-mouth was downright hostile. Few magazines sought 
advance profiles of Heller. Rumor had it that no one wanted periodical rights. 
(In the end, Playboy and the Forward, the small Jewish weekly, ran excerpts.) 
</P>
<P>
 A preview feature in New York magazine called the book overambitious, offering 
quotes -- some anonymous, some attributed -- that questioned even Heller's 
right to write. Reviewers took up the gauntlet of comparison under such 
headlines as "Catch-00," "Kvetch 22," "Catch-22 2" and, more than once, 
"Catch-23." Many cited a passage where Heller skewers the cliched use of the 
phrase "Catch-22"; most missed the punch line, reading Heller himself as stale. 
(In the Los Angeles Times, William Broyles Jr. concluded: "He fails. But not 
from lack of trying.") 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't realize until I read the reviews of this book -- especially those 
that were unfavorable -- in what high esteem 'Catch-22' is held by nearly 
everybody," Heller says. "I didn't know the intensity or the extent of the 
admiration they had for the book, and, from the book, for the author." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By October, the official month of publication, the tide turned. "Closing 
Time," Heller says, "got better reviews from what I would call 'prestige' 
publications than any of my other novels: the Sunday New York Times, the New 
Yorker, the New York Review of Books, the Philadelphia Inquirer and the Chicago 
Tribune." 
</P>
<P>
 With some reservations, "prestige" reviewers praised the project: a reflection 
on the world Heller has known and, to some extent, on the way the world knows 
him. Long lyrical passages, told in first person by Sammy Singer and his old 
friend Lew Rabinowitz, evoke Depression-era Brooklyn and a World War II 
shatteringly different from that in "Catch-22." 
</P>
<P>
 "The war experiences were war experiences," Heller explains. "They were not 
pure figments of my imagination organized to produce the effect of 'Catch-22.' 
The war itself was not particularly funny." 
</P>
<P>
 On a separate, intersecting story plane, Heller splashes the new Yossarian 
tale, a broad farce of America in the '90s. Friends of the author, such as 
writers Mario Puzo and Kurt Vonnegut, drop in. Heller sprinkles his own 
thoughts and experience among Sammy, Lew and Yossarian. When Yossarian falls in 
love with a nurse, for example, she is described as old enough to remember 
"Pearl Bailey but not Pearl Harbor"; Heller used that line in "No Laughing 
Matter" to describe his own nurse, now his wife, Valerie. Sammy Singer even 
mentions a boyhood pal named Joey Heller, an aspiring writer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Closing Time" is no autobiography, but real people stand behind many of its 
characters, and Heller readily distributes their phone numbers. Marvin Winkler, 
for instance, a fictional crony of Sammy and business associate of Milo 
Minderbinder, is also an old friend of Heller. He calls the book's version of 
their youth "totally accurate." 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe is accurate all the time," says Winkler, who lives in Santa Monica. "I 
never had a problem with Joe being accurate. I had a problem with him being 
nasty, but now he isn't nasty anymore. He's nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Heller reworks fictional friends too. Yossarian's escape at the end of 
"Catch-22" might have inspired a generation, but the author is unsentimental: 
"He would have had to've been compromised. He would've had to make the same 
adjustments to the social realities that I made and that everybody in my 
generation made, and that Sam Singer made." 
</P>
<P>
 Yossarian, it turns out, was caught shortly after Nately's whore brought her 
knife down on the last page of "Catch-22." "It's hard not to be disappointed," 
Heller admits. "You do have that romantic ending in 'Catch-22.' Everybody's on 
Yossarian's side, and they're rooting for him, and he's become a spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Nichols' movie version of the ending was more romantic still. In "Closing 
Time," Yossarian tweaks the idea of escaping in a little yellow raft on open 
seas. But Heller says his own view of World War II was never Yossarian's. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was mainly an adventurous and delightful experience, extremely satisfying, 
extremely romantic," he says. A picture of a teen-age Joe Heller, smiling, Air 
Force flier's cap at a jaunty tilt, hangs in his study among bestseller 
memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of "Closing Time" have already covered the advance payment. That means 
royalties will soon start to mount, Heller notes, "so go out and buy some 
books." Simon & Schuster has reissued "Catch-22," like the new book, in both 
standard hardcover and a $125 boxed edition. 
</P>
<P>
 Heller has heard, though it surprises him, that some in Hollywood believe 
"Closing Time" is filmable. A TV producer is flying a World War II B-25 bomber 
to East Hampton, reuniting Heller with his (and Yossarian's) old plane for a 
Learning Channel documentary. He is ready to write again, waiting for the right 
idea; he's already rejected two or three. Guillain-Barre has left his muscles 
weak, and he gets hoarse quickly, but mostly, he feels just fine: "My 
digestion, thank God, is very good. So is my appetite." 
</P>
<P>
 The sun is high at closing time. Joseph Heller says he is "extremely pleased 
with myself at this point in my life. I'm a successful novelist. I'm held in 
very high esteem by many of the people in this country and other countries. I'm 
71 years old. My health is very good. I look good; I know this because people 
tell me. My wife says I have amazing skin. I know I have my hair. I have very 
few causes to be displeased." 
</P>
<P>
 And what did he say when that Englishwoman asked how it felt to have written 
three of the great novels of the century? 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Heller, on the bright line between braggadocio and self-mockery, says: 
"My answer was, 'I'm embarrassed, that's how it feels. If you make it the last 
half of the century, I might be able to discuss it with you.' "

A QUEST FOR TRUTH; VIETNAM VET ANNE LABEL HOPED TO CLEANSE HER SOUL OF WAR'S 
PAIN. INSTEAD, SHE OPENED OLD WOUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She had been there before, to China Beach and Da Nang and up the fabled Marble 
Mountain, working as an Air Force medic in a country heavy with the stench of 
death that was the war in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 At the U.S. field hospital in 1970, soldiers were shot and dying. Anne Label 
knew some of them, including her fiance, an Air Force flier lost in combat. 
Others were soldiers without limbs, soldiers without hands, soldiers who could 
not write home. So she wrote their letters for them and, over time, could no 
longer bear the stress of trying to save lost lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne Label cracked up. She was sent home after suffering a nervous breakdown. 
She resigned from the Air Force, and for the next quarter of a century she 
locked away her past, forgot Vietnam. It was only after her wedding that she 
was even able to tell her husband that he had married a veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 That much of Label's personal odyssey, while unique in its particulars, is of 
a familiar type for those who bear the emotional scars of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened next is not familiar at all. Label, now a medical-textbook 
illustrator and mother of two little girls in Westlake Village, followed a 
different road -- one that she now dearly wishes she had avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 She found a whole new way to make Vietnam's agony live on. Hoping to cleanse 
her soul of the guilt that rode with her on her helicopter flight out, last 
summer she went back to Vietnam as a tourist, planning to make a charitable 
donation to help rebuild that ill-fated country. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead she came upon strings of dog tags she believes may have belonged to 
missing American GIs. She was given the decaying skull of what could be a dead 
soldier. 
</P>
<P>
 It brought back the nightmare, made all the worse when U.S. military officials 
working in Vietnam dismissed her evidence as phony and told her that she had 
been duped by a Vietnamese subculture that preys on the good intentions of 
well-meaning Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She had gone back looking for salvation. She left with a suitcase of sorrow 
and a new and broiling anger over the U.S. legacy in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't wait to leave that country again," she said. "I ran out of there." 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Stephen E. Thompson, a career Army field investigator who has spent five 
years in Southeast Asia hunting for clues to American MIAs, had never met 
anyone like her in Vietnam. He remembered that she seemed so bent on trying to 
absolve herself of the blood spilled in Indochina. He had seen others with 
similarly noble aims, but nothing like this, least of all a female veteran 
knocking on his door in Ho Chi Minh City with what appeared to be more than 
2,000 American dog tags and the skull and teeth of a dead man. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, who commands a unit assigned to search for the remains of Vietnam 
War veterans, and other Pentagon officials said they reviewed the dog tags and 
twice sent the skull out for forensic examinations. None of it turned out to be 
authentic, Thompson said. Rather, he said, Label was most likely duped by 
Vietnamese traders who deal in fake booty and hope to make a U.S. dollar off 
American naivete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think her intentions were probably honorable, but she got caught up in it 
and saw herself as somebody trying to do the right thing," Thompson said. 
"Maybe now she realizes she was taken and that perhaps is hardest of all for 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-two years old, with rich black hair and eyes as dark or darker, Label 
cannot hide her anger over how she says she was treated by Thompson and other 
U.S. military officials. She is stunned that she was so quickly dismissed as a 
rube. 
</P>
<P>
 Since returning to Southern California, she has managed to channel her anger 
into work with veterans groups. It has helped her embrace her troubled past. 
She has joined the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post in Thousand Oaks. She 
purchased personalized license plates that identify her as a AMVET." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's very gung-ho now on veterans issues and especially MIAs," said Gerald 
Reingans, past commander of the VFW Post named after Eric J. Huberth, a 
25-year-old Air Force captain from Thousand Oaks when his plane was lost over 
Cambodia and he joined the ranks of the missing. 
</P>
<P>
 But does he actually believe that some of Label's dog tags, including one she 
asserts belonged to Huberth himself, can be real? Does he really think that the 
skull and the teeth are from one of the unaccounted Americans in Southeast 
Asia? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's possible," Reingans said. "Anything is possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Diamond, who runs BRAVO -- the Brotherhood Rally of All Veterans 
Organizations -- in Thousand Oaks, does not doubt her at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe her story because of the sincerity I feel in her," said Diamond, 
chain-smoking cigarettes in the BRAVO headquarters office not far from Label's 
home. "Let me tell you: Her word is enough for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "And what she has been through, I've been down some of those same dark paths. 
But most especially I believe her because of how the Army has treated her." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I am appalled and I am angry and I am hurt that the American Army would do 
this to me," Label said. "I was no threat to them, but I think I embarrassed 
them because I came up with some items they couldn't find." 
</P>
<P>
 Label, the wife of a Southern California neurosurgeon, returned to Vietnam to 
help support a school in Hue, just north of Da Nang. The elementary school for 
poor Vietnamese lacks even toilets and water fountains, and Label agreed to 
donate $1,000 a month to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 She also did some sightseeing and shopping. Near China Beach, she met some 
street vendors. One said she was the daughter of a dead Viet Cong commander. 
</P>
<P>
 Label said this woman told how her father, during the war, hoarded weapons and 
dog tags and scrap metal taken from downed planes, and how he hid them in caves 
inside the nearby Marble Mountain range. The huge rocks of limestone and marble 
are home to dozens of caverns, which were used by Viet Cong guerrilla fighters 
as both sniper posts and hiding spots. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman told how her father, on one of the last occasions that he spoke to 
her, advised her to go back and sell the metal if the family needed money. Her 
father died in the war, and now the family was poor and the woman wanted $20 
for the dog tags. 
</P>
<P>
 Label bought them, about 2,500 of them. Looped together in strings, the tags 
were dirty and spotty with what Label described from her medical training as 
blood. The tags also were worn and corroded and, in many cases, the names could 
not be made out. In addition, many of the serial numbers on the tags were no 
longer decipherable. 
</P>
<P>
 She also said she was led one night by a young man to a "very small, a very 
poor village which I did not get the name of." There, she was told that 
villagers were superstitious about a small burial site near the scene where a 
U.S. helicopter had once crash-landed. 
</P>
<P>
 They took her to a burial site and unearthed what she said was a man's skull 
and what was left of his jaw and teeth. Wrapped inside the eye and nose cavity, 
she said, was a chain and a dog tag belonging to a Marine identified only as 
E.A. Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted these bones out of their village," she said. "They were poor 
people who make 40 cents every other day taking firewood to market, and they 
were superstitious and they did not want the American soldiers to return and 
find them." 
</P>
<P>
 In Ho Chi Minh City, she turned over the material -- all of it -- to Thompson 
and his crew. But she said she was immediately met with disinterest and 
skepticism. She said they told her she had been duped by Vietnamese traders. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials declined to keep the dog tags after examining them and 
concluding that they were fake. But they did accept the skull, and they 
promised to keep her informed on their progress in determining its origin, she 
said. She never heard from them again. 
</P>
<P>
 Label said she didn't know what to do with the dog tags. She was afraid to 
take them to the airport, where she feared she might set off metal detectors 
and/or prompt Vietnamese officials to detain her. So she stayed up late three 
nights in her hotel room, writing down the names on the tags. She copied about 
2,000 of them. She gave most of the names to Thompson, she said, and finally 
headed for the airport with her baggage and about 125 names. 
</P>
<P>
 There she reluctantly tossed the dog tags in the trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson says the tags are part of a vast underground industry run by 
Vietnamese who make and sell them for money or for visas to get out of that 
country. "All the names were checked and none of them matched," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But of the 125 names Label brought back on her hotel stationery, about a dozen 
appeared to match the names of the dead memorialized on the walls of the 
Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington. Two other names matched with MIAs. But 
the serial numbers were gone from both tags, making a positive identification 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 The first was Capt. Huberth. His mother, Jeanne Huberth of Mesa, Ariz., said 
only one boot belonging to the co-pilot was ever recovered. After all these 
years, she has concluded her son must be dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Could this now be her son's lost tag? "Anything is possible over there," she 
said. "I have no idea." 
</P>
<P>
 The second MIA was Marine Corps Capt. Richard A. Miller, 26, of New York. He 
and three colleagues were lost during a combat mission in South Vietnam when 
they were shot down by enemy fire. 
</P>
<P>
 His brother -- Eric N. Miller, an accountant in Westford, Mass. -- said he 
believes that Richard survived the crash but was later captured and killed. It 
is only intuition that drives this belief. In the past, a pistol and the dog 
tag of one of the other men have been recovered. And now comes his brother's 
dog tag? 
</P>
<P>
 "The Viet Cong could have kept his dog tag, so I don't know," Miller said. "It 
doesn't surprise me that it could be his dog tag." 
</P>
<P>
 The skull is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said it was examined by forensic anthropologists both in Hanoi and in 
Hawaii, where the Vietnam recovery team is headquartered. Exhaustive 
examinations determined it was human, he said, but also "definitely" Mongoloid. 
In other words, it was not Caucasian. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two Bakers who were Marines and who died in Vietnam and who could 
match the dog tag found with the skull. But the serial number on the tag was 
gone, making it unclear whether either of the Bakers was the right soldier. 
</P>
<P>
 One was Cpl. Ernest Austin Baker Jr. of Opelika, Ala., killed in May, 1968. 
But his mother, Kathleen Baker, said her son's body was brought home and buried 
in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 The other was Lt. Cpl. Elwood A. Baker of Battiest, Okla., lost in June, 1967. 
He was also brought home and buried, but his family said military authorities 
would not allow them to view the body because they said it was disfigured. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said we would regret it if we looked in the casket," said his sister, 
Wanda Bohannon, a classroom tutor in Battiest. "They said it was best we didn't 
look inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Told that it might not be her brother's skull that Label found anyway because 
the Pentagon said it was Mongoloid, Bohannon grew very quiet for a long time. 
Then she said something that made it clear she believes it might be her 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are Native American," she said. "We are full-blooded Choctaw Indian." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The truth, like so much that haunts the debate over whether Americans were 
left behind in Southeast Asia, will probably never be told. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, stories such as Label's journey back to Vietnam surface and fire 
up the debate. Rarely do they end in any definitive conclusions. This one does 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 Label and the countless other veterans who cannot let go of that war plod on 
with their scarred lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Army assumes I'm a stupid, naive housewife who was off on a little 
vacation," she said, now back to her routine of driving the kids to school and 
doing volunteer hospital work for the local VFW. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Army is bigger than me," she said. "Maybe I'm ready now to give up and 
let them win."

BODY WATCH; THE NEVER-ENDING EARACHE DEBATE; EAR INFECTIONS ARE VERY COMMON -- 
90% OF CHILDREN WILL HAVE HAD AT LEAST ONE BY THE TIME THEY TURN 6. BUT DOCTORS 
HAVE YET TO AGREE ON THE BEST TREATMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "Mommy, my ear hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 The refrain is all too familiar to many parents, for few children totally 
escape this frustrating and persistent childhood ailment. 
</P>
<P>
 On any given day, up to 30% of American children will be suffering from an ear 
infection, according to one study. And 90% of youngsters will have had at least 
one by the time they turn 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, half of those who have ear infections before the age of 1 will have 
six or more within two years, says Dr. Kenneth Grundfast, chairman of the 
department of otolaryngology at Children's National Medical Center in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that ear infections are so common, there is little consensus 
-- and considerable debate -- among doctors about how to treat them. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, a federal advisory panel issued its verdict on one piece of the 
problem: Its members recommended that children with persistent fluid buildup in 
the ears -- a common condition that often leads to chronic ear infections -- 
should first be treated with "watchful waiting." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee, convened by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, 
said that fluid buildup should not be treated until it has lasted at least 
three months. The condition, known as otitis media with effusion, often 
disappears by itself within that time period, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, fluid produced in the middle ear drains through the Eustachian tube, 
a tiny channel that connects the middle ear to the back of the throat. In 
children, fluid accumulation is common because their Eustachian tubes tend to 
be shorter, narrower and more horizontal than in adults. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An ear infection occurs when bacteria begin to grow and more fluid is produced 
as part of the body's response to the infection. Fluid presses against the 
eardrum causing pain and a red, bulging eardrum. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes ear infections will clear up without treatment. But most doctors 
choose to treat infections aggressively -- maybe too aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians in the United States "probably over-treat" for suspected ear 
infections but do so only "because the complications can be life-threatening 
and one wants to hedge on the side of caution," says Dr. Maureen Strohm, 
associate professor of clinical family medicine at the USC School of Medicine. 
These rare complications include a perforated eardrum, mastoiditis (an 
infection of the mastoid bone behind the ear) or meningitis. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors are particularly quick to address persistent fluid in the middle ear 
because fluid that lingers can impair hearing. This can be especially critical 
for a child younger than 2 who is learning to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 In treating ear infections and persistent fluid, the choices usually follow 
two basic routes: first, therapy with antibiotics or other drugs, and -- as a 
last resort -- surgery, Strohm says. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, 10 to 14 days of antibiotics will eliminate infections. Even when the 
drugs work, however, they don't always solve the problem. Many children quickly 
develop new infections because antibiotics don't always eliminate the fluid, 
and bacteria simply begin to flourish again. Many doctors recommend a course of 
preventive, low-dose antibiotics to keep ear infections from occurring and to 
rid the middle ear of fluid. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Surgical incision of tubes is the most controversial of all treatments for ear 
infections and persistent fluid -- yet it is now believed to have replaced 
tonsillectomy as the surgical procedure most frequently performed on children. 
</P>
<P>
 There is considerable disagreement about when the procedure is necessary. 
Often, it depends on the length of time a child has had fluid, the number of 
ear infections in any given period, the extent of hearing loss and the child's 
age. For example, a child under the age of 2 who has had recurrent ear 
infections in any given period and has persistent fluid that is not eliminated 
by antibiotics would be a good candidate for tubes. 
</P>
<P>
 The simple, outpatient surgery involves making a tiny incision in each 
eardrum, draining out the fluid -- known as a myringotomy -- and inserting a 
tiny ventilation tube in each hole. This enables air to reach the middle ear 
and prevents further accumulation of fluid. 
</P>
<P>
 Children with tubes rarely suffer infections. Even more important, the tubes 
dramatically improve hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Like any surgery, there are risks, such as reaction to the anesthesia. 
Moreover, the tubes usually fall out in six to 12 months and sometimes the hole 
does not heal properly, requiring more surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tubes are proven to be effective," Grundfast says. "They reduce the 
frequency of infections and they restore normal hearing. But like any surgery, 
they are to be used only when medical therapy fails." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the controversy, there is almost always good news ahead. Most children 
outgrow ear infections by age 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although ear infections are a real problem and very difficult for parents 
while they are occurring, it should be reassuring to know that children 
eventually do grow out of them," says Dr. Dean Blumberg, assistant professor of 
pediatrics at UCLA. "Parents should keep this in mind: Eventually, it will get 
better."

TYLER AND ANNE KLEIN PART WAYS; FASHION: INSIDERS SAY THE LOS ANGELES DESIGNER 
AND THE NEW YORK-BASED FIRM COULD NOT AGREE ON JUST WHO THE 'ANNE KLEIN' 
CUSTOMER IS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The short but fruitful relationship between Los Angeles designer Richard Tyler 
and New York-based Anne Klein & Co. has come to an abrupt end, both parties 
announced Monday. In a joint statement they blamed the break-up on "differences 
pertaining to the future design direction of Anne Klein Collection Sportswear." 
</P>
<P>
 Insiders say Tyler, who with his wife and partner Lisa Trafficante have a baby 
and new home in the Hollywood Hills, wants to spend more time with his family 
and concentrate on his own collection, which will include a menswear line 
scheduled for unveiling in New York next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement comes on the heels of Tyler's being named Best Designer of 
the Year by the prestigious Council of Fashion Designers of America for his 
eponymous collection, an award that would seem to ensure success apart from 
Anne Klein. 
</P>
<P>
 But in May, 1993, when Tyler was named to replace 18-year Anne Klein veteran 
Louis Dell'Olio as the company's chief designer, many had never heard of him. 
Still, the Australian designer's sexy, meticulously tailored suits were coveted 
by a cadre of Hollywood actresses, including Julia Roberts, Anjelica Huston and 
Nicole Kidman. Tyler seemed the perfect and adventurous choice to update the 
$800-million sportswear company's stodgy image. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the course of the next three seasons, Tyler, 46, took the company from 
conservative to cutting-edge while continuing to produce his own line. 
</P>
<P>
 But some privately worried that he was taking the Anne Klein line too far, too 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Insiders say Tyler grew unhappy with the company's interference in his work. 
There was a disagreement over who the "Anne Klein" customer was. The company's 
vision of its customer was, in Tyler's view, "a dinosaur," said one associate. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, though, Tyler was excited by the challenge of what he said 
was returning the house to its origins. While working on his first collection 
for Anne Klein, Tyler said he looked through the company's archives to study 
Klein's designs. "Basically, she made clothes for the working woman. And her 
jackets were unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 So, according to critics, were Tyler's meticulously tailored jackets for his 
short-lived Anne Klein collection. And at $900 they were a relative bargain, 
considering the Tyler-labeled jackets sell for closer to $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler's star rose in the fashion world. By the end of 1993 he was was named 
Best New Designer by the CFDA and his name was being spoken in the same breath 
as those of Donna Karan, Calvin Klein and Giorgio Armani. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no word yet on who will replace Tyler at Anne Klein.

FROM 'STREET FIGHTER' TO 'ER'; AFTER 'JOY LUCK CLUB,' ACTRESS MING-NA WEN FINDS 
DIVERSITY IN CAREER ROLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK FLEISHMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If an actor's range -- the ability to define diverse characters -- is a 
career-making trait, then Ming-Na Wen has little to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider her most visible roles: As June, she was the piano-playing daughter 
whose story was central to last year's multi-hankie film "The Joy Luck Club." 
In the new thriller "Street Fighter," which opens Friday, she plays Chun-Li, a 
kick-boxing television reporter who helps save the Free World, while managing 
to look stunning in red silk. And she has just joined the cast of the rookie 
NBC drama "ER," a hit with both the public and the critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 'ER' role was not Asian-specific, and my agent knew that I loved the 
show," Wen, 26, says. 
</P>
<P>
 Receiving a visitor in her West Los Angeles duplex, she is fitting an 
interview into a typically busy day. A movie script lies close at hand, ready 
for an audition scheduled later in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I was between movie gigs, we were looking for something to do on 
television. I told my agent, 'Get me on "ER" -- that would be great.' Then this 
role came up," Wen said. "When I (auditioned), it was me and a dozen Caucasian 
actresses." 
</P>
<P>
 She will begin appearing on "ER" on Jan. 12, playing a third-year medical 
student at County General Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 If a role is not "Asian specific," Wen is ready to hear reluctance on the part 
of casting directors. "I'm so used to it, it doesn't even faze me," she says. 
"Sometimes I can tell -- they won't take the risk." It's a constant challenge 
in her career, she says, as well as for other Asian actors. "What I want is the 
same opportunities as anyone to get a part. I'm as proud to be Chinese as I am 
American." 
</P>
<P>
 As it happened, the role in "Street Fighter," which is based on the popular 
video game, called for an Asian woman, a reporter who joins Jean-Claude Van 
Damme's renegade force to defeat a power-mad dictator, played by the late Raul 
Julia. The role, Wen says, "is the antithesis of June in 'The Joy Luck Club.' I 
had to convince (writer-director) Steven de Souza and (producer) Ed Pressman -- 
they couldn't see me as this tough, aggressive fighter. I started doing 
(martial arts) kicks in Pressman's office. That got his attention." 
</P>
<P>
 The petite actress is buffed up in the film, displaying the toned muscles and 
swift moves of the dojo-trained kick-boxer she plays. Her preparation for the 
role was "really intense, especially the three weeks before the film." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Damme impressed Wen. "He's very intelligent, and very charismatic, and of 
course he's a big flirt. But he's a fun flirt." Asked if she'd like to do more 
action pictures, Wen's reply is immediate. "If George Lucas calls, I'm there! 
I'm trying to show I'm a trained actress -- I can transform myself into 
different characters. I'm not just an ingenue." 
</P>
<P>
 Wen grew up outside Pittsburgh, where her parents, immigrants from Macao, ran 
a restaurant. Her mother had performed with the Peking Opera and Wen was always 
interested in theater. As a child, she loved "dressing up. I still love that 
part of it -- to be able to dress up and create a character and walk in with 
it." After high school, she attended Carnegie-Mellon Institute, famed for its 
theater program, then headed to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 She was acting there with the Ensemble Studio Theatre when director Wayne Wang 
expressed interest. "He came out to see me, and then he flew me to L.A. twice." 
Wen knew she could play the part of June, but Wang had been looking for an 
actress with more "visibility." "They questioned me for 45 minutes about my 
life, and why I had such a kinship with June. I had to express my most inner 
pain, which is difficult for me." The film was one of 1993's sleeper hits -- "I 
can't tell you how many strangers have come up to me and thanked me for making 
them cry." 
</P>
<P>
 Wen still tries to find time to return to live theater, occasionally as a 
producer. "I produced a couple of plays in New York that were successful, and 
when I came out here, I saw the play 'Exit the Dragon.' It starred three male 
actors, really just exploring the pop-culture Asian American stereotypes for 
men. It expressed a lot of pain but in a humorous way. I wanted to produce it 
because I feel that a lot of people from all backgrounds can learn a lot from 
it and be entertained at the same time. I'd like to take it to New York." 
</P>
<P>
 Wen remains close to her parents. In fact, she says, "Mom takes all the credit 
for my success. Now Mom says, 'I read your face when you were a baby, and it 
said you were going to be a star. That's why I named you Ming -- because it's 
all about the sun and the stars, and enlightenment.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Even for the 'ER' audition" -- Wen is laughing out loud now -- "I had to fly 
back early from Thanksgiving in Pittsburgh, and Mom says, 'We brought you good 
luck.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Taking stock, Wen says, "I'm happy. I'm not one of those actresses that's 
going to feel like I never achieved my dreams and goals and just get 
disgruntled and hate everything about the business. I've had so much fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thank Buddha -- and Mom."

GABRIEL BYRNE HAS A PASSION FOR FILMS, BUT IT'S NOT FROM ACTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE McKENNA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 When Irish actor Gabriel Byrne attended the Oscars last March, his interest in 
the proceedings was a bit different than might be expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Byrne established a solid acting career following his screen debut in 
1981 (he played King Arthur's father in the John Boorman film "Excalibur"), and 
is currently getting glowing notices for his performance as a poor German 
philosophy professor in Gillian Armstrong's remake of the Louisa May Alcott 
classic "Little Women," he has his sights set on things other than acting. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer of last year's critically acclaimed political drama "In the Name of 
the Father," Byrne also brought 1993's "Into the West" to the screen, and feels 
himself to be on the brink of a new phase in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten great satisfaction out of the two films I've produced because 
they've enabled me to express things I'm passionate about," says the 
44-year-old actor over breakfast at the pool of a Hollywood hotel. "As an actor 
I don't have that opportunity because I'm not a No. 1 box-office star. I don't 
see myself as a successful actor, and though I admire great actors, I've never 
been obsessed with acting." 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't to suggest Byrne is calling it quits on his acting career. 
Currently in Santa Fe, N.M., shooting "Buffalo Girls," a miniseries based on a 
Larry McMurtry novel that co-stars Melanie Griffith and Anjelica Huston and 
airs in May on CBS, Byrne has been recently seen co-starring with Steve Martin 
in "Twist of Fate" and with Joanne Whalley-Kilmer and William Hurt in "Trial by 
Jury." He'll turn up in '95 in "The Usual Suspects," a low-budget independent 
directed by Brian Singer, whose debut film, "Public Access," was a hit on the 
film festival circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The script for 'The Usual Suspects' was very hip and I really loved it," says 
Byrne. "I had a great time on 'Little Women' too, but what I'm preoccupied with 
at the moment is the first-look producing deal I signed with Miramax in 
September. Last year, I formed a production company in Ireland called Mirabilis 
Films with Patrick Rainsford and we have three movies on the slate, but 
Mirabilis can't deal with all the ideas I have -- I have ideas for a dozen 
projects for Miramax." 
</P>
<P>
 One wonders where Byrne found the time to court Miramax, considering that one 
of the projects set to go at Mirabilis will mark his debut as a director. An 
adaptation of Patrick McGrath's novel "Dr. Haggard's Disease," "The Secret of 
Wyndham Hall" was co-written by Byrne and Rainsford and is slated to start 
shooting next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne also plans to direct "Lark in the Clear Air" sometime next year, a film 
he describes as being about "magic, a dysfunctional family and the Cuban 
missile crisis." Byrne and his wife of seven years, actress Ellen Barkin, were 
originally slated to star in the film, but that plan was scrapped when the 
couple separated early this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a strange time for me," says Byrne, picking halfheartedly at a 
blueberry muffin. "Professionally, I'm happy with the way things are going, but 
privately I'm going through a separation and that has a big effect on how you 
feel." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Byrne has been typecast as the quintessential brooding Irishman, he 
isn't brooding now. Cordial and intelligent, he dismisses the disparity between 
reality and what he describes as "his one-dimensional persona" as "part of this 
business. You have to work to live, and not every actor can be picky about what 
he does -- hence, one becomes typecast." 
</P>
<P>
 It is but one of the reasons that Byrne has embraced producing with such 
enthusiasm. Describing "The Secret of Wyndham Hall," which will shoot on 
locations in London and Cornwall, as "a film that looks at different kinds of 
human love," Byrne is excited at the prospect of being behind the camera rather 
than in front of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's the ordinary love that's between friends," begins Byrne, outlining 
the ideas central to the film. "Then there's romantic love, which is mostly 
based on the 12th-Century notion of courtly love. What we'll attempt to say in 
the film is that people become addicted to the high of romantic love, but 
ultimately it's not real." 
</P>
<P>
 In talking with Byrne it becomes apparent that he likes to burrow into any 
subject that comes up. It was this aspect of his personality that brought him 
to the attention of Patrick Rainsford, an electronics engineer who sold his 
company to raise the seed money to start Mirabilis Films. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Dublin in 1950, the son of a cooper in a brewery, Byrne had what he 
describes as "a 19th-Century childhood. We lived in a land of hay carts and 
farms on a little road leading to the mountains." One of six children, Byrne 
was raised by his father, who lost his job in the early '50s, while his mother 
worked as a nurse. Byrne recalls his childhood, steeped in literature and 
Catholicism, as idyllic, yet oddly impoverished. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children in Dublin in the '50s were not brought up to believe they could do 
what they put their minds to," he says. "Consequently, the biggest obstacle 
I've had to overcome in life is a lack of belief in myself. One of the keys to 
my beginning to accept myself was an acceptance of life as it is. Man isn't 
here to have fun -- he's here to learn things about himself." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This belief squared neatly with a decision Byrne made at the age of 12 -- to 
become a missionary. He was to spend the next four years at a seminary in the 
English countryside, but, expelled for smoking, he returned to Dublin, where a 
scholarship to University College led to studies in languages and archeology. 
In 1978 he became involved with a Dublin-based theater group that included 
actor Liam Neeson, and two years later landed a role in the popular Irish 
serial "The Riordans." 
</P>
<P>
 His most acclaimed performance has probably been in the Coen brothers' 1990 
film, "Miller's Crossing," where he played a stoic '30s gangster, a character 
tailor-made to his minimalist style. In "Little Women" (opening Wednesday he 
plays the poor but earnest Friedrich Bhaer, who befriends the willful writer, 
Jo March, played by Winona Ryder. 
</P>
<P>
 One gets the impression, however, that Byrne is much more interested in 
discussing producing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three years ago I produced a play in London about a miscarriage of British 
justice that involved six Irishmen known as the Birmingham Six, and I'd also 
organized readings for the Guildford Four," he says, explaining what led him to 
produce "In the Name of the Father." "The concept of justice fascinates me." 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne's concern with social issues will surface again in "Lark in the Clear 
Air," which he wrote and will direct. "The pivotal event in the story is the 
Cuban missile crisis," he says. "That was the first time I realized there were 
events over which I had no control. It was the beginning of global terror and 
it terrified me." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he believes movies have a responsibility to address social issues, 
Byrne says, "I believe that our views on everything from how we perceive 
nationalities to how we fall in love come from movies we've been exposed to. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having said that, I have to say, no, movies don't have a duty to have a 
political conscience," he says. "I often hear people say, 'I want to go to the 
movies and be swept away -- I don't want to sit there and have to think about 
my life' -- and that's a legitimate desire. It's no good being on a soapbox in 
the middle of the desert."

SEASON'S GRATINGS; FED UP WITH THE USUAL, 'GOOEY' HOLIDAY FARE? 'A DOLT'S ONLY 
CHRISTMAS PAGEANT' OFFERS AN ALTERNATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Christmas pageants aren't supposed to come with warning labels. Tradition 
demands that they proclaim, "Come one, come all, and don't forget the kids!" 
</P>
<P>
 Not so with Revolving Door Productions' "A Dolt's Only Christmas Pageant," 
which opens Wednesday for a three-night run at the Tribune Theatre. There it 
is, standing out like a guy with a hockey mask and chain saw, on the show's 
press releases: "NOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN OR IMPRESSIONABLE ADULTS." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody else seems to be doing their basic Christmas shows, you know, like 
SCR (South Coast Repertory's 'A Christmas Carol') and others," said Joel Beers, 
the 28-year-old writer of this program featuring holiday carols, poetry, 
dancing, Santa and an original Christmas-themed play. "We figured that instead 
of jumping on the bandwagon, we'd do something with a twist. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pageant, in general, is satirical, but there won't be nudity or flagrant 
obscenity. With the disclaimer, we didn't want a mom and dad to open up the 
paper and say, 'Wow, let's go down and see it.' We're taking one of the most 
sacred cows (Christmas) and skewering it." 
</P>
<P>
 Beers said the carols will be sardonic little numbers, some new and others 
with familiar tunes but lump-in-the-stocking lyrics. Nobody's sure about the 
dancing yet, but it should be slammin'. Santa is certain to be rife with 
ho-ho-hos, but he'll also be packing a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the poetry, it will be dark, humorous, biting, whatever. Here's a 
taste, from Beers' friend and fellow poet Tom Rush's "Potterville," a mocking 
take on that seasonal staple by Frank Capra, "It's a Wonderful Life": 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Capra lied, George Bailey jumped  
</P>
<P>
 George Bailey got swept away  
</P>
<P>
 Down the raging, freezing torrent of the Bedford River  
</P>
<P>
 The back of his skull bashed in by a hurtling ice floe.  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of the show is Beers' "An Anti-Chri 
</P>
<P>
 ma$ Carol," a good-natured but admittedly sneering sendup of Dickens' classic. 
</P>
<P>
 In Beers' reinvention, Scrooge is replaced by Doris, someone "who's totally 
into Christmas, can't get enough of it." The problem is, nobody shares her 
enthusiasm. Everywhere Doris goes in this time-shifting, dimension-crunching 
journey, she finds Scrooges and Grinches. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of Marley's Ghost, Doris encounters a janitor from her elementary 
school. He starts her on the path toward Christmas Past, which Beers described 
"as a montage of movie cliches," to Christmas Present ("a plantation owner/TV 
evangelist") and Christmas Future, a junkie. 
</P>
<P>
 Beers swipes at sentimentality, among other things, but delivers a roundhouse 
when it comes to the holiday's commercialism. One of his favorite scenes 
features shoppers "chanting like pigs, banging the ground with their credit 
cards . . . basically, they act like a bunch of pigs." 
</P>
<P>
 The piece, which lasts about 40 minutes, isn't intended to be insulting -- 
only different and possibly cathartic, Beers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an alternative to the gooey stuff out there," he said. "The spirit of 
the holidays permeates everything; it's almost offensive. You feel that if you 
don't walk around with a big smile on your face, you're a freak. 
</P>
<P>
 "The theme of the show is to be true to yourself. If you hate (Christmas), 
then feel free to really hate it. If you love it, then get into that, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Beers, who noted that he actually enjoys the season and has fond memories of 
it ("I couldn't sleep for days when I was a kid"), isn't worried about 
offending his audience. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, he believes people should have a sense of humor when it comes 
to just about everything. Second, most folks who arrive for Revolving Door 
Productions offerings, which has been staging mostly original, avant-garde 
plays at the Tribune Theatre for the past several months, know what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have regulars (and) the audience is usually hip to what we do; in fact, 
they expect us (to try) something different," said Beers, whose drama, "Indio," 
received mostly good reviews when Revolving Door premiered it in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being different, that's our niche, especially in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Beers knows that things can go too far, that certain people can become 
enraged by the humor. It happened to Beers last year during a holiday poetry 
reading at Chapman University. 
</P>
<P>
 "A friend and I were doing one of our songs and this guy, a drunk, got really 
angry," Beers recalled. "He wanted to beat us up. It took a while to calm him 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 * Revolving Door Productions presents Joel Beers' "A Dolt's Only Christmas 
Pageant," including the original comedy "An Anti-Chri 
</P>
<P>
 ma$ Carol," opens Wednesday and runs through Friday at 8 p.m. at the Tribune 
Theatre, 116 1/2 W. Wilshire Ave., Fullerton. $5. (714) 525-3403.

LAGUNA THEATER GETS $150,000 GRANT PLEDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Laguna Playhouse received a $150,000 matching grant Monday from the James 
Irvine Foundation to help equip a planned second venue in South Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant, requiring a dollar-for-dollar match from other funds to be raised 
by the playhouse, will go toward stage lighting and sound equipment for a 
225-seat theater in a former Bank of America branch building on Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The playhouse bought the property for $880,000 in February and in May received 
City Council approval to use the building as a theater. Architectural plans 
will go before the city's design review board Thursday for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of converting the building is expected to run between $500,000 and $1 
million, according to playhouse executive director Richard Stein. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still don't have a hard figure," Stein said. "But we've selected Shea 
Business Properties to do the renovation work, and they'll be coming up with 
one soon. I hope by July we will be in the throes of construction. It's our 
understanding that once the remodeling begins, it shouldn't take longer than 
six months to accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
 The architectural plans have been drawn up by John von Szeliski and 
Associates, a Newport Beach firm that specializes in theater design. Szeliski 
helped create the design for the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa 
Mesa. Shea, based in Walnut, is a major building contractor for residential and 
commercial property development.  
</P>
<P>
 The playhouse has completed the first phase in a capital campaign to finance 
the building conversion. "We've successfully solicited all the members of our 
board of directors," Stein said. "I'm not at liberty to divulge how much they 
gave, but it was substantial." 
</P>
<P>
 In the second phase, the company will apply for grants from corporations and 
private foundations. The last phase will target individual contributors from 
the public through telephone solicitations, benefit performances and other 
marketing efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board has decided it wants all the funds pledged before we start 
construction," Stein said. "We still have a ways to go." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1920, the playhouse is the county's oldest theater company. It also 
is the largest community theater, with 8,000 subscribers, and one of the 
largest in that category nationwide. This year the nonprofit company has an 
annual budget of $1.4 million, which underwrites its five-play season at the 
419-seat Moulton Theater and a youth troupe. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moulton, built in 1968, will continue as the playhouse's major venue for 
revivals and musicals. These are largely cast with paid amateur actors. A 
limited number of union professionals represented by the Actors' Equity Assn. 
are allowed to appear under an Equity guest contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The second theater would enable the playhouse to expand its offerings to new 
or current plays. It would be operated under an Equity agreement requiring a 
specific number of union actors per season (to be negotiated) and union stage 
managers for all productions.

TV IMAGES KEEP GETTING FASTER AND FASTER

 The images are relentless -- screeching subways, an imploding building, 
exploding fireworks. They flash for a second but the driving beat makes them 
move even faster, just a few of the 54 snapshots that bombard the viewer in the 
63-second opening credits of ABC's "NYPD Blue." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the show itself moves a bit more slowly, it's still fast enough to 
send a whiplashed viewer to the "ER." But be prepared to dodge a hospital 
gurney and any of the dozen or so plots woven into each episode of that show, 
whose pace is even quicker. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, you may want to think about attaching a seat belt to your couch. 
The television set may still be sitting in the corner, but the images are 
moving faster than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many TV experts point to advertising as the major influence on pacing, both in 
terms of altering film styles -- many TV and film directors began with 
commercials -- and conditioning the audience to want everything right now. 
</P>
<P>
 MTV, with rapid cuts and a non-narrative style, has had a similar effect on 
mainstream TV, said Steven Fore, an associate professor at the University of 
North Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 TV is moving faster today for many reasons: Restless viewers, armed with 
remote controls, won't hesitate to hit the expanding cable highway. And 
technology -- lighter cameras, digital editing machines -- allows for 
quick-paced presentations.

 SHOW OF FORCE: All the political rhetoric about the crime bill on Capitol Hill 
has finally produced results back home: Ventura County has been offered enough 
money to hire 15 new police officers, part of a program to provide 4,700 new 
cops nationwide (B1). . . . And that could be just the start. The $30-billion 
program contains money for a variety of community crime prevention programs 
(A4). 
</P>
<P>
 DANGER ZONE: It's an odd sign to see on public parkland: DANGER ARTILLERY 
RANGE. But no one is going to be shooting at the Broome Ranch in Newbury Park, 
except for the producers making a commercial for Rold Gold pretzels. The ad, 
set to run Super Bowl Sunday, features "Seinfeld" actor Jason Alexander 
parachuting into an artillery range, says park Ranger Gary Moser. "What a 
talent," Moser said. The ranger watched Saturday as a crew set up three new 
signs and then painted them to look old. Producers are paying park officials 
$2,700 to use the land for the commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 SURF'S UP: The waves that knocked nine pilings off the Ventura pier Monday 
(B1) also gave surfers a wild ride with breakers as high as 10 feet. "It's the 
biggest day of the year, probably two years," said Keith Neary, after finishing 
a morning surf session. . . . The waves were generated by a violent storm at 
sea that stopped about 1,000 miles off the coast. After a long spell of calm 
seas, surfers can rejoice: There's another big swell due to hit Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 GOING TO SEED: From a tiny tomato seed has grown a veritable vegetable empire. 
Using genetic engineering and old-fashioned cross-pollination, the researchers 
at Petoseed Co. in Saticoy created seedless watermelons and tomatoes hearty 
enough to survive diseases that leave other varieties withering on the vine. . 
. . Now the firm is being merged into a new giant agribusiness firm with 
branches in 35 countries (Valley Business, Page 9). Officials say the merger 
should not affect jobs here.

THORNTON CONVICTED OF KILLING WESTLAKE NURSE; COURTS: JURY'S 13 GUILTY FINDINGS 
INCLUDE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE THAT COULD SEND 20-YEAR-OLD TO GAS CHAMBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County jury, deliberating for less than five hours Monday, convicted 
a 20-year-old Thousand Oaks man of murder and a special circumstance that could 
send him to the gas chamber for last year's slaying of Westlake nurse Kellie 
O'Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Scott Thornton, whom prosecutors branded a cold-blooded killer but 
defense attorneys called an immature and impulsive young man, sat stoically as 
Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath read guilty verdicts to the 13 counts 
he faced. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very upset about the verdict as far as the special circumstance," said 
Deputy Public Defender Susan R. Olson, adding that Thornton broke down and 
sobbed as soon as he left the courtroom. "He's very frightened about what he's 
facing." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they were pleased with the jury's findings and will continue 
to push for the maximum punishment when Thornton's penalty hearing begins in 
about three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's only two choices, and we will be requesting a death sentence," Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most serious charge against Thornton involved the Sept. 14, 1993, 
carjacking and killing of O'Sullivan, the mother of a young son. Prosecutors 
believe he killed her for her car, which he later used to abduct his former 
girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors told the jury that Thornton kidnaped O'Sullivan in broad daylight 
in front of a Thousand Oaks pet store, forced her to a desolate area in the 
Santa Monica Mountains and shot her once in the chest and twice in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Sullivan's badly decomposed body, still clad in her nurse's uniform, was 
found 12 days later by two volunteers who had joined hundreds of others in a 
massive demonstration of community unity to search for the missing woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton had been arrested seven days earlier in Reno, where he was in 
possession of O'Sullivan's Ford Explorer vehicle and a .38-caliber snub-nosed 
revolver, which later was proven to be the murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that evidence, the clean-scrubbed, soft-spoken defendant maintained 
his innocence after his arrest in an interview with police and during a taped 
jail visit with his 68-year-old grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton never took the witness stand, and his attorneys did not admit he was 
the killer until closing arguments last week. Still, they implored jurors to 
find him guilty of only first-degree murder and not the special circumstance 
that could send him to his death. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorneys told the jury that Thornton is immature and speculated 
that he probably killed O'Sullivan in a moment of panic, perhaps as she lunged 
for his gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors called such speculation absurd and urged the jury to return a 
verdict that would make Thornton eligible for the gas chamber. After Monday's 
verdict was read, jurors remained bound by an admonition not to speak about the 
case until after they make a recommendation for his penalty -- life in prison 
or death. 
</P>
<P>
 But clearly, everyone involved in the case was surprised by how quickly the 
jury came back with its decision of guilt. The jury began deliberating about 
9:30 Monday morning. About 4 p.m., the foreman told the bailiff that decisions 
had been reached on all counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Kossoris acknowledged that the jury wasted little time reaching a 
decision, but said he did not want to read too much into it at this stage in 
the proceedings. "From trying cases for 28 years, I never can even predict 
myself how long they will be out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys also were reluctant to comment on the quick verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 As workers from the public defender's and district attorney's officers crowded 
into the courtroom to watch, McGrath questioned the jury on each guilty 
verdict. In addition to murder, kidnaping and robbery, the jurors returned 
guilty verdicts on forgery, grand theft and non-sufficient funds check charges 
-- all crimes committed to aid Thornton's escape from the county after he stole 
the nurse's vehicle, prosecutors have contended. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton was also convicted of using O'Sullivan's vehicle to kidnap his former 
girlfriend and of shooting at the girl's mother during that abduction. 
</P>
<P>
 During the seven-week trial, the prosecution said the defendant needed 
O'Sullivan's vehicle to abduct 16-year-old Stephanie Campbell and leave town. 
He wanted to leave town because juvenile authorities had issued a warrant for 
his arrest for a probation violation and because he had cashed a series of bad 
checks, prosecutors argued. Thornton also wanted to take Campbell with him 
because she had recently broken off their relationship, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell was a key witness against Thornton, testifying that during the five 
days between her abduction and Thornton's arrest, she was afraid for her life. 
Thornton, she said, had threatened to kill her if she tried to escape as they 
drove around Northern California and then to a Reno casino. There, she notified 
a security guard that she had been abducted. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next phase, Thornton's attorneys said they plan to show jurors that 
Thornton had suffered a terrible childhood and hope to elicit some sympathy. 
"It's obviously a very difficult task we're facing now to try and get together 
this young man's life to show what led up to Sept. 14, 1993," Olson told 
reporters. "Anyone who sat through the first phase of the trial knows that 
there was a dysfunction in his family and at school. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a long history of turmoil in his family. He never knew his biological

LITTLE THRILLER FROM WRITER OF 'LITTLE WOMEN' TO APPEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Random House publishers announced Monday that it will publish next fall a 
previously unknown novel by American children's book author Louisa May Alcott 
that is completely unlike her previously published novels. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcott, who died in 1888, wrote classic tales of family life, such as "Little 
Women" and "Little Men." She also fought slave owners and beef-eaters and 
supported women's rights. Come next fall, she may become known as a good 
old-fashioned thriller writer. 
</P>
<P>
 Called "A Long Fatal Love Chase," the 273-page novel set in Europe is about a 
woman, Rosamond, being chased by a drug-using cad twice her age, Philip 
Tempest, who wants to marry and imprison her while she fights for her freedom 
in and out of castles, convents and insane asylums and across moors. 
</P>
<P>
 There are fistfights, murders and hints of sex, real and imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 Written in 1866, two years before "Little Women," the novel was rejected by 
her publisher on the grounds that it was too sensational. Random House editor 
Ann Godoff said it is, in fact, "a very adult novel." 
</P>
<P>
 "I imagine it is the most adult work she ever produced," Godoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as editing goes, there is little she would change, Godoff said, even if 
there was a way that she could commune with the author. But she says she is not 
a fan of the title, since it gives too much of the plot away. 
</P>
<P>
 The work was housed for years with Alcott's other papers in Boston's Houghton 
Library. Then Alcott's descendants put it up for sale, and it was bought by 
Kent Bicknell, a rare book collector and founder of the Sant Bani school in 
Sanbornton, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
 Bicknell said he also acquired the copyright. He struck an agreement with 
Random House to publish the book, hoping for increased sales stirred by the new 
film version of "Little Women." 
</P>
<P>
 "Alcott wrote a lot of Gothic short stories that have only been published 
since the 1950s. They will be republished next year under the title 'Louisa May 
Alcott Unmasked.' She was a fascinating woman -- an abolitionist, a vegetarian, 
a fighter in the women's suffrage movement and the temperance movement," he 
said.

VENTURA OKS FUNDING AID FOR 2 LIBRARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura's two largest libraries -- staffed at a minimum, shuttered half the 
week -- will receive a $145,000 boost from city coffers starting in January, 
council members decided Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to intensifying pressure from residents, the council voted 5 to 1 
to reach into city reserves so that downtown's E.P. Foster and mid-town's H.P. 
Wright can stay open longer each week.  
</P>
<P>
 The decision brought cheers of relief from the book lovers in the audience, 
many of whom have counted on the extra money since the council's finance 
committee recommended the expenditure earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council did well tonight," said Betty Black, a retired librarian who 
lives in Ventura. "Every little bit helps, and this is a step in the right 
direction, but this isn't the end. This isn't where we want to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 But the vote was not unanimous, and Mayor Tom Buford warned that Ventura was 
locking itself into an expenditure that residents would not let be shrugged off 
in the coming years. Councilman Jack Tingstrom was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the city is going to participate as a partner in the library system, we 
ought to go into it knowing what we are getting into, knowing what we will be 
spending, and knowing what will be our responsibility," Buford said. 
</P>
<P>
 The libraries are now funded by the county through property taxes. With the 
extra city money, the branches will stay open a total of 13 more hours a week 
between January and August. Wright library will also receive an automatic 
check-out machine, further reducing staffing needs at the branch. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of all ages came out Monday night to persuade the council to invest 
in its libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we kids don't have libraries, then we can't do the reports required," said 
11-year-old Shawn Fields. "And if we can't do the reports required, then we'll 
get an F or an incomplete. "And if we're get an F or an incomplete, it'll be 
your fault," the fifth-grader said, looking squarely at the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wright and Foster libraries currently operate on a patchwork of schedules, 
one closing as the other opens for a total of 36 hours each week. A staff of 10 
employees shuttles between the two facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the $145,000 boost, many city and library officials admitted that 
Monday's vote would purchase only temporary peace of mind.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that buys us some time, opens up our libraries, so we can 
look at long-range solutions," Councilman Gregory L. Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long term, they said, the city must find a new home to house its entire 
library collection. 
</P>
<P>
 One site mentioned repeatedly at the finance committee meeting is a vacant 
furniture store at the Buenaventura Mall. Carson, however, said the building 
will need extensive and costly retrofitting work. 
</P>
<P>
 Librarians and residents have also talked about pursuing a ballot measure next 
year assessing landowners $10 to $30 for each parcel, to ensure permanent and 
ample funding for the local libraries. Council members said Monday that the 
city staff should look into the feasibility of this idea. 
</P>
<P>
 The finance committee considered the issue because the Library Board, a city 
advisory committee, asked the city last month to provide the funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The board has also come under increasing pressure from library administrators 
and residents to do something about the situation at Foster and Wright. Some 
board members wanted to shut down Wright, at least temporarily, and move all 
its books to Foster so it could operate 40 hours a week.  
</P>
<P>
 That proposal, however, met with fierce resistance from other board members as 
well as many eastside residents, and it was shelved.  
</P>
<P>
 Wright is far more popular with readers than is Foster, circulating nearly 
225,000 books a year to Foster's 107,000.  
</P>
<P>
 But Foster is the county's main reference library, with a collection of 
133,000 volumes. Wright, by contrast, has only 97,000 books. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright is now open Mondays from 2 to 8 p.m., Wednesdays from noon to 6 p.m. 
and Saturdays from 1 to 5 p.m. Foster is open Tuesdays from noon to 8 p.m., 
Thursdays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 1 to 5 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A recent library fund-raising drive raised $7,677 from residents, allowing 
Wright, beginning in January, to stay open two hours later on Wednesday and 
Foster to begin operating two hours earlier on Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
 The fund-raising efforts also paid for the Avenue Library, the city's smallest 
branch, to open at 1 p.m. instead of 2 p.m. on Mondays. The Avenue branch on 
Ventura Avenue nearly closed two years ago, but a city telethon collected 
enough money to keep it open until June, 1996.

TAKING A POUNDING; HIGH WAVES RIP OUT 9 PILINGS, CLOSING THE VENTURA PIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Huge storm-driven waves battered the Ventura Pier on Monday, ripping out nine 
pilings and creating a powerful current that threatened to toss surfers against 
the wooden landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they are worried that more 60-foot supports near the 
weakened section will splinter and break away before repairs can be made. 
Another strong swell from the northwest is expected to hit the Ventura coast 
Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get really huge waves and then we lost another handful in that area, 
there is a concern," said building inspector Allen Bovitz. "We could lose the 
pier." 
</P>
<P>
 The barnacle-covered pilings that tore loose were at least 50 years old and 
all from a section about one-third of the way down the 1,958-foot walkway. They 
had been found structurally sound during a $3.5-million restoration of the pier 
completed last year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first ones were spotted breaking away just after dawn. They continued to 
wash out one-by-one through the morning as waves splashed up through the pier's 
wooden planks. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight of the poles washed ashore south of the pier, leaving a gaping section 
with little support. Just one piling remained in a row that previously had five 
supports. 
</P>
<P>
 "The power in those waves is tremendous," Bovitz said. "It just finally took 
its toll on that particular spot." 
</P>
<P>
 Hueneme Pier suffered no damage, authorities said. And boaters at Channel 
Islands and Ventura harbors had no serious problems, although some fishermen 
chose to remain at dock. 
</P>
<P>
 Replacing the nine Douglas fir poles is expected to cost $25,000 to $30,000 
and take at least several weeks, said Tim Jonasson, a city civil engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest obstacle is finding pilings that are the right size. The city 
already has a few on hand, but others will have to be bought from cities with 
wooden piers or ordered from lumber companies in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 If new ones are ordered, the repairs could take months longer because each 
piling is cut from a tree hand-picked in the forest, Bovitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pier, the longest of its type in California, will remain closed until the 
work is complete. Police were called Monday afternoon to keep fishermen and 
passers-by away until a temporary fence was placed at the pier's entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Bovitz, who inspected the damage, said the crashing waves caused the wooden 
deck to sway much more than normal. "It's an E-ticket ride," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of surfers felt the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 As the swell grew through the morning, sending in sets of waves six to nine 
feet high, the parking lot at Surfer's Point in Ventura grew unusually full for 
a Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 By 10 a.m., state lifeguards had stationed themselves just above the pier to 
warn surfers and body boarders about the treacherous rip currents that could 
sweep them into the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Attention surfer. Remove your leash and paddle straight to shore," bellowed 
Ranger Jerry Weil through a loudspeaker as a teen-ager on a body board drifted 
toward the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfers run into danger, he said, when they ride waves toward the pier and 
then try to paddle back out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The current's so strong it makes it hard to paddle out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lifeguards ran into the surf half a dozen times as surfers neared the pier, 
but no one was injured. Most managed to make a bee-line for shore before 
getting too close to the pilings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This happens every winter," Weil said. "This is big, but not as big as it 
gets." 
</P>
<P>
 State rangers began advising surfers to remove their leashes -- the cord that 
tethers them to their boards -- after a teen-ager became entangled in the 
pier's pilings in the early 1980s and drowned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was working as a lifeguard that day," Weil said. "There was nothing anybody 
could do." 
</P>
<P>
 The surfers who ventured into the water Monday -- and some preferred to gawk 
from shore -- expressed a healthy respect for the size of the waves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been out in surf this big for a couple years," said David Brown, 
39, of Sherman Oaks. "You've got that adrenaline rush and a little bit of 
fear."

HIRING GRANTS OFFERED; LOCAL POLICE MAY PASS; LAW ENFORCEMENT: SIX COUNTY 
AGENCIES ARE GIVEN THE CHANCE TO ADD OFFICERS UNDER CLINTON ANTI-CRIME PROGRAM. 
BUT OFFICIALS SAY THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MATCH FUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Six Ventura County police departments have been offered up to $1.1 million in 
federal money to hire a total of 15 additional officers as part of President 
Clinton's $30-billion anti-crime package. 
</P>
<P>
 But some local police officials say the federal program requires them to match 
funds -- and despite an urgent need for more officers, they may not be able to 
pay their part.  
</P>
<P>
 Police agencies in Ventura, Oxnard, Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley and Camarillo, 
along with the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, were notified Monday that 
they may begin recruiting new officers while their grant applications are 
awaiting approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The money comes from the U.S. Department of Justice's Cops Ahead program, in 
which up to $225 million in grants will be made available to state, local and 
other law enforcement departments serving populations of 50,000 and over. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, a police department receives a grant for up to 75% of an 
officer's total salary and benefits, not to exceed $75,000 per officer for 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 To receive the funds, the state or local law enforcement agency must agree to 
match that amount by at least $25,000 per officer for the three years, and that 
may reduce the number of local departments that take part. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, starting salary for a police officer in Simi Valley is about 
$36,000, so the city would have to ante up $11,000 in salary, plus benefits, 
Sgt. Gary Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Police Department has received the federal go-ahead to hire 
three new officers, but Lt. Tony Harper said police officials are trying to 
determine if the program is worth participating in. 
</P>
<P>
 "We simply sent the letter of intent to see what the program would offer," 
Harper said. "Now we have to see if we want to take part."  
</P>
<P>
 There are 105 sworn police officers in the Simi Valley department -- an 
increase of about six in the past two years, Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Sheriff's Department probably will not take advantage of 
the grant to hire two new deputies because the county cannot match funds, said 
Undersheriff Dick Bryce. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not optimistic at all that the (Ventura County Board of Supervisors) 
will come up with the rest of the grant money," Bryce said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the department added 120 new deputy positions this year to staff the 
new county jail, bringing the total to 675 sworn officers, it is still 
understaffed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura Police Department also is unsure if it will use the federal grant 
money to hire three more police officers, but Lt. Steve Bowman said police 
officials are eager to see if the grants are as good as they sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman said the force has been cut from 123 in 1993 to 116 today, and more 
officers are desperately needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're certainly not going to pass up any opportunities to add some more 
police officers, but at this point we're still trying to determine the costs 
for us," Bowman said. "We're eager to find out about this and how it can 
benefit us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks Police Department was offered money for two officers and the 
Camarillo Police Department was offered funding for one. Both contract for 
patrol services with the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard Police Department -- one of the most understaffed police forces of 
its size in the nation -- was offered money for four new officers. Police 
officials did not return calls for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The county police departments were among 631 jurisdictions nationwide that 
were offered funds to hire up to 4,688 officers -- part of Clinton's pledge to 
put 100,000 new officers on the streets. The latest round of federally assisted 
hires would raise the total to about 9,500 new officers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement agencies serving areas with populations of fewer than 50,000, 
such as the Santa Paula Police Department, are eligible for a separate program 
titled Cops Fast and must submit applications before Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cmdr. Mark Hanson of Santa Paula said the little department has been 
snubbed several times while vying for its share of crime bill money, adding 
that the grants being offered are small and not worth the hassle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're just going to pass on that because, frankly, we couldn't do 
much with that little money anyway," Hanson said. "It's a waste of our time."

LAND DEAL CLEARS WAY FOR CAL STATE CAMPUS; EDUCATION: CITRUS GROWER AGREES TO 
SELL 200 ACRES FOR SITE NEAR CAMARILLO, LIFTING A 30-YEAR BARRIER TO A VENTURA 
COUNTY UNIVERSITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Camarillo lemon grower on Monday said he has agreed to sell 200 acres to the 
Cal State University system, clearing the hurdle that has blocked Ventura 
County from building its own public university for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State officials have scheduled a news conference this morning to announce 
details of the agreement, moments after they inform the Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors of the breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
 If the sale goes through as planned, it would be the first time Cal State 
officials have been able to acquire land for a Ventura County campus in more 
than 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past eight years, university officials have tried to buy parcels in two 
other locations in Ventura for a campus. But local opposition forced them to 
back away from those deals, leaving Ventura County the state's most populous 
county without its own public four-year college. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the break we've been looking for," said Peter MacDougall, chairman of 
an advisory committee of volunteers pushing for a local state university. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Mohseni, whose family owns 200 acres west of Camarillo, said he was 
pleased with the transaction, despite a condemnation suit filed against him by 
Cal State officials to acquire the land. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy to be contributing in a small way to Ventura County being able to 
get a four-year university after 10 or 12 years of effort by the state 
college," Mohseni said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have preferred they had not acquired our property," he said. "But I 
was not ready to have them give up on the idea of having a state university in 
Ventura County because of us." 
</P>
<P>
 The deal calls for the state to acquire 200 acres owned by the Mohseni Ranch 
off Central Avenue, and a neighboring 60-acre parcel owned by Sakioka Farms, 
Mohseni said. Specific terms of the deal will not be disclosed until this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohseni said the deal almost fell through in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very apparent to me that the university was ready to walk away from 
the whole project," Mohseni said. "They didn't have sufficient funds and they 
appeared frustrated and about ready to give up." 
</P>
<P>
 David Leveille, the Cal State director of institutional relations who handled 
much of the negotiations for the state university system, could not be reached 
Monday. His spokeswoman declined to comment on the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Joyce M. Kennedy, the longtime director of the Ventura satellite campus of 
Cal State Northridge, said she is looking forward to this morning's 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard there was positive news, but I haven't heard the details," she said. 
"But it sounds very promising. It's a wonderful Christmas present to look 
forward to." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy has been working for years to expand the Cal State Northridge Ventura 
campus to a full four-year university. She formed a community task force to 
further the efforts of building a local university, and has spearheaded 
fund-raising events to pay for books and other supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature has set aside more than $5 million to acquire property for a 
Cal State campus in Ventura County, Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 But MacDougall, the Santa Barbara City College president who chairs the 
advisory committee, said lawmakers in Sacramento need to follow up the land 
acquisition with money to build the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are difficult times," MacDougall said. "Hopefully we'll be able to 
persuade those who need to be persuaded that this is an investment in the 
people of Ventura County and southern Santa Barbara County." 
</P>
<P>
 George Sakioka, whose family owns 60 acres of vegetable crops neighboring 
Mohseni's lemon groves, said Monday that he looks forward to having a public 
university in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're glad this is finally happening," he said. "We think this is a very 
positive thing for the county of Ventura. We've just been waiting for the other 
side to settle." 
</P>
<P>
 A local state university has been planned by Cal State officials for nearly 30 
years, when then-Gov. Pat Brown signed a bill authorizing $20,000 to study 
potential sites for the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 But a series of setbacks has delayed those plans. The state bought 425 acres 
in Somis in 1969 to build a university, but sold the land seven years later. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, Cal State officials targeted several hundred acres in Ventura, just 
west of the Ventura Freeway. But opposition from nearby residents of the 
Ventura Keys neighborhood thwarted that project and university officials 
abandoned the site months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State planners then looked north to Taylor Ranch, a sweeping hillside 
parcel near the intersection of the Ventura Freeway and California 33. Once 
again, opposition from local residents and the Ventura City Council prompted 
Cal State officials to back away from the controversy in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the following year that Cal State officials earmarked the 260 acres of 
lemon trees and vegetable crops in the greenbelt between Oxnard and Camarillo 
for the long-planned campus. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mohseni Ranch, which owns roughly four-fifths of the site, refused to sell 
for three years, forcing the state to file a condemnation proceeding to acquire 
the land.

RULE OUT PERJURY CHARGES BECAUSE TESTIMONY DID NOT AFFECT OUTCOME OF TRIAL IN 
KING BEATING.

 Former Los Angeles Police Officer Theodore Briseno probably lied under oath 
during a 1992 Simi Valley trial concerning the videotaped beating of motorist 
Rodney G. King, Ventura County prosecutors said Monday, releasing the findings 
of a little-known 10-month investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 But perjury charges will not be filed against Briseno because his testimony 
did not affect the outcome of the trial of Briseno and three fellow officers, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the officers were acquitted of all charges, and the fourth was 
cleared on all but one -- verdicts that sparked rioting in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of LAPD officials, Ventura County prosecutors reviewed the Simi 
Valley testimony of the 41-year-old former officer to determine if he had 
committed perjury. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Ronald C. Janes, who conducted the probe, concluded 
that Briseno apparently lied on April 3, 1992, when he told the Ventura County 
jury that he tried to report the King beating to superiors shortly after it 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors said they decided against charging Briseno with perjury after 
reviewing numerous court and administrative documents. For a statement to be 
considered perjury, it has to have the potential to influence the outcome of 
the case, Janes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although this evidence tends to indicate that Officer Briseno lied, proving 
this beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury would be exceedingly difficult," Janes 
concluded in his 18-page report. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno's attorney, Harland Braun, criticized the report, the Los Angeles 
Police Department and prosecutors in both counties. The LAPD first referred the 
matter to the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, but Ventura County 
prosecutors conducted the review because Briseno's testimony was given in Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they've basically done is use the Ventura County district attorney's 
office to slander him," Braun said of LAPD officials. "Can you imagine another 
trial now? Do you think they want another Rodney King trial up in Simi Valley?" 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD Detective James Miller, the internal affairs sergeant who presented the 
case to prosecutors, declined to comment, saying the issue is a confidential 
personnel matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno was also acquitted in a federal trial of attacking King but was fired 
by the LAPD for excessive use of force. Some former colleagues criticized 
Briseno for saying that the officers were "out of control" during the 1991 
beating. He acknowledged that he kicked King, who later won a $3.8-million 
civil award. 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno insisted his kick was designed to keep King on the ground so the 
motorist could be arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 His testimony was used in the federal civil rights trial that led to the 
convictions of former Sgt. Stacey C. Koon and former Officer Laurence M. 
Powell. The fourth officer, Timothy E. Wind, was fired two months after the 
King beating but later became a community service officer in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 Braun said that Ventura County prosecutors, by concluding that Briseno 
probably lied but declining to file charges against him, are appeasing police 
officers who believe that his client broke an unwritten "code of silence." That 
term generally means that police officers will not testify against one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno's wrongful-termination lawsuit to regain his job is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony that prompted the perjury investigation, Briseno insisted that he 
drove to a police station and tried to report the incident to a lieutenant. 
Unable to find the lieutenant on duty, Briseno testified that he let the matter 
go because Koon had filed a computer message that he was making the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Other officers on duty that night do not recall Briseno returning to the 
station, looking for the lieutenant or reading Koon's message, Janes' report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A probationary officer riding with Briseno that night told authorities that 
Briseno appeared to have headed directly to his next call after the beating, 
the report said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PIRU; COUNTY TO DISCUSS REDEVELOPMENT ZONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tiny community of Piru -- hit hard by the Northridge earthquake -- could 
move one step closer to establishing a redevelopment zone to pay for rebuilding 
under a plan being considered by the Ventura County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The board today will consider adopting a "survey area" of the proposed Piru 
redevelopment zone, which would include most residential and business areas in 
the community of 1,200, said Mary Walsh, a county administrative analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 By adopting a survey area before Jan. 1, Walsh said, the county would reserve 
its right under state law to expedite the process of creating a redevelopment 
zone at a later date. "It just allows us to keep our options open," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a preliminary study has found that the creation of a 20-year 
redevelopment zone in Piru could generate enough property tax money to pay for 
a $1.3-million to $1.5-million bond for capital improvements, Walsh said. The 
community suffered an estimated $3 million in damage in the Jan. 17 quake.  
</P>
<P>
 If a redevelopment zone is ultimately approved, it would mean that any new 
property taxes generated from residential or commercial development would go 
back to the community to pay for improvements, Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfonso Gaitan, president of the Piru Neighborhood Council, said Piru 
desperately needs the redevelopment zone to help rebuild its downtown 
area.CARLOS V. LOZANO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; DESALINATION NOT A PRIORITY, REPORT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura's existing water supply should last for the next 15 years, so the city 
will not need to build a desalination plant any time soon, according to a 
report approved Monday by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan recommends that the council and city staff members keep an eye on the 
water situation in coming years, but refrain from making plans until the supply 
falls near a critical level.Residents voted in 1992 to build a desalination 
plant if the water supply again became scarce. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a study the council received in February -- citing conservation, an 
increased supply from Lake Casitas and more water banking -- the report states 
that a supplemental supply will not be immediately necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, titled the Comprehensive Water Resources Management Plan, is the 
product of months of work by the council's three-member utility committee, made 
up by Mayor Tom Buford and Councilmen Steve Bennett and Jack Tingstrom.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: EX-FIRE DEPT. CLERK ADMITS BURGLARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Ventura County Fire Department supply clerk pleaded guilty Monday to 
charges that he broke into four stations after luring fire crews away with 
false alarms. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard resident Paul F. Lopez, 34, who had hoped to become a firefighter, 
appeared before Municipal Judge Vincent J. O'Neill in Ventura to plead guilty 
to four of the eight counts of burglary that were filed against him Dec. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, according to an agreement between defense attorney Victor Salas Jr. and 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kim Gibbons, is expected to be placed on probation and to 
serve no more than a year in County Jail, Gibbons said. Sentencing is set for 
Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first count of burglary, the crew of Station 31 in Thousand Oaks 
responded to a false report of a motorcycle accident at 1 a.m. last March 11, 
later finding that about $30 in food and money was stolen during their 
15-minute absence. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 19, Station 46 in Simi Valley was burglarized after receiving a 911 
report of a possible heart attack, and Station 34 in Thousand Oaks was hit 
after being called to a motorcycle accident about 35 minutes later. Both 
reports were false. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 10, Station 56 in the Malibu area east of Mugu Rock was broken into 
after receiving yet another false report of a motorcycle accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The burglaries, which prompted authorities to tighten firehouse security, 
typically involved petty cash and sometimes personal possessions. Most, if not 
all, have been returned, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 In none of the cases were there signs of forced entry, leading detectives to 
suspect the thief either knew secret door-lock codes or had a key. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, as a supply clerk and courier, probably would have had access to the 
necessary keys and entry codes to door locks, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been depressed, attorney Salas said last week, because a knee injury 
had prevented him from becoming a firefighter. GREG RIPPEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; TEEN-AGER DIES AFTER TRUCK CRASHES, 
BURNS

<P>
 A Santa Paula teen-ager was killed when his truck crashed into a concrete 
culvert and burst into flames, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Huizar, 17, a farm worker from Mexico, was pronounced dead at the scene 
of the crash, which occurred about 12:15 a.m. Sunday on Telegraph Road east of 
Olive Road near Saticoy, a Ventura County coroner's official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the pickup truck left the roadway for unknown reasons and 
crashed into a drainage ditch. The vehicle caught fire and Huizar died 
instantly, the CHP reported. 
</P>
<P>
 He was alone in the truck, investigators said. It is unclear whether Huizar 
was wearing his seat belt or whether alcohol or drugs played a part in the 
accident, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huizar is survived by his parents in Mexico, the coroner's office said. JEFF

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: JUDGE HEARS WATER STORAGE PLAN DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County Superior Court judge heard arguments Monday on whether a 
proposal to store millions of gallons of drinking water underground violates 
state public-notice laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Barbara A. Lane said she will issue a written decision by Jan. 17 and 
put the project by Calleguas Municipal Water District on hold until then. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph and Mary Viramontez said Calleguas had failed to notify landowners 
properly about a plan to install five wells near Moorpark. The couple owns the 
land on which the water district wants to install the wells. 
</P>
<P>
 But lawyer Barry A. Ross, representing the water district, said the district 
had complied with the notification rules in the California Environmental 
Quality Act by publishing two advertisements in local newspapers. The judge 
expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of the newspaper notices, pointing 
out that one of them was published on a holiday, making it appear that the 
district "was looking to push something through." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer Glen M. Reiser, representing the Viramontezes, warned that the project 
"lays the groundwork to triple the population of the county of Ventura" and 
should therefore be subject to a full environmental review. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross, while acknowledging "some relationship between the availability of water 
and future population," said the stored water would be used for drought 
protection and emergency needs. IRA E. STOLL

<P>
 An Oxnard police officer was slightly injured Monday afternoon after his 
motorcycle sideswiped a van and a pickup truck at Ventura and Gonzales roads in 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Officer Timothy Lumas, 37, was heading south on Ventura Road and 
approaching a red light when he began to ride down the line between two lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 As he approached from the rear of a pickup truck, the light turned green and 
the gap between the two vehicles closed. Police said Lumas sideswiped the 
pickup and the van before falling down on the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 The drivers of the two vehicles -- Mark Magallanes, 30, of Oxnard and Lorne 
Grant, 58, of Oxnard -- stopped immediately and assisted Lumas. 
</P>
<P>
 Lumas was treated for minor injuries at St. John's Regional Medical Center and 
released. Police are investigating the incident. JAN STEVENS

 One week after illegally granting pay increases for the city attorney and city 
manager behind closed doors, the Simi Valley City Council reconsidered the 
matter in open session Monday and approved the raises again. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Lin Koester will receive a 2.5% increase, boosting his total 
compensation by $3,946 to $187,199.City Atty. John Torrance will receive a 3.5% 
raise, increasing his pay and benefits by $4,142 to $147,186. The raises are 
effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed to reconsider the matter in public after questions from The 
Times prompted Torrance to acknowledge that he had improperly advised the 
council to grant the raises. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance said he was unaware of changes in the state open meeting law when he 
advised council members they could discuss and decide on such raises in private 
without informing the public in advance. SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; AHMANSON LAND TO PLANT 2,000 OAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ahmanson Land Co. has launched the latest phase of a long-term program to 
replace hundreds of oak trees that must be cut down to make way for its planned 
mini-city in the hills southeast of Simi Valley, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Preparations are under way to transplant 2,000 five-foot oaks from a nursery 
to various spots around Ahmanson Ranch, said Stan Roberts of Ag Land Services, 
the company caring for the trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The planting was modeled after a pilot program conducted last year in which 
100 trees were planted around the ranch, said Gil Nielsen, senior vice 
president of Ahmanson Land. 
</P>
<P>
 The company last month planted hundreds of acorns in small containers, where 
they will be kept until they mature. According to Nielsen, in about a year, 
they will be transplanted into larger containers, where they will be kept for 
about two more years. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,000 trees were planted in 1989, in the first phase of the 
reforestation program, Ahmanson officials said. The company plans to plant a 
total of 4,000 trees as part of a development agreement that requires it to 
plant five trees for every one destroyed in building the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson Land Co. wants to build 3,050 homes, two golf courses and 400,000 
square feet of commercial space in a hilly area southeast of Simi Valley near 
the border of Los Angeles County. Many area residents oppose the project and 
several lawsuits have been filed to block it. 
</P>
<P>
 In an environmental review of the project, it was estimated that 1,300 oak 
trees would have to be cut down, Ahmanson officials said. The company has 
altered its plans and reduced the number to 700. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak trees seem to be having a difficult time regenerating in many parts of 
Ventura and Los Angeles counties, said Rosi Dagit, conservation biologist for 
the Topanga-Las Virgenes Resource Conservation District. FRANK MANNING

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; SPEED HUMPS OKD TO SLOW TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to concerns over speeding traffic, the Simi Valley City Council has 
agreed to install speed humps, a stop sign and increase enforcement on a busy 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-nine residents of a half-mile stretch of Kadota Street signed a 
petition asking for speed humps. 
</P>
<P>
 A study conducted by the city showed that the speed and volume of traffic on 
Kadota between Alamo Street and Austin Avenue meet the requirements for the 
traffic-slowing devices. The stop sign will be installed at the intersection 
with Austin. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all traffic on Kadota exceeded the 25 m.p.h. speed limit, with most 
traffic going at least 35 m.p.h, the study showed. 
</P>
<P>
 The stretch of road includes many homes and a Boys & Girls Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a residential area," said resident Sue Coffey. "Speed humps would be 
less expensive than the loss of a life or a limb." 
</P>
<P>
 But several residents from nearby Galveston Avenue protested the humps, saying 
they would hinder ambulances and police cars trying to respond to emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hate to have my house on fire and lose precious moments while the 
firetrucks stopped for speed humps," said Joseph Beautz. 
</P>

 At least 21 Simi Valley streets have been outfitted with speed humps since the 
devices were first allowed in the city in 1987, and responding to emergencies 
on those streets has not been a problem, according to a report prepared by the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Speed humps are wider and do not jolt vehicles as harshly as the speed bumps 
in many parking lots. SARA CATANIA

 A Simi Valley teen-ager was seriously injured Monday after a large piece of 
carpet was blown into her path, causing her to lose control of her car on the 
Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, 16, was taken to Simi Valley Hospital, where she was undergoing 
surgery Monday night.Her name and condition were unavailable, but the 
California Highway Patrol said she suffered major injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl was driving westbound on the Simi Valley Freeway east of 1st Street 
in Simi Valley about 1:40 p.m. when the carpet flew into her path, according to 
CHP reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Traveling about 80 m.p.h., she swerved left across three lanes of traffic then 
turned back to the right, where she was broadsided by another car, officials 
said. The other driver, Donald Newby, 48, of Lompoc, was not injured. JAN

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; TELLER SUES OVER BANK HOLDUP POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MURPHY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former teller at a Bank of America in Thousand Oaks has filed a lawsuit 
against the bank, saying its policy of giving out as little money as possible 
during holdups endangered her life during an armed robbery a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suit filed in Ventura County Superior Court, Suzanne Schneider said she 
thought she was going to be killed when the operations manager at her bank 
repeatedly gave a robber less money than he asked for during a Dec. 15, 1993, 
holdup. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified robber pointed a gun at Schneider throughout the holdup, and 
he threatened to kill her and two other tellers when the manager gave him less 
cash than he demanded, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint says Schneider later was told of a bank policy to give out as 
little cash as possible in a robbery, meaning that "the lives of bank employees 
. . . were to be bargained away in order to conserve funds." 
</P>
<P>
 News reports at the time said the robbery occurred at the Bank of America on 
Lindero Canyon Road. The robber handed a teller a checkbook that contained a 
note saying: "This is a robbery. I want $20,000 in $100 bills. Don't push the 
alarm." 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider's lawsuit said the manager twice went into the bank's vault to get 
the man cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider says she has suffered from anxiety and panic attacks since the 
robbery and is unable to enter a bank for any reason, even to conduct personal 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that Schneider was denied her request for another job at the 
bank. It also says a bank-paid psychiatrist called Schneider several times at 
her home and demanded that she return to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider is seeking unspecified damages for infliction of emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank officials could not be reached for comment. BARBARA MURPHY

BIOTECHNOLOGY LEADER AMGEN IS RECOGNIZED; THOUSAND OAKS: IN A WHITE HOUSE 
CEREMONY, THE FIRM IS HONORED FOR TWO CUTTING-EDGE DRUGS DEVELOPED IN ITS LOCAL 
LAB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Drug manufacturer Amgen Inc. was awarded the prestigious National Medal of 
Technology on Monday, making it the first biotechnology firm to win the 
country's highest prize for technological advancements. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon M. Binder, chief executive officer of the Thousand Oaks-based company, 
accepted the award from Vice President Al Gore and Commerce Secretary Ron Brown 
and later joined other honorees at a private Oval Office ceremony with 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are true national heroes," Gore told the winners, praising their 
commitment to learning and the boost their work has given to the national 
economy. "The importance of science and technology to our nation simply cannot 
be overstated. Nothing has more power to improve the quality of our lives, and 
nothing contributes more to economic growth and competitive success in the 
economic markets." 
</P>
<P>
 The award has gone in past years to such heavyweight firms as General 
Electric, AT & T Bell Laboratories, DuPont Co. and Microsoft. Amgen won the 
honor for two cutting-edge drugs -- Epogen for dialysis patients and Neupogen 
for those undergoing chemotherapy -- developed at the company's Thousand Oaks 
labs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This award is the first for our industry in its very short but remarkable 
history," Binder said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1980, Amgen has grown into the nation's largest biotechnology firm, 
earning profits of $383 million in 1993 on $1.37 billion in sales. It has 3,200 
employees worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 In praising the award winners, Brown said high-tech firms offer higher incomes 
than companies that have not invested in the latest technology and create jobs 
with their innovations. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen officials hope the honor will serve as encouragement to the struggling 
biotechnology industry. In recent years, officials said, products have failed 
at some firms, investments have slowed to the industry in general, and Federal 
Drug Administration regulations continue to slow development of new drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're quite proud of this and consider it important not just to Amgen but to 
an industry that has made a lot of dramatic breakthroughs but is still 
struggling to be profitable," said Pete Teeley, Amgen's vice president for 
government and public relations. "For us, it's been very difficult, but it's 
also been rewarding. It is a very time-consuming and costly process to be 
successful in the lab and go to market." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Medal of Technology was created by Congress in 1980 to recognize 
technological achievements. Nominations are submitted from the private sector 
and are reviewed by a Commerce Department committee made up of top scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 One of six winners this year, Amgen was honored "for its leadership in 
developing innovative and important commercial therapeutics based on advances 
in cellular and molecular biology for delivery to critically ill patients 
throughout the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The two Amgen drugs are taken by more than 350,000 patients in the United 
States and others around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Epogen, approved by the FDA in 1989, is a genetically engineered human protein 
that stimulates red blood cells in bone marrow. It is used to treat anemia in 
dialysis patients and has eliminated 10% of all blood transfusions nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The second drug, Neupogen, stimulates the body's ability to produce 
infection-fighting white blood cells. Such cells are often destroyed during 
chemotherapy, exposing patients to life-threatening infections. Neupogen, which 
received FDA approval in 1991, helps patients continue on chemotherapy with 
less fear of infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen is already in the midst of developing its third drug, Infergen, for 
hepatitis sufferers, officials said. The company hopes to submit it to the FDA 
for approval in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 There were four individual scientists who won the coveted technology award 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other corporate winner for 1994 went to Corning Inc., whose products 
range from windows for the space shuttle to improvements in catalytic 
converters used to reduce pollutants from cars.

HOME SALES TUMBLE FOR 2ND MONTH; REAL ESTATE: HOUSING PRICES CONTINUE TO FALL. 
BUT ANALYSTS POINT OUT THAT TRANSACTIONS FOR THE 11 MONTHS ARE UP 14.7% OVER 
LAST YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a yearlong rebound, the real estate market in Ventura County stalled in 
November for the second consecutive month as prices continued their stubborn 
fall, according to a report released last week. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, for the first time in a year, the number of homes sold countywide in 
a given month actually dropped below the number sold in the same period the 
preceding year. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet analysts note that housing sales this year are up 14.7% over the same 
11-month period in 1993, indicating that the market has not been appreciably 
blunted by the steady creep of interest rates -- yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the positives that you see in the economy are outweighing the 
negative impacts of the interest rates," said Nima Nattagh, an analyst with 
Riverside-based TRW-REDI Property Data, which compiled the housing report. 
</P>
<P>
 "The caveat is that we are obviously basing our analysis on trends so far this 
year," Nattagh added. "If interest rates continue to go up, I think there would 
be a real danger of a further flattening of purchase activity." 
</P>
<P>
 Distracted by the holidays, people historically defer such momentous decisions 
as selling or buying a house until after the first of the year, so the markets 
cool accordingly, said Bob Edwards, president of the Oxnard Harbor Assn. of 
Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are thinking of Christmas and other things now," he said. "They're 
more interested in automobiles and children's toys." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the year-to-date increase in sales, housing prices have continued to 
slip countywide, dipping from an average of $232,490 per home in October to 
$226,287 in November -- a drop of 2.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, in November, 1993, the average sales price of homes was about 
$7,772 higher than those sold last month. Year-to-date prices in the county 
have dropped 1.9% from the same period in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "One reason is that the supply is still at a fairly high level, and demand 
hasn't reached the point where it will result in price appreciation," Nattagh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason, he added, is foreclosure sales that flooded markets with 
properties that lenders discounted because of their eagerness to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would have an effect of dragging down the values," he said, but he noted 
that anecdotal evidence indicates that foreclosure rates have flattened, boding 
well for homeowners eager to see their properties appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the market is in a healing state," said Judy Hoag, president of the 
Ventura Assn. of Realtors. "But I think it is in a healthy healing state 
because it's not going too fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, 747 homes were sold countywide, 17 more than were sold in October 
but nine fewer than the number sold a year ago. Notable pockets of activity 
were in Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley, Camarillo, Oxnard and Ventura, where 
several tracts are being built for first-time buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "For quite a few years, we had no brand-new housing in Ventura," Hoag said, 
"but when you get new housing, you have to turn over existing housing also . . 
. because people are moving up." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Southern California, real estate trends are the same as those in 
Ventura County: a two-month slowdown but an overall rise, 15.2%, over the sales 
activity during the first 11 months of 1993. Orange County enjoyed the highest 
rate of annual increase: 19.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The region's housing recovery has been led by entry-level buyers who have not 
been deterred by rising interest rates," said Nattagh, an economist. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, according to the report, 53.1% of the homes sold in the six 
Southland counties were priced at less than $175,000, compared with 51.7% over 
the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining housing prices and low interest rates certainly helped first-time 
buyers into the market, Hoag said, but she added that these factors stimulate 
the demand -- and therefore prices -- for more expensive homes as sellers 
capitalize on their equity to move up. 
</P>
<P>
 But increased interest rates loom ahead. On Dec. 7, Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan signaled that he might have to ratchet up interest rates again 
-- the seventh time since February -- to forestall inflation. The national 
average for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 9.25% in November, a jump of 
2.51% from the 25-year low of 6.74% in October, 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, I would hope he doesn't do that," said Mary Hall, president of the 
Conejo Valley Assn. of Realtors.

<P>
 Cal Lutheran University officials are mourning the death of a popular 
professor emeritus who was also a leading national proponent of Esperanto, a 
language based on several foreign tongues designed as an international means of 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
 James Fonseca, a professor emeritus of Spanish at the university, died 
suddenly Friday of heart failure.He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Elizabeth Beale Fonseca, said Monday her husband was a popular 
teacher who was honored at Cal Lutheran homecoming ceremonies this fall and had 
served as grand marshal of the university's homecoming parade. 
</P>
<P>
 "His retirement had just started and we were enjoying it to the hilt," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials said Dr. Fonseca taught at the school from 1965 until 
last May and served as a department chairman from 1980 to 1982. A Phi Beta 
Kappa scholar, he had a Ph.D. in Spanish from UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident of Thousand Oaks, Dr. Fonseca was a member of the board of the 
Esperanto League for North America and national president of the American Assn. 
of Teachers of Esperanto. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times years ago, he said he became interested in the 
language in high school as a means of overcoming difficulties in Latin and 
German. 
</P>
<P>
 Services will be held at 2 p.m. Wednesday at United Methodist Church of 
Thousand Oaks, 100 E. Janss Road. Viewing is scheduled from 4 to 8 p.m. today 
and from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Wednesday at Pierce Brothers-Griffin Mortuary, 101 
E. Wilbur Road, Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The family asked that donations be made to United Methodist Church of Thousand 
Oaks, the Cal Lutheran University Library or the Los Angeles Unit for Recording 
for the Blind. JAN STEVENS

BREAKFASTS IN THE SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re: "Schools in Fillmore Not Yet Serving Breakfast" (Dec. 12). 
</P>
<P>
 The one thing more startling to learn than that small children are sent off to 
school without a breakfast is that our California Department of Education 
"started offering special grants to feed school breakfasts to needy students." 
</P>
<P>
 Since when does our California Department of Anything take on the effort and 
expense of feeding "needy students?" This writer does not remember voting to 
declare that taxpayer-provided school funds should include the cost of free 
meals. 
</P>
<P>
 Your article quotes "school officials" as saying students miss breakfast for 
"several reasons," mentioning four, with only one referring to an absolute lack 
of household money for food. To see the child off to school without eating for 
any reason but "lack of money" to provide food for breakfast is conscious 
parental neglect and no valid responsibility of the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Where is it written that it is the responsibility of the public school to 
provide not only food for thought but food for the stomach?  
</P>
<P>
 Where does it end? At what point does the school system assume all 
responsibility for the failed parent? From whence does such an edict spring?

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In regard to the hubbub brought on by Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems I've missed a chapter somewhere. I thought we were talking about 
illegal immigrants."Illegal" has been lost along the way. Now, everybody is 
referring to immigrants as if that is the same. 
</P>
<P>
 People who founded our country came here to become Americans. They worked, 
learned our language and customs, obeyed our laws and earnestly desired to be 
an integral part of our society.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, they pour across our borders illegally, make demands on us, drain our 
resources and have no desire to be Americans. Instead, they want us to cater to 
them, to their wishes, their health and welfare needs. They trample our laws 
and our flag, prey on our society and insist that we speak their language, 
teach their language and have written documents printed in their language.

HOSPITAL EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors has apparently decided to ignore the message 
from the last election, wherein the voters emphatically registered their 
opposition to government plans to borrow money to expand government's ability 
to provide services that could and should be provided by the free enterprise 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors added insult to injury when they voted to approve the 
$75-million county hospital expansion plan without waiting for the court to 
decide the pending suit filed by Community Memorial Hospital, to determine the 
legal role of a county-run hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 We will remember the names of the board members for the next election. But in 
the meantime, I hope more voters register their opinion.

HIV/AIDS EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read with interest the report quoting Conejo Valley Unified School District 
Trustee Mildred Lynch regarding her attendance at an AIDS education workshop 
for district educators. She is quoted as saying that "teaching that anyone can 
get AIDS is nonsense. It's a behavioral disease." 
</P>
<P>
 I work daily with children and teens who are HIV/AIDS infected, many through 
only the behavior of being born. I was appalled that a trustee of the school 
district would be so lacking in compassion, understanding and information, but 
I have found through my work that these views are very widespread.  
</P>
<P>
 I suggest to Ms. Lynch, and to all those with similar views, that mistakes are 
part of the human condition. Educating our young people to value themselves, 
and to have compassion for those who are afflicted with HIV/AIDS -- whatever 
the reason -- will produce young people who are less likely to replicate the 
mistakes of those who have gone before them, in the spread of this cruel 
disease.  
</P>
<P>
 As I turned to the editorial page to get the address for this letter, I saw 
the editorial on Elizabeth Glaser's legacy. She stands as a now departed 
spokesperson for the millions of people, including children, who suffer from 
HIV/AIDS through no "behavioral" quirk of their own, and, as the editorial 
pointed out, "totally rejected the view (that) this is a disease that strikes 
those who do not deserve our compassion."  
</P>
<P>
 I am surely not the only person who perceived the irony in these two articles 
being published in the same day's newspaper. Those of us who are striving to 
further the battle against HIV/AIDS must have compassion for people like Ms. 
Lynch, who remind us of the importance of this work. There is much to be done 
to educate those who are at risk of infection and to care for all of those who 
are infected with HIV/AIDS.

RECALL PETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I would like to bring attention to the current . . . initiative that is under 
way to recall Ventura City Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of how any individual feels about Ms. Measures, this recall is 
really about taking responsible action in our community.It is about letting 
elected officials know that we remember and still care about those things they 
promised us at election time. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall is about demanding fair and unbiased decisions on issues that 
involve millions of dollars and affect the entire community. The recall is 
really about learning to govern ourselves. If we can't get tough and uphold 
higher standards on our side of the political compact, then we can't expect 
elected officials to do it for us.

MALATHION SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hysteria appears to be the response to the Medfly spraying in the Camarillo 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medfly is not indigenous to California.It entered our state either with 
travelers, by mail or was illegally transported. If it becomes established, it 
will devastate commercial agriculture. We will all pay much more for fresh 
fruits and vegetables, and it will infect home-grown produce. It attacks more 
than 250 kinds of produce. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no "beneficial insect" to control the Medfly. Consequently, 
establishment of the Medfly in California would force pesticide spraying, which 
would kill all insects and jeopardize organic farming. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of minute amounts (1.2 ounces per acre) of malathion in infested areas 
will prevent a much higher use if the Medfly is allowed to proliferate. This 
pesticide has been used safely for over 40 years to control mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
 California leads the nation in total farm production. We cannot afford to let 
the Medfly become established. Use common sense to prevent contact with 
pesticides, but don't let hysteria and fear destroy California's crops.

CAMPAIGN FUND LIMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the Dec. 5 Ventura City Council meeting, an agenda item dealt with an 
ordinance proposed by Councilman Steve Bennett that would have restricted 
campaign contributions to council candidates to a maximum of $100. Steve 
Bennett had won office under a self-imposed limit of that amount. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to refute the arguments for contribution limits, Mayor Tom 
Buford projected a wall-sized display of his approximate expenses in the last 
election. The total amount came to about $23,000. His argument was that he 
could not have accumulated that much money without being able to accept large 
donations. Councilman Jim Monahan complained that Patagonia had influenced an 
election in the past with large contributions to his ideological opponents. 
Both of these points were excellent recommendations for campaign finance 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Greg Carson and Rosa Lee Measures each stated that large 
contributions to their campaigns had not (influenced) and never will influence 
their decisions. U.S. Rep. Barney Frank had an insight into this relationship 
when he said, "Who wants to be an ungrateful S.O.B?" 
</P>
<P>
 The recent bankruptcy of Orange County funds hints at the cozy relationship 
between Wall Street firms and elected politicos who received large campaign 
donations and gifts that may have influenced investment decisions. We, the 
public, will never know. Wouldn't it serve everyone's interest better if that 
speculation would never have to be raised? 
</P>
<P>
 P.S. Only Councilmen Bennett and Gary Tuttle supported the reform measure.

COUNTY PENSION FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County employee retirees recently lost the supplemental portion of 
their retirement payments.Earlier in the year, retirees received from the 
Retirement Board a long, vague and rambling letter stating these supplemental 
payments could no longer be afforded.  
</P>
<P>
 It seems more than obvious that the investment practices of the Retirement 
Board should be investigated. How could it be at a time of steady gains in the 
conservative investments of private citizens, the County Retirement Board 
cannot afford to continue to pay supplemental payments? Could this be a mini 
Orange County debacle?

OIL FROM THE SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerning your article on drilling for oil off Santa Barbara near UCSB (Dec. 
5): You make it look like, once again, the big, bad oil companies are pushing 
around the innocent public so they can reap huge profits. Rubbish. The oil 
companies exist as a direct result of a tremendous consumer demand for energy 
products and the lifestyle they support. 
</P>
<P>
 The article mentions the citizens' defeats, the platforms dotting the ocean, 
the slight smell of oil and the tar seeps on the beaches. Well, the "defeat" 
for some of those citizens was a victory for others. How about the people who 
brought home oil company paychecks that gave them a good standard of living, 
and by spending those paychecks helped the businesses in the area prosper and 
grow? How about the tax money that flowed into state and local coffers? 
Finally, what about the general public who used this amazing product, in all 
its myriad forms, to make their lives better? 
</P>
<P>
 As to the smell of oil and the tar seeps, do not attribute that to the oil 
companies alone. Mother nature has leaked thousands of barrels into the ocean 
since before Europeans arrived. Life still exists in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 One final piece of irony. You mention that four platforms will be removed in 
the near future. This is correct, but please think about this: Those platforms 
were installed 30 years ago and have become artificial reefs teeming with 
marine life. When those platforms are removed, four vibrant oases in the ocean 
will disappear. I can only hope that somebody will come to their senses before 
this takes place and turn the remains of those platforms into marine parks -- 
but I am not betting on it.

PLAZA COMPLAINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to the Civic Arts Plaza project management's request for 
complaints, I have two: 
</P>
<P>
 First, eliminate the private gym for public employees. To construct a public 
employee-only facility for the purpose of keeping public servants from 
appearing obese is unconscionable.I recommend opening this facility to public 
use. High membership fees could be offered to developers and others interested 
in hob-nobbing with government officials during their workouts. The membership 
fees would then be used to help offset the debt created by the construction of 
the Civic Arts Plaza.  
</P>
<P>
 As an option to this scenario, we could pay for city employee memberships at 
any of the local privately owned gyms. I'm sure these small businesses would 
appreciate the extra clientele and not the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, remove and recycle the copper curtain. This would eliminate the 
maintenance and cost of trying to stop the curtain from turning green. To help 
decorate the architect's big blank wall, we should replace it with a huge Nike 
billboard. Since signage regulations have already been ignored to construct the 
plaza message board, and the commercial signs added to every street light 
throughout town, this single variance wouldn't seem out of character. 
</P>
<P>
 The revenue generated from this large commercial advertisement would be 
significant, and could also help make a dent in the Civic Arts Plaza debt. If 
this suggestion seems offensive, then I'd recommend replacing it with a trompe 
l'oeil painting of the vista that we all used to enjoy before the government 
sandbox was constructed.

SHOP OWNERS LOOKING FORWARD TO DOWNTOWN REMODEL; VENTURA: MERCHANTS SAY THE 
TEMPORARY CHAOS WILL BE WORTH THE ADDITION OF OLD-FASHIONED STREET LAMPS, 
EXPANDED PARKING AND WIDENED SIDEWALKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Looking into his store's future, Ed Elrod sees strife, upheaval, disrepair -- 
and ultimately, sidewalk space for little cafe tables. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey," said Elrod, the owner of Ventura Bookstore on Main Street, "the way I 
figure it, no gain without pain."  
</P>
<P>
 The pain for downtown merchants is scheduled to begin this February. Under a 
$3.5-million plan approved by the City Council on Monday, workers will tear up 
sidewalks, uproot bushy trees, reconfigure parking, replace street lamps and 
toss out existing garbage cans. 
</P>
<P>
 In their place, the downtown blocks will get new trash cans, old-fashioned 
street lamps, more street parking, towering palms, and expanded, scored-brick 
sidewalks.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials say the improvements -- stretching along California Street from City 
Hall to the Ventura Freeway, and from Figueroa Street to Fir Street on Main -- 
should spruce up the aging downtown and attract more visitors to its 
mom-and-pop shops and restaurants.  
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, though, merchants expect some degree of chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always concerned about things that inconvenience people," Elrod said. 
"We've found people are so lazy that they don't want to walk two more steps 
(around a construction project)."  
</P>
<P>
 But Elrod also knows that when the crews and bulldozers finish disrupting the 
street and his business this spring, he will be left with wider sidewalks, more 
space for parking and, hopefully, a more attractive look for the whole area.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, he theorized, the new ambience and sidewalk room would even lend 
itself to cappuccinos and some outdoor seating.  
</P>
<P>
 "I love change," he concluded. "I'm not opposed to it at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to spend nearly $2 million on the California Street 
construction work alone. The Main Street improvements -- which are planned on a 
contingency basis, assuming the California Street project does not run over 
budget -- have been projected at $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Bids will go out on the project in January, and construction is scheduled to 
stretch from mid-February through early June, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The project includes the most controversial redecorating proposal before the 
city this year: the decision to rip out California Street's mushroom-looking 
ficus trees and replace them with palms. 
</P>
<P>
 Letters in support of the leafy ficus, penned by residents with fierce 
attachments to the aging flora, flooded City Hall last spring and summer. But 
the council voted to march ahead with the palm plantings, reasoning that they 
would not obscure store signs as the ficuses do and that they would make 
Ventura look more like the oceanside city it is. 
</P>
<P>
 That decision still makes Kris Pustina, the owner of Franky's Place restaurant 
on Main, smart from frustration. "To me, palms are not user-friendly trees," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pustina hopes she and other business owners can hang on during the spring 
construction months, when some customers will invariably avoid the downtown 
because of all the hassles. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, she said, she is looking forward to having her street spiffed up to 
attract more of the tourist trade. "Once it's done, it'll be really great," she 
said.

CALABASAS PRESSING FORWARD WITH PLAN FOR ANNEXATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buoyed by a city study that says the move would be environmentally sound, the 
city of Calabasas is pressing forward with plans to annex the unincorporated 
community of Mountain Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountain Gate residents, who petitioned for annexation, and city officials say 
they hope the move will prevent the Ahmanson Land Co. from turning two-lane 
Thousand Oaks Boulevard, which skirts their community, into a four-lane 
highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's General Plan calls for a four-lane road, while the city's 
proposed General Plan would leave the road as is. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we want to do is maintain our quality of life," said William Bell, a 
spokesman for the Mountain View Estateowners Assn. "And we think we can do that 
if we join Calabasas." 
</P>
<P>
 A public hearing on the proposed annexation is scheduled Wednesday at 
Calabasas City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson Land wants to build 3,050 homes, two golf courses and 400,000 feet of 
commercial space in an area just to the north of Mountain Gate, a gated 
community north of the Ventura Freeway.  
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say the Ahmanson project would negatively affect the area's quality 
of life. Several lawsuits have been filed to block the development. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners association filed the annexation petition with Calabasas last 
April. The city forwarded it to the county Local Agency Formation Commission, 
which must approve the annexation. Ahmanson Land has challenged the annexation 
in court.  
</P>
<P>
 Mountain Gate parcel was to be inside the original boundary of Calabasas, 
which incorporated in 1991, according to city officials. But a former partner 
of the developer, John Hurford, wanted to keep the area an unincorporated part 
of the county, believing that any remaining development permits needed would be 
easier to get from the county. FRANK MANNING

UC IRVINE BOOKSTORE MAKES GLOBAL PITCH ON INTERNET

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's 6:30 p.m., and Michael Kiley, associate director of the UC Irvine 
bookstore, is rushing off to Japanese class. "I need to learn just some 
rudimentary stuff so I can handle orders from Japan," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bookstore has been drawing as many as 120,000 browsers a week from around 
the globe since it began advertising on the Internet. Among its biggest 
customers, Kiley said, have been Japanese academics seeking technical books 
published only in English, and aficionados of Japanese animation art, called 
anime.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Kiley started the venture in April just for fun, his experiment is 
drawing national acclaim and is even helping to set the standard for Internet 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have an excellent format," said David Scott Lewis, editor of the 
electronics industry magazine Hot Off the Tree. "It is one of the best I have 
seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Kiley describes the service as the only on-line college bookstore in the 
world. Books, records, CD-ROMs and sweat shirts are displayed on the World Wide 
Web, a subset of the Internet -- a group of computer networks linking an 
estimated 30 million computer users around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Wide Web offers not only standard text but also color pictures, 
video displays and sound. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCI bookstore's Web venture has not been terribly lucrative yet, Kiley 
said, drawing about $5,000 worth of electronic mail orders a month. But he and 
others see great profit potential for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is doing it now," Lewis said, citing the consortium of computer 
makers, including Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Apple, that recently entered the 
on-line marketplace by offering home computer accessories for sale on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
 Multinational corporations, among them Pizza Hut and Hilton Hotels, are also 
experimenting with Internet advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Students across Southern California are discovering the UCI cyberstore as a 
welcome alternative to fighting over textbooks and standing in long lines to 
make purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua Chou, a student at UCLA, said he shops at the UCI store electronically 
because he likes the easy pace. He can browse through the inventory from his 
computer terminal at home and send his orders by e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
 The store also courts repeat business by offering a 10% discount to e-mail 
customers who pay an annual $10 membership fee. The price break as well as the 
convenience, Chou said, keeps him coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Wide Web is only about 5 years old, and the idea of advertising on 
it is even younger. Companies that do use it typically make presentations 
similar to that of Hilton, which adds color photos to text so that its displays 
resemble magazine pages. 
</P>
<P>
 "UCI's site is very attractive," Lewis said. "I have seen sites that are more 
attractive, but they don't have a lot of content."  
</P>
<P>
 UCI is on the cutting edge, designing dozens of pages that combine text with 
color pictures, graphics and sound effects such as narration and music. A 
recent promotion for a travel book titled "The Big Island of Hawaii" included 
an interactive map that allowed readers to get information about specific 
points of interest on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 "We use it to draw people into the site," Kiley said, "and hope that once they 
are there they will browse." UCI's biggest on-line sellers, technical books, 
typically do not have great visual appeal, he said, but the store hopes to 
attract a potential buyer drawn to the site by travel and other picture books. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI has also managed to market on the Web without drawing criticism so far 
from purists who say there is no room for commerce on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 A heated debate on that topic began in April when a pair of Arizona lawyers 
sent e-mail advertisements for their services to millions of Internet users. 
They were bombarded by thousands of messages from outraged subscribers warning 
them that they had violated the unwritten law prohibiting unsolicited 
commercial messages. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said the UCI bookstore ads are not prompting a similar outcry because, 
unlike the e-mail messages, they have to be sought out. Besides, he said, the 
UCI concept is in sync with the interests of the Internet's technology-savvy 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is tremendous demand for a service like this," Lewis said. "I can't 
tell you how many times in the user groups people ask where to find books on 
certain topics." 
</P>
<P>
 Hiroshi Deguchi, a professor of communications at the International University 
of Japan, shops for books on subjects such as econometrics and set theory. 
Those English texts are difficult to find in Japan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI's selection is excellent, Deguchi said, as is the bookstore's service. 
</P>
<P>
 The other big draw after technical publications is the bookstore's extensive 
inventory of anime, including comics, books, videos, laser discs and CD-ROMs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mats Roger Nielsen has become a frequent UCI shopper since he discovered the 
anime collection last year. Anime, he said, is nearly impossible to find in his 
country, Norway, and browsing the UCI Web site is much cheaper and faster than 
making inquiries to bookstores by regular mail. 
</P>
<P>
 "Living in Norway, regular mail to and from California takes at least five 
days," Nielsen said. "With e-mail, I get answers to my numerous questions the 
next day, even with a nine-hour time difference -- and for free."

INTEL SAYS CHIP GLICH HASN'T LED DECLINE IN SALES; COMPUTERS: BUT SOME 
CORPORATE BUYERS ARE DELAYING PENTIUM PC PURCHASES, AND SOME VENDORS ARE 
WORRIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HELM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although Intel Corp. and some personal computer vendors continued to maintain 
Monday that the widely publicized flaw in the Pentium computer chip is not 
hurting sales, evidence is mounting that corporate computer buyers are delaying 
their purchases of Pentium PCs, and consumers are beginning to take a second 
look. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, investors grew increasingly nervous about the Pentium problem, 
driving Intel shares down $1.69 to $57.81 on the Nasdaq exchange Monday. And a 
new study by a Stanford University computer scientists became the latest 
indication that the problem is worse than Intel has reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The flaw in Intel's flagship microprocessor can cause errors in some division 
calculations. Intel contends that only a few highly sophisticated computer 
users would be affected, but others -- including IBM Corp., which last week 
stopped shipping Pentium machines -- dispute that assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 Many are furious that Intel kept the problem a secret until it was disclosed 
by a Virginia math professor last month. And the company exacerbated the 
problem with what many regard as an arrogant refusal to acknowledge the 
seriousness of the issue or replace the chips unconditionally. 
</P>
<P>
 PC vendors and retailers have worried that the Pentium flap, coming in the 
midst of the Christmas shopping season, would spook individual consumers, who 
have flocked to computer stores in large numbers for the first time this year. 
</P>
<P>
 That does not appear to have happened thus far. "We've seen steady 
week-to-week gains," said David Goldstein, president of Channel Marketing 
Corp., a Dallas marketing research company that monitors retailers' computer 
sales almost daily at this time of year. Goldstein said overall PC sales are up 
32% to 33% from last year, while sales of Pentium-based machines are climbing 
at an even more rapid pace. 
</P>
<P>
 But anecdotal evidence suggests that some potential Pentium buyers are turning 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like we had more people interested in the Pentium before," says a 
salesman at Office Depot, which sells PCs along with office equipment. "More 
people are asking for the 486 now," he said, referring to Intel's less-powerful 
chip. Bloomberg Business News reported that J&R Music World in New York and 
other retailers have seen a slowdown in Pentium sales. 
</P>
<P>
 And corporate buyers clearly are holding off. David Wu, an analyst at S.G. 
Warburg, said large buyers have put off purchases of Pentium computers until 
February, when Intel comes out with its corrected chips. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Smith, general manager for desktop products at AST Research, confirms 
that corporate customers have put off purchases until new, bug-free chips are 
delivered. "Corporate customers say they would rather hold off until January," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, corporations are worried about possible liability arising from 
incorrect work done with the faulty PCs. Intel itself is also facing a number 
of lawsuits from customers who say their work -- and the value of their PCs -- 
has been compromised. 
</P>
<P>
 And two state attorneys general have even jumped into the fray. Connecticut 
Atty. Gen. Richard Blumenthal raised the possibility of legal action against 
Intel if the company does not adequately respond to consumer concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida Atty. Gen. Robert Butterworth followed with his own letter to Grove 
raising a long list of issues, including the question of whether the chip might 
currently be used in areas that affect public safety, such as the designs of 
bridges and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry said it has also 
contacted Intel to examine whether Intel may have misled consumers by not 
disclosing flaws in the chip when they were first discovered in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel spokesman Howard High said the Pentium flaw would not have safety 
implications for designers of large structures, because "there aren't many 
people building bridges (needing) the precision of 9 digits." Intel claims its 
chip only causes errors in the 9th digit of a number.

EPA OKS CLEAN-CAR PLAN FOR NORTHEAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As expected, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Monday approved a 
fiercely debated proposal by a dozen Eastern states and the District of 
Columbia to use a low-emissions vehicle plan based on California's stringent 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto makers have opposed the plan, and EPA Administrator Carol Browner said 
her agency would continue to work for a compromise among state regulators, 
environmentalists and the Big Three car makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Like California, the states are required by the federal Clean Air Act to forge 
plans to lower air pollutants in the broad air basin shared by members of the 
Ozone Transport Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission includes Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, 
New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, 
Virginia and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 California proponents of alternative-fuel vehicles, particularly electric 
cars, have been keenly interested in the outcome of the debate because 
extension of the California plan to the commission states could spread the 
California mandate to 40% of the U.S. auto market. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission plan does not necessarily require electric vehicles, although 
New York and Massachusetts have separately passed laws mandating zero-emissions 
vehicles -- almost certainly electric cars, considering the state of current 
technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto makers have opposed the proposal, arguing that it would make them produce 
a third category of cars in addition to conventional vehicles and cars for the 
California market. 
</P>
<P>
 Many state regulators and environmentalists say they can't cut pollution 
enough without a California-style plan. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, proponents praised the decision by the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 But hoping to avoid delays from lawsuits from both auto makers and 
environmentalists, Browner also announced Monday that efforts would continue to 
find a compromise "49-state car," both for Ozone Transport states and all other 
states besides California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The broader plan still being discussed by all parties would be more cost 
effective and would benefit public health across the country," Browner said.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW GIVES UP A BIT OF LAST WEEK'S GAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Profit-taking after last week's big gains drove Wall Street stocks lower 
Monday, while bonds and the dollar drifted ahead of a key Federal Reserve 
meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican stocks plunged 96.48 points, or 4.15%, to 2,231.11 on Monday after 
peasant rebels in Chiapas launched troop movements that raised the threat of 
war in the southern state. 
</P>
<P>
 It left the Bolsa at its lowest level in five months amid concerns that the 
potential violence will keep foreign investors away. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average, which had gained 116 points 
last week, retreated 16.49 points to 3,790.70. 
</P>
<P>
 Broader market measures also receded. The New York Stock Exchange composite 
index edged down 0.50 point to 250.04 and Standard & Poor's 500 stock index 
dipped 0.89 point to 457.91. The Nasdaq stock market composite fell 1.18 points 
to 727.89 and the American Stock Exchange market value index dropped 0.50 to 
425.73. 
</P>
<P>
 Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 on the Big Board, where 271.69 
million shares changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
 That was far below Friday's volume, which was inflated by trading tied to 
quarterly options and futures expirations known as "triple witching hour." By 4 
p.m. Friday, 479.18 million shares had changed hands on the NYSE floor, the 
third-busiest day ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Market analysts said Monday's minor setback for stocks was not surprising, 
given the recent strength on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers were motivated by desires to collect profits amassed as the market 
advanced over five of the previous six sessions, particularly Friday's surge 
that carried the Dow average up nearly 42 points.  
</P>
<P>
 The selling also reflected some uneasiness ahead of a today's monetary policy 
meeting by the Fed's Open Market Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's policy-setting panel is expected to discuss whether another interest 
rate increase is needed now to subdue the economy to a non-inflationary growth 
rate. Six interest rate hikes this year have been part of the central bank's 
anti-inflation campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In an illustration of the anxiety over the meeting, the bond market didn't 
stray far from its opening levels, with the main 30-year Treasury bond yield 
falling to 7.83%, down from 7.85% Friday, while its price, which rises when 
rates fall, gained 3/16 point, or $1.88 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Monday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Caesars World rocketed 20 5/8 to 65 7/8 in Big Board-leading turnover after 
ITT offered $67.50 a share, or about $1.7 billion, for the gambling company. 
Other hotel and gaming stocks surged, with Circus Circus up 1 3/8 to 22 3/4, 
Grand Casinos adding 3/4 to 14 1/8 and Bally Entertainment up 1/2 at 6 1/4. ITT 
fell 3/8 to 81 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. Shoe leaped 2 3/8 to 19 in response to word that Nine West Group is in 
negotiations to buy U.S. Shoe's footwear division. Nine West rose 1/2 to 26 
3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * One of the session's biggest losers was Cyrix, which tumbled 9 1/4 to 19 1/4 
after the computer chip manufacturer issued a grim preview for the first half 
of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 * Liz Claiborne fell 1 7/8 to 20 after the apparel maker said it plans to take 
a fourth-quarter pretax charge of $20 million to $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mohawk Industries plunged 3 1/2 to 12 after it said its fourth-quarter net 
will be 30% to 40% lower than the prior year's amount. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chiron rose 3 to 78 after its investment rating was raised to near-term buy 
from above average by Merrill Lynch & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for Mexico, overseas stock markets were mostly higher. Tokyo stocks 
closed firmer, with the 225-share Nikkei average rising 107.42 points to 
19,270.85. In Europe, Frankfurt's DAX average ended up 5.88 points at 2,075.94, 
while in London, the Financial Times 100-share average finished up 20.8 at 
3,034.4. 
</P>
<P>
 In the currency markets, meanwhile, the dollar rose against most major 
currencies, although it fell against the Japanese yen. In New York, the dollar 
was quoted at 100.17 yen, down from 100.24 Friday. The dollar was also changing 
hands in New York at 1.574 German marks, up from 1.573.

FIRST-TERM REPORT CARD; CORONA DEL MAR, EDISON LEAD TIMES ORANGE COUNTY 
ALL-SPORTS AWARD COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Newport Harbor went undefeated and won a Southern Section football title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors also finished atop some national high school girls' volleyball 
polls after winning Southern Section and State championships with a 33-1 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 And naturally, when it came time to tally up the points for The Times Orange 
County's second all-sports competition, the Sailors were in . . . second place? 
 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to well-rounded athletic programs in the fall, the Sailors are 
about as well-rounded -- and as good -- as they come. But the more sports a 
school excels at, the better, and that's where the Sailors came up a wee bit 
short. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the major difference between Newport Harbor having the highest 
cumulative score in the county or trailing its cross-town and Sea View League 
rival, Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Kings, for the second year in a row, had the county's highest score 
through the fall sports season, leading the small-school competition with 153.3 
points. And they did it without winning any section titles, which factor into 
the scoring. They did, however, finish runner-up in two sports -- girls' tennis 
and water polo. 
</P>
<P>
 In girls' cross-country, Corona del Mar scored 25 points -- 23 more than 
Newport Harbor -- and added a 17-point edge in girls' tennis and a 14-point 
margin in water polo; that was more than enough to make up deficits to the 
Sailors in other sports, notably girls' volleyball and football, which Newport 
Harbor scored a combined 79.7 points out of a possible 80. Newport Harbor had 
the county's second-highest total, 143.9 points, putting the Sailors in the 
same spot they were last year, before they dropped to sixth place in the final 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll probably get more points out of the boys this year than last 
year (over the winter and spring seasons)," Newport Harbor Athletic Director 
Eric Tweit said. "And the girls will probably be about the same." 
</P>
<P>
 The all-sports competition is designed to identify the county's best 
all-around athletic programs in two enrollment classes: large school (1,200 or 
more students) and small school (fewer than 1,200). 
</P>
<P>
 Consider this fall the first of three grading periods, and at the end of the 
school year, the point totals for the fall (six sports, 240 possible points), 
winter (five sports, 200 points) and spring (10 sports, 400 points) will be 
totaled to determine large- and small-school champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar and Los Alamitos won last year's inaugural competition, the 
first of its type in Orange County to try to determine the county's best 
overall athletic program based on winning percentage, league standing, and 
performance in the Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like a report card and you're getting a report card on your 
school athletic program," said John Barnes, Los Alamitos football coach and 
first-year athletic director. "Very rarely do you get that (overall 
recognition) -- maybe your baseball team sticks out or something. Our coaches 
and athletes were really proud (of winning last year). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to say we have a great football or tennis program, because we do, 
but it takes a schoolwide effort to win. It's something to shoot for -- 
athletics is about competition and trying to do your best, and any school, if 
they want a high-level program, would consider that kind of special." 
</P>
<P>
 Among large schools, the fall leader is Edison with 137.8 points, about four 
points fewer than the Chargers' had last year when they went into the winter 
sports campaign in second place behind Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 And what of Los Alamitos, which failed to win a section football title for the 
first time in four years? Would you believe sixth place with 107.9 points? 
</P>
<P>
 "Being the athletic director now, in the back of my mind, I'm thinking it 
would be nice to win again," Barnes said. "But it will be a little tougher for 
us now in the Sunset League." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos competed in the Empire League last year, but so did Esperanza, 
which finished second in the All-Sports competition last year. Both have since 
moved to the Sunset League, perhaps the county's toughest overall, and joined 
Edison, which finished third last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference between Los Alamitos and runner-up Esperanza last year was 1.4 
points; the difference between Los Alamitos and Edison was 7.7. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the most surprising school near the top of the current chart is Katella, 
which barely qualified for the large-school division with an enrollment of only 
1,213. The Knights were 1-9 in football, but excelled in boys' and girls' 
cross-country and girls' volleyball, and are third with 115.17 points. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what happens when you put all sports on an even playing field. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a look at how Corona del Mar worked its magic and reached 153.3 points 
(rounded to the nearest 10th): 
</P>
<P>
 * Football: The Sea Kings finished 5-6 overall (.455 winning percentage) for 
4.55 points, and earned seven points for a second-place finish in the Sea View 
League. They lost in the first round of the Division V playoffs, 43-21, to 
Villa Park, thus earning no points for the section championship performance. 
Total: 11.55. 
</P>
<P>
 * Boys' cross-country: The Sea Kings went 4-1 in league dual meets (eight 
points) and won the league championship (10). Corona del Mar finished second in 
the section Division III-A finals (16). Total: 34. 
</P>
<P>
 * Girls' cross-country: The team was 4-1 in league dual meets (eight points), 
finished third in league (5), and was third at the section Division III-A 
finals (12). Total: 25. 
</P>
<P>
 * Girls' tennis: Corona del Mar finished its Sea View dual-meet matches at 
10-0 (10 points) and in first place (10). The team reached the section Division 
I final, where it lost to Palos Verdes Peninsula, 17-1 (16). Total: 36. 
</P>
<P>
 * Girls' volleyball: A 9-7 record was worth 5.62 points. The Sea Kings 
finished second in league (7), but lost in the first round of the section 
Division I playoffs (0). Total: 12.6. 
</P>
<P>
 * Water polo: Corona del Mar finished 22-5 (8.14 points) and first in league 
(10). The Sea Kings were defeated by Long Beach Wilson, 10-9, in the section 
Division I final (16). Total: 34.1. 
</P>
<P>
 With a much smaller lead going into this winter than last year, the question 
is, can Corona del Mar hang on? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very young (among the winter sports teams)," Corona del Mar Athletic 
Director Jerry Jelnick said. "We've got kids and coaches that are going to try 
their hardest, but whether we get results or not . . . The fall is a pretty 
hard act to follow. Our winter sports have always been right in the middle." 
</P>
<P>
 Two other schools appear poised to make a run at Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-place Brea-Olinda (121.3 points) again has an excellent girls' 
basketball team and is the Orange League favorite in boys' and girls' soccer. 
The Wildcats finished third last year, 48 points behind Corona del Mar. 
However, Brea-Olinda made up 28.2 points in the winter and spring; this year, 
Brea-Olinda trails by only 32 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Another school that could catch Corona del Mar, based on past performance, is 
Laguna Hills, which finished second last year, 38.4 points back. The Hawks made 
up 23.1 points in the final two terms, and this year, the fifth-place Hawks 
trail by 46.1 points with their best seasons ahead of them; they are league 
favorites in boys' and girls' soccer and wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like our spring sports is always our strongest sports season," 
Brea-Olinda boys' Athletic Director Ron Hampton said. "And we could finish no 
worse than second in every sport this winter." 
</P>
<P>
 Who will lead the large schools after the winter season? It's a pretty good 
bet Mater Dei will make a challenge. The Monarchs are second among large 
schools with 123.12 points, and excel in three of the five winter sports; they 
are ranked first in Orange County in boys' basketball and third in girls' 
basketball; girls' soccer is a top-15 program.  
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs' problem is consistency. They were in second place after the 
winter season last year, but scored only 52.6 points in the spring. That didn't 
get the job done last year -- they dropped from second to eighth place. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison might have enough to hold off Mater Dei and the rest of the pack, 
especially if it gets an effort to match last year's, when it moved into the 
lead after the winter season on the strength of its two soccer teams and its 
boys' basketball team -- which made a surprising run through the playoffs 
before losing to Mater Dei in the section final. The Chargers are ranked ninth 
in girls' basketball, and fifth in boys' soccer; girls' soccer was sixth in a 
preseason poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza might also be a factor. The Aztecs are fourth (108.5 points) and 
boast a top-flight girls' basketball team (eighth), girls' soccer team (third) 
and boys' soccer team (top 15).

MATER DEI CHOSEN AS NATION'S TOP TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After being unranked much of the season by USA Today, Mater Dei was named the 
national publication's No. 1 team Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're almost stunned," Mater Dei Coach Bruce Rollinson said. "We have no 
experience in this. This wasn't something we prepared for. It's another coat of 
icing on the cake. I also like the fact that it gives us national recognition. 
The kids have worked hard and they deserve this." 
</P>
<P>
 Miami Southridge had been ranked No. 1 before losing to Pensacola Washington 
on Saturday night, 16-7, in the Florida Class 6A State Championship game in 
Daytona Beach. Southridge, which had many of its players suffering from the 
flu, dropped out of the top 25 with its loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei (14-0) jumped to second after its 28-21 victory over then-top-ranked 
La Puente Bishop Amat in the Southern Section Division I title game. The 
Monarchs' semifinal victory over No. 8 Los Alamitos moved Mater Dei to 15th. 
</P>
<P>
 Concord De La Salle (13-0), which finished the season as the state's 
top-ranked team by Cal-Hi Sports, finished as USA Today's second-ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollinson said he is aware that the national championship is only mythical 
since there is no national championship tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to take it, though," he said. "It looks good on the resume." 
</P>
<P>
 Will the school celebrate its mythical national championship? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just going to have a great banquet and get ready for next year," he 
said. "The highlight film might be a little longer now." 
</P>
<P>
 USA Today is expected to give Mater Dei more good news today. The Monarchs' 
boys' basketball team probably will be USA Today's top-ranked team when the 
rankings are released. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei had been ranked No. 2, but No. 1 Hyattsville (Md.) DeMatha lost 
Friday to No. 7 Philadelphia Roman Catholic, 71-70. It is believed USA Today 
never has ranked a school first in football and boys' basketball at the same 
time.

INVESTIGATION FINDS BRISENO PROBABLY LIED; COURTS: VENTURA COUNTY PROSECUTORS 
WON'T PURSUE CHARGES BECAUSE EX-OFFICER'S TESTIMONY HAD NO IMPACT ON KING 
BEATING TRIAL'S OUTCOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Los Angeles Police Officer Theodore J. Briseno probably lied under oath 
during the 1992 Simi Valley trial of officers charged in the beating of Rodney 
G. King, according to the results of a little-known, 10-month investigation 
released Monday by Ventura County prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 But perjury charges will not be filed against him because the testimony did 
not affect the outcome of the trial of Briseno and three fellow officers, 
prosecutors said. The officers were found not guilty of most charges against 
them -- verdicts that sparked rioting in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of Los Angeles police, Ventura County prosecutors reviewed the 
Simi Valley testimony of Briseno, 41, to determine if he had committed perjury. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Ronald C. Janes, who conducted the probe, concluded 
that Briseno apparently lied on April 3, 1992, when he told the Ventura County 
jury that he tried to report the beating of King to superiors shortly after it 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors said they decided against charging Briseno with perjury after 
reviewing numerous court and administrative documents. For a statement to be 
considered perjury, it must have the potential to influence the outcome of the 
case, Janes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although this evidence tends to indicate that Officer Briseno lied, proving 
this beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury would be exceedingly difficult," Janes 
concluded in his 18-page report. 
</P>
<P>
 Harland Braun, Briseno's attorney, criticized the report, the Los Angeles 
Police Department and prosecutors in both counties. Ventura County prosecutors 
conducted the review because Briseno's testimony was given in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they've basically done is use the Ventura County district attorney's 
office to slander him," Braun said of LAPD officials. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD Detective James Miller, the internal affairs sergeant who presented the 
case to prosecutors, declined to comment, saying the issue is a confidential 
personnel matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno also was acquitted of attacking King in a later federal trial, but he 
was nevertheless fired by the LAPD for use of excessive force. Some former 
colleagues have criticized Briseno for saying that officers were "out of 
control" during the 1991 beating. He acknowledged that he put his foot on King, 
who later won a $3.8-million civil award from the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno insisted the action was designed to keep King on the ground so the 
motorist could be arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 His testimony was used in the federal civil rights trial that led to the 
convictions of former Sgt. Stacey C. Koon and former Officer Laurence M. 
Powell. The fourth officer, Timothy E. Wind, was fired two months after the 
King beating but later got a job as a community service officer in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 Braun said that Ventura County prosecutors, by concluding that Briseno 
probably lied but declining to file charges against him, are appeasing those 
who believe in an unwritten "code of silence" against police officers 
testifying against one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno has filed a lawsuit seeking his job back, contending that he was 
wrongfully terminated by the department. 
</P>
<P>
 In the testimony that prompted the perjury investigation, Briseno insisted 
that he drove to a police station and tried to report the incident. Unable to 
find the lieutenant on duty, Briseno testified that he let the matter go 
because Koon had filed a computer message indicating that he was making the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 Other officers on duty that night did not recall Briseno returning to the 
station, looking for the lieutenant or reading Koon's message, the report 
found. A probationary officer riding with Briseno that night told authorities 
that Briseno apparently headed directly to his next call after the beating, the 
report said.

 James K. Mattis of Sunland writes:  
</P>
<P>
 I see from today's column that you are not planning on accepting any 
employment that requires Senate confirmation, lest you go the way of Zoe Baird 
for the way you solved your plumbing problem. Very interesting!  
</P>
<P>
 We have a class of people eager to hew our wood and draw our water, and the 
public and politicians are not grateful, but seek to punish them and their 
children. In the Bible, the commandment against immigrant bashing is repeated 
as often as the commandment against adultery, because they both are sins that 
people seem to enjoy doing.  
</P>
<P>
 So Robert Citron's betting strategy may have cost taxpayers more money than 
all of California's illegal aliens combined!? In the spirit of Proposition 187, 
maybe there ought to be a law, to deport the ex-treasurer to the outer 
darkness, and to make all his seed ineligible for any tax-paid benefits, even 
so much as setting foot on public pavement. . .  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 And so on. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Mattis is a man of such strong convictions that he belongs to both the 
American Civil Liberties Union and the National Rifle Assn. He's one of several 
readers who have responded to my column last Thursday contrasting and comparing 
Orange County's $2-billion investment loss with the $600 I spent to fix a 
plumbing problem that drew an initial estimate of $3,200. This was accomplished 
with the help of a licensed plumber named John and an unlicensed, undocumented 
and thus illegal immigrant named Almado. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Mattis may be right about my chances in a Senate confirmation hearing, but 
this wasn't the first time my column has served as a confessional. I've 
previously admitted to the hiring of an illegal immigrant and, unlike President 
Clinton, I've admitted to inhaling (exactly what, I can't remember). 
</P>
<P>
 'Tis the season, so in the spirit of generosity I'll give readers more space 
than usual today and hold my comments until the end. I'll try to be brief, 
because I still have some shopping to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Mason of the Hollywood Hills writes: 
</P>
<P>
 Your gratuitous comparison between your ingenuity with your plumbing problem 
and Orange County's fiscal irresponsibility putting billions down the drain 
misses some salient points.  
</P>
<P>
 First, you pride yourself on the money you saved using an undocumented laborer 
who was standing on the corner and willing to work for $6 an hour.  
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the job went off smoothly . . . convinces you that you were 
shrewd. However, what if the shoring under your house were bad and part of the 
house collapsed? Undocumented Almado would have been long gone, unless of 
course, he got hurt and then you have had medical bills on top of your hourly 
wage. Maybe, he would have dug through a sewer line, a phone cable, or another 
pipe. The licensed contractor is paid to know these things and pays sky-high 
insurance premiums to cover himself and you in the event of problems . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Secondly . . . you ignore a whole range of social issues. Almado probably had 
dependents using our schools, hospitals and social services. If you had not 
come by that day and paid him so generously, how would he and his family eat 
and live?. . . You did not pay any Social Security tax, any state disability 
tax, any unemployment tax or see if any permits were necessary for your job. 
You looked only at your own convenience and your own bottom line . . . In the 
same vein, Russ Compton of Somewhere in Cyberspace adds: 
</P>
<P>
 Congratulations on saving money on your plumbing bill. You were lucky this 
time. What if Almado had broken your water lines when he was digging? Would he 
know what to do? More than likely you would have been stuck without water until 
your licensed plumber could repair it at a much greater cost.  
</P>
<P>
 I agree that the $3,200 estimate was out of line, but that's why you get 
another opinion. I also don't think people are blaming all their problems on 
people like Almado. And who was trying to get something for nothing here? I'm 
sure Almado will declare that money on his tax return too. I'm not against the 
spending of money on illegals for needed services either, but don't blame 
people for being tired of there being too many hands in the cookie jar.  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 From another perspective, David Waelder of North Hollywood writes: 
</P>
<P>
 I share with you the feeling that hubris and a feeling of entitlement have led 
Orange County down a foolish and self-destructive path. However, based on your 
account of the repairs, I wonder if you don't have more in common with the 
people working the angles than you care to admit.  
</P>
<P>
 I toil in the vineyards of the entertainment industry. Although there is a 
general perception that most film technicians are very well paid, relentless 
competitive pressures have driven down wages on many projects . . . It has 
given me a perspective on wages needed in a free - lance market.  
</P>
<P>
 Bear with me as we do a little arithmetic. I calculate that a working 
individual needs about $20,000 to $24,000 per year to enjoy a reasonably 
comfortable life in L.A. . . . I am aware that many get by on much less.  
</P>
<P>
 When you hire someone to work for only one day, you are hiring free - lance 
help. Realistically, a free - lance worker is not likely to be able to secure 
paying work more than one day in two. To earn a living wage, he must earn as 
much in one day as regular contract labor would earn in two. With 250 billable 
days per year, a $24,000 income requires $96 per day. Someone working 
day-to-day must earn about $192 per day just to maintain that minimum standard. 
 
</P>
<P>
 None of us can personally assume responsibility for all the misfortunes in our 
community. However, when you hire a man to work I believe you owe him a living 
wage. When you hired Almado you effectively took him out of the labor market 
for the whole day and paid him only $40.. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Your home is now repaired because you were successfully able to exploit 
Almado's desperation to your advantage. Forgive me, but I don't see much 
difference between your behavior and the burghers of Orange County.  
</P>
<P>
 Now it's my turn. 
</P>
<P>
 To Karen Mason's charge that I was concerned with my "own bottom line," the 
plea is guilty. But if it pleases the court, may I point out that though I 
promised Almado $6 an hour, I actually paid him $40 for four hours of work. The 
$16 bonus might be considered a guilt-resolution fee. My conscience, such as it 
is, may have anticipated the charges of exploitation -- but not David Waelder's 
suggestion that Almado's labors were worth $192. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a risk in hiring a guy on a street corner, just as there's risk in 
playing the bond market and driving the freeway to work. We always weigh the 
risks against the benefits. I'm still not 100% sure about this, but it seems I 
violated federal law in hiring Almado. Lucky for me, this law isn't enforced 
much, so the risk is low. You'd think that admitting it in the newspaper would 
increase the risk, but the INS hasn't come looking for me. When I called the 
agency Monday, I was told that I probably should have filled out "a Form I-9." 
</P>
<P>
 A Form I-9? Just to hire a guy to dig a hole in my yard?

SENIORS DANCE UP A WINTER STORM; SOCIABLE FOLKS WALTZ AND JITTERBUG AT THEIR 
VERY OWN JINGLE BELL BALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A $20 gift certificate for groceries was passed around the table with the awe 
appropriate to a trophy as dance contest winner Kathleen McCalib blushed and 
stammered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was married to a non-dancer for 25 years," she explained. "I guess now I am 
just making up for lost time." She and her partner, Tom Pickler, 75, along with 
10 other couples, had wowed the audience as they waltzed -- and then 
jitterbugged to "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy" and "In the Mood." After the dance 
workout, they grinned and mopped their brows. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very lucky seniors, as long as we can dance," Pickler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though not all the 300 people at the Jingle Bell Ball in Studio City last week 
were dancing, most seemed to consider themselves fortunate to bask for a few 
hours in the holiday spirit.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am so nervous, you'd think I was a teen-ager," said Leona Braunheim as she 
walked into the ballroom at the Sportsmen's Lodge, the first time she has 
ventured out to a party since her husband died almost two years ago. While life 
without her spouse has been hard, she said, the holiday season is particularly 
trying. 
</P>
<P>
 This time of year can be a stressful time for anyone -- shopping, parties, 
rounds of visits. But for the elderly, it is often the lack of such festivities 
that can be the source of stress and even depression, say experts who work with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Many have survived their spouses and friends. Children have moved from the 
area. And, on a limited budget, this time of conspicuous consumption can be 
especially bitter. 
</P>
<P>
 But many Valley agencies have risen to the call, providing a host of 
activities and socials ranging from Christmas craft classes to choir 
performances. Most of the events took place earlier in the month, though a few 
still remain. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gingersnaps, a group of tap dancing senior citizens, will put on a 
Christmas performance at the Joslyn Center in Burbank today. Later, in 
cooperation with local hospitals, the center will deliver Christmas dinner to 
shut-ins. Mulliken Medical will also hold a Valley Christmas party at the 
Sherman Oaks Senior Citizen Center on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we age, we are not as mobile as we were when we were younger," explained 
Maria Jimakas, a Santa Monica clinical psychologist with a geriatric specialty. 
"But seniors still want to be as active and as giving as when they were young. 
This leaves them feeling sad and helpless." 
</P>
<P>
 But, while seniors' physical abilities may be diminished, they are by no means 
helpless, said Jimakas, who has given speeches to Valley senior groups. She 
suggests that the elderly deal with their feelings of isolation by reaching out 
to others. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone is lonely," she said, "even if they can't leave their home, they 
can get the numbers of other people who may be in their same position and call 
them for three minutes," she said. "Or drop someone a note." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, during the holidays, most senior citizen centers close, and 
regular meetings and programs go on hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the bad thing about these centers," said Beth Engelke of the Bernardi 
Center, which will be closed from Friday to Dec. 27 and again over New Year's 
weekend. "They close up when everyone most needs to be around others." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Caroline Kelly, director of Senior Fit, Secure Horizons' wellness 
program, medical providers and senior health maintenance organizations have a 
vested interest in providing activities like the Jingle Bell Ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more than just a nice thing to do for our members," Kelly said. "We also 
are very aware that active people are both happier and healthier." 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the Jingle Bell Ball, Sidney Joiseph, white hair almost to his chin, 
couldn't stop his feet from moving. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fast, fast, slow, slow," he kept saying, trying to encourage shy partners 
onto the dance floor. "It's easy. You just follow my lead." 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been dancing in twenty-some years," he said, his eyes sparkling. 
</P>
<P>
 Braunheim lamented that "there are a lot more women left than men," as she 
surveyed the crowd for a potential dance partner. "The men die first, you know. 
That just goes to tell you, we should appreciate them while they're here." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the 300-people who attended the Studio City party appreciated the 
company in ways other than dancing. There were kaffeeklatsches at the round 
tables as old friends whispered and giggled and strangers exchanged information 
about senior services and the best brunch spots. 
</P>
<P>
 A trickle of stragglers lingered at the buffet, filling up on petits fours and 
melons, coffee and tea. 
</P>
<P>
 And in response to one section of a Secure Horizon health pamphlet advising 
seniors to avoid sweets, which can worsen depression, David Weisser, a party 
organizer quipped: 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, what good are the holidays, if we can't break some of our own rules."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; ANNEXATION PLAN MOVING FORWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bouyed by a city study that says the move would be environmentally sound, the 
city of Calabasas is pressing forward with plans to annex the unincorporated 
community of Mountain Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountain Gate residents, who petitioned for annexation, and city officials say 
they hope the move will prevent the Ahmanson Land Co. from turning two-lane 
Thousand Oaks Boulevard, which skirts their community, into a four-lane 
highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's General Plan calls for a four-lane road, while the city's 
proposed General Plan would leave the road as is. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we want to do is maintain our quality of life," said William Bell, a 
spokesman for the Mountain View Estateowners Assn. "And we think we can do that 
if we join Calabasas." 
</P>
<P>
 A public hearing on the proposed annexation is scheduled Wednesday at 
Calabasas City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson Land wants to build 3,050 homes, two golf courses and 400,000 feet of 
commercial space in an area just to the north of Mountain Gate, a gated 
community north of the Ventura Freeway. Thousand Oaks Boulevard would be a main 
artery to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say the Ahmanson project would negatively affect the area's quality 
of life. Several lawsuits have been filed to block the development. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners association filed the annexation petition with Calabasas last 
April. The city forwarded it to the county Local Agency Formation Commission, 
which must approve the annexation. Ahmanson Land has challenged the annexation 
in court, and the case is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 The 823-acre Mountain Gate parcel was to be inside the original boundary of 
Calabasas, which incorporated in 1991, according to city officials. But a 
former partner of the developer, John Hurford, wanted to keep the area an 
unincorporated part of the county, believing that any remaining development 
permits needed would be easier to get from the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountain Gate residents have always felt like they were part of Calabasas, 
said Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a Calabasas ZIP code, 91302," he said. "When we moved here, we 
thought we were living in Calabasas." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Brown, who is on the city's Planning Commission, said Mountain Gate has 
the right to be annexed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the folks in Mountain View want to be part of Calabasas, let them be part 
of Calabasas," he said. "I don't think the interests of some developer should 
stand in the way of that." FRANK MANNING

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; RESIDENT WINS AWARD FOR HER HOUSE OF DOLLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Burbank resident Rosalie Caruso has dolled up her house for the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Several members of Caruso's 1,000-strong doll collection, including French 
dolls and even a replica of Marie Osmond, decorate her lawn at 721 E. Grinnell 
Drive. It took Caruso three weeks to decide how to place the dolls in the 
Christmas display because she didn't want "three blondes in a row or two many 
short ones together." 
</P>
<P>
 The elaborate outdoor scene won Caruso and her husband, Anthony, the grand 
prize in Burbank's 12th annual holiday outdoor decorating contest. A two-time 
grand prize winner, Caruso also garnered awards in the window display category 
in 1990 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Caruso said the awards have brought her celebrity status in a town she has 
called home for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have no idea how many people come to my home to see the display," she 
said. "I didn't realize how everyone loved dolls -- mainly the men -- I never 
believed that men would like them so much." 
</P>
<P>
 A doll collector for more than 40 years, Caruso in October started cleaning 
and dressing her dolls for Christmas. Many, including her favorites -- five 
identical dolls named "Rachel" -- wear colorful holiday clothes handmade by the 
collector. 
</P>
<P>
 Caruso said her interest in dolls sprang from her love of babies. She has five 
children and nine grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Caruso and other contest winners, chosen from among 26 entries, will be 
presented certificates at tonight's Burbank City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest, held each year by the city's Civic Pride Committee, has grown in 
popularity over the years, said Cinda Cates, Burbank's public information 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Other winners include: Chuck, Cyndi, Douglas and William Spang, 3500 Viewcrest 
Drive, for the most creative display; the Frank J. Licursi family, 1421 Naomi 
St., animation; the Richard Norton family, 513 N. Florence St., window display 
award; 13-year-old Keith LaPrath, 429 Florence St., children's entry; Timothy 
P. Urban, 730 Clybourn Ave., lights category, and the Burbank Hills Estates 
area, neighborhood award. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee members also will give honorable mention awards to Marty and Julie 
Adams, 344 W. Cedar Ave.; Sarkis Sarkissian and Richard Keller, 4136 Hood Ave., 
and Richard and Karla Fritsen, 2001 Richard St. JENNIFER OLDHAM

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY; BUGLE CORPS SEEKS 
DRUMS, VOLUNTEERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Davis seems to have given himself an impossible task -- running a drum 
and bugle corps without any drums. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the money were there, we would buy them," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the head of Sundowner Youth Programs in North Hollywood, he has found that 
getting the help and financial assistance needed has not always been easy, but 
it has taught the 37-year-old risk management specialist a few lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 "One main lesson is that you don't give up, no matter how many times the phone 
gets hung up on you and the door gets slammed in your face," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 His persistence has led to the creation of the Nightfire Drum and Bugle Corps, 
which held its first major practice recently at the Van Nuys Air National Guard 
Base. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 high school students from around the San Fernando Valley and Los 
Angeles County were on hand for the rehearsal, which focused mainly on teaching 
the students how to play a two-valve bugle when they may have been more 
familiar with a three-valve instrument. Drummers in the group have to either 
bring their own drums or use practice pads. 
</P>
<P>
 To make things even more complicated, Davis learned recently that National 
Guard officials will no longer let him use the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem Davis has encountered is explaining to potential donors why he 
believes a drum and bugle corps can achieve so much in helping today's youths 
stay out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't for drum and bugle corps, I probably wouldn't be here today," 
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1960s, Davis belonged to a drum and bugle corps in Sharpsburg, 
Pa., near Pittsburgh. It folded, and it was then that Davis learned what the 
world was like without a corps to occupy his time. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are things I did I wouldn't even want my parents to know," Davis said, 
explaining that he fell in with the wrong crowd and the rising drug culture of 
the 1960s. He considers himself lucky never to have gotten into serious 
trouble, and he moved to Illinois to get into a different drum and bugle corps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was lucky because I knew what was happening to me and I knew what to do to 
get away from it," Davis said. He started Sundowner Youth Programs in mid-1993, 
with the idea of creating more activities for young people so they would have 
an alternative to the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 A drum and bugle corps has a special appeal for him because once youths get 
into it, he said, they can catch an enthusiasm that is very much like the 
runner's high. 
</P>
<P>
 "The drum corps, in a way, is its own drug and its own cure," Davis said. 
"It's such a physical activity that it's virtually impossible to do it if you 
are on some sort of a drug." 
</P>
<P>
 The corps was able to get bugles with the help of the Los Angeles Cultural 
Affairs Department and the Air Force Academy in Colorado. But the drums have 
been more difficult. Drums available from the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, 
Md., cost about $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The group had just one small practice last January, before the Northridge 
earthquake disrupted the organization. The highlight performance so far has 
been at an Irish Festival, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's repertoire includes rock, pop, new age, jazz and even classical 
music, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The drum and bugle corps is open to individuals 14 to 22 years old. Volunteers 
are sought to help with administration, uniforms, fund raising and in tracking 
down used drums. To help the Sundowner group, call Davis at (805) 257-3123 or 
his vice president, Sam Signorelli, at (818) 761-5227. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank Tournament of Roses Assn. is seeking volunteers to work on its 
1995 parade float, "Reach for the Wind." The float is taking shape at the city 
Public Services Yard, 320 N. Lake St., and workers are needed evenings and 
weekends. For information, call (818) 840-0060. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting Involved is a weekly listing of volunteering opportunities. Please 
address prospective listings to Getting Involved, Los Angeles Times, 20000 
Prairie St., Chatsworth, 91311. Or fax them to (818) 772-3338.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; PLANNERS ALLOW SIGN BY FREEWAY TO STAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Calabasas Planning Commission has rescinded its order that Red Robin 
Restaurant take down its freeway sign within 90 days, averting -- at least for 
now -- the spread of the freeway sign war currently being waged in nearby 
Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission, in a unanimous vote, agreed to wait until Calabasas adopts its 
first-ever General Plan, which city officials say is about a year away from 
adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've really cut the baby in half on this one," Planning Commissioner 
Dave Brown said of last week's vote. 
</P>
<P>
 In Agoura Hills, a dozen businesses have banded together to sue the city to 
win the right to keep their freeway signs, which were outlawed in 1985. The 
businesses were to have removed their signs by March, 1992, but have refused. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Agoura Hills has vowed to fight the lawsuit all the way to the U. 
S. Supreme Court if need be. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeway sign owners say they need them to attract business from the freeway 
and that business would drop off at least 30% if the signs came down. City 
officials in both communities say they are just trying to protect the scenic 
beauty of their cities, not harass business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura Hills has banned freeway signs altogether, while Calabasas restricts 
their height. 
</P>
<P>
 Red Robin and a Mobil service station next door are said to compose the test 
case for Calabasas. About 11 other businesses have freeway signs that exceed 
the 42-foot height limit, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earl Soller, owner of Red Robin Restaurant, said he was satisfied with the 
Planning Commission's vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took about a year to get an answer from them, but the answer I finally 
received was the correct one," he said. "The final compromise they came to is a 
good, common-sense conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
 Soller applied last spring for permission to fix the 75-foot sign, which was 
damaged in the Northridge earthquake. In response, the city notified him that 
his sign had been nonconforming since 1977, when the county set the 42-foot 
height limit for freeway signs. The city adopted the county ordinance when it 
incorporated in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning commissioners have indicated that they would not compromise on the 
freeway sign issue, but the commission softened its stance, Brown said, because 
"we got from this businessman . . . a recognition that the sign was 
nonconforming. . . . He agreed to take it down when the city adopted the 
General Plan, and I thought that was a good compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 Soller had argued that under the California Business and Professions Code, he 
had 15 years, beginning this year, to take down the sign. The city maintained 
that that 15-year period has expired, because the sign has been in violation of 
the county sign law since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas, according to Steve Quintanilla, an attorney for the city, was 
willing to compromise because the signs do not pose a threat to public health 
or safety, or property values. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mobil station owner, John Barkhordar, has indicated that he will appeal 
the Planning Commission's decision to the City Council. But city officials have 
hinted that they may be willing to offer Barkhordar the same deal as Soller. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the city, meanwhile, order the other nonconforming signs taken down? 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not at this point decided to take on all of them, until we have a 
clear picture of what our pole sign policy is going to be," Brown said. FRANK 
MANNING

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; COURT EXPANSION CELEBRATED AT EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM

<TEXT>
<P>
 Forty years after Burbank's courthouse was dedicated on what used to be a 
Methodist parsonage, officials marked the opening Monday of a $7.9-million 
addition to the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The city began planning the expansion more than eight years ago with the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors in an effort to deal with a backlog of 
cases and a lack of parking.  
</P>
<P>
 The refurbished courthouse includes new offices for the district attorney and 
public defender, a new Superior Court room, a new Municipal Court room, clerk's 
offices, a jury facility and an expanded prisoner holding cell. 
</P>
<P>
 The remodeled facility also features heightened security systems that will 
allow jurists to hear felony matters on site. In the past, criminal trials have 
been transferred to other jurisdictions from Burbank's Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have yet to set a date for the opening of new criminal court 
facilities, said Court Administrator Evelyn Glenn.  
</P>
<P>
 Judge Marion Gubler on Monday reminisced about the courthouse's former 
security procedures, saying several prisoners actually attempted to escape from 
his courtroom over the years. The remodeled facility will prevent such 
attempts, he added. The new facilities will also allow jurists to deal more 
efficiently with their current caseloads and add more room for judges to hear 
additional matters, Glenn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening of the first phase of the 32,000-square-foot expansion -- funded 
by bonds issued by the county -- was the culmination of the cooperative effort 
between the county and the city.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials fulfilled their end of the agreement when they opened a 
$3.2-million, 500-space parking structure at 3rd and Angeleno streets in May. 
</P>
<P>
 The second phase, which will include remodeling portions of the older court 
structure to meet Americans With Disabilities Act requirements and creating 
additional office space in the basement area, is due to be completed in 
February.  
</P>
<P>
 Monday's ceremony featured the unveiling of a plaque recognizing the 
rededication of the courthouse. In an era of decreasing city spending and 
cutbacks in municipal services, this was an unusual project, County Supervisor 
Mike Antonovich said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project was completed on time and on budget. In today's time of so 
little public funding, it's very difficult to have a new state-of-the-art 
courthouse -- but you have one here," he said. JENNIFER OLDHAM

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; SIGNAL INSTALLED NEAR HUBBARD ELEMENTARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Hubbard Street Elementary School got an early Christmas present Monday, and 
one that may make it safer for children attending classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Capping more than five years of effort by parents, elected officials and 
school administrators, the city of Los Angeles installed a traffic signal at 
Fenton Avenue and Hubbard Street in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and school officials have complained about traffic along busy Hubbard 
Street at least since 1989, according to Tom Swire, a senior transportation 
engineer with the city Department of Transportation. Last year, he said, a 
child crossing the street to school was struck by a car and seriously injured 
near the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubbard Street handles heavy traffic to and from Mission College and El Cariso 
Park, both just two blocks northeast of the elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, many children crossed Hubbard Street to the school at Kismet 
Avenue, where the child was struck, Swire said. But that intersection was too 
close to an existing signal at Hubbard Street and Eldridge Avenue to justify a 
light of its own, Swire said.  
</P>
<P>
 Even though Fenton Avenue was farther away, it didn't qualify either -- partly 
because it didn't have enough pedestrian traffic, Swire said. 
</P>
<P>
 Redirecting all students to a crosswalk at Fenton Avenue and Hubbard Street 
solved both problems, Swire said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that two council members were involved in the campaign also may have 
helped. Hubbard Street divides districts represented by City Councilmen Richard 
Alarcon and Hal Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
 Both councilmen shared the credit Monday, joining hands with children, 
administrators, Frosty the Snowman and Santa Claus in the first symbolic 
crossing at the signal Monday morning. GEOFFREY MOHAN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: USING QUAKE RUBBLE TO HELP REBUILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Out of those ubiquitous roadside heaps of rubble and rubbish -- the castoffs 
and detritus of the Northridge earthquake -- homes for the needy are being 
rebuilt, thanks to Habitat for Humanity and an Agoura Hills construction 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Builders Group Inc., a general contractor specializing in earthquake 
repairs, and Habitat for Humanity, an international volunteer organization that 
builds low-income housing, have created a way to recycle appliances and 
building materials: Salvage the stuff and give it to people who can't afford to 
replace their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kinda neat," said Don Doty, co-owner of Western Builders. "And it truly 
doesn't cost anybody anything. It's no problem for us to take a dishwasher or a 
toilet that has been slightly damaged -- or maybe just has cosmetic damage -- 
and just set it aside, instead of throwing it out. Then, we can repair it and 
install it in the home of someone who really needs it." 
</P>
<P>
 Habitat for Humanity was founded in 1976 by former President Jimmy Carter to 
give needy families a chance to own their own homes, on the condition that they 
help in the construction work themselves. The group uses volunteer labor along 
with donated materials and professional help to build the houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Nanci Mavar, earthquake recovery program manager for Habitat's regional 
branch, said Western Builders is the only contractor to offer comprehensive 
building and repair services to her branch of the organization, which focuses 
on earthquake repairs for the needy in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita 
valleys.  
</P>
<P>
 "We do a lot of the work ourselves," said Mavar, a general contractor. 
"Occasionally, we get a plumber here and there to help, but we've never had 
anything like their offer for help before.  
</P>
<P>
 "The amazing thing about Western (Builders) is that they can help us do 
everything. They have interior designers, soil engineers, structural engineers. 
In this business, you usually have to beg, borrow and steal to get projects 
completed. But these guys came to us and said: 'How can we help?' " 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Habitat and Western Builders have teamed up on more than 40 projects 
in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who work with us, they feel it's great getting these families back 
into their own houses," said Don Nathaniel, the other owner of Western 
Builders. "The families are so very grateful. Even the families' kids get 
involved in the work. It really doesn't run us that much in cost. It's just 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Mavar said Western Builders and Habitat will begin their latest project -- 
rebuilding the red-tagged San Fernando home of a 30-year-old blind man and his 
blind mother -- as soon as possible.  
</P>
<P>
 "These people have been waiting and waiting for their federal reimbursement," 
Mavar said. "They've appealed and appealed, and they still have not received 
it. These people are blind and out of a home. What's up with that? We're at the 
point where we're just going to do it, even though the family doesn't have the 
money yet to repay."

<P>
 The holidays are traditionally the busiest time of year for the FlyAway bus 
service at Van Nuys Airport, and airport officials expect the terminal's 
parking lot to fill up quickly this week -- even as early as Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials recommend that travelers using the FlyAway bus service to Los 
Angeles International Airport have someone drop them off at the Van Nuys 
terminal, rather than parking their cars there.The terminal provides parking at 
$1 a day for about 2,000 vehicles. There is some overflow parking, "but even 
that gets filled up," said Van Nuys Airport spokeswoman Stacy Geere. 
</P>
<P>
 Buses head for the airport every 15 minutes between 5 and 8 a.m. and every 
half-hour between 8 a.m. and 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The FlyAway terminal is at 7610 Woodley Ave. in Van Nuys. For more 
information, call (818) 994-5554. MAKI BECKER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; ROTARY HELPS BOY GET HEART SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tiny Raulito Figueroa of Guatemala City can "smile like gangbusters" now, say 
his American hosts, thanks to open heart surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center 
arranged by a Valencia-based group with financial backing from several San 
Fernando Valley Rotary clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that's special about the Rotary is they have the vision to help 
people," said Cris Embleton of Valencia, executive director of Healing the 
Children, a volunteer group that helps critically ill children from around the 
world get medical help in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualifying for the help is difficult. The children come from a long waiting 
list of cases drawn up from the recommendations of medical professionals. 
Raulito, who is 3 1/2 months old, was able to get the assistance after another 
child with a similar heart defect died while waiting for help. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort to bring the boy to Los Angeles for surgery began about six weeks 
ago. Rotary clubs from Burbank, Glendale, La Canada-Flintridge, North 
Hollywood, Studio City and Sherman Oaks, the district Rotary organization 
covering the San Fernando Valley, and a Rotary club in Guatemala raised $8,000 
toward the effort. "We got the funding together in a week's time," said Charles 
Reinhart Jr., governor of District 5260 of Rotary International. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's surgery on Dec. 8 repaired a hole between two chambers in his heart 
and replaced a heart valve, said Carl Boyer, who has been hosting the boy 
during his visit to the United States. Raulito is expected to return to 
Guatemala around the first of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Embleton, who began Healing the Children in 1979 in Spokane, Wash., attended a 
Rotary meeting in North Hollywood last week to thank Rotarians and update them 
on the recovery. It is children like Raulito -- and the 4,000 other children 
brought to the United States since Healing the Children began -- that become 
goodwill ambassadors throughout the United States, Embleton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what the kids pick up when they come to the United States and feel the 
love here," Embleton said.  
</P>
<P>
 Raulito's story makes a good Christmas story, she said. His mother had four 
children stillborn before he was born, and when his parents learned of his 
critical heart condition, they were desperate to find a way to save him, 
Embleton said. Thirty of Raulito's family members and friends were on hand at 
the airport when Amber Dikel -- a board member for Healing the Children -- went 
to Guatemala to pick up the child. 
</P>
<P>
 Healing the Children has limited funding, but finds hospitals willing to 
perform the surgery and groups willing to help pay the cost. The $8,000 raised 
by the Rotary paid only a nominal cost for a surgery that would cost tens of 
thousands of dollars, said Peggy Frank Shaff, a spokeswoman for Cedars-Sinai.

MAN GUILTY IN SLAYING OF NURSE; CRIME: VENTURA COUNTY JURY TAKES FIVE HOURS TO 
CONVICT MARK THORNTON OF THE MURDER OF KELLIE O'SULLIVAN. HE COULD FACE THE 
DEATH PENALTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County jury, deliberating for less than five hours Monday, convicted 
a 20-year-old Thousand Oaks man of murder and a special circumstance that could 
send him to the gas chamber for last year's slaying of Westlake nurse Kellie 
O'Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Scott Thornton, whom prosecutors branded a cold-blooded killer but 
defense attorneys called an immature and impulsive young man, sat stoically as 
Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath read guilty verdicts to the 13 counts 
he faced. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very upset about the verdict as far as the special circumstance," said 
Deputy Public Defender Susan R. Olson, adding that Thornton broke down and 
sobbed as soon as he left the courtroom. "He's very frightened about what he's 
facing." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they were pleased with the jury's findings and will continue 
to push for the maximum punishment when Thornton's penalty hearing begins in 
about three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's only two choices, and we will be requesting a death sentence," Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most serious charge against Thornton involved the Sept. 14, 1993, 
carjacking and killing of O'Sullivan, the mother of a young son. Prosecutors 
believe he killed her for her car, which he later used to abduct his former 
girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors told the jury that Thornton kidnaped O'Sullivan in broad daylight 
in front of a Thousand Oaks pet store, forced her to a desolate area in the 
Santa Monica Mountains and shot her once in the chest and twice in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Sullivan's badly decomposed body, still clad in her nurse's uniform, was 
found 12 days later by two volunteers who had joined hundreds of others in a 
massive demonstration of community unity to search for the missing woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton had been arrested seven days earlier in Reno, where he was in 
possession of O'Sullivan's Ford Explorer vehicle and a .38-caliber snub-nosed 
revolver, which later was proven to be the murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that evidence, the clean-scrubbed, soft-spoken defendant maintained 
his innocence after his arrest in an interview with police and during a taped 
jail visit with his 68-year-old grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton never took the witness stand, and his attorneys did not admit he was 
the killer until closing arguments last week. Still, they implored jurors to 
find him guilty of only first-degree murder and not the special circumstance 
that could send him to his death. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorneys told the jury that Thornton is immature and speculated 
that he probably killed O'Sullivan in a moment of panic, perhaps as she lunged 
for his gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors called such speculation absurd and urged the jury to return a 
verdict that would make Thornton eligible for the gas chamber. After Monday's 
verdict was read, jurors remained bound by an admonition not to speak about the 
case until after they make a recommendation for his penalty -- life in prison 
or death. 
</P>
<P>
 But clearly, everyone involved in the case was surprised by how quickly the 
jury came back with its decision of guilt. The jury began deliberating about 
9:30 Monday morning. About 4 p.m., the foreman told the bailiff that decisions 
had been reached on all counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Kossoris acknowledged that the jury wasted little time reaching a 
decision, but said he did not want to read too much into it at this stage in 
the proceedings. "From trying cases for 28 years, I never can even predict 
myself how long they will be out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys also were reluctant to comment on the quick verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 As workers from the public defender's and district attorney's officers crowded 
into the courtroom to watch, McGrath questioned the jury on each guilty 
verdict. In addition to murder, kidnaping and robbery, the jurors returned 
guilty verdicts on forgery, grand theft and non-sufficient funds check charges 
-- all crimes committed to aid Thornton's escape from the county after he stole 
the nurse's vehicle, prosecutors have contended. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton was also convicted of using O'Sullivan's vehicle to kidnap his former 
girlfriend and of shooting at the girl's mother during that abduction. 
</P>
<P>
 During the seven-week trial, the prosecution said the defendant needed 
O'Sullivan's vehicle to abduct 16-year-old Stephanie Campbell and leave town. 
He wanted to leave town because juvenile authorities had issued a warrant for 
his arrest for a probation violation and because he had cashed a series of bad 
checks, prosecutors argued. Thornton also wanted to take Campbell with him 
because she had recently broken off their relationship, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell was a key witness against Thornton, testifying that during the five 
days between her abduction and Thornton's arrest, she was afraid for her life. 
Thornton, she said, had threatened to kill her if she tried to escape as they 
drove around Northern California and then to a Reno casino. There, she notified 
a security guard that she had been abducted. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next phase, Thornton's attorneys said they plan to show jurors that 
Thornton had suffered a terrible childhood and hope to elicit some sympathy. 
"It's obviously a very difficult task we're facing now to try and get together 
this young man's life to show what led up to Sept. 14, 1993," Olson told 
reporters. "Anyone who sat through the first phase of the trial knows that 
there was a dysfunction in his family and at school. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a long history of turmoil in his family. He never knew his biological 
father. . . . He had three stepfathers. . . . We're trying to save this young 
man's life. He doesn't deserve to die."

3 TO BE CHARGED IN DRUG DEAL AT TOW YARD, POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Criminal charges are expected to be filed against three men who were shot and 
wounded over the weekend when a drug deal apparently turned sour at a Pacoima 
tow yard, Los Angeles police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariano Meza, 22; Candalerio Chaidez, 24, and Manuel Chaidez, 50, will face 
one count each of conspiracy to sell narcotics, Detective Frank Bishop said.All 
three were wounded shortly before noon Saturday after a gunfight erupted at the 
tow yard in the 9900 block of San Fernando Road near Montague Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop said the dispute appeared to be over a drug sale. An estimated $90,000 
worth of cocaine was recovered at the scene as was an undisclosed amount of tar 
heroine, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had the narcotics and somebody came in to take their drugs," Bishop 
said. "The guns came out and both sides started shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 Candalerio Chaidez was listed in good condition with bullet wounds to his arm 
and chest and Meza was also listed in good condition with a wound to his 
shoulder, Bishop said. Manuel Chaidez was listed in serious condition with 
multiple wounds to his upper body. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are investigating a fourth man, who turned up wounded at a local 
hospital, and has been listed in critical condition, Bishop said. As many as 
six other men are being sought in connection with the shooting. JULIE TAMAKI

POST OFFICE PLAGUED BY HOLDUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICHOLAS RICCARDI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite years of lobbying, the post office here doesn't even have its own ZIP 
code. But now it has another -- and less desirable -- claim to fame: It's been 
robbed three times in the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Postal officials call the number unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent robbery occurred Friday when three thieves made off with 
roughly $13,000, Los Angeles police said. Shortly before 5 p.m., the robbers 
burst into the lobby of the post office in the 9400 block of Arleta Avenue and 
surprised a crowd of people waiting in line, post office spokeswoman Pamela 
Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince said two of the men were armed with handguns, and as they held up the 
clerks, the third robber paced around the lobby and glared at customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbery was the third at the branch since Sept. 12. Now, Prince said, 
"discussions are being had to determine the need for a bulletproof screen-line" 
around the clerks. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince said that the Postal Service trains its employees how to respond to 
robberies and that the Arleta branch has surveillance cameras. Most postal 
robberies, she said, happen on mail routes rather than in post offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, she said, the number of post office robberies in Southern 
California has been increasing in recent years. NICHOLAS RICCARDI

TAGGER PLEADS GUILTY TO FELONY VANDALISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 20-year-old North Hollywood man pleaded guilty Monday to the unusual charge 
of felony vandalism for tagging, Los Angeles County prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaime Anthony Rodriguez admitted spraying or marking "James 129" on 200 walls, 
street signs, curbs, street lights and billboards throughout the North 
Hollywood area between May 3 and Nov. 29 of last year, said Deputy Dist. 
Atty.Mitchel Harris.  
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez is scheduled to be sentenced Jan. 3, Harris said, and could face up 
to one year in jail, restitution and three years of probation. 
</P>
<P>
 What made the case unusual was the prosecution's tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 A felony charge requires at least $5,000 damage. Instead of the more common 
misdemeanor charge -- which carries a maximum punishment of six months in jail 
-- the district attorney's office reached the $5,000 minimum mark by adding 
together the costs for removing the hundreds of tags, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is really offended by these guys, and in the past they've gotten 
minimal sentences and misdemeanor charges," Harris said. "Now we've got this 
one on a felony." ABIGAIL GOLDMAN

VALLEY INTERVIEW; PARKS COMMISSION PRESIDENT URGES RESIDENTS TO HELP OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By L.D. STRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steven L. Soboroff, president of the Los Angeles Board of Recreation and Parks 
Commissioners, has pledged to visit every park in the city with the appropriate 
member of City Council in tow. One of his latest visits -- his 74th -- was to 
Studio City Park in the San Fernando Valley, the area where he spent part of 
his childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer and father of four has headed the Parks Commission since August. 
He also co-chairs Progress LA, a nonprofit organization advising the mayor on 
making Los Angeles more construction-friendly, and is the president of the 
board of directors of the Big Brothers Assn. of Greater Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Thumbing through the 15 blue binders in which he has organized information on 
all of L.A.'s park facilities, Soboroff called his position "the best citizen 
job in L.A." and said that developing the parks to better serve residents "tugs 
at your same heartstrings" as his work with the Big Brothers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "But" he said, "I am not in this job to make friends. I am trying to help the 
mayor save the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Question: You have issued a call to arms of sorts, asking that communities 
take responsibility for maintaining and improving their parks . What, 
specifically, can residents do to make their parks better places?

 Answer: Start a program. Be a coach. Teach a music class. Yesterday I was with 
Councilman Marvin Braude at a park where they have seniors' classes for people 
just diagnosed with Alzheimer's. We were in a big hurry, rushing in and out, 
and we walked into this room where there were 40 people, all singing a song. It 
was so moving. That one experience was for me such a broadening of what the 
word "recreation" means. Watching these people sing a song, it was the same in 
some way as watching a group of kids play soccer or the high school kids after 
school playing basketball. It is all the same. This is recreation. It keeps 
these people going. And this program was handled by one resident who just 
decided to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do residents go about doing something like that? Whom would they 
contact?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The directors of the park. Go over to the park and say, "I have an idea for 
a program. I would like head a program. I would like to participate in a 
program, and that program is chess, or that program is knitting, or it is 
basketball or street hockey." The reason I think most people don't do that is 
because they don't think they are needed or that their ideas can become 
reality. But they can. They definitely can. It has happened over and over. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: As you have pointed out, close to one-third of L . A . 's parks are in the 
San Fernando Valley. What specific challenges do Valley parks face?  
</P>
<P>
 A. They are larger, which on one hand is a blessing. But it is a mixed 
blessing. Because they are large, there are more security and maintenance 
issues to contend with. They are more expensive to run. And there are parks 
located in neighborhoods where they don't want parks. They are so exclusive, 
they don't want the public coming in to use a park. In those cases, I would 
rather sell that parkland to those people. Let them build another house on it. 
Then use those funds to put a park in the Valley where we need parks. There are 
a lot of Valley districts that need parks very badly. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Aren't those areas with dire need for park and recreation facilities also 
the areas with the most serious security issues?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There are problems and great things happening in every single park in L.A. 
And this is just one more reason why community involvement is a must. I'll tell 
you, you can take five gang members and three police officers and the mother of 
one of the gang members, and I believe that one mother will handle those five 
boys better than those three police officers could. So, in large part, I don't 
believe it is a hard kind of security issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, there is a phenomenon happening in our city: Gang members are having 
children. And those children want to go play football and basketball, and the 
parents are asking themselves, "What kind of environment do I want my kid to 
play in?" And in droves, they are breaking away from the gangs. And we bring 
them into these parks. We let these guys run programs, teach basketball, be 
coaches. They need a place to do that. And these activities, this outlet, is 
more effective than surrounding them with police. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You have said that you are angered by constant police and park ranger 
reports of unacceptable behavior. What specifically are you talking about, and 
what can citizens do to stop it?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, I am angered. I may have been better off using the word disappointed, 
but when I see graffiti on the wall at one of our facilities, it makes me 
angry. I don't like visiting a park and seeing needles sticking out of the 
grass, or equipment broken or stolen. These are the things that are disturbing 
to me. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are solutions. In the Valley, already, there are stories of the 
community, the neighborhood, wresting their park back from drug dealers. Not 
the police. Not the National Guard. But the community. That is the answer, 
right there. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What, specifically, can a single citizen or family do to prevent or 
counteract crime in their parks?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Neighbors could organize a Sunday morning clean-up detail, though we try to 
maintain the parks well. I used to go out with the Cub Scouts and sand down the 
benches and repaint them. Basically, whatever it is that people are motivated 
to do, in whatever way they are able to give of their services, there is some 
way for them to be used. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You have said that there isn't nearly enough money or staff to allow our 
children and other citizens to get what they need from our park system.  
</P>
<P>
 A: There isn't enough, not in any city, whether it is Beverly Hills or 
Pacoima. If the people don't care about taking care of their own community, 
their own children, if they don't see to it themselves that they get the 
programs and facilities they need, there is no agency, no outside influence 
that can give that to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are you doing to operate better on a tight budget, and what can 
citizens do to get what they need from a lean system?  
</P>
<P>
 A: What I can do is to make sure that we are run efficiently. For example, 
certain facilities may not be used all the time, like the basketball courts 
during the day while kids are in school. What other types of programs can we 
run there then? We need to become consistent in our activity levels, getting 
rid of those peaks and valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 On the citizen side, we need neighborhood input in order to do this 
effectively. What do they need? What is offered that they would attend if only 
it were at a different time? And we need volunteers. Of course we are too 
short-staffed to do everything everyone needs or wants. But if residents 
volunteer to accomplish things that are important to them or their communities, 
just about anything is possible, regardless of the city budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You are calling on the private sector to assume more responsibility for the 
community's recreation facilities. Do you think that government needs to be 
relieved of that responsibility?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think the private sector has a lot to benefit by participating, but I 
don't believe that the parks should be controlled privately. The private sector 
has an integral role in filling wish lists in neighborhood after neighborhood, 
whether it is buying ballet equipment or fixing the swings. 
</P>
<P>
 And when we ask people to give to the city for playgrounds and parks, it 
doesn't have to come out of their philanthropic budget. It can come out of 
their advertising and promotion budget. We can give people cluck for their 
buck. God willing, someone reading this article says, "I want to build a 
children's playground in my neighborhood, and call it whatever, or say it was a 
gift from this." We can do that. If someone wants to put new basketball hoops 
up, or build some chess or checkers tables, if they want to improve their 
neighborhood park financially, we can and will go around the entire 
bureaucratic process, as long as it is up to codes, to get immediate 
installation. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We are nearing the one-year anniversary of the Northridge quake. Have the 
parks had any special role or needs in the rebuilding of the city over the last 
year?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Obviously, immediately after the earthquake, the parks were an integral 
part of the healing process and the emergency progress. Our people worked 24 
hours a day, creating places for people to go, safe places. Certainly they were 
instrumental in the sanity of people after such a horrifying experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Future-wise, I would consider earthquake training classes to be as important 
recreationally as anything else we may promote at our facilities.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; NEW CITY HALL WORKWEEK HIKES EFFICIENCY, 
REPORT SAYS; SANTA CLARITA: LONGER HOURS AND ALTERNATING FRIDAYS OFF LEAD TO 
PRODUCTIVITY GAINS, FEWER SICK DAYS. SKEPTICS QUESTION WHETHER RESIDENTS' NEEDS 
ARE BEING MET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A work schedule that gives city employees every other Friday off has resulted 
in a rise in productivity with less time lost in sick days and less overtime, 
according to a recent city report. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cost savings to the city, projected at $42,500 a year, still has not 
settled a debate over how many days Santa Clarita City Hall should be open each 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The current work schedule went into effect in March, with employees working 80 
hours over nine days rather than 10. It was part of Santa Clarita's efforts to 
meet South Coast Air Quality Management District standards, which require 
businesses with 100 or more employees to reduce their car trips to work by 
encouraging car-pooling, the use of public transportation and bicycling. 
</P>
<P>
 A study of the new program showed that in comparison with May through October 
last year, city employees this year took an average of 4.5 fewer hours of sick 
leave, a 21% reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Other businesses and agencies that have switched to such modified schedules 
have also shown a reduction in sick time, said Assistant City Manager Ken 
Pulskamp. "This information is not unusual," he said. "We thought we might (see 
savings). It's just a positive byproduct." 
</P>
<P>
 No comparisons are available for overtime due to the countless additional 
hours accrued following the Northridge earthquake. However, city personnel 
officials believe there have been similar savings. 
</P>
<P>
 When City Council members initially discussed the modified schedule, some 
officials feared that closing city offices every other Friday would create the 
illusion that employees are putting in fewer hours. Others noted that air 
quality isn't being improved if city employees drive on their day off. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the skeptics were not swayed by the new study. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people expect people to be at City Hall," said Councilwoman Jan Heidt. 
"If you're off on Friday, you're not sitting at home not using your car." 
</P>
<P>
 Heidt has directed personnel officials to suggest alternatives to the 
staggered work schedule. A report on those proposals will be presented to the 
council Jan. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Also next month, surveys will be placed on public counters at City Hall asking 
residents if current City Hall hours are meeting their needs, Pulskamp said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time Santa Clarita has operated on a compressed 
workweek. From January, 1992, to January, 1994, city workers were given every 
other Monday off, but schedules were staggered so each department was 
half-staffed, theoretically allowing employees to cover for one another. 
</P>
<P>
 However, department heads said residents had difficulty contacting city 
employees, productivity dropped as employees covered for absent colleagues and 
staff meetings were difficult to schedule.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; POST-QUAKE USE SPEEDS NEED FOR ROAD'S REPAIR

 A formerly obscure stretch of road that was the lifeline for hundreds of 
thousands of north county commuters after the earthquake is getting some needed 
TLC for the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans workers began resurfacing a stretch of Sierra Highway on Monday that 
for several days following the Northridge earthquake was the only link between 
Los Angeles and residents of the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 Resurfacing is routine for all roads, but the heavy use of Sierra Highway 
necessitated the work be performed sooner than planned, said Russell Snyder, a 
Caltrans spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened after the quake was there was a lot of traffic detoured onto 
Sierra Highway, and all that traffic really does beat up the road," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A resurfacing date had not been set before the earthquake, but "was not 
planned this year or the next," said Robert Newman, supervising civil engineer 
for the city of Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days following the earthquake, which caused portions of the Golden 
State and Antelope Valley freeways to collapse, commuters were sometimes backed 
up for more than 10 miles on Sierra Highway. Commutes that took 45 minutes 
before the disaster took up to five hours, prompting many residents to head for 
work at 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The road will be rebuilt between Placerita Canyon Road in Santa Clarita and 
the Los Angeles city limits, the portion to which traffic was diverted, Snyder 
said. Estimated cost of the project is $587,000, which will be paid by Federal 
Highway Administration funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The road will remain partially open during the two-week project. The repairs 
are scheduled to be completed by Dec. 31 if weather is favorable.

DEAL CLEARS WAY FOR NEW CAL STATE NEAR CAMARILLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lemon grower Monday said he has agreed to sell 200 acres near Camarillo to 
the California State University system, clearing a hurdle that has blocked 
Ventura County from building a public university for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State officials have scheduled a news conference for this morning to 
announce details of the agreement after they inform the Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors of the breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
 If the sale goes through as planned, it would be the first time Cal State 
officials have been able to acquire land for a Ventura County campus in more 
than 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past eight years, university officials have tried to buy two other 
parcels in the county for a campus. But local opposition forced them to back 
away from those deals, making the county the largest in the state without a 
public four-year college. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the break we've been looking for," said Peter MacDougall, chairman of 
an advisory committee of volunteers pushing for a local state university. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Mohseni, whose family owns 200 acres west of Camarillo, said he is 
pleased with the transaction, despite a condemnation suit filed against him by 
Cal State officials to acquire the land. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy to be contributing in a small way to Ventura County being able to 
get a four-year university after 10 or 12 years of effort by the state 
college," Mohseni said. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal calls for the state to acquire 200 acres owned by the Mohseni Ranch 
off Central Avenue, and a neighboring 60-acre parcel owned by Sakioka Farms, 
Mohseni said. Specific terms of the deal were to be disclosed today. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohseni Ranch, which owns roughly four-fifths of the 260-acre site, had 
refused to sell for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce M. Kennedy, longtime director of the Ventura satellite campus of Cal 
State Northridge, said this morning's announcement will be "a wonderful 
Christmas present." She has worked for years to expand the Cal State Northridge 
Ventura campus to a four-year university. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature has set aside more than $5 million to acquire property for a 
Cal State campus in Ventura County, Kennedy said.

LONG BEACH OFFERS TO PAY $375,000 IN BEATING CASE; LAW: OFFICIALS REACH 
TENTATIVE AGREEMENT WITH BROTHERS WHO SAID POLICE STRUCK AND KICKED THEM IN 
1986 INCIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Long Beach officials have tentatively agreed to pay $375,000 to two brothers 
who said they were handcuffed, beaten and kicked in the driveway of their home 
by police officers investigating a noise complaint nearly nine years ago, it 
was announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement came Thursday after a Superior Court jury in Long Beach found 
the city and officers liable for damages in the incident involving residents 
Guillermo Irigoyen, 50, and his brother, Juan, 43. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury had resumed deliberations to set monetary damages when the two sides 
reached a tentative agreement, which is to be submitted today to the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men suffered injuries to their heads, backs and arms as a result of 
the beatings in June, 1986, according to the complaint, which said they have 
needed continuous psychiatric care since.  
</P>
<P>
 The clash occurred about midnight after police arrived at the Irigoyens' home 
to investigate a disturbing-the-peace call. Officers Phil Candelaria and James 
Creager apparently approached the house's open garage, where the two men were 
listening to music. The policemen did not identify themselves, according to the 
suit. The attorney for the brothers described the uniforms the officers wore as 
ink blue and difficult to see in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 Unaware that the approaching men were officers, Guillermo threatened them with 
a bottle and ordered them off his property. The officers then apprehended the 
brothers, handcuffed them and threw them to the ground. The brothers were 
struck with batons and kicked, according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irigoyens were arrested and charged with assaulting a police officer, 
resisting arrest, public intoxication and disturbing the peace. They pleaded no 
contest to disturbing the peace and paid a fine. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint was filed against the city and the officers shortly after the 
incident, but it was stalled after the brothers' first attorney was 
unexpectedly disbarred on an unrelated matter, said attorney Scott F. Craig, 
who took over the case in 1990.  
</P>
<P>
 The officers also were accused in the complaint of illegally searching the 
Irigoyens' home and filing false police reports about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Atty. Robert Shannon said he could not comment on the award 
because the Long Beach City Council had not approved it. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither officer could be reached for comment. Candelaria still works as a 
police officer for the city. Creager is a detective in Vancouver, Wash., a Long 
Beach Police Department spokeswoman said.

WORK OF PANEL PROBING FIRE DEPT. PUT ON HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. LOPEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The work of an independent panel appointed to study affirmative action issues 
in the Los Angeles Fire Department in the wake of a scathing city audit has 
been put on hold because officials have already begun to address the concerns 
raised in the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the audit was released last month, the City Council Personnel Committee 
and the Fire Commission have held several hearings on alleged discrimination in 
the department's training and promotion practices, and treatment of women and 
minorities.The department also has expanded an existing committee to adopt 
recommendations in the audit. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, it doesn't make sense to have us replicating the efforts," 
said Los Angeles attorney Gilbert T. Ray, who is heading the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 A sharply divided Fire Commission approved the panel Nov. 22 at the request of 
board President Elizabeth Lowe, who called for the action after being told by 
Fire Chief Donald O. Manning that the audit's findings were inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning has dismissed the Personnel Department audit as a "hatchet job" based 
on unscientific methodology and the grumblings of a few firefighters. He put 
forth his own report containing data that he said contradicted the audit. 
</P>
<P>
 But in preliminary observations, Ray's panel found that the audit -- although 
not an exhaustive analysis -- did provide useful information about perceived 
discrimination problems on the 3,100-member force. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fire Department's own report is useful in supplying some explanations and 
some selected statistics in rebuttal to the Personnel Department report, but it 
too is not, and does not purport to be, a comprehensive or in-depth treatment 
of the issues," Ray said in a letter that will be discussed today at a Fire 
Commission meeting.

VACANCY RATE FOR COMMERCIAL SPACE DROPS DURING '94 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This has been a turnaround year for Ventura County business, as vacancy rates 
of industrial parks and office buildings have dropped to pre-recession lows and 
foreclosures have leveled off for the first time since 1990, analysts reported 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake, which prompted some Los Angeles County businesses 
to head north, along with the continued lure of the county's quality of living 
led to significant boosts in business activity this year, the analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the earthquake, industrial, commercial and retail activity 
surpassed levels last seen in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a superb year," said William Kiefer of Grubb & Ellis Co., the 
Oxnard-based firm that prepared the year-end report. "We've really seen a 
tremendous boost all the way around." 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of vacant office space, a strong indicator of business growth, 
showed a decline from 24% in 1993 to 16.4% for 1994. Similarly, vacant 
industrial space dropped from 12.5% in 1993 to 7.7% this year, and retail 
vacancies declined from 9.3% to 7.9% over the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more startling, retail business consultant Bruce Boring Sr. said, is the 
drastic increase in mega-stores, such as Target and Wal-Mart, expected to occur 
over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about a 20% increase in the market," Boring said. "We've got a 
lineup of large retail tenants that want to come into the county." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the large retail chains, the county has seen an influx in 
factory outlet malls, with one new mall in Oxnard and another under 
construction in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The malls -- traditionally situated away from urban areas -- are apparently 
experimenting with stores in larger communities, Boring said. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the arrival of large retailers and factory outlets may be positive, 
but Boring said the mega-stores come at a price. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are only so many people in the county, and the people make only so much 
money," he said. "So the arrival of these stores will probably come at the 
expense of the smaller tenants." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the county has seen indications that smaller, independent retail 
stores are suffering. Shopping centers with super stores as anchors had a 
vacancy rate of only 6%, while centers without a major anchor store posted a 
15% vacancy rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities such as Thousand Oaks and Oxnard, which are working on plans to rebuild 
aging downtown areas, will have to come up with new attractions to draw 
shoppers, Boring said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said this would mean drawing restaurants and entertainment to downtown 
areas, much as Thousand Oaks has started to do with the new Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 If cities fail to bring attractions to their downtowns, Boring said the 
outcome could be disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cities are going to have to do something, otherwise they're going to end up 
with downtown areas that look like Beirut," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for office and industrial space, Grubb & Ellis analysts said Monday they 
expect to see low vacancies eventually lead to higher rents and to an increase 
in construction. 
</P>
<P>
 But new facilities might be a year or two down the road because construction 
loans remain limited, analyst Kiefer said. Cities can expect to see developers 
begin lining up with office projects sometime in 1995, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the positive economic news, analysts announced that foreclosures 
leveled off this year for the first time since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Although mortgage lenders foreclosed on 1,681 residential and commercial 
properties in the county -- a record high -- the rate of increase was minimal, 
according to TRW REDI Property Data. 
</P>
<P>
 "Against a backdrop of (an) improving economy and real estate market 
conditions in California, foreclosures have stabilized," market analyst Nima 
Nattagh said. 
</P>

VENTURA COUNTY ROUNDUP: SIEMENS SOLAR PANELS POWER NATIONAL TREE LIGHTS

<P>
 Solar panels produced by Oxnard-based Siemens Solar Industries are helping 
power the lights on the National Christmas Tree in Washington that President 
Clinton and his family recently lit. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a solar demonstration coordinated by the Department of Energy and 
the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Siemens and two other manufacturers 
are providing arrays to generate about 15% of the tree's energy needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies are also helping supply solar power for the Pageant of Peace 
festival on the Washington Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Park Service, which coordinates the festival, required that solar 
modules manufactured in the United States be used and that the arrays be 100% 
reliable. 
</P>
<P>
 Siemens donated 28 of its M55 photovoltaic modules for the event. The other 
firms, Solarex Inc. and ASE America, donated some solar-powered units as well. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Energy Department, the cost of photovoltaic systems has 
declined more than 300% since 1982, while the world market for the systems is 
growing at a rate of 20% annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Siemens, part of the German multinational Siemens Solar Group, says it is the 
world's largest supplier of solar cells and modules.

VENTURA COUNTY ROUNDUP: AG LAND TO PLANT OAKS AT AHMANSON RANCH

<P>
 Ag Land Services, a Somis company, has been retained to conduct a 
reforestation program on the site of the proposed Ahmanson Ranch development in 
southeastern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm will plant and maintain 2,000 young oaks in the development area.The 
program is designed to offset natural problems affecting trees' survival. 
</P>
<P>
 The project "is possibly the largest on-site acorn-to-oak tree-planting 
program in Ventura County's history," said Stan Roberts, an Ag Land official. 
In addition to planting and maintaining the trees, the firm will be responsible 
for installing an irrigation system. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-foot-tall trees being planted were grown from acorns taken from 
existing mature oaks on the Ahmanson Ranch, Roberts reported. "The acorns are 
obviously adapted to the local environment and genetically stronger," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The preservation and replenishment program was launched last year when 100 
trees were planted as a pilot project. "We learned how to deal with protecting 
the young tree roots from predatory rodents, and the importance of keeping the 
soil moist," said Gil Nielsen, senior vice president of Ahmanson Land Co., 
owner of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The company hopes to build a large mixed-use development on the site.

VENTURA COUNTY ROUNDUP: GRIFFIN INDUSTRIES GETS LOAN FOR AFFORDABLE HOMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Griffin Industries has received a $700,000 loan from Simi Valley's federal 
earthquake aid funds to build affordable housing in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin was founded in 1993 by Paul E. Griffin III, a fifth-generation member 
of a home-building family. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it will downsize the density now approved by the city's 
General Plan for a 45-acre site from 640 units to 416 units. The project in 
western Simi Valley will consist of single-family homes priced from $120,000 to 
$160,000. Construction will start in September, with units due to go on the 
market by spring, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard E. Niec, a Griffin senior vice president, praised city officials for 
helping the firm launch the project. Griffin has also received $3.7 million in 
financing from Great Western Bank for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley officials contacted the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development several months ago seeking permission to use some of the city's 
$5.5 million in earthquake assistance money to help Griffin purchase land for 
an affordable housing project. HUD approved the request in September.

 Benton Oil & Gas Co. has decided to move its headquarters from Oxnard to 
Carpinteria. The company will occupy most of a 25,000-square-foot building in 
the Santa Barbara County community. 
</P>
<P>
 Benton, an independent exploration and production firm, will relocate in 
February mainly because it needs more room for its administrative operations, 
the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Doll, a broker who negotiated the lease for the Carpinteria facility, 
said Benton will sublease its present office space on the 11th and 12th floors 
of the Union Bank Building in Oxnard's Financial Plaza. Doll is a broker with 
Grubb & Ellis Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Benton, whose stock is traded on Nasdaq, has domestic operations in the Gulf 
Coast region of Louisiana and overseas operations in eastern Venezuela and 
western Siberia in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 To help finance its domestic activities, the company recently sold some of its 
domestic holdings to Tenneco Ventures, a unit of Tenneco Gas.
