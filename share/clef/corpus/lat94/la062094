 SAFE BET: Paul Xanthos, who led Pierce College to 23 conference tennis 
championships in 28 years, is picking the top seeds -- Pete Sampras and Steffi 
Graf -- to win the prestigious Wimbledon tournament, which begins today. Way to 
go out on a limb, Paul. . . . "Sampras' confidence level is much higher than 
it's ever been," Xanthos said, "and Steffi is just too strong on grass." 
</P>
<P>
 HATE DEBATE: It seemed like a good idea: Make it a crime to distribute 
literature advocating violence against someone based on their race, religion, 
sex or national origin. But Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) withdrew his 
bill after booksellers argued that such a ban might prevent them from selling 
such classics as John Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Wrath" (B1). 
</P>
<P>
 RING LESSONS: You might think that teaching gang members to box is a bit like 
giving nuclear weapons to Saddam Hussein. But the tattooed young men who come 
to the Jet Center gym in Van Nuys learn something else: discipline (B1). . . . 
Their main teacher is William (Blinky) Rodriguez, above, who also is one of the 
architects of the Valley peace treaty between Latino gangs that has held for 
seven months. 
</P>
<P>
 SHAKY FUTURE: Although a Red Cross disaster relief center was being built in 
Lancaster to withstand the Big One along the San Andreas Fault, it couldn't 
stand up to the Lancaster City Council (B6). . . . The council rejected the 
agency's request for $100,000 to finish the project, leaving Red Cross 
officials scrambling for funds. 
</P>
<P>
 PEOPLE'S CHOICE: You'll recall the recent fuss over movie theater popcorn when 
a study concluded that it's loaded with fat -- more than twice the daily 
recommended total. But while theaters nationwide suffered a quick drop in 
sales, Universal City's Cineplex Odeon says patrons told them to stick with the 
same fat-filled variety. . . . "It didn't really matter to people," said Marlon 
Linares, assistant manager for concessions.

 TERRIFIC TURF: You may have missed it on TV, but Saturday's U. S.-Switzerland 
soccer match had extensive roots from Ventura County. . . . Pacific Sod in 
Camarillo grew the lush carpet of grass for the Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich. 
World Cup officials insist on natural grass for matches, and this is the first 
time that they've been played indoors. The trick was developing a 
shade-tolerant grass that lasts for weeks without sunlight. Said Pacific Sod 
ranch manager Earl Slack: "It's holding up quite well." 
</P>
<P>
 HAMMER FALLS: No matter how vicious the political campaign, most vanquished 
primary opponents wind up supporting their party's nominee. Not so for Robert 
K. Hammer. He was beaten by Richard Sybert, a former aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, 
in the Republican race for a Thousand Oaks congressional seat. Asked if he'd 
support Sybert, Hammer dashed off a note: "While I will give the devil his due 
and the 15 minutes of fame he will demand, the man fresh from Sacramento will 
receive no endorsement from this camp; nor, given the way that campaign was 
run, can he legitimately expect one." 
</P>
<P>
 FLYING LOW: It's a bird. . . . It's a plane. . . . No, it's an Ecomobile. 
Ventura resident Alan Hurt saw the flying Bubble Bike on TV and had to get one. 
It set him back about $60,000. But he loves it more than any other motorcycle 
in his collection. A retired Swiss pilot designed the Eco, encapsulating a 
two-seat BMW motorcycle with fiberglass. The bike can zoom to 160 m.p.h. and 
has retractable wheels that drop down for balance during stops. When they're 
up, he said, "it is like flying an airplane at a really low altitude." 
</P>
<P>
 FARM TALK: As far as support groups go, this one's pretty down to earth. Local 
members of California Women for Agriculture often chat about carrots or gab 
about grapefruit over lunch. . . . Now, the chapter wants to teach city folks 
about food production (B1). Said chapter president Donna Pinkerton: "We want 
kids to know that it's not as simple as 'Mama, I want some milk, so let's go to 
the grocery store.' "

JACK SMITH: GLITCHES IN GADGETS ZAP HIM OF FAITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Jack Smith

<TEXT>
<P>
 When I was a kid, we had telephones and radios, 20th-Century wonders that made 
us think we had gone about as far as we could go. 
</P>
<P>
 Today we are in an advanced technological age and directly in the path of 
something called the information superhighway. I don't know what the 
superhighway is, exactly, but I don't want to be standing there when it comes, 
if it isn't already here. 
</P>
<P>
 I sometimes wonder what life would be like if it were not for television. I 
think of the hundreds, no, thousands of books I might have read instead of 
sitting dumbly in front of the tube watching sex and violence and listening to 
babbling politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 I think of the thousands of conversations my wife and I might have had were it 
not for that constant assault from the tube. How many tens of thousands of ads 
have we meekly absorbed? 
</P>
<P>
 These miracles are by no means foolproof. We are all vulnerable to their 
frailties. I have just been through an utterly demoralizing week of 
intimidation and rebellion by my electronic aides. 
</P>
<P>
 First, my computer crashed. I am almost helpless without it. A column I had 
written for The Times was lost in the crash. I rewrote it on my wife's machine, 
but her modem didn't work, so I tried to fax it to The Times. They didn't 
receive it. Finally my wife had to drive it in to The Times, as she used to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, my computer sits in the shop, being worked on at $150 an hour. I 
had lost not only that column, but also all the others I had written in the 
last couple of years. My son programmed my wife's computer so I could write 
letters and postcards on it, but I can't make it work. So my mail piles up 
unanswered.  
</P>
<P>
 That isn't all. We have seven telephones in our house, including one portable. 
A week or so ago, they all went dead. We called the phone company. They said it 
would cost $45 for the first 15 minutes and $16 for every 15 minutes after 
that. We told them to go ahead. You can't live without a telephone. The 
repairman worked two or three hours but said he was charging us only for the 
first 30 minutes since the trouble was outside the house. However, the phone 
lines were mixed up. My son spent most of a Sunday straightening them out. 
</P>
<P>
 Then my answering machine went crazy. It answered after I had already picked 
up the phone, repeating that inane message: "Hello. This is Jack. If you want 
to leave a message wait for the tone." 
</P>
<P>
 I was listening to KOCE one night during a fund-raising pitch. They said if 
you pledged $100 they would send you, free, a VCR-Plus, one of those machines 
that supposedly make it easy to tape a program. I spent one entire day working 
with it and have never gotten it to tape a program yet.  
</P>
<P>
 The other night my daughter-in-law Jacqueline brought by a young woman who 
demonstrated a machine called Panic Dialer. She explained that you put the 
receiver somewhere in the house and wear the sending device on a cord around 
your neck. Then if you fell down and broke a hip, or had any other kind of 
catastrophe, you could push a button to dial either the police or the fire 
department, or any one of four friends who could be expected to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Because my sense of balance was damaged by my stroke, I am regarded as 
potentially helpless. The other day I fell while trying to get into my wife's 
car and chipped my right ankle in two places. 
</P>
<P>
 Theoretically, the dialer dials the numbers serially until one of them 
answers. I'm afraid if I tried that I would not only get the police and the 
fire department, but all four of my friends or relatives would descend on me 
simultaneously. What a commotion that would cause in our street. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a neighbor, Chuck Coulter, came by with something in a red plastic box 
that looked like a large lunch pail. It was a Programmable Pain Management 
System. He demonstrated. The machine consists of two long wires with batteries 
at one end and pads at the other. You place the pads against whatever hurts -- 
shoulder, elbow, knee -- and turn on the juice, controlling it with a dial. I 
tried it. I felt small electric jolts going through my ankle. Now I'm sitting 
home alone surrounded by all these wonderful machines. I'm a little afraid of 
the pain management machine. I might electrocute myself. 
</P>
<P>
 My manicurist, Nancy, says I should roll a hot hard-boiled egg over my ankle. 
She says it will make the pain go away. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm going to try it. At least it can't electrocute me.

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; WHO WINS WHEN ACADEMICIANS VIE FOR THE LIMELIGHT?; 
DOGMATIC WISDOM: HOW THE CULTURE WARS DIVERT EDUCATION AND DISTRACT AMERICA BY 
RUSSELL JACOBY ; DOUBLEDAY $22.95; 235 PAGES 
</P>

<P>
 It's going to be interesting, a few decades from now, to see what's become of 
the cultural controversies roiling college campuses in recent years. 
Multiculturalism, race and gender studies, deconstruction, relativism and 
contingency, sexual censorship, political correctness; most of these debate 
topics will fade away, but at the moment it's impossible to say which.  
</P>
<P>
 All are plausible, and to pervert P.G. Wodehouse, it's impossible to throw a 
brick into a university crowd without hitting a wide-eyed adherent of at least 
one of these fighting faiths. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell Jacoby, a visiting professor of history at UCLA and author of "The 
Last Intellectuals," takes on most of the above-mentioned controversies in 
"Dogmatic Wisdom," and he finds more to condemn than to praise. In large 
measure he's out to answer, belatedly, "The Closing of the American Mind," 
"Tenured Radicals" and "Illiberal Education" -- what Jacoby calls "the three 
major critiques of American higher education," authored by Allan Bloom, Roger 
Kimball and Dinesh D'Souza, respectively -- but he exhibits as much distaste 
for the left as for the right. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacoby's major point is that the current "culture wars" concentrate on 
secondary issues, and if he doesn't give a considered argument on behalf of 
what he contends are the primary issues, at least he names them. One, and 
surely the most significant, is the fact that the academic world has come to 
embrace the marketplace -- often consciously, sometimes unconsciously, and 
occasionally even self-consciously. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Stanley Fish. An iconoclastic professor of English at Duke University, 
Fish has argued that blind submission of academic articles should be eliminated 
because the author's fame, or lack of it, is virtually inseparable from the 
paper in question. "The fact that my name is attached to an article," Fish 
wrote in 1988, "greatly increases its chance of being accepted." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacoby castigates Fish for demonstrating such "rank careerism," and rightly so 
-- but neglects to add that Fish's argument is also a half-sly, half-cynical 
acknowledgment of the bias inherent in any selection process. It's no secret 
that editors, academic and otherwise, tend to tolerate only those ideas with 
which they are sympathetic, regardless of the merit of dissenting views -- a 
predicament well-known authors can break, if they are willing to trade their 
fame for the chance to publish unorthodox ideas (as Fish does routinely). 
</P>
<P>
 Disagreeable as it is to be told that market forces play a significant role in 
academics, at least Fish recognizes their existence (or "foregrounds" the 
market, as one would say in modern scholarly parlance). Other academics deny 
being influenced by market issues -- even as they gravitate toward certain sets 
of ideas more conspicuous for their marketability than their innate value or 
durability. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacoby lambastes cultural critic Fredric Jameson for his defense of 
fashionably obscurantist prose, but it's easy to see the attraction: 
specialized language breeds fiefdoms, acolytes and power that's difficult to 
challenge, allows academics to be elitist and self-centered while appearing 
left-wing and ground-breaking . . . all without having to justify your work to 
more than a handful of other people.  
</P>
<P>
 The rise of gender and race studies can also be seen as a product of market 
forces, although here Jacoby treads more lightly. He suggests that 
Balkanization in academics is bad for cultural life because it emphasizes 
differences rather than similarities and separates disciplines even further by 
encouraging ever-narrower specialization. 
</P>
<P>
 Education's familiarity with the marketplace isn't entirely new, of course. 
Two of the more interesting sections of "Dogmatic Wisdom" involve the 
commercial ventures of Harvard President Charles W. Eliot, who after retirement 
sponsored the "five-foot shelf" of Harvard Classics, and Mortimer Adler's 
"Great Books" series, put out with the blessings of the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither Eliot nor Adler can compare with some of today's academics, who 
have become celebrities in their own right. Fish and Jameson, Catherine 
MacKinnon and Henry Louis Gates Jr., Jacques Derrida and Edward Said 
communicate serious ideas, but at times they and their ilk seem more like 
salespeople than teachers, professional professors rather than lovers of 
knowledge.  
</P>
<P>
 Our education system exists to serve society, but it's hard to finish this 
book without concluding that some academics, at least, believe society exists 
to serve educators.

O.C. ENTERPRISE: AVIATORS OWE LIVES TO FXC CORP.; SAFETY: FRANK CHEVRIER BUILT 
SANTA ANA FIRM INTO ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S LEADING MAKERS OF ESCAPE SYSTEMS FOR 
THE MILITARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frank Chevrier has nothing but satisfied customers. If they weren't, they 
wouldn't live to tell about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevrier is a former draftsman who built his company, FXC Corp., into one of 
the nation's leading makers of parachutes and automatic rip cord release 
devices for the military. 
</P>
<P>
 When a pilot bails out of his exploding jet fighter, it's FXC's rip cord 
release and parachute that saves his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Ditto for Navy commandos who can leap from planes so high that the jumpers 
need oxygen masks and glide for miles before hitting the bull's-eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Even space shuttles, revamped in the wake of the 1986 Challenger disaster, 
carry FXC escape systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every astronaut is fitted with our equipment. If they bail out, they are 
depending on FXC," Chevrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's satisfaction with his products is a matter of great pride to 
Chevrier, a French-Canadian native who still speaks with a hint of an accent. 
</P>
<P>
 In a business where success is counted in human lives, he said, his company 
hasn't failed a single aviator yet. The reason: FXC's ejection seat components 
have a built-in reliability factor of 99.99985%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Altogether, we've saved about 1,500 people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Chevrier has built a company that now employs 85 people in a 
large industrial building in one of Santa Ana's industrial parks. 
</P>
<P>
 His strategy was establishing strong military contacts, building a reputation 
for reliability and staying abreast of the latest ideas and technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy developed anti-submarine torpedoes that are dropped from patrol 
planes. FXC subsequently made parachutes to break their fall into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Air Force was working on ways of dropping vehicles and other heavy 
equipment from cargo planes, FXC developed a mechanism that breaks the 
parachute away in case the cargo won't budge -- thus preventing catastrophic 
drag that could cause the plane to crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is now devising parachutes that will allow cargo to be dropped 25 
miles from its eventual destination. It is then guided by a satellite-connected 
navigation device. It can even take reconnaissance photos along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevrier's business, which now has annual sales of $8 million, started humbly 
with a little black box that can be held in one hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevrier came to Southern California in 1962 during an economic boom fueled 
largely by the aerospace industry. A draftsman by training, he found work as a 
designer of airplane parts at Hi-Tek Corp. in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The product that turned out to be his big breakthrough was a small box that 
fit into a parachute pack and deployed the parachute automatically in case a 
pilot was unconscious or otherwise unable to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 When the parent company decided in 1973 to spin off the division that made the 
device, Chevrier took his $500,000 in savings and stock options, combined it 
with a bank loan for a like amount and bought the unit himself. His initials -- 
FXC -- became the new company's name. 
</P>
<P>
 The little boxes -- the automatic parachute releases -- proved to be a gold 
mine. The company would eventually ship 80,000 of them. The original cost was 
about $300 each; today they go for about $1,200 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Each is rigorously tested in FXC's lab. On a tour through the back rooms, 
Chevrier pulled aside a worker to show how tests are performed and each 
scrupulously logged. The system, he said, has to be fail-safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Farther back, the Guardian Parachute division sews and packs its products. 
Sewing chutes is tedious and difficult work that is done by exacting and 
dedicated seamstresses. 
</P>
<P>
 FXC also does a limited amount of civilian business. Some of its equipment is 
used by sport sky divers, and its parachutes can be found hoisting tourists 
from ski boats at Mexican resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of its work is still done in conjunction with the Defense Department. 
Though orders for new parachutes and release devices have slowed, the company 
is making up the lost business by servicing its old equipment.

 Question: Can an employer restrict an employee from doing work on his or her 
free time, like on the weekends? I can understand a boss not wanting you to 
work for a competitor, but can he prohibit you from doing absolutely any 
part-time work at night and on weekends, even if it isn't even remotely 
connected to your company or industry? 
</P>
<P>
 -- C.F., Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: As you recognize, an employer may have legitimate concerns about 
outside work that employees do on their own time. In addition to being worried 
about the possibility that you might be working for a competitor, an employer 
may also reasonably be concerned with whether another job might unduly distract 
you from your principal job, or whether you might be involved in something that 
would reflect badly on the company. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a complete ban on any other jobs sounds like over-reaching. 
Unfortunately, there are no hard and fast legal rules on the subject. It is 
pretty much up to the individual employer to develop its own policy. 
</P>
<P>
 If you cannot persuade your boss that part-time work on your own time will not 
interfere with your job, you will have to decide how important the part-time 
work is to you. If it's important enough, you may eventually decide that you 
are better off with an employer who has a more enlightened policy about work on 
your own time.

 Question: I am an employee of a large retail organization in Costa Mesa. My 
associates and I had to take a pay cut from $12 an hour down to $10, down to $8 
an hour, and to start paying for our own insurance to help a company in 
financial difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
 We willingly did these things and have strived to make our sales goals with 
the hopes of rebuilding the company. Unfortunately, it came to our attention 
that our newest associate has a contract and is making $21 an hour. Is this 
legal? Do we have the choice of going to the labor board? 
</P>
<P>
 -- N.B., Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Many employers have found it necessary to reduce employee pay or 
salary for economic reasons, perhaps to avoid layoffs or business closure. It 
is apparent your employer has tried to effectively communicate the situation 
for the wage reduction and successfully maintain employee "team effort" to 
rebuild financial stability within the company. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many factors when determining an employee's salary: performance, 
experience, education and level of responsibility are a few. It is uncertain 
from your question whether there is a "legal" issue regarding the newly hired 
associate's hourly rate of pay versus other associates. 
</P>
<P>
 I recommend you extend the same degree of communication to your employer and 
openly discuss these concerns. There may well be salary justification that you 
are unaware of that are self-explanatory. Indeed, common courtesy and good 
internal company communication is usually far more effective in resolving these 
issues than going to the labor board.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENTERPRISE; THINKING SMALL; BUILDER BETS THAT THERE'S A BIG 
MARKET FOR LITTLE HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everett Wilson had just taken a quick tour of a housing tract that may be the 
wave of the future in Southern California -- and he was not much impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the houses under construction at the new south Orange County 
development are as small as 870 square feet -- about a third the size of a 
typical 7-Eleven. On top of that, about 15 homes sit on each acre of land -- 
about twice the number in a typical tract. 
</P>
<P>
 "The homes are just too close to each other," opined Wilson, an appliance 
repairman who said he would rather keep renting his Mission Viejo apartment 
than buy one of the small houses at Los Abanicos, a neighborhood in the 
master-planned community of Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 "If my neighbor ate garlic for lunch," he added, "I'm afraid that I'd smell it 
from my own living room that night." 
</P>
<P>
 Such skepticism notwithstanding, builder RecreActions Group of Cos. thinks 
that its new development of 306 free-standing houses -- with prices starting 
below $130,000 -- could be an important step toward ameliorating Southern 
California's longtime housing affordability problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The homes are among the least expensive single-family detached houses to be 
sold in the high-cost areas of Southern California in recent years. The last 
time a developer offered detached houses in Orange County at this price was 
more than a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Newport Beach-based RGC are betting that many people who work in 
the coastal areas will buy a small house close to their jobs rather than a 
condominium or larger home in Riverside County that would require a long 
commute. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're targeting people who are willing to accept a slightly smaller home and 
a smaller yard in exchange for an affordable home that offers shorter commutes 
and more time with their family," said Jim Murar, an RGC co-owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Murar said Los Abanicos is RGC's investment -- which so far has totaled $10 
million -- in the idea that "some of today's home buyers will say, 'Enough is 
enough.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "We think a lot of people are willing to give up some of their living space if 
it's going to give them more time at home and save them money too," he said. 
"What good is buying a house if you're too tired from driving to enjoy it at 
the end of the day?" 
</P>
<P>
 Although inexpensive by Southern California standards, all the homes at Los 
Abanicos have at least two bedrooms, 2 1/2 baths and feature such niceties as 
tiled roofs and two-car garages. Base prices include central air conditioning, 
designer countertops and a kitchen full of built-in appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to keeping sales prices down? Density. The average of 15 homes per 
acre compares to about eight homes per acre in most new tracts and five homes 
per acre in a typical 1950s Southern California tract. The houses are precisely 
10 feet apart, the minimum separation allowed by building codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Squeezing that many homes onto each acre was critical to the project because 
land in Orange County is among the most expensive in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ready-to-build land where Los Abanicos is rising sells for about $500,000 an 
acre, which means that the lot itself would account for about $63,000 of the 
cost of each house in a typical tract of eight homes to an acre, according to 
the Meyers Group real estate consultants of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 By roughly doubling the number of homes on each acre and shrinking their size, 
RGC can trim about $33,000 from the cost of each house and pass the savings on 
to the buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen some builders put 10 houses to an acre, but nobody has tried 15," 
said Jeff Meyers, Meyers Group president. "It'll be interesting to see how 
buyers receive it." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if Los Abanicos sells out quickly, other developers may quickly follow 
suit, real estate specialists say. "Builders are the biggest copycats in the 
world," said Sanford R. Goodkin, a well-known real estate consultant in La 
Jolla who has worked in Southern California since the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this project flies, RGC will look like pioneering geniuses. If it flops, 
everyone will call them fools. It's the nature of the business." 
</P>
<P>
 The difficult job of coming up with a design to make the small homes seem 
larger than they really are fell to McLarand, Vasquez and Partners, a Costa 
Mesa architecture firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was an unusual layout composed of a series of courtyards, each one 
horseshoed by seven or eight homes. The front windows of each home look across 
the courtyard -- which functions as a sort of community front yard -- and on to 
the houses on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 Each home is also angled slightly so that its front door faces a different 
direction from the doors of neighboring homes, giving each owner a private 
entrance and a small but private yard. Most windows are angled too, allowing 
residents a view of the surrounding hillsides rather than of their neighbor's 
bedrooms or exterior walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wants to open their blinds and stare right into the wall of the next 
building," architect Ernesto Vasquez says. "That might be OK if you're living 
in a New York apartment, but, hey -- this is sunny Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 All of the homes have two stories, Vasquez added, because building that way is 
cheaper and uses less land than building a house of the same size all on one 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 "The homes are small, but they don't really feel small," said Karen Jeffers, 
who -- with her husband, Daniel -- recently plunked down a small deposit on an 
870-square-foot house. 
</P>
<P>
 Until they happened across Los Abanicos, the Jefferses had been resigned to 
the idea of buying a condominium because of their limited budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Their new house will be just a few minutes away from Karen Jeffers' part-time 
job as a bank teller and the work her husband does as a painter. It also will 
have a yard for their 4-year-old daughter and the baby the family will welcome 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've finally got our piece of the American Dream," Karen Jeffers said, "even 
if it is a smaller piece than usual." Making a Home Seem Larger 
</P>
<P>
 While the architects at RecreActions Group of Cos. squeezed as many houses as 
possible onto the land at Los Abanicos, they also tried to make the inside of 
the homes seem larger than they really are. 
</P>
<P>
 For example: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ceilings in many rooms are unusually high and oversized windows are used to 
let in more sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bathroom vanities are only 19 inches deep instead of the standard 24 inches, 
which the designers say still leaves plenty of storage space but gives families 
more floor space. 
</P>
<P>
 * Medicine cabinets in the bathrooms are recessed into the walls, leaving more 
space over the sink. 
</P>
<P>
 * Upstairs bathrooms are separated by a single wall, which saves money because 
both can be served by a single plumbing line.

SURVIVAL LESSONS LED TO SUCCESS FOR IMMIGRANTS; TECHNOLOGY: ROSE HWANG AND 
HUSBAND MITCHELL PHAN DREW ON EXPERIENCES IN ESCAPING VIETNAM TO BUILD A 
$40-MILLION COMPUTER-COMPONENT DESIGN FIRM IN 4 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Rose Hwang learned survival skills when she became a leader among refugees 
fleeing Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just by the escape, I learned tremendous lessons that will stay with me for 
life," said Hwang, now in her mid-30s and chief executive officer of Alpha 
Systems Lab, an Irvine company that designs components for multimedia 
computers. "It took determination, faith, planning and guts." 
</P>
<P>
 By applying that knowledge to business, Hwang and her husband, Mitchell Phan, 
have in just four years built Alpha Systems Lab into a company with nearly $40 
million in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Hwang and Phan, an engineer whose family escaped Vietnam two days before 
Saigon fell in April, 1975, recognize that the odds were against their 
succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a UCLA study released in May, immigrants from Southeast Asia -- 
Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos -- are comparatively more likely to live in poverty 
and be on welfare. The study also found that although many Asian Americans have 
started their own businesses, they have generally focused on low-margin, 
low-profit businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple give credit to their mix of talents -- Hwang's knack for managing 
business operations, Phan's technical savvy -- and determination and a bit of 
luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Hwang and her family of seven slipped out of Saigon in 1976 on a river boat. 
But, out of fuel and water, they were captured on the high seas by a Communist 
patrol ship. 
</P>
<P>
 The patrol vessel's crew brought the refugees aboard and tied their boat 
behind the ship, Hwang said. They told everyone to sit still on the journey 
back to Saigon, where the refugees believed they would be condemned to death. 
But the captors left Hwang unguarded. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't think a 17-year-old girl could do them any harm," she said. "That 
was their mistake. I was not a boy, but I was the oldest daughter and had a 
boy's heart." 
</P>
<P>
 She crept through the ship whispering a plan to her companions. The refugees 
then banded together to take control of the ship and sailed to Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Hwang and her family came to the United States, settling in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Hwang enrolled at Cal State Fullerton, eventually earning a degree in music. 
Her first job was playing the piano. She also worked as a court reporter and in 
marketing for a small high-tech company. She met Phan in 1979, and the two were 
married in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, who are now U.S. citizens, formed their own company in 1990 with 
$50,000 in savings. It generated $1.2 million in sales in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Asian cultures, men usually do all the business, and women stay behind at 
home," said Phan, who is vice president of Alpha Systems Lab. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that women can do a lot more," he said. "To men, I say put your ego 
down a little bit and you'll find the best kind of partnership." 
</P>
<P>
 A stroke of good fortune came in 1992. Electronic Data Systems, the 
multibillion-dollar computer consulting company, gave the fledgling Alpha 
Systems part of a $700-million contract to supply computer equipment to the 
Army, the Navy and Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 EDS also made prepayments for its first orders from the small company, 
allowing Alpha Systems Lab to expand without venture capital. Alpha Systems 
sales that year mushroomed to $38 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've done good work for us, and we've enjoyed working with them," said EDS 
spokesman Randy Dove. "Most of the contract work has been done now." 
</P>
<P>
 Alpha Systems Lab now has 60 employees at its headquarters in Irvine and 
subcontracts work to local assembly houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody else is shipping work offshore," Phan said. "We are creating jobs 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 "This country helped us," he said, expressing his gratitude for a gift of $300 
when he first arrived in the United States. "It's always been in my heart to do 
some kind of pay-back." 
</P>
<P>
 Alpha Systems Lab expects its government contracts to fall to 20% of revenue 
in 1994. But Phan says the company can sustain its sales with its latest 
product, the $1,095 MegaMotion circuit board, which can convert a personal 
computer into a teleconferencing machine that transmits documents and images 
over ordinary phone lines. It can also be used as a security monitor to perform 
surveillance of as many as 16 remote sites at once. 
</P>
<P>
 The MegaMotion board has brought Alpha Systems Lab into competition with an 
array of bigger companies, among them Intel Corp., IBM, Matrox and True Vision. 
Hwang said she thinks Alpha Systems Lab has an edge because its product was 
five years in the making and is better than any of the others' technology.

COMCAST TO BUY MACLEAN'S CABLE; TELEVISION: THE $1.27-BILLION CASH DEAL WOULD 
MAKE THE PHILADELPHIA-BASED COMPANY THE INDUSTRY'S THIRD-LARGEST CABLE 
OPERATOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Comcast Corp. said Sunday that it agreed to buy the cable television 
operations of Maclean Hunter Ltd. for $1.27 billion, giving further evidence of 
the ongoing consolidation sweeping the cable TV industry. 
</P>
<P>
 If the deal wins regulatory approval, it will make Comcast the nation's 
third-largest cable television company, with 3.5 million subscribers -- 550,000 
of them from the Maclean acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 Comcast's cash purchase, from Maclean parent Rogers Communications Inc. of 
Toronto, comes about two weeks after Times Mirror Co. agreed to spin off its 
cable TV unit into a new venture with Cox Enterprises Inc. for $2.3 billion. 
The Cox venture is expected to have more than 3 million subscribers when the 
acquisition is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The cable industry has been consolidating to achieve the size and regional 
concentration necessary to invest in services it anticipates having to provide 
in the future to compete with telephone companies, which will increasingly be 
able to deliver entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Maclean Hunter's cable and related operations include services in New Jersey, 
Michigan and Florida. Comcast serves customers in 15 states. 
</P>
<P>
 Maclean Hunter, a diversified media company also based in Toronto, is being 
bought for $2.2 billion by Rogers Communications, Canada's largest cable 
operator. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers has said it would sell Maclean's U.S. cable operations to pay down debt 
it took on to help buy Maclean, which controls Toronto Sun Publishing Corp., 
publisher of the Financial Post and Sun newspapers in Toronto, Ottawa, Edmonton 
and Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale to Comcast is subject to certain governmental and other approvals, as 
well as to Canadian regulatory approval for Rogers' acquisition of Maclean 
Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very pleased to have the opportunity to expand our cable operations 
through this significant transaction with RCI," Comcast President Brian L. 
Roberts said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some time, we have considered Maclean Hunter's systems to be a logical 
strategic extension of Comcast's cable business," Roberts said. "These 
properties are a great fit with our existing clusters in northern New Jersey, 
Florida and Michigan. The acquisition allows us to increase our presence in 
three of the top 15 television markets." 
</P>
<P>
 Graham W. Savage, chief financial officer for Rogers Communications, and John 
Alchin, senior vice president for Comcast, did not return repeated telephone 
calls seeking comment on their announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its cable operations, Philadelphia-based Comcast provides 
cellular telephone services to more than 7.4 million people in the Northeast. 
It has invested in cable programming, telecommunication systems and 
international cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers Communications has interests in cellular telephone services and other 
wireless communications networks. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, Comcast and Liberty Media Corp. backed QVC Network Inc. of West 
Chester, Pa., with a $1-billion investment in QVC's attempt to buy Paramount. 
QVC in February lost the bid for Paramount to Viacom Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in February, Comcast agreed to help in the local marketing of MCI 
Communications Corp.'s venture into the wireless communications business. The 
venture is trying to create a network to allow customers to use the same 
cellular telephone and phone number anywhere nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, eight states, including Pennsylvania, sued Comcast, saying 
the company used illegal billing practices. Pennsylvania and the other states 
-- Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky and 
Mississippi -- said Comcast subsidiaries tricked their customers into paying 
for services not approved. 
</P>
<P>
 All eight states are seeking refunds and, in some cases, civil penalties. 
Comcast has denied any wrongdoing and has asked a Florida court to declare its 
actions legal. Delaware, Indiana, Maryland and Michigan have also begun 
investigations. Top Cable Operators 
</P>
<P>
 Comcast Corp.'s plan to acquire the U.S. cable television systems of Maclean 
Hunter Ltd. will create the third-largest U.S. cable operator, measured by 
number of subscribers. Here's how the biggest players rank, assuming all 
pending acquisitions go through: 02,25,27 Company Subscribers (in millions)

 Is Sony Pictures Entertainment on the mend? 
</P>
<P>
 The company, whose ills lately have included too many big box-office 
disappointments and too few films released, has invited a renowned healing 
specialist to the studio this week to speak to its employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Deepak Chopra, a best-selling author and authority on the ancient Indian 
healing science of ayurveda, is scheduled to lecture at the Culver City 
studio's Cary Grant Theatre Thursday night. Sony Pictures Chairman Peter Guber 
is expected to introduce the physician, whose books include "Ageless Body, 
Timeless Mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Sony would no doubt prefer to be cured by decent box-office returns the next 
few weeks from "Wolf," starring Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer. Lecture 
Still in Gear 
</P>
<P>
 The Learning Annex calls it "your chance to hear the brilliant strategies and 
proven techniques" of a "turnaround czar." 
</P>
<P>
 What is it? A lecture next month by Mark Goldston, who resigned last Wednesday 
as president of sneaker manufacturer L.A. Gear amid mixed reviews about his 
three-year tenure there. The lecture, scheduled well before the resignation, is 
in Learning Annex's latest catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica-based sneaker maker has suffered a slide in market share 
during Goldston's tenure. It also lost money, with the red ink expected to 
total nearly $18 million for the first six months of this year. There has been 
only one profitable quarter since Goldston was hired in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some analysts and executives credit Goldston with keeping the company 
afloat, adding that he helped position it for a turnaround. 98 Great Things? 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most visible local morale-boosting ad campaigns of the past couple 
of years came from the folks at Santa Monica-based First Federal Bank. The 
theme was a list of "One Hundred Great Things About Living in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the reasons now suggests that should the campaign even be revived, 
it might need some updating because of recent developments. 
</P>
<P>
 Listed as No. 32 was the Los Angeles Rams, who appear serious about moving to 
another city. No. 74 was the Los Angeles Raiders, who also have flirted with 
the idea of leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, fans frustrated with the two teams' performances the past few 
years might look at their departure as another good reason to live here. 
Briefly. . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Trends Journal, a Rhinebeck, N.Y., publication that monitors business and 
social developments, lists among its "trends in decline" bartenders, chemical 
lawn-care services, department stores, 9-to-5 jobs and movie theaters. . . . 
Among "dying trends," it lists furs, home sewing, the Industrial Age, nuclear 
energy, typewriters and video stores. . . . Chicago-based Beltone Electronics 
is marketing a "designer hearing aid" that it says it designed "with 
enlightened advice" from Los Angeles-based artist David Hockney.

 House Votes to Abolish ICC: The House of Representatives voted to abolish the 
Interstate Commerce Commission, the nation's oldest independent regulatory 
agency. The ICC, founded in 1887, regulates rates set by railroads and trucking 
companies that carry freight.The 234-192 vote came on an amendment that cut the 
full $43-million budget for the ICC in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 from an 
appropriations bill for the Transportation Department and related agencies. 
Supporters of the amendment said the ICC was no longer needed as a separate 
agency because most rail and truck rates have been deregulated. The amendment 
would transfer the ICC's remaining functions to the Transportation Department. 
The Senate would also have to approve the action before the ICC could be 
abolished.

 Fuller Brush Changes Hands: Fuller Brush Co. is being sold again, this time to 
CPAC Inc., a Leicester, N.Y.-based chemical manufacturer.Fuller Brush, founded 
in 1906 by Coffman Shenk of Gettysburg, Pa., became a household name through 
door-to-door sales of brushes, cleansers and other home necessities by more 
than 12,000 sales representatives. Under the tentative agreement, CPAC will 
acquire all assets and certain liabilities of Fuller Brush, taking a heavy debt 
burden off a group of Kansas-based investors who bought the company from Sara 
Lee Corp. in 1989. The Fuller acquisition will boost CPAC's business by 50%, 
the company said.

GTE FORMS VIDEO GAME SOFTWARE UNIT; ENTERTAINMENT: WITH ITS INTERACTIVE MEDIA 
UNIT, THE COMPANY WILL ENTER A $7-BILLION MARKET.

<P>
 GTE Corp., the world's fourth-largest publicly traded telecommunications 
company, said Sunday that it has formed GTE Interactive Media, a wholly owned 
unit to develop entertainment software for the $7-billion video game market. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which has its headquarters in Stamford, Conn., said a formal 
announcement will be made today.GTE, which provides local phone service to 
parts of Southern California, is the first telecommunications company to make 
such a commitment to the video game industry, although it is one of many phone 
companies scrambling to cope with change in its industry. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE executives said the unit, based in Carlsbad, Calif., will introduce 20 new 
entertainment titles at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, which starts 
Thursday. The first games will be cartridge-based and will begin shipping in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Casey, vice president of marketing for GTE Interactive, said the company 
will consider developing software for game systems other than Sega and 
Nintendo. These include 3DO Co.'s Interactive Multiplayer and Sony Corp.'s 
PlayStation, which is not expected to come out in the United States until 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Company executives called GTE Interactive, which has been in the works for 
about four or five years, a "digital media studio" incorporating the talents of 
game developers, artists and systems makers. Its products will have cinematic 
effects, video and sound. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE Interactive games will be intended for boys 6 to 18 years old, who make up 
the majority of video game players. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it will also offer more entertainment for people of all ages 
and that it is developing "interactive toys" or games for children ages 3 
through 6. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE Interactive executives declined to give estimates as to how much parent 
GTE Corp. had invested in the unit, and they declined to give any revenue 
projections.

STEEL MAKER DECIDES AGAINST NEW PRICE HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 USX-U.S. Steel Group, the nation's largest steel maker, said it has decided 
not to raise carbon steel prices a third time this year, despite heavy demand 
and a competitor's move last week to boost its prices by $20 a ton in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Herring, a spokesman for USX Corp., U.S. Steel's parent company, said the 
Pittsburgh steel producer won't match the 3% price increase announced last 
Monday by Middletown, Ohio-based AK Steel Corp., the nation's sixth-largest 
steel maker. 
</P>
<P>
 With the steel industry enjoying its best year in more than a decade because 
of the U.S. economy's recovery and a boom in auto production, analysts had 
predicted that a third round of base price increases was inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 USX-U.S. Steel and its rivals previously raised their prices for flat-rolled 
carbon sheet products by about 3% in January and another 2% effective next 
month. Flat-rolled carbon sheet is typically used for auto bodies and 
appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 But USX-U.S Steel's decision not to raise prices lessens the chances that the 
next four largest producers -- Bethlehem Steel Corp., LTV Corp., National Steel 
Corp. and Inland Steel Industries -- will follow AK Steel's lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the year started, USX-U.S. Steel told its customers that base steel 
prices would go up in January and July. 
</P>
<P>
 USX-U.S. Steel "has decided not to implement any changes other than those 
we've announced," Herring said.

 Delta Gets OK on Virgin Atlantic Deal: The airline announced a favorable 
ruling by the Justice Department on its proposal to enter new markets by 
purchasing space aboard Virgin Atlantic Airways flights between the United 
States and Britain. The arrangement would introduce service by a third U.S. 
carrier to London's Heathrow Airport, a key international gateway, and enable 
Delta to fill a major void in its transatlantic operations. The British 
government has approved the deal.

 Foreign Car-Assembly Projects Outlawed: As part of its launch of a program to 
raise its own industrial giants, the country has banned new-car assembly 
projects that involve foreigners until 1996 and will tighten controls on car 
imports. The ban, part of a government initiative called the Framework of 
National Industrial Policy for the '90s, will focus resources to allow rapid 
expansion of eight existing car companies, said Ye Qing, vice minister of the 
state planning commission. Premier Li Peng approved the framework in March and 
said the automobile industry blueprint was the first of a series of programs 
"to help important sectors reach economies of scale," Ye said at a press 
conference.

 Severe Raw-Cotton Shortage Reported: Cotton production will rise this year, 
but the nation will still need significant imports to keep its vital textile 
industry in business, according to a U.S. government report.China produced 3.76 
million metric tons of raw cotton last year, the smallest amount since the 3.54 
million metric-ton harvest of 1986. China needs about 4.5 million metric tons a 
year for the industry, which employs more than 15 million people and accounts 
for more than 25% of exports and 16% of total industrial production. Widespread 
mill closures have been reported as raw cotton has become scarcer and more 
expensive.

 Parallel Purchase of Foreign, Domestic Rice to End: As of late July, the 
Japanese Agriculture Ministry will no longer require that domestic rice be sold 
with imported rice, Nikkei English News reported Friday.The policy mandating 
parallel purchasing of foreign and Japanese rice will expire when sales of this 
year's crop commence late next month, the report said. Earlier this year, the 
ministry ordered retailers and wholesalers to sell the two varieties together 
in order to prevent exhausting supplies of domestic rice and to encourage 
consumption of foreign rice. Japan abandoned a ban on rice imports last year to 
cope with a crop shortage.

 Hanoi to Drill for Oil in Disputed Area: Vietnam has started to drill for oil 
and gas in an offshore tract that China has awarded to an American exploration 
company, industry sources said last week. The state-run oil monopoly 
PetroVietnam is drilling an exploratory well in a part of the South China Sea 
that Crestone Energy Corp., based in Denver, is surveying for the Chinese 
government, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.Officials at 
PetroVietnam and VietSovPetro would not comment on the report. The Chinese 
Embassy in Hanoi offered no immediate response. Vietnam and China both claim 
the area of 25,155 square kilometers known in Chinese as Wan'an Bei 21 and in 
Vietnamese as Tu Chinh. The well is the first Vietnam has drilled in the 
disputed area, and it marks an intensified effort by Hanoi to counteract 
Chinese claims to a large swath of territory.

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: VARIABLE ANNUITIES WORTH A LOOK -- FOR NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Variable-annuity investors and the companies that market these products have 
dodged another tax bullet, the second in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Office of Management and Budget in April was kicking around the idea of 
taxing annuity earnings as a way to finance welfare reform. After 250,000 
telegrams opposed to the idea flooded Washington, President Clinton nixed the 
idea during a Cabinet meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years before, the Bush Administration included a plan to tax annuities in 
its budget proposal, but that effort also provoked public resistance and 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our understanding is that the idea of taxing annuities remains a 
revenue-raising option" within the OMB, says Jack Dolan, a spokesman for the 
American Council of Life Insurance in Washington. But for now, anyway, the 
clouds have lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 This means there's still reason to consider variable annuities -- a category 
of investment vehicles that essentially consists of mutual funds inside a 
tax-deferred insurance wrapper. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the tax benefit, annuities probably would not make sense over regular 
mutual funds, considering that they're more complicated and costly. If the tax 
break is removed, there's little doubt that variable-annuity sales, which have 
surged lately, would evaporate. 
</P>
<P>
 As investment vehicles, annuities resemble mutual funds. Both are diversified 
investment pools run by professional managers. Both feature low minimum 
investments, automatic reinvesting, an ability to switch easily among different 
portfolios, and other benefits. Many fund families also manage annuities, some 
of which have names and objectives similar to those of regular mutual funds you 
might own. 
</P>
<P>
 With annuities, you get to defer taxes on income and capital gains until you 
withdraw the money, presumably in retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 For active investors, a handy feature is the ability to make tax-free switches 
or exchanges among different funds. And conservative investors may appreciate 
the ability to make tax-deferred investments using a dollar-cost-averaging 
strategy or a periodic portfolio re-balancing strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 MetLife, for example, will automatically re-balance your holdings each quarter 
to your desired target mix, says Joseph W. Jordan, a vice president at the New 
York-based insurer. This option provides an automatic buy-low, sell-high 
discipline, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 By deferring taxes on profits and income, annuities thus work like a 
non-deductible individual retirement account, except that annuity investors can 
stash away as much money as they want, in contrast to the $2,000 yearly ceiling 
on IRAs. 
</P>
<P>
 Variable annuities are so named because they offer buyers a choice of 
portfolios that fluctuate in price, according to the behavior of their 
underlying stock or bond holdings. Fixed annuities, which pay guaranteed rates 
much as a certificate of deposit would, are also available. 
</P>
<P>
 But with fairly low fixed yields these days, variable-annuity sales have 
pulled even with fixed-annuity sales: Each category took in $36 billion last 
year, according to member sales figures reported by the American Council of 
Life Insurance, which represents more than 600 insurers. As recently as 1990, 
fixed annuities held a commanding lead of $48 billion in sales to $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Their hot sales pace notwithstanding, variable annuities are not for everybody 
because of their higher costs and illiquidity. Most contracts discourage 
near-term withdrawals -- more precisely known as "surrenders" -- by imposing 
back-end sales charges of 6% to 8% for money pulled out within the first year, 
with the fee gradually declining in successive years. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance-company surrender charges are in addition to a 10% Internal Revenue 
Service tax penalty that applies to withdrawals made before age 59 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 For this reason, annuities are most appropriate for investors in their 50s or 
older who have money they can afford to sock away for at least five years, 
Jordan says. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Strickland, editor of the Morningstar Variable Annuity/Life 
Performance Report in Chicago, advises a minimum 10-year holding period. 
Because of the cost and illiquidity hurdles, she suggests that investors should 
first seek tax-sheltered growth through IRAs as well as 401(k) and other 
employer-sponsored retirement programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Annuities should be your longest-term, least-liquid money," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Variable annuities, as noted, also are more complicated than regular mutual 
funds. Not only should you analyze annuities with an eye on investment 
considerations -- the fund's track record, approach, management tenure and more 
-- but you need to evaluate a slew of insurance features. These include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Annuity options. Plans offer various ways to draw monthly payments in 
retirement. For example, they can be spread over a set number of years, your 
remaining lifetime, or the lifetimes of you and another person. In part, the 
higher expenses on annuities go toward lifetime income guarantees that may 
exceed the insurer's actuarial assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Penalty-free loans. Contracts allow you to borrow some cash penalty-free at 
any time, but the amounts and interest rates will vary. 
</P>
<P>
 * Premium options. You can choose to invest in a lump sum or over time with a 
flexible premium arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 * Death benefits. If you die before you are to start receiving payments, your 
heirs would get back at least the money invested (less any withdrawals), even 
if your investments are showing losses. This is a common guarantee, but some 
contracts will increase the minimum death benefit beyond that every few years 
or so. 
</P>
<P>
 (Speaking of death benefits, a related product known as variable life 
insurance works much like variable annuities but with a heavier insurance 
component. That is, you can purchase much greater coverage.) 
</P>
<P>
 Along with their greater complexities, variable annuities also come with 
higher costs than regular mutual funds. Besides their generally stiff initial 
surrender charges, annuities impose investment expenses of about 0.77% a year 
for stock fund accounts, plus insurance costs of about 1.26% annually, 
Strickland says. These are in addition to contract maintenance charges of about 
$30 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Expenses on regular stock-oriented mutual funds, excluding any sales charges, 
average about 1.25%, according to Morningstar. 
</P>
<P>
 Strickland cites variable annuities from Vanguard ((800) 522-5555), Scudder 
((800) 225-2470), Janus ((800) 504-4440) and Fidelity ((800) 544-2442) as among 
the least expensive widely available products. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergence of less costly contracts, along with a wider range of annuity 
investments generally, gives buyers a lot more to choose from. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you last looked at variable annuities three years ago but didn't buy 
anything, you might like something now," Strickland says. Profile of Annuity 
Buyers 
</P>
<P>
 What type of people purchase variable annuities? A 1992 survey by the Gallup 
Organization attempted to answer that question. Some 1,007 annuity owners 
responded. The results indicate that variable annuities are bought primarily by 
middle-class investors, including many senior citizens. Here are some results.

HOT JOBS: DOCTOR FOLLOWS FOOTSTEPS OF CHILDHOOD IDOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Dr. Bruce Achauer was in junior high school, he worked in his father's 
pharmacy, waiting on customers and watching his father fill prescriptions. This 
experience, along with his interest in science and math, led him to decide, at 
age 13, to become a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone in our town looked up to doctors. They were respected and I wanted 
to be able to help people like they did," said Achauer, 51. 
</P>
<P>
 Today he is one of Southern California's most prominent plastic surgeons, 
specializing in the treatment of burn patients and the use of lasers in plastic 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Stanford University in 1963, Achauer entered Baylor 
College of Medicine in Houston. Upon completing medical school in 1967, he 
embarked on an internship at San Francisco General Hospital. "It was hard at 
that point to choose a specialty because I liked every field of medicine. I had 
a surgeon's skills and temperament, but didn't enjoy general surgery," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But later in his internship, Achauer spent time in the hospital's burn unit 
and observed plastic surgeons reconstructing disfigured patients. It was then 
he decided to make plastic surgery his field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plastic surgery is precise and creative and the reconstructive cases are all 
unique and difficult. Each presents a new challenge," Achauer said. "I am also 
able to develop a long-term relationship with my patients. Some of the 
reconstructive patients have been under my care for decades, from childhood to 
adulthood." 
</P>
<P>
 Achauer was called upon to reconstruct the face and body of 6-year-old David 
Rothenberg (now David Jordan Robinson) after he was set afire by his father in 
a Buena Park motel room in 1983. For the past 14 years, Achauer has served as 
director of the Burn Center at the UCI Medical Center in Orange. His work at 
UCI's Beckman Laser Institute has made him Orange County's leading expert in 
the use of lasers in plastic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would encourage anyone who chooses medicine to create your own specialty. 
It is a competitive field, but there are many needs to fill," Achauer said. 
OCCUPATION: Surgeon 
</P>
<P>
 * What's involved: Physicians and surgeons treat patients in a variety of 
settings, including clinics, hospitals and private offices. They diagnose 
illnesses, prescribe treatment and perform surgery according to patient needs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Qualifications: In addition to obtaining a medical degree, physicians and 
surgeons must complete seven to eight years of residency work in their chosen 
specialty. After that they must pass written and oral examinations to become 
licensed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prospects: One of the fastest-growing job fields in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: By 1998, the number of physicians and surgeons is projected to 
increase by 10.2% to 3,570. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary range: Beginning physicians and surgeons earn about $85,000 a year. 
Those with established practices can earn more than $150,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pros: Physicians and surgeons report a high level of satisfaction in being 
able to restore patients' health or appearance through treatment and surgery. 
They also have numerous options within the broad field of medicine to conduct 
research and develop expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cons: Medicine is a highly competitive field requiring at least 12 or more 
years of college. Aspiring doctors must then compete for residencies and score 
well on board exams. The field requires a great deal of effort, dedication and 
financial expenditure to become established. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advancement: After completing training, physicians and surgeons may opt to 
join a group practice or open their own office, where they would work to 
establish a reputation and increase the number of patients. Another option is 
working within an HMO setting, where they may advance to administrative 
positions. In addition to treating patients, many physicians and surgeons teach 
part time at medical schools. Some eventually become full-time professors or 
medical school administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: "About half of my practice is devoted to children, especially those 
who have been burned or born with serious deformities, such as a cleft palate. 
It's incredibly rewarding to be able use my training and talents to give to 
people in this way. Deformities used to affect people for life, but it is 
possible to transform them."

 ALL WET: It's the swimming season, and Southern California will have its share 
of big meets. Janet Evans, graduate of El Dorado High in Placentia and two-time 
Olympian, will be busy; included in her itinerary will be the Swim Meet of 
Champions Thursday through Sunday at Marguerite Aquatics Complex in Mission 
Viejo. Says Mission Viejo Nadadores Coach Bill Rose: "If you want to see some 
of the top swimmers in the country, this is the meet to come to." . . . Several 
other meets, including the Janet Evans Invitational July 21-24 at USC, will 
lead to the world championships in September in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 MAKING A SPLASH: Swimming isn't a glamour sport, but Aliso Viejo's Bjorn 
Zikarsky says it has helped his acting career. The 6-foot-10 Zikarsky, who 
competed for West Germany in the 1988 Olympics and trains with the Irvine 
Novaquatics Swim Club with an eye on the 1996 Games, said the sport got him 
into USC and has been a factor in landing roles. "It's given me the full ride," 
he says. His latest gig: a commercial with NBA star Shaquille O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
 GUPPIES: Top swimmers often seem as if they were born that way, but Johnny 
Johnson (above, with 3-year-old Scott Thomsen) says no. Johnson, co-owner of 
Blue Buoy Swim School in Tustin and Santa Ana, has seen some of the best -- 
including Olympians -- since going to work there in 1967. . . . "I remember 
some of them screaming, crying for Mommy, when they got in the water," he says. 
Most parents just want to make children pool-safe, he says, but after they 
start learning the strokes, "things start opening up." 
</P>
<P>
 JUNK FOOD: Before Sandy Zubrin, a senior-to-be at Corona del Mar High, left 
for the China Open Diving Invitational last month, she was warned about the 
food. But she still wasn't prepared for the bat wings and dog served her first 
day there. "Every day was a surprise, and she really dreaded going down to 
breakfast," said her mother, Bonnie. . . . Thanks to peanut butter and 
crackers, Sandy survived until she found some food she was used to. Zubrin will 
compete July 1-4 in the Southern California Diving Invitational at Marguerite 
Aquatics Complex. Erik Hamilton

GEORGE RAMOS: A NATIVE TURNS TOURIST ON TRIP INTO L.A.'S PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to L.A., I'm a smug native. I'm used to rejecting that urge to 
act like a tourist in my own city because I've already seen everything worth 
seeing. 
</P>
<P>
 Been there, done that. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was before I ran into West Gale, who vividly remembered asking for a 
picture of Billie Holiday from the famed singer herself at the Dunbar Hotel on 
Central Avenue. Ditto for Alejandro Garza who said he actually knew Simon 
Rodia, the creator of the Watts Towers. 
</P>
<P>
 And the smiling lady taking a walk on South Norton Street in Leimert Park knew 
why I kept staring at a certain pink stucco house in the 3800 block. I was 
trying to visualize the exact spot in a vacant field -- long since filled up by 
houses -- where the body of Elizabeth Short was discovered in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 "That house wasn't built yet, but that's the place where they found the Black 
Dahlia lady," she says. "Cut in half she was." 
</P>
<P>
 Never in my own city have I muttered "I didn't know that" so many times. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I went on a three-hour car tour of South-Central because a newly formed 
nonprofit coalition of community activists and groups has proposed some tours 
for any of the 7,000 reporters who will be in town to cover the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than see them do the predictable mix of gloom and doom stories in 
paradise, this coalition, called the Tourism Industry Development Council, 
wants the out-of-town scribes to see and report on the real L.A. "The way to 
tell the story of Los Angeles is not just to see the glitz of Hollywood and the 
coolness of the beach," says Madeline Janis-Aparicio, who is heading up the new 
council's efforts. "We want to tell the whole story." 
</P>
<P>
 It's also a way for community activists like Janis-Aparicio to thumb their 
noses at the powerful Greater Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau, which 
they say doesn't focus much attention on L.A.'s working-class neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 So the activists are organizing four half-day tours, on dates to be timed with 
the soccer competition, for the Eastside, the Pico-Union and Koreatown areas, 
Hollywood and South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted to see for myself what the competition might encounter on such a 
tour. So I decided to play tourist and see if my hometown instincts would 
survive. I chose South-Central because of the four areas, I probably know the 
least about it. 
</P>
<P>
 I admit I wasn't feeling that confident about my journey, but I plunged into 
it as I drove south on Central Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dunbar Hotel was the first stop on the tour's itinerary. Built in the 
1920s as a first-class hotel for blacks, the Dunbar was the center of Central 
Avenue's night life for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dunbar, now home to low-income seniors, is part of a revitalization effort 
in the area. But it really came alive for me when I ran into West Gale, a 
sometime actor who collects African art and lectures about it, at the hotel. He 
ticked off the names of the famous folks he's met at the Dunbar and it sounded 
like an all-star roster of jazz greats. Lena Horne, Billie Holiday, Cab 
Calloway and Bill (Bojangles) Robinson were guests there. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few years ago, I was across the street when I noticed Cab Calloway over 
here," he recalled. "He was quite nice and he posed for a picture." 
</P>
<P>
 Gale kept recalling tidbits about Billie Holiday doing this and somebody else 
doing that. He even showed off photos of a bit part he got in the 1953 film, 
"Mississippi Gambler," starring Tyrone Power and Piper Laurie. 
</P>
<P>
 I then realized the impact the Dunbar had on Gale and other African American 
residents in the area. Testimony to the Dunbar's standing in South-Central was 
that it was untouched in the civil uprising of 1992. Finally, I confessed to 
him, "I didn't know that." 
</P>
<P>
 "Complete strangers are always saying that when they come here," said Reginald 
Chapple, the project director of the Dunbar's economic development corporation. 
"There are just not enough of them coming around." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I could have made the same confession at the Watts Towers. There, area 
resident Alejandro Garza had several hours' worth of tales about Simon Rodia 
and his towers, one of them 99 feet high. "He was a simple man and it made 
sense to me when he left the towers without much fuss to live in Northern 
California (in 1954)," Garza recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Ditto for the Watts train station, the William Grant Still Art Center, oilman 
Edward Doheny's first mansion in L.A. on West Adams Boulevard and the place 
where the Black Dahlia murder victim was found. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sorry it took an event like the World Cup to prompt me to explore more of 
my city. I should have taken this trip through South-Central's history a long 
time ago. But I didn't know.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TODAY'S TOPIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a not-so-quiet revolution going on in California's public schools 
these days and, if reaction to the new CLAS tests is any measure, educational 
reform is not going to come easy. 
</P>
<P>
 The introduction last year of CLAS (California Learning Assessment System) 
tests in the schools provoked outrage from some conservative groups that claim 
the tests are unfair and intrusive. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's Platform, civic leaders, school administrators and parents shed 
light on the controversy that has surrounded the tests, which are given each 
year to fourth-, fifth-, eighth- and 10th-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 But what about the tests themselves? Is newer necessarily better? Is the new 
learning assessment system really as insidious as some make it out to be? Does 
it accurately assess how well a student is learning? Can students be evaluated 
fairly? 
</P>
<P>
 The section of the tests that has incited the most controversy focuses on 
language arts. Traditionally, students taking standardized tests were given 
passages to read and then asked to answer some multiple-choice questions that 
would reflect their learning comprehension. 
</P>
<P>
 The CLAS tests also give students passages to read. But they are then allowed 
to discuss the passages in groups, take notes and refer to those notes while 
writing a series of essays, some of which require them to reflect on their 
personal lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are asking students to make connections between what they've read and how 
that's applied to the world they live in," says Bob Anderson, a consultant with 
the CLAS in Sacramento. "We're not slighting the (previous) system of testing 
reading comprehension. These questions demand comprehension but they demand 
comprehension plus." 
</P>
<P>
 While some argue that it is impossible to create a concrete set of standards 
by which to judge the students' writing and comprehension, Anderson disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've discovered that teachers can be trained to work together and come up 
with the same judgments," he says. "What appears to be a subjective process is 
actually very clear to the teachers and is not based at all on whim or 
opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 More important, say some educational experts, the tests are providing a basis 
for restructuring the entire California educational system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish there was as much concern and attention on the test results as there 
is on the content of the tests," says state Sen. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara). 
"The test results indicate, particularly in the area of mathematics, that we 
are not doing a good job." 
</P>
<P>
 "Testing historically is done by determining a student's performance based on 
everyone else's," Hart says. "We are trying to move toward setting standards 
that all students must meet." 
</P>
<P>
 To do that, educators hope the CLAS tests will help change the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "CLAS is intended to stimulate reform and change the way teachers teach and 
kids learn," says Eve Baker, co-director of the National Center for Research on 
Evaluation, Standards and Student Testing. "We want to pull the educational 
system in a different direction."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: SERMON; ON JUDGING 
PEOPLE BY THEIR ACTIONS, NOT THEIR SKIN COLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RYUN CHANG, The Rev. Ryun Chang is pastor of Petra Ambassador Church in 
Orange. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Relatives of my wife who live out of town asked her to rent out their house. 
After many weeks of calls and showing the house, we finally had a renter. After 
obtaining the house key, the person moved in and refused to pay the rent. The 
only legal way to get her out of the house is through a costly eviction, which 
may take up to six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The renter happens to be African American, a member of a group that has been 
at odds with Koreans, at least in certain urban settings. The point of me 
telling this story is: "Should this person's action be judged?" I am sure my 
father-in-law would say yes and then some. After finding out that our church 
donated food to a black church after the riots, I heard him say, "So that they 
can regain strength to beat up more Koreans." 
</P>
<P>
 I assure you that he is no racist but such sentiment did disturb me. My being 
disturbed did not stem from the fact that I failed to see the wrongness of the 
rioters. What bothered me the most about this comment was the tendency to judge 
an entire group based on the deviant acts of some people belonging to that 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Simultaneously, I am just as disturbed by the societal tendency to excuse 
deviant behavior as the inevitable result of some environmental factors such as 
poverty, poor education, or discrimination. Neither way is an acceptable 
solution for people striving to live harmoniously in a multicultural region 
like ours. 
</P>
<P>
 By now everyone is quite familiar with the phrase multiculturalism . It is the 
philosophical base from which many public policies aimed at liberating the 
"oppressed minorities" have been legislated. As Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. 
pointed out in his book "Disuniting of America: Reflections on a Multicultural 
Society," the philosophy has had some healthy consequences, including 
long-overdue recognition of the achievements of minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some attempts to exalt the accomplishments of the "oppressed" while 
excoriating the "oppressors" have neutralized the ability of the "oppressed" to 
be self-critical of their own shortcomings. It has also unnerved some "contrite 
oppressors" from saying anything critical toward the "oppressed" lest they are 
labeled "intolerant," "insensitive," or "racists." 
</P>
<P>
 The unfortunate outcome has been the development of a "permissive attitude 
toward the erring members of the community -- particularly when they belong to 
racial . . . or economic groups less privileged than the general average," as 
James Burnham wrote in his book "Suicide of the West: An Essay on the Meaning 
and Destiny of Liberalism."  
</P>
<P>
 We should hold onto the transcendental values even if they were taught by 
oppressors who, to their shame, were hypocritically wrong on many accounts. For 
that reason, I judge the action of that phony renter who deceived my wife and 
her relatives: Skin color is irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 As Jesus put it in the Book of John: "Stop judging by mere appearances and 
make a right judgment." We should not be afraid to judge those elements that 
are detrimental to the good of the society. But we shouldn't judge to feel 
morally superior or destroy people, but judge as a necessary prelude to correct 
the perpetrators and to serve as a warning to others that some actions are 
inherently not good. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, let us never forget that there are three prerequisites to having a 
harmonious society: an agreement by all citizens about what is acceptable and 
unacceptable; a discernment to judge the good from the bad; and, an inner 
conviction to live on the side of the good and acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, we generally look to the government to be our moral authority 
and arbiter -- not a smart move. I hope instead that we can look to God and the 
Bible for guidance. 
</P>
<P>
 As for my family, we began to pray for this renter in the spirit of Christ who 
forgave us. We pray that this person may experience God's love and, as a 
result, realize the wrongness of her action. We pray that justice may prevail.

School in North Hollywood and lives in Encino.

<P>
 When I was very young, I didn't know what an ethnic background was, let alone 
being prejudiced. I was told that my mother was from a "faraway land called 
Japan" and my father was from America. 
</P>
<P>
 When I went to school, all my friends meant the same to me. It made no 
difference if they were African American, Jewish or Latino. They were all just 
friends to me. They were no less or more of a friend regardless of the color of 
their skin. And being friends, we all enjoyed our jokes and songs. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular song went like this: "I went to a Chinese restaurant to buy a 
loaf of bread. They asked me what my name was, and this is what I said: 
'L-i-l-i, chickaly, chickaly, pom-pom beauty, don't drink whiskey, Chinese, 
Japanese, Indian chief. Good grief!' " 
</P>
<P>
 To us, the most hilarious part of the song came when we made our eyelids point 
up for Chinese, down for Japanese and crossed our hands for Indian chief. The 
joke was funny up until second grade, when either we had become too "cool" to 
sing it or had just forgotten about it. 
</P>
<P>
 And all during that time, I didn't realize that I was Japanese. All that time 
I was laughing at myself, making fun of my ethnic background and I didn't even 
know it. We were only 6 or 7 years old at the time and I had already made a 
terrible stereotype of not only Chinese and Japanese people, but of myself. 
</P>
<P>
 I had forgotten this song until I went back to Oakwood Elementary School to 
see my old campus. As I entered the kindergarten class, an old memory was 
revived. 
</P>
<P>
 A young Chinese girl and a few of her friends had made a small circle and were 
singing songs. I recognized none at first, but when they invited me to sit with 
them, they started singing that song about Chinese and Japanese people. 
Although it had been years since I sang the song, I remembered all the words 
and hand motions perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
 As they all laughed hysterically, I tried desperately to laugh along with 
them. But inside I was truly hurt. I stayed calm, biting my lip not to say 
anything. Yes, they were only 5 or 6 years old, and they didn't even know who I 
was or what I was, but that was what hurt the most: They didn't know a thing 
about me. 
</P>
<P>
 I pretended it didn't affect me at first, but, in all sincerity, I will never 
forget it. Not only had it offended me, but this little Chinese girl was making 
fun of herself as I had done. 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted to tell her this, to warn her not to make the same mistake I did. But 
it was no use: It was funny to them. 
</P>
<P>
 This stereotype would be ingrained in their minds forever. A new generation of 
children, although being taught that "what really matters in a person is their 
inside," was keeping this terrible stereotype alive.  
</P>
<P>
 I pity me. I pity them. And I pity all others who keep this stereotype in 
their minds. Even though they are working hard to stop racial tension and hate, 
there will always be someone who'll keep this stereotypical song going on the 
kindergarten playground.

 "Don't go in there!" the neighbor cried, as I approached my first drop-off 
location, balancing a brown lunch bag atop a very hot container of food. 
</P>
<P>
 "She died several days ago." 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbor had evidently been standing watch, waiting for our arrival so she 
could share the shocking news with us. 
</P>
<P>
 She glanced nervously at the small, one-story house where the woman had lived. 
I stared back and mumbled my condolences. The neighbor seemed to want to spare 
me the possibility of intruding on sacred ground or facing some ghostly 
apparition. 
</P>
<P>
 This was not an auspicious start on my first day as a Meals-on-Wheels 
volunteer. Mrs. Crane, not her real name, had been receiving the low-cost, 
hand-delivered meals to her home for years, I'm told. 
</P>
<P>
 She had been one of 11 men and women on my delivery list this day who, because 
of age or illness, could no longer cook their own meals, shop, drive or do the 
myriad other simple acts most of us take for granted. No further examples were 
needed to show me the tenuous hold they have on life. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, a Meals-on-Wheels visitor is the only face they see all day, which 
explained the joyful greetings I received from most recipients. Unfortunately, 
there was no time to chat, since others were waiting for their food. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy, the day's driver, and I didn't have to travel far to find these men 
and women. They are peppered throughout our neighborhoods, hidden in tiny, 
cramped apartments, back alley walk-ups, houses that in days past were homes, 
not prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 One man greets me with a grunt and a nod, dressed in his undershorts, bathrobe 
and socks. I am only a delivery girl to him. Fine. I didn't volunteer for the 
applause. But I'm concerned about his apparent lack of self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 The message he appeared to be sending was, "No one cares about 'em, so why 
should I care about me?" 
</P>
<P>
 A former child star greets me with a hearty handshake. His wizened yet 
cherubic face breaks into a wide impish grin.  
</P>
<P>
 A woman in a wheelchair peers out her screen door at me, smiles, then 
struggles to open the door. Others beckon me inside, their eyes glued to the 
friendly faces on their television screens. 
</P>
<P>
 We've completed our route and in that brief hour, I've contemplated the nature 
of existence; the state of aging; falling from grace; falling into dependency; 
how long life is; how short life is; and, how, through simple acts, we can give 
and receive so much. 
</P>
<P>
 Meals on Wheels always needs volunteer deliverers and drivers. In Culver City 
/ Palms / West L.A., call (310) 559-0666. In Santa Monica, (310) 394-5133. In

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: FAVORITE PLACES; 
BACK BAY TRAIL, NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Back Bay Trail runs along the edge of the tidal estuary off of Upper 
Newport Bay. There's a vast expanse of water that runs to the cliffs across the 
way, so you get a great feeling of openness.It's a protected wildlife area. 
Typically you see walkers, some bicyclists, and a lot of birds -- egrets, 
herons, coots. There are birding groups: formal, serious birders with 
binoculars and field guides and floppy hats. You get a sense of wilderness 
seeing the birds in their natural habitat.  
</P>
<P>
 The glorious thing is that it's very accessible. I used to have a law office 
in Newport Center and I would change into my running clothes and go down and in 
10 minutes I was completely away from the office, away from the city. It's a 
good escape. Whenever I go through Orange County I try to make a point of 
passing through. It's like seeing an old friend." 
</P>
<P>
 -- BILL BELDING, attorney and writer, Santa Monica 
</P>
<P>
 Back Bay Trail winds along the foot of the bluffs that border the 752-acre 
Upper Newport Bay Ecological Reserve. The wetlands were purchased by the state 
and became part of its Ecological Reserve System in 1975 after a legal battle. 
The trail is about 2 1/2 miles long, running from near Pacific Coast Highway 
inland to the edge of Irvine. It offers a combined bike path and jogging trail 
as well as disabled access. Programs range from kayak tours and nature walks to 
nighttime marsh prowls and campfires. For information, call (714) 640-6746.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: COMMUNITY ESSAY; 'HE 
MADE EXCUSES AND WE DIDN'T ASK'; BECAUSE OF THE STIGMA OF AIDS, HE NEVER LET 
HIS FRIENDS KNOW HOW BAD HIS CONDITION WAS UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH PEACOCK, Deborah Peacock is a bartender in Culver City and was a 
friend of Art's for four years. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My friend has died of AIDS. I am heartbroken. Because of the stigma this 
disease carries with it, he never let anyone know how grave his condition was 
until it was too late for me and his other friends to tell him how much we 
really cared. And now I must live the rest of my life thinking of the words I 
left unsaid. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember so many things about Art: his early morning coffee chats, his 
penchant for talking too loud, his love of food and cooking, and his love for 
betting on football, basketball, or baseball. As his father said, "Art's 
favorite three words were 'I'll bet you.' "  
</P>
<P>
 His real love was football, though he never had a favorite team. His team of 
the week was the one he thought was going to win. When he lost, he was quiet 
for a while, but then moved right on to the next game. 
</P>
<P>
 I also remember his hatred for Friday the 13th. He would always let us know 
the day before that he would not be in on that Friday. He said he fed his dogs 
and locked the doors and didn't leave the house until the next day. Over the 
three years I knew Art we never saw him on Friday the 13th. The teasing he 
endured because of that superstition. 
</P>
<P>
 I work as a bartender at a place that opens at 6 a.m. Most mornings when those 
doors opened, there stood Art with the newspaper. The first question out of his 
mouth was "What's for dinner?" Only when he quit asking that question in the 
last month did I realize that something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs were always there, but he made excuses and as friends we didn't ask. 
Looking back I don't know if we were respecting his wish for privacy or were 
afraid to hear the truth. When I first met Art he played pool every morning. 
Nine months before he died he found a new pleasure: darts. He knew nothing of 
darts and it showed. Still, he played everyday with anyone who would play with 
him until he could stand proud with the best players in the house.  
</P>
<P>
 One day he quit playing darts, quit being loud, quit asking "What's for 
dinner" or "Do you wanna bet?" Finally, he couldn't form his words. Outwardly 
we kept up the pretense that he would be fine. Inwardly, I knew that he had 
used up all his resistance toward this deadly virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Melinda, a friend of Art's, and I went to see Art at the V.A. Hospital on 
Thursday, May 12. He had taken a turn for the worse since I had last seen him 
on May 3. I felt like we said our goodbys to him and Melinda was adamant that 
he could hear what we were saying. When we left, I think we were both at peace. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day we at the bar remembered Art and his hatred of Friday the 13th. 
How many of his friends mentioned this. I met Art's dad and Tony, his 
companion, for the first time, when I took over a meal I had made. The last 
time I saw Tony was when he was heading for the hospital to see Art. Tony was 
in a great mood as his calls had paid off and they would be able to make Art's 
wish of dying at home come true.  
</P>
<P>
 But Art's wish never came true. He died at 8:52 p.m. Friday, May 13.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: CONVERSATION WITH 
ANTHONY THIGPENN; POLICING 'MUST BE TAILORED TO EACH COMMUNITY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By As Los Angeles moves toward establishing a community policing policy, the 
conflicting ideas of two men, Deputy Chief Mark Kroeker and community activist 
Anthony Thigpenn, increasingly define the debate. In this first of a two-part 
series Thigpenn, chairman of the Board of AGENDA (Action for Grass Roots 
Empowerment and Neighborhood Development Alternatives), discusses 
community-based policing with James Blair. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: How do you define community-based policing? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: It would be a partnership between the police and the community working 
to increase public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does your version differ from that being developed by the LAPD? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There are a number of differences. One, the program itself (should) be 
jointly designed by the community and the police as opposed to a program that's 
been designed and brought out to the community. Second, it should include 
mechanisms from community people to select their own representatives on 
advisory boards. There should be input in deployment, tactics (and) some formal 
mechanism for monitoring issues of police brutality and misconduct. The 
contemporary debate (on) community-based policing has really come out of the 
reform movement of the last several years. To build the kind of trust, 
particularly (in) South L.A. given (the) historical relationships with the 
police, addressing issues of accountability, responsiveness, misconduct (and) 
brutality (cannot) be ignored but has to be dealt with up front. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You're just dealing with the South Bureau area. Do you see this plan being 
expanded to the entire city? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think it should. Each neighborhood is different and the program has got 
to be tailored to the history, needs and dynamics of each community, which is 
why community organizations and institutions need to be involved in the 
specific design.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Demographics in this city shift as fast as anywhere in the nation. Who 
defines community? Who sets the boundaries? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think the natural boundaries -- neighborhoods that have a 
self-identification, communities that identify themselves as a community -- 
really have to be the basis, then integrate in other, more formal boundaries. 
But you have to pay attention to demographic changes to make sure that what 
you're doing is representative of the different sectors of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Authority brings responsibility. Do you see active citizen participation of 
the kind you describe opening neighborhoods or their representatives to 
potential legal and financial liability? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. Deciding what policies may be more appropriate, giving input into 
deployment patterns, those kinds of things, I don't think opens participants up 
to legal culpability. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Would your program end up with rivalries between communities vying for 
already scarce police resources? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think it's more cost effective. As you have neighborhoods organized and 
people really buying into a process -- feeling ownership for it -- many 
problems that normally they would call the police for they can solve themselves 
or participate in solving themselves. The other point is that right now in 
South Bureau the 30 senior lead officers (are) functioning essentially as 
community organizers -- not doing what would be traditionally considered law 
enforcement. With the community taking the lead in organizing, it can be done 
broader and deeper and resources that rightfully should go to law enforcement, 
could, in fact, go to that. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Any hope for a compromise between your view and LAPD's? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. Just to be clear: Our view is that all the "stake-holders" -- all the 
people who have a stake in public safety -- need to be brought together to 
craft the best possible policy. We have ideas on how this should be done. LAPD 
has ideas. I think (Deputy Chief Kroeker) is absolutely sincere in what he's 
trying to do; and I think that reasonable people (can) differ. But it's really 
a dynamic process that's going to come up with the best public safety plan. It 
simply can't be driven by one particular entity.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: PLATFORM; CLAS TEST: 
WHAT'S ALL THE CONTROVERSY ABOUT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Compiled for The Times by James Blair 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Controversy surrounding the recent California Learning Assessment System 
(CLAS) test has divided several Los Angeles and Orange County communities. The 
Antelope Valley school board was ordered by a judge a week and a half ago to 
administer the test, the first district to be ordered to do so. Below, local 
school board members, educators and parents discuss the test and the 
controversy.  
</P>
<P>
 BILLY A. PRICER 
</P>
<P>
 Board president, Antelope Valley Union High School District 
</P>
<P>
 On April 20, we voted 3-2 not to administer the test. Many parents (felt) that 
it was very invasive and that it asked questions that dealt too much with a 
preoccupation with death and violence. There were many who thought there were 
racial implications and overtones as well. 
</P>
<P>
 I found other problems. There was a lack of ability to administer the test for 
the amount of money being spent, and the kids aren't even trained as to what 
kind of material they're going to be tested on. A superintendent said it very 
simply: How can you be tested on something you haven't been taught? 
</P>
<P>
 As a parent, I am concerned (we're) not getting a good overall academic 
assessment. What you're getting is a group grade or district average -- the 
State Education Department violates its own code, which states that every 
student will be assessed individually in certain grades on a yearly basis. 
Another problem is the subjectivity of grading. It's very difficult for someone 
judging an essay who doesn't know a student to figure out what was going on in 
that child's mind. AUDREY YAMAGATA-NOJI 
</P>
<P>
 Board vice president, Santa Ana Unified School District 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't find anything that was all-out offensive. I also don't think that 
taking a test changes anybody's family values. I actually felt after reading it 
that a child who has very strong family values would do very well on the test. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several different issues about CLAS. The biggest concern 
administratively that we have is that this appears to be a shift in how we do 
assessment of students -- an attempt to come up with a more authentic 
assessment. But in doing so it was such a radical shift from what I think 
people associate with standardized testing that it scared a lot of people. The 
revelation that not all the tests would be scored certainly upsets people. When 
you put the time into it you want to know that's being done. CINDY PISZYK 
</P>
<P>
 Parent of three children in the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District 
</P>
<P>
 None of my children were the ages to take the test so I was not confronted 
with the issue of whether or not I wanted my child to take it. But initially I 
was very excited with the concept. Any kind of testing that's looking to 
identify higher thinking is very important and we need that. Any time students 
are asked to use written words as opposed to multiple choice (testing it's) 
important because as they grow older they're going to have to make their 
decisions and be able to present them that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Then all this stuff hit. I attended a couple of different lectures and my 
opinion went back and forth. I was concerned with some of the literature 
selections -- that the younger-age ones might not be age appropriate.  
</P>
<P>
 Another point that was brought up in some of those forums was that children 
are asked opinion type questions. If you have a very imaginative child and they 
make up a situation (that) could be connoted as being the child's situation at 
home, the child could be labeled "at risk." That is a parent's worst nightmare 
-- having somebody say you're abusing your child. That whole issue is very 
frightening to me. WILLIAM M. OLENICK 
</P>
<P>
 Board member, Antelope Valley Union High School District 
</P>
<P>
 Call it what it was. (The majority of the board) voted to ban the CLAS test. 
What bothers me is that the majority hid behind the banner of parental right. I 
found it ironic that in doing so they stepped all over the rights of the 
parents who wanted their children to take the test; and I felt that was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 I had heard horror stories (before seeing the test) indicating it was perhaps 
out of line. When I reviewed all seven versions of the 10th-grade CLAS test 
absolutely nothing was invasive of the students' or families' privacy. It was a 
stand-up test, an excellent test. The math portion was probably the best I've 
seen. The majority will argue they were right (because) all these people opted 
out. That wasn't the case at all. Students were given a choice of taking the 
test or not -- they didn't even need the parental opt-out slip signed.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet without fail students who took the test came out saying, "What's the 
problem? It's a great test and made me think. There's nothing invasive or 
controversial about it." ROSEMARIE (ROSIE) AVILA 
</P>
<P>
 Member, Santa Ana Unified School District Board of Education 
</P>
<P>
 I oppose the CLAS test. I think this is a cover-up for the educational 
community's failure. They have not succeeded in teaching our kids academically 
the way they should. So instead of getting back to what does work, they're 
going to say that academics don't matter. They're saying academic skills aren't 
going to be that important because kids are always going to have calculators; 
they don't need to learn how to spell because they're going to have these 
little computers that spell for them because we're all in this information age. 
It doesn't matter if they know history sequentially or know their place in 
history (because) they'll be able to just grab all this information.  
</P>
<P>
 My feeling is that our schools have got to get back to the basics, get back to 
teaching kids how to read and write and master math so they can accomplish more 
in life. CAROLINE PETERSON 
</P>
<P>
 President, Fullerton PTA Council 
</P>
<P>
 Generally it could be a good instrument to measure student learning. The 
concept has value, but it hasn't been fully developed. It needs time to have 
some of the imperfections worked out. But I think there's value in having this 
type of assessment tying in with our state curriculum.  
</P>
<P>
 I haven't spoken with that many people who have expressed concern about it. 
There's a lot of reaction to the media coverage. I think there has been a 
certain amount of misinformation that has gotten out as to the content of the 
test -- before the content actually had been revealed. Dr. DUNCAN JOHNSON 
</P>
<P>
 Superintendent, Fullerton (Elementary) School District 
</P>
<P>
 We're in a situation where we said we wouldn't give the test and (I'm sad) 
because a change that has immense potential is so clouded with controversy that 
it's difficult to know what's going to happen next. 
</P>
<P>
 The comments that I've received have been about 99% positive about the stance 
the district has taken -- for a variety of reasons not necessarily the same as 
the reasons we chose not to give the test. 
</P>
<P>
 We had been arguing with the state for about three months about our 
preparation to properly administer the test. The crowning blow was when we 
received the tests a month late and were already out of the testing window. It 
was the administration of the test that we said was badly flawed and therefore 
we did not think we would get valid results. That was before the controversy 
over the content and appropriateness of the test unfolded. That has not been 
our argument.

that litigation costs can and should be reduced by forcing responsibility upon 
the agency involved, thereby encouraging corrective actions, she goes on to 
recommend that we stick our heads in the sand by denying that a problem exists 
and prohibit anyone from complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 De la Torre struggles for credibility by attempting to justify her position by 
economic arguments, i.e. that the "tort system" is replacing the market system 
in allocating resources. This is unforgivable nonsense from an economist. The 
market system requires that "allocation of resources" be by free and voluntary 
transactions, without fraud or violence. When one is injured by another, that 
is not a free and voluntary transaction. The whole purpose of the tort system 
is to correct those non-market transactions. The tort system complements the 
market system and makes it workable in the real world; economic freedom and 
justice are intertwined. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, De la Torre suggests that we do away with the jury system and resolve 
these claims by dispute-screening and arbitration. Our jury system is under 
attack by many individuals and groups, and the defense of this bulwark of 
justice and freedom is not a popular cause. This is so perhaps because so many 
of us take the fruits of the jury system for granted and forget the horrors of 
justice administered by the elite. Economist De la Torre should know better.

 * I endorse the position of De la Torre in calling for a stop to the 
"litigation lottery." However, she restricts her argument to the effects of 
this lottery on public services and the results to all of us of increased taxes 
and decreased services. 
</P>
<P>
 The concerns she cites about excessive tort cases against public agencies 
could be stated with the same truth about such cases against insurance 
companies, doctors and other professionals, large businesses, and any entity 
that can be seen by the ambulance chasers as having deep pockets. The huge, 
resultant awards from these cases also increase the costs of our auto 
insurance, medical fees, drug prescriptions, as well as such basic needs as 
food, housing and shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not just public services that are impacted by this giant transfer of 
wealth to a comparative few individuals and attorneys. We should also keep in 
mind that an individual claimant wins only once. The attorneys who specialize 
in this field win again and again. 
</P>
<P>
 The courts have to recognize the damages an individual provably sustains, and 
an attorney is entitled to be paid. It is the punitive damages side of all this 
that causes the grossly excessive awards in these cases. How do you measure 
mental anguish or resentment against injustice, incompetence or the lapses of 
others that have resulted in severe damage to an individual. 
</P>
<P>
 Such causes as these, particularly when they are egregious, demand punishment. 
I submit that it is the function of the courts through criminal cases to 
administer such punishment. Punishment by the individual is nothing more than 
personal vengeance, and the attorneys who profit from this are parasites on 
those of us who must pick up the tab.

 It seems to me that Robert J. Samuelson ("Why Getting Ahead Feels Like Falling 
Back," Commentary, June 8) isn't old enough to remember, but regardless of all 
of the feel-good statistics that he trots out to "prove" that things are better 
than ever, there is at least one important indicator that proves that he is 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 As someone who is old enough to remember what things were like during the 
Great Depression, I can tell Samuelson, that by one very important measure 
things are now even worse than they were then. During the 1930s, it was 
possible for my father to house, feed and clothe a family of seven on the very 
modest salary of a "blue-collar" job. Today, not even professionals with "good" 
jobs can do that. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of what gadgets and luxuries are available to us now, the simple 
fact is that when it is no longer possible to meet even the basic needs of a 
family without several members having to work, as any economist knows, we are 
poorer.

 In the 1970s my husband was a petty officer in the Navy, we had one child and 
I didn't work. We had a lovely apartment in San Diego, a late-model car and 
spent our weekends going on day trips or to the movies. We had no debt because 
no one would extend us credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's the '90s, we both have been working for 20 years, my son supports 
himself, we live in an average apartment in Fullerton, we have two cars that 
are on their last legs, we rarely go out, have no toys yet we're $5,000 in 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't debate with a clever economist like Robert Samuelson, who could argue 
with all those statistics. He tells me and the millions like me that our 
incomes really aren't stagnant, that we're really quite prosperous, that 
everything is peachy and we should just quit our whining, that our perceived 
rut is just in our imagination. Well, what does someone like me know about such 
matters?

ANGELES FOREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The June 6 editorial "Angeles Forest: Loving It to Death" is correct on one 
point: National forest budgets are rigid and complex, much too rigid and 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 I live across the road from a Forest Service fire station (Big Tujunga), which 
is manned 24 hours a day.Adjacent to this fire station is Stoneyvale Picnic 
Ground, which, due to "budget cuts," is closed and locked at 6 p.m. even though 
there's more than two hours of daylight remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Molzahn, the district recreation officer, says they don't have any money 
to pay someone to close the gate at dusk instead of 6 p.m. when many families 
are in the midst of a picnic dinner. Yet this gate is barely 300 feet from the 
fire station. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked why one of the firemen can't walk over and lock the gate, Molzahn 
said, "They're paid from fire suppression funds, they can't do 'recreation' 
work." This scenario is being repeated throughout the forest in an effort to 
antagonize the public into complaining to their elected representatives and 
thus gain more funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Forest Service starts charging fees, they should lose their 
bureaucratic rigidity and properly utilize the funds they already have.

MORMON CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though well written, your article made it appear as though leaders of the 
church prefer to have believers accept, without question, what we're told. On 
the contrary, the doctrines and leaders of the church have always encouraged 
members to pray and ponder and gain a testimony of the Gospel, whether 
contained in the Scriptures or received as modern-day revelation.Part of that 
testimony entails faith in our leader. The doctrines of the church will not 
change to cater to people who cannot accept God's teachings. 
</P>
<P>
 This brings me to my second point. Your writer commented that Jesus "chose 
only men as his disciples." Anyone who is a member of the church knows that we 
are all engaged in God's work; whether as disciples, leaders, teachers, or 
mothers and fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 Discipleship is not limited to a position with a title. Being 31 years old I 
am the perfect candidate for the feminist movement. However, it is unavoidably 
apparent that men and women are different. Though equal in God's eyes, we have 
different abilities with different responsibilities. Women's organizations in 
the church have an enormous amount of influence. I truly feel that women who 
have let their desire to hold the priesthood blind them to the truthfulness of 
everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ have no concept of their abilities and 
responsibilities as women. 
</P>
<P>
 One final note, I totally support President Hunter's call for harmony. We live 
in a selfish world. Many beautiful things can be accomplished by working 
together.

HELLO! ANYBODY IN THERE?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Los Angeles city bureaucracy, as in deep space, no one can hear you scream. 
At least that's the impression one might get from the city's torpid response to 
problems in its badly flawed workers' compensation system. 
</P>
<P>
 As far back as 1989, auditors in the city controller's office as well as 
private consultants were warning that bureaucrats in the city's Workers' 
Compensation Division needed to correct systemic problems that were inviting 
fraud, pushing up injury caseloads and costing millions in scarce dollars to 
pay off questionable claims. Alas, five years later it looks as if things 
haven't changed much. For its part, the bureaucracy fiercely has resisted 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a city task force, Los Angeles municipal employees file nearly 
twice the number of injury claims filed by other government employees and 
payments per worker average $2,169, more than 2 1/2 times the national average. 
</P>
<P>
 One employee here is under investigation on suspicion of defrauding the system 
of nearly $1 million. That's an outrage, especially in a city so deeply hurting 
for money. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not as if changes haven't been proposed before; a number have come from 
Controller Rick Tuttle's office and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 We wish every success to Faye Washington, the new head of the Personnel 
Department, as she attempts to institute the recommended changes. To help her, 
the City Council should approve a proposal to hire an outside firm to reduce 
the city's 42,000-case backlog -- and perhaps even to help the city foresee any 
problems that may lurk beneath the surface.

THE MEANING OF BEING JAPANESE; POWERFUL STORY TOLD BY LOS ANGELES MUSEUM 
EXHIBITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Wednesday the Japanese American National Museum in Downtown Los Angeles 
receives its most distinguished visitors ever. Emperor Akihito and Empress 
Michiko of Japan will view "Issei Pioneers," the museum's admirable inaugural 
exhibit on the first generation of Japanese immigrants to Hawaii and the 
mainland United States (open to the public through Tuesday). 
</P>
<P>
 When the king of Hawaii wrote the emperor of Japan in 1882 inviting 
immigration, both traditional monarchs were under the control of 
tradition-breaking economic interests. Many of the Issei who accepted the 
invitation had been dislocated by wrenching economic changes in their homeland. 
But if troubles in Japan were the push, there was also, at least for some 
emigrants, the pull of the legendary American freedoms. One young Issei woman 
wrote: "If I married well in Japan, there would be a mother-in-law, and for the 
kind of willful girl I am, that would be pretty bad. So my father thought I 
should go where there would be no in-laws." 
</P>
<P>
 Empress Michiko, who was rendered speechless for a time by the stress of life 
in the family into which she married, may read these lines with interest and 
perhaps view with equal interest the touching home movies showing life in the 
kind of family the spirited young emigrant may have begun. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit also tells a far grimmer story, of course. Working conditions on 
the plantations of 19th-Century Hawaii were as bad as those on the slave 
plantations of the Old South. An overseer's bullwhip lies coiled under 
plexiglass as a brutal reminder that white plantation owners regarded their 
Japanese-born workers as barely human. 
</P>
<P>
 And the American nation as a whole, alas, also refused to accept the Issei as 
future citizens. Few American stories betray the American ideal more shamefully 
than the blatantly racist denial of citizenship to immigrants from Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 And then came the World War II internment, financial ruin for many and a wound 
in the heart for all. That wound has begun to heal. Inwardly and outwardly, the 
Japanese American recovery has paralleled the Japanese recovery. But that is 
just the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly but surely, the children and grandchildren of the Issei have made their 
legal status reflect their own correct perception of their American identity. A 
century ago, the Issei, in American eyes, were not Japanese Americans but 
Japanese in America. The Nisei (second generation) and Sansei (third 
generation) are indeed Japanese Americans , and the meaning of American is 
different as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 And what about the meaning of Japanese ? The answer to that question matters 
for the whole world. On Wednesday, when the imperial couple visit the museum in 
Little Tokyo, we hope all Japan will be looking on in spirit -- and thinking.

LAST MONTHS OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last months of life can be some of the most meaningful if you plan it and 
are able to carry out the plans ("Decide Now How You Don't Want to Die," by 
Drs. Neil Wenger and Martin Shapiro, Commentary, May 29.)Like Jackie Onassis 
and President Nixon, we were given options three years before and we made the 
choice -- we chose quality over quantity. We knew when the time had arrived to 
cut out all the community, volunteer and social activities (we had been retired 
for 15 years and led very busy lives) so that the last three months belonged to 
us -- wheelchair and all. He educated me to his desk work, we had time to enjoy 
patio lunches, we remembered and we laughed and cried, we picnicked at the 
ocean, took rides in the evening to get ice cream cones, we read to each other 
and, at the last, I to him. He died at home, with dignity and grace, surrounded 
by his family and all the love that could be lavished on him. 
</P>
<P>
 Those last three months are some of the most precious of the 58 years we had 
together.

EYEWITNESS: GEOFFREY COWAN; REDEFINING AMERICA'S POST-COLD WAR VOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By As told to Robert Scheer, Times Contributing Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Geoffrey Cowan, 52, the newly appointed director of the Voice of America, is 
an attorney and lecturer in communications at UCLA. He established the Los 
Angeles City Ethics Commission and is former director of California Common 
Cause.  
</P>
<P>
 I had some idea before I took this job of how remarkable the service was, 
because my father had been director of the Voice of America 50 years ago, 
during World War II, and because my sister wrote the definitive book about the 
VOA during the early years. Still, I wasn't prepared for just how much goes on 
in this building and around the world through the Voice of America. 
</P>
<P>
 The VOA is largely unknown to people in America because of a law prohibiting 
it from distributing its programming inside the United States. But it is 
extremely well known in the rest of the world, where it's heard every week by 
more than 100 million listeners in broadcasts delivered in 46 languages to 
every continent. The people who do the broadcasting come from every part of the 
world, so the Voice of America is like a miniature United Nations, filled with 
people who have a very broad perspective of their own countries and a sense of 
the world.  
</P>
<P>
 A lot of people wonder about the efficiency of government. But you come into 
an institution like this and it's inspiring to see how hard these people work 
and how productive they are.  
</P>
<P>
 People in all of these services, in the Indonesian service or the Hindi 
service or the Afghan service or the Russian service turn out programming, 
because they know that there are people around the world who won't get accurate 
and reliable news or news about America if they don't get it from the VOA. 
</P>
<P>
 If you come here (to the VOA studios in Washington) at 4 in the morning, there 
are still hundreds of people delivering the news to the world, because we 
follow the sun as it goes around the globe. So at every moment, there is a 
morning show going on someplace in the world. Our programs introduce the world 
to American culture, to American artists, American ideas, as well as present 
information that has to be reliable. And while some people might assume that as 
a government-financed institution, our programming would be skewed, by law our 
news programming has to be accurate, objective, balanced and comprehensive.  
</P>
<P>
 We're very concerned that our reporting be balanced and objective. We have to 
be. The Croatian and Serbian services, which are virtually right next to each 
other in this building, are broadcasting to the people in the region. It's not 
like American news services, which are mainly heard or read by people who have 
no way of judging how accurate the coverage of another part of the world is. 
You know if it's accurate if it's in your own neighborhood.  
</P>
<P>
 And people listen. Our programming in Tibet, for example, is probably the 
major way that people in Tibet are getting news from the outside world. We're 
in North Korea, China and many other countries where reliable information is at 
a premium. The rebels in Chiapas, Mexico, said the only news that they could 
trust as being accurate was from the BBC and the VOA.  
</P>
<P>
 We just ran an editorial -- we have editorials that present some points of 
view of the American government -- criticizing the government of Ethiopia for 
arresting some journalists. And the head of the journalists' organization was 
released from jail a few days later.  
</P>
<P>
 I would like to redefine the VOA's role, post-Cold War, and to make clear that 
it is as important an institution as ever. The agency started in a hot war, in 
World War II, and had many roles beyond presenting America's viewpoint as 
contrasted with the viewpoint of the Soviet Union. Even then, that was only one 
perspective.  
</P>
<P>
 We're living in an era of turbulence; the world is filled with national 
hatreds and ethnic hatreds and confusion about the world's future. In such a 
period of history, it's in some ways more important than ever to have a voice 
of sanity in the world, and that's what the VOA tries to represent. 
</P>
<P>
 At its best, the VOA represents the diversity of the peoples of America, who 
of course reflect the diversity of the people in the world. It describes 
American institutions with all of their weaknesses, as well as their strengths. 
It's probably the least expensive way that America has of helping to introduce 
models of freedom, democracy and the diversity of cultures in a world in which 
people from different religious and ethnic and national backgrounds are at war.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE SIMPSON CASE; WE GAUGE OUR INNER STRUGGLES AND HOPE WE'RE 
DIFFERENT; PART OF OUR FASCINATION WITH THE MEDIA FRENZY IS VOYEURISM, BUT PART 
IS A CATHARSIS OF OUR OWN POTENTIAL FOR VIOLENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GOULSTON, Mark S. Goulston is a psychiatrist in private practice in 
Santa Monica and an assistant clinical professor at UCLA. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I went by O.J. Simpson's house to watch the "tabloid mania." What a zoo. What 
a travesty of human dignity. What a violation of privacy. What an intrusion on 
personal suffering. What a voyeuristic, prurient feeding frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 So why did I do it, and why did I stay glued to the television Friday night 
during that long, bizarre chase? Is being a voyeur of the voyeurs any less 
voyeuristic? I like to see myself as above prurience and in control of my more 
base instincts. But the truth is that I am drawn to such tabloid scenes, as are 
so many millions of us, to get some vicarious excitement and for something more 
important. Voyeurism helps us cope as much as it excites us. It does this in a 
two-step fashion. First we make an emotional connection to the event to 
experience a vicarious catharsis and relief. Then we find a way to disclaim our 
connection to the experience in order to reassure ourselves that it won't 
happen to us. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these dramas have horrifying and terrifying components. Most of us 
have known horror and terror in our own lives and have usually endured it 
alone. But when we and others are now drawn to the same scene, we all get to 
feel vulnerability together. And as the aloneness lessens, we feel relieved. 
Remember how we felt such catharsis and camaraderie after the riots, fires and 
earthquakes? 
</P>
<P>
 In the Simpson case, our identification is with our own fear of losing control 
or becoming vulnerable to another who might lose control. We become 
frighteningly aware of our potential to explode when the pressures from the 
outside world, from inside our families and inside our minds, override all of 
our control mechanisms. The agitation builds and compels us to precipitous 
action that defies judgment and ignores consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 When I've asked most men I know who initiated a divorce, "What was the last 
straw?" they may mention incompatibility of values, poor communication or even 
not enough sex. But finally, what it comes down to for many men is feeling the 
possibility of violence toward someone they were pledged to protect from harm. 
When a man feels cornered from all sides and there is no outlet, his choices 
seem simple: go crazy, kill the offending agents or kill yourself. In the most 
tragic cases we see all three. After murder relieves an unbearable Angst, the 
anger subsides. The killer then sees clearly what he has done, and can't live 
with; then the only choice is often to kill oneself. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the ways we cope with these demons inside us is to be voyeuristically 
drawn to inhuman acts of humans toward each other. We are able to identify with 
the victim, the victimizer, the rage and the outrage without it happening to us 
directly. It's like going to a bloody movie where we are drawn to the violence 
for cathartic identification and then feel the relief that it was just 
make-believe. 
</P>
<P>
 We also look for some disclaimer to reassure ourselves that we are not the 
same as the participants. We'll look for alcohol if we are not drinkers, for 
guns if we don't own one, for a mixed marriage, for a different ethnic 
background, for divorce if we are married, for marriage if we are divorced, for 
a violent location like Los Angeles if we live in some other part of the 
country or some other explanation to reassure ourselves that we are 
sufficiently unlike these people to have it happen to us.  
</P>
<P>
 But the more someone could be like us, or as in this case, someone we want to 
be, the less we are able to disclaim our similarity, the more compelling and 
disturbing it becomes. A friend of victim Ron Goldman expressed it when he said 
he couldn't comprehend how his childhood hero could be suspected of killing his 
best friend. Because voyeurism fails when we can't distance and reassure 
ourselves, people resorted to denial, cheering his freeway flight like he was 
an underdog hero running for the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 Women are immune to this sort of voyeurism, though it is usually directed 
differently. Many mothers are riveted to stories about child abuse because they 
know inside how close they feel they are to abusing when a child won't stop 
crying or nagging or misbehaving. Women also want to feel that identification 
and that relief from aloneness when they are struggling with impulses that 
threaten to overwhelm them. So they eagerly read these tabloid stories to 
identify, relate, resonate and then find a disclaimer to reassure themselves. 
"Oh, that mother was poor (or newly immigrant or abused). That's not me. I 
won't act on it. I'm safe. My children are safe." 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, none of us is in as much danger as we fear, but none of us is as 
safe as we'd like. 
</P>
<P>
 The real answer is in confronting the bad situations in our lives and finding 
resolution. But for many of us, coping through voyeurism can offer temporary 
relief through cathartic identification and reassurance that since we're 
different, it won't happen to us.

THE POPE FURTHER ERODES HIS AUTHORITY; WOMEN: THE LETTER ON FEMALE ORDINATION 
WEAKENS THE CHURCH AND IS DESTINED TO BE REVERSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGH MONTEFIORE, The Rt. Rev. Hugh Montefiore is the retired bishop of 
Birmingham, England. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pope's recent Apostolic letter to his bishops reaffirming the ban against 
women priests was obviously timed to counter the Church of England's ordination 
of 1,000 women to the priesthood over the last few weeks, and the outpourings 
of joy that so many have experienced. The Pope has written as strongly as he 
can without invoking papal infallibility, but he comes as close as he can to 
it, recalling his Petrine office by a reference to "confirming the brethren" 
(but what about confirming the faith of the sisters?). He produces what seem to 
Episcopalians as the same old tired arguments. The Pope insists that the church 
"has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women," and 
asserts that "this judgment is to be definitively held by all the church's 
faithful," with Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger adding that anyone who does not do so 
"obviously separates himself from the faith of the church." 
</P>
<P>
 These strong words seek to stifle growing sympathy for women priests in the 
Roman church and to counteract the warm welcome that Anglican women priests 
have received from so many Roman Catholics. My daily newspaper had four letters 
on the subject (all from Roman Catholics). Three were strongly in favor; the 
exception was a recent convert from Anglicanism on this account. When I 
preached recently at the first celebration of a newly ordained woman, two Roman 
Catholic priests were present. 
</P>
<P>
 This papal statement will not greatly worry Episcopalians because, while they 
respect the Pope, they do not acknowledge his authority, and he does not 
recognize their male orders anyway. For Roman Catholics, however, the matter is 
different. Authoritative statements of this kind have to be acceptable to the 
church as a whole, and if this is not the case, they may eventually be subject 
to revision. This has happened within the Roman Catholic Church before. For 
example, the medieval ban on interest from loans has never been formally 
revoked, but it is no longer operative. The doctrine of no salvation outside 
the church, which earlier popes affirmed, has been so modified that adherents 
of other faiths are now said to be within the sphere of salvation. In 1864, 
Pope Pius VIII published the "syllabus of errors," which was later completely 
abandoned. In the last century, popes inveighed against democracy; now this 
attitude has been reversed completely. Less than a century ago, the Bible was 
regarded by popes as inerrant and written at the dictation of the Holy Spirit, 
but a recent statement on biblical studies puts the Pontifical Biblical 
Commission in the vanguard of modern biblical criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 These hiccups have been fairly easily contained in the past, when 
authoritarianism was acceptable. Now things are different. The 1968 document 
"Humanae Vitae" (against artificial contraception) was found unacceptable by 
many Roman Catholics because they are no longer prepared to receive 
authoritarian teaching that seems to them unreasonable. Even the Duke of 
Norfolk, the leading Roman Catholic layman here in Britain, came out against 
it. Similarly, the Pope's insistence on no abortion under any circumstances 
whatsoever has not improved his standing in many peoples' eyes, especially 
women, who feel that such matters should not be decided by elderly unmarried 
gentlemen. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of all this is a sad loss of the Pope's authority within his own 
church. I fear it will be the same over the ordination of women. Many women 
feel affronted by the Pope's strong language. Eventually, of course, the Roman 
Catholic veto on women priests is bound to be reversed, as in the West more and 
more women feel a priestly vocation, and there are fewer and fewer male 
priests. (In England and Wales, there are only 71 men in training for the Roman 
Catholic priesthood, and half of them may be expected to drop out before 
ordination.) But the recent strong words of the Pope will make it hard for his 
eventual successor to permit women priests very quickly. We Episcopalians in 
Britain are sad that the great Church of Rome seems, under present management, 
determined to give itself such a handicap.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; IT'S THE SWEDES WHO ROAR BACK; GROUP B: 
CAMEROON HAS TO SETTLE FOR 2-2 TIE BEFORE 83,959 AT THE ROSE BOWL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Everyone who watched the Lions of Cameroon play in their second World Cup four 
years ago knew they would at the least provide entertainment in this one. 
Considering the distractions they have faced off the field, however, hardly 
anyone expected them to be as successful as they were in Italy, where they 
became the first African team to reach the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a 2-2 tie with a confident Sweden team before 83,959 fans at the 
Rose Bowl on Sunday, who knows? As their nickname boasts, perhaps the Lions are 
indomitable. 
</P>
<P>
 They were as committed to an all-out offensive attack as they were in 1990, 
and their defense under Coach Henri Michel was more disciplined. That doesn't 
mean that they are really disciplined -- only more disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
 Michel, the French coach when they won the Olympic gold medal 10 years ago in 
the same stadium where his Lions opened World Cup play Sunday, complained that 
they lost their concentration near the end of the game, allowing Sweden to 
equalize in the 75th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 It had seemed unlikely that the Swedes would do so after wilting in the heat, 
which was reported in the low 90s at the 4:30 p.m. kickoff. They complained 
afterward that the conditions favored the Cameroonians, who responded that they 
had no advantage because so many of them play professionally in Europe instead 
of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever, the Swedes were certainly feeling the heat from the Lions when Coach 
Tommy Svensson sent on 22-year-old midfielder Henrik Larsson in the 61st 
minute. That move paid dividends 13 minutes later when he boomed a shot from 35 
yards out that hit the crossbar.  
</P>
<P>
 Cameroon's veteran goalkeeper, 40-year-old Joseph-Antoine Bell, faltered in 
reacting to the rebound, which forward Martin Dahlin slipped past him in the 
75th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 That came only four minutes after Bell had taken too many steps with the ball 
before a goal kick, a violation that resulted in an indirect free kick from 
just inside the penalty area for Sweden.  
</P>
<P>
 Known at home as "the Black Pearl," Dahlin brought the yellow-shirted Swedish 
fans to their feet by appearing to score on the ensuing flurry in front of the 
goal, but he had touched the ball with his hand first.  
</P>
<P>
 Dahlin received an automatic yellow card for that, but the episode was an 
encouraging one for the Swedes because it gave them hope that the Lions could 
be had. Thus revived, the Swedes soon had them. 
</P>
<P>
 Svensson said his team in the final minutes was "real brave." 
</P>
<P>
 Semifinalists in the 1992 European Championships in Denmark, Sweden showed 
during the first 20 minutes why some, including several of its players, 
predicted it would be a force in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 In the seventh minute, midfielder Jonas Thern found no one near the far post 
except three of his teammates and sent his free kick in that direction. It was 
an easy header into the net for defender Roger Ljung. 
</P>
<P>
 Would the Lions disintegrate? After all, reports from Cameroon were that they 
were on the verge of it even before they arrived at their Oxnard training camp 
because of interfering soccer federation and government officials, missed 
paychecks and substandard training conditions. But the Lions do not go down 
easily. In nine World Cup games since 1982, they have lost only twice. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been various reports of disharmony within the Cameroon team," Bell 
said. "Our play today shows these reports are not true." 
</P>
<P>
 Cameroon got its attack organized about 20 minutes into the game and took 
control after an odd goal 10 minutes later tied the score. After a Cameroon 
charge, defender Patrik Andersson tried to clear the ball out of the area only 
to have it blocked by midfielder Marc Vivien Foe, who suddenly was a threat to 
score. When Sweden goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli challenged him, Foe tapped the 
ball to forward David Embe, who scored into an empty net.  
</P>
<P>
 The Swedes argued that Embe was offside, but referee Alberto Tejada Noriega of 
Peru, after conferring with linesman Douglas James of Trinidad and Tobago, 
ruled that it was a goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameroon took the lead only two minutes into the second half when forward 
Francois Omam-Biyick beat Andersson, again the foil, to defender Hans Agbo's 
long ball and dribbled over a lunging Ravelli and into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden would have been looking at a 2-1 defeat, the result of each of its 
three games in the 1990 World Cup, against most teams, but Cameroon is not most 
teams.  
</P>
<P>
 For that, the soccer world is grateful. But Michel no doubt would have found 
the game more enjoyable if his team had retreated into a defensive posture to 
preserve the victory. Instead, the Lions insisted on continuing to apply the 
heat, and it was they who got burned. Still, it is heartening to know that the 
rumors of their demise were exaggerated.

ROCKETS KEEP HOPES FOR TITLE IN THE FRAME; NBA FINALS: SMITH'S THREE-POINT 
SHOT, OLAJUWON'S DEFENSE HELP BEAT THE KNICKS, 86-84, FORCING A GAME 7 ON 
WEDNESDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 He was going for inspiration, so Knick guard Derek Harper brought the 
full-page black-and-white newspaper picture from New York and hung it in his 
locker stall, the one of Mark Messier hoisting the Stanley Cup in celebration. 
And now Harper will leave it up three more days. 
</P>
<P>
 He has to. The Knicks are not going home today with their own championship 
trophy, after all. They will play here again Wednesday, an inconvenience forced 
upon them by the Houston Rockets, who used the heroics of Hakeem Olajuwon to 
win Game 6 Sunday night, 86-84, tying the NBA finals and forcing Game 7 at the 
Summit. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the biggest wins in Rocket history," said their coach, Rudy 
Tomjanovich. 
</P>
<P>
 One of? 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks could have won their first championship since 1973 and might have 
done it if a three-point attempt by John Starks, on a shooting tear in the 
fourth quarter, hadn't been blocked by Olajuwon with about a second left. 
</P>
<P>
 That Starks would be in such a bad mood because of the turn of events that he 
refused to talk to reporters after the game is no more startling than who 
played a key role for the Rockets: Kenny Smith. The same Kenny Smith who had a 
tenuous hold on his job as the starting point guard and had made only nine of 
27 shots, including three of 11 three-point attempts, when his big moment came 
in the fourth quarter. Then he made a three-pointer with 3:18 left that 
provided an 84-77 lead and prompted a Knick timeout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't look at it as vindication or redemption," said Smith, getting rare 
playing time down the stretch because Sam Cassell had five fouls. 
</P>
<P>
 "We win together as a team and we lose together as a team. Tonight, we won 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tomjanovich: "That was probably the biggest shot of his career. As the 
ball was in the air, I was pulling for the guy so much." 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out to be the Rockets' final field goal of the game, and the Knicks 
took advantage to close within 84-82 on a three-pointer by Starks with 1:17 
remaining, his third of the fourth quarter and the last of his 16 points in the 
period. Then, suddenly, things started to go wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The next time downcourt, he drove the left side, saw Olajuwon start to come 
over to cut him off and tried to pass to Patrick Ewing on the baseline. But the 
pass went right into Olajuwon's arms, and his two free throws made the score 
86-82 with 39 seconds to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Mason made a baseline jumper to draw the Knicks within 86-84 with 32 
seconds left, and after the Rockets could manage only an off-balance 18-footer 
by Smith, Mason grabbed the rebound and New York called timeout with 7.6 
seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets had one foul to give, and used that advantage when Robert Horry 
grabbed Starks a few feet beyond the three-point line, forcing the Knicks to 
bring the ball in again with 5.5 seconds remaining. This time, Starks got the 
ball near midcourt and drove left. As he did the last time the Knick guard made 
the same move, Olajuwon left his man, Ewing, only this time Starks didn't have 
time to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 So he pulled up to shoot in front of the Rocket bench. 
</P>
<P>
 A foul would have been extra costly, because Starks would have gotten two free 
throws for a chance to tie and Olajuwon would have fouled out with the Rockets 
facing possible overtime. The Houston center contested the shot anyway, making 
sure not to go for a pump fake and then using his entire jump and extension of 
the right arm to go for the block. 
</P>
<P>
 "I already got beat," he said. "I didn't have time to take another step to get 
closer." 
</P>
<P>
 He got close enough. The shot deflected off his fingertips. 
</P>
<P>
 "The great players make the great plays," Rocket swingman Mario Elie said. 
"And that's what he did. He stepped up." 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of four blocks for Olajuwon, who had 30 points and 10 rebounds in 
43 minutes, the last 6:10 of which was under the additional burden of five 
fouls. 
</P>
<P>
 He also held Ewing, with some double-team help, to 17 points on six-of-20 
shooting and a scoreless fourth quarter, although the Knick center did get 15 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very disheartening loss for us," New York Coach Pat Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had an opportunity, and they won it. Now it gets thrown up in the air 
Wednesday night in a seventh game." 
</P>
<P>
 * THE BEST: The Rockets' Hakeem Olajuwon proves he is the No. 1 center by 
outplaying the Knicks' Patrick Ewing. C10

THEY FIND DELIGHT IN PIAZZA; DODGERS: HE GETS CURTAIN CALL FROM CROWD OF 51,015 
AS HIS SECOND GRAND SLAM FUELS A 7-3 VICTORY OVER THE ROCKIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It doesn't happen often for Mike Piazza, so accustomed to his exceptional 
talent has the home crowd become. The last time he had been called out of the 
Dodger dugout for a curtain call was the final game of last season, not only in 
appreciation for an exceptional game, but for an incredible season. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, before 51,015 at Dodger Stadium, Piazza hit his second grand slam of 
the season and had five runs batted in during the Dodgers' 7-3 victory over the 
Colorado Rockies, and he was recognized for it. He is the first Dodger since 
Todd Benzinger in 1992 to hit two grand slams in a season. The most any Dodger, 
Brooklyn or L.A., has hit in a season is three, which Kal Daniels did in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was the first time this year," Piazza said of his curtain call. 
"It was nice, exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics wondered if Piazza could repeat his rookie-of-the-year performance 
this season, and when he got off to a slow start the first two weeks, the talk 
increased. But Piazza, even more patient and mature than last season, proved 
that he is for real.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to change anything," said Piazza, who is batting .343 with 15 
home runs through 68 games. His 65 RBIs share the National League lead with 
Houston's Jeff Bagwell. 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza, batting against reliever Kent Bottenfield in the seventh inning, sent 
a 1-and-2 fastball about 10 rows up in the upper section of the left-field 
pavilion. It was the second grand slam of his career and the third time in his 
career he has had five RBIs in a game. "They were pitching me inside all day, a 
lot of teams do, but sooner or later they will make a mistake and I have to be 
ready and basically that's what happened," Piazza said. "It helps to go up to 
the plate with guys on base, because they have to come to you and it makes you 
more patient." 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado starter Kevin Ritz (1-4) held the Dodgers hitless until the fourth 
inning, when Tim Wallach singled to center. Ritz retired the next five until, 
in the sixth inning, the Dodgers got five consecutive hits, including a 
run-scoring single by Piazza and a two-run double by Henry Rodriguez. The 
Dodgers loaded the bases in the seventh on a single by starter Pedro Astacio 
and two walks before Ritz was relieved by Bottenfield with Piazza at bat.  
</P>
<P>
 "Piazza's not that good, he doesn't swing the bat that well and he is slow 
behind the plate," Brett Butler, who has a seven-game hitting streak, said 
sarcastically. "You know, everybody talks about Ken Griffey being the best 
player in the game. Well, I have never seen anybody who hits the ball as hard 
and as far as Mike Piazza." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Astacio (5-5), who began the game by walking leadoff batter Eric 
Young and giving up a single to Walt Weiss, didn't give up another hit until 
the seventh, when Andres Galarraga singled and moved to second when Charlie 
Hayes' grounder bounced off Jose Offerman's glove for an error. A second 
fielding error by Offerman enabled Galarraga to score the Rockies' first run. 
They scored two more against Astacio in the ninth, one on a throwing error by 
Raul Mondesi, before Todd Worrell came in and retired the final two batters. 
Astacio has given up one earned run in his last 17 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing six consecutive games to the Rockies at Dodger Stadium, dating to 
last season, the Dodgers were relieved to put this victory away. The first two 
games of the series, they were pummeled by the Rockies, who had 33 hits, 10 for 
extra bases, and scored 22 runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed this. . . . The last couple of nights have been awful for us, " 
said Rodriguez, who batted .438 with two doubles and five runs batted in during 
the six-game home stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza's first grand slam was hit June 6 at Joe Robbie Stadium, a 477-foot 
shot to center field that was the longest ever hit at the stadium. Of all the 
home runs in the major leagues this season, it ranks third in length. 
</P>
<P>
 His power notwithstanding, a key for Piazza is his poise and patience at the 
plate, a trait not usually found so consistently in a young player. But he had 
it last season, when, after a brief slow start, he went on to enjoy one of the 
most celebrated rookie seasons ever in baseball. Does this season remind him of 
where he was a year ago? 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't remember back that far," he said, smiling.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; MEXICO HAS NO CAPITAL OFFENSE; GROUP E: 
NORWAY WINS, 1-0, ON REKDAL'S GOAL IN 85TH MINUTE. ALVES' LATE HEADER HITS 
POST. 
</P>

<P>
 A carnival of humanity with soccer as catalyst swept joyfully through the 
nation's capital Sunday. But Norway short-circuited the fiesta with a late goal 
that spoiled Mexico's first World Cup game since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1-0 final under brutal playing conditions at RFK Stadium -- 96 degrees at 
the start of the game -- established the credentials of both sides in Group E, 
the Cup's toughest division. But the outcome before a near-sellout crowd of 
52,395 casts a shadow over Mexico's hopes of advancing beyond the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first Group E games, Norway and Ireland each have three points and 
Italy and Mexico have none. Italy will play Norway on Thursday at East 
Rutherford, N.J., and Ireland and Mexico will play at Orlando, Fla., on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a stadium primped in red, white and green and throbbing for Mexico, the 
game, as advertised, pitted Latin finesse against Nordic strength. In the end, 
the big guys beat the little guys -- by the skin of their teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing a British-style zone defense and an offense based on long-pass 
counterattack, the Norwegians, one of the biggest teams in the tournament, were 
physically commanding, particularly in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice in the first half, the ball went in after scrums in front of the Mexican 
net. Both times, Hungarian referee Sandor Puhl disallowed the apparent 
Norwegian goals because of fouls. And twice he issued yellow cards to Norway 
for rough play. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in the 85th minute that the Mexican defense finally yielded when 
midfielder Kjetil Rekdal deftly fielded a pass from Jan Age Fjortoft to climax 
a brisk Norwegian attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Rekdal, who plays professional soccer in Belgium, cleanly beat Claudio Suarez 
and Mexican goalkeeper Jorge Campos with a right-footer to the left side of the 
net. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were lucky to get the goal," Norwegian Coach Egil Olsen said. "They were 
tougher than we thought."  
</P>
<P>
 Again and again, Mexican short-pass attacks down the middle were stopped by 
the Norwegian zone defense. Quick defenders and total control of the air 
spelled the difference for Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've come to confirm what we already know. The Norwegians can be very 
obstructive," said Ireland Coach Jack Charlton, an interested spectator. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Norwegian goal, the Mexicans, who outshot Norway, 14-10, battled 
desperately for a tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by strikers Luis Roberto Alves, Hugo Sanchez and Luis Garcia, they 
repeatedly pounded the flagging Norwegian defense. A header by Alves hit the 
right post in the closing moments and the rebound was cleared by the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tough, hard-played game," Mexican Coach Miguel Mejia Baron said. 
"I'm proud of how the Mexican players behaved on the field. We went for three 
points and didn't get them. Now we know what we have to do in the two remaining 
games."  
</P>
<P>
 What Mexico lost on the field, it won in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 William Montana, selling oversized Mexico T-shirts outside the stadium, said 
Mexico was a euphemism Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody from south of the border is Mexican today," Montana said. "None of us 
Latinos have ever had a chance to see our game played at this level in the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
 When Antonio Chavez led a complex Mexican cheer on a Metro train at 
Washington's Foggy Bottom station, Peruvian Marco Chung smiled with delight at 
the American passengers watching nonplussed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans simply don't know what it's like to get up for a big soccer game," 
Chung said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chitiboom, chitiboom. . . . " the Chavez chant began, " . . . Mexico, Mexico, 
Rah, Rah, Rah!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Not a lot of atmosphere in the United States for soccer games, so we'll make 
our own atmosphere," said Chavez, who came from Mexico City with six relatives 
and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer player Frederick Roed, in from Oslo with friends, wore his team shirt 
in Norwegian national colors of red, blue and white, and watched with amusement 
as the Mexican legions paraded past him, jeering good-naturedly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are fewer, but on the field we speak louder," Roed said. "In fact, though, 
the atmosphere is very friendly, everywhere we have gone. We've been playing 
soccer at Georgetown University every afternoon -- and we've even found 
Americans to play with," Roed said.

SANDERSON HAUNTS THE ANGELS, 7-1; BASEBALL: PITCHER THEY RELEASED LAST SEASON 
STOPS THEM ON THREE HITS FOR THE WHITE SOX. FABREGAS IS INJURED IN PLAY AT 
PLATE. 
</P>

 The Angels stared at the scoreboard Sunday afternoon in disbelief. The feeling 
of frustration had passed. This was now embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was in the seventh inning, and they were being no-hit by former 
teammate Scott Sanderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel starter Chuck Finley said, "Guys were coming back to the bench saying, 
'Scott Sanderson, you've got to be kidding me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels finally foiled the no-hitter when Chili Davis hit a two-out double 
in the seventh, but it did nothing to ease Finley's disgust once the Chicago 
White Sox's 7-1 victory at Comiskey Park was complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was almost like we were all so happy that we won three of four," Finley 
said. " 'That's good enough. Oh well, let's throw this one away.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like we weren't into it, which was sad, because we had a chance to 
do something. Not to take anything away from Scott, but it's like we just 
conceded the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "If these comments make some people unhappy, I really don't care. The people 
who are unhappy are the people I'm not talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 Finley acknowledged his share of blame, after yielding 11 hits and seven runs 
-- six earned -- in 4 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not pointing fingers at anyone," said Finley, who is 5-6 with a 4.54 
earned-run average. "I probably had as much to do with it as anybody. I was 
disappointed in my outing, but more disappointed in the whole overall 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're nine games under .500, and you have the chance to take all four 
games (against the White Sox), you go for it. You look back at teams that end 
up winning a lot of games, and they have that killer instinct. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who won four of the seven games on their trip, self-destructed in 
the fourth inning when they incurred yet another bizarre injury to one of their 
catchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading 2-0, the White Sox had runners on first and third with one out when 
Joey Cora dropped a bunt down the third base line. As Darrin Jackson broke for 
the plate, third baseman Rex Hudler charged the ball, but his off-balance throw 
bounced in the dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Jorge Fabregas reached to pick up the ball, and Jackson slid into 
home, stood up, and the top of his helmet slammed into Fabregas' mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 A dazed Fabregas, who lost two teeth, began walking away while the ball kept 
rolling toward the backstop. The Angel bench started screaming for someone to 
pick up the ball. Bob Zupcic, who was on first, kept running before the Angels 
realized that Fabregas was incapable of retrieving the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys were yelling, 'Get the ball! Get the ball!' " said teammate Chris 
Turner, "but he was out of it. He was looking toward the dugout, dazed." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time first baseman J.T. Snow grabbed the ball, Zupcic was on his way 
home. Snow threw the ball to Hudler, but it was too late. The White Sox had two 
runs on a bunt, and Fabregas had to leave the game for an examination by the 
White Sox team dentist before meeting the team at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry I got him messed up like that with my throw," said Hudler, who was 
taken out of the game in the seventh inning because of a tender shoulder. "He 
lost his teeth because of my throw. I apologized to Finley, and everybody on 
the field." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels released Sanderson last July after he lost nine consecutive 
decisions following a 7-2 start. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanderson, 37, joined the White Sox in February, and spent Sunday letting the 
Angels know they might have made a mistake. Sanderson pitched a three-hit 
complete game, and at 5-2, now has as many victories as any Angel pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there was some interest in me," Sanderson said of the Angels this 
spring, "but not a high enough level. . . . That's all right, this worked out 
the best for me anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just a coincidence that I keep pitching for teams that are near or 
in first place."

MORNING BRIEFING: THIS OUTLOOK IS DECIDEDLY UNWORLDLY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Eisenberg of the Baltimore Sun has a primer for the World Cup such as 
"seeing as 71% of the country doesn't even even know that the World Cup is 
being played in the United States." A random sampling:  
</P>
<P>
 " F is for football, the name soccer goes by everywhere else in the world 
except here. Have you ever thought that maybe they're right and we're wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 " I is for the insurmountable 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 " W is for wives and girlfriends, banned from the Swiss and German team 
hotels. Strictly verbotten.  
</P>
<P>
 " Z is for the snores of American couch potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who are the four golfers who have won the U.S. Open, British 
Open, Masters and PGA Championship? 
</P>
<P>
 Phone trap: In a Morning Briefing item on May 18, Martina Navratilova said she 
was bothered by cellular telephones ringing in the crowd at the Italian Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Her agitation amused reader Carl Esser, who said that while riding his 
motorcycle last summer in Universal City, he was nearly run off the road by 
Navratilova. "She failed to see me," Esser said, "because she was engrossed in 
a conversation on her cellular phone." 
</P>
<P>
 Polite loser: Bolivia Coach Xavier Azkargorta, after his team lost a 
controversial 1-0 World Cup game to Germany on Friday: "The referee was too 
intransigent. I would have liked to see whether he would have been as 
intransigent with a player from a big team." 
</P>
<P>
 Considerably mild compared to frustrated howls from losing coaches in American 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Bora babble: C.W. Nevius of the San Francisco Chronicle, on Bora Milutinovic, 
coach of the U.S. soccer team:  
</P>
<P>
 "Bora is wonderfully cooperative with the media. He speaks to everyone. There 
is one small problem. No one has any idea what he is talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 Wait a minute: An Associated Press story said that Trinidad cricket star Brian 
Lara's joining an English team "is a signing coup comparable to Babe Ruth's 
sale from the Boston Red Sox to the New York Yankees in 1920." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back: On this day in 1955, Jack Fleck beat Ben Hogan by three strokes 
in a playoff to win the U.S. Open at the Olympic Club in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Choices: From David Letterman: "Phil Donahue says he'll go to the Supreme 
Court for the right to televise an execution on his show. And he says if they 
won't let him, he'll do the next best thing and show a Chicago Cubs game." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Gene Sarazen, Hogan, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Russian soccer Coach Pavel Sadyrin, on his country's chances of 
winning the World Cup: "If we win, it will be a miracle on the scale of flying 
saucers." MAL FLORENCE

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 Most sportswriters have personal favorites. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Usually it is the second-string offensive tackle, the third-base coach or the 
journeyman fighter who has a gift of gab and loves to see his name in the 
newspaper. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Mine was the 1968 Heisman Trophy winner and former NFL single-season rushing 
record holder. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I was at Shea Stadium on a snowy December afternoon in 1973 when O.J. Simpson 
of the Buffalo Bills ran for 200 yards against the New York Jets to finish the 
season with 2,003. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 After answering questions from dozens of reporters in the dressing room for 
the better part of an hour, he called me over and asked if there was anything 
more that I needed. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He hadn't changed since the USC days. He was patient, insightful and humorous, 
and he made my job easier. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 That is the O.J. I knew from work, and it is what makes the mind-boggling 
events of the past few days even more difficult to fathom. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The former No. 32 is now prisoner No. 4013970 in L.A. County Jail, expected to 
be arraigned today on charges that he fatally stabbed his ex-wife and her male 
friend. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In a note that was read Friday before the low-speed freeway chase that riveted 
television watchers throughout the nation, Simpson said that people shouldn't 
feel sorry for him. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, they should feel sorry, instead, for the families of the late Nicole 
Brown Simpson and the late Ronald Goldman. . . . 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 This might not be the most scintillating NBA championship series, but it will 
be the longest since the Lakers beat the Detroit Pistons, 108-105, in Game 7 at 
the Forum on June 21, 1988. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Houston Rocket Coach Rudy Tomjanovich, who has done an excellent job this 
year, was treated shabbily during the pregame buildup on NBC on Friday when New 
York Knick Coach Pat Riley got all the praise. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 John Starks will cure you or kill you. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Colin Montgomerie, Ernie Els and Loren Roberts? Not exactly your dream 
threesome, but their 18-hole playoff for the U.S. Open championship should make 
for good television today. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 This is the best way to decide a major championship, much fairer than sudden 
death. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't so much the lack of scoring, but the dearth of scoring opportunities 
that often makes World Cup soccer appear dull to the unsophisticated viewer. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody could blame the announcer when, before South Korea rallied in the last 
few minutes at the Cotton Bowl, he described Spain's 2-0 lead as 
"commanding."... 
</P>
<P>
 ESPN is saying proudly that its World Cup telecasts are commercial-free, but 
that box in the upper left corner that shows the sponsors' names along with the 
time elapsed is irritating. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 And when updates on other sports events are shown in the lower half of the 
screen every half hour, the space devoted to the action is much too small. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer cliche: "Good result." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Best-dressed team: Cameroon. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Best rule: No timeouts except for injuries. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar De La Hoya-Jorge Paez, James Toney-Prince Charles Williams is set as an 
HBO doubleheader July 29 from the MGM Grand Garden in Las Vegas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie McCoy, who has managed or trained six world champions, is back working 
in the gym after suffering a blackout recently. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 How can the New York Giants, who released Phil Simms, expect to contend for a 
championship without a quality veteran quarterback?. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Rangers might be aging, but, according to a Hockey News survey, 
they and the Quebec Nordiques have more good NHL prospects in their systems 
than any other team. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Piazza is tearing up the National League in his sophomore year -- 11 of 
his 15 home runs have come with men on base -- but there is little need to 
project his numbers over a full season because of the impending strike. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Pity, too, that Ken Griffey Jr., who makes his first local appearance of the 
year tonight with the Seattle Mariners at Anaheim Stadium, probably will be 
deprived of an opportunity to hit at least 62 home runs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Griffey's total should be put in the record book, anyway, with an 
asterisk and an explanation: "Would have broken Roger Maris' record if not for 
strike." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I can't understand why some people are saying Ryne Sandberg hurt his chances 
for induction into the Hall of Fame when he retired early. By any reckoning, 
the former Chicago Cub second baseman should be a cinch. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Cincinnati Reds might need some convincing about the greatness of the 
Atlanta Braves' pitching staff. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry's signing with the San Francisco Giants is a boost to the 
Dodgers' pennant chances.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; GETTING HERE NOT EASY FOR CAMEROON; GROUP 
B: AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE THEY'VE SEEN, LIONS ARE HAPPY WITH A TIE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Amid sweltering on-field temperatures and incessant in-house bickering, the 
Indomitable Lions of Cameroon played Sweden evenly Sunday at the Rose Bowl in 
the first match of Group B round-robin competition in the 1994 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, to put it in lay terms for the average American sports fan, the Lions tied 
the Vikings in their season opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameroon blew a big lead -- it was 2-1 before the Swedes tied it in the 75th 
minute on a ricochet off the crossbar and a put-in by Martin Dahlin -- but the 
Lions still walked away feeling as if they had pulled off a fast one. 
</P>
<P>
 "There can be no disappointment," goalkeeper Joseph-Antoine Bell said, "if you 
know what has happened with this team. There is no reason to expect a team with 
the amount of problems we have to win against a team with no problems at all." 
</P>
<P>
 You mean the Swedes don't need their coach to fish into his own pocket to 
provide his players with the bare necessities of life -- bottled water and 
soccer balls? 
</P>
<P>
 You mean in Sweden, it's not common practice for a player to punch out the 
coach after learning he has been cut from the national team? 
</P>
<P>
 Swedes don't go through four coaches in three years . . . and don't rebel when 
their 1990 World Cup hero is assigned a roster spot on the 1994 team . . . and 
are never forced to cancel a night workout because no one called ahead to turn 
on the lights because the phone company had cut off service? 
</P>
<P>
 Happens all the time in Cameroon, and no wonder they call them Indomitable. 
The other teams arrived at this tournament via customary means -- air and bus 
transport. The Lions got here only by tackling an obstacle course. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has affected us, for sure," Bell said. "Not the play, but the preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have to deal with something else besides football, you are not going 
to pay enough attention to the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell said he doesn't blame anybody, "because we are going forward. At least we 
are going forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, they are. From zero Group B points on Sunday morning to one point by 
sundown, it counts as progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the circumstances, Bell couldn't have asked for more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not the only children God sent on this earth," Bell reasoned. "If you 
go out there with all the problems we have, and at 1:30 you are talking about 
your problems and not football and at 4:30 you go out and beat Sweden, you are 
world champions." 
</P>
<P>
 So Bell could only laugh when he heard of the Swedish players' complaints 
about the oppressive weather conditions at the Rose Bowl on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brother, Bell was in effect saying, Anders and Magnus and Lars do not know the 
trouble I have seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell sat the bench during the 1990 World Cup, even though he is the best 
goalkeeper in the country, because he dared to speak out on behalf of his 
teammates and demand a bigger qualifying bonus than the piddly $6,000 stipend 
they were granted by the Cameroon soccer federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Federation officials listened to Bell's eloquent plea and promptly ordered him 
replaced in the starting lineup by Thomas N'Kono. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Bell has seen the federation hire and fire four coaches; watched 
the latest, Henri Michel, get punched in the face by Jean-Claude Pagal after 
cutting Pagal from the national team; and heard the dressing-room uproar when 
aging Roger Milla was awarded a 1994 roster spot by presidential decree. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat? What heat? 
</P>
<P>
 As if to mock the sweating Swedes, Bell dressed warm for the occasion, pulling 
on long, heat-absorbing black sweat pants and bright yellow leggings over them. 
On a cloudless day, he also wore a black baseball cap for intermittent periods. 
On, off, on, off. With Cameroon forcing most of the action on the other side of 
the field, Bell figured he might as well pass the time by amusing himself. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't seem particularly broken-hearted over the equalizing goal that hit 
the crossbar after tipping off his hands and bounding back to Dahlin, who 
knocked the ball down with his chest and left-footed it inside the left post. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lucky?" Bell said in response to a reporter's query. "You cannot say that, 
because (Dahlin) did what he had to do. If the direction of the ball does not 
go straight, well, that's what football is about." 
</P>
<P>
 All things considered, Bell will take a 2-2 tie and move on. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are doing," he said, "is trying to make good of a bad situation."

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; EXASPERATED SWEDEN DOES A QUIET BOIL; 
GROUP B: SCANDINAVIANS OFFER A CALM AND FRANK EXPLANATION FOR THEIR WOES: BAD 
WEATHER, BAD OFFICIALS, BAD DEFENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Unseasonable weather, unreasonable officials and a decidedly unimpressive 
performance by defender Patrik Andersson all combined to force the Swedes to 
temporarily stray from their national trait known as jantelagen, a certain 
modesty and extreme humility. 
</P>
<P>
 After Sunday's 2-2 tie against Cameroon, the Swedish team wasn't happy with 
the three aforementioned perceived problems and said so, using polite but blunt 
words. No trash talk, mind you. Just a certain measure of disappointment that 
might seem like whining if the Swedish players hadn't been so matter of fact 
and calm. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather was, of course, beyond control. The temperature at the Rose Bowl 
was in the low 90s when the game started at 4:30 in the afternoon. But it was 
no sauna, like the Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich., on Saturday for the United 
States-Switzerland game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was quite hot and it was quite tough for us," defender Joachim Bjorklund 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said forward Martin Dahlin: "The first 30 minutes was terrible and after that 
it was OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli said it was an unusual start time for them. "We 
don't play at this time of day -- we play always in the evening when it isn't 
so hot," he said. "So the Cameroon players had an advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 Cameroon Coach Henri Michel, noticing the problems Sweden had in the heat, 
felt it was a benefit for his team because it usually plays and practices in 
hot conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 But even one of Michel's players disagreed with that notion, scoffing at the 
heat excuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bit of an easy excuse for Sweden to say they were suffering from the 
sun," Cameroon goalkeeper Joseph-Antoine Bell said. "It's not going to get any 
cooler. They better get used to it. Everybody else is playing in it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the players of Cameroon's team play in European clubs week in and 
week out. So for many many weeks before World Cup, we have been playing in a 
European climate, not in the climate of our native country." 
</P>
<P>
 But what really bothered the Swedish team were two of the officials -- referee 
Noriega Tejada of Peru and linesman Douglas James of Trinidad and Tobago. In 
the 31st minute, Andersson botched a clearing attempt and Marc Vivien Foe 
blocked it and chipped it across to David Embe, who scored, after Ravelli had 
committed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedes protested, saying that Cameroon was offside. The goal stood and the 
score was tied, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like that decision at first was that it wasn't a goal and then he 
(the referee) asks him (the linesman) and says it is a goal, then that is a 
little strange," Ravelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Swedish Coach Tommy Svensson also disagreed with the call. Speaking with 
Swedish journalists he said: "The referee was not impressive." He then called 
the linesman a " pajas ."The word pajas apparently is a cross between a clown 
or a joker, according to a Swedish translator. 
</P>
<P>
 Svensson was kinder to Andersson, who visibly struggled the whole game and 
committed miscues on both goals. The second came in the 47th minute when a long 
pass floated over Andersson's head and he turned the wrong way. Ravelli then 
had no chance against Francois Omam-Biyick, who put Cameroon ahead 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "The second goal was a miscue by Patrik," Svensson said. "He was probably 
surprised. It looked like Patrik got the situation under control, but it was a 
miscommunication between two Swedish players." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ravelli: "I thought he should make the ball, as I said before. It was a 
very good ball. It was hard for me to do anything."

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; SPOTLIGHT; WHY THROW AWAY A PERFECTLY GOOD 
CAP? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite 96-degree heat, many of the 10,000 or so Norwegians on hand for the 
1-0 victory over Mexico in Washington wore the same blue-and-white wool Viking 
caps seen at Lillehammer during the Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, it was difficult for many of them to see because of the 
sweat pouring down their red faces.Yet, they refused to discard the caps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every other part of our body is hot, so what is the difference?" asked John 
Fjelde, a teacher from Stevagee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Norwegians also wore cowbells around their necks. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Norway, we use these bells to let us know where to find our sheep and 
cows," said Bard Johnson, a student. "Here, we use the bells so you know where 
to find our fans." BILL PLASCHKE

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; REDS HIT FOUR HOMERS OFF SMOLTZ IN THE FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cincinnati Reds hit a team-record four home runs in the first inning off 
John Smoltz and routed the Atlanta Braves for the second day in a row, 12-4, 
Sunday at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves, with the lowest earned-run average and best record in the major 
leagues, were pounded by the Reds on Saturday night, 16-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati, which battered Smoltz (5-7) for eight hits in the first inning, 
got 20 hits for the second consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitting homers in the seven-run first were Hal Morris, Kevin Mitchell, Jeff 
Branson and Eddie Taubensee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like we got Smoltz a little flustered by hitting the home runs," 
Cincinnati Manager Davey Johnson said. "Then he started throwing his fastball 
harder, but the harder he threw it, the harder we hit it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Smoltz: "I couldn't go out and duplicate that in BP (batting practice). 
What were they hitting? Everything -- fastballs down, fastballs up, fastballs 
down the middle." 
</P>
<P>
 The Reds scored 33 runs and had 50 hits in the three-game series, although 
they lost the opener, 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 10, San Francisco 6 -- While most people at Candlestick Park will 
remember Sunday as the day the Giants signed Darryl Strawberry, Cub pitcher 
Kevin Foster will remember it for other reasons: He collected his first major 
league victory and first hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster (1-1) gave up six hits and five runs, four earned, in 5 1/3 innings. He 
walked three and struck out four. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a rough one trying to control my fastball," he said. "It was rising up 
in the strike zone. Early in the game, I really felt strong -- maybe too 
strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Chicago shortstop Shawon Dunston, who hit two home runs: "There were 
times when Foster should have won. He's pitched good, so he really deserved 
today's win." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunston made sure Foster got off on the right track by hitting the first pitch 
of the game by Giant starter Salomon Torres into the left-field bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunston and Derrick May each had three of the Cubs' 14 hits. Mark Grace had 
two hits and drove in three runs. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 5, Houston 1 -- Tony Gwynn's disputed three-run homer off the center 
field wall highlighted a four-run fifth inning for the Padres at San Diego. 
Even Gwynn disputed it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my second inside-the-park home run," Gwynn said with a laugh. "I could 
see from where I was that it hit the orange line (on top of the wall)." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Sanders struck out a career-high 11 and Bip Roberts extended his hitting 
streak to 22 games, best in the National League since Pittsburgh's Jay Bell hit 
in 22 in a row in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Gwynn has hit safely in his last nine games, batting .432 (16 for 37). The 
four-time National League batting champion leads the league with a .385 
average. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 3, St. Louis 2 -- Zane Smith, saying the heat at St. Louis helps 
him, worked seven innings in temperatures that climbed to 101 degrees to 
continue his mastery of the Cardinals. He gave up one run on eight hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Since joining the Pirates in September 1990, Smith (7-6) is 5-2 with a 1.18 
ERA against the Cardinals, with four of the victories at Busch Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've pitched a lot of Sunday day games, I know that," Smith said. "This 
weather is really good for me because I think it tires me out, which makes my 
ball sink. That's when I have my best sinker." 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 13, Montreal 0 -- Pitcher Bobby Munoz had three hits and his 
first two major league RBIs as the Phillies completed a three-game sweep at 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Daulton hit his 14th homer, added an RBI double and scored three times 
as the Phillies roughed up Jeff Fassero (5-5), who came within one out of a 
no-hitter in his last outing. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 6, Florida 1 -- Dwight Gooden gave up three hits over eight innings 
at Miami for his first victory since April 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden (3-3), sidelined because of ligament damage in his right big toe, 
struck out six and walked one.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; TIGERS TIE '41 YANKEES' HOME RUN RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Detroit Tigers tied a 53-year-old major league record by homering for the 
25th consecutive game in a 3-1 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays on Sunday at 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe after the season is over, we will look at this record as an 
accomplishment, but I didn't even know it existed until four or five days ago," 
said Mickey Tettleton, who tied the record with a shot into the upper deck in 
right leading off the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit has hit 102 home runs, the most in the majors. The 1941 New York 
Yankees, whose record they matched, hit 151. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Gohr (2-0) got the victory, pitching into the eighth inning in the second 
start of his career. The Tigers scored single runs in the first three innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto, meanwhile, finished 1-5 on its six-game trip. After nine consecutive 
years of winning records on the road, the Blue Jays are 9-23 this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 6, Boston 5 -- Jack Morris earned his 250th victory as the Indians 
won their ninth in a row overall and 18th in a row at Cleveland's Jacobs Field. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the best home streak in baseball since Boston set a major league record 
by winning 24 in a row at Fenway Park in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "To win 18 in a row anyplace is very significant," Morris said. "All of us are 
aware of that. Nobody wants to do bad right now. That's what happens when you 
win." 
</P>
<P>
 Morris (6-4) improved to 5-0 over his last eight starts since he shaved his 
mustache to change his luck. He gave up 11 hits in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians improved to 40-25, best in the American League. They have come 
from behind to win 17 times this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston lost for the 11th consecutive time, its worst skid since 1932. The Red 
Sox are two games under .500 only one month after they were 13 games over. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 12, Seattle 9 -- Quinn Mack, rookie center fielder for the 
Mariners, let Greg Gagne's liner glance off his glove in the seventh inning, a 
play that was ruled a three-run, inside-the-park homer and gave the Royals a 
victory at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Griffey Jr. was the designated hitter in this game instead of the center 
fielder, but Manager Lou Piniella planned to put Griffey in center for the 
eighth and ninth innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had him warming up in the bullpen," Piniella said. "I wanted to get Mack 
one more at-bat. We were going to lose our DH." 
</P>
<P>
 Mack, in his fourth game since being called up from triple-A Calgary, started 
in on the ball, then turned the wrong way and fell as the ball hit his glove 
and rolled to the wall in center. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball should have been caught," Piniella said. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 10, Baltimore 4 -- Pat Meares had gone 498 at-bats without a home 
run before connecting for the first two of his career to lead the Twins at 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't ever swing for home runs," Meares said. "I just happened to get a 
couple of balls to hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Meares' two-run homer highlighted a six-run third inning that gave Pat Mahomes 
(7-2) his sixth victory in 11 starts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eighth, Meares hit a solo homer against reliever Mark Williamson for a 
7-4 lead. Kent Hrbek followed with his fourth homer of the season in the ninth, 
against Tom Bolton. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 5, Texas 0 -- Steve Ontiveros (3-2) pitched six shutout innings before 
leaving because of tightness in his right groin and Ruben Sierra homered as the 
Athletics completed a four-game sweep at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Taylor and Dave Leiper finished the four-hit shutout for the A's, who 
have won a season-high six in a row and seven of eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 10, New York 7 -- In humid, 96-degree weather at New York, the 
Brewers collected 17 hits. Greg Vaughn homered twice, Matt Mieske hit a two-run 
homer and Kevin Seitzer drove in three runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jody Reed reached base six times with three walks, two singles and a double. 
He is now seven for his last 13 and is batting .378 when leading off.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; UNFINISHED SYMPH HITS RIGHT NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anybody who thought Unfinished Symph's 16-1 upset in the Will Rogers Handicap 
last month was a fluke was surprised again Sunday at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing to outperform his pedigree, which indicates he should be merely a 
sprinter, the Aloha Prospector colt took command in the final quarter of a mile 
under under Gary Baze and went on to a two-length victory over a troubled 
Vaudeville in the $108,100 Cinema Handicap for 3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Nancy Rice, Wesley Ward and Terry Hatcher and trained by former 
jockey Wesley Ward, Unfinished Symph has now won four of eight starts. He 
completed the 1 1/8 miles on turf in a stakes-record 1:46 2/5 and paid $9.40 as 
the 7-2 third choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Unbeaten in two races entering the Cinema, Vaudeville lacked room inside 
entering the stretch, then finished well once he was able to get clear to beat 
3-2 favorite Fumo Di Londra by two lengths. Timbalier was a nose behind Fumo Di 
Londra in fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a pretty clean trip," said Baze, the third-leading rider at Yakima 
Meadows who has come south for two stakes victories on Unfinished Symph. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worried about (Fumo Di Londra) turning for home, so I kind of wanted to 
keep him within my view. When I got even with him turning for home, I asked my 
colt and he went on with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gary Stevens, who rode Vaudeville: "We had a nightmare trip. Anybody who 
watched it, well, it speaks for itself. He was hemmed in the whole way and 
never got loose." 
</P>
<P>
 Fumo Di Londra, who had beaten Unfinished Symph by three lengths in the 
Spotlight Breeders' Cup Handicap on May 21, set the pace under Alex Solis, but 
offered no resistance when challenged.

 Rusty Wallace won the Miller Genuine Draft 400 at the Michigan International 
Speedway in Brooklyn, Mich., Sunday to give car owner Roger Penske his eighth 
consecutive victory -- three in Winston Cup and five on the Indy car circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also Penske's first victory at the Michigan track, which he has owned 
since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace had to overcome a near-disastrous pit stop on Lap 176 during the 
seventh caution period of the race. Wallace took an extra lap, the yellow flag 
came out, he ran out of gas as he entered the pits and the engine died. As the 
Penske South Racing crew changed tires and filled the gas tank, crew chief 
Buddy Parrott sprayed ether into the engine compartment as Wallace tried to get 
the engine restarted. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the crew pushed him about 10 yards, with Parrott taking a tumble 
on pit road, the engine fired and Wallace moved back onto the two-mile, 
high-banked oval 11th among the 12 cars on the lead lap with 19 laps to go.

GOLF ROUNDUP; KIGGENS' FIRST VICTORY DENIES KING 
</P>

<P>
 Lisa Kiggens made a 12-foot birdie putt on the final hole Sunday at Rochester, 
N.Y., to win the LPGA Rochester International for her first tour victory, 
postponing Betsy King's entry into the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiggens, at 21 the second-youngest player on the tour, fired a career-best 
six-under 66 for a 15-under 273 total, one ahead of Dawn Coe-Jones, who shot 
67, and two in front of King, who had a 69. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never looked at the (leader) board all day," Kiggens said. "I didn't know 
where I stood. I didn't know I really had to make that putt on the last hole, 
and I think it helped me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured if I didn't look at the board . . . I wouldn't put any added 
pressure on myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Kiggens had missed the cut in five of 12 tournaments this year. Her previous 
best finish in three years on tour was second place in the Oldsmobile Classic 
at East Lansing, Mich., two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Her first-place finish at the Locust Hill Country Club was worth $75,000 and 
pushed her career earnings to $217,148. 
</P>
<P>
 King, who was atop the leader board after each of the first three rounds, 
missed a short putt for birdie on the par-five 17th. She is one victory short 
of the 30 tournament victories that would gain her automatic entry into the 
Hall of Fame.

 Lee Trevino won the BellSouth Senior Classic by a stroke when runner-up Dave 
Stockton bogeyed the final hole at Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 But Trevino's one-shot lead and a six-figure payday appeared doomed earlier as 
a shot at No. 11 headed for the water. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball hit the water, all right, but it didn't sink. It skipped -- twice -- 
and ended up on a bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Given a reprieve, Trevino dropped a par putt -- from 40 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "When something like that happens," Trevino said, "you feel like it's your 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I did that, I felt like it was my tournament. Not only do you have to 
hit the shots, but you have to have some luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Trevino, who closed with a five-under 67, completed 54 holes at 199 for his 
sixth tournament victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockton, who shot a 69 and finished at 200, couldn't believe what happened at 
No. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him if he thought God was a Mexican," Stockton said.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was getting pretty good luck before that, but that sealed it."

WASHINGTON INSIGHT

<TEXT>

 PARTY POWER: To understand how much California matters to the politically 
precarious Clinton White House, look no further than the Washington premiere of 
"The Lion King," Disney's latest animated feature. Although it was held on a 
sweltering summer night, Administration officials and prominent Democratic 
politicians turned out by the score. Vice President Al Gore was there, posing 
for photographers with Disney chief Michael Eisner. Deputy Secretary of State 
Strobe Talbot broke away from the Korea crisis to attend, along with Laura 
D'Andrea Tyson, head of the Council of Economic Advisers. But what drew the 
glittering crowd was not just the made-for-Disney fairy tale. For Disney, the 
spectacle was a way of demonstrating its own clout on the eve of congressional 
hearings on its controversial plan to build a theme park outside Washington. 
And no one in the Administration ever forgets that California's 54 electoral 
votes are critical for the President's future, while Hollywood remains the 
mother lode for politicians seeking campaign funds. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 MAD FOR MADELEINE: When the White House needs a foreign policy spokesperson, 
it often turns to U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright. After all, the other 
choices -- Secretary of State Warren Christopher and National Security Chief 
Anthony Lake -- are seen as lackluster speakers, while Albright is considered a 
whiz at the art of "doing television." . . . On her primary playing field at 
U.N. headquarters, however, her stature is less sure. She has annoyed some 
Security Council ambassadors for moving too slowly, they say, on Rwanda. And 
critics compare her unfavorably to a predecessor, Thomas Pickering, who was 
seen as a decisive force during the Persian Gulf War. . . . Now, however, 
Albright has a real chance to quiet her U.N. critics: She will be responsible 
for guiding an American-sponsored resolution on sanctions against North Korea 
through the Security Council. Winning approval will require as much diplomacy 
and tenacity as anything Pickering faced.

 MYSTERY CAMPAIGN: They have been rolling into congressional offices for weeks 
now, hundreds of pre-printed postcards emblazoned with stars and stripes 
seeking information on lawmakers' upcoming public forums. Each says the sender 
may want to attend -- suggesting that some interest group may be planning to 
pack the events with members. What makes the mailings unusual -- and the reason 
they have piqued the curiosity of congressional staffers -- is that the cards 
do not mention a specific issue or cause. But a survey of Capitol Hill offices 
indicates a pattern: Many include handwritten notes from individuals 
identifying themselves as members of the National Rifle Assn. or as opponents 
of a proposed assault weapon ban now before Congress. As to whether the NRA is 
orchestrating the stealth campaign, the pro-gun group won't say.

 VACATION DILEMMA: President Clinton, his wife, Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea, 
were so enthralled by Martha's Vineyard last summer that they are eager to 
vacation there again in August. But where to stay? As the first First Family 
since the Trumans without their own vacation home, the Clintons have had to 
depend on friends' generosity for their summer sojourns. Last year, they 
borrowed the Vineyard home of former Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara. But 
this time, White House sources are murmuring, the Clintons may have set their 
sights on the Vineyard estate of the late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.

TERENCE DE VERE WHITE; IRISH NOVELIST, CRITIC AND EDITOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Terence de Vere White, an Irish novelist and critic, has died of Parkinson's 
disease. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
 White died Friday at his London home, according to a death notice published in 
Saturday's Daily Telegraph. 
</P>
<P>
 White attended Trinity College in his native Dublin and planned to become a 
lawyer, like his father. But he left the law in 1961 to become the literary 
editor of the Irish Times. 
</P>
<P>
 He went on to write 26 books -- the last of them, the novel "Chat Show," seven 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lucifer Falling" in 1967 was the first of his books to be published in the 
United States as well as in Great Britain. Reviewing the novel, The Times' 
critic noted that White "fascinatingly treads the shoals and devious paths of 
the Dublin university he creates with surety, nimble wit, biting humor, 
sardonic description, and, oftentimes, compassion." 
</P>
<P>
 White was made a member of the Irish Academy of Letters in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, White left Dublin and moved to London to be near the biographer and 
novelist Victoria Glendinning, whom he married in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 The author is survived by his wife and by three children from his first 
marriage.

YEKUTIEL HALBERSTAM; LEADER OF KLAUSENBURGER HASIDIC SECT 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rabbi Yekutiel Halberstam, leader of the Klausenburger Hasidic sect, has died 
at age 90, a follower said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Halberstam, born to a rabbinical dynasty in Cluj in present-day Romania -- 
known as Klausenburg at the time -- led a Hasidic sect with thousands of 
followers in Israel and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 He was in the international limelight two years ago when Romanian construction 
workers unearthed a box of silver religious objects that Halberstam had buried 
for safety during World War II. The treasure was restored to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Halberstam lost a wife and 11 children during the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, he immigrated to Brooklyn, where he began to re-establish the 
Klausenburger sect. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1962, he emigrated to Israel with his followers, where he established 
Kiryat Zanz, one of the first all-Hasidic communities to be built in Israel. He 
died Friday night in that settlement near the coastal town of Netanya. 
</P>
<P>
 Halberstam started a new family there and established Netanya's Laniado 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his second wife, two sons and five daughters. One of his 
sons, Rabbi Zvi Elimelekh Halberstam, is the rabbi of Kiryat Zanz and is 
expected to be named his successor. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, another prominent Hasidic rabbi, Menachem Schneerson, died in the 
United States at the age of 92. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasidism, founded in Poland 300 years ago, combines strict adherence to Jewish 
law with a joyful belief in mysticism and the eternal soul.

STREET SMART: CALTRANS SEES THE WARNING SIGNS OF FREEWAY TURNOFF PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Now we're leaving Huntington Beach and tooling along north on the San Gabriel 
River (605) Freeway. We make note to watch for signs directing us to the new 
Glenn M. Anderson (105) Freeway turnoff. 
</P>
<P>
 We're not worried about the Glenn M. Anderson Freeway coming up unannounced. 
Look at all the good signage announcing the Riverside (91) Freeway at three 
miles, two miles and one and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 And the signs warning us of the Imperial Highway ahead at 2 1/4 miles, 1 1/2 
miles, 1 mile and 1/4 mile. Whoa! What was that going by on the right? A sign 
for Glenn M. Anderson Freeway west? And the turnoff ramp directly under it? 
</P>
<P>
 Shall we go for it by crossing two lanes of traffic and two solid white lines? 
Yeah, right, plenty of turnoff announcement -- at least one-eighth of a mile! 
</P>
<P>
 Come on, guys, we build a great freeway, and then from the San Gabriel River 
Freeway we hide it and make it unsafe to access. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Noll Costa Mesa Caltrans is in the process of installing additional 
advance warning signs on the new Glenn M. Anderson Freeway from the Long Beach 
(710) Freeway, the Harbor (110) Freeway and the San Gabriel River Freeway. All 
of the new advance signs will be in place by September, said Caltrans 
spokeswoman Pat Reid. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I had an occasion to use the Glenn M. Anderson Freeway for the first time 
recently and could not believe the insanity of metering lights on the 
transitions between this and the other freeways. To my knowledge, no other 
interchange has these lights. 
</P>
<P>
 I would greatly appreciate it if you would please check with Caltrans and 
determine the reason for these impediments to the smooth flow of traffic. Is 
it, as I suspect, another effort to force drivers into the car-pool lanes since 
apparently the car-pool lanes do not have these lights? If this is the case, 
will the other interchanges have lights installed when car-pool lanes are 
added? 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford L. Bundy Costa Mesa Pat Reid said the timing on the connector meters 
on the Glenn M. Anderson Freeway is still a work in progress. Caltrans 
engineers are continually changing the operating times at different locations 
to see what works best, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The theory of ramp metering is to allow only so many vehicles on the freeway 
so they can travel at least at 45 m.p.h. or above, Reid said. Meters at 
connectors are independent of car-pool lanes, she said. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; PRUDENT DELAY, WHILE TREES STILL STAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the San Joaquin Hills tollway were being proposed for the first time today, 
there would be serious questions about whether it should be allowed to cut 
through pristine coastal canyons in the beloved environs of Laguna Beach and 
about whether such a project were needed at all.  
</P>
<P>
 But the fact is, the corridor has been in the works for a very long time, and 
it has worked its way tortuously through various stages of review and approval, 
all in the face of serious and sustained opposition from environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the issues largely have been resolved, a few legal wrinkles still are 
to be worked out, even as much antagonism and bitterness about the project 
remain.  
</P>
<P>
 Now it has come to this in the disputed 4.6 miles of the tollway that cut 
through the Laguna Greenbelt between Newport Coast Drive and El Toro Road: The 
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeal has issued a temporary injunction to stop 
clearing while it considers an attempt by environmentalists to halt work until 
a U.S. district court judge's ruling can be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, the tollway planners appear headed for a resolution in their 
favor before much longer. But let the courts sort things out before the 
bulldozers roll on and knock down the trees and coastal sage and with them 
whatever hope may remain of somehow constructing a modest accommodation between 
road proponents and opponents for the long term.

ROCKETS, SMITH KEEP KNICKS AT BAY, 86-84; NBA FINALS: GUARD'S THREE-POINT SHOT 
WITH 3:19 LEFT HELPS STALL NEW YORK COMEBACK, SETTING UP GAME 7. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Kenny Smith's horrible series turned terrific with one flick of the wrist that 
sent a 3-pointer through the hoop and helped the Houston Rockets stay alive in 
the NBA finals. 
</P>
<P>
 His shot with 3:19 left and New York fighting back sparked the Rockets to an 
86-84 win Sunday night that tied the series 3-3 with Game 7 Wednesday night in 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, the starting point guard who had just 25 points in the series to that 
point, launched his shot from the top of the key. It gave Houston an 84-77 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 He was mobbed by his teammates when he returned to the bench as the Knicks 
called a timeout. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Knicks were far from done as John Starks, who had 16 points in the 
fourth quarter, hit a basket with 1:33 left and a 3-pointer 20 seconds later to 
make it 84-82. Houston didn't score on its next possession, but Hakeem Olajuwon 
stole a pass by Starks, was fouled and made two free throws with 39 seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Mason's 12-footer with 32 seconds left brought New York back within 
two and a long jumper by Smith as the shot clock wound down went in and out. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks had the ball and a final chance with 7.6 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Starks' 3-pointer at the buzzer fell way short and was knocked out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon had 30 points and 10 rebounds for Houston, while Carl Herrera had 12 
points and Smith seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Starks finished with 27 points and Patrick Ewing had 17 points and 15 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Houston has the homecourt advantage that New York seized by winning the 
previous two games. 
</P>
<P>
 Home teams have won the last 19 Game 7s. The Rockets, who began the season 
with 15 straight wins, will be NBA champions if they can end it with two in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night's Game 7 will be the first in an NBA Finals in six years and 
only the third in the last 16. The last time it happened, the Los Angeles 
Lakers overcame a 3-2 deficit by winning two straight at home against Detroit 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Home teams are 57-11 in all Game 7s played in NBA history. But four of the 
last five championships were clinched on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston is 2-1 in seventh games, including a comeback from a 2-0 deficit to 
Phoenix in this year's Western Conference semifinals. The Knicks won two 
seventh games this year against Chicago and Indiana and are 6-5 overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing 27-26 with 9 1/2 minutes left in the second quarter, the Rockets took 
control with a 9-0 run and led 46-36 at halftime on 53 percent shooting. The 
Knicks hit only 34 percent of their shots and were outrebounded 24-16. 
</P>
<P>
 New York missed its first five shots before taking a 15-6 lead on Charles 
Oakley's jumper with 4:47 left in the first period. Houston scored eight of the 
last 10 points of the quarter, six on two 3-pointers by Robert Horry, to tie 
the game at 21. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets started the second period with a 3-pointer by Sam Cassell and a 
jump hook by Herrera, who had 10 points in the half. That put Houston on top 
26-21, but the Knicks went ahead with the next six points, five by Charles 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Then New York went nearly five minutes without a basket as Houston began its 
nine-point spurt with a dunk by Herrera, who hit all five of his shots in the 
half. It ended with a dunk by Olajuwon, who led all scorers in the first half 
with 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets built their biggest lead of the half, 43-32 with 2:49 remaining, 
on Herrera's 14-footer and Olajuwon's two foul shots. Vernon Maxwell gave 
Houston its 10-point halftime lead with a 3-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston took its biggest lead of the game, 58-46 with five minutes left in the 
third quarter. But New York outscored the Rockets 16-7 after that to cut it to 
65-62 with one period to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Derek Harper started the rally with a 3-pointer and Mason, who had missed his 
other four shots, hit a second-chance jumper at the buzzer to end it.

SWEDEN GETS TIE WITH CAMEROON; GROUP B: SWEDEN'S DAHLIN SCORES IN 75TH MINUTE 
FOR 2-2 DRAW BEFORE 83,959 IN THE ROSE BOWL. 
</P>

 Cameroon's Indomitable Lions, the darlings of the World Cup four years ago, 
began the 1994 tournament not quite as successfully, tying Sweden, 2-2, Sunday 
at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Francois Omam-Biyick, who scored Cameroon's goal in a 1-0 upset of Argentina 
in the 1990 World Cup opener, broke a 1-1 tie in the first minute of the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 But Martin Dahlin lifted Sweden into the tie in the 75th minute when he kicked 
in a rebound of a hard shot by Henrik Larsson. Larsson's shot was deflected by 
goalie Joseph-Antoine Bell into the crossbar and bounced back to Dahlin, who 
chested it down and, standing all alone eight yards in front of the net, put it 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedes, who lost three first-round games in Rome by identical 2-1 scores, 
got their first goal on a header by Roger Ljung seven minutes into the match, 
played before a crowd of 83,959 in the Rose Bowl -- 8,000 below capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 A long pass by Rigobert Son Bahanag set up Omam-Biyick's goal. With the ball 
sailing upfield, Omam-Biyick broke behind two defenders and tapped the ball 
just under the left arm of goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli, who had come out to 
challenge him. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Vivien Foe assisted on David Embe's goal for Cameroon, which in 1990 
became the first African team to make the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Foe charged Swedish defender Patrik Andersson as Andersson kicked the ball, 
attempting to clear it from the Swedes' zone. Foe blocked the kick, picked up 
the loose ball as it bounced behind Andersson, dribbled in and then laid a soft 
crossing pass in front of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Embe, just in front of defender Joachim Bjorklund, tapped the ball into the 
empty net. Although the Swedes protested Embe was offside, the referee ruled 
the goal valid. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden scored seven minutes into the game on Ljung's header off a direct kick 
by Jonas Thern. Thern's kick from the left of the goal, about 20 yards out, 
sailed toward the far post and Ljung was in perfect position.

ANALYSIS; HALL OF FAME NO CINCH FOR SANDBERG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK O'CONNELL, THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ryne Sandberg's stunning announcement Monday that he was retiring at the age 
of 34 and in his 14th major league season begs the question: How does his early 
bowing out affect his chance to make the Hall of Fame? 
</P>
<P>
 Five years from now, when Sandberg's name will go on the Baseball Writers' 
Association of America ballot, the reasons for his exit will have little 
bearing on the electorate. That Sandberg no longer thought he was capable of 
maintaining the high standards he set for himself or that he refused to be the 
Tony Gwynn of the Chicago Cubs -- an exemplary veteran figure on a franchise in 
ruins -- won't enter into the equation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a lot of clubs who would like to have him on their roster right now," 
said St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Rick Sutcliffe, a former teammate. "Sometimes 
baseball tells you when you've had enough. This time, he told baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 The five-year waiting period before a player with 10 or more major league 
seasons is placed on the ballot helps distance emotion from the process of 
determing Hall of Fame credentials. In the end, it will come down to numbers, 
which Sandberg's retirement has petrified. Will they be sufficient for him to 
gain entry? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what credentials are needed," Colorado Rockies third base coach 
Don Zimmer, who was around Sandberg as a coach and manager of the Cubs in 
1984-91, told the Newark Star-Ledger's Dan Castellano. "In another three or 
four years, he would have been a cinch. Now, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's this view from Hall of Famer Joe Morgan, now an ESPN analyst. 
"He's a great player, but not a cinch for the Hall of Fame," Morgan told BBWAA 
executive secretary Jack Lang. "He was kind of quiet, and his teams never won 
anything. He never showed me that kind of leadership. When things are going 
bad, you don't just walk away, do you?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Sounds to me like Joe doesn't want another second baseman in the Hall," said 
Mets special assistant Ed Lynch, a former teammate and opponent of Sandberg. 
"Why should Ryno be penalized because he didn't play with Johnny Bench, Pete 
Rose, Tony Perez and Dave Concepcion?" 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, few Cubs can boast what Sandberg can -- two shots at postseason play 
-- although boasting never has been part of his nature. Sandberg didn't get to 
the World Series as the Cubs were ousted in the National League Championship 
Series of 1984 and '89, but he hit .385 with one home run and six RBI in 10 
playoff games, so his postseason credentials are solid. 
</P>
<P>
 By cutting his career short, Sandberg has wounded his resume. For example, of 
his 245 home runs, 240 have come as a second baseman. Had he played out the 
remainder of his contract -- the rest of this season and two more -- he likely 
would have broken Morgan's record for home runs by a second baseman (266). 
Sandberg, with 905 RBI, would surely have surpassed 1,000 and added to his 10 
All-Star Game appearances and nine Gold Gloves, the most at his position. 
</P>
<P>
 A short career may not necessarily affect a player's candidacy for the Hall of 
Fame. Among players elected by the BBWAA, eight played fewer seasons than 
Sandberg -- Joe DiMaggio, Hank Greenberg and Mickey Cochrane (13 each), Dizzy 
Dean and Sandy Koufax (12 each), Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella and Ralph 
Kiner (10 each). Factors in those shortened careers include health (Cochrane, 
Dean, Koufax, Kiner, Campanella), war (DiMaggio, Greenberg) and civics 
(Robinson, the majors' first black player, was a rookie at 28). 
</P>
<P>
 In cases of those who lost significant time in their careers because of 
military service in World War II, the Veterans Committee elected who the BBWAA 
overlooked: Johnny Mize, Enos Slaughter, Bobby Doerr, Pee Wee Reese, Billy 
Herman and Phil Rizzuto. But the Veterans Committee has continued to dismiss 
Joe Gordon, whose career was reduced to 11 seasons yet featured an MVP season 
(1942), five World Series championships (1938-39-41-43 with the Yankees, '48 
with the Indians) and 253 home runs, of which 246 were as a second baseman, the 
American League record for the position as is his single-season total of 32 in 
'48. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Sandberg be the Joe Gordon of his generation? 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a Hall of Famer for me," Zimmer said. "He never missed infield or went 
into a game unprepared. When he made an error, it was like the sky was falling. 
He was the best second baseman I've ever been around." 
</P>
<P>
 That's quite a testament from a man who has worked in Major League Baseball 
for 40 years and played alongside Robinson. No Hall of Fame second baseman can 
match the career .990 fielding percentage of Sandberg, but if defense was that 
great a factor, then Bill Mazeroski, Nellie Fox and Bobby Grich would have 
plaques in Cooperstown, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 No more accurrate assessment of Sandberg's career can be presented than that 
of Jim Frey, whose hiring to manage the Cubs in 1984 proved a enormous 
influence on Sandberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember one day in batting practice I was hitting fungoes near the cage 
and Jimmy was talking to Ryno," Zimmer said. "I heard Jimmy say, 'Ryno, I'm not 
going to tell you to be a slugger, but I know what will help Jim Frey win 
ballgames for the Chicago Cubs. When the count is 2-and-0 or 3-and-1, look for 
the fastball inside and turn on it.' Ryno nodded, and Jimmy just walked away." 
</P>
<P>
 After totaling 15 home runs in three seasons and 1,274 at-bats, Sandberg had 
19 home runs in 636 at-bats in his MVP season of 1984 and would have five 
25-plus homer seasons, including a career-high 40 in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "No doubt that after Morgan retired, Sandberg was the best second baseman in 
the National League," said Frey, now retired and living in Virginia. "He was 
the best player possible for a manager. He was not a self-promoter. He's a very 
private guy. I've been around a lot of great players who were (censored). 
Sandberg was different. He was a great player who is one of the greatest guys I 
ever met. I fought with ownership to get him that contract. I told them the 
money would have no adverse affect on him. He set high standards for himself. 
As a manager, you pray to have a player like that." 
</P>
<P>
 As a voter, you pray to reward such a player.

U.S. OPEN; TRIO STAGGERS INTO A PLAYOFF; GOLF: ROBERTS, ELS AND MONTGOMERIE ALL 
SQUANDER CHANCES, ARE TIED AFTER 72 HOLES. ELS BENEFITS FROM OFFICIAL'S 
MISTAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Is this the U.S. Open that nobody wants? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, time has run out, and somebody, either Loren Roberts, Ernie Els or Colin 
Montgomerie, is going to win his first major golf title at Oakmont Country Club 
an extra day after the 94th U.S. Open championship stumbled into a rare 
three-way playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio is also together on one more thing. They all know it already should 
have been over. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Roberts, who followed his 64 on Saturday with a 70, could have won if he 
had made a 4 1/2-foot putt for par on the 18th hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can kick myself," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Els, who shot a 73, could have won if he had known what the score was, 
played it safe and kept his drive at the 18th hole on the fairway instead of 
underneath some trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just tried to smash the living stuffings out of it," Els said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Montgomerie, who shot a 70, could have won if he had not bogeyed Nos. 11, 
12, 13 and 15 coming in. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to accept there are going to be more mistakes than birdies at that 
stage," Montgomerie said. 
</P>
<P>
 So there you have it. After 72 holes, Roberts, Els and Montgomerie are at 279, 
five under par. The last time there was a three-way playoff at the U.S. Open 
was in 1963, when Julius Boros defeated Jacky Cupit and Arnold Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
 At least this playoff has got some history going for it. What happened in the 
last round Sunday also will go down in history, certainly not for its 
brilliance, though. 
</P>
<P>
 From the very first hole, there were enough mistakes and bad shots to fill the 
nearby Allegheny River. Els got the error derby off to a roaring start on the 
first hole when he hit his drive far left and was erroneously awarded a drop by 
a USGA rules official. 
</P>
<P>
 A forklift camera position for ABC-TV was in Els' path to the hole. According 
to USGA rules, a drop is awarded only if the obstruction cannot be moved. 
</P>
<P>
 Trey Holland of the USGA ruled Els was entitled to a drop because the forklift 
could not be moved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a mistake," Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Els wound up with a bogey at No. 1, but he might have made double bogey or 
worse, which would have altered the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Els also was a awarded a drop, this one correctly, when he hit his drive on 
No. 17 under a grandstand at the green. Allowed to advance the ball about 10 
yards from his lie, Els parred the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, it was clear that the U.S. Open would be a three-man race. One by 
one, the other contenders dropped out, most notably Hale Irwin, whose plummet 
was dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Irwin shot 78, falling from a tie for third into a tie for 18th, eight shots 
behind the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Irwin: "It was just a disaster day." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Strange, Tom Watson and Frank Nobilo fell out of contention on the back 
nine. Strange shot his fourth consecutive round of 70 and finished fourth, but 
he could have made a noise if he had been able to avoid consecutive bogeys at 
Nos. 15 and 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson began the day tied with Roberts and Montgomerie but shot 74 and 
finished in a tie for sixth. Nobilo shot 39 on the back nine, 76 for the day 
and finished in a tie for ninth.  
</P>
<P>
 John Cook's 71 earned him fifth place at 282, two behind Strange. Clark Dennis 
and Greg Norman tied for sixth with Watson at 283. 
</P>
<P>
 With no one making a run at the leaders, the Open looked as if it would be 
lost by the player making the most mistakes between Els, Roberts and 
Montgomerie. 
</P>
<P>
 This category also was a tie. Roberts, 38, from Memphis, found himself even 
with Els when the 24-year-old South African bogeyed No. 11. Roberts took the 
lead by himself when he birdied No. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts was still even with Els when his second shot on No. 18, an eight-iron, 
hit a downward slope on the green and rolled into the fringe. He chipped to 4 
1/2 feet, left with a putt he needed to make for par. 
</P>
<P>
 He missed. The bogey put him one shot back of Els, who had finished No. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a terrible putt," Roberts said. "I'm not going to lie to you. I had 
trouble getting the putter back. But I have had that same situation before, 
been able to make them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite honestly, after 76 the first round, I wouldn't have given a shot at 
being where I am today and I am not going to look back and say, 'What if?' 
because I could have very easily been down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomerie, 30, should have been on a plane back to Scotland after his bogey 
explosion on the back nine, but he calmed himself and birdied No. 17 to get 
within one shot of the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 He hit a three-iron off the tee, a sand wedge to 12 feet and sank the putt. 
Montgomerie didn't know how big that birdie would be. 
</P>
<P>
 It probably would have been minor if Els had opened his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Els did not check the leader board before he got to the 18th tee. He did not 
see that Roberts had bogeyed the hole. He did not see that he had a one-shot 
lead. He did not realize that a par on the last hole would win. 
</P>
<P>
 What he did do was pull out his driver, ignore a more accurate iron and blast 
the ball far left, nearly to the 15th green, which is located adjacent to the 
fairway. 
</P>
<P>
 Els had made his final mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never looked at the scoreboard," he said. "If I (had), I think I would have 
gone with a two-iron or a three-wood, (but) I thought I had to make a birdie 
and I wanted to hit it as far as I could." 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Els looked at the scoreboard and decided to play it safe. He 
chipped out onto the fairway, but the ball landed in a divot. 
</P>
<P>
 His third shot, a sand wedge, was to the front of the green and he two-putted 
from 40 feet for bogey, the second putt from four feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I was fortunate to make five," Els said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Els, Montgomerie nor Roberts played the back nine under par. 
Montgomerie said his good fortune is equally great and so is his outlook, 
mainly because of Els and Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I am sort of one up, really, because they both have had a chance to 
win and haven't managed to take it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to accept that neither of us has won a major championship before and 
the pressures are very different from a normal tournament. We have all won 
tournaments, but this is very different." 
</P>
<P>
 There is little playoff experience among the trio. Els is 0-1 and Montgomerie 
0-2 in sudden-death playoffs. Roberts has never been in any kind of playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they are in the 31st playoff in U.S. Open history, one that might have 
been avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts said what happened Sunday kind of goes with the Open territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I think somebody said that Opens aren't usually won, (you) usually back 
into them," he said. "It is just another classic Open. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean I feel as bad as anyone because I backed it up today myself coming in, 
but at least I got a chance again tomorrow." U.S. Open Playoff Results

 Preparing for their World Cup opener in Dallas on Tuesday, the Buglarians and 
Nigerians have been less than gracious to those Texans trying to join the 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria, which arrived in Dallas last Wednesday, has closed its practices to 
the public and media.A TV photographer was physically removed from a practice 
in Austin, Tex., and campus police at Southern Methodist University in Dallas 
circled the fence at Morrison Bell Stadium. They told fans to go home and made 
sure no one took pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 What the Bulgarians thought the Texans would do with photographs of their 
practice was not known. 
</P>
<P>
 Some fans had waited in 90-degree heat to get a glimpse of the team, so there 
were few soccer converts after the experience. Some said, "Forget Bulgaria," 
and "Go Nigeria." 
</P>
<P>
 Until. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It was discovered that the Nigerians were equally paranoid. They, too, have 
closed practices and refused media interview requests. They even tried some 
cloak-and-dagger tactics, telling reporters they were taking Sunday off, then 
holding a practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria made a comeback of sorts on Sunday, opening its evening practice to 
the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Emil Verbovski, Bulgaria team liaison, defended the position of keeping most 
practices closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Americans don't have to understand," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was suggested that even Super Bowl players practice in front of well 
wishers and give daily interviews, he said: 
</P>
<P>
 "American football players talk more than they play." ELLIOTT ALMOND

GIANTS GET STRAWBERRY TO BOOST POOR OFFENSE; BASEBALL: THEY HOPE TO HAVE 
TROUBLED FORMER DODGER IN RIGHT FIELD TO REPLACE MCGEE BY MID-JULY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry needed a place to play and the San Francisco Giants needed a 
right fielder. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, they made a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry signed with the Giants, six weeks after his release from a drug 
treatment center and four weeks after being waived by the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a risk when you get up in the morning. Life is a risk," said Bob 
Quinn, Giant general manager. "We're willing to take whatever risk is involved 
because we're convinced that this man is ready to turn his life around and play 
good solid baseball for the Giants." 
</P>
<P>
 The struggling Giants hope to have Strawberry in right field by the All-Star 
break to replace Willie McGee, sidelined for the season because of a ruptured 
Achilles' tendon. They hope Strawberry can regain his form and revive the 
team's slumping offense, ranked among the worst in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry, 32, was signed for the rest of the season, Quinn said. Financial 
terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 The troubled outfielder, who was released by the Dodgers on May 25, did not 
attend the news conference. He won't be available for comment until later this 
month, Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released by the club, Strawberry said: "My agent, Eric 
Goldschmidt and I were extremely impressed with the manner in which the Giants 
organization reached out to me." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he had visited this past week with club owner Peter Magowan, Quinn, 
club executive Larry Baer, Manager Dusty Baker and coach Bobby Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry said "that being a member of the Giants presented a comfortable 
atmosphere for my return to the game." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've missed the competitiveness and can't wait until I can actively join the 
club and hopefully contribute to a pennant-winning season," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn said Strawberry will begin a conditioning program under team 
supervision, followed by a brief playing assignment with one of the Giants' 
minor league affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn said if all went well, Strawberry could be with the team by mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not surprised that he signed because there's no doubt that he wanted 
continue his career," said Fred Claire, Dodger general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the most important thing is that Darryl's had a lot of good 
counseling, so he needed to be ready in his own mind and in his own life to go 
out to play again. So, I can only assume that's the case. My hope would be that 
he would go on through this year without any incident, and that he would go on 
through the rest of his life without any incidents." 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants are a season-low nine games under .500. Expected to win the 
realigned and weakened NL West, San Francisco has fallen into third place, 5 
1/2 games behind the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the presence of Barry Bonds and Matt Williams, the Giants are last in 
the majors in batting average at .241. They are tied with San Diego for the 
fewest runs in the majors with 262. 
</P>
<P>
 "All things considered, this is a great place for Darryl," Giant reliever Rod 
Beck said. "We'll get a quality player to make a run. I don't see a downside. 
He's not going to find a better situation than here because of the people 
surrounding him." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker formerly played with Strawberry's older brother, Michael. The Giants 
also said that Michael Strawberry would live with his brother once he joins the 
team and also accompany him on the club's road trips. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody deserves a second chance. There are guys who will turn 
their lives around, so give Darryl Strawberry a chance to turn his life 
around," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry has not played since acknowledging he had a substance abuse problem 
on April 4, the day before the Dodgers opened the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry was supposed to be paid $3 million this season and $5 million in 
1995 under a five-year, $20.25-million contract signed with the Dodgers on Nov. 
8, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a contract settlement reached earlier this season, Strawberry will be 
paid $4,857,143 on July 1. That is the remainder the Dodgers owe him from his 
1994 salary and half of his 1995 salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Giants did not disclose how much they will pay Strawberry, it is 
possible they got him for the major league minimum. That total is $109,000 for 
an entire season -- but because the Giants signed him for less than a year, 
they might have gotten him for about $63,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry has a .259 lifetime batting average and hit at least 26 home runs 
every season from 1983-1991.

<TEXT>
<P>
 GROUP B 
</P>
<P>
 at Stanford Stadium, Palo Alto 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil vs. Russia 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ESPN, Univision 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: Brazil's Romario and Bebeto are not only the best forwards in 
the tournament, they are among the most appealing players to watch. Russia's 
striker, Sergei Yuran, hopes that is not what his defensive teammates are 
caught doing. "Romario and Bebeto will be our main problem," he said. "We have 
to mark them very closely if we want to have a good result. They are dynamite 
players." 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil's difficulty has been in setting them up because veteran playmaker Rai 
has not been as dependable since leading his club team, Sao Paulo, to its first 
world championship in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil also is without three starters on defense. Ricardo Gomes, the captain 
of Brazil's 1990 World Cup team, suffered a torn calf muscle during a recent 
friendly against El Salvador, Aldair has a knee injury and Mozer is not on the 
roster because of a liver ailment. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Brazil, Russia does not appear potent on offense because three 
of its best forwards -- Sergei Kiriakov, Igor Kolyvanov and Igor Shalimov -- 
refused to play for Coach Pavel Sadyrin. As if that did not cause the Russians 
enough problems, their captain, defender Viktor Onopko, has to sit today 
because of his ejection in the last qualifying game. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: Insisting its responsibilities as an academic institution came 
before the World Cup, Stanford erected a stage in the center of the field the 
weekend before last and held graduation ceremonies. The damaged grass has been 
replaced and, according to venue director Peter Bridgwater, given "tender, 
loving care." The coaches do not seem concerned, but strange bounces could lead 
to a strange result. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: Sadyrin said he has warned his players to look out not only for 
Bebeto and Romario but "11 Bebetos and Romarios." Even though Brazil is the 
World Cup favorite, it is not that good. But it is good enough to beat Russia, 
2-0. RANDY HARVEY

 GROUP F 
</P>
<P>
 at RFK Stadium, Washington 
</P>
<P>
 Netherlands vs. 
</P>
<P>
 Saudi Arabia 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: Univision, ESPN (9:30 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: Majed Mohammed, the legendary Saudi forward nicknamed "the 
Pele of the Desert," is sound enough to play after being sidelined because of a 
back injury. He even scored a goal in Saudi Arabia's final World Cup tuneup 
against Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is, Mohammed, 35, looks nearly as old as Pele. And he will be 
matched with one of the world's finest defenders, Ronald Koeman. 
</P>
<P>
 This is only one of the matchups that will favor the powerful Dutch, who will 
use this opening game as their first step toward possible World Cup stardom. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saudis' star midfielder, Ahmed Jameel Madani, will be marked by Frank 
Rijkaard and Jan Wouters, two European stars in the final years of their 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saudis' top defender, Muhammad Abdul Jawwad, will have to deal with Dutch 
forward Dennis Bergkamp, one of the finest playmakers in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: From their rowdy fans who are known for playing with policeman's 
caps to their outspoken stars, the Dutch already lead the World Cup in 
arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
 In their final pre-Cup news conference Saturday, Koeman ripped the United 
States for a lack of soccer interest, saying it was a "pity" that the World Cup 
was here. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Netherlands, it's a big feast, but here? No. Sometimes you have to 
explain the rules to people," he said. Forward Ronald De Boer then ripped 
baseball, saying, "We saw the Blue Jays. There were maybe five exciting moments 
in the whole game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Saudis, making their World Cup finals debut, are hoping the Dutch are 
lulled into mistakes like the Italians and Spaniards, both of whom were 
surprised in their opening game. Italy was stunned by Ireland, and Spain was 
tied in the final seconds by South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have all seen what happened with Ireland and South Korea in the tournament 
so far, and it has given this team hope," said Hamad Al Rashid, a Saudi TV 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: This same Dutch team whipped Hungary, 7-1, during World Cup 
qualifying. When facing a weaker team, it is not afraid to pour it on and rub 
it in. Tonight's beating will be so bad, local fans will think they are 
watching the Redskins. The Netherlands, by the equivalent of a touchdown. BILL

 Despite reports that all games at the Rose Bowl are sold out, there were 
hundreds of empty seats Sunday.Most were at the top of the stadium in four 
sections, but many were near midfield. 
</P>
<P>
 The official attendance was 83,959. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup officials said before the games that they wanted to avoid the large 
blocks of empty seats that were evident during the 1990 World Cup in Italy 
largely because they make a bad impression on television viewers. EMILIO

capacity, and tickets were selling for well below face value as time approached 
for Morocco's game against Belgium.

 The controversial security fences inside the Cotton Bowl that so incensed 
international soccer officials will stay for the remaining five games in 
Dallas. The fence was partially removed before the tournament began, but police 
say no further changes are anticipated.

 Roger Milla, 42, the star of Cameroon's improbable success in the 1990 Cup, 
did not play against Sweden, at least partly because of an injured hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is to be considered as one of 22 players on our squad," Cameroon Coach 
Henri Michel said. "He is always available. We consider him a joker, a wild 
card. There is a reason to hold him out of certain situations such as today. He 
has had an injury." EMILIO GARCIA-RUIZ

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; SPOTLIGHT; NO DANCING AROUND THEIR LOVE OF

<P>
 It's an international melting pot, that line outside the McDonald's chuck 
wagon at the Rose Bowl's World Cup food cart. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting patiently for their sack of Big Macs were Fernando Bujones and his 
wife Maria, two ballet instructors who are in Pasadena mixing business with 
their love of soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Bujones, 39, a guest artist with the Boston Ballet and a serious Brazil fan, 
is attempting to "squeeze in 15 to 20" World Cup matches between tour stops 
during the next month. 
</P>
<P>
 After catching Romania-Colombia and Sweden-Cameroon at the Rose Bowl, he flies 
to Palo Alto today for Brazil's Group B opener against Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say it will be 2-0, Brazil," Bujones boldly predicted. "I like their 
chances in the tournament, but they must be careful. Brazil has been hurt by 
over-predicting in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Bujones said Germany scares him -- "They are still a team that can compete" -- 
and tabbed Romania as a dangerous dark horse. "Gheorghe Hagi is an unbelievable 
powerhouse," he said. "Even if Romania does not win, Hagi will have established 
himself as a superstar in this World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Bujones smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you can see, I am an avid fan." 
</P>
<P>
 Bujones met his wife when both danced with Stuttgart Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the World Cup," Bujones said. "I love American football too, but I 
think soccer should be part of the American sports scene. Maybe Americans will 
learn to appreciate it now so that when the World Cup comes here again, America 
will be able to win it." MIKE PENNER

 Fans of the Belgian and Moroccan teams coexisted loudly but peacefully Sunday 
under steamy conditions in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Banners were displayed in Flemish, English and French, and fans waved the red, 
yellow and black Belgian flag with more energy than their team showed on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of Morocco, many dressed in the team's red color, also chanted, banged 
drums and waved the red Moroccan flag with the gold star in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 At game's end, there seemed to be no incidents in the stands. But in Belgium, 
a Moroccan youth was shot and wounded in the southern town of Verviers when 
celebrations of Belgium's victory turned violent. The youth was reportedly not 
in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 200,000 Moroccans living in Belgium, about 20,000 of them in 
Brussels, where fighting also broke out between rival supporters on the 
historic Grand'Place. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said some cars were damaged and shop windows smashed in central 
Brussels. There was no news of any arrests. HELENE ELLIOTT

 In a report from Fullerton headlined, "Simpson stole the show: little space

the O.J. Simpson chase upstaged the festivities and opening games of the World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "In case you needed some really typical episode of American life to 
counterattack the invasion of soccer, this was provided with the luxurious 
fullness of cinemagraphic and journalistic detail. To such an extreme that the 
soccer audience ended up being captive to the spectacular coverage of the 
escape and capture of former American football player O.J. Simpson. . . ."

 Coach Jack Charlton tried to interrupt the work of Giants Stadium police, who 
were dealing with euphoric supporters of Ireland after a 1-0 victory over 
Italy: 
</P>
<P>
 "The police were doing their job, but I just tried to say to them that no one 
was trying to assassinate anybody. There was no need for brutality." 
</P>
<P>
 Wrote reporter Rob Hughes, referring to the shooting of six people in a pub in 
the village of Loughinisland in County Down, south of Belfast: "(Charlton) 
could not have known that, even as he spoke, there were dead and dying back in 
Ireland, the work of maniacs picking their victims among people who merely 
wanted to share the joy of arguably the greatest result in the history of a 
nation that, with just 3.6 million people, had the smallest population of any 
at these finals."

 Horned helmets are selling better than ever in the nation's capital. The sale 
of sombreros, however, has slumped badly. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Norway's 1-0 victory over Mexico in front of 52,395 sun-baked fans 
at RFK Stadium on Sunday, the 1994 World Cup's toughest group suddenly has a 
very interesting complexion. 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland and Norway, teams that were supposed to wilt in the heat, share first 
place in Group E. Italy and Mexico, teams that were supposed to do well, are in 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexicans did not play badly Sunday afternoon. The Norwegians simply played 
better and fully earned their first World Cup victory. 
</P>
<P>
 There were always going to be two problems for Mexico: how to unlock the 
packed Norwegian defense and how to stop the larger, physically more 
intimidating Norwegians when they attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until the last 15 minutes that Mexico began to find a solution to 
the first problem. The second they handled superbly and courageously the entire 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Outmanned defensively and outmuscled offensively, the Mexicans played well 
enough to get a tie. Unfortunately, Norway's coach, Egil Olsen, found a way to 
deny them that too. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen chose the perfect moment to make his key substitution, inserting Kjetil 
Rekdal at precisely the moment Mexico was beginning to take the upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Having tried without success all afternoon to dribble or dance their way 
through Norway's impregnable defense, the Mexicans finally resorted to the 
long-range shooting they should have tried much earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 75th minute, Luis Garcia forced Norwegian goalkeeper Eric Thorstvedt to 
fling himself to his right and tip a blistering shot around the post. Garcia 
had been set up by a nice pass from Hugo Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
 One minute later, the Norwegians had another lucky escape when Ignacio Ambriz 
fired another rocket toward the net, only to see it deflect off the base of the 
left post. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's fans, all too quiet for much of the game, suddenly came alive and the 
momentum was all with Coach Miguel Mejia Baron's team. 
</P>
<P>
 In stepped Olsen, sending on not another player to paper over the cracks 
appearing in his defense but rather an attacking midfielder. 
</P>
<P>
 Within eight minutes, Rekdal had scored. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal should have taken the heart out of Mexico, but still it kept pressing 
and was very unlucky not to score in the dying seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, when Hungarian referee Sandor Puhl blew the final whistle, Sanchez 
and company were forced to contemplate yet another defeat. The loss marked the 
seventh time in 10 World Cup appearances that Mexico has lost its opening 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 Norway's victory sets up an intriguing clash with dissent-riddled Italy on 
Thursday at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. That game has all sorts of 
overtones. It was Italy that defeated Norway, 2-1, in the Norwegians' only 
previous World Cup appearance, in 1938. And it was Italy that the Norwegians 
defeated to deny the Italians a place in the 1992 European Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico, meanwhile, is faced with the prospect of an equally difficult game 
against high-flying Ireland on Friday in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither coach can ask more of his players than they gave Sunday. For Mexico, 
defender Claudio Suarez gave a Herculean effort in battling Norway's designated 
striker, Jan Age Fjortoft, who at 6 feet 3, 192 pounds towered over him. Ambriz 
directed the defense as efficiently as ever and goalkeeper Jorge Campos was his 
acrobatic and adventurous self. 
</P>
<P>
 On attack, Mexico time and again was thwarted when it tried to use either Luis 
Roberto Alves on the left wing, Garcia on the right wing or Sanchez up the 
middle. The openings simply did not materialize as the Norwegians flung 
themselves into every tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing a four-man defense, ably marshaled by captain Rune Bratseth, and a 
five-man midfield, Norway was seldom pulled out of alignment. The players kept 
their positions well and the two lines moved as a disciplined unit. 
</P>
<P>
 It all added up to a frustrating afternoon for Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 After the last of the Mexican fans had made their unhappy way out of the 
stadium, the Norwegian fans still were celebrating in the stands, singing, 
dancing, ringing bells, waving flags and cheering their heroes when they came 
back out of the locker room to run barefoot victory laps around the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The horned Viking helmets were everywhere to be seen. The sombreros had long 
since disappeared.

MINOR LEAGUE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER: THOMPSON DEVELOPS HIS GAME WITH QUAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Playing for a struggling organization that's looking to cut costs and has an 
unsettled first-base situation on the major league level figures to be a good 
spot for a young upwardly mobile first baseman. 
</P>
<P>
 But you might not want to use Rancho Cucamonga first baseman Jason Thompson as 
a case in point. Thompson is holding up his part of the equation: he's hitting 
.361 with 13 homers and 62 runs batted in for the Quakes, the San Diego Padres' 
Class A affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Padres sent down opening-day first baseman Dave Staton and are going with 
rookie Tim Hyers, but this is an organization desperate for some kind of winner 
. . . even if it's in Rancho Cucamonga. So their motto this spring has been 
"Don't Break Up the Quakes." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they put this team together for a reason and there was no question 
that they were going to leave it together for awhile," Thompson said. "I think 
I've done my job and I can't control what they're going to do, but if they keep 
me here all year, that's fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a big emphasis here. This is the only team in the Padres' 
organization that's winning. They want to win this championship, and so do I." 
</P>
<P>
 The Quakes finished second behind the Riverside Pilots for the first-half 
championship of the California League's Southern Division with a 43-25 record.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how we've kept him here this long, but I sure like having him 
around," Manager Tim Flannery said. "Jason Thompson can play. He's a guy we're 
going to be watching on TV a few years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got something you can't teach. He really likes coming up with the game 
on the line. That's when he does his best work, when the tying or winning runs 
are on base. And you'd be surprised how rare that is." 
</P>
<P>
 But then Thompson's is a unique case. His circuitous route to professional 
baseball was littered with more cul-de-sacs and apparent dead ends than a 
suburban housing tract. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't start for the Laguna Hills High varsity until he was a senior; he 
was cut from the USC team after a two-day tryout; he played well enough at 
Saddleback College to earn a partial scholarship at Pepperdine, but was told 
after one season he didn't figure in the team's plans, and finally, as a 
walk-on at Arizona, he hit .353 and was a Baseball Coaches Assn. second-team 
All-American in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 He played in the outfield at Saddleback and Pepperdine and was a designated 
hitter at Arizona. At Spokane, the Padres' Class A short-season team, Thompson 
became a first baseman. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing wrong with his abilities," said Flannery, who also managed 
Thompson in Spokane, "he just hadn't played there and it takes time. But he's 
worked very, very hard." 
</P>
<P>
 With Flannery's help, Thompson has been able to apply the same approach to his 
fielding that has made him so successful with the bat. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I really struggled," he said. "I made a lot of mistakes. But during 
the off-season and early mini-camp, I did so much work there that I don't 
really have to think about it anymore and I've developed an all-or-nothing 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're either going to do it, or you're not. You can't be afraid to make 
mistakes. I figure if I miss the ball, I miss the ball, but I'm going with my 
first instinct and hope all that hard works pays off. Do that and you start 
making fewer mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, who once let a couple of bad days turn into an 0-for-31 slump in 
college, no longer can be shaken by a streak of bad hitting, or good pitching, 
or even bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got the perfect makeup," Flannery said, "and he can hit left-handers as 
well as right-handers." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the left-handed-hitting Thompson is batting .382 against 
left-handers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It never really made any difference to me," Thompson said. "It's just a 
confidence thing and I know I can hit. Last week, I struck out four times in 
one game, twice with the bases loaded and twice with guys on third, all with 
less than two outs. Four fly balls would have meant four RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the next day, I was over it and went three for four with a home run." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, who passed over a couple of other young first basemen in the 
organization with a strong performance in spring training, says he felt a bit 
of pressure at the beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 But six home runs in the first 15 games quickly took the edge off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Tim wanted me here but I'm not sure everyone did," Thompson said. 
"But I started off so hot, that took all the pressure off and allowed me to 
just come out and play." 
</P>
<P>
 He suffered from a slight case of long-ball-itis, but has since recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the homers would just keep coming," he said, smiling, "but after 
the first time around the league, they started pitching me differently. I 
started chasing balls out of the zone and wasn't helping my cause. I've always 
had the ability to go the other way and I got away from it a little." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'll get my 20 homers a year, but the key for me is that I think I 
can hit .300 and still drive in 100 guys." 
</P>
<P>
 If he reaches those goals, he figures to ascend through the minor league ranks 
on the express elevator. But Thompson says he's learning from Flannery that 
there is more to success than inflated statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it takes me to carry a team, I want to be in that situation," he said, 
"but the key is to do whatever it takes to win. I've learned to take a key 
walk, to never give up an at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personal success looks so much better when it's coupled with team success. If 
you play on a winner, you look like a winner." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Padres can sure use one. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shake and bake: Thompson sat in the dugout of the Epicenter, the Quakes' 
6,100-seat, state-of-the-minor-league-art stadium and marveled at his luck. 
Sure, the temperature was in the 90s and hurt your lungs to take a real deep 
breath, but he's seen the alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at this, it's so beautiful," he said. "We just made a trip up to 
Stockton and Bakersfield, I guess that's what A ball is supposed to be like. 
We're really spoiled here. I mean this whole facility is like a triple-A or 
major-league ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
 And it goes beyond grass that is green and showers that work. The Quakes set a 
California League attendance record last year with 331,005 fans, bettering the 
old mark by more than 110,000. This season, they're on the pace to draw more 
than 400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't take any effort to get ready to play hard for nine innings here," 
Thompson said. "The other day in Bakersfield, I could hear guys talking all the 
way across the field. Here, you can't even hear yourself think. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even the guys on the other teams can't wait to come here and play."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; DESHIELDS, TREADWAY ARE ACTIVATED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Delino DeShields and Jeff Treadway were activated from the disabled list after 
Sunday's game, with the Dodgers sending Garey Ingram back to double-A San 
Antonio and Eddie Pye to triple-A Albuquerque.  
</P>
<P>
 Before DeShields was sidelined because of a cut middle finger on May 26, he 
had hit .345 with 10 runs in his previous 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't seem like I've really been playing this season," said DeShields, 
who has been sidelined for 25 of the team's 68 games because of various 
injuries. "I think it's all behind me now, I really do, and it's a good 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram, called up May 14 to provide speed off the bench, ended up starting 20 
games at second base. He played well in the field and batted .282 in 26 games, 
with three home runs and eight runs batted in.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind surprised myself," said Ingram, 23. "I was kind of nervous at first. 
I learned more playing in games up here and I think it will help me when I go 
back to San Antonio." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Gott, who had an appendectomy June 9, is on a rehabilitation program that 
includes riding a stationary bike and strengthening exercises. He is expected 
to be sidelined two or three more weeks. . . . Henry Rodriguez made an 
exceptional diving catch in the fifth inning to rob Mike Kingery of a hit and 
Kingery returned the favor in the seventh inning when, after hesitating, he 
made a great catch on the run at the warning track in center field to rob Tim 
Wallach. . . . The Rockies' Eric Young, six for nine in the first two games 
against the Dodgers, walked twice Sunday. MARYANN HUDSON

BULLFROGS SURVIVE A MAJOR ROSTER MOVE TO POUND OAKLAND, 13-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs defeated the Oakland Skates, 13-3, before 9,011 Sunday at the 
Pond of Anaheim, and they did it short-handed once again. 
</P>
<P>
 After scoring three short-handed goals in Friday's Roller Hockey International 
victory over Sacramento, forward Brad McCaughey, who had two goals, added 
another short-handed tally for the Bullfrogs Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Shayne Arsenault had two goals and three assists and Joe Cook added three 
goals and an assist in the Bullfrogs' rout. But the team started the game 
short-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 Colin Ward, a 5-foot-11, 190-pound forward who scored two goals in the team's 
season-opening victory over the Blades, was dealt to the Atlanta Fire Ants for 
defenseman Carl LeBlanc and a third-round draft pick in 1995, Bullfrogs Coach 
Grant Sonier said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was forcefully traded to Atlanta," Sonier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward, 23, was offered an ice hockey contract by the Atlanta Knights of the 
International Hockey League. But Ward could not sign the contract if he played 
roller hockey in Anaheim, Sonier said. The Fire Ants are owned by Richard 
Adler, Charles Felix and David Berkman. They also own the Knights. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have called Atlanta's bluff, but we didn't want to jeopardize 
Colin's ice hockey career," Sonier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward, brother of the Kings' Dixon Ward, will earn $50,000 in the IHL next 
season, Sonier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the Fire Ants obtained another former Bullfrog, Devin Edgerton, 
under similar circumstances. Edgerton played for Atlanta Knights during the 
1993-94 season and is on the Fire Ants' taxi squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Both deals made Sonier bristle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Atlanta had no intention of signing Colin now until they heard he was playing 
for us," Sonier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without a full roster, the Bullfrogs (4-0) were too much for the Skates 
to handle. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13-3 rout equaled the biggest margin of victory for the Bullfrogs, who 
defeated the Skates (1-4) by the same score in the regular-season finale last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs put Sunday's game out of reach by scoring three goals in a 
53-second span in the third quarter to make it, 9-1. Cook then scored two goals 
in a 48-second span to cap a three-goal spurt in a 1-minute 10-second span 
during the fourth quarter to make it, 12-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Savo Mitrovic had two goals and two assists and Darren Langdon added a goal 
and three assists for the Bullfrogs, who outshot Oakland, 45-31. 
</P>
<P>
 Goalie Chris Gordon, in his second start, made 28 saves. He has allowed only 
six goals in two games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we've established a good one-two punch in goal with Rob Laurie and 
Chris now," Sonier said. 
</P>
<P>
 And now the Fire Ants can boast their own Anaheim one-two punch, courtesy of 
the Bullfrogs. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Jim Brown missed Sunday's game, serving a one-game suspension for a 
major penalty (high sticking) he received Friday in the Bullfrogs' 11-6 victory 
over Sacramento. "He's here to score goals, not to take penalties like that," 
Bullfrogs Coach Grant Sonier said. How talented is the 20-year-old Brown? "He 
shoots the puck at an NHL level," Sonier said. "Some guys on our team are in 
awe of this kid. They can't believe how he can handle the puck." . . . Forward 
Bobby McKillop, last season's playoff most valuable player, also sat out Sunday 
night's game. McKillop is rehabilitating a sprained right knee and is listed as 
tentative for Thursday's game against San Jose at The Pond of Anaheim.

NEWSWIRE: WALLACE, PENSKE WIN IN MICHIGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rusty Wallace won the Miller Genuine Draft 400 at the Michigan International 
Speedway in Brooklyn, Mich., to give car owner Roger Penske his eighth 
consecutive victory -- three in Winston Cup and five on the Indy-car circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also Penske's first victory at the Michigan track, which he has owned 
since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace had to overcome a near-disastrous pit stop on lap 176 during the 
seventh caution period of the race. Wallace took an extra lap and the yellow 
flag came out and he ran out of gas as he entered the pits and the engine died. 
As the Penske South Racing crew changed tires and filled the gas tank, crew 
chief Buddy Parrott sprayed ether into the engine compartment as Wallace tried 
to get the engine restarted. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the crew pushed him about 10 yards, with Parrott taking a tumble 
on pit road, the engine fired and Wallace moved back onto the two-mile, 
high-banked oval 11th among the 12 cars on the lead lap with 19 laps to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace, who won at Dover and Pocono the previous two weeks and has five 
victories for the season, was sixth by lap 186, third the next time around, 
moved to second on lap 192 and passed Dale Earnhardt for the lead with three 
laps remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 He pulled away after that, leaving Earnhardt to fend off Mark Martin for 
second place. Wallace crossed the finish line about three car-lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the hardest last 15-20 laps I've ever run in my life," said Wallace, 
who earned $66,890 and led three times for 83 laps. 
</P>
<P>
 A record Michigan crowd, estimated at more than 100,000, turned out despite 
95-degree heat and oppressive humidity.

race. 
</P>
<P>
 Another American, Jeff Krosnow, held his Toyota team together for second after 
losing the lead in the final two hours because of failed gear linkage. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Indy 500 winner Danny Sullivan's team probably had the best car -- the 
other Dauer-Porsche -- but two long pit stops put them in third place. His 
co-drivers were Hans Stuck of Germany and Thierry Boutsen of Belgium.

tires.

 Both cases originated with a complaint filed April 6 by Steve Presto, a former 
project manager at the Mel Blount Youth Home who was was fired in March.

FANS ARE KEPT FROM REACHING THEIR GOAL; SOCCER: MEXICO'S LOSS IN THE WORLD 
CUP'S OPENING ROUND LEAVES BAR PATRONS LITTLE TO CELEBRATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It was not a lack of talent, nor passion, nor pride that caused his beloved 
Mexican futbol team to fall Sunday, said Efrain Ruiz. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were unlucky," said Ruiz, 26, a native of Guadalajara, speaking for most 
of the boisterous crowd watching Mexico battle Norway on television at Las 
Palmas Bar in Santa Ana. "They had many more chances, but today they were 
unlucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's defeat, 1-0, in the opening round of the World Cup left little cause 
for celebration at Las Palmas, a neighborhood bar, nightclub and restaurant on 
17th Street in southeast Santa Ana, where the Mexican flag flies proudly. All 
afternoon, no one found reason to jump up and pound on the conga drums sitting 
silent on the small nightclub stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The disappointed group of about 20 -- much smaller than most Las Palmas futbol 
crowds because the game was broadcast to home televisions -- never got a chance 
to erupt. Although the green-clad Mexican team clearly dominated the second 
half, one missed goal after another only frustrated their faithful. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Mexico had played the whole game like they did the last five minutes, they 
would have won," said Ted Rodriguez of Anaheim, a native Colombian. "They were 
too sloppy." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the teams took the field in Washington, D.C., to begin the match, 
bartender Rudy Robledo admitted he was nervous. So much was at stake, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 70,000 cheering fans at RFK Stadium, many among them fanatics for 
Mexico and Norway, or Noruega , in Spanish, and the rest of the world was 
watching. "I am ready, but I'm a little scared," a smiling Robledo, 30, said 
before the game started. 
</P>
<P>
 On most days that Mexico plays, Robledo must add "150 or 200 chairs" to the 
bar and club to seat all the fans. But on Sunday only about two dozen people -- 
all but two of them men -- witnessed the tightly contested match. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never know here," Robledo said. "Since this is on regular television, a 
lot of people enjoy watching from their back yards, you know, with carne 
asada." 
</P>
<P>
 Like so many bars and clubs around the Southland, Las Palmas has been 
festively adorned with brightly colored World Cup paraphernalia, thanks to the 
beer companies in the United States and Mexico. The matches are duly noted on 
the World Cup game schedule posted on the wall, and, by Sunday afternoon, Ruiz 
was already looking ahead to Friday night's match that will pit Mexico against 
Ireland, or Irlanda , in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every team in the World Cup is a good team," said Ruiz, 26, in halting 
English. "But if Mexico made it to the Rose Bowl, that would be great." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, 32, who has witnessed defeats by Colombia and Mexico in the past 
two days, found solace in the spectacle of soccer, or futbol , being introduced 
in such a grand fashion to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this country will pick up on soccer after the World Cup," said 
Rodriguez, a representative for a graphics company who still plays the sport 
every Saturday in Stanton. "It is so much like hockey or basketball, the same 
kind of game."

PEST-FIGHTING DISTRICT LIMITS STAFF TRAVEL; REGULATION: CONCERNS OVER SPENDING 
PROMPT VECTOR CONTROL TRUSTEES TO RESTRICT THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES WHO CAN 
ATTEND OUT-OF-TOWN WORKSHOPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 They have a new fleet of Chevrolet S-10 trucks, sting-proof suits and cellular 
phones. And they travel in packs -- up to 19 at a time -- to attend conferences 
in Palm Springs, Monterey, Bakersfield, San Diego and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether studying the arcane behaviors of mosquitoes or preparing for the 
arrival of the Africanized honeybee, Orange County Vector Control District 
officials have spared little expense in their battle against pests. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past three years, the district has spent more than $100,000 on 
travel-related expenses for staff and district trustees; $6,000 of that was 
spent in April to send 19 board members and staffers to San Diego for the 
annual American Mosquito Control Assn. meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The district paid another $350,000 to outfit a five-member "killer bee" squad 
with new trucks, spray-guns, cellular phones and protective gear. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when local governments are struggling to make ends meet, the 
district's spending moved vector control trustees last week to rethink their 
own policies and prompted one county supervisor to suggest a reorganization of 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, vector trustees approved new belt-tightening travel regulation that 
will limit the number of employees attending out-of-town workshops. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the board was concerned that it didn't look good for up to 10 people 
to go to one conference," district General Manager Gilbert L. Challet said. "I 
got the feeling that it was getting excessive when we asked who wanted to go to 
one meeting and we had too many hands going up." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on accounts of recent travel expenditures, Supervisor William G. Steiner 
said he wanted vector control to be brought under the direction of the county 
Health Care Agency so that "supervisors could have some control over these 
types of expenditures." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have little basis for comparison, but where are they going?" Steiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said the travel and bee team are necessary expenses to 
carry on the local war against pests of all kinds, even though county 
government faces another lean financial year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the same officials have become concerned that the travel expenses 
could bring embarrassing disclosures that have recently tarred other local 
governments, such as the Santa Margarita Water District, whose administrators, 
among other things, indulged themselves with frequent trips and meals at 
taxpayers' expense. Two top officials in the water district are facing criminal 
charges related to allegations that they improperly accepted gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Controlled by a separate board of trustees representing each of the county's 
31 cities, the vector control district operates independently of the county 
Board of Supervisors and relies on annual fees from property owners to fund its 
$5-million operation. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past three years, district road trips have stopped in Bakersfield, 
Ventura, Visalia, Sacramento, San Mateo, Indianapolis and Fort Collins, Colo.  
</P>
<P>
 On other occasions, the destinations have also included Palm Springs; Ft. 
Myers, Fla.; Monterey; San Francisco, and San Diego. Often, the district is 
well represented. On a January, 1993, trip, for example, six trustees and nine 
staff members attended a four-day vector conference in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Topics at the April conference in San Diego attended by 19 staff members, for 
example, included a discussion on whether mosquitoes are more likely to 
transmit disease when their bloodsucking bites are interrupted by the human 
swat. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Challet traveled to Taiwan and Singapore for discussions on vector 
issues, which included schooling on how deadly Dengue fever can be transmitted 
by mosquitoes in the humid climate there. Challet's trip, however, was financed 
in part by a private foundation and was not billed to the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy approved last week will limit future travel by trustees to no 
more than five board members for each annual state meeting on mosquito and 
vector control. The policy could save as much as $1,800 per trip, Challet said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Barry J. Hammond, also an Irvine city councilman, said the board's 
action evolved from increasing concern that some travel may have been 
unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I come from a city that has a zero travel policy," Hammond said. "The travel 
at vector control seemed to be more than some cities authorize." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, Hammond said some travel has been important for 
staff to keep pace with the regional pest-related menaces created by killer 
bees or the deadly hantavirus, a sickness linked to prolonged exposure to 
certain rodent droppings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure we're treating these problems effectively. We hope any 
limitation on conference travel will truly be for the better of the district," 
Hammond said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vector control had been among the more obscure government operations in Orange 
County until last year, when in an unusual and angry protest, thousands of 
residents wrote letters opposing a 20-cent per month increase in district 
service charges. The fee was raised from $1.10 to $3.19 per year. This year, 
Challet said, the fee is expected to be decreased, but there was been no final 
decision by the district's board. 
</P>
<P>
 Vector board president Grant McCombs and Challet said travel expenditures 
represent a fraction of the district's overall budget and has allowed staff to 
be scientifically current on the most serious pest problems likely to affect 
Orange County residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "No doubt about it, our staff is the best or one of the best in knowing what's 
going on with the hantavirus," Challet said. "If we couldn't afford to send 
these people to conferences to see what is happening in these areas, we 
wouldn't be as effective." 
</P>
<P>
 The $350,000 spent on setting up a killer bee team, Challet said, should pay 
off when local residents learn of the bees' arrival in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as they are detected in California, even if it's in El Centro, we'll 
start getting calls in Orange County," Challet said. "The public is bound to 
get extremely excited, and they really shouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 In preparation for the bees' arrival, estimated to be within months, Challet 
said the district's fully outfitted team is in training: controlling swarms of 
common European bees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll know where the bees are before the public does," he said.

WAND GIVES FINGERPRINT SYSTEM A LIFT; POLICE: ANAHEIM DETECTIVES SAY THE SMALL, 
HAND-HELD DEVICE ENABLES THEM TO PULL 20% MORE PRINTS FROM CRIME SCENES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When two cousins were found shot to death inside a car on Katella Avenue in 
March, police investigators, with the wave of a wand, were able to quickly lift 
fingerprints from inside and outside the vehicle and begin their search for a 
killer. 
</P>
<P>
 The small, hand-held wand can't perform magic, but it is part of an innovative 
new fingerprinting system that the Anaheim Police Department and a handful of 
other law enforcement agencies across the nation have been testing since 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Detective James E. Conley said the 3M Fingerprint Visualization System 
has helped to increase the likelihood of salvaging images from surfaces that in 
the past have yielded few prints. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, the new system, manufactured by the Austin, Tex.-based 3M Co., 
is yielding 20% more fingerprints from crime scenes, Conley said. A company 
representative says the new technique could help police find 50% more prints 
than current techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a great improvement over what we've had in the past," said Conley, 
the department's forensics supervisor. "Since fingerprints are one of the most 
important pieces of evidence that we have, we are in favor of trying anything 
that makes our lives easier and enables us to find more prints." 
</P>
<P>
 Obtaining fingerprints quickly gives detectives a crucial jump-start on their 
investigation, said Anaheim Sgt. Steve Rodig, head of the department's 
robbery/homicide division. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to identify a victim as soon as possible in an investigation and 
obtain any possible information on a suspect," Rodig said. "It's very 
advantageous for us to be able to expedite getting prints." 
</P>
<P>
 An investigator uses the wand to disperse cyanoacrylate vapor (more commonly 
known as Super Glue) over the surfaces to be examined for prints. The vapor, 
which reacts with the moisture and oil of the fingerprints, makes the print 
visible and freezes it on the spot so it cannot be smudged. 
</P>
<P>
 The print can be lifted from the surface in about 30 minutes, instead of the 
usual four or five hours it takes for the more commonly used dust to yield a 
usable print. 
</P>
<P>
 The speed of the process also virtually eliminates any danger of the prints 
evaporating on a hot day, Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like taking the lab out to the crime scene," said David Kemp, a 3M 
projects manager. "It's not unusual for investigators to completely remove a 
door to take it to the lab for processing. That is not only laborious, but it 
can also disturb the latent fingerprints. The beauty of this system is that it 
locks the fingerprints in and you can do your work out in the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it's the scene of an arson, homicide, bank robbery or burglary, Conley 
said the system, which is contained in a small, portable case, has been 
particularly helpful in lifting fingerprints from more challenging surfaces 
such as leather, duct tape, Formica and plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, prints can be repeatedly lifted from a surface once they are 
"frozen." With fingerprint dust, if a print is not lifted properly the first 
time, it can be lost forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Although cyanoacrylate has been used to detect fingerprints for more than 20 
years, the new system enables police to use it in a safer, more convenient way. 
The fumes from the chemical can be toxic if not applied properly, Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp said the new method can locate as many as 50% more fingerprints, because 
more surfaces can be checked for prints.  
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim has not completely abandoned the old process of dusting for prints. 
Conley said the decision to use the new system is made on a case-by-case basis 
and in some situations, it is simply not needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim was one of five cities -- the others are San Antonio, Tucson, Houston 
and Springfield, Mass. -- chosen to test the product because some of their 
personnel already had the technical background needed to use the system, Kemp 
said. The department is using the technology free of charge indefinitely, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology was developed by forensics specialist David Weaver, who was a 
latent fingerprint examiner and forensic artist for the state of Alaska from 
1986 to 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The electronics products division of 3M put the product on the market for law 
enforcement agencies in April. It is currently being used in 12 police 
departments across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feedback we've received has ranged from people saying, 'This is another 
great tool to help us out,' to 'This is the greatest technology we've seen 
developed in the last 30 years,' " Kemp said.

SCHOONER'S TRADE WINDS BECALMED; SPIKE AFRICA'S SKIPPER IS HOPING FOR BRISK 
SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1986, with the death of her husband who built the 33-ton Spike Africa, 
Monika Sloan faced a hard choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I keep the boat? Or do I sell Spike?" 
</P>
<P>
 It had taken Bob Sloan about six years to construct the 70-foot, two-masted 
schooner in the couple's back yard in Costa Mesa. Regarded as one of Newport's 
best sailors, Sloan died of leukemia at age 50 after a career of charter 
boating. 
</P>
<P>
 "After his death, I decided to give myself two years to see how I would do in 
this business," Monika Sloan said. "I was determined to give it a shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Sloan, now 38, is a former model and a nurse, she has earned her sea 
legs, having sailed since age 12. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, Sloan got her skipper's license. She turned to what marketing 
skills she had to get clients for the boat, which has a crew of three. Now, 
eight years later, with another summer coming on, success is slowly arriving. 
</P>
<P>
 The vessel has become a celebrity because of its historic, wooden design in an 
age of fiberglass.  
</P>
<P>
 Spike Africa has been pictured in Vogue, Time, Wooden Boat and Land's End 
catalogue. The Hollywood credits on its resume include the TV series "Riptide" 
and the movie, "Joe vs. the Volcano," in which Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan sailed 
off into the sunset. 
</P>
<P>
 But it hasn't been easy. To help pay maintenance and monthly slip fees that 
can consume thousands of dollars, Sloan has gone back to nursing at a Newport 
Beach pain clinic. "I thought I could do it by being a full-time skipper," she 
lamented. "I can't." 
</P>
<P>
 She hopes for a summer of smooth sailing, which means plenty of sunset 
cruises, weddings, burials at sea, birthday parties and overnighters to 
Catalina Island or the Channel Islands for corporate customers. A four-hour 
private cruise with Spike Africa Sailing Charters costs $850. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't a trip to Tahiti or winning a schooner's cup, "but it helps pay the 
bills," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For non-boaters, the beautiful schooner named after a legendary sailor sits 
out of view of any major freeway while docked in Newport harbor at the Balboa 
Bay Club. But there are few boats on the West Coast with as much celebrity as 
Spike Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Race Spike Africa in San Diego and fans line the dock to see and cheer her. 
Tall wooden ships of historic design have long fascinated the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not as famous as San Diego's Star of India, or the 107-year-old 
sailing ship Balclutha in San Francisco, Spike is the head turner when cruising 
around Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Few of the older-styled boats still charter. And, sailers at Newport Harbor 
believe it's the only one skippered by a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Spike comes into town, people gather on the docks especially when 
there's an American schooner cup race," said Joseph Ditler, 43, with the 
Maritime Museum in San Diego. "Spike has its own fan club. People have a 
favorite schooner, and, well, Spike is that way with people." 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-passenger ship was named after Bob Sloan's friend, Spike Africa, a 
famous schooner sailor, and self-proclaimed "President of the Pacific Ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 "Spike Africa was an Englishman," said sailor and rigger Joseph Soanes, 74, of 
Huntington Beach. "Spike was first mate on the Wanderer, actor Sterling 
Hayden's famous boat. Hayden later wrote a book, and to those who sail, it's 
quite a good book about his travels." 
</P>
<P>
 For Soanes, who rigged Spike Africa before the boat was launched in 1977, 
sailing with Bob Sloan was a glorious adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Sloan sailed through the (Panama) Canal more than 50 times," Soanes 
said. "He was a colorful man and he and the boat went hand-in-glove. To see him 
walk out to the main boom and reef (shorten the amount of sail in high wind) 
was something. He would go back and secure the sail and tie it down -- all 
while underway going along at hull speed. The wind's blowing, the deck's moving 
up, then down. It's quite an experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Those lucky enough to sail aboard the vessel these days say there's a "real 
feeling of heritage," said crew member Colin Emsley, 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember we were at Dana Point with Spike and the fishermen were saying: 
'Hey you don't want to go out there. It's too windy. You don't want to go out 
there,' " Emsley recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "And here's Spike and Monika as skipper, and it's really fun out there taking 
all this wind," Emsley said. "It's one of the few boats we don't call a 'she.' 
It's just got that work boat image. You think of her as more brawn than 
beauty." 
</P>
<P>
 Of Monika Sloan, Emsley said she is an excellent skipper. "She's not too 
disciplined and not too relaxed, just very professional." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Berkeley, Sloan studied nursing at UC Santa Barbara, and met her 
husband through the boating world before they married in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first home was aboard the schooner while we traveled up and down the 
coast from San Francisco to Acapulco," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She learned to sail in a 10-foot "melody" class boat her father bought her. 
Then she took sailing courses at UCSB and later joined the Santa Barbara Yacht 
Club and became interested in racing and crewed in local regattas. 
</P>
<P>
 The schooner has had an active racing career, sailing in schooner, master 
mariner and ancient mariner races. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like the word 'yacht' to describe Spike Africa. It's too clubby," 
Sloan said. "Spike Africa is not a yacht. It's a working boat." 
</P>
<P>
 Sloan said she and her husband operated a yacht delivery business, sailing 
luxury yachts from the East to the West Coast crossing the Panama Canal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always accompanied my husband on these deliveries, standing my watch, 
preparing meals and pulling my weight," Sloan said. 
</P>
<P>
 For her, it's became a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think just the enjoyment of getting away from land excites people," Sloan 
said. "A place where you can shut off the engine and get away from the hum and 
bustle of life here in Southern California. The sea is a different place that 
allows you to focus on simple pleasures." 
</P>
<P>
 "There just isn't anything else that I would rather be doing," she said.

WORLD CUP / USA 1994; A TALE OF TWO COUNTRIES; SWEDISH, CAMEROONIAN FANS ARE 
WORLDS APART IN PREGAME PARTYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Those Swedes. They do know how to party. 
</P>
<P>
 They started early Sunday in Manhattan Beach, well before stroke of noon, 
drinking beer and painting their faces and getting ready for the big one at the 
Rose Bowl. Some of the dozen or so Swedes at the posh beach house had been on a 
binge since the middle of the week, powering down 30 brews a day in preparation 
for this game of games, the country's opening round in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning could not have been more different, however, for another clutch of 
fans -- of the opponents, Cameroon. They woke in dormitory surroundings at the 
University of Southern California and were shuttled to the Hereafter 
Non-Alcoholic Supper Club in the Crenshaw area of Los Angeles. There they ate 
bread and butter and doughnuts and drank tea laced with lots of sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 And then the Cameroonians wondered aloud how they were going to get to 
Pasadena because the bus ride they had counted on had fallen through. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the story of fans and their day at the World Cup, the most-watched 
sporting event on the planet. It is one of those days when national pride 
struts its stuff, when the home flag is waved and hung from trees and held out 
the window during the drive to the stadium. It is a time when chests puff out 
and everyday caution is abandoned. It is the reason that soccer sometimes turns 
ugly. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Swedes who came here this week was Michael Christiansen, 23, of 
Lund. When he had been an exchange student in Los Angeles, Christiansen stayed 
with Greg and Ellen Hull of Manhattan Beach, he an accountant, she a teacher. 
So it was that he went there again for the World Cup, along with two friends, 
Rikard Persson and Fredrik Johansson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been partying nonstop since we got here," Johansson said early Sunday 
afternoon. "We just want to show our support for the Swedish national team. 
This is like a monthlong Super Bowl and we wanted to be here for it." 
</P>
<P>
 They closed several bars in the days leading up to the match and had gotten 
only a few hours of sleep the night before. When they awoke Sunday, 
bleary-eyed, they began pulling out fake plastic swords, Viking hats and 
inflatable headgear with the word Sweden emblazoned on them. Then they 
commenced to drink more beer. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had not been so kind to the fans of Cameroon, the African nation that 
stunned the world of soccer four years ago by reaching the quarterfinals in the 
World Cup. There had been the problem with the exhibit at Leimert Park, where 
the Cameroonians had hoped to sell artifacts from their homeland to help offset 
the expenses of the trip. But they had not gotten the right permits and found 
themselves mired in the red tape of bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 But they too had had some fun the night before the game, many of them going to 
a party at a South-Central social club. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were up late last night, dancing and singing," said Alexandre Oho Bambe, a 
leader of the Cameroonian delegation, who wore blue jeans, a Cameroon World Cup 
T-shirt and goatskin slippers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Hereafter Non-Alcoholic Supper Club, three rented vans pulled up to 
carry the fans to the Rose Bowl. They piled in, 14 or more to each car, along 
with several private cars that formed the Cameroonian convoy. 
</P>
<P>
 And at Manhattan Beach, the Swedes did their own squeezing as well, filling 
two Ford Broncos with 14 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time for the Viking war!" Christian exclaimed as they were getting ready 
to leave. Then they all gave a fierce growl as the Bronco eased onto the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to experience the World Cup," said one driver, Steve Compas. "Just 
to see the fans." 
</P>
<P>
 As they drove along, a caravan of cars and vans filled with Cameroonians 
passed them, their national flag waving from a window. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get them, get them!" the Swedes yelled in mock fierceness. Then they settled 
back to sing songs from the Ventures and occasionally break into dog howls. 
When they arrived at the Rose Bowl, they started looking for the Swedish 
tailgate party. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, the Cameroonians took a crazy-quilt path on and off freeways 
that took more than an hour to bring them to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like they say in Cameroon, it isn't easy, but they get it done," sighed a 
cook from the Hereafter, Myron McDowell, who had joined the Cameroonians. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After purchasing enough pennants to cut the dealer's per-unit price from $3 to 
$2, the Cameroonians strolled the last few blocks to the Bowl, passing a crowd 
of 150 Swedes who had hoisted their flag in a eucalyptus tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "5-0!" yelled one blond-haired, twentyish Swede. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, in favor of Cameroon!" replied Amos Bello, 47, who was garbed in the 
native robe of a tribal chief and a multicolored knit hat in the afternoon sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Bello, a train manager for the Cameroon Port Authority, had been unhappy with 
the difficult logistics of the morning but was smiling when he finally entered 
the Rose Bowl. "We made it here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the gate, the group met up with dozens of other Cameroon natives, including 
Solomon Tataw, the tribal chief of the village of Mamnyu. 
</P>
<P>
 Tataw, who wore a ceremonial feathered hat, a camera and what appeared to be a 
Turkish towel around his neck, said he is enjoying his stay in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were still a young man, I wouldn't like to go back home," said the 
chief, who left his three wives and seven children back in Cameroon. 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside, the Cameroonians were greeted with loud support from Egyptian and 
Scottish soccer fans. They took snapshots of each other with the smoggy San 
Gabriel Mountains in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 About 45 minutes later, the Hereafter fans were supplemented by boisterous 
Cameroonian students from American colleges -- as well as employees of a 
Cameroonian cement company -- who hoisted a flag and a large sign in 
Cameroonian colors saying "It's Milla Time!" -- referring not to beer but to 
soccer star Roger Milla.  
</P>
<P>
 At game time, the paint was melting from the Swedes' faces in the Pasadena 
sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
 During the tailgate party, they played soccer, listened to a tape of surfer 
music and occasionally broke into the ever-popular dog howls. The fare had been 
reduced to hot dogs and German potato salad because they had eaten all the 
Swedish food earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the Swedes began to march to the Rose Bowl. One carried a banner of a 
Swedish beer label. Another had a flag draped over his back. They passed other 
clusters of Swedes and exchanged high-fives. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the stadium, travel booking agent Rudi Schreiner sat in the midst of 
the chanting Cameroonians. He had bought a ticket from a scalper outside the 
stadium and the only hat he had been able to buy was one designating him as a 
fan of the Swedish team. He looked very much out of place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I bought the wrong hat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next two hours, each group got to celebrate twice as their teams 
fought to a 2-2 tie. But the festive mood dimmed at that result. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are disappointed," said Cameroonian Noel Seaha. "For us it is a defeat. If 
we won, we would be drinking and dancing until tomorrow. Now we will sleep and 
wait for Brazil." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a better team than them," echoed Christiansen of the Swedes. "We 
should have won." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Swedes set off to find a bar.

STREET SMART: TIME TO TAKE CAR-CRAZY CLICHE ON A ONE-WAY TRIP TO JUNKYARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We Californians love our cars like no other Americans. We drive them more 
often and farther than anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 We are road junkies who drive mile after mile, addicted to the lure of the 
freeways which we ply with radios blaring and hair streaming in the sun. We are 
different from other states. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 In 36 states, there are more vehicles per capita than in California. In 36 
states, people also drive more miles per capita than we do. Forty-two states 
use more gasoline and diesel fuel per capita than we do. And 37 states have 
more licensed drivers per capita than we do. 
</P>
<P>
 The notion that Californians are car-crazy is a "pervasive myth that's hard to 
kill. It's not based on any rationality, fact or research," said Martin Wachs, 
professor of urban planning at UCLA. "We are not substantially different from 
other areas of the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the average motorist drives less than the national average, 
weighing in at a mere 12,944 miles. (In Georgia, by contrast, the average 
driver travels 15,835 miles.) In New Hampshire, over 44% of households have two 
vehicles, the highest of any state. Why not call them car-crazy? 
</P>
<P>
 The hard truth, experts say, is that Californians enjoy this myth not because 
of any compelling evidence, but because of their ignominious past.  
</P>
<P>
 By 1929, there was one car for every nine people who lived in Los Angeles. In 
East Coast cities, the ratio was one for every 25, Wachs said. In the years 
since then, the driving patterns and ownership numbers have evened out, Wachs 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The cliche, however, flourished. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got the rap from New Yorkers," said Charles Lave, professor of economics 
at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 It's repeated so often that it evolved into an urban legend. And the auto 
manufacturers egg us on. What greater tribute to car culture than a vehicle 
name? Ferrari California. Chevy Malibu. GMC Sonoma. Chevy Bel Air.  
</P>
<P>
 It's this cultural phenomenon rather than a statistical basis, some experts 
say, that gives rise to phrases referring to Californians as "long in love with 
their cars" (Chicago Tribune), or having a "long-standing love affair with the 
automobile" (San Francisco Chronicle), or "addicted to freeway travel" 
(Washington Post), or having "always worshiped at the altar of the automobile" 
(L.A. Times). 
</P>
<P>
 "California rises above the rest of the country in generating enthusiasm for 
doing something with a car, rather than using it solely for getting from Point 
A to Point B. In California, a guy . . . likes to enjoy a car; he doesn't want 
to drive a Plain Jane," said Dean Batchelor, a consultant to the L.A. County 
Museum of Natural History's Petersen Automotive Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 More than anywhere else in the nation, said Thomas L. Bryant, editor of Road & 
Track, a car has become a symbol of our identity. "A lot of our self-image in 
California is tied up with what we drive."  
</P>
<P>
 Such talk makes Daniel Sperling roll his eyes.  
</P>
<P>
 Sperling, director of the UC Davis Institute of Transportation Studies, has 
heard it all. 
</P>
<P>
 "People do value cars very highly, they value the attributes of the cars; it's 
not based upon some ephemeral aesthetic. It's the privacy, freedom, security, 
and mobility that cars provide," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of that means that Californians are having a love affair with their cars 
-- and why should we? Choking smog. Persistent congestion. Drive-by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, in a recent survey of Southlanders, 30% said that they are very often 
bothered by traffic congestion and 49% reported that their commute has become 
worse. Of those surveyed who changed residences within the last two years, one 
in four cited commute-related reasons, compared with one in 10 two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians are about as in love with their cars as Floridians are. No more, 
no less, Sperling and others say. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey -- not California -- was the birthplace of the very first drive-in 
restaurant. And the first drive-in mortuary opened in Atlanta. Drag racing? 
That started in the Appalachian South. "If we want to talk about car-crazy," 
said Alan Pisarski, a national transportation policy consultant, "the people 
who are really ca r-crazy are Europeans," where cars are driving down the use 
of mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there are enough anecdotes scattered across the landscape to 
convince you that we are special in some ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Numbers notwithstanding, the Southland is the Mecca of motoring modsters, from 
drag racing and drive-in restaurants to hot-rodders and lowriders. Two of three 
major car enthusiast publications -- Road & Track and Motor Trend -- are here, 
as well as a host of car clubs.  
</P>
<P>
 Motorists here are able to make less practical choices of vehicles because we 
enjoy mild winters (with little rain to rust precious car bodies) and no snow 
(so corrosive salts are not spread on roads).  
</P>
<P>
 "There are two sets of people in this country. The vast majority look at a car 
as an appliance, but then there is a significant group who really like cars and 
like to be involved with them," Bryant said. "California has more car 
enthusiasts per capita."

DEVELOPER DEMAND INTENSE FOR HOUSING UNITS; GROWTH: THE VENTURA COUNCIL WILL 
MEET WITH OTHER OFFICIALS TO START DECIDING WHO WILL BE ALLOWED TO BUILD, AND 
WHEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On file in Ventura's planning department is an 11-page document listing the 
proposals for 2,661 housing units that builders want to construct in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 On the planning rule books is another number: 1,081, the number of homes that 
the city has pledged to permit through 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the City Council will meet with planning commissioners and other 
officials to start deciding which developers will be allowed to build, and how 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 On one extreme, some residents say Ventura should continue as it has for the 
last four years and not allot any new developments except lower-income 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some who agree that growth would be good for the economy balk at paving 
over more lemon groves for another housing tract. 
</P>
<P>
 But the developers are offering enticements, and some council members -- who 
will have the final word -- say they find some offers very attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a very open mind on it all," Mayor Tom Buford said, adding that 
developer Eric Wittenberg's proposal to build 439 homes in east Ventura is 
particularly interesting because, as an incentive, Wittenberg would provide 22 
acres for a veterans nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
 Those 439 housing units -- proposed only recently -- are not included among 
the 2,661 already seeking approval, but may be added to the tally Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jack Tingstrom, on the other hand, said he likes a deal put forth 
by developer Ron Hertel. Hertel wants to give Ventura $2 million to build a 
park on property he owns at Telephone and Kimball roads, in exchange for the 
city's blessing to build 437 homes on a city-owned lemon orchard at Telegraph 
Road and Petit Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people in the community are really in favor of it," Tingstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many are also against it. They are circulating petitions for a ballot measure 
to stop the Hertel development and all construction on land zoned for 
agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members and planning commissioners agree that they face tough choices 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably one of the most challenging issues the council will 
address," Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council created its latest housing ceiling five years ago when the city 
revised its comprehensive plan. Bound by county-mandated air pollution and 
population-control standards, city leaders set strict limits on future housing 
allotments until the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 With 900 units set aside for the downtown area, where the council has focused 
a major redevelopment effort, slightly more than 1,000 allocations remain 
elsewhere for the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Demand is intense, in part because the city has not given any allocations 
since the summer of 1990. During a three-year drought, the city put a 
moratorium on all new building. Then, last year, council members again put new 
construction on hold while they informed developers that they wanted incentives 
in return for permission to build. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never had quite such (an application) crunch as we have now," said 
Karen Bates, a city planner. "We only have this limited ceiling and we have all 
these developers with developable land." 
</P>
<P>
 Is it frustrating for builders? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an understatement," said Wittenberg, who in addition to his 439-home 
proposal has also filed an application to build 105 homes east of Saticoy 
Avenue and north of North Bank Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started applying in the late 1980s and I've tried every year ever since," 
he said. "You go to the city and they rate your project and decide to give you 
some or none or what-have-you. . . . It's difficult, but then it's difficult in 
all cities these days." 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members and planning commissioners say it is crucial for the 
city, in giving its first allocations this decade, to be cautious and mete out 
housing slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of bargaining power," said Ingrid Elsel, chairwoman of the 
Planning Commission. "I certainly don't think we should give everything away 
this year that we have to offer." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gary Tuttle said he wants to designate about 180 of the city's 
allocations this year. That amount, he said, should go to a housing development 
proposed for the Ventura Avenue area by the Neel and Huntsinger families and 
Kinko's, the national copy service headquartered in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle said the aging Avenue area needs new development. And he is leery of 
issuing all 1,018 permits too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not about to give away 200 to Kinko's this year and 400 to Wittenberg 
next year and 500 to Hertel the year after that and that's it, we're done with 
housing allocations for the next five years, so let's rewrite the comprehensive 
plan so we can get more housing," Tuttle said. "If any council members want to 
do that, they're in for a bloody fight." 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Jim Monahan said that approving as many developments as 
possible this year could be a big economic boost for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, we're so far behind in that area," he said. "That many houses being 
developed this year would really enhance employment in the area. It's 
construction and only short-term, but it makes a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 2,661 units proposed for development, slightly more than one-third 
would be condominiums, mobile homes and apartment buildings. The rest would be 
single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tingstrom said some of that housing should be affordable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking for a house and, I'm telling you, there's nothing out there," he 
said. "You have so-called affordable housing that starts at $160,000, but I 
don't know who that's affordable to." 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents agree, citing the lack of reasonably priced housing as 
Ventura's biggest development problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are moving out of the area because they can't afford homes 
here," said Debbie Davidson, 32, a renter in mid-town Ventura. Davidson said 
she knows people who moved as far as Nevada, Oregon and even the Midwest in 
search of housing in their price range. 
</P>
<P>
 "Myself, I'd like to see something for $140,000 that's not a condominium," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yvonne Aguilar, 45, said the city also needs more low-priced apartment 
rentals. Aguilar shares an apartment with her son on Ralston Street because she 
cannot afford to live on her own in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking for a place for myself but all the (rents) are too high," she 
said. "They start at $700 to $800 per month, and that's not including 
utilities."

FARM FATALES; WOMEN'S GROUP IS PROUD OF ITS ROOTS IN AGRICULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sipping margaritas and nibbling enchiladas, the women talked of pigs. Sick 
pigs, slaughtered pigs, smelly pigs, fat pigs. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was perfectly acceptable dinner-table conversation for members of 
Ventura County's chapter of California Women for Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Gathering in Santa Paula's Familia Diaz restaurant each month, a dozen of 
CWA's most active members swap anecdotes and advice in fast-paced, unstructured 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 They can talk about virus-stricken pigs and know that they'll get sympathy. Or 
they can chat about carrots, whine about weeds, gab about grapefruit. Whatever. 
They know that their fellow diners will understand. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what CWA is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 This may be the only women's club where the president can announce a "citrus 
cover crop field trip" -- an excursion to check out the greens growing between 
lemon trees -- and elicit a round of genuinely excited "ooohs." 
</P>
<P>
 It's certainly the only forum where an elegantly dressed woman can gush about 
her upcoming wedding -- and, in the same breath, lament that she doesn't have 
enough freezer space to store big hunks of freshly slaughtered pork. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all coming from the same perspective," said Arlene Pinkerton, a 
longtime CWA member whose family has farmed in Ventura County for decades. 
"It's a very good support group." 
</P>
<P>
 And support can be vital for farming women, as Shelley Johnson found out years 
ago when she started telling friends about her family's 100-acre citrus ranch 
along the Sespe River. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really proud to grow things to feed people," Johnson recalled. "But 
even my sister put plastic covers on the furniture when I came to visit. You 
know, people thought of me as a dirt farmer." 
</P>
<P>
 To change that hayseed, country bumpkin image, the 45 local members of 
California Women for Agriculture have pressed a low-key public relations 
campaign designed to teach residents about the farming community. 
</P>
<P>
 Under chapter President Donna Hale Pinkerton, the group will also strive to 
attract at least 100 new members this year, targeting anyone with any links to 
the agricultural industry. Even consumers are welcome -- anyone who has ever 
mashed an avocado into guacamole or shredded lettuce for a salad can join. So 
can men, despite the CWA's outdated name. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County chapter of CWA has already attracted women from a variety 
of fields. 
</P>
<P>
 There are farmers, who work the land themselves, and consultants, who help 
exporters market produce. There are home gardeners who potter around in 
back-yard plots and pest experts who produce scientific videos on fruit flies. 
And there are unabashed pig fans, such as Robin Dick, whose license plate 
declares HUG HOG. 
</P>
<P>
 They all share a common goal: to learn more about farming and share their 
information with Ventura County residents, especially children. "We want kids 
to know that it's not as simple as 'Mama, I want some milk, so let's go to the 
grocery store,' " said Donna Hale Pinkerton, who took over the CWA's presidency 
in the fall after sharing the job for a year with her cousin Arlene. 
</P>
<P>
 By teaching children how their food gets to supermarket shelves, she said, "we 
want to show them the grocery store's not the be-all and end-all." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an exciting time for agriculture here -- there's a great deal going on," 
she added. "It's a time to be proud of agriculture in Ventura County." The CWA 
members do their best to get that message across. 
</P>
<P>
 They hold yearly Salute to Agriculture dinners to recognize pioneer farm 
families, and they hold a Supervisors' Luncheon each spring to explain their 
views to local politicians. They also work on Ag in the Classroom programs, 
which bring farmers to elementary schools around the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have such a high concentration of city people here, people who don't have 
any connection with agriculture," said Karen Wetzel, a CWA member who helps 
organize Ventura County's farmers' markets. "People need to know how important 
agriculture is to our county, our state and our country, period." 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent vocational fair, the CWA booth displayed charts showing all the 
jobs associated with agriculture, from the obvious (fruit picker, tractor 
mechanic, lemon sorter) to the more subtle (water engineer, soil scientist, 
chemist). 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson also presided over a table laden with goods made from agricultural 
byproducts. Teen-agers wandering past her exhibit learned that items they may 
use every day -- shampoo, glue, bubble gum -- contain animal parts, such as 
hides, bones or horns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the kids to know that animals are not just good for food," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the county's agriculture industry remains vibrant -- crop sales 
topped $848 million last year -- many farm-lovers fear that runaway development 
will soon encase fertile fields in concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 To encourage the younger generations to preserve Ventura County's agrarian 
heritage, CWA offers $2,500 worth of scholarships each year for students 
pursuing agricultural careers. The money can be applied to college courses in 
any related field, from home economics to landscaping to veterinary medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 And while they're helping students pursue degrees, CWA members do a fair 
amount of learning themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Lupe Ortiz, for example, realized a few years ago that she didn't have a clue 
what her husband and brothers-in-law did on their huge citrus and avocado 
ranches outside Santa Paula. "They kind of kept me in the dark," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While she was raising four children, she was too busy to care about being left 
out. But when her kids left home, Ortiz began to think more about her husband's 
life work. 
</P>
<P>
 She sought answers at CWA. 
</P>
<P>
 Since she started attending the monthly meetings, which usually feature a 
guest lecturer, Ortiz said she's gained "a lot of knowledge about the way 
things work." The group, she added, "seems like a good way to get involved."

EAST VENTURA IS PLACID, BUT POPULAR; SUBURBIA: MANY RESIDENTS SAY THEY'RE HAPPY 
WITH THEIR QUIET CORNER. BUT SOME SUGGEST THAT THE AREA WOULD BENEFIT FROM A 
DEVELOPMENT PLAN. 
</P>

<P>
 Sheri Vincent thinks that her neighborhood is boring. 
</P>
<P>
 And she'd like to keep it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't really anything to do out here, but that's OK," said Vincent, who 
bought her white stucco slice of the American Dream four years ago and has 
lived happily near the intersection of Telegraph Road and Petit Avenue ever 
since. "I don't want entertainment. I will drive for that. That's why I live in 
east Ventura." 
</P>
<P>
 Bounded by the Franklin Barranca on the east and congested Victoria Avenue on 
the west, the sea of single-family homes loosely called east Ventura has its 
own unique atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always call it the part of Ventura that's really in Orange County," said 
Bill Fulton, a Ventura resident who publishes the California Planning and 
Development Report, a statewide newsletter. "East Ventura is really just a 
bedroom suburb." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, definitions of what constitutes Ventura's eastside differ widely. 
</P>
<P>
 Some insist that eastern Ventura starts around the Ventura College area, on 
Telegraph and Day roads. Others would place the division east of downtown, 
where the thrift stores peter out and the houses and other types of retail 
shops begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Ventura old-timers, remembering when Ventura Avenue was the city's 
primary neighborhood, sweepingly refer to everything but the Avenue 
neighborhood as "east Ventura." 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike the city's other neighborhoods, where bustling commercial districts 
lie only blocks from quiet residential streets, the community east of Victoria 
Avenue is suburban sprawl. A few strip malls with supermarkets and video 
stores, an occasional citrus orchard and the Southern California Edison plant 
are virtually all that lie between one housing tract and another. 
</P>
<P>
 Professional planners say the fields and vacant lots dotting the area could 
give way to clusters of cheery shops, offices and restaurants, transforming the 
housing tracts into communities where residents walk and bike their way through 
most of their errands. 
</P>
<P>
 But City Council members say, after more than two decades of concentrating on 
the city's eastern half, they've now turned their attention to the west, where 
they hope to enhance such neotraditional communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've pretty much set the direction on where we want to set our efforts for 
the next 10 to 15 years," Councilman Gregory L. Carson said. "We're mostly 
focusing on the downtown and the (Ventura) Avenue area." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is just as well, as far as Vincent and many of her neighbors are 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryle Estes, a resident of the Woodside Greens tract near Harper Drive and 
Kennebec Street, said that between her neighborhood's great Chinese restaurant 
and all the activities offered through the local elementary school, she's 
happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see the need for any more than we already have out here," she said. 
"I like the open areas. It's nice to keep the space." 
</P>
<P>
 Only 30 years ago, east Ventura was all space -- space and citrus groves, with 
a few homes sprinkled between. City planners looked out over the verdant fields 
and saw a new suburban frontier, said Everett Millais, Ventura's top planner. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vision at that time was (that) one day, there would be no agricultural 
land left," he said. "There would be development from the shore to the 
hillside." 
</P>
<P>
 Housing tracts began to snake across the fields, aided by construction in the 
mid-1960s of the Ventura Freeway and the Santa Paula Freeway, which made it 
easier than ever to commute home to Ventura's east end. 
</P>
<P>
 Home buyers such as Jack Tingstrom, then a manager at GTE, flocked east to 
purchase the new, affordable units and stayed to raise a family. Now a City 
Council member, Tingstrom lived at the same address on Concord Avenue until 
last year, when he moved to an eastside condominium. Tingstrom said his family 
liked the original home's price, as well as the idea of being the first people 
to live in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members began having second thoughts in the mid-'70s about the 
development drive. Trying to preserve some of the area's remaining farmland, 
the council created an agricultural greenbelt that winds about the housing 
tracts, offsetting acres of sidewalks and single-family units with rows of 
orange and lemon trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in 1979, the City Council backpedaled even further, putting strict 
limits on the number of housing units approved for construction each year. From 
1990 to 1993, the building of new housing across Ventura came to a screeching 
halt as the city declared a drought-imposed development moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
 But before Ventura imposed the moratorium and after it lifted it, developments 
continued to sprout along the wide boulevards and neighborly avenues of the 
east end, interrupted every few miles by a strip mall or corner gas station. 
</P>
<P>
 Excluding Montalvo -- a community in the area's southwest end that is one of 
the oldest neighborhoods in Ventura -- the sea of newer tract homes that is 
east Ventura boasted 38,476 people in 1990, according to U. S. census data. 
</P>
<P>
 That means that more than a third of Ventura's total population, estimated in 
1990 at 92,575, lives east of Victoria Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The median household income in the east end is $46,450. Eighty-four percent of 
all residents 18 years and older graduated from high school and 22% graduated 
from a four-year college, according to census records. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the median household income for Ventura as a whole is about 
$40,000. Eighty-four percent of Ventura residents 18 years and older graduated 
from high school, and 24% hold bachelor's degrees, census records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Racially, the area mirrors the larger city, with 77% of its residents white, 
18% Latino and 5% black, Asian or other minority. 
</P>
<P>
 A product of the development fever of past decades, the community has in the 
'90s evolved into one of the most adamantly slow-growth neighborhoods in 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it should cease -- all of it," said Wanda Blomberg, who has lived 
near the intersection of Rubicon Avenue and Telephone Road since 1977. "I do 
not want to see any more development." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, almost every development proposal for the east end engenders its own 
war of words and politics at City Hall. Often, those who fight most intensely 
against encroaching construction are the homeowners whose own tract sits atop a 
recently razed fruit orchard. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, one of the most searing battles raging through the east end this year 
concerns a local developer's proposal to give the city money and land for a 
park in exchange for the right to build homes on a lemon grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Even residents usually opposed to new construction glow when they speak of 
eastern Ventura getting a large park. Enthusiasts envision acres of grassy 
soccer and baseball fields, a shimmering outdoor public pool, perhaps even some 
golf greens, all sprinkled with happy suburban families cheerily engaging in 
outdoor sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids could really benefit from a park, and we really do need more 
facilities for the children," said Don Nesbit, a resident of Flagstaff Court, 
near the intersection of Jasper Avenue and Telephone Road. 
</P>
<P>
 But homeowners who recently poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into their 
new houses next to the city-owned lemon orchard hold a much less rosy view of 
the proposed land swap. 
</P>
<P>
 Developer Ron Hertel has suggested swapping his 94 acres at Telephone and 
Kimball roads for the city's 87 acres at Telegraph Road and Petit Avenue. Both 
properties are now considered part of the agricultural greenbelt and would have 
to be rezoned for different uses to make the deal work. 
</P>
<P>
 Hertel proposes building a park on his present property, which he would help 
finance with $2 million of his own money. In return, he wants permission to 
raze the orchard and construct 437 homes on the city's land. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent, who moved across the street from the lemon orchard four years ago, is 
leading a petition drive to require each proposed development in the greenbelt 
to have a citywide vote before it can be approved. The ballot measure -- which 
draws its most fervent supporters from eastern Ventura -- grew out of local 
opposition to the Hertel proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Other development proposals for the east end also wait in the wings: 
</P>
<P>
 * Eric Wittenberg, a Newport Beach-based developer, wants to build 439 homes 
on 33 acres southeast of Telephone Road between Saticoy Avenue and Wells Road. 
In return, he pledges to donate 22 adjoining acres to the city for a 400-bed 
veterans nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
 * Local builder Brad Jones hopes to develop 467 homes on 222 acres of lemon 
orchards just east of North Hill Road between Foothill and Telegraph roads. He 
promises in exchange to build public tennis courts, an 18-hole golf course and 
a clubhouse, also on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 * Retired schoolteacher Bill Martin has applied to build 60 apartments on 23 
acres east of Wells Road and south of Darling Avenue. Eventually, he says, he 
hopes to construct office buildings, markets and retail stores in addition to 
the apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Professional planners say any future development on the eastside should be of 
the type that Martin is proposing -- an interspersing of businesses and 
housing, and not just another formless tract of single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The suburban development standard . . . makes a feeling of neighborhood very 
difficult, because it is focused on automobiles," planner Millais said. "In 
terms of planning principles, it's been found to be a very inefficient use of 
land." 
</P>
<P>
 Fulton, of the statewide planning newsletter, insists that the city needs to 
get serious about charting future development rather than approving east 
Ventura housing developments piecemeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Ventura has become is a charming county seat . . . with an Orange County 
suburb tacked on," he said. "If you want to turn east Ventura into a place that 
feels like it's part of Ventura, then you've got to plan that area." 
</P>
<P>
 Wally Wolf and other local business owners would like to see that planning 
include lots of retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "I opened this on the east end because there isn't anything on the east end," 
Wolf said of his business, Computer Repair & Maintenance, in the Alpha Beta 
shopping center on Telephone Road. "The east end's being built up a lot right 
now and it needs some good, clean businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Quickly, Wolf ticks off what he considers a few, pressing local needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could use a small Target-type store," he said. "We've only got one 
hardware store out here. We could use another. I personally would love to have 
an electronics store." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Osborn and his sons, Ray and Joe, opened the Pet Stop, a supplies and 
grooming store on Citrus Drive near Wells Road, in February and say their 
clientele increases substantially each month. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no other pet supply or grooming facility out here," Bob Osborn said. 
"I think this area needs to grow up more. There's more housing being built and, 
with more housing, there's more demand for businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Ventura Mayor Richard Francis couldn't disagree more. Francis lives in 
the Woodside Cottages tract, near Telephone and Jasper. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in the 'burbs and I like that," he said. "We have the best of all 
worlds. Downtown is dense and alive. Mid-town is a little less dense and a 
little less alive. And the eastern end of town is quite less dense and quite 
unalive. 
</P>
<P>

AT-RISK STUDENTS COMPLETE COURSE OF ACTION; THEY OVERCOME OBSTACLES TO EARN 
THEIR DIPLOMAS FROM MOORPARK COMMUNITY HIGH 
</P>

 Jose Zamora realized a few months ago that he had one more chance to finish 
high school and that he had better not blow it if he wanted to make something 
of himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was at work, holding a shovel and a pickax in my hands," the 18-year-old 
said. "I just started thinking, 'This is no kind of life. I have to finish 
school.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora is one of 16 graduates from Moorpark Community High School's class of 
1994. The school is a last resort for students at risk of dropping out or for 
those who have been kicked out of regular high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the normal day-to-day travails of teen-agers, many of these 
students have faced almost overwhelming obstacles to earning their high school 
diplomas, ranging from pregnancy to working full-time jobs to being kicked out 
of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora, a cherub-faced young man with an imposing 6-foot, 2-inch, 280-pound 
frame, was sent to the school midway through his sophomore year at Moorpark 
High School. Zamora's father had walked out on his wife and nine children, he 
said, forcing the family to go on welfare until Zamora and his brothers could 
find work. 
</P>
<P>
 He stopped going to school and started working as a day laborer, hefting 
bricks with his brother or doing other work at construction sites for $50 a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't interested in school then. I didn't like it," he said. "But 
Community High School was the first place that I read a book from cover to 
cover. It's where I realized that I didn't want to be hanging out on the corner 
with the other paisanos waiting for work all my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, high school diploma in hand, Zamora plans on going to a culinary academy 
to become a chef. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora was one of 80 students at Moorpark Community High this year. School 
administrators estimate that about 15% of the students end up quitting. But 
those who stay and tough out their problems overcome sometimes tremendous odds 
and earn a real high school education, avoiding the alternatives of getting a 
General Education Diploma -- or dropping out altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good number of students stumble and fall when they enter high school or 
junior high," said Gabino Aguirre, Community High principal. "Whether they can 
get back up is the question. These kids are challenged; maybe they find 
themselves pregnant or they got someone pregnant or whatever, but, for the most 
part, when they come here they decide to work. They make the most of the 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 When 18-year-old Leidy Morales moved from Los Angeles to Moorpark with her 
mother, she had to make up a months-long absence from the classroom. She said 
her mother tried to force her to quit school so that she could help out at 
home. The friction between the two finally forced Morales to move in with her 
boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Completing high school has always been very important to me," Morales said 
recently. "My mom and I haven't talked for a while so I mailed her an 
invitation to the graduation." 
</P>
<P>
 At the graduation ceremony last week, Morales came to the podium twice to 
accept scholarships she received for academic excellence. As she accepted her 
diploma, she looked into the crowd and was suddenly overcome by emotion: There, 
sitting among family members of other students, was her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the most beautiful day of my life," Morales said. "It's something 
I've been waiting for, and seeing her there touched my heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Making it through high school and moving on in life is the goal of most 
students at Community High School, Aguirre said. He sits down one-on-one with 
each new student to review the requirements for earning a diploma. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers closely monitor all assignments, math problems and homework. As each 
task is finished, the student is awarded credits toward graduation. The school 
allows for scheduling flexibility and independent study to accommodate 
students' work schedules or the time they need to care for children. 
</P>
<P>
 The flexibility has helped students like Anita Ventura, 17, take care of their 
babies. Anita, who won't have enough credits to graduate until the fall, said 
that when she became pregnant with her daughter Margerita two years ago, 
teachers and administrators at the regular high school wrote her off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different here," she said. "If you need to talk to somebody, Gabino's 
there all the time, and teachers work one-on-one with you." 
</P>
<P>
 Anita, who spoke briefly at the graduation, said she wanted to finish because 
she was anxious to go to college and become a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the first things students ask when they come here is, 'How long will 
it take to finish?' We have a lot of self-motivated students," Aguirre said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said students are often focused on everyday struggles and have given little 
thought to life after high school. He said he tries to make all students aware 
that, if they try, they can go on to college. 
</P>
<P>
 However, only six of this year's 16 graduates plan on attending college in the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, some kids are saying 'No, thank you,' " Aguirre said. "I just want 
them to understand that the opportunity is there if they want it." 
</P>
<P>
 Many graduates will face unemployment or have to settle for jobs at local 
fast-food restaurants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, that concerns me. The reason a lot of these kids won't get jobs is 
that the economy is depressed," he said. "We do our best to help them tap into 
the resources out there that they can use to find jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Graduate Shane Pinney, 18, is looking for a summer job so that he can save 
enough money to go to Hawaii and work in his grandfather's pizza parlor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figure I'll go there and decide what I'm going to do," Pinney said. "I'd 
like to become a writer or a musician. I'm not sure about college, but anything 
is possible." 
</P>
<P>
 In two weeks, Pinney's fellow graduate, James Anthony Roberts, 19, will be at 
boot camp, beginning a four-year stint with the Marine Corps. Roberts, who was 
kicked out of regular high school for fighting was then kicked out of his home 
after disagreements with his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his life was mired in problems when he enrolled, Roberts said 
Community High School forced him to think about his future. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a while there, I was working 50 or 60 hours a week at Carl's Jr. to pay 
the rent," he said. "That's all I could think about. It took having someone 
from the school coming down to talk to my manager before I realized what I was 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he cut back on hours and started focusing on school. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of us had storybook lives," he said "But we all came to the point where 
we said we want (a high school diploma), and that's all that matters."

OAK PARK RESIDENTS SEEK OWN ZIP CODE; MAIL: ACTIVISTS ARE HOPEFUL THAT THEY MAY 
FINALLY GET FIVE DIGITS APART FROM AGOURA HILLS. IT'S A MATTER OF IDENTITY -- 
AND INSURANCE RATE SAVINGS -- THEY SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They have been trying unsuccessfully for years to convince the U. S. Postal 
Service that they shouldn't share a ZIP code with Agoura Hills, but now Oak 
Park residents have a glimmer of hope that they might someday have five digits 
to call their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The unincorporated community of nearly 15,000 in eastern Ventura County now 
shares the 91301 ZIP code with Agoura Hills in Los Angeles County, an 
arrangement that residents say costs them more than just their identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Their ZIP code request recently passed two of three Postal Service hurdles 
toward approval, winning endorsements from local and state administrators. Now 
it has been submitted to federal authorities for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the local level, we have endorsed the concept of a (separate) 913 ZIP code 
for Oak Park," said Terri Bouffiou, a spokeswoman for the Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouffiou said she did not know how long the request would take at the national 
level, but that the outlook for final approval is positive because the change 
would probably have little financial impact. 
</P>
<P>
 However, she said, the request could still encounter some problems because it 
is not based on improving mail service, but on issues of community identity -- 
traditionally not a topic that the post office tackles. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park residents have lobbied for a ZIP code of their own for nearly 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 In their dogged pursuit of the elusive five numbers, they have tugged 
demandingly on the sleeves of many local politicians, perhaps most persistently 
on that of Supervisor Maria VanderKolk, who declares the Oak Park ZIP code 
battle "a major frustration" of her term. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do Oak Park residents care so much about a seemingly benign bureaucratic 
designation that lumps them with a portion of the San Fernando Valley? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is largely financial. Residents say they continually fight to 
persuade insurers that they should be allowed to pay lower, Ventura County 
rates on health, car and home insurance, even though their ZIP code appears to 
place them in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It costs Oak Park a lot of money to be associated with Agoura Hills," said 
Ron Stark, a member of the Oak Park Municipal Advisory Council. "We don't get 
the benefit of living in Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Diane Milavetz recalled the time eight years ago that her health 
insurance company sent her a letter accusing her of falsifying her address. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wrote me a letter saying how I had lied, cheated and owed them extra 
money," she said. "It was pretty nasty." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, whether she is headed to the Department of Motor Vehicles or an insurance 
agent, Milavetz makes a point of carrying with her a copy of her property tax 
bill and her voter registration card -- proof that she really does live in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordering from catalogues is another problem: Many companies assess sales tax 
based on ZIP codes. So a Father's Day sweater ordered by an Oak Park resident 
might be taxed at the Los Angeles County rate of 8 1/4% instead of the Ventura 
County rate of 7 1/4%. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk's office inherited the problem when she was elected in 1990. Her 
office won one concession from the post office in April, 1991, when officials 
said Oak Park residents could use Oak Park 91301 as their return address, 
rather than Agoura 91301. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk aide Lenora Kirby said she started working on "the ZIP code caper" 
in 1991. "(The post office) said, 'You can now use the name Oak Park -- that's 
it,' " she said. "I was pretty thrilled about that." 
</P>
<P>
 But the problems associated with sharing the Los Angeles County ZIP code 
continued, and residents asked again for some action. VanderKolk went to Rep. 
Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), who began representing the community 
after congressional district lines were redrawn in 1992. He agreed to back the 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, a letter signed by both Beilenson and VanderKolk was sent to 
postal officials requesting the change. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Ross and Stark said they are happy to have Beilenson on their side, but 
insist that the issue should have been addressed at a county level first by 
VanderKolk. The supervisor, they say, should have asked her colleagues on the 
board to adopt a resolution supporting the request. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kirby said VanderKolk would have introduced the matter to county 
supervisors had she thought that it would have done any good. "We would have 
done it in five minutes," Kirby said. "Having a ZIP code is a federal issue. We 
went as far as we could at a local level." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross said he has documents from the post office recommending that the request 
be handled first by local government -- in the unincorporated community's case, 
the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have confidence that if (Beilenson's) office is really pushing for it that 
it will happen," Ross said. "I just feel bad about burdening him with the 
effort." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bouffiou said a ZIP code request does not need to come from the Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes no difference whether a congressman or a local citizen or the 
chamber of commerce makes the request," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson aide Diane Kinzer Brown said the congressman was happy to take on 
the issue. "We felt it was a reasonable request or we wouldn't have taken the 
action," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk said she is tired of being attacked at Municipal Advisory Council 
meetings about the issue. "I have never in my life been so frustrated over an 
issue," she said. "A letter from Tony (Beilenson) and myself is the best thing 
we could do." 
</P>
<P>
 Bouffiou said the post office has determined that giving Oak Park a ZIP code 
would be relatively inexpensive, as long as it begins with 913 and not 930, as 
do most Ventura County ZIP codes. Envelopes with ZIP codes beginning with 930 
go to Santa Barbara to be sorted, and the expense of shifting Oak Park's mail 
from the San Fernando Valley to Santa Barbara would be considerable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those numbers really do mean something to us," Bouffiou said. "They're not 
just arbitrary and capricious. They weren't set up on the lines of how 
insurance rates should be established. We need them to create efficient mail 
processing." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that if the request is approved by federal authorities, the Postal 
Service would then survey Oak Park residents to make sure that the majority of 
them really want a new ZIP code. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has turned out before that a chamber of commerce has requested a change 
and that the community has said they don't want it," Bouffiou said. "They don't 
want to learn new numbers or get new stationery and checks printed. People are 
resistant to change." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross said he thought that most residents would embrace the change. "I don't 
think you can get 100% agreement on anything, but I think a majority of the 
people in the community would approve it."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; MEETING TO FOCUS ON DIVERSION FOR YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerns about a "growing youth crisis" in central Anaheim will be expressed 
to Mayor Tom Daly when he meets tonight with about 500 members of the 
interfaith Orange County Congregation Community Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Father John Lenihan, pastor of St. Boniface Catholic Church in downtown 
Anaheim, said the mayor will be asked to take the lead in supporting programs 
aimed at diverting youth away from drug use and gang activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on comments from 54 community meetings and a survey with more than 3,000 
responses, OCCCO is calling for the city to offer additional sports and 
recreational opportunities for youth, along with summer jobs, a computer lab, 
family support programs and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang activities and drug use are "getting worse rather than better" in central 
Anaheim, Lenihan said. He attributes part of the problem to cuts in city 
recreational programs in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The OCCCO meeting with Daly is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. at St. Boniface 
Catholic Church, 120 N. Janss St. near Lincoln Avenue and Harbor Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Boniface describes the OCCCO as "a voice of the people, particularly the 
poorer people and the Hispanic folks." 
</P>
<P>
 The group was founded in 1985 and now represents 50,000 families in six Orange 
County cities. ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; VINTAGE CARS BEGIN RACE ACROSS U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of spectators in Huntington Beach watched as more than 80 drivers of 
pre-World War II cars cranked up their old engines Sunday and took off on a 
14-day, 4,300-mile automobile race across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars ranging in age from a 1910 Knox to a 1933 SS-100 Jaguar were 
participating the 12th annual Great American Race, competing for $250,000 in 
cash and prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 The cars, which must not go faster than 50 miles per hour, must be at least 50 
years old to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the drivers and navigators of the vehicles Sunday were decked out in 
vintage racing attire, complete with soft leather helmets, goggles, scarves and 
gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 The race is one of the world's largest old-car rallies. 
</P>
<P>
 Stability, rather than speed, is the objective in the race, which is scored 
much like a golf game with the driver closest to zero points the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors determine the ideal time it would take to cross secret checkpoints 
along the route. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the racers are judged as to how well they match up with those times. 
</P>
<P>
 The only instruments the racing teams are allowed to use are a clock, a 
stopwatch and speedometer. 
</P>
<P>
 The race started around noon at the Huntington Beach Pier and will travel over 
deserts, mountains and plains before eventually ending at Wilkes-Barre, Penn. 
</P>
<P>
 The course covers 14 states and make stops in 45 cities. MATT LAIT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; ABOVE-GROUND CABLE BOXES IRK RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some residents who live at the south end of the city are unhappy about the 
recent installation of above-ground cable boxes placed in front of their homes 
and in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Bonnie Cosgrove said that the "big ugly boxes" are offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, they clutter up the environment," Cosgrove said. "I 
just feel that it's very unattractive and it affects the value of my property 
and the looks of my neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors Gary and Wendy Royes also are upset about the cable boxes that will 
link homes with a high-tech fiber-optic cable system being installed by Paragon 
Cable. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Royes said that a cable box, called a pedestal, installed last week 
between her home and her neighbor's blocks access to her side yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It limits the use of our property," she said. "Our major gripe is there was 
no public hearing to get our views on what they were doing to our area." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Royes also said that the cable boxes detract from the neighborhood, which 
has underground utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that because of their concerns, the cable company agreed to install 
the sidewalk pedestal closer to the curb and street, instead of near the 
property line. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood is bordered by Hamilton Avenue on the south between Magnolia 
and Bushard streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald D. Weddle, Paragon Cable's director of public affairs, said last week 
that the company has received complaints from other residents as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are going to be a number of people unhappy," he said, adding that the 
company wants to work out homeowners' concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to have their input. It's important," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Barnard, deputy city administrator, said that at the city's request, 
the cable company has agreed to notify residents of the installation and to 
work with property owners to place pedestals in locations that are least 
intrusive and do not pose a safety hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 Weddle said because of the nature of the system, there is not much leeway on 
the placement of the cable boxes, which are being installed in utility 
easements and stand no taller than 30 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only have a few feet one way or the other to move them and maintain the 
integrity of the cable system and make it work optimally," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, Irvine residents also complained about the installation of 
pedestals by Dimension Cable, saying that the boxes were ugly and decreased 
property values. 
</P>
<P>
 Weddle said that the cable company is under a franchise obligation with the 
cities it serves to rebuild the existing cable system. 
</P>
<P>
 The $17-million fiber-optic system will nearly double the current channel 
capacity from 45 to 80 channels and will improve picture quality and 
reliability, Weddle said. The equipment must be placed above ground since 
underground moisture could damage circuit boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Work started a couple months ago to link the first 2,000 homes in the southern 
portion of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Weddle said that 5,000 of the pedestals will be placed within neighborhoods in 
the cities the cable company serves, including Huntington Beach, Stanton, parts 
of Garden Grove, Fountain Valley and Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of 1996, Weddle said, Paragon Cable will be able to link an 
estimated 200,000 households within these cities with the new cable system.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OAK VIEW; HABITAT FOR HUMANITY TO SELECT HOME BUYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Habitat for Humanity of Ventura County, a nonprofit organization that provides 
low-income housing, has scheduled a series of meetings for local families 
interested in purchasing a residence in Oak View. 
</P>
<P>
 The house, the second of two homes being built by Habitat volunteers on 
donated land in Oak View, will cost about $50,000 to construct, a spokeswoman 
said.The selected family will be able to purchase the home with an 
interest-free mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 The family selection committee has planned several orientation meetings for 
interested families of five or more people living in the cities of Ventura, 
Ojai and Santa Paula, as well as the unincorporated areas of western Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Meetings will be held at 2 p.m. Saturday and 7 p.m. June 27, 28 and 29 at the 
Oak View Christian Center, 195 Mahoney Road. Habitat hopes to choose a family 
by August, the spokeswoman said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; POLES EXPECTED TO CAST PROPER LIGHT ON 
PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 50 ornate cast-iron light poles sat rusting away in Hall Canyon for 
nearly 35 years, relics of a downtown Ventura from the turn-of-the-century era. 
</P>
<P>
 But when members of San Buenaventura Heritage, a historical preservation 
group, learned about the poles recently, they jumped at the chance to restore 
five of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are magnificent," said Steve Cummings, president of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason old iron light poles are so exciting to Cummings and others is that 
the group has been toiling 16 years to meticulously restore Dudley House at 
Loma Vista Road and Ashwood Avenue in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 A Queen Anne-style structure built in 1892, Dudley House is nearing its public 
debut. The 13-foot poles have fluted columns and elaborate bases with rosettes 
and other floral designs, perfect for the era that Dudley House will depict, 
said Steve Harberts, a Ventura architect who is overseeing the restoration 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think they are great because we can get the historical accuracy we wanted, 
starting right out in the parking lot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudley House will be a living museum where people can see rooms and Victorian 
architecture as they existed in Ventura from the late 1800s to about 1929, 
Harberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heritage organizers hope to open the house for holiday bazaars and other 
fund-raising events this winter, said Marie Lakin, a spokeswoman for the group. 
</P>
<P>
 But Heritage is made up of volunteers, and nearly all the money for 
restoration comes from infrequent fund-raisers and donations of time, labor or 
money. The latter is most valuable when it comes to the detailed work of 
restoring a 100-year-old home, Lakin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation has already spent $400,000 on the project, Harberts said. But 
major work remains, including laying cement walkways, installing railings on a 
wheelchair-access ramp and decorating the house. 
</P>
<P>
 The group needs some "really hefty guys" to help lift the 500-pound poles onto 
workhorses. The top layer of rust must be sanded, primer applied, followed by a 
final coat of paint, Cummings said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the lights are so heavy, they must be seated in concrete four feet 
deep. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cummings, Harberts and others think the work will be worth it. Dudley 
House is envisioned to include a community room and brick terrace where public 
concerts would take place, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a tremendous asset for the city," Cummings said. KAY SAILLANT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; FIRE DEPARTMENT MAY GET AMBULANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials are studying whether money can be saved in the Fire Department 
budget by consolidating its services with nearby cities and providing ambulance 
transportation services. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Chief Marc Martin said he has contacted La Habra and will ask other 
cities if they would be interested in consolidating services.The move could 
save at least $100,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Fire Department is considering further savings by providing 
its own ambulances, a service offered by a private company that charges for 
transport to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Fire Department is given approval to provide ambulance service, Martin 
said, residents would no longer get billed for the service. Should the plan be 
passed, Fullerton would become one of only five cities in the county with its 
own ambulance service. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a plan still in the works, the Fire Department would propose hiring more 
paramedics and buying ambulances, Martin added. 
</P>
<P>
 City paramedics currently respond to emergency calls but do not provide 
ambulance transportation to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents pay $20 a year for emergency services. But those services only 
include medical care by the city's paramedics -- not rides to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way, residents would get both" services, Martin said of the proposed 
changes. "We may not charge less, but we would provide more."MIMI KO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; CORONER SAYS GIRL, 3, WAS BEATEN TO DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coroner's officials said Sunday that a 3-year-old Nevada girl whose body was 
found in a canyon near Fillmore had been beaten to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a 5 1/2-hour autopsy Sunday morning, the Ventura County coroner's 
office determined that Mailin Thao Stafford died from abdominal injuries 
characterized as part of battered child syndrome, Deputy Coroner Mitch Breese 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's stepfather and mother, Carlos Perez Gutierrez and Tara Ray 
Gutierrez of Reno, have been arrested on suspicion of murdering the girl and 
are being held without bail in the Washoe County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the mother reported Mailin missing Thursday, the stepfather later 
admitted to police that the girl had died Wednesday after he had beaten her. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Gutierrez and the girl's mother drove Mailin's body to Grimes 
Canyon Road between Fillmore and Moorpark and threw it down a steep hillside. 
Although Gutierrez later led police to the area, police said Sunday that they 
were not certain why the couple made the 10-hour drive to dump the girl's body 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's deputies joined Reno police in searching the area and 
found the girl's body about 10 a.m. Saturday. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; MUSIC PROGRAM SEEKS ITEMS FOR FUND-RAISER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The parent organization that funds the Pleasant Valley Elementary School 
District's instrumental music program is seeking donations of furniture and 
other items for a garage sale fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 Save Our Kids' Music will hold a garage sale from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. July 1 and 
2 at the Los Primeros Structured School auditorium on Ventura Boulevard in 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an agreement that Save Our Kids' Music forged with school officials more 
than two years ago, the group reimburses the district for every dollar that it 
spends on the band program. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization is raising money to cover the $7,000 it still owes the 
district for last year, in addition to beginning payments on the estimated 
$52,000 bill for next year. The money primarily covers teachers' salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 students in the district are learning to play musical 
instruments through the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Save Our Kids' Music asks the parents of each student who takes music classes 
to contribute $152 per year, but not all parents do. 
</P>
<P>
 People interested in donating items for the garage sale will be able drop them 
off at the Los Primeros auditorium from 6 to 8 p.m. June 25 and 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Save Our Kids' Music will also pick up donated items for no charge. For 
pickup, call Reese Copsey at 484-2415. MAIA DAVIS

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; SCIENCE FOUNDATION NEEDS BIGGER BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Outdoor Science Foundation needs to expand its corporate 
membership and board of directors to raise the funds that help county 
schoolchildren learn more about their environment. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-year-old foundation, recently given nonprofit status, raises scholarship 
and grant funds for science programs run by the county's Department of 
Education, Development Director Patti Huber said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Education Department's Inside the Outdoors Science Study programs send 
about 47,000 students a year to day and overnight field trips around the county 
and its environs. Programs such as the Outdoor Science School and the Wild 
Wetlands program are each geared toward specific age groups, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 These field trips have become self-supporting over the past six years because 
of budget cuts, Huber added. School districts contract with the department at a 
cost of $16.50 a day and $220 a week per student. The foundation works to 
provide scholarships and grants to the schools, based on the percentage of 
needy students and fund-raising efforts in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, Huber said, a trip to the mountains might be the first time a child is 
away from home without a parent. "A lot of socialization goes on," Huber said. 
"The students have a role model, they work together in small groups and the 
meals are structured as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Memberships for corporate sponsors range from $500 for the annual associate 
membership to $10,000 for a lifetime member, Huber said. The foundation also 
needs to expand its board from the current 11 to 21 members, she said. 
Interested companies and individuals should contact Huber at (714) 966-4339.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; MOVE TO NEW MAIN LIBRARY IS UNDERWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The centerpiece in the Newport Beach public library system closed last week 
while books, magazines, newspapers and videos are being moved into the new 
$8.2-million library building a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials locked the doors of the Newport Center Library on Thursday night and 
for the next three weeks will be preparing for a July 12 grand opening at the 
new library. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are ready to go," said Tom Johnson, assistant librarian. "I think the 
community will really appreciate" the new library. 
</P>
<P>
 The 54,000-square-foot library, still under construction at 1000 Avocado Ave., 
will provide a spacious setting four times larger than the cramped quarters on 
San Clemente Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the library's doors are scheduled to swing open in three weeks, the 
entire move will not be completed until the end of August. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project started seven years ago," Johnson said. "It is nice to put a cap 
on it." 
</P>
<P>
 During the move, library patrons can use the three Newport Beach branch 
libraries. The Mariners and Corona del Mar branches will extend their hours to 
include the next three Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 People may also return materials at any branch or at the drop slot at the old 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, officials of the Newport Art Museum are considering expanding into 
the old library building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to link the two buildings with a walkway to double our gallery size," 
said Michael Botwinick, the museum's director. 
</P>
<P>
 Botwinick said that art officials have already begun a campaign to raise the 
$4 million to $6 million needed to construct the walkway, renovate the old 
library building and provide a substantial endowment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody pretty much agrees that if we can raise the money that we should go 
ahead and do it," he said. BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; APPROVAL LIKELY FOR AUTO CLUB PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Sandra L. Genis said she is more satisfied with the expansion plans for 
the Automobile Club of Southern California than she was two weeks ago, when she 
led a council delay of a vote to approve the large project. 
</P>
<P>
 Genis argued that the 500,000-square-foot addition to the Auto Club processing 
center at 3333 Fairview Road will bring more traffic than engineers have said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Genis' request, the traffic engineers who helped produce the environmental 
impact report spent the last two weeks rechecking the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Genis said Friday that she is now satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 "The information that I have from staff has addressed a lot of my concerns," 
said Genis, who is a professional land-use planner. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two big issues for me from day one have been traffic and an adequate 
balance of housing versus employment. I'm fairly confident that these issues 
are not going to be a big stumbling block." 
</P>
<P>
 Auto Club executives recently sent the city a letter saying that if their 
project is not approved, they will want to move to another city. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion could more than double the Auto Club's work force in Costa Mesa 
to 2,509 employees, making it the city's largest employer. 
</P>
<P>
 Other council members contacted last week said they want the project to 
succeed and believe it will be approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm optimistic, because I have faith in my fellow council members that they 
couldn't possibly be considering driving this business out of town," Councilman 
Peter F. Buffa said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm mildly optimistic," Councilwoman Mary Hornbuckle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Genis said people who attended the June 6 meeting and did not get to speak 
will be given the first opportunity to speak at tonight's public comment 
section.WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; TEAMWORK PAYS OFF FOR NEW SERGEANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Whiteleys seem to have one of those almost perfect marriages -- they golf 
together, study together and pack pistols together. 
</P>
<P>
 And when two sergeant slots opened in the Police Department, the 
husband-and-wife cop team muscled out 12 other applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 The muscle in this case was largely in the mind. The two-day sergeant's exam, 
which included written, oral and group testing, was designed to select 
supervisors strong on "people skills, good-sense community policing and 
problem-solving," Capt. Gene Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Whiteley and Jackie Gomez-Whiteley spent nearly a year of their young 
marriage preparing for the moments last month when each was handed a copper-, 
gold- and chrome-plated sergeant's badge. 
</P>
<P>
 They both firmly believe that the secret to their success in marriage and on 
the job is teamwork. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that we were both shooting for No. 1, it really helped," 
Gomez-Whiteley said. "I don't think I could have studied the way I did without 
being married to John." 
</P>
<P>
 When she was down, shut in one of their home's his-and-her study rooms, with 
her motivation draining away, he would prop her back up, she said. And when the 
situation was reversed, Gomez-Whiteley would be her husband's cheering section. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jackie put together over 2,000 flash cards," Whiteley said, recalling the 
"ton of books" they studied. "We did a lot of cross-teaching to each other." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple went beyond the case law and policy manuals that make up much of 
the written exam and hired a consultant at Cal State Los Angeles to coach them 
through the interview process. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, surrounded by a lieutenant and five captains from other precincts 
throwing "situationals" at them, "we watched other guys make the mistakes we 
would have made," Gomez-Whiteley said. 
</P>
<P>
 They talk shop for many of the few hours they have together while he is on 
night shift and she is on days, Whiteley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talk about learning points because we're both supervisors now," he said. 
"We want to apply what we've learned." 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes the shop comes to them, as it did recently when a young resident 
Whiteley knew from his time on the gang unit approached the couple at a 
restaurant to assure them he was no longer one of the gang. 
</P>
<P>
 But they make a point of nurturing friendships outside of the department to 
add some diversity to their private lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen too many guys, they come into this profession and they get a skewed 
view of society," Whiteley said. 
</P>
<P>
 They met several years ago when she was on the motorcycle and wanted to become 
a detective. He was in criminal intelligence, eventually helping to start the 
department's gang unit, and things took off from there, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 He liked her athleticism and outgoing personality. She liked his maturity and 
"his reputation for always doing the right thing," she said. "He is very 
honorable." 
</P>
<P>
 Whiteley and his colleagues in the department also support Gomez-Whiteley in 
her status as the Police Department's first female sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 7 1/2 years since she started, the officers have always treated her 
well, she said, even as she started competing with them for higher rank. 
</P>
<P>
 A double-cop marriage also eases some of the stress that cop-civilian couples 
have, they noted, because each has confidence that the other knows how to stay 
alive and unharmed while on patrol.LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; LAWS PROPOSED ON ADULT MATERIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Planning Commission tonight will review proposed ordinances that deal with 
adult videos and publications sold in newspaper racks. 
</P>
<P>
 The task before commissioners is deciding what newspaper vending machine 
periodicals are obscene or harmful to minors -- standards the city can use to 
restrict their display on newsstands, Assistant City Atty.Tim Cremin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the news rack "blinder" ordinance before the commission, any periodical 
displaying parts of the human anatomy considered obscene would be required to 
cover most of the rack. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ordinance includes lengthy definitions of what is considered 
obscene and harmful material, including words, pictures or illustrations 
showing sexual acts. 
</P>
<P>
 The adult video proposal would tighten the city's zoning regulations on where 
and how X-rated videos could be sold and rented. 
</P>
<P>
 After a year of research and public hearings, the City Council recently 
established zoning laws that limit where adult businesses could open in Mission 
Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission will decide whether to recommend the adult video and the 
newspaper rack ordinance to the council, which has the final say on the issue.

L.A. SCENE / THE CITY THEN AND NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 He rose from being a flatfoot in the Los Angeles Police Department to become 
chief of police, and then the city's highest public servant -- its mayor. No 
one before or since has ever done both. 
</P>
<P>
 But he found greater fame in a seemingly endless series of personal scandals. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Missouri-born Charles Edward Sebastian was appointed police chief 
in 1910 after 10 years on the force, his handsome looks caused Angelenas to 
sigh when he passed them on the street. In a city of big-bucks political 
muscle, Sebastian had instead worked his way up from ranch foreman to railroad 
grip man, sanitation inspector to police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 His bold initiative made him a local hero; as police chief, he helped capture 
a railroad employee who walked into the police station wearing a grotesque mask 
and carrying 53 sticks of dynamite and threatened to blow the place up. 
Sebastian's friends begged him to run for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 After he acquiesced and announced his candidacy, his political troubles began. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months before the 1915 election, Sebastian and a high-ranking police 
officer were indicted in the death of William Jackson, a disabled homeless man 
who was beaten to death in jail Jan. 30, 1915. The indictment had apparently 
been concocted by his political enemies, and the matter was dropped within 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 That gave Sebastian second thoughts about running, lest the campaign disclose 
his longstanding relationship with a woman named Lillian Pratt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His political enemies tried anew. Two months before the election, he was 
arrested again and accused of contributing to the delinquency of a minor -- 
Pratt's sister, 16-year-old Edith Serkin. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial ended less than three weeks before the election. Serkin testified 
sensationally that she always accompanied her sister when she visited Sebastian 
in Room 17 of the Arizona Hotel at 330 W. 1st St. She said she watched them 
"dally sexually." 
</P>
<P>
 But jurors acquitted him. Thousands hailed the verdict with a torchlight 
parade down Broadway. Sebastian, in the uniform of chief of police, waved and 
bowed from a chauffeur-driven automobile. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on May 31, the eve of his certain election as mayor, someone fired two 
shots at him, barely missing. Once again, Sebastian's enemies used it to their 
advantage: Sebastian was arrested on Election Day and charged with framing an 
assassination plot to boost his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Either in spite of it or because of it, he was still elected mayor. These 
charges, too, were soon dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite all the scandal and turmoil, Sebastian continued to see Pratt. 
Once he was mayor, he became bolder. On an official trip with his wife, Elsie, 
he wrote Pratt several love letters. One said: "I wish you could have been 
along, instead of the Old Haybag." Sebastian neglected to mail the epistles and 
Mrs. Sebastian discovered them. 
</P>
<P>
 Her rage was so great that she took the letters to the Record, a newspaper 
that shared her disappointment with the mayor. The paper ran the letters on 
Page 1 under this large headline: 
</P>
<P>
 "THE HAYBAG LETTERS!" 
</P>
<P>
 Now the good folk who had once cheered him turned their backs. Sebastian 
slipped rapidly into disfavor and resigned in September, 1916, after barely a 
year in office. He only said that poor health prompted him to bring his career 
to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 He tried to run a grocery store. He sold drinks at a dance pavilion. He even 
attempted to open a detective agency, but was denied a license "in the best 
interest of the public," the prison board declared. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney who once tried to put him behind bars finally gave him a 
job as an investigator. But he left the district attorney's office and began 
what was to prove his last career: running a gas station at Vermont Avenue and 
Santa Monica Boulevard. He earned enough to send his only son, Charles Francis 
Sebastian, through Stanford Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1921, Mrs. Sebastian tried for a third time to divorce him. (Her earlier 
attempts, charging desertion, failure to provide and mental suffering, had been 
denied.) This time her accusations involved social standing. Her husband had 
let his membership in the Masonic Lodge lapse, causing her to lose her position 
in the Order of the Eastern Star, the Masonic auxiliary. A judge granted the 
divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyal Lillian Pratt had stayed with him through scandal and divorce. Together 
with their dog, Barker, they rented a secluded cottage in Venice, where they 
did live happily ever after. 
</P>
<P>
 After years out of the public eye, Sebastian suffered a stroke and, scarcely 
able to move or speak, was wheeled up and down the street by his longtime 
mistress.  
</P>
<P>
 On April 17, 1929, Sebastian died at the age of 56 in the arms of the woman 
who had shared his triumphs and shame, but never his name. CECILIA RASMUSSEN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; FATHER, SON PROUD OF EACH OTHER'S MBA 
</P>

 Tim Saunders, 52, is a proud father. His son, Scott, received his master's of 
business administration degree from UC Irvine on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Scott Saunders, 25, is also a proud son. 
</P>
<P>
 His father received his MBA from UCI on Saturday, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a really good work ethic," the younger Saunders said about his dad, a 
Laguna Hills resident who founded Mission Pest Control. "He gets a lot out of 
his time. With work and school, he still goes out and does social events. It's 
really impressive." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Saunders has equally good things to say about his son, who earned his 
bachelor's degree in physics from UC Santa Barbara before attending UCI. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scott's the intellect in the family," he said, detailing study sessions in 
which his son would tutor him in statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 The two didn't have any classes together because Tim Saunders participated in 
the executive MBA program for working professionals, while Scott was in the 
regular MBA program. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Saunders said it felt a bit strange stepping foot on a college 
campus again after 30 years away, but that eventually he made new acquaintances 
among the shorts and T-shirt-clad young people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt comfortable," Tim Saunders said. "But I think occasionally they 
mistook me for a professor instead of a student." 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Saunders said he will use his new business management knowledge to 
improve his pest control company, which he founded in 1975 with two employees. 
Today, 45 employees are on his payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Saunders will move to Washington for a job with the Department of 
Defense. He had attended UCI on a Defense Department scholarship. LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; SWEEPING CONTRACT GOES TO IRVINE FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A one-year street-sweeping contract has been awarded to Irvine-based Sunset 
Property Services, which uses sweepers powered by compressed natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweepers produce 95% less carbon monoxide and particulate emissions than 
sweepers powered by diesel fuel, company President John Howhannesian said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's sweepers also use a regenerative air system designed to 
recirculate air inside the vehicle, rather than expel dust and particulates 
into the environment, Howhannesian said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $300,000 contract with the city calls for general sweeping of residential 
and business streets, along with main arterials and city parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Fred Sorsabal said the company was chosen because it has 
demonstrated "a commitment to provide state-of-the-art solutions for cleaning 
the environment, as well as services that are responsive and innovative."ALAN

 "Parents might have concerns about whether we'll be ready on time," said Wood 
Canyon Principal Dianne Hoff. "Parents also don't know who the staff are. We'll 
introduce them at the meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoff said she hopes the first steps toward forming a Parent-Teacher Assn. can 
be made at the meeting.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; CITY TO WEIGH PROCESS OF PICKING TREASURER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The option of making the city treasurer an elected rather than an appointed 
position is among the items scheduled for discussion when the City Council 
meets at 7 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to look at it," said Councilman Jim Potts, who requested information 
on how the city of Orange manages its financial investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The advantage of having an elected treasurer, as Orange does, is that 
additional checks and balances would be established to help guard against 
"scams and embezzlements" that have befallen cities, Potts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, a treasurer must be elected by city voters or appointed by 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin's finance director, Ronald A. Nault, was appointed by the council. 
Nault manages the city's investment portfolio of $58 million and oversees $50 
million in bond funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the council agenda tonight is the final reading of an ordinance that 
would allow Tustin voters to decide if council members should be subjected to 
term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by voters in November, the ordinance would limit council members 
to serving no more than two consecutive full terms. 
</P>
<P>
 At the June 6 council meeting, Potts and council members Michael J. Doyle and 
Tracy Worley voted in favor of the ordinance, which is aimed at preventing 
"career politicians" in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Thomas R. Saltarelli and Councilman Jeffrey Thomas voted against the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Their concern was that Tustin's clout would be diminished on county and 
regional boards that operate on a seniority system. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is also expected to consider a draft ordinance that would require 
the city's solid waste disposal contract to be put out to bid every five 
years.ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; SALE OF TWO CLOSED SCHOOLS CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Board of Trustees for the Westminster School District is considering 
whether to sell two recently closed schools and a vacant portion of a currently 
open campus. 
</P>
<P>
 At its regular meeting last week, the board heard a report from its Property 
Advisory Committee about the potential sale of Virginia K. Boos and James 
Franklin elementary schools as well as a portion of the joint Finley 
Elementary/Dr. Russell I. Johnson Middle School campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-member property committee, composed of parents, staff and community 
members, urged the district to declare all three as excess property. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the committee's plan, Boos would be sold to developers for the 
construction of single-family homes, but only if a portion is reserved as a 
park site for the community, committee spokeswoman Cathy Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee also proposed that Franklin school be retained for future use 
and be leased to generate income for the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The vacant lot adjacent to the Finley/Johnson campus should be kept for use by 
the community, especially for use by the local Little League sports program, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee made its recommendations based on enrollment estimates 
predicting modest growth for the district, which can be easily accommodated by 
remaining school sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, the money generated by the sale or lease of the properties would be 
used to pay for $31 million in renovation projects districtwide, Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board will hold a public hearing on the recommendations at its July 7 
meeting.JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; PAINTING WINS TEEN TRIP TO WASHINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For Miguel Villareal, 16, a picture is worth 2,700 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the distance between here and Washington, where he was flown last week 
to receive an award for his painting encouraging people to fight pollution and 
clean the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel, a junior at Valley High School, is one of a dozen students nationwide 
to win first place in a competition sponsored by the Washington-based Caring 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit group sponsored the "Art of Caring" contest as part of its 
program to support and encourage community and public service, said spokeswoman 
Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20,000 youngsters entered the contest, and Miguel was one of 12 
first-place winners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't describe it. It feels pretty good" to win, Miguel said before leaving 
on his trip. 
</P>
<P>
 He was especially excited to visit the nation's capital because "it's going to 
be a new experience, and I've never been traveling before." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Miguel attended an awards ceremony at the Frederick Douglass Museum 
and Hall of Fame for Caring Americans on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 His poster now hangs in the museum along with those of the other contest 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel's poster depicts a soot- and smog-covered city, with a hand wiping a 
sponge across the image to reveal bright, clean skyscrapers and deep-blue sky 
underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanying the image are the words "Don't you wish you could do this to your 
city?" 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the trip to Washington, Miguel also received a $100 savings 
bond.JON NALICK

SANTA ANA SEEKS $2.9 MILLION IN FEDERAL AID; URBAN RENEWAL: THE CITY IS 
APPLYING TO BECOME ONE OF 65 DESIGNATED 'ENTERPRISE COMMUNITIES' IN THE NATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city is applying to become one of only 65 designated urban "enterprise 
communities" nationwide under a Clinton Administration program that gives 
sweeping financial benefits to poverty-stricken areas, according to city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal -- prepared during three months of meetings with more than 150 
community organizations, businesses and governmental agencies -- has already 
been submitted to the state for preliminary review. The City Council is 
expected to endorse it at tonight's regular meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 If Santa Ana is selected, the city would receive a one-time boost of $2.9 
million to launch the project, businesses in the zone would be eligible to 
borrow money at tax-exempt rates, and all future federal funding requests for 
social service block grants would receive priority from the Clinton 
Administration, Santa Ana housing analyst Scott Kutner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The zone, based on six census tracts in the downtown core and southeastern 
part of the city, would largely overlap the city's existing state-designated 
enterprise zone, which has lured new business to the city over the past year 
with tax incentives. The council is also expected to vote tonight to expand the 
existing zone by 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something that offers tremendous potential," Councilman Miguel A. Pulido 
Jr. said of the federal proposal. "If we are selected, we'll be one of the very 
few who are fortunate to have both the state and the federal designations. But 
I think the real potential lies in additional benefits we would be able to 
realize downstream." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana is demographically the youngest city in the country, and the city's 
proposal focuses heavily on youth-oriented issues such as education, health 
care, job training, affordable housing, recreation, crime reduction and 
economic development, Kutner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given its extremely young median age and ethnically diverse demographic 
profile, the future success of the community is wholly dependent on decisions 
being made now," reads the proposal's executive summary. 
</P>
<P>
 While the zone's boundaries cover only 39,000 residents, if Santa Ana is 
designated an enterprise community, the entire city would be eligible for other 
benefits during the 10-year duration of the program, Pulido said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those include the formation of free trade "sub-zones" and preferential 
treatment in applications for federal money from the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development, as well as the Department of Labor and the Department of 
Transportation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see this as something much much greater than $3 million. Couple it with our 
position on the West Coast, our position relative to trade and our position in 
Orange County, with all these freeways that surround us . . . this designation 
would simply be something that would ice the cake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials will review the applications and forward them by June 30 to 
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. That agency is expected 
to select 65 urban and 35 rural enterprise communities by September, Kutner 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 HUD will also pick six urban and three rural areas to be "Empowerment Zones," 
entitled to more sweeping benefits than the enterprise communities. Santa Ana 
did not meet the poverty requirements to be an empowerment zone, Kutner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim has also applied for the enterprise community designation, according 
to the city's housing coordinator. The cities had to show that at least 25% of 
their populations live below the poverty line in the designated census areas, 
Kutner said. They also had to demonstrate that local agencies, businesses and 
broad-based community groups are poised to work together to solve problems of 
blight, crime, unemployment and poor health. 
</P>
<P>
 In months of meetings to develop the plan, Santa Ana sought participation from 
groups specializing in housing, health care, business, youth and public safety. 
They included church groups, the Urban League of Orange County, Civic Center 
Barrio Housing Corp., Delhi Community Center and Cambodian Family Services, as 
well as large companies and public agencies such as school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole experience has been really positive, with respect to the 
participants who were involved in the planning," said Kutner. "The city was 
very inclusive."

VALLEY CHRONICLE: PILOTING HANG GLIDERS GIVES FREQUENT FLIERS A GLOBAL OUTLOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Joe and Kris Greblo land in a foreign country, they carry no luggage. 
</P>
<P>
 When you have wings on your back, it's better that way. 
</P>
<P>
 And whether they are dropping in on Russia, China, Japan, Thailand, France, 
Norway, Brazil or Colombia, they always find fellow travelers willing to jump 
off cliffs with them at a moment's notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Piloting hang gliders has taken them over some of the most scenic locales on 
the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes when we are traveling with a group and are really organized, we 
will have a ground crew with a radio and truck follow us with our clothes and 
things," Joe Greblo, 42, says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other times we will leave our things at a hotel and head for the nearest hill 
or mountain and fly for 10 to 200 miles, depending on the air, and then circle 
back," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Kris and Joe are 20-year veterans of frequent flying. They met at the beach 
when both had on their wings. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe is part-owner of Wind Sports in Van Nuys, where he is an instructor, and 
Kris manages the office. They have been married 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of Monroe High School in North Hills, Joe learned to fly off the 
foothills in Sylmar. "Back then there was no formal instruction, so it was a 
pretty hairy thing," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I taught myself by trial and error," he adds. That was back in the 
crash-or-learn era. Now there are instructors all over Southern California, Joe 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 He became one of the country's first instructors, in the early '70s, certified 
by the newly formed United States Hang Gliding Assn. Since then, he and his two 
other instructors have taught thousands of Valley residents how to soar safely. 
</P>
<P>
 He says his operation, which offers free ground school as well as giving 
flying lessons, is more than a way to encourage the buying of equipment sold at 
Wind Sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a sport that offers so much to the flyer," he says. "But it is 
dangerous if you don't know what you are doing up there." 
</P>
<P>
 You also have to have lots of financial fuel to get going. The 25-day flight 
school costs about $1,150. To get equipped can cost between $2,000 and $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greblos fatten their coffers with flying in movies and commercials and 
doing television stunt work. They are in the upcoming Bruce Willis film, "Color 
of Night." They are also in "3 Ninjas Kick Back," helping the good guys flee 
the bad guys from the top of a skyscraper in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra income helps because Joe says glider sales have hit turbulence 
caused by the economy. Another factor is the Hula-Hoop syndrome: Today your 
sport is hot, tomorrow you are toast. 
</P>
<P>
 He says his shop and school are the oldest and largest in Los Angeles, partly 
due to attrition. "Twenty years ago there were about 25 others in our area. 
Many have shut down," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Still there are, he estimates, about 20,000 glider pilots in Southern 
California. The average age is 39, the average income is $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 He says the prototype hang-gliding pilot is a well-off engineer or computer 
programmer looking for action. "But I've taught doctors, lawyers, housewives 
and kids to fly." Horses and Dogs Part of These Wedding Planners' Circus 
</P>
<P>
 For 22 years the Calabasas Inn has been the scene of thousands of traditional 
and not-so-traditional weddings. 
</P>
<P>
 And while being a wedding coordinator means practicing discretion, the folks 
there say some of the bridal attendants have been dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Brides may choose to marry in one of the garden rooms inside the facility or 
outside on the green lawn in front of the waterfall. About 5,000 couples have 
begun their married life exchanging rings and vows here. 
</P>
<P>
 But, like other idyllic wedding spots around the Valley, this place has seen 
its share of rain delays, nervous bridegrooms and semi-hysterical mothers of 
brides. 
</P>
<P>
 It has also seen some things one wouldn't expect to see at nuptials, such as 
horse-drawn carriages, golf carts and balloon-seeking birds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try not to let anything throw us. We try to let people have the wedding of 
their dreams," says Jean Hollenstein, wedding consultant and part-owner. That 
includes having brides arrive at the scene in a horse-drawn carriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "That happens so frequently it's almost commonplace," Hollenstein says. 
</P>
<P>
 She adds that there are several local places where couples may hire a coachman 
and carriage that will bring the bride to the altar and then take the wedded 
couple for a spin. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps not so frequent an occurrence is one wedding described by another 
Calabasas Inn wedding consultant, Elissa Chenen. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Western star Monte Montana got married here, he rode his horse down the 
path to the altar and then lassoed his bride," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 One bride was so attached to her dog that she had it fitted with a pad for its 
back and put the wedding rings on it. Ergo, a ring-bearing dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Another bride was obviously trying to wedge her wedding between tee times. She 
made her triumphant entry riding in a golf cart. 
</P>
<P>
 Another couple, both of them USC graduates, insisted on honoring their alma 
mater at the ceremony and had everything done up in maroon and gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Chenen says the most common problem for people planning a wedding is trying to 
make decisions from a wide range of choices. 
</P>
<P>
 One bride, faced with a multitude of options, decided not to choose at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had everything," says Chenen, "including a harpist, bagpipers, dancers, 
horse and carriage and both a balloon release and dove release." 
</P>
<P>
 The balloon release is when dozens of helium-filled balloons rise to the 
heavens. The dove release is when dozens of little white birds fly into the 
same airspace, which to them must look like a Technicolor sky. UCLA Extension 
Offers Class in Getting People Off the Road 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Extension and the California Department of Transportation are offering a 
program for people interested in thinning out traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will not cover such innovative ideas as neutering cars so they 
don't reproduce as quickly or forcing solo drivers to traverse the freeways in 
reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 It will, however, cover ride sharing, public transportation, work-hour 
adjustment and ways to encourage folks to stay at home and use the 
communications superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of three courses leading to a certificate in Transportation Demand 
Management begins Sept. 29 at the UCLA Extension facility at Universal 
CityWalk.  
</P>
<P>
 It is meant to train people from local businesses to create programs for 
employees of their companies. Overheard: 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it my imagination or has the oil slick on Pat Riley's hair grown since 
he's been coaching in New York? Maybe the Knicks could learn the fast break if 
he used it on the soles of their sneakers instead."

NEWS ANALYSIS; CROAT-MUSLIM PACT MAY BE UNRAVELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a shotgun wedding ordered by Washington that ended the war between 
Muslims and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and three months into the marriage 
there are growing signs that it may not last. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard-line politicians seeking to undermine the Muslim-Croatian reconciliation 
are overwhelmingly outnumbered by moderates desperate for peace in both Bosnia 
and Croatia. But Croatian President Franjo Tudjman remains resistant to the 
union with Bosnia, and U.N. and European mediators are pushing a peace plan 
that the alliance has doubts about. Additionally, Croatian nationalists appear 
to be merely tolerating the pact as a means of avoiding threatened sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatian media continue to refer to Bosnian Croat separatists by titles that 
were abolished by an agreement to create a federation between Bosnian Muslims 
and Croats. And nationalist supporters of discredited rebel leader Mate Boban 
remain in their posts, still referring to him as their president and to their 
proclaimed Republic of Herzeg-Bosna. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebel patrons in the Croatian leadership here have kept alive the supply lines 
to the nationalists headquartered in Mostar and continue to coordinate military 
and political strategy with the supposedly ousted leaders of the rogue Bosnian 
Croat state. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Croat forces, known as the HVO, had been suffering tremendous 
battlefield losses in the fighting with Muslims before the federation deal was 
pressed on Zagreb and its proxies in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The yearlong war waged by Croatian nationalists to secure a Croatian ministate 
in Bosnia resulted in at least 10,000 deaths and the displacement of as many as 
300,000 Croats. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. diplomats convinced Tudjman that his country faced devastating economic 
sanctions unless it stopped backing Bosnian Croat separatism. They also 
promised reconstruction aid and investment as an inducement if Croats mended 
fences with Bosnian Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 A truce was proclaimed in late February, and an agreement creating a 
Muslim-Croatian federation in Bosnia was signed March 1. The rapprochement has 
allowed the civilian populations to restore some sense of normalcy in most 
areas the two groups share. 
</P>
<P>
 But Croatian politicians and military leaders regard the federation accord as 
either a steppingstone to a confederation with Bosnia that would be dominated 
by Zagreb or a temporary maneuver to deflect the threat of sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 When Tudjman paid his long-delayed visit to Sarajevo on Tuesday, he professed 
commitment to the new union and inaugurated a Croatian Embassy in the Bosnian 
capital. But once back on home turf, he pandered to the skeptical right wing by 
casting the visit as more gesture than genuine allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This federation agreement was signed under pressure," said Croatian 
parliamentary leader Josip Manolic, who recently broke with Tudjman's ruling 
Croatian Democratic Union, the HDZ, in protest of its Bosnian policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people still want to see the Washington agreement put into force, but a 
large segment of those in the HDZ are the ones who promoted the war option with 
the Muslims in the first place and they are undermining the agreement," Manolic 
warned. 
</P>
<P>
 A joint Muslim-Croatian army has been proclaimed by the new federal leaders of 
Bosnia, but there has been little if any evidence so far of cooperation on the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia's Muslim-led government army has fanned out across a broad and 
strategic arc in the northeast of the republic. The troops are reported to be 
preparing for a series of offensives aimed at wearing down the already 
demoralized Serbian rebels, who have a huge advantage in heavy weapons but too 
few soldiers to hold the territory they have conquered. 
</P>
<P>
 The HVO has lately allowed the government unhindered passage through areas it 
commands in central Bosnia, and the halt in Croatian-Muslim fighting has freed 
troops for the move against the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 But political and military observers here note that the HVO units in the 
nationalist heartland of Herzegovina have not lifted a finger to help their 
reputed allies wage the campaign for liberation. 
</P>
<P>
 On the contrary, they have sought to undermine the government offensive by 
stirring up fears among Bosnian Croats that their communities would be at risk 
of Serbian reprisals if they back Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 A mosque was blown up in the tense town of Vitez late last month, and U.N. 
troops have reported renewed fighting in one of the deadliest flash points of 
the Muslim-Croatian war, Gornji Vakuf. 
</P>
<P>
 When the new joint defense force mobilized troops for the northeastern 
campaign, Herzegovina forces under the command of Croatian hard-liner Gen. Ivan 
Andabak refused to join on the pretext of needing to defend the shattered 
Neretva River valley from a Serbian attack that never came, according to a 
Croatian journalist with close ties to the army. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatian military leaders decline to discuss their policy toward Bosnia with 
Western journalists, but their reluctance to give up on the idea of expanding 
Croatia is obvious in statements carried by state-run media. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Minister Gojko Susak, a Herzegovina native who directed Croatia's 
disastrous drive to conquer territory in Bosnia, told state-run television 
recently that the Washington accord was just an "interim solution." Bosnian 
Croats would never be a minority, he insisted, because Bosnia was destined to 
be part of a confederation that Croatia would dominate. 
</P>
<P>
 Susak and other hard-liners appear to be banking on eventual fulfillment of a 
secret deal to divide Bosnia that was made by Tudjman and Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tudjman still believes in a fair deal with Milosevic," said Slaven Letica, a 
political science professor at Zagreb University and a former senior adviser to 
the president. "He's not stupid, or mentally disadvantaged. . . . It's this 
phenomenon of dictators. They are seen as having all the power and being the 
force to contend with. The problem with Milosevic is he is becoming a 
self-sustaining politician." 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington agreement creating the Muslim-Croatian federation in Bosnia 
reaffirmed that national borders should not be changed by force and held out 
the prospect of Bosnian Serb areas being induced to join, effectively 
preserving the territorial integrity of Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 But observers warn that subsequent moves by U.S. and other mediators trying to 
bring peace to Bosnia threaten to abolish that principle by legitimizing the 
Serbian rebel land grab. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats from the United States, Russia and the European Union are pressing 
the federation to accept an ethnic division that would give the Muslim-Croatian 
federation sovereignty over 51% of Bosnian territory, with the rest being 
deeded to Serbs who want their own state. 
</P>
<P>
 The current focus of international mediators on forging a peace treaty dealing 
solely with Bosnia risks fracturing the tenuous alliance by leaving it too 
small and economically inviable. And the division that proposes to give the 
Serbs control over most of western Bosnia and a corridor to Serbia along the 
Sava River complicates the chances for a negotiated settlement of the frozen 
war between Serbs and Croats in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the Bosnian land that would be given to the Serbs under the 49-51 
formula abuts Serb-occupied territory in Croatia's Krajina region. 
</P>
<P>
 Western capitulation to a separate Bosnian Serb state and securing of the 
supply route for Serbian insurgents who conquered one-third of Croatia in 1991 
could encourage the rebels in this country to hold out for international 
acceptance of their own proclaimed independence. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect for a protracted standoff between Krajina rebels and the Croatian 
government is again strengthening the hand of extremists who have long warned 
that the outside world cannot be counted on to broker a just solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Moderates in the Croatian leadership, such as Foreign Minister Mate Granic, 
are viewed as sincere supporters of the Muslim-Croatian alliance. Indeed, 
Granic was one of the main forces behind the pact and reiterated his backing 
during a European Union business forum in Switzerland on Saturday when he and 
Bosnian government officials assured mediators the federation would not block 
the major powers' formula for a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 But the moderate face Croatia presents at international gatherings often 
contradicts the harder line followed in domestic politics, where ardent 
nationalists like Susak appear to have more influence with Tudjman. 
</P>
<P>
 The international community needs to tackle instability in the Balkans in a 
comprehensive manner, because the settlement of one aspect of the conflict 
risks igniting or worsening another, warned Branko Horvat of the opposition 
Croatian Social Democratic Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Splitting Bosnian territory between the Serbian rebels and the Muslim-Croat 
federation abandons a key principle of Western democracy -- that borders should 
not be changed by force. It also undermines the prospects for reuniting Croatia 
and leaves the Bosnian allies feeling duped by the federation deal, Horvat 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a classic example of how good moves by the international community 
are eventually neutralized by bad ones," he said, referring to the federation 
agreement that is slowly losing what support it had in Croatia.

IMAGE-BUILDING A GOAL OF JAPAN EMPEROR'S VISIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN MOFFAT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Emperor Hirohito and Mickey Mouse, posing side-by-side at Disneyland: The 
image was perhaps the greatest achievement of the former priest-king's first 
visit to the United States, in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some thought it undignified, the photograph conveyed just how much 
had changed in 30 years. The implacable enemy had become a friend, and the once 
awe-inspiring emperor had become the grandfatherly symbol of a country with a 
democratic constitution and a penchant for American pop culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, nearly two decades later, the late Hirohito's son, Emperor Akihito, 60, 
and his wife, Empress Michiko, 59, arrive in Los Angeles. And while they will 
not be heading to the amusement park -- Tokyo, after all, now has its own 
Disneyland -- they again will be embarking on a task of image-building. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal this time is to let Los Angeles know that the distant islands facing 
its coast are home to a people who want to be friends as well as investors and 
trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
 The eighth city on the imperial couple's 16-day American tour, Los Angeles has 
a more intense relationship with Japan than any other in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's skyline was transformed by the flow of capital from Japan in the 
1980s -- decades after fear of bombers coming from the same direction helped 
create the city's industrial might. Los Angeles is home to the largest 
concentration of Japanese Americans in the country, along with immigrants from 
China, Korea and other Asian countries who are still angry at Japan's wartime 
aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 The mix of respect and resentment, which the politically powerless but 
symbolically potent emperor gets whenever he goes abroad, shows one thing still 
hasn't changed since Hirohito's time. Japan still is the only Asian country to 
have joined the upper echelon of Western industrial nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The institution of the emperor is inescapably linked with that achievement, 
and its problems. It was the emperor, taken from seclusion in Kyoto and 
presented to the nation in a Prussian-style military uniform, that a group of 
ambitious samurai used as the symbol of Japan's 19th-Century drive to 
modernize. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the emperor that militarists used to rally their push to become a 
colonial power, and to attack the United States. It was the emperor that Gen. 
Douglas MacArthur used to represent postwar Japan's transition to democracy. 
And it is the current emperor -- a modest family man, amateur ichthyologist, 
and speaker of English -- who Japan hopes will present a friendly face to the 
world today. 
</P>
<P>
 The imperial couple has focused on meeting "ordinary people" on their trip, 
including those from many ethnic backgrounds. They dined on American-style food 
-- not French cuisine -- at the White House, visited Thomas Jefferson's home, 
called on MacArthur's widow and were scheduled to spend the night at a private 
citizen's home in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, they will have lunch with Mayor Richard Riordan and 
representatives of many ethnic communities of the city, have dinner with 650 
local notables, view the Lincoln exhibition at the Huntington Library, see 
their old friends the Reagans, visit an exhibition on Japanese immigrants in 
Little Tokyo, and visit a Japanese American retirement home. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Kawamura, an energetic 97-year-old resident of the home, said she finds 
the imperial couple appealing because of their public courtship back in the 
1950s -- on a tennis court. Kawamura, who is old enough to remember being in 
the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, recalled how her own first marriage was 
arranged, and proved less than satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different when you fall in love first and then get married," she said. 
"I'm glad their marriage was for love." 
</P>
<P>
 Empress Michiko is a commoner, she notes, and the marriages of their two sons 
to American-educated commoners has also made the emperor and empress seem less 
distant. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, 81-year-old Jack Shinagawa, born in Sacramento but raised 
until age 18 in Japan, feels no particular affection for the emperor and 
empress. He remembers when Emperor Hirohito's train passed through his town -- 
everyone had to line up and bow to it as it passed, never daring to look up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was kind of silly," Shinagawa said. "To me, (their visit) is a 
small event. I'm an American citizen." 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever the emperor goes, he is dogged by the past. The official transcribers 
of last week's White House speeches made the same slip that many almost did, 
referring to Akihito as "Emperor Hirohito." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Germany, Japan is widely seen as not facing up to its wartime past. In 
Washington and Atlanta, the emperor encountered protests by Chinese and Korean 
Americans of Japan's lack of apology for wartime aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 12, about 300 Chinese Americans, including survivors of the Nanking 
massacre, gathered in Monterey Park to protest the visit and demand war 
reparations and an apology. They plan to protest Tuesday near City Hall as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the Japanese did in Asia is . . . the forgotten holocaust," said Lang 
Yun, a Beijing-born Los Angeles resident who is helping organize the protest. 
</P>
<P>
 The most significant conflict over history in this trip was the cancellation 
of the emperor's planned stop at Pearl Harbor, which after objections by 
right-wingers in Japan was changed at the last minute to a visit to an Oahu 
cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of pressure from a tiny, sometimes-violent ultra-nationalist fringe in 
Japan, most politicians and academics still tiptoe around issues of the 
country's war guilt and the emperor's role. 
</P>
<P>
 On his American trip, the emperor has also been confronted over economic 
frictions caused by Japanese corporations and over Japanese politicians who 
have a habit of insulting American minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hosea Williams, a veteran civil rights activist, met the emperor in 
Atlanta, press reports said that Williams told the emperor "in a loud voice" 
that when he visited Japan he found "Japanese people to be very disrespectful 
of black Americans." The emperor reportedly thanked him for his "admirable 
question." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, the 125th heir to a legendary 2,600 years of the unbroken 
imperial line found himself referred to by the Washington Post as "the emp" and 
"a fish nut." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, hotel maids and busboys plan to ask for his support in a labor 
dispute at the Japanese-owned New Otani Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's kind of marching around being told by Americans that there are lots of 
things about Japan that Americans don't like. . . . I guess that's part of 
being a modern head of state," said Fred Notehelfer, history professor and 
director of the Center for Japanese Studies at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 The emperor, he noted, was educated by an American Quaker tutor. "Maybe one of 
the reasons Americans are being more open is that he projects this more open 
quality so they say things to him they would never say to the old man." 
</P>
<P>
 The emperor and empress are, of course, ordinary human beings with private 
lives. The emperor once admitted in a press conference that he occasionally 
even changed his children's diapers. Notehelfer, who played at the same tennis 
club where the then-Crown Prince and Michiko Shoda met, recalled how "he was 
very pleasant and she was a very lively and full-of-life person." 
</P>
<P>
 But they also remain the carefully managed symbols of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "One should watch with some interest how (the emperor and empress) are being 
presented," Notehelfer said. "That's what turning the emperor into a democratic 
symbol is about."

D.A. READIES FOR TACTICS OF SIMPSON DEFENSE; CRIME: GARCETTI SAYS A CLAIM OF 
MENTAL INCAPACITY WOULD NOT SURPRISE HIM. ARRAIGNMENT IS SET FOR TODAY.

 The Los Angeles County district attorney said Sunday he anticipates that O.J. 
Simpson and his attorneys likely will argue that the former football star was 
mentally incapacitated and therefore not responsible for the stabbing deaths of 
his ex-wife and a male friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wouldn't surprise me if at some point we go from, 'I didn't do it' to 'I 
did it, but I'm not responsible,' " Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said. 
</P>
<P>
 If that happens, he said, prosecutors will "be waiting" and "have no 
difficulty in overcoming that defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson met with his attorney, Robert Shapiro, at the Central Jail, but 
Shapiro declined to talk about his client's defense until after an arraignment 
scheduled for this morning in Downtown Los Angeles. Simpson was charged Friday 
in the June 12 stabbing deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 The comments from the attorneys on both sides came during another day of 
impassioned nationwide discussion and speculation about the case. Both sides 
have sought to influence public perceptions; Garcetti spent much of the weekend 
appearing on national television to focus attention on the victims, while 
Shapiro described his client's fragile mental state. 
</P>
<P>
 On his way into the Sunday visit, Shapiro told a mob of reporters that Simpson 
"wished me a happy Father's Day, and told me to spend the morning with my 
children. And then he started to cry, and said, 'I wish I could spend Father's 
Day with my children.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro also said he had delivered a "special message" to Simpson from the 
Rev. Billy Graham. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how his client will plead at the hearing, Shapiro said only that "O.J. 
will be there." 
</P>
<P>
 When told of Shapiro's comments in an interview with The Times, Garcetti 
became agitated and said "there is no doubt that the heartstrings are being 
pulled." 
</P>
<P>
 "It annoys me that we are beginning to lose focus that the true victims in 
this case are Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, their parents and the 
children of Nicole Simpson," he said. "Those are the people we should truly be 
feeling sorry for." 
</P>
<P>
 Already there has been an outpouring of public sympathy for the football Hall 
of Famer. Supporters gathered along freeways to shout encouragement to Simpson 
as he and his friend Al Cowlings, trailed by a cavalcade of police cars, made a 
suspenseful journey Friday that ended with his surrender at his Brentwood 
mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 His arrest by a police SWAT team was a spellbinding ending to a drama that 
heightened with each day. Simpson emerged as a suspect soon after the bodies of 
his ex-wife and Goldman were found late Sunday outside her Brentwood townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 By week's end, well-wishers had put signs at the mansion's gate with messages 
such as "We You O.J." "He was someone to look up to all those years," said Jeff 
Gibson, 24, of Placentia. "I just wanted to be here to show some support." 
</P>
<P>
 While in jail Simpson can read books from the library and buy newspapers and 
magazines. After his arraignment he will be allowed one visitor per day, in 
addition to his attorney and psychiatrist, Los Angeles County sheriff's 
spokesman Larry Mead said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the image of Simpson languishing in a 9-by-7-foot jail cell still sinking 
in, much of the country spent Father's Day trying to understand how he got 
there and searching for lessons to be drawn from the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson and the events leading up to his arrest were the topic of discussion 
on three major television network news programs. The drama was dissected for 
insights into the sometimes rocky relationship between Los Angeles police and 
the public; the difference between celebrities and heroes, and the mishandling 
and misunderstanding of domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have been talking about O.J. Simpson as a hero," said former Secretary 
of Education William Bennett, appearing on CBS's "Face the Nation." "I don't 
think he was a hero. We confuse real heroism with celebrity and we confuse 
celebrity . . . with significance." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the television shows also focused on the issue of domestic 
violence. Simpson pleaded no contest in 1989 to misdemeanor spousal battery of 
Nicole Brown Simpson but critics and prosecutors contend he got off too lightly 
because he avoided jail time. 
</P>
<P>
 "If O.J. Simpson had walked into his boss's office and punched him in the 
face, as he apparently did to his wife, it would not have been treated the same 
way," said U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala on "Face the 
Nation." "Violence, whether it happens in the home or outside the home, is 
sheer violence and it's unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. David Conn, who heads the special trials unit and who also 
appeared on "Face the Nation," described Nicole Simpson's slaying as a classic 
"domestic violence killing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpson case not only dominated the television networks, it also found its 
way into the pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
 During Mass at St. Martin of Tours Catholic Church in Brentwood, Nicole 
Simpson's parish, the Rev. Donie O'Ceochain said it was "almost prophetic" that 
the week's scriptural readings "deal with storm and stress, fear, anxiety, 
unanswered questions, helplessness, seeking answers and human vulnerability." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a sad week in Brentwood," he said. "We have all been touched." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brentwood townhouse where the killing occurred and Simpson's nearby 
mansion became familiar symbols of tragedy last week. Residents of the affluent 
Westside enclave tried Sunday to ease back out of the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Two police officers directed pedestrian and vehicle traffic in front of the 
townhouse as curiosity-seekers continued to converge at the site where last 
week's tragedy began. The crowds were so intense that the family living next 
door moved out temporarily to escape the attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Coe, president of the the South Brentwood Homeowners Assn., said he 
spent part of the day talking with police and traffic officials about where to 
install "no stopping," "no parking" and "tow-away" signs to discourage 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "For God's sake, people were butchered to death in there," said Philip 
Alexander, who lives about 75 yards away. "People think this is Disneyland or 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 The family of Nicole Simpson gathered at her parents' home in Dana Point for 
Father's Day. They went to brunch and then some family members went to the 
beach to relax. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just trying to have a mellow Father's Day," said Nicole's sister, 
Dominique Brown. "We're trying not to make any more comments for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, court officials made hurried preparations for Simpson's arraignment 
today. Throngs of reporters are expected to attend the court hearing, and 
officials were worried that disruptive crowds of onlookers could gather. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have very heavy security," said sheriff's spokesman Mead. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than being transported in a jail bus, the way most prisoners are, 
Simpson is to be taken alone. "Whatever route is taken to the Criminal Courts 
Building will be secret. We are not disclosing any plans," Mead said. 
</P>
<P>
 Public interest in the Simpson has been so intense that the Sheriff's 
Department set up a special address for letters to the inmate given Booking No. 
4013970: P.O. Box 86164, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti said he expects the arraignment to be continued. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Saturday that prosecutors have begun presenting evidence to a 
grand jury to win an indictment of Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti on Sunday would not deny but also would not confirm that the grand 
jury proceedings had begun. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Garcetti has said the start of a trial is at least months away, 
and he promised to make sure that Simpson is not released on bail. "He is not 
entitled to bail by law," he said. "We will do everything in our power to be 
sure that he does not have bail assigned to him." 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney conceded that the prosecution's "most profound 
challenge" will be selecting 12 jurors who will unanimously agree with the 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense is always just looking for that one juror who might hang them 
up," Garcetti said.

 "It annoys me that we are beginning to lose focus that the true victims in 
this case are Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, their parents and the 
children of Nicole Simpson," he said. "Those are the people we should truly be 
feeling sorry for." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday night, in a taped interview for ABC's "Good Morning America at Night," 
two of Nicole Brown Simpson's sisters, Dominique, 29, and Denise, 36, told of 
how the family has built a "shrine" to Nicole inside their parents' Monarch Bay 
house to help ease their grief during an emotional week. 
</P>
<P>
 They also said they are continuing to shield O.J. and Nicole Simpson's two 
children, Sydney, 9, and Justin, 6, from new reports. The children are at the 
home of their grandparents, Louis and Juditha Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they tried to put a positive light on the family's emotional state, 
Denise Brown told the show's co-host, Joan Lunden, "Joan, we're just hanging in 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 They said they decided to speak publicly as an opportunity to show their 
sister in "a different light." 
</P>
<P>
 Little was mentioned about their sister's relationship with her former 
husband, including Simpson's conviction for spousal abuse. When Lunden 
questioned them about the relationship, the sisters spoke mainly of Nicole 
Simpson's love for her children. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Monarch Bay residence of the children's grandparents, television sets 
are never turned on, to protect the children, they said. Cousins of the two 
Simpson children are nearly the same age and are ready playmates. 
</P>
<P>
 On the subject of emotion, the sisters said their father has made a special 
rule. In the mornings, they've created "hug time," an opportunity that has made 
it easier on the family, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, they've erected a shrine to their slain sister, made of pictures of 
Nicole and candles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every morning I wake up," Denise Brown said, "I go outside and light the 
candles, look at her picture . . . make some coffee and I talk to Nicole." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the public, there has been an outpouring of public sympathy for the 
football Hall of Famer. Supporters gathered along freeways to shout 
encouragement to Simpson as he and his friend Al Cowlings, trailed by a 
cavalcade of police cars, made a suspenseful journey Friday that ended with his

NORTH KOREA DRAMA HAS O.C. MARINES TALKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wherever Marines gather, from the tattoo parlors and pool halls outside Camp 
Pendleton to the quietude of their homes near El Toro, the talk has been the 
same. And it points increasingly to one thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Korea, man. Korea . . . " Lance Cpl. Thomas Babbitt, 26, stationed at Camp 
Pendleton, said last week. "That's all anyone is talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 Farther up Interstate 5, the refrain has been the same at the El Toro Marine 
base, as Leathernecks and their families contemplate the prospect of being 
deployed to South Korea amid rising fears over North Korea's suspected buildup 
of nuclear weapons, despite reports that talks are defusing the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our superiors tell us to keep the news on CNN -- just to give us a head's up 
of what's to come," Babbitt said, spitting out a chaw of tobacco. "Then, when 
we finally do get to Korea, we won't be completely in the dark." 
</P>
<P>
 They come from Columbus, Ohio; Cicero, Ill.; Blanchardville, Wis.; San Antonio 
and East Los Angeles. And as Marines, all labor under the same assumption: 
that, any week now, despite former President Jimmy Carter's claims of success 
in his diplomatic efforts, they could be ordered to get ready for deployment to 
Korea. Or, for that matter, Haiti, Bosnia, Rwanda. Or, even back to Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Escalating tensions in Haiti and North Korea have Marines and their families 
engaging far more frequently in what is rapidly becoming a daily preoccupation 
in the Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 "You find yourself watching CNN a lot more than usual and wondering what Korea 
is like," said Babbitt, who like the commander in chief who might order him 
abroad, is a native of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Marines at Camp Pendleton, El Toro and Twentynine Palms all stated 
that their superiors have been telling them that troops stationed on the East 
Coast or Guantanomo Bay in Cuba would handle any action in Haiti -- which 
military officials confirmed, adding that West Coast Marines would handle 
potential Korean duty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pride ourselves on being in a state of readiness as part of our normal 
course of business," said Col. Fred Peck, the Marine spokesman at Camp 
Pendleton. "But with Korea, we're watching and listening and preparing 
ourselves to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Peck said the growing sense of unease over North Korea's actions has the 
Marine high command "studying the common-sense military actions, which we can't 
go into. But we're pulling out all our plans and reviewing them." 
</P>
<P>
 The First Marine Expeditionary Force from Pendleton, the Third Marine Aircraft 
Wing from El Toro and the First Marine Division from Twentynine Palms would be 
involved, should deployment in Korea become necessary, Peck said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lance Cpl. Raymond Dominguez, 22, a native of East Los Angeles stationed at 
Pendleton, said North Korea is the talk of the base and of downtown Oceanside, 
where Marines have been congregating since World War II. Those serving at El 
Toro said the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's North Korea this, North Korea that," Dominguez said. "Everyone hears 
about nuclear weapons. Everyone anticipates something breaking out. They tell 
us to have our stuff half-packed, ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Fueling the anticipation is the memory of the last three years, Peck said. 
Camp Pendleton Marines have been involved in actions as diverse as the Persian 
Gulf War to helping quell the Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, there's the ever-present Cable News Network, "which has made the world 
seem so much smaller for us," Peck said. "It's always on, in all the command 
centers, the generals' offices. It's there as a constant reminder that there's 
a dangerous world out there. We watch it and wonder if we'll be called to any 
of those places." 
</P>
<P>
 It rattles the rank and file even more intensely. 
</P>
<P>
 "You find yourself watching the news and reading the paper voraciously every 
day," said Gunnery Sgt. Thomas Ciconte, 35, a native of Delaware stationed at 
El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Schumaker , 36, married to a Marine staff sergeant at El Toro, said her 
family's existence revolves around scanning the headlines and, amid bites of 
breakfast, wondering which of almost a dozen world hot spots might affect them. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as Korea goes," she said, "it's on my mind a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelli Jackson, 30, also married to an El Toro sergeant, finds herself dreading 
the prospect of another war. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been through Lebanon (the Marine occupation in the 1980s) and the Gulf 
War, so I don't want to go through any more wars," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lance Cpl. Christopher Thompson, 20, a native of San Antonio stationed at El 
Toro, hopes to be anywhere but a foreign country when the Dallas Cowboys begin 
their new season on Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it doesn't look good," he said. "We're hearing a lot about tensions in 
Korea, so that's where I'd expect to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Jonathan Ingwell, 28, a native of Blanchardville, Wis., is watching more 
and more television news, "just trying to become familiar with what's happening 
in Korea. We're kind of always prepared for something, but usually, things 
escalate more sharply." 
</P>
<P>
 Ingwell snapped his fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Persian Gulf War came up like that. This is kind of a luxury," he said. 
"At least with Korea, we're getting a strong forewarning of what might be 
ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Carmen Ingwell, 24, said any deployment is hard on a Marine family, 
but the specter of war makes it far more disturbing. As a military plane roared 
overhead, the couple's 21-month-old daughter, Devyn, cried out, "Daddy, Daddy!" 
-- immediately connecting her father to fighter jets. 
</P>
<P>
 "She knows he could be in one," her mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff Sgt. David Bell, 36, of Cicero, Ill., is educating himself about North 
Korean President Kim Il Sung, whose lack of predictability could affect Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way to prepare for Korea is one step at a time," said Bell, the

 "You learn to expect the worst," Babbitt said with a sigh. "Most of us figure

CAN REGULATING TOBACCO GET SMOKERS TO KICK THE HABIT?; HEALTH: FDA PROPOSAL 
WOULD GRADUALLY CUT CIGARETTES' NICOTINE CONTENT. CRITICS SAY PEOPLE WILL JUST 
LIGHT UP MORE.

<P>
 Imagine a society in which cigarettes are so tasteless and unappealing that 
smokers can easily quit and teen-agers may try them but will never get hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Unrealistic? Perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, such a scenario -- or a version of it -- is looming in the 
nation's not-too-distant future. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, anti-smoking forces in the federal government -- 
particularly the Food and Drug Administration, key members of Congress and the 
White House -- quietly have been building a case for the regulation of 
cigarettes. FDA officials believe they already have the authority under the 
agency's drug statutes to regulate cigarettes as drugs -- or more precisely, as 
drug delivery systems -- because of the addictive nature of nicotine. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the goal would be to help the nearly 50 million Americans already 
addicted to cigarettes kick their habit and to keep young people who experiment 
with tobacco from getting permanently hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first premise would have to be to try to not make things too tough on 
smokers," said Dr. Neal Benowitz, a professor of medicine at UC San Francisco 
who has studied the effects of nicotine on humans. "It shouldn't be a punitive 
policy but one aimed at protecting minors. There is going to be some discomfort 
for smokers, but it's worth it if it protects the next generation from getting 
addicted." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, experts insist that any war against tobacco must be a 
multi-pronged approach -- including the strict enforcement of existing laws 
against sales to minors and restrictions against smoking in public places, in 
addition to changing labeling and curbing advertising practices, particularly 
those aimed at the nation's youth. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most dramatic -- and intriguing -- proposal so far is the idea of a 
forced change in the product itself: a carefully timed lowering -- over the 
course of a decade or so -- of the allowable levels of nicotine in cigarettes 
to enable smokers to wean themselves gradually from their addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept raises some thorny questions: Will smokers consume more cigarettes 
to compensate for the decrease in nicotine? Will the cigarette industry find 
some other way -- perhaps by adding some new substance to cigarettes -- to 
maintain the demand? Will the changes turn law-abiding Americans into tobacco 
bootleggers, since full-strength cigarettes almost certainly will still be 
available outside this country? 
</P>
<P>
 Or will there come a time when Americans will look back with incredulity on a 
20th-Century society in which cigarettes were freely available and smoked by 
millions? 
</P>
<P>
 "You never know for sure, because it's never been done before," Benowitz said. 
"But I believe it can be successful, if it's real slow." 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA is in a "fact-finding mode," said Commissioner David A. Kessler, who 
is scheduled to give congressional testimony on the subject Tuesday. The agency 
is investigating both "the physiological aspects of nicotine and the extent to 
which manufacturers control or manipulate the nicotine content in cigarettes," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry officials repeatedly have denied that they deliberately increase 
nicotine levels in their products. However, they have acknowledged that 
nicotine concentrations can be adjusted through blending different tobaccos, 
and that their companies engage in this process. 
</P>
<P>
 If nicotine is addictive, as a growing body of scientific evidence indicates, 
then it could be classified as a drug under FDA statutes -- which define a drug 
as "an article, except for food, intended to affect the structure and function 
of the body" -- and it would be subject to agency regulation. The agency 
already regulates nicotine in all nicotine-containing products except 
cigarettes. Kessler refused to discuss the FDA's regulatory options at this 
time but said a realistic approach must "involve reducing demand" for 
cigarettes. An all-out ban would never work, he contends, because "prohibition 
would only result in a black market." 
</P>
<P>
 A former FDA official involved in the earliest discussions of cigarette 
regulation there predicts that one of two things will occur. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cigarette companies will try to cut a deal in which they lower their 
nicotine content and open up their plants, and we will see massive 
restructuring of how cigarettes are sold in this country," he says. "Or the 
cigarette companies will have a flock of lawyers try to block the FDA at every 
turn, and it will go all the way up to the Supreme Court to decide whether FDA 
has jurisdiction over tobacco." 
</P>
<P>
 He adds: "The agency is committed to this course now, which it has never been 
committed to before. The companies have vastly underestimated this, which has 
been a big mistake on their part." 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA has been supported in its efforts by President Clinton and key members 
of Congress who regard themselves as foes of tobacco -- including Rep. Henry A. 
Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee 
on health, who is also pushing for legislative restrictions against smoking in 
public places. It is his committee that will hear Kessler's testimony on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency also has the support of Reps. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), Mike 
Synar (D-Okla.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), all of whom are seeking measures to 
strengthen the FDA's authority to regulate tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker Merryman, vice president of the pro-industry Tobacco Institute, calls 
litigation to block the FDA "a very strong possibility" and says he anticipates 
a long battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the FDA wants to push it, we're not going to give in," he says, adding: 
"You can't have a federal agency designing a cigarette. That is a concept that 
boggles the mind." 
</P>
<P>
 He and other industry officials maintain that cigarettes are not addictive and 
that "most of the kids who experiment with cigarettes don't end up being 
smokers." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Dr. Jack Henningfield, chief of the clinical pharmacology 
research branch of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, points out that most 
adult smokers began smoking as teen-agers. He also notes that approximately 
one-third or more of smokers try to quit every year and "only about 7% make 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, he added, the 40 million Americans who have successfully stopped 
smoking represent "only 2.5% per year since 1964, which is really a lousy rate 
of spontaneous recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 Addiction experts say the only logical strategy that would help current 
smokers quit and protect future smokers from addiction is to reduce the 
dependence on nicotine by lessening or eliminating it in cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Cigarettes now on the market have five to six times the nicotine levels 
necessary to create and sustain an addiction, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of nicotine in cigarettes has remained virtually the same for more 
than 30 years, according to Henningfield. In 1952, the percentage of nicotine 
in cigarettes was about 1.5% to 1.8%. Currently, the range is 1.5% to 2.5%, he 
says. Each cigarette, regardless of whether it is a "light" or regular version, 
contains from 7 to 9 milligrams of nicotine, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The average smoker takes in a milligram or more of nicotine per cigarette, for 
a total of approximately 25 milligrams a day, according to Henningfield. 
</P>
<P>
 A smoker begins to suffer withdrawal when the accustomed level of nicotine 
drops below half, he says. For example, if a smoker is used to getting 40 
milligrams of nicotine a day, he or she will begin to experience withdrawal 
when the level reaches 20 milligrams or less, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutting nicotine levels by a small percentage over a long period of time "will 
give smokers the opportunity to learn to modify their taste and learn to smoke 
cigarettes with less nicotine," Benowitz says. "People may find cigarettes not 
satisfying anymore, and will just stop." 
</P>
<P>
 But some critics of this approach argue that smokers will only compensate by 
smoking more cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we made light cigarettes, smokers just smoked more of them," says Dr. 
Robert DuPont, the first director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse who 
now heads the Institute for Behavior and Health, a nonprofit research 
organization. "Smokers will smoke whatever it takes to get to the blood 
nicotine levels they need. The people who tell you that you can solve it this 
way are wrong. It won't work." 
</P>
<P>
 Any inclination by smokers to compensate for lower nicotine levels by smoking 
more cigarettes could indeed prove troublesome. Although the addiction to 
cigarettes stems from nicotine, the health dangers come from inhaling the smoke 
produced by burning the tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tobacco leaf is extremely toxic when burned," Henningfield says. "You can 
clean up the natural product a little bit, but you still have a highly toxic 
product. It's like the difference between falling out of a 10-story building 
instead of a 12-story building. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way you get a huge gain, if you need to keep some people on 
nicotine, is by taking away the tobacco," he adds. "Using nicotine in a 
non-tobacco product is infinitely safer than smoking a cigarette. Also, smoking 
brings out the worst in nicotine by giving you high, spiking doses that go 
directly to the left side of the heart, into the brain, and, if you're 
pregnant, to the fetus." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts acknowledge that there could be a short-term compensatory increase in 
smoking, or that smokers could puff their cigarettes more intensively. "But 
whether it will persist in the long term is unclear," Benowitz says. "There is 
some evidence that people will be smoking the same number of cigarettes that 
they smoked before, or will adjust to the lower levels of nicotine. That's why 
gradual weaning is imperative." 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA is studying the limits to which it can reduce access without 
stimulating a black market. Currently, there are restrictions on numerous 
substances -- alcohol and prescription drugs, for example -- which have not 
resulted in the development of a black market. Agency officials already have 
rejected the idea of a ban for that reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you suddenly cut yields, then the black market likelihood would be great," 
Benowitz says. "But if it's pretty slow -- a decade and a half -- and if you go 
down by 10% a year, that gives people time. And they would never notice it 
much. Also, a black market would not be necessary for kids because they are not 
smoking in the beginning for nicotine, but more for social reasons. (Now) they 
learn to smoke for nicotine over time." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, a gradual tapering over years would give existing smokers enough time to 
adjust, and nicotine in cigarettes eventually would reach a level where it 
would be difficult to initiate addiction, particularly among first-time 
smokers, experts believe. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of kids experiment with cigarettes, but the difference (with a low or 
no nicotine cigarette) would be that four or five years down the road, if they 
decided not to be a renegade, they could stop," Henningfield says. "They would 
be able to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler, the father of two young children, calls this one of his major 
motivations -- to keep today's youngsters from becoming tomorrow's smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can prevent the vast majority of teen-agers who smoke a few cigarettes 
from becoming addicted for life, then it will be an enormous public health 
achievement," he says.

U.S. SEES 'OPENING' IN N. KOREAN CRISIS; DIPLOMACY: ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL IS 
CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC ON NUCLEAR ISSUE AFTER MEETING WITH CARTER. EX-PRESIDENT 
SAYS HE EXPECTS HIGH-LEVEL TALKS TO RESUME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After weeks of escalating tensions, a North Korean offer relayed through 
former President Jimmy Carter may provide "an opening" for resolving the 
standoff over the isolated Communist nation's nuclear program, a senior Clinton 
Administration official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be an opening here" to defuse the crisis, Assistant Secretary of 
State Robert L. Gallucci said after Carter briefed top Administration officials 
on his talks in North Korea last week with Kim Il Sung, the nation's aging 
leader. Carter brought with him an offer from North Korea to freeze its nuclear 
program in return for a resumption of high-level discussions with the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerging from the Sunday morning meeting at the White House, Carter said 
flatly, "I personally believe the crisis is over, and I personally believe Kim 
Il Sung wants to be sure that the crisis is over." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter said he expects that the high-level talks -- which have been put on 
hold because of the North's refusal to allow full international inspection of 
its nuclear facilities -- could resume shortly. "I believe . . . we've reached 
complete agreement between us (the United States and North Korea) on the major 
issues," he said. "The next step would be to confirm this officially, and I 
would hope very early a third round (of direct talks) would be held." 
</P>
<P>
 Again, Administration officials were somewhat more cautious about the prospect 
of resuming talks. Gallucci said the Administration first has to confirm 
through diplomatic channels that North Korea's freeze offer meets the precise 
conditions President Clinton has set for a resumption of discussions. But 
Gallucci said the Administration will move quickly to follow up on the 
opportunity that Carter's visit created. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may well be that President Carter has brought back something upon which we 
can build and defuse the situation," Gallucci said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter met for more than two hours at the White House with Gallucci, National 
Security Adviser Anthony Lake and other officials. During the meeting, he spoke 
for half an hour on the phone with Clinton, who was spending the weekend at 
Camp David. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with CNN later Sunday afternoon, Carter said he had initiated 
the trip to the Korean peninsula out of fear that "an international 
confrontation (was) . . . inevitable" in the showdown prompted by U.S. fears 
that North Korea has been secretly developing nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter said he moved to accept a longstanding invitation to visit North Korea 
after Gallucci briefed him about the crisis two weeks ago. After the briefing, 
Carter said, he concluded that the Administration had no avenue for 
"communication with the only person in North Korea (Kim Il Sung) who could 
change the course of events." Carter said he scheduled the trip only after 
receiving approval from Clinton, who was traveling in Europe commemorating the 
50th anniversary of D-day. 
</P>
<P>
 While insisting in the interview that he did not mean to criticize Clinton's 
policies, Carter nonetheless continued to criticize the Administration's 
efforts to secure sanctions against North Korea at the United Nations. "I felt 
then and now that North Korea was not likely to (respond) to threats or 
international pressure or embarrassment or condemnation -- that the alternative 
had to be something that would let them and us save face, to let us come out of 
this in a peaceful way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter added that sanctions would have a "relatively insignificant" tangible 
impact on North Korea but "would have been, I think, the precipitation for 
possible war" by branding the North "as a criminal society." The United States 
has been discussing an escalating series of international sanctions that would 
begin with a ban on the export and import of arms and an end to U.N. technical 
assistance and could potentially build to significant economic measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter caused a diplomatic dust-up last week in North Korea when he said the 
United States was willing to suspend its pursuit of sanctions while it assessed 
the North Korean offer of a freeze; Clinton quickly and forcefully contradicted 
him Friday, insisting that efforts to impose sanctions would continue until an 
agreement is reached. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sunday, after the meeting at the White House, Carter reiterated his 
insistence that his discussions with North Korea's Kim had eliminated the need 
for the United States to continue pursuing sanctions. Reaffirming Clinton's 
Friday statement, however, Administration officials again dismissed Carter's 
remarks. Instead, they said they would continue to pursue sanctions until they 
had reached a verifiable agreement with North Korea to freeze operations at its 
nuclear plant in Yongbyon that could contribute to the manufacture of a nuclear 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, National Security Adviser Lake acknowledged Sunday that the diplomatic 
effort for multilateral sanctions could be rendered moot by the growing 
possibility of direct negotiations with the North. "If we can get into a third 
round (of talks with North Korea), the focus would shift over from the 
sanctions issues to the talks," Lake said. "And we would at that point suspend 
the effort in the (U.N.) Security Council to get sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the open differences between Clinton and the former President over 
sanctions, Gallucci insisted Sunday that "we are all on the same sheet of 
music." But he added: "I did not mean to say that everything that President 
Carter thinks and everything that President Clinton thinks are exactly the 
same. . . . I can't say to you that at every point, this Administration will 
agree with President Carter." 
</P>
<P>
 In his CNN interview, Carter said North Korea is willing both to "freeze" its 
nuclear operation and allow inspectors access to spent fuel rods recently 
removed from the Yongbyon reactor. That is considered crucial, because such 
access could be invaluable in ascertaining whether North Korea used the nuclear 
plant to make weapons-grade plutonium the last time it removed fuel from the 
reactor in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to freezing its nuclear program, Carter said, North Korea is also 
willing to discuss: joint efforts to locate military personnel still 
unaccounted for after the Korean War; massive troop reductions on both sides, 
and a pullback of troops from the tense demilitarized zone that separates North 
and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter had already revealed Saturday that North Korea's Kim had proposed an 
unprecedented summit meeting with his counterpart in the South, Kim Young Sam. 
The South Korean leader quickly accepted the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korean Prime Minister Lee Yung Duk proposed today that the deputy prime 
ministers of the two Koreas meet June 28 at the border village of Panmunjom to 
prepare for the summit. And other South Korean officials said privately that 
they hope the summit will be held around Aug. 15, Korea's Independence Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Koreas usually mark the day with pledges to unify their divided 
peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for the North Korean overtures, Carter said Sunday, Kim is seeking 
an "official declaration" from the United States that it would not use nuclear 
weapons against North Korea and aid in replacing its existing graphite nuclear 
reactors with light-water reactors that do not produce the byproducts that can 
be converted into weapons-grade fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the conciliatory words in Washington, North Korea continued its 
belligerent talk at home. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement monitored in London, the official North Korean news agency 
accused South Korea of intensifying a "war atmosphere" and making "reckless 
military provocations" by moving troops into the DMZ area.

UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES HAUNT WELFARE REFORMERS; BENEFITS: ATTEMPTS TO OVERHAUL 
PROGRAMS RESULTED IN UNEXPECTED SOCIAL PROBLEMS. CLINTON TRIES TO AVOID 
PITFALLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the federal government established its first broad public assistance 
program as part of the New Deal reforms of 1935, its authors saw it primarily 
as a way to support needy widows and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 No one could have predicted that nearly six decades later, more than half of 
the recipients would be unwed mothers, and Aid to Families With Dependent 
Children would be widely blamed for subsidizing out-of-wedlock childbirth and 
destroying families. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, when Congress created a generous medical plan for welfare families 
during the Great Society of the 1960s, no one expected that it would leave 
parents feeling trapped in the system, reluctant to take jobs for fear of 
losing their Medicaid benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 And when President Ronald Reagan tightened the rules governing the maximum 
earnings and assets that welfare recipients could have without losing their 
benefits, the last thing he wanted was to encourage welfare over work. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no greater gap between our good intentions and our misguided 
consequences than you see in the welfare system," President Clinton said as he 
introduced his welfare reform package last week in the lobby of a Kansas City, 
Mo., bank. "It started for the right purpose of helping people who fall by the 
wayside. . . . But for many, the system has worked to undermine the very values 
that people need to put themselves and their lives back on track." 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful of the lessons of the past, the Clinton Administration hopes it has 
seen the potential pitfalls clearly enough to avoid creating its own unintended 
consequences. Nonetheless, welfare specialists warn that despite their good 
intentions, the President's reformists still could produce a range of 
undesirable repercussions -- from an increase in the ranks of homeless children 
to the development of a public works program much larger and costlier than the 
Administration anticipates. 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to accurately foresee the effects of major social change when 
political concerns are forcing the policies to be put in place so rapidly, said 
Mark Greenberg, a senior attorney at the Center for Law and Public Policy. In a 
different political climate, most of the initiatives in the Administrations's 
plan probably would have been tested first, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's plan would offer welfare recipients born after 1971 a new 
deal. The government would provide job training or education to people who are 
not "job ready." But after two years, participants would have to find work in 
the private sector or spend 15 to 30 hours a week in a government-subsidized 
job. Child care would be offered as a further inducement. Those who refuse to 
participate would lose their welfare benefits entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal also would enforce laws requiring unwed mothers to identify the 
fathers of their children and would tighten child-support collection 
procedures. The reform plan also calls for a national campaign designed to 
discourage teen-age pregnancy and a new requirement that teen-age mothers live 
with a parent or guardian to qualify for government assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Democrats in Congress and liberal welfare experts believe that by cutting 
all cash assistance to parents who refuse to get jobs, the government could 
hurt children, the very people the program was created to protect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm particularly concerned about the two-year time limit," said Rep. Robert 
T. Matsui (D-Sacramento). "If it's enforced strictly, it could result in 
orphanages being set up and children being taken from their parents and put 
there or in the bankrupt foster-care system." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials argue that given the stark choice between going 
without and having to work, parents will think about what's best for their 
children and report to their jobs. But Doug Besharov, a welfare expert at the 
conservative American Enterprise Institute, said this view "seriously 
underestimates the inertia factor." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some Administration officials who worked on the plan quietly expressed 
their own worries about the time limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "My biggest fear is that the sanction gets applied quite punitively and the 
reform does not provide the help we intended it to provide, so welfare becomes 
an even more adversarial place than it is now," said one Administration 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 The time limit is not the only part of the Clinton plan that bothers experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Greenstein, executive director of the liberal Center on Budget and 
Policy Priorities, said the President's plan would turn welfare into the 
"biggest training program ever mounted," with 900,000 people in mandatory 
education and training by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 In Iowa, where a new state law requires everyone receiving welfare benefits to 
participate in education or training programs aimed at preparing them for jobs, 
local officials complain that they are quickly running out of slots. 
</P>
<P>
 Another part of the President's plan, subsidized work for those who cannot 
find positions in the private labor market, also lies in uncharted territory. 
</P>
<P>
 If states are forced to create large numbers of subsidized jobs, they could 
unintentionally drive down wages for unskilled workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole structure is untested," Greenstein said. "We really do not know 
until we try what it will work like in the real world. It would have been 
better if the Administration was proposing major demonstrations before phasing 
it in." 
</P>
<P>
 Other specialists said the states are unlikely to create enough jobs, thereby 
producing an entirely different accidental effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Creating jobs at a local level is hard work, and most states have shown very 
little interest in it," said Demetra Nightengale, a welfare expert at the Urban 
Institute, a Washington-based, nonpartisan research center. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials agree that many aspects of the Clinton-style welfare 
reform are untried, but insist that the plan is flexible enough to be adapted 
if problems arise. 
</P>
<P>
 Theda Skocpol, a Harvard University sociology professor, argues that the 
sloganeering the Administration uses will have an undesired impact of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 "The heightened rhetoric creates greater resentment when these people do not 
disappear," she said. "Welfare reform is its own biggest enemy. First there was 
the War on Poverty, now it's end welfare as we know it. The public comes to 
expect results and does not get them and then resents any attempts as wasted 
money. The rhetoric has far outrun what they are going to be able to deliver." 
</P>
<P>
 The history of welfare reform is full of examples of good intentions gone 
awry. 
</P>
<P>
 When Congress last considered welfare reform, it was inspired by a growing 
public sentiment that welfare recipients should work. But because both funding 
and follow-through were inadequate, the 1988 Family Support Act put few people 
into the work force, even though tens of thousands more welfare recipients 
entered education and training programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jobs program turned out to be more of an education program than Congress 
intended," Nightengale said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, the Ronald Reagan Administration changed AFDC rules, lowering the 
level of assets welfare recipients could possess and still qualify for AFDC. 
The percentage of AFDC families who worked dropped from 14% to 15% before 1981 
to 4% to 5% afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal at the time was to target assets to the truly needy," Greenberg 
said. "They increased the penalties on work, savings and marriage, and the 
effect of that has been to decrease the percentage of people on AFDC working at 
any time." 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives and liberals alike agree that one of the clearest unintended 
consequences of welfare policy was to encourage women to become dependent on 
the benefits and to stay that way. 
</P>
<P>
 The current caseload has hit a record 14.3 million, with more than 30% of 
recipients remaining on the rolls for eight years. One in seven children 
benefits from AFDC. A key reason for that dependency, according to the 
President and many welfare experts, is that the program, especially its medical 
benefits, is so attractive that many recipients feel that they will lose by 
taking low-paying jobs that often do not include medical benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton highlighted this dilemma in his Kansas City speech: "Today you have 
this bizarre situation where people on welfare, if they take a job in a place 
which doesn't offer health insurance, are asked to give up their children's 
health care and go to work, earning money, paying taxes, to pay for the health 
care of the children of people who didn't make the decision to go to work and 
stayed on welfare. . . . That does not make sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Even worse than encouraging dependency, some conservative welfare specialists 
argue, AFDC has encouraged out-of-wedlock births by enabling young women with 
children to set up housekeeping. They note that the proportion of never-married 
women on AFDC has grown from 21% in 1976 to 52% in 1992. Now, 30% of all babies 
are born to unwed mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 The system also makes it difficult for two-parent families to qualify for aid. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, it has taken poor women out of the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 "It almost forced poor women to stay out of the work force while their 
middle-class and upper-middle-class sisters were entering the work force," said 
Barbara Blum, president of the Foundation for Child Development, a former 
welfare administrator for New York State and past president of the American 
Public Welfare Assn. "We were paying women to be at home with their children. 
It did not reflect what was going on around them."

SIMPSON CASE COMPELS NATION TO LOOK AT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. La GANGA and ELIZABETH MEHREN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First came Betty Ford, who spoke of alcoholism and drug abuse, breast cancer 
and radical mastectomies. Then there was Rock Hudson, whose 1985 death landed 
AIDS on Page 1. Anita Hill was next, our professor on sexual harassment, how 
complicated it is and how little acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 And now there is the case of O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 As he sits under suicide watch in a tiny Los Angeles jail cell, charged with 
the murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Lyle 
Goldman, the football star turned commentator joins the pantheon of famous -- 
if sometimes unwilling -- professors on delicate subjects, this time domestic 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 From newspapers to talk shows, offices to neighborhood bars, domestic violence 
was the issue of the week after a double murder and a celebrity arrest. 
Although 4 million women suffered some form of battering by husband or lover in 
1993, it is this woman, Nicole Brown Simpson, and this man, Orenthal James 
Simpson, who have made us talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the story evolves, I think all of us are going to get educated on domestic 
violence," said Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, on the 
Sunday morning talk show "Face the Nation." "It's our dirty little secret. This 
is the leading cause of injury among women in our society." 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation of Nicole Simpson's slaying has brought to light her long 
and turbulent relationship with Simpson -- one that is now being deconstructed 
nationwide. There are police reports, a 1989 conviction for spousal battery, 
interviews with neighbors, a desperate letter read on national television. 
</P>
<P>
 To a country that does not face its problems until forced to take stock by 
dramatic events, this latest primer in human behavior is a stark and painful 
unveiling of yet another former taboo subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the past seven years, the surgeon general has been telling us that 
domestic violence is a leading cause of injury to women in this country," said 
Stacey Kabat, of the Boston-based group Battered Women Fighting Back and a 
co-producer of the 1993 Academy Award-winning film "Defending Our Lives." "Hey 
everybody, this is nothing new." 
</P>
<P>
 That is just the point made by Dr. Alvin Poussaint of the Harvard Medical 
School on "Face the Nation" Sunday morning. As with child abuse in the 1960s, 
he said, this country has ignored domestic violence because it is a "family 
affair," largely played out on a very private stage. 
</P>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson told police just that on New Year's Day in 1989, when he beat, 
punched and kicked his wife so severely that she required treatment at a 
hospital. He later pleaded no contest to misdemeanor spousal battery charges, 
served no jail time and was allowed to be treated by a psychiatrist of his 
choice over the phone rather than undergoing a yearlong counseling program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police have been out here eight times before, and now you're going to 
arrest me for this?" Simpson yelled that night to two police officers 
responding to a 911 call, according to documents released by the city. "This is 
a family matter, why do you want to make a big deal out of it when we can 
handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 Five years later, Simpson had not changed his mind. In a letter written Friday 
and read by a friend on national television while he was running from police, 
Simpson said he "took the heat New Year's 1989 because that's what I was 
supposed to do. I did not plead no contest for any other reason but to protect 
our privacy." 
</P>
<P>
 To psychotherapist Ellen Ledley, who specializes in domestic violence issues, 
that comment shows Simpson's complete denial that any problem existed in his 
marriage. "The problem with most men who batter is that they use denial, 
avoidance, minimizing, that it's just between us." 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter, which was written Friday just before he fled from police and 
began "To whom it may concern," Simpson also said he felt "like a battered 
husband or boyfriend," and that what he and his wife went through was "no more 
than every long-term relationship experiences." Domestic violence counselors 
report that most batterers do feel victimized, that somehow they are the ones 
suffering abuse and that by their actions they are getting back at their wife 
or partner. 
</P>
<P>
 "The letter was so confused," Ledley said. "It had a really deranged feel to 
it. He's denying (the abuse) on one hand and proving it on the other by 
everything he says." 
</P>
<P>
 What makes those who counsel battered women most angry about the Simpson 
domestic violence case are the breaks that they say O.J. Simpson received 
because of his celebrity. But they are the first to admit that less famous 
sometimes men get off easy in a system that often does not protect battered 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you live in a nice area, if you have social status, are a doctor, a 
lawyer, a politician, that helps you get preferential treatment," said Ellen 
Okamoto, community education coordinator for the Los Angeles Commission on 
Assaults Against Women. "On the other hand, if you have a criminal record or 
your neighborhood isn't so nice . . . it's more likely you won't get treated as 
well. You may go to jail for a few hours. Still it's not pursued either way." 
</P>
<P>
 Although men are by no means immune to the most extreme act of domestic 
violence -- murder -- women are far more likely to be killed by someone they 
love. Figures from the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence in 
Washington show that among murder victims in 1993, women were four times as 
likely as men to be killed by spouses or other partners. Los Angeles County 
Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti contends that one woman is killed in Los Angeles 
County every nine days in an episode of domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to focus on the issue of domestic violence," said Garcetti, who has 
made the rounds of television talk shows to discuss spousal abuse and the 
Simpson case. "Our goal is to stop the violence. . . . It should not matter if 
the batterer is a celebrity or Joe Jones from down the street." 
</P>
<P>
 The most lethal time in any abusive relationship is when the battered partner, 
usually the woman, decides to leave. "In terms of being murdered, that is the 
time at which they are particularly vulnerable, when they say, 'I've had enough 
of this garbage,' " said William Samek, a Miami psychologist who is director of 
the Florida Sexual Abuse Treatment Program. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the lessons that O.J. Simpson is teaching the nation this week: Why 
men abuse and why women stay, and why it hurts so much to everyone involved in 
an abusive relationship. He is in good company, for most such difficult lessons 
these days are not learned without celebrity assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Nice people didn't use drugs until Betty Ford said they did. She knew 
firsthand; she was hospitalized in 1978 for a dependency so serious that it 
"was really sort of miraculous that I survived it," she later said. Ford also 
went to great lengths to publicize the threat of breast cancer after her 
radical mastectomy in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 "Betty Ford got cancer, and everyone went out and got mammograms," said 
filmmaker Margaret Lazarus, a veteran of women's causes and a co-producer of 
"Defending our Lives." 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS wasn't an "epidemic" until Rock Hudson died. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual harassment only happened to "other people" until Anita Hill accused 
Judge Clarence Thomas of it after he was nominated for the Supreme Court in 
1991, Lazarus says. "We are about to witness a national debate about how 
seriously we take cases of sexual harassment in 1991," said Susan Estrich, a 
USC law professor, as the Hill-Thomas case unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes celebrity lessons backfire. Consider Mike Tyson, now serving a 
prison sentence in the 1991 rape of Desiree Washington, a Miss Black America 
contestant. 
</P>
<P>
 Okamoto, of the Commission on Assaults Against Women, spends a lot of time 
teaching high school students about rape, what it is and what it isn't. Most 
students understand -- until the Tyson case comes up. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say, 'Mike Tyson and Desiree, well, she invited him in,' " Okamoto 
recounts. "You're taking down a hero, and that's big time."

PHILIP MORRIS CEO QUITS; 2 OFFICERS TO SPLIT HIS DUTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The head of Philip Morris Cos. abruptly quit over the weekend in a stunning 
shake-up at the nation's biggest tobacco concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman and Chief Executive Michael A. Miles, a veteran of the company's food 
business who has been criticized by tobacco partisans for being unresponsive to 
attacks on the cigarette industry, is being replaced by two executives with 
long experience on the tobacco side of the business. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes at the helm of New York-based Philip Morris come as the entire 
U.S. tobacco industry is reeling from assaults by politicians and anti-smoking 
activists. Tobacco company profits also have suffered until recently from a 
price war fueled by Philip Morris last year when it slashed the price of its 
Marlboro cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the shake-up at Philip Morris favors the tobacco side of the company 
over its vast food and beer operations, which include Kraft General Foods and 
Miller Brewing Co. Miles, 54, who is stepping down after nearly three years as 
the head of Philip Morris, was the first nonsmoker to run the company and was 
Kraft's chief executive when the food processing giant was acquired by the 
tobacco concern in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Miles' replacements -- R. William Murray, 58, and Geoffrey C. 
Bible, 56 -- are both longtime tobacco executives, with a combined 50 years of 
experience at Philip Morris. Murray, Philip Morris' president and chief 
operating officer until he was named vice chairman for food last month, now 
becomes chairman of the entire company. 
</P>
<P>
 Bible, who had been vice chairman of tobacco, was elevated to president and 
chief executive of the entire company. Although the title of CEO would suggest 
that Bible is now the most powerful executive at Philip Morris, a company 
spokesman said that he will report to Murray. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter of resignation submitted late Friday but not disclosed by Philip 
Morris until Sunday, Miles said he is leaving with "full confidence" that the 
decisions made during his tenure "will be proven right by our results in 1994 
and beyond." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, however, with the resurgence of our U.S. tobacco business and the 
continued strong growth in international tobacco, it makes sense to again have 
a career Philip Morris executive in the top job," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Miles nor his successors could be reached for comment. Spokesmen for 
the company said Miles was not pressured to leave, but he is widely believed to 
have run into strong opposition from other directors and major investors. 
</P>
<P>
 His main nemesis may have been Philip Morris' former chairman, Hamish Maxwell, 
who is said to have plunged back into the company's operations recently. When a 
proposal believed to have been pushed by Miles to split Philip Morris' tobacco 
and food operations was considered by the board last month, Maxwell is believed 
to have played a strong role in shooting it down. Splitting the company had 
many fans on Wall Street, where the investment community hoped such a move 
would both yield greater value for shareholders and insulate a separate food 
business from tobacco liability. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris stock is one of America's most widely held and is included in 
many pension funds. The company's shares climbed from about $80 when Miles took 
over in September, 1991, to a high of just over $86 a year later, but they have 
plunged since -- they closed at $50.375 on Friday -- costing investors more 
than $30 billion since 1992. Industrywide turmoil gets much of the blame, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall value of the company on Wall Street fell by nearly $13 billion one 
day last year, after investors were caught off guard by an announcement that 
the company was slashing premium cigarette prices to stave off competition from 
cheaper brands. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Miles' departure does not appear to be directly related to rising 
protests by anti-smoking activists, he is believed to have frustrated those 
close to the company with his barely visible profile in the current national 
debate. Miles rarely gives interviews to the news media or speaks before Wall 
Street analysts who follow the company's stock. 
</P>
<P>
 But John C. Maxwell Jr., an analyst with Wheat First Securities in Richmond, 
Va., said he believes the company is positioned to do well in coming years -- 
unless substantial new taxes or other strong regulatory controls are placed on 
tobacco sales.

LOMPOC MAN, 72, APPARENTLY WINS $50.4 MILLION IN LOTTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 72-year-old Lompoc aerospace technician is the apparent winner of the 
state's estimated $50.4-million Super Lotto jackpot, making him the largest 
winner in California lottery history. 
</P>
<P>
 The clerk at a 7-Eleven store in the coastal community -- earlier identified 
by lottery officials as the location that sold the winning ticket -- said 
Sunday that the lucky customer was Augustine Chiarenza, who is married but has 
no children. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, at the moment a reporter called late Sunday, Chiarenza was in the 
store reading off the numbers on the ticket he bought several days ago: "6, 11, 
26, 27, 38, 50." 
</P>
<P>
 Chiarenza was not even aware of how much he'd won until told by the reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eeesch!" he said. "I didn't know that. I knew it was large." 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll hit me," he added. "I'm still in a state of shock. I haven't quite 
broken the news to my wife yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Chiarenza said he planned to go to a lottery office in Ventura today to claim 
his prize. Lottery officials said they will not confirm the winner's name until 
the ticket is delivered. The prize -- with federal taxes taken out -- will be 
paid over a 20-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest previous California winner was Thomas Tehee of Upland, who won a 
$45.3-million jackpot on Dec. 5, 1990, lottery spokeswoman Norma Minas said. 
Though other jackpots have been higher, there have been several winning 
tickets, meaning that the prize was split. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely, this would break the record for a single ticket," Minas said. 
</P>
<P>
 About $100 million worth of tickets were sold before Saturday's drawing. But 
Chiarenza said he missed it on TV: He had to put in a 13-hour shift at Martin 
Marietta's facility at Vandenberg Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent much of Sunday working as well. It was only during a morning coffee 
break that he checked the numbers in the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't sink in," he said. "I wanted to check it out at the store." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he didn't want to leave work because his employer would have had to 
call in a replacement. So he waited until his shift ended at 4 p.m. before 
going to the 7-Eleven to confirm the numbers that he didn't even pick himself 
-- they were spit out on a Quick Pick ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a miracle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiarenza said he is not quite sure what he will do with the money, but he 
plans to pay off the $129,000 home that he bought six months ago with his wife, 
Marguerite. He also wants to pay off the loan on his 1988 Lincoln Mark VII. 
</P>
<P>
 He has no immediate plans to quit the job that he's held for 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm already past retirement age," he said. "When you retire, you have to have 
something to do. I don't really have that many hobbies and I don't play that 
many sports." 
</P>
<P>
 At the 7-Eleven, Chiarenza was posing for pictures for a local newspaper 
photographer, but had yet to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long day," he said. "I'm going to take a shower, get a bite to 
eat. Maybe I'll go to the Elks Club."

KING'S RANSOM; COLLECTORS PAY TOP DOLLAR FOR ELVIS ARTIFACTS AT MAJOR LAS VEGAS 
AUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The King is dead, long live His Stuff! 
</P>
<P>
 A computer chip manufacturer paid $320,500 this weekend for Elvis Presley's 
stretch Mercedes-Benz limousine -- after having deposited $1 million with the 
auction house in case the bidding went that high. 
</P>
<P>
 Others paid $68,500 for Elvis' royal blue, silver-studded performance 
jumpsuit. And $2,070 for Elvis' navy blue denim swim trunks (size 38 waist), 
and $1,035 for a stained, diagonally striped, white-gray-and-black tie that the 
King had worn and slopped on, and $34,500 for Elvis' personal, Giannini 
acoustic guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 His pajama bottoms went for $2,250, his comb for $950 and his gold necklace, 
with trademark TCB (Taking Care of Business) logo and lightning bolt, for 
$55,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But for just $425, Pat and Michele Vodrey of Garden Grove successfully bid on 
exactly what they came for, and could afford: three Elvis 45s on the Sun label, 
including a prized, blue vinyl copy of "Hound Dog" with "I Want You, I Need 
You, I Love You" on the flip side. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love Elvis!" Michele gushed as she paid the cashier. "We're going to get 
rid of the family portrait and hang these right over the couch." 
</P>
<P>
 And so it went Saturday and Sunday at the Las Vegas Hilton, an old Elvis haunt 
where the largest assemblage ever of the rock 'n' roll icon's personal articles 
and career artifacts went on the auction block, teasing small fans and major 
collectors alike from throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Hammond was dispatched from Boston by his wife, who was unable to 
travel. But as the editor of an Elvis Presley fan club newsletter, she wanted 
to get in on the action. "See everything (in the auction catalogue) marked with 
an X? Those are all the things she wants," Hammond said. "My wife, she's an 
extreme fool." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite concerns that he couldn't afford anything, by Sunday night Hammond had 
two items to take home: a gold medal identification card once carried by an 
Elvis aide ($600), and a tiny piece of gold bedroom carpeting ($300). 
</P>
<P>
 Though he was confident that his wife would view them as prizes, Hammond made 
clear where he stood. "At that price, I think it comes out to $15,000 per 
square yard," he said. "I feel like a jackass." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Bergstrom, who came from Chicago, was the elated buyer of a gilt-metal 
inkstand-penholder that Elvis used as a pipe stand. Its value was estimated at 
$150 in the auction catalogue; her winning bid was $1,400. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll keep it in my bedroom," she said. "Aside from the bedroom set, it'll be 
the most expensive thing in there. My husband's going to freak, but he owes it 
to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle DeMoss came from Northridge, to restart an Elvis collection that was 
destroyed in the January earthquake. She got $2,500 from her insurance company 
for the lost Elvis collectibles -- and used it to buy a 45 record autographed 
by Elvis ($1,400), a set of Elvis pencils and a pen ($150) and a black ceramic 
ashtray ($1,100) used in an upstairs office at Graceland, Elvis' Memphis 
mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got better stuff now than I did before the earthquake," DeMoss cooed. 
"These are things he actually owned or autographed." 
</P>
<P>
 Radio station owner Dave Schnehrer flew out from Flint, Mich. to buy Elvis' 
sunglasses. They cost him $3,100. "I think they were the ones Elvis was wearing 
in the last photograph ever taken of him," he said. "I hope nobody sits on 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Author Patricia Jobe Pierce snatched up two of Elvis' rings for about $10,000. 
The one with the tiger eye setting, she said, "is his essence." 
</P>
<P>
 After paying for them, she immediately put them on her fingers. "They fit!" 
she proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 people bid on the collection, said Pamela Tapp, spokeswoman 
for Butterfield & Butterfield, the Los Angeles auction house that staged the 
event. About half of the participants attended the auction here, where Elvis 
performed between 1969 and 1976 before 2 1/2 million fans. Another 500 or so 
people -- many from overseas and reportedly including Ringo Starr -- bid 
through telephone banks operated in Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The unloading of the Elvis collectibles was a bittersweet experience for Jimmy 
Velvet, the 1950s songwriter and singer who befriended Elvis in 1956. Velvet 
opened his Elvis Presley Museum in 1978, the year after the King died. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years Velvet had acquired about 800 Elvis collectibles from members 
of Presley's family and entourage. Since he has opened other celebrity-item 
museums, Velvet decided to keep his 200 favorite Elvis items and sell the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 By Sunday evening, 560 items had sold, bringing Velvet $2 million and change 
in gross sales. 
</P>

 The highest-ticket item: the 1969 Mercedes-Benz six-door Pullman limousine, 
which Presley rented once while on tour, fell in love with and insisted on 
buying. His former road manager, Joe Esposito -- who attended the auction for 
old time's sake -- said Elvis paid about $40,000 for the vehicle, after 
promising the limo company that it could still use the Mercedes when he wasn't 
in town. But Elvis reneged on his promise and kept the limo for himself, 
Esposito said. 
</P>
<P>
 Car collector Edward Arnold, chairman and chief executive officer of 
Integrated Circuit Systems, came to Las Vegas from Valley Forge, Pa., intent on 
buying the vehicle. And he did. 
</P>
<P>
 No one topped his last bid of $290,000 -- on which another 15% was added for 
the auction house's piece of the action. "It's a thrill, guys, I swear!" Arnold 
bubbled after the auction hammer was banged down. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the room, Jimmy Velvet could only wonder how much more 
money he could have made. "I knew he had deposited a million dollars to buy the 
car. He got it for a steal. I could have had someone bid against him (to drive 
the price up) but that wouldn't have been right. I feel like I lost $700,000." 
</P>
<P>
 But Arnold found a way to spend his savings; later he bought Elvis' 1977 
Cadillac Seville -- driven by Elvis the day before he died -- with a $90,000 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
 For every millionaire in the crowd, there was an Elvis impersonator -- or, 
more accurately, an impersonator of an Elvis impersonator. Johnny Wentzel -- 
wearing a macrame rope belt, white jumpsuit and bushy sideburns -- paced the 
auction floor, hoping to find an affordable Elvis jumpsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I make my own jumpsuits -- you can't tell the difference between mine and 
Elvis' -- but I want one of his to use as a pattern," Wentzel said. "There are 
30 to 40 working Elvis impersonators in town, you know." And their waist sizes 
range from 30 inches to 40 inches, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 While some Elvis collectors clearly came here to purchase specific items, 
others were caught up in the moment. John Corbett, one of the stars of the 
popular television series "Northern Exposure," showed up at the auction out of 
curiosity and ended up successfully bidding $36,000 for Elvis' American Express 
card and $60,000 for Elvis' birth record document. 
</P>
<P>
 "The spirit of Elvis must have jumped in me," Corbett said afterward. "Until 
now, the only Elvis things I had was one of his Christmas albums and his 'Aloha 
from Hawaii' -- via satellite -- tape. But I love Elvis." 
</P>
<P>
 Corbett said he wouldn't leave home without Elvis' American Express card.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: THE NOT-SO FAVORITE SON OF SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's likely a first: A politician wins a statewide election, but is rejected 
by the people who presumably know him best -- the voters of his own community. 
</P>
<P>
 Amazed, I came to Santa Barbara to ask why Rep. Michael Huffington couldn't 
carry his own county while capturing the Republican U.S. Senate nomination by a 
landslide margin of 26 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 The super-rich rookie congressman -- dubbed "Perot by the Sea" -- lost by two 
points in Santa Barbara County to a hard-line conservative from Orange County, 
former Rep. William Dannemeyer. 
</P>
<P>
 I quickly learned that the result had much less to do with Dannemeyer than 
with former Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino, the veteran Republican officeholder and 
local native whom Huffington had beaten in 1992 soon after moving here with his 
many millions from Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican party locally is still deeply split over Huffington's 
fratricidal ousting of Lagomarsino. And the schism only widened when the newly 
elected representative announced just eight months after taking office that he 
would leave the seat to run for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "That didn't set well," noted Mabel Shults, a Santa Barbara party activist and 
hotel designer. "He's been working politically for himself instead of this 
area." 
</P>
<P>
 Asserted Barney Klinger, a manufacturer and major GOP fund-raiser: "He's not 
only done nothing as a congressman, he lied. He said he'd stay in the office 
for three (two-year) terms." 
</P>
<P>
 Klinger now is organizing a $500,000 fund-raiser for Huffington's Democratic 
opponent, Sen. Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To get Huffington's side, I went to his local congressional office -- in one 
of those typical light stucco buildings with a red-tile roof -- and began 
asking questions. You'd have thought I had a contagious disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll have to call the campaign office," I was told. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd already called and was told by the candidate's state campaign manager, Bob 
Schuman, that "it's not a big deal" because Santa Barbarans also had rejected 
Huffington in the 1992 primary; he'd made up for it by carrying adjacent San 
Luis Obispo County. "There's still some residual Lagomarsino loyalty. That's 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 But Huffington has been representing Santa Barbara in Congress since the last 
election and should have been able to build up his support. I wanted to know 
what he'd done for the county. "We don't have that," said his district 
representative, Angeles Perez. 
</P>
<P>
 How about the name of a supporter I could talk to? Another aide pointed to a 
woman in a chair and said she was a local GOP official. I asked the woman if I 
could talk to her. She ducked out the door and sped off in her car. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez wrote down the phone number of another woman but wouldn't let me call 
her from the office. That would be mixing politics with congressional business, 
she said. "There's probably a pay phone somewhere on State Street." 
</P>
<P>
 I found one and called Marian Koonce, who owns rental properties and once 
backed Lagomarsino but switched to Huffington in 1992. "I see Michael as a 
shining star, a comer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what Huffington had done for the county, Koonce told me of a case where 
he had helped obtain a green card for the daughter of one of her tenants, an 
immigrant farmer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Koonce herself brought up probably the most controversial case involving 
Huffington -- his refusal to help Raytheon Corp., one of Santa Barbara's 
biggest employers, obtain State Department permission to sell $100 million 
worth of shipboard missile defense systems to Taiwan. "He has an aversion to 
helping companies with armaments," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Astonished, Raytheon turned to Feinstein, who quickly went to bat for the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington later explained to a Times reporter, "I'm not going to be a paid or 
unpaid lobbyist for any company. That's not my job. I represent everyone 
equally." 
</P>
<P>
 That clearly is a new concept in representing your constituents in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington likes to say he is not "beholden" to any special interest because 
he refuses PAC contributions. With an oil fortune estimated at $70 million, he 
can afford to finance his own campaigns and does -- spending $5.2 million to 
win the House seat and expecting to write checks for at least $15 million in 
this Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
 I drove down the coast, past Montecito where Huffington has his $4.3-million 
mansion, all the way to Solimar near Ventura. There, I found Lagomarsino at his 
beach house. 
</P>
<P>
 He's now 67, tanned and relaxed -- but still bitter. Recently, he handed over 
to the Feinstein campaign two boxes of Huffington research material. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's race could be a classic: Can a rich newcomer with almost no 
political base or record buy himself a U.S. Senate seat?

RWANDAN FIGHTING FLARES; PARIS READY TO SEND TROOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAMB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Heavy fighting erupted again Sunday in the Rwandan capital of Kigali as rebel 
forces tried for a decisive victory before the possible intervention of foreign 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. spokesman said by phone that the dug-in government troops and the 
advancing Rwandan Patriotic Front rebels, who already control more than half 
the country, exchanged mortar, artillery and small-arms fire throughout much of 
the day. The continuing battles have turned Kigali into a virtual ghost town. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's fighting came a day after French President Francois Mitterrand said 
that his country was prepared to send 2,000 troops to Rwanda on a humanitarian 
mission to stop the massacre of civilians. He said they could arrive in Kigali 
in a matter of days and indicated that France was willing to go it alone if no 
other Western nations joined the force. 
</P>
<P>
 France will seek approval for intervention in a resolution to be introduced to 
the U.N. Security Council this week, Reuters reported from New York. France 
needs authorization for the mission because of the presence of 450 U.N. troops 
already in Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far, France's promised involvement has not received widespread support. 
Italy apparently is the only other European nation considering sending troops, 
although several countries, including the United States and Belgium, the former 
colonial power in Rwanda, have said they might provide logistic and 
transportation support. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations recently approved sending an additional 5,500 troops to 
Kigali to create "safe zones." Senegal, Zaire and Ethiopia have said they would 
contribute to the force, whose mission would be to protect civilians but not 
intervene in the fighting between the Hutu-dominated army and the mostly Tutsi 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 Western diplomats in Nairobi fear that any U.N. effort could become bogged 
down like the U.N. humanitarian mission in Somalia. Additionally, they say, the 
expedition could be particularly risky for France. 
</P>
<P>
 France once armed and trained the Rwandan military and is despised by the 
Hutus, who felt betrayed when France and Belgium ended their presence in Kigali 
last April. On the other hand, the Tutsi rebels see France as being sympathetic 
to the Hutus and have said a French military presence is unacceptable. Uganda, 
the rebels' main supporter, has also voiced opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 But without outside intervention, it increasingly looks like Rwanda's 
3-year-old civil war could drag on, as have wars in Angola and Liberia. Both 
sides have so far proved themselves unable to provide unity, security or 
protection to the Rwandan people. 
</P>
<P>
 What started as a war of liberation when the rebels invaded Rwanda from Uganda 
in 1991 has now taken on the appearance of a tribal vendetta. Both sides have 
ignored a truce agreed to last week at the Organization of African Unity summit 
in Tunis, Tunisia. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the rebels succeed in taking Rwanda, political analysts wonder what 
they would do with it. As only a small minority in Rwanda, the Tutsis are not 
strong enough politically to run the country, African diplomats said, and there 
is concern that so much hatred now exists between the Tutsis and Hutus that the 
two sides will be carrying out revenge attacks against each other for years.

POLICE FEAR MORE KILLINGS AFTER 6 SLAIN IN ULSTER PUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police in Northern Ireland warned of another round of sectarian killings after 
six Catholics were slain by gunmen while watching Ireland's World Cup soccer 
match on television in a pub late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in the middle of a series of tit-for-tat killings," Deputy Chief 
Constable Blair Wallace of the Royal Ulster Constabulary said Sunday. "They 
started on Thursday and Friday, and this was undoubtedly one of that series." 
</P>
<P>
 He said police had been on alert over the weekend but that it was impossible 
to determine exactly where the killers would strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ulster Volunteer Force, an outlawed Protestant Unionist paramilitary 
group, claimed responsibility for the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is quite clear each of the terrorist groups are endeavoring to outdo the 
other in the enormity of their blood lust," Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds, who had celebrated Ireland's unexpected 
1-0 victory over Italy, said Sunday that the pub attack was a "slaughter of the 
innocents." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Mayhew, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, denounced the attack as 
"inhuman savagery." The shootings occurred at O'Toole's bar in the isolated 
village of Loughinisland in County Down south of Belfast. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said two men entered the pub and began shooting, hitting 11 of the 
24 people in the bar. Six died, and five who were wounded were in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Local villagers expressed shock and anger that the paramilitary group would 
attack the Catholic-owned pub, which was known to have a friendly atmosphere 
and also attracted Protestant drinkers. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Chief Constable Wallace warned that more attacks could follow because 
the World Cup contests are expected to draw large television-viewing crowds, 
presenting many targets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have specific concerns about a number of events where people are likely to 
congregate in numbers in specific places," he said, "including, obviously, pubs 
during the World Cup matches." 
</P>
<P>
 The pub attack followed another upsurge in violence in the province during 
which four people were slain in 24 hours.

AMERICAN ALBUM: TOURISTS RUNNING ROUGHSHOD OVER UTAH TOWN; HORDES OF MOUNTAIN 
BIKERS SEEKING THRILLS ON DESERT TRAILS BRING POLLUTION PROBLEMS TO MOAB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A college student pops a reggae tape into the dash of his pickup truck, parked 
near a lone pinyon tree. Surrounding him on a bluff high above town are 
hundreds of brightly colored tents, more pickups and more people. 
</P>
<P>
 They are here on a warm spring weekend to ride mountain bikes on the famed 
Slickrock trail, rated "gonzo-abusive" by a local bike shop. The fat-tire 
wayfarers bring with them food and beer, dogs and toilet paper. The latter lies 
crumpled in trees, twigs and sand throughout the desert campsites. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, this busted uranium town in southeastern Utah desperately 
sought tourism. Now, faced with rowdy crowds and a deteriorating landscape, 
many of Moab's townspeople wish it weren't quite so popular. "It's a circus," 
says Bill Hedden, a Grand County councilman. "Hordes of people are hanging off 
walls, swinging from rocks." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're overwhelmed," agrees Russ von Koch, one of only seven recreation 
planners overseeing 6 million acres for the federal Bureau of Land Management 
in southern Utah, who says the habitat is being destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, between 1 million and 2 million visitors came to Moab, population 
5,000. Many tour nearby Arches and Canyonlands national parks; others prefer to 
experience the vast desert on bicycles, in helicopters or in four-wheel- drive 
vehicles. Most of the springtime revelers camp out on the public land around 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 "During spring break last year, we had riots," Von Koch says. "There was a lot 
of underage drinking, with up to 500 people in one small site, starting 
bonfires, burning trees. Now we're starting to regulate it more. We want to 
keep the number of campers per site below critical party mass." 
</P>
<P>
 But the agency can barely keep up. Despite 55 new campsites with toilets, 
there's never enough for the tourists, whose numbers increased 34% last year. 
Along the Colorado River, cottonwood groves yield the stench of human waste and 
garbage accumulated over a season of weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, environmentalists worried about cows, strip mines and large 
dams. Now, says Scott Groene of the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, they 
have a new enemy, and it's a moving target. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first we thought, great, tourism; it's clean," Groene says. "But now it's 
out of control. The bighorn sheep barely survived the uranium boom. Now the 
mountain bikers might finish them off." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Moab's visitors have little knowledge of treading lightly in desert 
ecosystems, officials say. Pollution and threats to wildlife are just a part of 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps of greatest concern to scientists is the health of the area's soils, 
already stressed from limited nutrients and the dry climate. Known as 
cryptobiotic soil, the desert's dense, crusty surface helps prevent erosion, 
absorb scarce water and process nitrogen critical for plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Tire treads and footprints compact and kill the black soil, which is made up 
of lichens, fungi and microbial bacteria. "Where these soils are heavily 
trampled," says Jayne Belnap, a Moab-based research ecologist for the National 
Park Service and the National Biological Survey, "the ecosystem literally shuts 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 Partly in response to research by Belnap and others, the National Park Service 
and BLM are trying to educate visitors to stay on trails and roads. A national 
mountain bike patrol, the country's first, is slated to roam the Moab area in 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The town and county also are trying to soften the impact of the sporting 
masses. Moab's tourism bureau plans to insert a list of environmental 
guidelines in every information packet it sends this summer. And the county 
council got so fed up with the constant buzz of scenic helicopters that it 
issued a moratorium on new licenses in November. Councilman Hedden says he 
would like to eliminate heli-biking, in which helicopters drop off bikers at 
remote, pristine locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Grand County also hopes it can recoup some of the costs of servicing the 
endless stream of desert adventurers. Last year, the sheriff's office performed 
more search and rescue operations on its small budget than the rest of Utah 
combined. In an unusual arrangement, the county and the BLM are considering 
charging a joint fee for people who want to camp or engage in other recreation 
near the Slickrock trail. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to look at ways for visitors to help cover the costs of protecting 
the resource and maintaining it," Von Koch says.

HAITIANS STOP U.S. SENATOR'S TRIP TO BORDER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Army troops forced a U.S. senator Sunday to abandon a fact-finding trip to the 
border with the Dominican Republic in the latest snub to international efforts 
to force military leaders into giving up power. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed soldiers turned back U.S. Sen. Bob Graham of Florida when he tried to 
visit Haiti's border with the Dominican Republic to check on enforcement of 
international economic sanctions against Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied by U.S. Ambassador William L. Swing, Graham's visit came two days 
after Haiti's de facto government barred foreigners, including reporters, from 
the border, the coastline, Haiti's international waters and other "strategic 
areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Graham, a Democrat, said he was disappointed about being turned back but 
added, "I'm not surprised." 
</P>
<P>
 Graham called the decree restricting people's movement "the kind of action 
that you would expect from an authoritarian regime which considers itself to be 
increasingly isolated and under threat." 
</P>
<P>
 The embargo is designed to pressure the ruling military to turn over power to 
elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was ousted in a September, 1991, 
coup. President Clinton last week barred most financial transactions between 
the two countries, and U.S. commercial flights will stop at midnight Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Military leaders have enriched themselves on sales of black-market gasoline 
smuggled across the border from the Dominican Republic, Haiti's neighbor on the 
island of Hispaniola. Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer recently promised to 
seal the border, but gasoline has been getting through in such large quantities 
that its price in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, has dropped from $10 a 
gallon to $6. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview late Saturday, Graham said he favored U.S. military 
intervention within 60 days if sanctions fail to dislodge the army leaders. At 
Fumbya, Graham said he was confident Clinton would take decisive action in 
Haiti to counter charges of "vacillation" in his foreign policy decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Haiti will be a place where the President can demonstrate his resolve," the 
senator said.

 Michel Rocard resigned as head of the French Socialist Party and was replaced 
by former National Assembly President Henri Emmanuelli, who took over as 
provisional party chief.Rocard, the party's likely presidential candidate, 
resigned after a no-confidence vote by the party's national council. The move 
followed the Socialists' disastrous results in last weekend's European 
Parliament elections when they received only 14.4% of the vote, their worst 
score in decades. Emmanuelli, 49, will head the party until a scheduled 
congress this fall or until a special convention is called to choose the 
Socialist candidate for the April, 1995, presidential election.

 Israeli warplanes attacked Shiite Muslim guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon 
as Shiites observed the martyrdom of their most revered saint with parades and 
self-flagellation.Two fighter-bombers fired six rockets on hills surrounding 
the village of Mlita in Apple province, a stronghold of the Iranian-backed 
Shiite fundamentalists of Hezbollah. Israel's army said the warplanes attacked 
"terrorist" targets used by Hezbollah in the Jebel Safi area. Hezbollah said 
none of its guerrillas were wounded in the late-morning raid, the fourth since 
June 2.

<TEXT>
<P>
 North Korean leader Kim Il Sung at first rejected former President Jimmy 
Carter's proposal to turn over remains of U.S. servicemen from the Korean War. 
Then came the nod from Kim's wife, Kim Jong Ae. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK," the Great Leader told Carter. "It's done. It's done." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter relayed the deal-making moment to reporters with a chuckle, part of a 
90-minute interview full of wide-eyed optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said we can include that in future negotiations. I said that's not what 
I'm asking for," Carter said, perched at the edge of a flowery chair in a 
downtown hotel suite. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then his wife broke in and told him he should do it, which I thought was very 
nice," Carter said. "She is a very attractive lady." 
</P>
<P>
 Just like that, the deal was done. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials are now busy trying to confirm whether Kim intends to carry out 
the promise, along with several others Carter said he secured on last week's 
trip to North Korea.

BLACKS' FEAR OF CRIME JUMPS, STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fear of neighborhood crime has risen almost twice as much among blacks as 
whites, reflecting the fact that violent crime strikes African Americans more 
frequently, the Justice Department reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The department's Bureau of Justice Statistics said that from 1985 to 1991, the 
percentage of white households that believed crime in their neighborhoods was a 
serious problem grew from 4% of all white households to 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 During the same period, the number of black households expressing serious 
concern about neighborhood crime almost doubled -- from 9% of all black 
households to almost 17%. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 60,000 households were surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
 In central cities, black households viewing neighborhood crime as serious rose 
from 12% to 23% over the period. 
</P>
<P>
 Among white inner-city households, the percentage citing neighborhood crime as 
serious rose from 8% in 1985 to 13% in 1991. It was not the most frequently 
mentioned neighborhood problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Among all urban households, 15% cited crime as a neighborhood problem, 
compared with 5% of suburban and 2% of rural households.

MOYNIHAN PUSHES FOR ACTION ON HEALTH BILL; REFORM: COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN URGES 
CLINTON TO WORK WITH CONGRESS BEFORE JULY 4 RECESS. SENATOR SAYS COMPROMISE ON 
UNIVERSAL COVERAGE NECESSARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) urged President Clinton on Sunday to 
stay in Washington and work with Congress on passing a health care reform bill, 
warning that committee action is critical by the July 4 recess. 
</P>
<P>
 While contending that odds are better than 50-50 for final passage of a bill 
this year, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee said Congress will not 
provide universal coverage immediately but will go a long way toward the 
President's goal. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Clinton told Congress he would veto any bill that does not cover 
all Americans. But some Administration officials have indicated the White House 
might consider a phased-in approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan, on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press," likened the situation to the initial 
enactment of Social Security in 1935, which started out covering primarily 
males in manufacturing, about 60% of the population. Four years later, Congress 
extended retirement benefits to include spouses and added survivors' insurance, 
he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Clinton's veto threat, Moynihan said: "I think a bill that took you a 
long way toward universal coverage and declared universal coverage to be the 
policy of the United States to be achieved in a time certain, that fits his 
conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if backers of health reform needed a signal from the President, 
Moynihan said Clinton should say, " 'I'm staying right here in town working 
with you until we get this thing done.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is scheduled to attend a fund-raiser in St. Louis on Friday for House 
Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.). 
</P>
<P>
 House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), also appearing Sunday on the NBC 
news program, denied reports that he is leading a drive to block any health 
care bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich said he hoped "a genuinely bipartisan bill" would be passed by a 
large margin rather than enacting a bill by a slim margin, which he denounced 
as "the tax increase strategy from last year" when the President's budget was 
narrowly approved. 
</P>
<P>
 He also defended accepting more than $500,000 in campaign contributions from 
interests opposed to Clinton's health bill, claiming that it did not impair his 
objectivity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find this a very bizarre double standard, where people whose newspapers and 
whose television stations take advertising from virtually anybody and are 
somehow pristine pure, that then they turn to politics," Gingrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan acknowledged that some of his colleagues on the finance panel are 
trying to broker deals on other tax issues as part of health reform, notably 
Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.), who wants breaks for the oil and gas industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "They won't be in the bill," Moynihan said, after observing that "you can't be 
on the Finance Committee and be a senator from Louisiana without wanting to 
have tax breaks for the oil and gas industry on anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan also said he wanted to open hearings on Clinton's welfare reform 
proposal "the minute we have just a moment's window in the health care 
proceedings." While saying that Congress "might surprise" those who see no 
likelihood of a welfare bill this year, Moynihan acknowledged that "paying for 
it is a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 He went along with one suggestion that, like health care reform, the welfare 
bill will be incremental -- not ending welfare as "we know it," which Clinton 
promised during his presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life is incremental, one day at a time," Moynihan said. "And thank God. I 
couldn't take much more."

JET MAKES LOW PASS OVER SANTA ANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The pilot of a Southwest Airlines jetliner on approach to John Wayne Airport 
late Sunday "lost sight" of the airport when he flew low over south Santa Ana, 
then boosted the jets when instructed by tower officials to climb higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Berg, Federal Aviation Administration duty officer in Los Angeles who 
contacted John Wayne tower, said the Southwest jet was then ordered to go 
around for another approach about 10:20 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Southwest airliner jet was making a visual approach into John Wayne," Berg 
said, "and he lost sight of the airport.The tower immediately ordered him to 
climb, and he started climbing (rapidly) and headed west." 
</P>
<P>
 The airplane later landed safely at John Wayne Airport. The FAA did not know 
where the flight had originated. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesperson for the airlines could not be reached late Sunday.

CRASH AT REOPENED DRAG STRIP KILLS LOMITA DRIVER, 50 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Lomita man was killed when he lost control of his car on a Terminal Island 
raceway that reopened last year, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman Perry, 50, was cut from the wreckage of his car with the Jaws-of-Life 
rescue tool after it crashed on the Brotherhood Raceway drag strip and was 
ripped in two about 9:15 p.m. Saturday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver was taken to San Pedro Peninsula Hospital and was declared dead at 
10:08 p.m., police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash was the first of its kind at the raceway, which reopened last year 
under the auspices of the Brotherhood of Street Racers, said Mike Bowen, a vice 
president of that organization. The raceway originally opened in 1979 but was 
closed in the mid-1980s when the Port of Los Angeles needed the land for other 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen said he doesn't expect the crash to hurt business. Drag-racers are very 
aware of the risks of racing, he said. "It's just an unfortunate aspect of 
drag-racing," Bowen said. "The faster you go, the better the chances are that 
something will happen."

QUAKES RATTLE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY, EUREKA AREA, ALASKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moderate earthquakes were felt Sunday in several Northern California 
communities and Kodiak, Alaska, while three small aftershocks of the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake rattled the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 No damage was reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northern California quake struck at 3:39 a.m. and measured magnitude 4.9, 
said Mike Antolik of the University of California seismographic station in 
Berkeley. It was centered about 36 miles southwest of Eureka. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt stronger than a large truck going by on a freeway," said Frank 
Mancinelli, an announcer at radio station KINS in Eureka. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alaska quake had a preliminary magnitude of 4.3 and was centered about 15 
miles northeast of Kodiak. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, the aftershocks Sunday morning were no stronger than 
magnitude 2.8.

DUST NEAR STARS SAID TO BE PRECURSOR OF PLANETS; ASTRONOMY: HUBBLE TELESCOPE 
REVEALS HUGE DISKS OF MATERIAL AROUND YOUNG SUNS. THE MATTER WILL EVENTUALLY 
CONDENSE INTO SPHERES, SCIENTISTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The repaired Hubble Space Telescope has given astronomers their clearest look 
yet at the process of planetary formation around other stars, scientists said 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Observing 110 young stars in the Orion Nebula, a great cloud of interstellar 
gas 1,500 light years from Earth, astronomer C. Robert O'Dell of Rice 
University in Houston found that more than half were surrounded by mammoth 
disks of dust that researchers believe will eventually condense into planets. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery is "strong proof" that the so-called protoplanetary disks, and 
hence planets themselves, are "a common product of star formation," O'Dell said 
at a NASA news conference in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The observations confirm indirect evidence that planets, and thus life itself, 
are not unique to our own solar system, but are ubiquitous throughout the 
universe. "This is one more (piece of) the argument" that life exists 
elsewhere, O'Dell said. 
</P>
<P>
 And unlike the recent discovery of three planets circling an unusual star 
called a pulsar, the new observations involve stars much more similar to our 
own sun and should lend insight into the genesis of the Earth and its 
neighbors, O'Dell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot to learn about the formation of our solar system by watching 
these (protoplanetary disks)," said astronomer Anne L. Kinney of the Space 
Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 The search for evidence of planets and planetary formation outside our solar 
system has long been a preoccupation of astronomers, many of whom refuse to 
believe that humans are alone in the universe. Mathematical formulations 
indicate that if there are a lot of planets, then the probability of life 
existing independently of Earth is also high. 
</P>
<P>
 That quest has been extremely difficult because planets are so small and dim. 
Planets the size of those in our solar system could not be seen by the Hubble 
telescope even if they were circling the nearest star, only four light years 
away, according to astronomer Suzan Edwards of Smith College in Northampton, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 But if those same planets were ground up into small pieces and scattered 
through an area the size of our solar system or larger, they would form a cloud 
that would be a lot easier to spot, said astronomer Stephen P. Maran of NASA's 
Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 And with its newly repaired optics, in fact, the Hubble did spot such 
protoplanetary disks in the first place it looked, the stellar nursery called 
the Orion Nebula. Less than 1 million years old, the nebula is a seething mass 
of hot gases that are condensing into stars much like our own. The density of 
matter in the nebula is about 100,000 times the density in the region of our 
solar system. 
</P>
<P>
 Conventional theory suggests that when a clump of gas and dust coalesces under 
the force of gravity to form a star, from 1% to 10% of the original material is 
left behind and accumulates in a disk around the star, Edwards said. 
Eventually, gravity also causes matter in the disks to coalesce into planets. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Dell originally observed the disks with the Hubble two years ago, before the 
telescope was repaired. But the resolution was so poor because of the 
instrument's faulty optics that it was impossible to tell whether he was 
observing disks or shells of dust that were unlikely to coalesce into planets. 
Now, since the repair, the resolution of the telescope is twice as good, 
enabling him and his colleagues to see that they are in fact disks. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the increased resolution enabled them to estimate the mass and 
density of the disks. They found that the mass of the outer edge of the disks, 
for example, was large enough to make seven to 10 Earths. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Dell said that it is virtually certain that he is watching planetary 
formation. "There is no possible alternative explanation for the observations," 
he said. "Once you've seen them (the disks), this has got to be what it is."

A FIGHTING CHANCE; GANG MEMBERS LEARN THE ART OF DISCIPLINE AT VAN NUYS GYM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hector Lopez is making the gang boys sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 Not in some airless room down at headquarters, but in a Van Nuys gym heavy 
with the sound of fists on pads. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, one of the world's top-ranked super-lightweight fighters, tells a dozen 
young men to jog in place until their shorts are wet around the midsection and 
a fine wet sheen covers the tattoos that identify the neighborhood allegiances 
for which so many like them have died. A young man with "SANFER" emblazoned on 
his chest and a nasty vertical scar crawling up his ankle shifts into a 
fighting pose, making sharp exhaling noises through his nose as he boxes the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 A half-smile softens Lopez's hard-eyed fighter's countenance. "There you go, 
there you go," he says to another gang member, who has just mastered a 
three-punch combination. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people couldn't afford to buy the kind of training Lopez doles out to 
these young men for free. It is Lopez's belief that society can't afford not to 
give it to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice a week, anywhere from 10 to 35 gang members attend these grueling 
training sessions at the Jet Center gym, which is owned and operated by 
champion kick boxers Benny (The Jet) Urquidez and William (Blinky) Rodriguez, 
along with Rodriguez's wife, Lilly, herself a champion fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, the principal instructor in the training classes, is one of the 
architects of the peace treaty between Latino gangs in the Valley that has so 
far lasted seven months. Though the truce has not been without problems -- 
isolated shootings and beatings have flared up between the neighborhoods -- 
there have been no killings of gang members in that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Some might find it odd to train gangbangers to fight. Isn't that like shipping 
arms to Krupp? For one thing, the gang members already know how to fight. What 
they don't know, and what they are learning from Lopez and Rodriguez, is how to 
fight fair and respect the combat they have chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time they begin their sessions, they bow to each other. When they leave, 
they bow to the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Rodriguez, 23, is a big kid with a shaved head and a soft, muscled body 
that he has hardened up considerably over the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, you had one thing in mind: getting in fights," says Rodriguez, who 
has spent 16 months in jail for carrying a weapon and still carries a scar from 
being stabbed in the head. "Here they're teaching us discipline." 
</P>
<P>
 The discipline keeps him focused on his responsibilities. He has a wife and 
two young children. For the past two years he has worked for a 
telecommunications company in the fraud division. 
</P>
<P>
 "I give a lot to Hector and Blinky," he says. "They're not getting paid for 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 For Lopez, his work with the gang members is a kind of pay-back. He still 
bears his own neighborhood identifier, a tattoo on his back that says 
"Toonerville," which is in Atwater. Once Southern California's greatest young 
fighter, Lopez was a silver medalist in the 1984 Olympics and seemed a 
certainty for ring immortality when his career was sidetracked by a three-year 
prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 He had stayed away from the neighborhood while he was training for the 
Olympics. After the games, he built an impressive record as a featherweight, 
gaining the No. 1 ranking in the world. "But I couldn't get a title shot," he 
says. "I let frustration get in." 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 9, 1988, he was arrested on suspicion of kidnaping his girlfriend at 
gunpoint. That charge was dropped, but Lopez was convicted of two assault 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a real bad temper," Lopez confesses simply. 
</P>
<P>
 Since getting out of prison two years ago, he has re-established his career, 
married the woman he was accused of kidnaping and become involved in 
Rodriguez's church, Victory Outreach. When Rodriguez told him he had started a 
training class for gang members and asked him to help, he quickly agreed, even 
though his own training schedule leaves him exhausted by the time the evening 
classes at the Jet Center roll around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like Blinky and my pastor were there to help me," Lopez says. "If I 
can pass it on, so much the better. I'm glad I'm out here." 
</P>
<P>
 He has an obvious and immediate rapport with the young men he teaches. When he 
goes up on his toes to demonstrate a move, his fluid self-control is obvious. 
When he tells them to give him 50 pushups, there is barely a groan of 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been there sitting in the same holding tank they're sitting in," Lopez 
says, explaining the unquestioned respect he receives. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows people would pay him a lot for the training he is donating. He 
shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm making treasures in heaven," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The real payoff is in the words of people like Raul Rodriguez. He is thankful 
for the truce, and it has shown him a wondrous new world without invisible 
borders of danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels safer," he says. "Now I'm able to go to my grandma's house and not 
get shot by a rival gang."

DEBATE OVER FREE SPEECH STOPS KATZ'S ANTI-HATE BILL; LEGISLATION: PROPOSAL 
TARGETING RACIST LITERATURE IS CRITICIZED AS BEING TOO BROADLY WORDED, 
PROMPTING THE ASSEMBLYMAN TO WITHDRAW IT. 
</P>

<P>
 The recruiters were remarkably brazen, tucking racist flyers into school 
lockers, tossing them about library grounds -- even littering toy store parking 
lots with the graphic hate literature. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you've had enough . . . ," call this number, the flyers implored beneath 
a litany of insults aimed at Jews and Latinos. A recording urged callers to 
join a white supremacist group. 
</P>
<P>
 That hatemongers were targeting children in the San Fernando Valley by 
distributing flyers where they likely would find them was alarming to parents, 
educators and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those stepping forward in response was Assemblyman Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar), who authored legislation to halt the disturbing trend, unaware 
that, in so doing, he would spark a broader debate over free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 What resulted was an ideological scuffle between the lawmaker and defenders of 
the First Amendment, with Katz eventually withdrawing his bill. The legislation 
had been scheduled for a committee vote Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz's bill would have made it a crime to distribute to children any work that 
"advocates violence against any person or group because of their race, color, 
religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, gender or sexual orientation." 
Violators would be subject to penalties of up to one year in jail and a $10,000 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounded like a noble, and simple enough, idea. 
</P>
<P>
 But because its language was so broad, booksellers and others found themselves 
wondering if they too could be targeted for selling classics to youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our concern was that the definition was so broad that even literary works 
would have been drawn into the net," said Chris Finan, executive director of 
Media Coalition Inc., a New York advocacy firm that represents the publishing 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the bill become law, Finan said, book distributors might have been 
prosecuted for selling to minors such timeless works as William Styron's 
"Confessions of Nat Turner," a story about a slave rebellion, or John 
Steinbeck's epic "Grapes of Wrath," in which native Californians viciously 
attack "Okies." 
</P>
<P>
 The bill had even sparked concern from the librarians' lobby, who sought and 
received a special exemption from the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the sponsor was aiming at a particular problem, the effect of the bill 
would have been to put a bookseller in danger of being arrested by an 
overzealous police officer," said Finan. "You could hardly sell a newspaper. . 
. . The problems were endless. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Katz said he is now looking for other ways to try to halt 
distribution of hate literature to impressionable youths -- possibly by 
stepping up penalties for trespassing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he attempted to model his bill after a law that keeps pornography out 
of the hands of children -- a law that the courts have upheld -- doing so 
proved tricky. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not been able to craft the bill yet in a way to get to the real 
scumbags without walking all over the booksellers," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been a lot of questions raised over how you distinguish between 
hate material and other material." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said he will go back to the drawing board in an effort to find another 
way to tackle the problem. "I think it's important that the issue be raised," 
he said. "I still believe we ought to find a way to protect children from this 
kind of violence and hatred." 
</P>
<P>
 Finan said the bill's opponents had held a series of meetings with Katz and 
were relieved when the lawmaker decided to pull the measure from Tuesday's 
legislative calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 "If one looks at it as a hate-crimes bill, it's easy to see why you might want 
to do something about that problem," Finan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if you look at it from the free-speech vantage point, it was really quite 
dangerous to First Amendment freedoms."

MIDGET-CAR RACER DIES AFTER SPEEDWAY CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Grosso, who helped found an association of midget-car enthusiasts, died 
early Sunday from injuries suffered in a demonstration race at Saugus Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 Grosso, 67, who was airlifted to UCLA Medical Center after the crash, was 
pronounced dead at 12:45 a.m., said a hospital spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Nuys resident carried on a lifelong love affair with cars, dating back 
to his school days at North Hollywood High School, where he met his wife, 
Florence, said his grandson George McFarland, 23. 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of the Western Racing Assn., Grosso participated in demonstration 
races at tracks from El Cajon to Napa, said Dan Fleisher, the president of the 
association. The association was formed 13 years ago to retain the heritage of 
the early midget race cars, the precursors to modern-day midget racers, 
Fleisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We keep these cars as true to the eras of the '40s and '50s as possible to 
allow people to see the cars and hear the sounds," Fleisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grosso's car, Flossie's Offy, named after his wife, was a classic midget car 
of its era, equipped with a 110-cubic-inch, four-cylinder Offenhauser engine, a 
popular German racing engine of the era. 
</P>
<P>
 Grosso's business office, where he sold lighting supplies, was known to most 
of the 325 members of the association as "The Bunker," and was a favorite 
gathering spot, Fleisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a demonstration race on Saturday, Grosso collided with Rudy Sorer, whose 
car spun out in the middle of the main straightaway on the paved one-third-mile 
oval about halfway through an eight-lap demonstration race, Fleisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grosso's car shot into the air, flipped once and landed on its wheels in the 
accident, Fleisher said. Fleisher said Grosso's car was thrown into the air 
after it apparently hit the wheels of Sorer's car. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could have gone 10 miles an hour and go over the wheel of another car and 
go airborne," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorer was taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital, where he was treated for cuts 
and lacerations and released, said a nursing supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy is expected to be conducted to determine the exact cause of 
Grosso's death, friends and family members said. Services for Grosso are 
pending.

REMAINS DISCOVERED AT CASTAIC MAY STEM FROM 1977 ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Skull fragments and other bones discovered near the bottom of a 400-foot 
canyon north of Castaic appear to be those of an Iowa man who died about seven 
years ago when his pickup truck veered off a road in the Angeles National 
Forest, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The remains found below the old California 99 and north of the Templin Highway 
by U.S. Forest Service firefighters Saturday afternoon were too decomposed to 
be identified as a man or a woman, California Highway Patrol investigators 
said. But they said clothing, including a man's shirt found zipped inside a 
winter jacket, appear to be what the victim was wearing at the time of death. 
There was no identification in the vehicle, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
 An unloaded handgun, a rusty shotgun loaded with one round of ammunition and 
videotapes were also found near the wreckage of the pickup, which lost its 
camper shell about halfway down the steep canyon. The vehicle had an Iowa 
license plate with tags that expired seven years ago. The CHP said the 
condition of the remains suggests that the victim's death occurred about that 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHP said there is no evidence of foul play and is investigating the 
incident as a fatal car crash. A spokeswoman said missing-person reports were 
checked but a match could not immediately be made. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Dzialo, a fire captain with the U.S. Forest Service, said he and a 
battalion chief were driving south on the Golden State Freeway when he noticed 
something in the adjacent canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Boy, that looks like a car,' " Dzialo said. "I just happened to 
notice it. It's green in color so it blends in with the vegetation." 
</P>
<P>
 The two hiked down through the thick brush and discovered pieces of a skull 
and teeth in the rocks and dirt near the camper shell before coming upon the 
wreckage of the 1977 pickup, which was demolished in the accident. Dzialo said 
he was not surprised that the accident site went unnoticed for seven years. "In 
this steep terrain and this type of vegetation," he said, "if a vehicle goes 
into the brush, it blends in and gets overgrown." 
</P>
<P>
 The area, creased with wide canyons covered with thick brush, is near a 
popular recreation area and campsite called Frenchmans Flat, where people hike, 
fish and camp, said Jan Graham of the U.S. Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The remains have been turned over to the Los Angeles County coroner's office, 
which is investigating the case.

STRAWBERRY SIGNS WITH GIANTS; BASEBALL: THEY HOPE TO HAVE TROUBLED FORMER 
DODGER IN RIGHT FIELD BY JULY 11, REPLACING MCGEE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Darryl Strawberry, having completed a drug rehabilitation program at the Betty 
Ford Center, took the first step toward rehabilitating his baseball career 
Sunday by signing to play the remainder of the season for the San Francisco 
Giants. The team hopes he will be playing right field for them by the All-Star 
Break, July 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like anybody who lives in this country, he deserves another chance," Giant 
Manager Dusty Baker said. "I'm looking forward to him joining the team next 
month." 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry, who has not played in a regular-season major league game since 
June of last season, will begin a conditioning program under team supervision 
and follow that with a minor league assignment. He will replace right fielder 
Willie McGee, who is sidelined for the season because of a ruptured Achilles' 
tendon. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry, 32, has not spoken publicly since telling the Dodgers on April 4 
that he had a drug abuse problem. After he completed a program at the Betty 
Ford center, Strawberry's doctors recommended a change of playing environment, 
and the Dodgers mutually agreed to release Strawberry on May 25.  
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry was not at the news conference in San Francisco, but he said in a 
statement he believes "that being a member of the Giants presented a 
comfortable atmosphere for my return to the game." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've missed the competitiveness and can't wait until I can actively join the 
club and hopefully contribute to a pennant-winning season." 
</P>
<P>
 Financial terms were not disclosed, but it is believed that the Giants are 
paying Strawberry the major league minimum of $109,000, prorated to about 
$63,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry was already paid $642,857 by the Dodgers this season and, in his 
settlement, the club agreed to pay him $4,857,143 by July 1. That includes the 
balance of his 1994 salary and half of the $5 million owed Strawberry for next 
season, which was the final year of his five-year, $20.25-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger players said that they wished Strawberry the best. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope he's been able to get himself together so that the same things 
don't present themselves again," second baseman Delino DeShields said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any doubt about his ability." 
</P>
<P>
 Center fielder Brett Butler said that Strawberry has stopped by his house and 
they have talked on the phone a few times recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not surprised that he signed with the Giants, because I know Dusty's 
relationship with Straw," Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can carry a club and we all know that. . . . I would have preferred not to 
have him in the league. I'll have to call and congratulate him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants are hoping Strawberry will help revive the worst offense in the 
league. The team is nine games under .500 and 5 1/2 games behind the Dodgers in 
the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry, 32, has a .259 lifetime batting average and hit at least 26 home 
runs every season from 1983-1991. But, bothered by a back injury, he played in 
a total of 75 games the last two seasons with the Dodgers, hitting only 10 
homers and driving in 37 runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope as I have always hoped that Darryl has a long and successful career, 
and has in life in order," Dodger Executive Vice President Fred Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have had a part in that, just like other players who have gone 
through trying times, like Steve Howe and Bobby Welch. You want to see them 
succeed. That doesn't stop, it continues."

DID GRASS SCARE OFF PIERCE?; WIMBLEDON: WITHDRAWAL OF FRENCH OPEN FINALIST 
LEADS TO MUCH SPECULATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The London tabloids are in mourning, to say nothing of the All England Lawn 
and Tennis Club, where a fortnight of Wimbledon begins today without the 
tormented Mary Pierce, without much suspense and without a monopoly on the 
days' headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, seeded seventh and set to make her first Wimbledon appearance, 
withdrew from the tournament late Saturday, citing "reasons far beyond my 
control." In Pierce-speak, that presumably means her father, banished from the 
tour for verbally abusing the 19-year-old star, was making a beeline for 
Wimbledon, ban or no ban. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone was convinced. Billie Jean King, interviewed for British 
television, suggested that Pierce was scared stiff of the draw, so much so that 
fellow players were making bets on when she would pull out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the players think the story about her dad was just a smoke screen," 
said King, a former Wimbledon champion who is here as an HBO analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 A more likely scenario is that Pierce is simply scared of Wimbledon's grass 
courts. After reaching the French Open final, Pierce arrived at the Volkswagen 
Cup at nearby Eastbourne and was beaten promptly in the quarterfinals of an 
under-21 event by Czech Ludmila Varmuzova, ranked 639th. 
</P>
<P>
 The surface: grass. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reasons, Pierce, one of only two players to defeat No. 1-ranked 
Steffi Graf this year, is a no-show. Her absence not only ruins things for the 
Fleet Street beasties ("I Love To Walk Around My House Naked," read a recent 
Pierce-inspired headline in the Daily Mirror), but it also further reduces the 
chances of anyone upsetting the near-invincible Graf on the clipped-grass 
courts, where she has won three consecutive titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, it would have been a stretch. Pierce beat Graf on the clay courts of 
Roland Garros, which isn't exactly the same thing as the fickle crew-cut 
surfaces of Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mary killed her . . . well, beat her pretty bad," said Murrieta's Lindsay 
Davenport, who is seeded seventh after moving up two spots following Pierce's 
withdrawal. "More players now have a little more confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's ignorance, maybe it's jet lag, but Davenport said she has as good a 
chance as anyone of moving through the brackets. Big girl. Big serve. Big game. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Davenport, 18, didn't arrive until Sunday -- she skipped the 
pre-tournament practice sessions at Wimbledon to attend her high school 
graduation ceremony -- and didn't hear about Pierce's decision until early 
afternoon. As for the supposed reason for Pierce's absence, Davenport didn't 
buy it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think she'd pull out because of that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 So, gone is Pierce, and long gone is Monica Seles, leaving the task of an 
unlikely upset of Graf to the likes of No. 4 Martina Navratilova, No. 2 Arantxa 
Sanchez Vicario and No. 3 Conchita Martinez, both of Spain, and No. 5 Jana 
Novotna of the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova, a nine-time singles winner at Wimbledon and the oldest player in 
the draw at 37, is making her final singles appearance at the Grand Slam event. 
Though Navratilova was beaten in the quarterfinals at Eastbourne, her 
serve-and-volley game could get her to the semifinals, maybe to the final if 
the tennis gods have a flair for the dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez Vicario is fresh from winning the French Open, while Martinez has the 
memory of last year's trip to the Wimbledon semifinals. Novotna led, 4-1, 
against Graf in the third set of last year's final before losing. 
</P>
<P>
 Longshots? Eighth-seeded Natalia Zvereva of Russia, 30th-seeded Zina 
Garrison-Jackson or perhaps unseeded Lori McNeil, who faces Graf in the first 
round. In 1992, McNeil upset Graf in the opening round of the Virginia Slims 
Championship and became the lowest ranked player (No. 18 at the time) to defeat 
the German star since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 The men's side of the draw is more muddled. No. 1-seeded and defending 
champion Pete Sampras has one of the deadliest serves in the game -- a 
near-must to win Wimbledon -- and has lost only five matches all year. But on 
occasion, Sampras has a knack of struggling with his concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany's Michael Stich, who won here in 1991, is seeded second and is 6-1 on 
grass this year, and Sweden's Stefan Edberg, seeded third, has won two 
Wimbledon titles and has the serve-and-volley game to win another. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, who knows? Croatian Goran Ivanisevic, seeded fourth, has the 
killer serve and the killer inconsistency. Fifth-seeded Jim Courier reached the 
final of last year's tournament, but will be the first to acknowledge that 
grass isn't his favorite playing surface. American Todd Martin, who is seeded 
sixth, beat Sampras in the final at Queen's Club a week ago, which should count 
for something. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is seventh-seeded Boris Becker of Germany, a three-time champion 
who almost always plays well at Wimbledon. But as late as Sunday evening, there 
were rumors that he might withdraw because of a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Agassi, two years removed from his surprising Wimbledon title, is 
healthy, happy and capable of confounding the experts once more. Last year, he 
arrived with a gut, but no chest hair. This time, no gut and . . . well, no 
word on the chest hair.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; BALBOA IS LEADING MAN FOR U.S.; GROUP A: 
DEFENDER TAKES CHARGE ON THE BACK LINE, DELIGHTING THE COACHING STAFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The transformation of Marcelo Balboa was not physical and it was not mental. 
It was verbal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the U.S. team's opening World Cup game Saturday, the emphasis changed, from 
offensive strength to defensive prowess. Balboa's role in the game in the 
Silverdome at Pontiac, Mich., was cited as key to salvaging a 1-1 tie with 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 Balboa's contribution? He spoke. For the first time, he assumed the leadership 
role the U.S. coaching staff has for so long been coaxing the veteran of the 
1990 World Cup to grab. 
</P>
<P>
 Few U.S. players have been willing to act as the vital communications center 
at the back of the formation, to be the player who directs the movement and 
tactical alignment of the team. Balboa did all of that Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marcelo really lifted his game," U.S. assistant coach Steve Sampson said 
Sunday. "Something I haven't seen from Marcelo in a long, long time -- he was 
very vocal. Every coach on this team has talked to him about that aspect of the 
game. It's important that he organize the defense. He demonstrated leadership. 
Maybe it was the event. Thank God, it was desperately needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Balboa didn't make an issue of his new voice in postgame interviews, but those 
who have followed the team immediately spotted -- and heard -- the change. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something I've had a hard time doing," Balboa said. "(Saturday), it was 
a thing I had to do. I had to yell more. It was difficult to do because there 
were so many people in the stadium. But we needed to communicate." 
</P>
<P>
 While the contact and communication between the U.S. defense and midfield was 
good, the space between the midfield and the two forward players was lost 
against Switzerland. Midfielders were able to help out by dropping back on 
defense, but, as the game played out in 106-degree heat, midfielders were 
reluctant to join the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the game wore on, everyone got tired," Balboa said. "We weren't able to 
push up. We dropped back a little too far. Defensively, it worked well for us, 
but offensively we weren't able to go forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Balboa's performance was all the more impressive in light of the general 
ambivalence of U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic regarding Balboa and where, if 
anywhere, he might play. It began with Balboa's absence because of a knee 
injury and, after his return, Milutinovic's vagueness about whether he planned 
to employ a sweeper -- Balboa's longtime position -- or abandon the position in 
favor of a four-back defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic chose to compromise, using a four-back system in which Balboa does 
some sweeping chores. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some uncertainty," Sampson said of Balboa's place. "Everyone was 
aware of it, even Marcelo." 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, the defense played well against Switzerland. Alexi Lalas 
was particularly effective against Swiss striker Stephane Chapuisat, a 
world-class player whom Lalas rendered a non-factor. Chapuisat's teammate Alain 
Sutter was roaming the midfield dangerously, but he drew one and at times two 
defenders. His presence created space that -- had Chapuisat been unmarked -- 
the striker might have exploited. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team returned to its sequestered hotel in Dana Point late Saturday 
night and the non-starting players practiced Sunday. Midfielder Claudio Reyna, 
who did not play Saturday because of a strained hamstring, practiced Sunday, 
but he still has pain when he strikes the ball and is listed as probable to 
play against Colombia on Wednesday at the Rose Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
 Eric Wynalda, who scored the U.S. goal Saturday, did not practice and is still 
recovering from an allergic reaction that caused him to break out in hives. 
Team officials say the condition is expected to clear up in a few days.

BOLIVIA'S ETCHEVERRY, SPAIN'S NADAL OUT FOR REST OF FIRST ROUND AFTER GETTING 
RED CARDS IN FIRST GAMES. SPAIN TO APPEAL.

<P>
 In a move leaving little doubt that rough play will not be tolerated during 
World Cup '94, a soccer disciplinary panel Sunday suspended key players from 
Bolivia and Spain for the rest of the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Marco Etcheverry of Bolivia and Miguel Nadal of Spain must sit out two games 
after each was ejected for bruising tackles in separate matches during the 
opening day of the World Cup on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the harsh sanctions were not a surprise, they signaled a departure 
from the past, when players were suspended for one game after drawing a 
red-card ejection. 
</P>
<P>
 In following an edict of executives of FIFA, soccer's world governing body, 
the panel members sent a strong message to defenders who are used to killing 
scoring opportunities by tripping attackers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to crack down on violent action," said Joseph Blatter, general 
secretary of FIFA. 
</P>
<P>
 The disciplinary panel, meeting at FIFA headquarters in Irving, also ruled 
that two yellow-card warnings for one player during first-round matches would 
result in automatic one-game suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the suspensions that ignited the World Cup's first major 
controversy as Spanish and Bolivian officials fumed over the severity of the 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Javier Clemente of Spain said in Chicago that the team will appeal 
Nadal's suspension although he holds out little hope of getting the decision 
overturned. 
</P>
<P>
 "When referees become the principal argument in the game, then it's goodby to 
soccer," Clemente said. "A lot of the referees don't have enough knowledge 
about the new regulations. There is a psychosis with tackles and not all the 
referees apply the rules in the same way," 
</P>
<P>
 Nadal said the ruling was painful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not intend to make the foul," he said. "I've played only 26 minutes and 
for my first foul in the match I might get thrown out of the World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Xavier Azkargorta, Bolivia's coach, said in Boston that Etcheverry deserved no 
more than a one-game suspension. Team officials said they would not appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't real aggression," Azkargorta said. "It's true he kicked him, but 
not so hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Bolivia and Spain will play with 11 men in their next games, the 
suspensions might affect their chances of reaching the second round from Group 
C. Etcheverry, who recently returned from a knee injury, is Bolivia's star 
scorer. Nadal, a versatile midfielder, is Spain's captain. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bolivian and Spanish soccer federations also were fined $3,570 on Sunday, 
the minimum under the rules for a red card. 
</P>
<P>
 Etcheverry was ejected in the Cup opener against Germany in Chicago after he 
tried to kick Lothar Matthaeus, Germany's captain. Later in Dallas, Nadal drew 
a red card when he tackled Kim Joo-sung from behind as the South Korean raced 
alone toward Spain's goal.

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; OLAJUWON STICKS AROUND TO DENY KNICKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Who said: 
</P>
<P>
 "You must work to establish a professional code of conduct. When you get into 
calling names and trying to embarrass your opponent after a game, that is 
wrong. It shows your own insecurity. I understand promoting the flashy plays. 
Sports is entertainment. But violence and talk are not entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
 A) Gandhi? 
</P>
<P>
 B) The Maharishi? 
</P>
<P>
 C) Hakeem Olajuwon? 
</P>
<P>
 Who said: 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what sport is for. If you are sitting at a dinner table with people 
from different nationalities, it's very difficult to discuss politics, to 
discuss religion. You get into fights. Sports should be something everybody can 
discuss and have fun. Everybody has his favorite team, favorite players. Sports 
should promote peace among peoples." 
</P>
<P>
 A) Buddha? 
</P>
<P>
 B) Mother Teresa? 
</P>
<P>
 C) Hakeem Olajuwon? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer to both, of course, is C) Olajuwon, that island of serenity in the 
midst of the NBA finals who looks like the last professional basketball player 
capable of enjoying the NBA's greatest moment of all, now scheduled for 
Wednesday, courtesy of his 30-point, 10-rebound Game 6, an 86-84 Houston Rocket 
victory that ended with Olajuwon tipping away the final shot by the New York 
Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon, a born-again Muslim, smiles, he jokes, he has perspective coming out 
of his ears, so much so that he risks losing his audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence isn't entertainment? Just where in America did he learn that? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, he's not from here? Well, it shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that we're officially in the post-heroes age, it should be noted that he 
has had his share of problems and inconsistencies and petulant moments and 
still commits the occasional dumb foul. 
</P>
<P>
 He had two of the latter Sunday night, proving he still isn't fully evolved 
yet, at least on a basketball floor: leaving his feet and colliding with 
Patrick Ewing, who was taking a 20-footer in the first half; reaching in on 
Ewing after missing a shot in the fourth quarter for his fifth foul. 
</P>
<P>
 That was with 6:07 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon told Coach Rudy Tomjanovich to cool out. Tomjanovich contemplated the 
devil (the Rockets, already sagging, starting down the stretch without 
Olajuwon) and the deep blue sea (Olajuwon fouling out), looked in Olajuwon's 
eyes and decided what the heck. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, the Knicks never got around to challenging Olajuwon. Ewing shot the 
ball twice more, missed both, went scoreless in the fourth quarter and was 
outscored by his opposite number, 30-17. 
</P>
<P>
 Knick Coach Pat Riley suggested it would have barely been worth the effort to 
try to foul Olajuwon out, that a great player knows how to stay out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The real story might be, the Knicks knew Olajuwon had Ewing's number. Ewing 
was six for 18 when Olajuwon got his fifth foul. Ewing's teammates were already 
looking elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Ewing's best move -- an 18-foot jumper -- was unlikely to draw 
another foul. Ewing is beginning to resemble James Edwards, once described by 
TNT's Doug Collins as "a seven-footer who takes a 10-footer and turns it into a 
15-footer." 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon has now outscored Ewing in the series, 163-115. This does not make 
Ewing a stiff, but no one wonders who the best center in the land is any more. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks ran that last play and saw Olajuwon get to John Starks' 
three-pointer, turning it into an airball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got a piece of it," Olajuwon said later. "That's all you need." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley called the night "very disheartening," a clue to how devastated the 
Knicks were. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley gives away little. If he says it was "very disheartening," that means 
the tears were flowing ankle deep in the Knick dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
 To the Knicks, sports is not just life and death, it's more important than 
that. To expect all of them to discuss an important game they've just lost is 
too much. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Starks, the Knick star of the night, took no questions. In the middle 
of the hubbub, he sat in a chair, with his feet up on another chair, his eyes 
closed and one finger to his temple, meditating or trying to levitate himself 
out of there. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon was asked what it would feel like to play in the biggest game of his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game itself is big," he said, grinning, "but it's still basketball."

WORLD CUP / USA 1994; A TALE OF TWO COUNTRIES; SWEDISH, CAMEROONIAN FANS ARE 
WORLDS APART IN PREGAME PARTYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Those Swedes. They do know how to party. 
</P>
<P>
 They started early Sunday in Manhattan Beach, well before stroke of noon, 
drinking beer and painting their faces and getting ready for the big one at the 
Rose Bowl. Some of the dozen or so Swedes at the posh beach house had been on a 
binge since the middle of the week, powering down 30 brews a day in preparation 
for this game of games, the country's opening round in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning could not have been more different, however, for another clutch of 
fans -- of the opponents, Cameroon. They woke in dormitory surroundings at the 
University of Southern California and were shuttled to the Hereafter 
Non-Alcoholic Supper Club in the Crenshaw area of Los Angeles. There they ate 
bread and butter and doughnuts and drank tea laced with lots of sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 And then the Cameroonians wondered aloud how they were going to get to 
Pasadena because the bus ride they had counted on had fallen through. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the story of fans and their day at the World Cup, the most-watched 
sporting event on the planet. It is one of those days when national pride 
struts its stuff, when the home flag is waved and hung from trees and held out 
the window during the drive to the stadium. It is a time when chests puff out 
and everyday caution is abandoned. It is the reason that soccer sometimes turns 
ugly. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Swedes who came here this week was Michael Christiansen, 23, of 
Lund. When he had been an exchange student in Los Angeles, Christiansen stayed 
with Greg and Ellen Hull of Manhattan Beach, he an accountant, she a teacher. 
So it was that he went there again for the World Cup, along with two friends, 
Rikard Persson and Fredrik Johansson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been partying nonstop since we got here," Johansson said early Sunday 
afternoon. "We just want to show our support for the Swedish national team. 
This is like a monthlong Super Bowl and we wanted to be here for it." 
</P>
<P>
 They closed several bars in the days leading up to the match and had gotten 
only a few hours of sleep the night before. When they awoke Sunday, 
bleary-eyed, they began pulling out fake plastic swords, Viking hats and 
inflatable headgear with the word Sweden emblazoned on them. Then they 
commenced to drink more beer. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had not been so kind to the fans of Cameroon, the African nation that 
stunned the world of soccer four years ago by reaching the quarterfinals in the 
World Cup. There had been the problem with the exhibit at Leimert Park, where 
the Cameroonians had hoped to sell artifacts from their homeland to help offset 
the expenses of the trip. But they had not gotten the right permits and found 
themselves mired in the red tape of bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 But they too had had some fun the night before the game, many of them going to 
a party at a South-Central social club. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were up late last night, dancing and singing," said Alexandre Oho Bambe, a 
leader of the Cameroonian delegation, who wore blue jeans, a Cameroon World Cup 
T-shirt and goatskin slippers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Hereafter Non-Alcoholic Supper Club, three rented vans pulled up to 
carry the fans to the Rose Bowl. They piled in, 14 or more to each car, along 
with several private cars that formed the Cameroonian convoy. 
</P>
<P>
 And at Manhattan Beach, the Swedes did their own squeezing as well, filling 
two Ford Broncos with 14 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time for the Viking war!" Christian exclaimed as they were getting ready 
to leave. Then they all gave a fierce growl as the Bronco eased onto the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to experience the World Cup," said one driver, Steve Compas. "Just 
to see the fans." 
</P>
<P>
 As they drove along, a caravan of cars and vans filled with Cameroonians 
passed them, their national flag waving from a window. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get them, get them!" the Swedes yelled in mock fierceness. Then they settled 
back to sing songs from the Ventures and occasionally break into dog howls. 
When they arrived at the Rose Bowl, they started looking for the Swedish 
tailgate party. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, the Cameroonians took a crazy-quilt path on and off freeways 
that took more than an hour to bring them to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like they say in Cameroon, it isn't easy, but they get it done," sighed a 
cook from the Hereafter, Myron McDowell, who had joined the Cameroonians. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After purchasing enough pennants to cut the dealer's per-unit price from $3 to 
$2, the Cameroonians strolled the last few blocks to the Bowl, passing a crowd 
of 150 Swedes who had hoisted their flag in a eucalyptus tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "5-0!" yelled one blond-haired, twentyish Swede. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, in favor of Cameroon!" replied Amos Bello, 47, who was garbed in the 
native robe of a tribal chief and a multicolored knit hat in the afternoon sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Bello, a train manager for the Cameroon Port Authority, had been unhappy with 
the difficult logistics of the morning but was smiling when he finally entered 
the Rose Bowl. "We made it here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the gate, the group met up with dozens of other Cameroon natives, including 
Solomon Tataw, the tribal chief of the village of Mamnyu. 
</P>
<P>
 Tataw, who wore a ceremonial feathered hat, a camera and what appeared to be a 
Turkish towel around his neck, said he is enjoying his stay in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were still a young man, I wouldn't like to go back home," said the 
chief, who left his three wives and seven children back in Cameroon. 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside, the Cameroonians were greeted with loud support from Egyptian and 
Scottish soccer fans. They took snapshots of each other with the smoggy San 
Gabriel Mountains in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 About 45 minutes later, the Hereafter fans were supplemented by boisterous 
Cameroonian students from American colleges -- as well as employees of a 
Cameroonian cement company -- who hoisted a flag and a large sign in 
Cameroonian colors saying "It's Milla Time!" -- referring not to beer but to 
soccer star Roger Milla.  
</P>
<P>
 At game time, the paint was melting from the Swedes' faces in the Pasadena 
sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
 During the tailgate party, they played soccer, listened to a tape of surfer 
music and occasionally broke into the ever-popular dog howls. The fare had been 
reduced to hot dogs and German potato salad because they had eaten all the 
Swedish food earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the Swedes began to march to the Rose Bowl. One carried a banner of a 
Swedish beer label. Another had a flag draped over his back. They passed other 
clusters of Swedes and exchanged high-fives. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the stadium, travel booking agent Rudi Schreiner sat in the midst of 
the chanting Cameroonians. He had bought a ticket from a scalper outside the 
stadium and the only hat he had been able to buy was one designating him as a 
fan of the Swedish team. He looked very much out of place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I bought the wrong hat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next two hours, each group got to celebrate twice as their teams 
fought to a 2-2 tie. But the festive mood dimmed at that result. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are disappointed," said Cameroonian Noel Seaha. "For us it is a defeat. If 
we won, we would be drinking and dancing until tomorrow. Now we will sleep and 
wait for Brazil." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a better team than them," echoed Christiansen of the Swedes. "We 
should have won." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Swedes set off to find a bar.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; JACKSON WON'T DECIDE UNTIL WINTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel left fielder Bo Jackson says that although he has pondered retirement at 
the season's conclusion, he probably will not finalize a decision until the 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politics have screwed this game up," Jackson said, "and I get sick of all the 
political bull. . . . You just get tired of it. If I do retire, I'll just be 
the bus driver for my kids each morning to school." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who had his artificial hip examined this week, was told by his doctor 
that his hip is functioning well and that he can continue to play baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need new brake shoes and new points," Jackson said, "and when I'm finished 
with baseball, I'll probably go in there and get a new set of wheels. But I 
feel good, and as long as I'm having fun, I'll keep playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who spent the last three seasons with the White Sox organization, 
thoroughly enjoyed his return visit to Chicago. He chatted with the left-field 
fans during his two starts, and one day even drove his motorcycle to the 
ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't leave Chicago with a sour taste in my mouth like I did Kansas City," 
he said. "It was a great relationship. And no matter what happens, I feel like 
I can never repay Herm (Schneider, the White Sox's trainer). I'll always 
appreciate what he did for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson left behind a present for Schneider before he left town. He delivered 
a case of Dom Perignon to Schneider's locker, leaving him to figure out where 
it came from. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Angel second baseman Kevin Flora, still having difficulty dealing with the 
death of his wife, was granted another leave of absence from triple-A 
Vancouver. Yet the Angels informed him that if he does not return by July, he 
will no longer be paid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think they want to bring this thing to a head and get him to play," 
said Bill Moore, Flora's agent. "They want to be fair, but they want to get his 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Flora, whose wife was killed April 22, 1993, has been working out daily and 
receiving counseling. Moore expects Flora to return in July, although now it 
appears unlikely that he'll be called up to the Angels before September. 
</P>
<P>
 Flora, whom the Angels were hoping would be their everyday second baseman this 
season, sat out missed most of last season and has not played regularly at 
Vancouver since mid-April. BOB NIGHTENGALE

BESCHEN COMES AWAY WITH SURFING VICTORY IN OCEANSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shane Beschen appeared relaxed going into the final heat of the Body Glove 
Oceanside surf contest, and even in the water, he was quiet. He seemed content 
to sit on his board and wait for the waves he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Beschen sat and listened as Rob Machado, Todd Holland and Kalani Robb took off 
on a series of smaller waves, scoring fives and a couple sixes on the judge's 
10-point scale. Beschen, a 22-year-old from San Clemente, listened as each 
surfer's position was announced, and at each time he was last. 
</P>
<P>
 At 30 minutes, the final heat is 10 minutes longer than the earlier heats and 
surfers score points on the best four waves instead of three. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was doing bad in the beginning but I knew I had time to wait for the bigger 
sets to come in," Beschen said. "Normally, I don't even want to take off on a 
wave unless I'm going to get at least a seven." 
</P>
<P>
 When the set came in, Beschen scored a high six and then added a 9.0 and a 
couple of eights. Now, with 10 minutes left in the heat, the others had to 
catch him. 
</P>
<P>
 Machado, a Carlsbad native who had the crowd support, recently won the Marui 
Pro in Japan and is second on the world tour. In the finals, he landed some 
eight-point waves but could not catch Beschen, who finished first. 
</P>
<P>
 Robb, a 17-year-old surfer from Hawaii, made the finals for the first time and 
finished third. A surfer who leads with his left foot like Machado, Robb has a 
similar style and quickness. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland, who lives in Florida but learned to surf on the North Carolina coast, 
finished fourth. Until Oceanside, he skipped the events on the national tour 
and focused on world tour events. His shaper, Gary Linden, lives in Oceanside, 
and Holland made the trip to pick up new boards as much as to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a great final," tour director Ian Cairns said. "Shane Beschen will 
be a world champ; Rob Machado is second right now and will be world champion 
someday; Todd Holland almost has been champion; and it's arguable that Kalani 
Robb, as he develops will be that good, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Cairns also said he was not surprised that Beschen won. "He's a great 
competitor. He wants it more (than the others). When he enters a contest, he 
enters to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Beschen admits his concentration came with experience. "I've definitely gone 
through all the stages of just wanting to get to the quarterfinals and then the 
semis. Now if I'm entered I want to win." 
</P>
<P>
 A top-16 surfer on the world championship tour, Beschen credits the man-on-man 
format of that tour with improving his performance on the Bud Surf Tour, the 
national qualifying tour whose format consists of four-man heats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wave selection is more critical in man-on-man surfing because you either win 
or lose. You can't come in second," Beschen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Noah Budroe of Huntington Beach and Richie Collins of Newport Beach advanced 
to the semifinals, where they lost to Machado and Holland. Chris Brown of Santa 
Barbara and Tim Curran, 16, from Florida, lost to Beschen and Robb. 
</P>
<P>
 Beschen plans to use most of the $4,000 he earned in the Oceanside event to 
finance a trip to the French territory of Reunion Island, the site of the next 
world tour event. After that, he plans to return home to compete in the Op Pro 
and the U.S. Open of Surfing, which run July 26-31 and then Aug. 2-7 in 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Oceanside bodyboarding competition, Brazilian Guilherme Tamega held off 
eight-time world champion Mike Stewart, Harry Antipala and Lanson Ronquillo to 
win the final heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first American event I've won," Tamega said. "I'm accustomed to 
these conditions though because it is like the beach break at home in Brazil." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, who splits his time between Hawaii and Anaheim, was disappointed in 
the outcome. "I just couldn't get any good open waves." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately the biggest set came in just as the bodyboarding final was 
ending. Conditions remained strong through the five-minute break before the 
surfers took the water for their final, faded at the beginning of their heat 
and returned for the final minutes of the contest.

WHAT IS IT ABOUT THOSE STACKABLE, WHACKABLE DISCS THAT HAS KIDS GOING . . . ; 
POG WILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL QUINTANILLA and JEANNINE STEIN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Depending on your age and your area code, you might be obsessed with Pogs, or 
blissfully ignorant of them. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend/fad/craze, which originated a couple of years ago with an elementary 
school teacher in Hawaii, crossed the Pacific and -- fueled by tournaments, 
corporate sponsors and an official world headquarters -- virtually consumed the 
grade- and middle-school crowd in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 While numerous schools there were banning Pogs, the stackable, whackable 
cardboard milk caps spread to pockets of 213, 310, 818 and 805, and Washington, 
Arizona, Texas, Florida and parts of the East Coast, picking up enemies -- some 
parents and school officials -- along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 But even though the discs are a hit with kids, people who make their living 
analyzing trends can't agree on how to characterize this phenomenon. Pogs, they 
say, are no Hula Hoops. At least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
 So what are they? A nuisance, if you listen to teachers and parents in Los 
Angeles. Like their brethren in Orange County, they are upset because the game 
has turned some children into savvy high rollers, betting jewelry, clothes and 
lunch money along with their milk caps. 
</P>
<P>
 Several L.A. schools have banned the game in the aftermath of fights, heated 
arguments and kids stealing the glossy discs from younger ones.  
</P>
<P>
 For the uninitiated, the Depression-era game is played with 
silver-dollar-sized cardboard milk bottle caps. The caps -- which cost from 10 
cents to $1 each -- are stacked either face-up or -down and then hit with a 
heavier, thicker disc called a "slammer" that goes for as much as $6. 
</P>
<P>
 The caps that land opposite-side-up are the player's to keep. In the Los 
Angeles area, numerous variations -- with such names as tornado, ABCs, 
crisscross, poison, rainbow, scorpion, outsiders and black magic -- have 
cropped up. 
</P>
<P>
 Pogs -- also known as Trovs, Hero Caps, SkyCaps and Tonx -- are decorated with 
the images of products, movie stars, athletes, comic book figures, deities, 
ninjas, ghouls, cars and cartoon characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months ago, the Costa Mesa-based World POG Federation co-sponsored the 
"Go Pog Wild & Rollerblade Crazy" event at Disneyland. On slate for the WPF is 
the Southern California Pog Championships at Knott's Berry Farm in September 
and a campaign in Canada with Coca-Cola and Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen anything like this since marbles," said Rick Mitchell, who 
manages All Sport Card in Rancho Penasquitos, about 15 miles north of San 
Diego. He said he is busy filling cap orders for stores in Texas, Utah, 
Washington and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ground zero for the discs is in the small town of Waialua on the Hawaiian 
island of Oahu. It was there a few years ago that teacher Blossom Galbiso 
taught her students a game she had grown up with. 
</P>
<P>
 "We called it 'milk covers' then," she said in a telephone interview. When she 
heard in the fall of 1992 that the game was spreading across Hawaii, she kept a 
chart tracking its migration. To date, the game has made its way not only to 
the Mainland but to Canada and Mexico. Soon she was getting 30 to 50 calls a 
day from people wanting to know where to buy the caps. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those callers was a Southern California entrepreneur who soon learned 
that a Hawaiian dairy began marketing POG -- which stands for passion 
fruit-orange-guava juice -- in bottles with cardboard caps 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Rypinski, founder and chairman emeritus of Armor All, is also president 
and CEO of the World POG Federation, which is helping fuel the frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Rypinski bought the POG trademark from the Haleakala Dairy in Maui in 1993 and 
has been running with it ever since. He has several licensing ventures in the 
works and wants to take Pogs to schools, both as a fund-raising device and an 
educational tool. "We've studied this carefully," he said, "and it's 
non-gender-specific. That's unique. And there is no intimidation factor when 
you play this game. It's just clean fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Irma Zandl, president of the Zandl Group, a New York-based youth market 
consulting company, called Pogs a fad, not a trend.  
</P>
<P>
 "These kinds of fads travel much in the same way that jokes do. They sort of 
end up crisscrossing the country and fads tend to work that same way," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It makes sense that the fad first landed on the West Coast -- and not anywhere 
else immediately -- because the caps came from Hawaii, a favorite vacation spot 
for Californians, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 The caps, she said, are like the Vanilla Ice of hip-hop culture, popular only 
with certain segments and ages of the population where they are distributed. 
"With fads, the hotter it burns, the quicker it burns out." 
</P>
<P>
 It has, however, caused trouble at some schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Diana Lorenz, principal of Mount Washington Elementary School in Los Angeles, 
decided to enforce a cap ban after she learned that some kids were selling them 
for more than $1 each. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was getting out of hand," she said, adding: "I don't have anything against 
the Pogs, but I found them educationally distracting." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, A.H. Glass, assistant principal at Nimitz Middle School in 
Southeast Los Angeles -- the second-largest junior high school in the country 
-- broadcast a no-Pog edict to the 3,600 students. His decision came soon after 
he discovered some pornographic caps a student had brought to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students were coming up to me to complain that someone had stolen or taken 
their caps. Other students were gambling with them. We had arguments. We had 
fights. Older students were threatening younger students. We decided to ban 
them on the basis of it being a form of gambling and a distraction on campus." 
</P>
<P>
 Glass said he noticed the disc phenomenon on his campus about five weeks ago. 
In the mornings he would break up groups of 40 to 50 players "hunched over like 
they were shooting dice." 
</P>
<P>
 But ban or no ban, the discs still manage to find their way into the pockets 
of some students at Nimitz. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben, 13, who wouldn't reveal his last name, pulled out a handful of Pogs and 
a couple of slammers from his baggy pockets to demonstrate the game one day 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't get me in trouble," he warned as students gathered around him on their 
knees to cheer him on against his opponent, Danny Acevedo, 14, an eighth-grader 
at Nimitz. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few rounds that included some fancy tricks, Ruben scooped up his caps, 
returned them to his pockets and slipped out of the room unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny said he started collecting his caps two months ago after his stepbrother 
showed him how the game was played. He now has more than 400 Pogs at home, 
which he purchased partly with the $3 daily allowance his mother gives him for 
lunch and snacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to win," he said. "I wanna win so bad that I get all hyper and 
everything." And sometimes he says he wants "to play so bad that I'll gamble." 
</P>
<P>
 The most he's won is $10 in one play. The most he's ever lost is $5. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny told his friends that "my mom says 'It's the devil's game.' She would 
prefer that I not spend my money on Pogs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Danny's house in Southeast Los Angeles, the Super Nintendo sits on top of a 
TV gathering dust because Danny is "outside all the time playing Pogs," said 
his mother, Miriam Rivera. She is concerned Danny will "become addicted" to 
gambling. "I'm scared that if he starts playing with money like this that he's 
going to like it and when he grows up he'll like gambling." 
</P>
<P>
 Dee Dee Urquhart, a West Hills mother, said her two boys, Kyle, 10, and 
Parker, 8, students at Welby Way Elementary in the San Fernando Valley, are Pog 
wild. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys spend their allowance, anywhere from $3 to $5 a week, on the caps. 
"My dad is the champion," said Parker, who adds that playing with the discs "is 
the only thing to do 'cause everything else is boring." 
</P>
<P>
 Urquhart said her boys have outgrown the Sega and Nintendo. "Now, they're on 
their hands and knees with their dad," she said, adding that she's had a talk 
with her children "about the gambling aspect of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 She is upset, though, with other parents who "don't know what these Pogs are 
all about. They'll buy their kids anything and then ignore what the kids are 
doing with the stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 And she agrees with Welby Way's ban on Pogs "because a lot of arguments are 
created over (them)." 
</P>
<P>
 Galbiso, who never dreamed her childhood pastime would explode on an 
international scale, said she's disappointed by schools that have banned the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that some of the most teachable moments are when you're having 
problems. When people fall down the stairs, do you take the stairs away? No, 
you make them safer or teach people to walk better. That can be used to a 
teacher's advantage," the 23-year teaching veteran said.

COMMITMENTS; 'GAME' REMAINS THE SAME -- EVEN IN CYBERSPACE; TECHNOLOGY: BY 
SIGNING ON TO COMPUTER SERVICES, WOMEN CAN MEET NEW FRIENDS. BUT JUST AS IN 
REAL LIFE, SOMETIMES THE ATTENTION IS UNWANTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From The Washington Post

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you are a woman, sometimes cyberspace can get ugly. Especially in those 
places that allow live interaction -- the theme "rooms" in America Online and 
CompuServe, the "Relay Chat" on the Internet and others -- women get a lot of 
attention, wanted or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Women learn that new "friends" appear quickly. Even a gender-neutral name 
brings on a nightly stream of abbreviated come-ons -- "m or f?" Are you male or 
female? 
</P>
<P>
 Some of this behavior can be chalked up to the large number of 14-year-old 
boys out there with hormonal surges. But there also seem to be grown-ups living 
out an extended adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been recent reports of sexual harassment -- and worse. In one 
publicized case, a Michigan man was arrested for allegedly "stalking" a woman 
who spurned him via E-mail. One message to her read: "This letter thing is the 
LEAST of the many things I could do to annoy you." Said the 29-year-old 
recipient: "It was very, very spooky." 
</P>
<P>
 Although verbal muggings, or "flames," are relatively rare, they give 
newcomers pause. Getting mugged in the real world doesn't happen that often, 
but knowing it happens at all makes us think twice before going out after 
midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, lots of women have no trouble holding their own in cyberspace, 
cheerfully lambasting the bozos. Still others welcome the more intriguing 
advances and use their modems to indulge in a libidinous escape. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also easy for men to find out how women are treated on-line: Just be one. 
Through a computer screen, nobody can see whether you have a Y chromosome. With 
the anonymity offered by most on-line services, users can build their own 
cyber-Tootsie personas.

COMMITMENTS; CAN THIS MARRIAGE BE SAVED?; HER ANGER IS A BOMB IN NEED OF 
DEFUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By By the Editors of Ladies' Home Journal 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jenny, 37, the mother of 6-year-old twins, can no longer pretend that her 
10-year marriage to Jim, a dedicated family physician, is just fine. And she's 
tired of hearing from everyone else in town how terrific he is. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim is hardly ever home. And he gets calls at all hours of the day or night. 
In the middle of dinner, if his partner phones, he's out the door to help," 
Jenny complains. 
</P>
<P>
 On the rare evenings when Jim is not on call, he buries himself in medical 
journals as soon as the boys are in bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny feels lonely, ignored and unimportant; the part-time job she found in 
the school library hardly fills the void. "I know I shouldn't feel this way. I 
don't know why I'm so unhappy in a marriage that other women envy," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim, 40, doesn't know why she is, either. "Do you think I enjoy being called 
away from my family in the middle of the night?" he asks. "It's my job." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim is tired of being yelled at by a wife he thinks should know how demanding 
his work really is: "Jenny stores up her hurts, then explodes. She thinks 
picking on me clears the air," Jim reports. But half the time, he can barely 
remember what transgression he's being accused of. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few months ago, Jim says, she chewed him out for being inattentive to 
her during her labor with the twins. "How can I defend myself for doing 
something that happened years ago, something I don't even remember?" he 
wonders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jenny, like many women whose husbands are in demanding jobs, has trouble 
honoring her own needs," says James W. Walkup Jr., former director of the 
Counseling Center of Southern Westchester, N.Y.  
</P>
<P>
 She thinks she's not entitled to feel the way she does because, after all, Jim 
isn't out drinking with the guys or loafing on the couch -- he's saving lives. 
But even though her frustrations are justified, Jenny has to learn to keep them 
from consuming her. The trouble is, like many of us, she doesn't even realize 
she is angry until she reaches the kindling point. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you or your spouse, like Jenny, have difficulty recognizing when you're 
angry? Try these approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Monitor your behavior for one week. Keep a chart or jot notes on a 
calendar. At whom did you get angry -- your spouse, your kids, your boss, your 
mother -- and why? Can you determine any patterns in what made you so upset? 
Are any situations or topics guaranteed to set you off? Write them down. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Concentrate on what your body feels like at these times: Does your stomach 
churn or your heart race? Do you feel a tightening in your temples, neck or 
back? Learn to recognize your body's reactions to anger. Don't ignore these 
messages and pray they'll go away. Jenny is often unaware that she is being 
hostile to Jim. Getting in touch with her anger will help her short-circuit her 
sarcastic remarks and even defuse arguments before they rage out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 3. State to your partner what you feel when you feel it. Without being 
defensive, demeaning or blaming, talk to your partner so he or she not only 
hears you but is motivated to change.

COMMITMENTS; PARTY OF ONE; WANT A TASTE OF THE SINGLE LIFE? TRY TUNA,

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm just your basic single chick. My married friends suspect this means 
sex-packed nights and cereal dinners. But by the looks of Jerry Seinfeld's TV 
kitchen, I'm not the only one who eats Shredded Wheat for supper. 
</P>
<P>
 And nobody thinks Jerry's a lazy slob, right? We are simply among a silent 
majority of people who eat way differently when alone. 
</P>
<P>
 When we're with company, we feel compelled to eat meals as if we're dressing 
up. All the food must form an ensemble -- main course, accessorized by salad 
and bread. Don't clash with the side dishes! All must end with dessert and 
espresso. When was the last time you made yourself a cake and a pot of coffee 
after dinner? 
</P>
<P>
 The story is different when dining is Nancy, party of one. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent night I got home from the gym about 8 and found myself with a 
barren refrigerator. But my totally a la carte dinner turned out well, I 
thought: marinated artichoke hearts and sun-dried tomatoes from the jar, yogurt 
and an apple. Dirty dish count: one spoon. Nothing like that kind of 
satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, right," my friend Tim said the next morning. "Like any of that kind of 
food would be in a guy's refrigerator. . . . We usually have stuff that has a 
long shelf life or stuff that in and of itself wouldn't be a food item, but 
could be added to other food items. And, of course, beer. " 
</P>
<P>
 I can see inside his Amana now, I told him: jars of salsa and green olives 
stuffed with pearl onions and Knott's Berry Farm gift-package jam, circa 1985, 
with a bag of potatoes that are growing roots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right on the olives. Sub in jalapenos for salsa, and I threw out the jam 
after the sugar crystallized around the lid. But I have carrots with root hair 
longer than yours," he corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 This sounds familiar. I've had ex-boyfriends who substituted water or orange 
juice for milk on their Rice Krispies rather than run to the store. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent case of this occurred earlier this month on vacation in the 
alleged capital of fine food, France. My boyfriend opened the refrigerator in 
our Loire Valley apartment and realized we were out of milk. "You know," he 
said, "it's too bad you turned in that food column already, because I'm about 
to eat a bowl of Frosties with yogurt on top." 
</P>
<P>
 (Imagine the dinner party at which you ate only what kids would subsist on if 
allowed: Lucky Charms, Popsicles, Twinkies, bologna slices and Kool-Aid. Then 
we could chase each other around the yard with squirt guns.) 
</P>
<P>
 The other day I tested my premise by asking via office E-mail, "What do you 
eat when you're alone?" I knew within minutes I was onto something. I got even 
more revelations after my confessions of scooping pesto sauce, cold, with bread 
sticks out of the jar for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ditto tuna," said a friend. "Or anything handy dunked manually into 
mayonnaise or salad dressing bottles. I cannot buy my favorite cereals because 
I eat them out of the box -- in one night. I have to buy second or third 
choices. Bran is good. You don't eat bran out of the box." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people wanted clarification -- such as what category of solo food I 
meant. "When I'm home alone watching TV?" asked one guy I'll call George to 
protect any future love life. "Or what I like to cook? Or buy at restaurants?" 
</P>
<P>
 Any of the above, I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey," he said, "it got so bad at my place last week that I sat with the 
peanut butter jar and forked it into my mouth. I was too lazy to go out and buy 
something, the cupboards were bare but, hey, the peanut butter was there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't forget ambience. You need this," George added. "You see, guys when they 
eat certain foods pay respect to it. With a steak, I actually may sit at a 
table. In clothes. It's a ritual. With junk food, it's grubby drawers, one foot 
hooked over the arm of the chair." 
</P>
<P>
 In a confessional tone, my editor friend Jim admitted that recently he had 
gone by himself to Hof's Hut and had nothing else for dinner but a piece of 
strawberry pie fit for a heifer. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, Jim, but that would constitute small canned potatoes for a person 
coming from my family. On the rare occasions when my father would cook for 
himself, his idea of chow was an appetizer of canned Vienna sausages (is there 
such a thing as uncanned?) and a main course of the following fry-pan mixture: 
canned pork and beans, canned corned beef hash and, when it was available, 
Spam. Anything leftover and of questionable expiration date in the refrigerator 
would be tossed in too. 
</P>
<P>
 As he gets older, his taste is improving and he's cut down on the labor. Now, 
he eats Popsicles and ice cream all day.

O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW; JAMES TAYLOR HAS FRIENDS IF NOT FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once he was the Walking Man. Now you might peg James Taylor by one of the more 
recent song titles on his set list Saturday night at Irvine Meadows: "The 
Frozen Man." 
</P>
<P>
 But not frozen in bearing. In his low-key way, the smiling, ever-gracious 
Taylor had no problem establishing a warm connection with his fans. And 
certainly not frozen out of the marketplace. At 46, this epitome of the early 
'70s introspective singer-songwriter movement remains a hot concert draw. At 
Irvine, the 15,000-capacity house was virtually packed. 
</P>
<P>
 What's frozen, and has been since early in his career, is Taylor's artistic 
development. Ideally, a performer's path can take new directions even as he or 
she moves through middle age. Taylor doesn't seem interested in any such 
shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 His fans evidently don't mind. Taylor's voice remains as pleasing as ever, 
with its gentle, reedy appeal and comfortable hangdog quality. He plays most of 
the old favorites and usually renders them much as he originally recorded them. 
His backing band is a nine-piece ensemble with the skills to bring recording 
studio precision to the concert stage. 
</P>
<P>
 This conservative approach has its practical advantages if you consider the 
commercial fate of some of the other noted singer-songwriters of Taylor's 
generation. 
</P>

 Joni Mitchell took a drastic leap into the avant-garde during the late '70s 
and her mass following dwindled, never to return. Jackson Browne became 
political and stumbled over his own soapbox. Cat Stevens found religion. So did 
Van Morrison, who, though he didn't feel compelled to sacrifice his art on the 
altar of faith, alienated a whole bunch of "Moondance" and "Tupelo Honey" fans 
as he journeyed further and further into the mystic.

 Neil Young turned down his big post-"Harvest" chance to be a sensitive 
troubadour with a huge following because he was too fond of making a big, noisy 
mess. Bob Dylan became known for willfully unpredictable performances that 
could make classic songs unrecognizable, and his draw fell off as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor has gone on as always, putting out a craftsmanlike new album every 
three or four years over the past decade and a half. "The Frozen Man" was drawn 
from his last studio release, "New Moon Shine" (1991). It is a wry, fanciful 
tale about a 19th-Century mariner who gets frozen in seawater when his ship 
goes down in the Arctic, only to be thawed out and revived more than 100 years 
later. Metaphorically, it fits in with the essential theme of Taylor's career 
-- the search for warmth following chilling exposure to bad emotional weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, a lot of people can still relate to that theme, and many appreciate 
the comforting tone Taylor takes in conveying it. There's nothing wrong with 
offering comfort, but it would have been better if Taylor could also have 
mustered contrasting moments that were genuinely, disturbingly dramatic, or 
more rough-hewn and unruly. 
</P>
<P>
 At Irvine Meadows, he played a solid opening hour that began with nods to 
gospel and R&B influences in his own "Lo and Behold" and a laid-back but 
reasonably funky take on Chuck Berry's "Promised Land." The headlong Berry 
chug-a-lug riffing was replaced by the same easy-rolling New Orleans 
slip-and-slide groove that Little Feat used for "Dixie Chicken." 
</P>
<P>
 "Your Smiling Face," one of Taylor's brightest and most affirmative songs, got 
the biggest ovation, but his most striking performance was "Country Road." 
Rather than play it just like the record, Taylor came up with a well-wrought 
instrumental intro in which his rippling acoustic guitar danced a while with 
Jimmy Johnson's trebly bass. The song eventually shifted from melancholy to 
hopefulness with soul-style vocal vamps and an elegant but sinewy band 
accompaniment that avoided the slickness that would creep in from time to time 
during the show.  
</P>
<P>
 Taylor finished his first set nicely with a simple, just-so rendition of the 
lullaby "Sweet Baby James," then took a 25-minute intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During the second half, Taylor tried to find a higher gear, but the show 
meandered uneventfully. A second Chuck Berry song, "Memphis," had all the fire 
and humor taken out of it in a doleful, slow-moving arrangement. A neutered 
version of Buddy Holly's "Not Fade Away" lacked urgency and propulsion, while 
Taylor tinkered with the lyrics in a way that turned it from a desperate bid to 
win a romantic cause into something entirely more carefree and easygoing. 
Holly's anguished "My love is bigger than a Cadillac/I try to show it but you 
drive me back" became the lovey-dovey "I drive you and you drive me back." A 
run through Eddie Cochran's "Summertime Blues" lacked the requisite wildness. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as Taylor finished "You've Got a Friend," significant numbers in the 
house turned into walking men and women, even though there was still a good 
deal of music yet to come. The last half hour of the concert was marked by an 
exodus to the parking lot reminiscent of Dodger Stadium after the seventh 
inning. Not even "Fire and Rain" could halt the defections. Maybe the fans 
wouldn't be so eager to get a head start if they knew Taylor had some fresh 
twists and surprises in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor performs Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday at the 
Universal Amphitheatre, 100 Universal City Plaza, Universal City, 8:15 p.m. 
$24.50 to $40, (818) 980-9421.

MUSIC REVIEW; MIXED PROGRAM CONCLUDES SOUTHWEST CHAMBER SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southwest Chamber Music Society has come a long way in its first eight 
seasons, which ended with twin events over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization's pool of splendid Southern California players remains secure 
-- clearly, gifted musicians working in the vineyards of commerce appreciate 
opportunities to make art as often as possible -- its standards high, its 
programs provocative. 
</P>
<P>
 At the first of these two closing concerts, Friday night at Chapman University 
in Orange (repeated in Pasadena, Saturday), the program offered welcome 
variety: Halsey Stevens' String Trio (1959); a group of Purcell songs 
accompanied by lute and Baroque cello; Brahms' autumnal but hot-blooded String 
Quintet, Opus 111. 
</P>
<P>
 This agenda achieved its climax, naturally, in Brahms' ever-wondrous G-major 
Quintet, given by violinists Peter Marsh and Annie Chalex, violists Jan Karlin 
and Richard Elegino and cellist Roger Lebow a propulsive yet spacious 
continuity and bright overview filled out with telling details. 
</P>
<P>
 Brahms' earthy passions and spiritual subtexts infuse all movements of this 
masterpiece, and these players re-created and integrated both aspects, with 
brilliant playing all around. 
</P>
<P>
 In Stevens' touching and compact Trio -- a work of neo-Classic terseness that 
the late composer said could be played by either winds or strings -- similar 
strengths were achieved by Marsh, Karlin and Lebow, an an affectionate revival. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a mid-performance string-breaking on James Tyler's lute and a number 
of unclarified consonants in soprano Mary Rawcliffe's enunciation, a 
quarter-hour of Purcell songs at mid-program nevertheless provided pleasure and 
contrast between the Stevens and Brahms works. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Tueller was the articulate cellist in these four songs.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; BEING SO NEAR MEANS BEING FAR FROM ARTISTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Pornography," according to one of Joseph Campbell's TV lectures, was James 
Joyce's term for art that exists primarily to advance a cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce's terminology was idiosyncratic and extreme, but it serves a useful 
warning. When artists start assuming that the proper object of their work is 
the betterment of humanity, that Joycean sneer might remind them that it's hard 
enough just to achieve an honest understanding and vivid rendering of some 
fragment of human experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Holly Near probably would turn redder than her flowing hair at being pegged a 
pornographer, regardless how the term is being recoined. But by Joyce's lights, 
pornography is what she often sells. 
</P>
<P>
 The 45-year-old singer's career has been practically inseparable from her 
causes. She has used her artist's platform to raise money for and proclaim the 
rightness of the various social struggles on her agenda, all of them typically 
identified with the political left. 
</P>
<P>
 Near's show Friday night at the Coach House drew about 200 of the faithful, 
with support for pacifism, environmentalism, economic and racial justice, 
women's rights and the moral legitimacy of gay and lesbian sexuality being the 
primary articles of faith.  
</P>
<P>
 As a rally designed to reaffirm that faith and rekindle spirits for the 
ongoing struggle, the concert was effective. In terms of artistry, as measured 
by the singer's ability and command and the vividness of her material, it was a 
pretty ho-hum 1 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like Judy Collins before her, Near started out as a pure folkie during the 
1970s and has branched into Broadway material and cabaret songs (along the way 
she has released a steady stream of albums on her own Northern California 
label, Redwood Records, and found a niche in the public eye, and in the music 
market, as one of the first women in pop to be a declared lesbian). But Near's 
voice is cut-rate contrasted with the purity of a Collins. It's a pleasant 
enough but basically unremarkable instrument that lacks the presence or 
fullness to serve as an attraction by itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of singers do involving work without a great set of pipes by putting a 
distinctive spin on strong material. Near's offerings were too often flat and 
obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 A few songs, though, had some zip and spice. 
</P>
<P>
 One was a wry, breezy depiction of women playing the dating game (with other 
women), "Nothing Short of a Perfect Night Will Do." A rendition of "Soon It's 
Gonna Rain," from "The Fantasticks," started with a becoming fragility and 
intimacy, then kicked up the intensity, with Near's longtime accompanist, 
pianist John Bucchino, invigorating it with a burst of robust, swinging rhythm. 
A similar tactic worked in a medley of two more chestnuts from the Broadway 
tradition, "Let's Face the Music and Dance" and "I Could Have Danced All 
Night." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the rest was right-minded (assuming you're with Near politically, and 
this predominantly female audience clearly was) but downright dull. Historical 
grounding lent some color and interest to a Charlie King composition holding 
out the executed Massachusetts anarchists, Sacco and Vanzetti, as martyrs in 
the march to economic equality. 
</P>
<P>
 Near was forceful delivering a dark, surging song honoring Harriet Tubman, 
heroine of the underground railroad that conducted fleeing slaves to freedom 
before the Civil War. But the simplistic, slogan-heavy "Great Peace March" was 
so lacking in dimension or poetry that it came off as "Up With People" for 
lefties. It got one of the evening's biggest ovations.  
</P>
<P>
 Such declarations may swell the already-converted breast, but the higher 
artistry lies in songs that offer pertinent, tellingly detailed stories rather 
than baldly advising us how to aspire and what to think. Stevie Wonder's 
"Living for the City" doesn't contain a line that says, "racism is evil and we 
must stop it." It takes you to the movies and lets you draw your own 
conclusions about what you've witnessed. Tracy Chapman's "Fast Car" doesn't 
deliver a speech about how poverty can destroy dreams; it puts you inside the 
struggling dreamer's head. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Near had the sense to keep between-songs speechifying to a minimum. For the 
most part, her tone was lightly humorous or familiarly anecdotal. She alluded 
indirectly to the O.J. Simpson saga as she introduced a fanciful song about a 
woman in the Old West taking violent measures to defend herself from oppressive 
men. Near emphasized that her intention wasn't to judge the case but to point 
to the possibility of saner outcomes for lives shadowed by domestic violence: 
"'It's something that can be healed if we seek help." 
</P>
<P>
 In something of a summation near the end, the singer defined cynics as those 
who falsely expect progress to be quick and easy, then fall into bitter 
disillusionment when things don't magically improve. Instead, she said, it's 
imperative to push on with "brave and small acts of kindness," always keeping 
in mind that isolated grace notes somehow, over time, can become part of a 
chorus for change. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the most entrenched cynic could fail to nod assent to that. The problem 
with Near's show was that, in her eagerness to reassure and reinvigorate her 
audience, she failed to compellingly portray the inward struggle between hope 
and doubt that afflicts any sentient soul. 
</P>
<P>
 She does give doubt its due on her album "Sky Dances," in which the prevailing 
mood is somber, chastened and yearning. In concert, those complexities were 
smoothed over or ignored. Near provided a tonic for the troops, but that made 
for a dull evening out for anyone not already enlisted.

JAZZ REVIEW; CHARLES OWENS PROVES HE'S IN TUNE WITH A VARIETY OF SOUNDS AND 
STYLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Europe's loss was our gain when promoters over there canceled an appearance by 
the Duke Ellington Orchestra. (Europe's shrinking summer concert scene has left 
many American musicians idling at home this season.) 
</P>
<P>
 Among the band members who wouldn't be going abroad was Charles Owens. 
Instead, the well-traveled saxophonist took his newfound free time to book 
himself into System M on Saturday as part of a trio. 
</P>
<P>
 The show was a comprehensive overview of Owens' talents and dues-paying 
history. Unlike his April appearance, in which he celebrated the Duke's 
birthday with an all-Ellington program, the saxophonist used the revered 
bandleader as a touchstone, only striking up "In a Sentimental Mood" in the 
first set and "C-Jam Blues" in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 But the treatment of these Ellington chestnuts was anything but traditional. 
In fact, the entire program reflected Owens' experience working both sides of 
the fence. He has not only played traditional music with the Ellington 
orchestra (directed by Mercer Ellington) and Jimmie and Jeanie Cheatham's Sweet 
Baby Blues Band, he has explored new sounds with the likes of pianist Horace 
Tapscott and flutist James Newton, as well as spending time with bluesman John 
Mayall and genre-buster Frank Zappa. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the reasons for Owens' stimulating mix of traditional and out-jazz 
styles this night was due to the makeup of his backing duo. Tapscott veteran 
Roberto Miranda played bass, replacing usual Owen's sideman Louis Large, and 
drummer Don Littleton sat in for percussionist Donald Dean.  
</P>
<P>
 Both men favor the avant-garde side of their craft, witnessed by their 
appearance earlier in the week in Santa Monica at the Alligator Lounge's New 
Music Monday series with an on-the-edge combo led by pianist Wayne Peet that 
included forward-thinking guitarist Nels Cline. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So it was no surprise that "In a Sentimental Mood" developed into a 
consideration of more complex emotions as Owens bared his soul with swirling 
tenor figures and high-register cries. Miranda struck an Eastern approach 
during his solo, droning on a single tone while playing a string of second 
notes above it. The saxophonist re-entered the fray, this time with both 
sidemen sitting out, exploring a realm far distant from Ellington's original 
piece before slipping back into its familiar theme. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellington wasn't the only composer whose compositions were stretched to the 
limit. Mongo Santamaria's "Afro Blue" (Owens spent time in the Afro-Cuban 
percussionist's ensemble in the early '70s) was presented in a slow, Middle 
Eastern-flavored tempo before Miranda and Littleton moved to congas to give the 
piece a rippling, African feel.  
</P>
<P>
 On Miles Davis' "All Blues," Owens delivered a loose interpretation of the 
tune before negotiating a demanding solo. "Body and Soul" built dynamically 
into a free-form close with Miranda picking the strings of his upright at a 
furious pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Miranda is among the most animated acoustic bassist in Southern 
California,moving quickly through melodic double stops, climbing to his 
instrument's upper range like a kid scrambling in a tree, then initiating a 
series of Spanish-flavored chordal strums that sound as if they came from a 
guitar. Left to his own devices, the bassist soloed without end, stringing 
together one creative idea after another in a never-ending cascade of ideas, 
before Owens would whistle his improv to a close. 
</P>
<P>
 Littleton is equally dynamic, utilizing the sides of his drums and the cymbal 
supports to embellish his sound. At one point during "All Blues," he created a 
varied improvisation utilizing only his tom-tom while Miranda paced him on 
congas and Owens kept time with a cowbell. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on view was Owens the composer in a Latin-tinged piece titled "E.T.," a 
number that found him creating light dance figures on flute. 
</P>
<P>
 That Owens, who plays the stylish Pine Avenue venue on an infrequent basis, is 
one of the most utilitarian wind players on the scene was more than apparent at 
this performance. Despite the depth of his talent, he's also one of the area's 
most underappreciated musicians. Catching his show should be on any jazz fan's 
must-see list.

ART REVIEW; MOSES, PRICE SHARE A PAST AND A SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Beat Generation revival is afoot so it's entirely apt that two grizzled 
veterans of that era should be showing their art together. Ed Moses and Ken 
Price share history going back to the late '50s at the legendary Ferus Gallery. 
They also stand out as individualists among nonconformists. 
</P>
<P>
 Price was nurtured in the womb of a revolutionary class taught at Otis Art 
Institute by ceramic sculptor Peter Voulkos. It grafted the spontaneity of 
Abstract Expressionism to that of Japanese raku ware. As a result, the craft of 
potting was promoted to the status of sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a gifted draftsman and potentially brilliant painter, Price has 
remained an obdurate clay artist. Saying what kind is a tougher nut. He has 
made everything from hostile eggs to turtle cups and ironic curios in the 
accents of Mexican American Southwestern vernacular art. Just when you think 
you might get by calling him a Pop Primitivist or a Folk Aristocrat he comes up 
with a new oxymoron that deconstructs definition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The present gaggle of about 10 works, showing at the L.A. Louver Gallery, are 
abstractions with strong hints of expressive content. Some are lumpy and 
organic-like fossilized root balls. The colors of pieces like "True Blue" catch 
light in extraordinary ways. They radiate a nebulous glow. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, faceted works are sophisticated and slightly flashy as if 
thinking of Art Deco Cubism. Predominantly a suave matte black with flashes of 
green and red, the largest appears fairly narrow in depth until you peek around 
the back to encounter a tapering rectangle that puts you in mind of the bump on 
the rear of those television sets designed to look slender when they are as 
clunky as the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 One motif common to both sets seems significant. Works are notched in such 
fashion as to suggest a ledge high atop a cliff. Small black rectangles or 
silhouettes of cubes on the abutted vertical will do for entrances to very 
domesticated caves. Portals are so black as to appear painted on the surface. 
They are, in reality, holes. Ah, shallows that are deep. Open portals that 
appear closed. It's all very Zen and mordantly witty. 
</P>
<P>
 Moses has spent a long career on a quest through the labyrinth of classical 
modernist abstraction. He ran it through the sensibility unique to himself and 
L.A. art, its craziness, love of craft and urge to hybridize. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year he made an astonishing summary in a group of works that melded the 
primitivism of Lascaux with that of the graffiti writers. They achieved the 
impossible dream of combining figurative imagery and abstraction, absolute 
spontaneity and complete technical control. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the kind of feat that puts a fellow in the awkward position of being his 
own toughest competition. Never capable of settling into a trademark manner, 
Moses has dealt with this dilemma through understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 Called "Frontals and Reversals," new works echo the dribbles and earth tones 
of the previous bunch but look like blown-up sections turned backward. Staining 
soaks through, covered with clear acrylic that sometimes gives images the 
problematical appearance of large prints under glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures are now suggested within abstract shapes. "Revere Ome Number 1" has 
intense physical richness and a hint of hanging female torsos. By contrast "Ome 
Bu Number 1" is a sheet of thinly stained plywood evoking landscape. "Revere 
Dug Number 4" has rich rivers of acrylic blobs that suggest a microscopic inner 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Every painting points provocatively in another direction, to a new idea. They 
play hob with the conventional show-biz notion that the next movie has to be a 
bigger hit than the last one. For an artist like Ed Moses, it's the quest that 
counts. 
</P>
<P>
 * L.A. Louver Gallery, 55 N. Venice Blvd. and 77 Market St., Venice; through 
July 30, closed Mondays, (310) 822-4955.

SEASON OF HOPE; A LOOK AT THE FUTURE THROUGH LA QUINTA'S STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sea gulls gather like storm clouds in the sky above La Quinta High School's 
quad, circling and shrieking in anticipation of lunchtime leftovers. 
</P>
<P>
 You could set your watch by their arrival here 7 1/2 miles from the ocean, on 
a tidy little campus where surfers and brains and jocks gather and mostly get 
along. 
</P>
<P>
 Snoop Doggy Dogg's rap ends. With the bell, a thousand students scatter toward 
combo lockers, classrooms, their future. 
</P>
<P>
 So much is different in high school -- this school -- from 17 years ago when I 
was a student. Starting a freshman with braces and class vice president and 
ending up a homecoming queen nominee and class ditcher, I was as twisted up as 
any teen-ager over all the usual romantic and academic crises and terminal 
boredom. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody worried then about a classmate in civics drawing down on them from a 
backpack. Nobody worried about AIDS or tuberculosis. We didn't have a shooting 
in the parking lot. We did have a drunk driver who fatally plowed into the 
parking lot's fence. We had more smoking and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1970s, the student population was vastly white, with only 79 of 
2,000 kids of Asian or Pacific Island descent -- and they were primarily 
Japanese American kids whose families farmed strawberries one could still buy 
from the fields. Last year, filmmaker Oliver Stone's company conducted open 
casting calls out of the La Quinta cafeteria for his Vietnam movie, "Heaven and 
Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a very different place, La Quinta. 
</P>
<P>
 Family income levels have dropped. Only five students got free lunches when I 
attended; today 40% of the campus population does. Test scores have gone up. 
Enrollment has declined; so have electives such as metal shop. Students now 
complain that they can't enroll in more classes in a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Changing values and cultures are shifting much of what was high school 
tradition. Fewer than 40 class rings sold this year. Nobody wants to work on 
the yearbook anymore. For all the concern over teen sex, couple-dating 
sometimes seems as outdated as Ken and Barbie. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways it might be a hint of what's in store for Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the image lingers of bedrock white Orange County, 17 years ago it was 
even more so: 86% of the people living here were white. Today, the 2.4 million 
population -- dramatically affected by an infusion of immigrants and a changing 
economy -- includes 23% Latinos and 10% Asian and Pacific Islanders. In the 
high schools alone, the numbers rise to 35% and 13%. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to take a snapshot of ordinary teen-age life in this rapidly changing 
world, we spent most of the school year at La Quinta High School. Maybe, we 
thought, we might also catch a glimpse of our own future. 
</P>
<P>
 Here at La Quinta, where 27 languages are spoken, where dark hair and distant 
relatives are the norm, the so-called minority is the majority, and diversity 
and multiculturalism are not talked to death but lived out every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about time Americans realize we are part of the whole world," world 
history teacher Rita Corpin remarked one day outside her classroom. "Kids at La 
Quinta get that every day." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We start with fall, that season of beginnings and possibilities on a campus 
where students are more likely to feel hopeful about their future, and about 
themselves. Their dreams for big romances and small waists haven't yet faded 
like summer tans. 
</P>
<P>
 By October, it seems, the big news off campus is La Quinta's TB scare. After 
it becomes public that a 16-year-old student is still contagious with the 
disease, screenings are expanded to the entire campus. Headlines go on and on 
about the scare. Teachers and administrators fret that the bad news will 
discourage parents once open enrollment commenced. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials monitor the situation and hold meetings to arm teachers with 
facts and assuage fears. 
</P>
<P>
 For La Quinta students, it is one big yawn. 
</P>
<P>
 At weekly appointments, students who had tested positive for TB trudge from 
class to Nurse Sheryl Reyes' office, where they line up for their mandatory 
medication and then return to their desks.

 In Barbara Henry's art class one day, a girl is called to the nurse's office 
to a few chants of "TB, TB." But everyone, including the girl, laughs. There is 
not much obsessing about TB and, like AIDS, maybe it is just teen-age denial. 
But the kids talk more about the news coverage of TB -- they think it's 
sensationalized -- than about who has it on campus.

 Marching band member Amber McCammack, all school spirit and freckle-faced 
innocence, was a mother by her junior year. 
</P>
<P>
 One day after "narc watch," which involves her standing guard outside the 
girls bathroom while her friends smoke inside, she welcomes me to campus and 
wonders why I'm here. She agrees to meet later for a chat. 
</P>
<P>
 What is it like now to get through high school?, I ask. Over a banana split 
after school that day, she licks chocolate off her spoon and talks about things 
so private and painful it is hard not to wince. 
</P>
<P>
 Amber, 17, freely dissects why she thinks she had herself a baby. As she does 
this she is such a collision of girl and woman, cynical wit and crushing 
vulnerabilities. Her father died when she was 3; her mother then married a man 
Amber did not like. She thinks she clings to her boyfriend for the male 
protection she was denied. 
</P>
<P>
 Her grades suffered after her 16th birthday, when she learned she was 
pregnant. Her family was, of course, not pleased, she says. She says she never 
considered abortion. She felt oddly admired by other girls for seeing the 
pregnancy through. "They told me, 'I could never. I would just get rid of it.' 
They felt the disappointment of their parents would be worse than anything else 
that could happen to them." 
</P>
<P>
 She jokes that the one class she has done especially well at -- besides band, 
of course -- has been Life Sciences, specifically the chapter on reproduction.

 The excitement of homecoming is in the air -- or is it just a free period for 
a gym assembly where everyone gets to yell and show school spirit and sport the 
Aztec blue and gold? The script for this ritual brings alumni back to the big 
football game and a frilly-dressed queen to be crowned at half-time. 
</P>
<P>
 In looking at the football game program, I realize that the four princesses 
were born the year before I graduated. Ouch! Princess Aileen Rose has a 2.0 GPA 
and these plans: "Go to a two-year college, then to a four-year. Get married 
and have three kids (one girl, two boys). Go bungee-jumping." 
</P>
<P>
 Princess Mina Nguyen has a 4.1 GPA and four favorite teachers. Her plans? 
"Harvard and major in law, international relations and political science." 
</P>
<P>
 That old chestnut, football, has taken a hit on this campus with the changing 
student population. Asian-born kids generally don't have the size and years of 
practice in Pop Warner that past graduates had, coaches say, and their parents 
largely resist any activity that might detract from schoolwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Success, the coaches say, can no longer be strictly defined by winning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're better because of it," Jim Perry, athletic director and basketball 
coach, says one day after school in the gym, where expandable bleachers are 
tucked beneath the gray Aztec Empire painted on a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 In his striped warm-up suit the coach saunters along the sidelines as young 
boys run up and down the court. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the start of Perry's 13th year as a teacher and coach, and he has 
changed as radically and surely as have his teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches get as personally involved with their students' future as anyone on 
campus. They cajole students to stay out of trouble; they needle them about 
schoolwork; they nag them to kick butt for the greater good of their team; they 
referee family battles, they size up a kid's commitment and character and vest 
his future if deemed. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry has attended weddings and birthday parties and other milestones of his 
long grown-up charges. He is that kind of guy. 
</P>
<P>
 At some point after foreign students became a sizable presence in the school's 
sports programs, Perry took a year off "to regroup and rethink" -- to decide 
whether he could go on coaching. His conflicts reflect much of how other 
teachers and students have adapted to their changing world. 
</P>
<P>
 He visited campuses where friends of his coached, places such as Alhambra High 
School, where there is "a huge Chinese population going through the same thing" 
in athletics. Same thing in Wichita, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
 He helped a friend teach basketball at a Mexican clinic where they had not 
much more than a hoop in the village common. He rediscovered what it was like 
to share the pure love of a game and, he says, "the true meaning of teaching: 
the commitment to the value of kids doing the best they can," no matter how 
many jump shots they missed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really changed me personally," he says as the players wander toward the 
locker room, "and I think we do a better job now." 
</P>
<P>
 Being as close as he is to a lot of the students and former students who 
return as assistant coaches, Perry watches the nuance of student relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been racial tensions over the years," Perry says, "but they tend 
to be between Hispanics and Asians rather than with whites, because the whites 
are such a minority here. It's over stuff like culture, language, 'why do you 
think I'm different?', stuff like that." 
</P>
<P>
 More subtle social problems play out on campus as well, Perry and other 
teachers say, things like how females are viewed in their culture versus their 
standing in America. 
</P>
<P>
 The backgrounds of many of the kids born in Vietnam are sometimes stunning, he 
says, when you think about what they bring to school with them mentally. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids have had members of their families involved in guerrilla 
activities; they've been floating in the South China Sea on a rickety boat for 
three to five weeks; they've seen people dumped overboard, they've watched 
pirates kill people." Perry shakes his head. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a different kind of lost youth than gang bloodshed, but it is nonetheless 
innocence lost to violence.

<P>
 It's 9 a.m. Monday, and Rita Corpin's world history honors class is under way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just starting the Middle Ages," she says, as a video on what it's like 
to live in a castle plays. No big surprise here. Some kids are yawning with 
their heads down in the dark. Corpin is unfazed. She's been teaching here three 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The class is an interesting microcosm on some days. One of the things Corpin 
tells her students is that she is impressed that they know more than one 
language. But shortly after she noticed groups of students speaking languages 
other than English in class, she saw a problem emerging. If she felt left out 
and excluded, how must other students feel? 
</P>
<P>
 "I require everyone to speak English in class, because that puts down walls, 
and I tell them, 'We need to speak a universal language so we can all 
communicate and understand each other.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Some days Corpin has her students group off by color of their clothes, or by 
first letter of their name. One day, she had her students line up by country of 
birth. America was a small group -- six out of about 30. "The rest were born in 
Pakistan, Iran, Vietnam, Romania, all around the world." Corpin let her own 
observation sink in. "There may be riots and problems in L.A., but it's working 
here, the melting pot. And it's not a class thing either." 
</P>
<P>
 World history in Corpin's class is delivered with a cultural point of view -- 
not just a drone of dates and names but the music, foods, religions, values, 
social welfare system, art and literature, men's and women's roles and 
economics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got the United Nations on this campus, and I think its great," Corpin 
says with pride. 
</P>
<P>
 But do the kids? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a good question. I think there's a lot more understanding. At first I 
felt there were walls. One thing I have noticed: There has been some white 
flight, but the students here now -- by and large get along very well, because 
we see that there's understanding and respect." 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to remember, students are young and open-minded. Students are very 
open to change, and very positive. When students break into study groups, you 
don't see big breaches between races. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now guys and girls in the same group, that ' s an even rougher mix," she says 
with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>

 Flames are devouring entire neighborhoods in Laguna Beach and Malibu and 
Sierra Madre, monopolizing television news for days. There is not a peep about 
a drive-by in La Quinta's senior parking lot Oct. 27, except a few graphs in 
the back of the local news pages. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Principal Mitch Thomas, a student booted out of La Quinta a year 
ago and a male friend pulled into the senior parking lot after school that day, 
and one of them jumped out. He pointed the barrel of a .25-millimeter automatic 
toward the campus and sprayed five or six shots, apparently at random. There 
were not many students around, although volleyball team members, lined up for a 
group photo, would later say they heard pops but did not immediately realize 
bullets were flying nearby. Fortunately, nobody was hit, and somebody 
recognized the guys in the car that peeled out onto McFadden Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrests are made and a motive suspected -- girlfriend-boyfriend hassles -- but 
never established. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a tough blow at a school that prides itself on security and the 
principal's zero tolerance for even fistfights among students. During job 
interviews Thomas conducted, he drilled campus supervisors such as Dominic 
Palumbo, a towering Texan, and Pat Faulkner, a solid, no-nonsense mother of 
five, with questions like: How fast can you run the 100-yard dash? How fast can 
you scale a 10-foot fence? 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things I looked for by asking that was a sense of humor," Thomas 
says. "It's essential. Pat's response was great. She says, 'It depends on 
what's on the other side.' You need to know does this (campus worker) have a 
sense of humor? . . . Because if they are hard-nosed with those kids all the 
time, they're not going to make it." 
</P>
<P>
 The levity and vigilant attention to problems seem to be working. Unlike my 
years here, the entire perimeter of the campus is gated, and the three open 
entrances are under routine watch by the walkie-talkie-toting paid supervisors 
and three administrators. Visitors must be checked in by staff and given 
special sticker badges. Both parking lots are closely watched. 
</P>
<P>
 The October shooting episode scares the heck out of her, supervisor Faulkner 
admits, but it is an exception. Mostly the challenge is the day-in, day-out 
mouthing off or rebellion that she tangles with. 
</P>
<P>
 "They test you," she says, smiling and shaking her head. "But what else is new 
about kids? I got my own. I should know." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The continual complaints of campus budget cuts are an evergreen among faculty, 
parents and students. Today's spokesman for the issue is school newspaper 
editor Chris Dutton. 
</P>
<P>
 "So much has been cut," says Chris, 17, a blond senior staffing the lunchtime 
bake-sale table to benefit La Quinta's Students Against Drunk Driving chapter. 
He also co-captains the mock trial team, edits the Aztec Sun and works on the 
yearbook. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school newspaper has been cut back to five editions (a year); Drama 2, 3 
and 4 is one class, and there's no play," says Chris, who works part-time at 
JCPenney's credit department. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounding amusingly like an older person always seeing the past better than the 
present, Chris says students during his underclass years had far more spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 He is very ambitious and ready to move on to college -- a university in New 
Zealand where he will study political science and broadcast journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 He sometimes seems older than some of his classmates, maybe because he has 
self-awareness that comes from some painful self-examination. Childhood friends 
of his were messed up pretty bad on drugs, and Chris had to think hard about 
his own furtive drinking. In his sophomore year he was scared that it was out 
of control, so he went clean and sober. Hence his leadership role in SADD. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he is only an average student because he often takes on too much and 
then doesn't finish everything, teachers sense Chris will succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 But in any school of 1,300 kids -- any community of 1,300 people -- not all 
will be able to fix their problems -- or rise above them. And La Quinta is no 
different. Nancy Wride, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
<P>
 Wride attended La Quinta High School from fall 1973 to spring 1977 and in 
those years worked as a reporter for the Aztec Sun. She covered the big stories 
of the day, from President Gerald Ford's campaign stop at Mile Square Park to 
prom expenses. She joined the staff of the Los Angeles Times in 1979 while a 
student at Cal State Fullerton and has won numerous awards, including the state 
publishers's award for feature writing. Gail Fisher, Times Staff Photographer 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher graduated from Garfield High School in Akron, Ohio, in 1972 and earned 
her BA from Miami University of Ohio. She taught high school woodworking and 
photography, then left to earn a master's in photograhpy at Ohio University. In 
1980, she joined the San Bernardino Sun and three years later moved to the 
Times. She has won many awards and was twice named photographer of the year. 
Profiling La Quinta High 
</P>
<P>
 Good attendance, a low dropout rate and a diverse student body are the norm at 
La Quinta High School. It was the fifth school to be built in the Garden Grove 
Unified District, thus the name, which means "The Fifth" in Spanish. The Basics 
Enrollment: 1,370 Full-time faculty: 54 Opened: 1963 Mascot: Aztecs Athletic 
achievements: 151 league championships, 15 CIF finals, 12 CIF championships 
National Merit Finalists: 14 in past five years Dropout Rates 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta's students are less likely to drop out than are those from other 
schools in the district and county. Rates for 1992-93 school year: La Quinta: 
7.0% Garden Grove Unified: 10.8% Countywide: 10.8% Taking Attendance 
</P>
<P>
 Over the 1993-94 school year at La Quinta: * Daily attendance averaged 98.6% * 
Fewer than 0.5% of students were truant daily * Fewer than 0.5% of students 
were suspended * There were 277 days of suspensions among entire student 
population * Three students were expelled for incidents involving either drugs 
or violence After School 
</P>
<P>
 The breakdown of 1993 graduates' destinations: Four-year college: 22% Two-year 
college: 55% Work force: 14% Military, other: 4% Trade, technical: 5% 
Scholastic Assessment Test 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta's average SAT math scores are the highest in its district. Average 
scores for 1993-94: 03,23,08,06 Verbal Math La Quinta High School 400 535 
Garden Grove Unified 389 504 Countywide 436 523 Ethnicity 
</P>
<P>
 Whites and Latinos make up the majority of Orange County's high school 
population. At La Quinta, a high percentage of Asian/Pacific Islanders reflects 
the strong Vietnamese presence in Westminster. Breakdowns for the 1993-94 
school year: 04,25,08,14,12 La Garden Grove Countywide Quinta Unified Asian,

JAZZ REVIEW; HAMPTON, REDMAN QUARTET TOP THE BILL AT PLAYBOY FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first day of the 16th annual Playboy Jazz Festival followed a pattern that 
has served producer George Wein well in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 You can be sure that the program will open with an amateur band, usually a 
good excuse for showing up late. This year it was the Roosevelt High School 
Ensemble, fair on teamwork but weak on solos (aren't they all?). 
</P>
<P>
 You can be no less certain that the mix will include at least two or three 
pop/funk/contemporary groups, a couple of the currently hot jazz soloists, and 
a sure-fire crowd pleaser to close out the eight-hour marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's show-stopper was the tireless, 85-year-old Lionel Hampton, whose 
all-star nine-piece group, known as the Golden Men of Jazz, proved themselves 
more like men of steel, with wills of iron, as he took them through their 
decades-old paces. He was saluted by unyielding roars from a capacity crowd 
reluctant to let him go. 
</P>
<P>
 Solos by trumpeters Sweets Edison and Pete Candoli, a drum battle with Louie 
Bellson and Hampton, and Hampton's warmly affecting vocal on "What a Wonderful 
World" kept the set luminously alive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For those who came to hear some unadulterated, state-of-the-art jazz, the 
Joshua Redman Quartet stood out. Redman, no less at home before 18,000 fans 
than when he faces an intimate club audience, resorted a little too often to 
squeaks and squeals and nether honks, a tendency he should watch; but he's 
still the most commanding young tenor sax virtuoso on the scene, and his group 
includes the phenomenon Brad Mehldau on piano and the always startling bassist 
Christian McBride. 
</P>
<P>
 If any two soloists stood out, they were Mehldau and Henry Johnson. The 
latter, playing guitar with Ramsey Lewis, had no trouble stealing the spotlight 
from the leader, whose piano was not helped by the sound system. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassandra Wilson, a much-praised singer, has to her credit a diverse 
repertoire, from very early blues ("Hellhound on My Trail") to the occasional 
standard ("Skylark"). She also boasts an unconventional backup group, with 
violin and harmonica. Singing material from her album "Blue Light Till Dawn," 
Wilson at times, if unseen, could be mistaken for a man in the Johnny Mathis 
range. Her blend of ancient material had an urban-country beat that works well. 
</P>
<P>
 Wynton Marsalis had the misfortune of following two pop groups, Earl Klugh's 
and Spyro Gyra. An inattentive audience seemed disinterested in his writing, 
which makes ingenious use of four horns. Playing excerpts from a suite in his 
recent album, Marsalis didn't connect until a Dixieland passage brought the 
fun-oriented listeners to their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Flora Purim, teamed with her percussionist-husband Airto, gave a sadly 
lackluster performance. The Family Laws offered light entertainment with Hubert 
and Ronny Laws on flute and tenor sax; their siblings, Debra and Eloise, 
singing; and a new vocal addition, Ronny's daughter, Michelle.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; LOOKING FOR SCHMALTZ IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Give Michael Bolton credit for improvement. A few years ago when he played the 
Universal Amphitheatre, his show was as lame as any you'll ever see by a 
big-time recording artist. On all counts, it was a disaster, from musicianship 
to dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bolton has upgraded considerably. At the Blockbuster Pavilion on Friday, 
he got strong support from his band and backup singers and presented a slick, 
well-oiled production befitting his superstar status.  
</P>
<P>
 In the context of middle-of-the-road concerts, you couldn't ask for anything 
better. In this genre, it's a plus to perform a ballad in a way that flagrantly 
tugs at the heartstrings. Bolton wrung tears out of the audience on such songs 
as "When a Man Loves a Woman," "How Am I Supposed to Live Without You" and 
"Ain't Got Nothin'." 
</P>
<P>
 Bolton is well aware that his audience loves to bathe in bathos, and gives 
them a chance to do just that. So if you're looking for subtleties and nuances, 
don't go to a Bolton show. But if you're in the market for shameless schmaltz 
-- then you came to the right place. 
</P>
<P>
 You can bash Bolton for many things but you can't say he doesn't have a 
powerful voice. In his big stab at humor, he sang a snippet from the opera 
"Pagliacci." Maybe he's not quite ready for the Met, but that bit still is a 
dazzler. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest Bolton bashers are probably hard-core fans of black music. To 
them, all Bolton is doing is ripping off the styles of Ray Charles, Otis 
Redding and other R&B greats. 
</P>
<P>
 They do have a point. 
</P>
<P>
 The secret to Bolton's success is that he has taken this black style, modified 
it and made it palatable to his core audience -- white females between 25 and 
45. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of them probably aren't that well schooled in R&B and consequently are 
less sensitive to the derivative aspects of his style. You can bet they're not 
hearing echoes of Charles and Redding. Judging from the screaming at Friday's 
show, all they probably hear is passionately romantic lyrics being crooned by 
this dreamy-looking guy. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole evening was a ballad-belter's delight, beginning with the set by 
opening act Celine Dion. When it comes to belting pop ballads, Dion is Whitney 
Houston II. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you can't stomach shameless schmaltz, Dion is impressive. Her 
blow-off-the-roof style works better live than on her albums. She's a warm, 
personable type, which gives added impact to such songs as the "Beauty and the 
Beast" theme and "The Power of Love." With all that talent, it's a shame that 
Dion doesn't use a wider variety of material or take an artistic chance or two. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bolton and Dion perform tonight, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday at the Greek 
Theatre, 2700 N. Vermont Ave., 7:30 p.m. $23-$48, (213) 480-3232.

 Hall of Famers: Alan Alda, Howard Cosell and Oprah Winfrey are among seven 
people selected for induction this year into the Television Academy Hall of 
Fame. The other four are former news producer Fred Friendly, veteran executive 
Barry Diller and animation producers Bill Hanna and Joseph Barbera. Induction 
ceremonies will be conducted by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences this 
fall at the Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park in Orlando, Fla., bringing to 70 the 
number of TV Hall of Fame members.

 Zooming Back: Remember the popular late-1970s children's public-TV show called 
"Zoom," written, performed by and for 7- to 12-year-olds? WGBH-Boston, where it 
was produced, is looking into bringing it back. The earlier version had 
Zoomjokes, Zoomdos (crafts and science projects), Zoomgoodies (recipes sent in 
by kids) and Zoomraps (serious chats). While WGBH acknowledges the show looks 
dated, the station will be running 12 episodes for six weeks in Boston to ask 
kids what they would do to update it. If all goes well, a whole new generation 
of kids could be enjoying a new "Zoom" by January, 1996. MOVIES

 Visionary: Steven Spielberg, Oliver Stone, Tim Burton, Penny Marshall, Joel

among those honored at RP International's 21st annual Vision Awards Saturday 
night at the Regent Beverly Wilshire. The awards, sponsored by the group that 
fights retinitis pigmentosa and other eye diseases, recognize those in the 
creative community who have demonstrated "rare vision" in bringing unique 
projects to audiences. Also at the event, the group's new Theater Vision 
program was announced. The system features an audio track that runs 
concurrently with dialogue so those without sight can experience a feature film 
at the theater with the use of headphones. Spielberg's "Schindler's List" will 
be the first film to use the narration; the movie also received a special film 
award at the ceremony. THE ARTS

 Under the Layers: An Italian art expert said that a painting on wood that had 
been thought to be an imitation was in fact a masterpiece by medieval artist 
Giotto Di Bondone. Filippo Todini, professor of art history at the University 
of Udine in Italy, said he had discovered a Madonna and Child painted by Giotto 
behind several layers of paint applied to the original in past centuries. 
Giotto, who died in 1337, is world famous for his frescoes depicting the life 
of St. Francis at the cathedral in Assisi and for the tower he designed in 
Florence, Italy.

No. 1, which appeared in June of 1938 with Superman on its cover for his debut, 
sold for $54,625. Detective Comics No. 27, which introduced Batman in May of 
1939, went for $48,875. The comics, which cost a dime when they came out, sold 
for well above their pre-sale estimates. The auction was Sotheby's most

THE LANGUAGE OF MUSIC CONTINUES TO DEVELOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The language of classical music is powerful and inspiring. It moves to action 
those of us who love music. And those who work within its disciplines face long 
hours of hard work in pursuing our craft for a sometimes fleeting moment of 
recognition and, maybe, glory. Music's power is so great that its universality 
is taken upon as a personal music, so that the music becomes one's own, and we 
worry when the music composed today does not fit into our definitions of music. 
</P>
<P>
 The language of music is not dead to composers of today ("Classical Music 
Tapped Out," June 6) but is there to be formed by their skills and 
individuality. Their works may not conform to all listeners as correct or 
useful and, indeed, may appear to be dead. It certainly is not. 
</P>
<P>
 The music I compose and that of my colleague and fellow Independent Composers 
Assn. officer Burt Goldstein is not the same musical language, yet it is still 
part of the overall continuum of the language of music. 
</P>
<P>
 I base my music on theme, harmony and a steady rhythm; perhaps a reiteration 
of past music or just a continuance of music based upon consonance and scales, 
somewhat rooted in the ancient chants. This is different from Goldstein's 
compositions, which are rooted in the more immediate past of sharper 
dissonance, shorter melodic gestures and changing rhythm structure. 
</P>
<P>
 However, to say one is right and one is wrong is upon the ear of the beholder. 
But to dismiss our musically divergent styles as either ugly and isolated or 
hopelessly imitative of the past is when one does not examine the past and the 
perceptions of our current musical masters. To look into the past for 
inspiration is not to transgress the Muse but to fall into the other world of 
composers who do not add new technique but refine existing ones. Neither world 
is incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
 The most disturbing factor of those opposed to today's continuum of music is 
the lack of faith in our individuality, that we are not capable today of 
creating music of lasting quality and beauty and perfection. It is really quite 
sad to think that our works as composers today are perceived as doomed before 
the ink dries, that the individuality and creative spark put into music is 
unworthy, as some have closed down their ability to experience the new.

'TONIGHT'S' BAND(S) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Doc Severinsen reacted much too kindly ("Actually, Branford, There Was a Real 
'Tonight Show' Band," June 13). Severinsen had a real band, and it played 
"Tonight Show" themes and arrangements of the American Songbook superbly.Many 
of its members were world-class musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Those of us who listened to Severinsen's band will never forget "Johnny's 
Theme," played as Carson took center stage. But if we live 100 years, none of 
us will ever be able to hum three successive notes from the dismal theme 
Branford Marsalis composed for the current version of "The Tonight Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Leno, albeit a gifted monologuist, will never equal the scope of Carson's 
comedic brilliance. Likewise, the Marsalis band, average players performing 
prosaic tunes, will never attain the musical brilliance of Severinsen's 
organization. It seems clear, however, that Severinsen thoroughly enjoyed his 
run as musical director of "The Tonight Show," whereas Marsalis projects an 
attitude of tolerating his very cushy job.

JAZZ; BRACKEEN NEEDS PUSH TO BREAK OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joanne Brackeen does what she does so well that it seems brutish to suggest 
that she should be doing something else. 
</P>
<P>
 Her performance at the Jazz Bakery on Friday was a brilliant display of 
contemporary power piano. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of what she played -- especially in originals such as "Picasso" -- leaned 
in the direction of contemporary concert music, often with great effectiveness. 
Her jazz-oriented material -- "Just in Time," "I Hear a Rhapsody" and "Just One 
of Those Things" -- pulsed with rhythmic complexities and harmonic densities 
reminiscent of her principal influences, McCoy Tyner and Chick Corea. 
</P>
<P>
 What was missing was a sense of openness and space, an opportunity for the 
music to break through all the virtuosic pyrotechnics. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, and almost always too briefly ("The Island" was a good example), 
Brackeen demonstrated the ability to spin out a lyrical line with sensitivity 
and feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 More often, she seemed determined to explore the piano's potential for 
orchestral sound masses -- not an intrinsically bad idea, had she also explored 
the instrument's capacity for gentler timbres. 
</P>
<P>
 An obviously gifted improviser and an innovative composer, Brackeen would be a 
far more convincing artist if she could expand her creative vision beyond the 
hard and fast primary colorations that dominate so much of her current work.

THEATER; 'MOON' AIMS HIGH, BUT IT'S NOT QUITE A CIRQUE THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cirque du Soleil hasn't passed through Los Angeles in quite awhile. Over 
the weekend Stefan Haves attempted to create the next best thing -- a Cirque de 
la Lune, so to speak -- at John Anson Ford Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, "Moon Over Madness," opened the L.A. County-sponsored Summer 
Nights at the Ford series Saturday and Sunday after a Friday preview. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the real moon's relationship to the sun, this "Moon" reflected only a 
fraction of the glory of the Cirque du Soleil. With the night sky stretching 
above the audience, with many spectators farther from the action than they 
would have been under the Cirque's big top, the Cirque's sense of intense focus 
was missing -- not to mention its budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, this "Moon" did stir up a few moments of mystery and whimsy that 
were fitting for the lunar theme. 
</P>
<P>
 The real moon looked rather wispy Saturday evening, and it didn't linger for 
long over the Ford. But the show's designers provided a fake moon -- a big, 
illuminated globe -- that came out during the opening scene and remained 
perched over the stage during the show. 
</P>
<P>
 In that opening scene, set in 1694 France, groups of washerwomen and male 
stick-cutters were suddenly distracted from their duties and transformed into 
Dionysian revelers by the sight of the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Then we suddenly jumped ahead 300 years to the wilds of Cahuenga Pass (where 
the Ford is located) and a tongue-in-cheek "nature talk" from Ranger Greg (Greg 
Burns), complete with slides. 
</P>
<P>
 Next up was a big group number, choreographed by Carol Guidry, that first 
presented a chaotic view of the cacophony of the many electronic messages we 
hear nowadays, then concluded with lines of dancers stomping in rhythm. Natch, 
it was followed by a rooster (Daniel Stein) scooting across the stage in a 
sports car. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, there wasn't much rhyme or reason to the order of events, and 
the show's rhythm rose or fell largely on the merits of individual acts. 
</P>
<P>
 While Haves apparently tried to impose some sort of a larger vision -- the 
halves of the program were titled "Incubation" and "Celebration" -- it never 
became very clear. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This would be no problem if the individual acts were uniformly strong. But 
there were quite a few high points, low points and in-between points. There 
were, in fact, too many points -- the show lasted nearly three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The splashiest, most sure-fire act came near the end with Matt Plendl's 
virtuosic Hula-Hooping. 
</P>
<P>
 The funniest act, with the possible exception of the aforementioned Ranger 
Greg, was Denis Lacombe's mad orchestra conductor, previously seen here with, 
yes, the Cirque du Soleil. 
</P>
<P>
 Clog dancers Thom Cagle and Jim Newman were fun, but their placement soon 
after a bigger dance number wasn't the best. Haves' signature "Backman" act was 
meant for a smaller hall. June Melby created a pleasant bit of musical/lyric 
nonsense. Jeffrey Daymont's juggling of blocks elicited a few oohs and ahs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first act finale, a bunch of guys -- posing as chickens -- tried to 
cross the road. It was a cute bit, but hardly uproarious. Former Story Theatre 
master Paul Sand returned to the stage with a sketch about a prince and a fly 
(Joe Seely in a great fly costume). 
</P>
<P>
 "No Outlet" was essentially a two-woman comedy routine that had been trimmed 
down from a 24-actor number, according to the program. Why did they bother to 
keep it at all? 
</P>
<P>
 The only nod toward aerial stunts was a "bungee ballet," in which a group of 
airborne jumpers bounced up and down while Duke McVinnie's band played. 
Actually, it was McVinnie's growly voice and bluesy band that tied the 
proceedings together better than any other element. 
</P>
<P>
 Felipe Sanchez got the credit for the wide variety of fanciful costumes, and 
Steven Ritz-Barr contributed some interesting puppetry, most notably in "Extra 
Soles," when one of the "puppets" suddenly came to life.

COUNTERPUNCH: POPCORN STORY A LOT OF HOT AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY S. RUTKOWSKI, Gregory S. Rutkowski is vice president of AMC Theatres 
West Operations. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It must have been a slow news day for three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how long the public was bombarded with "news" about popcorn, popping 
oil and cholesterol, thanks to a press effort by the Center for Science in the 
Public Interest. When the dust settled and the Center's scrutiny turned to 
breakfast muffins, the public was left even more confused about what was once 
America's favorite movie-time snack. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times covered the Center's story a total of five times -- once on the 
front page of Metro, three times on the front page of Calendar and once on the 
front page of Life & Style. Three of the stories were so-called "news" 
articles, the other two were commentaries. It is with the final commentary, 
"Choose Your Oil" (Calendar, May 26), by David Kronke, that theater owners are 
finally saying, "Enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Kronke's snide review of local theaters' popcorn by "eight upstanding citizens 
. . . with nothing better to do . . . " was unnecessarily mean-spirited. 
Considering that, on a daily basis, the Los Angeles Times provides estimable 
coverage to all other facets of the industry, this piece stood out as 
containing more superfluous fat than even the largest tub of popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Where was this same kind of mega-press coverage in 1990, when AMC Theatres 
converted its popping oil used in more than 50 theaters in California, Arizona, 
Washington and Colorado to 100% canola oil? A press release sent out at the 
time garnered not one drop of ink. The entertainment reporters said it was a 
food issue, and food reporters claimed it was an entertainment industry issue. 
Curiously, today, it's both -- and more. 
</P>
<P>
 Where was the mega-press coverage when these same theaters went smoke-free 
last year? The Times eked out only one paragraph on this newsworthy event when 
AMC established a smoke-free policy. Obviously, AMC Theatres does not arrange 
for a healthful environment and customer conveniences based on the amount of 
media coverage we hope we can garner. If that were the case, moviegoers would 
be sitting on benches instead of in extra-wide, padded, reclining seats with 
cup-holder armrests. 
</P>
<P>
 AMC Theatres is constantly re-evaluating and initiating new customer 
conveniences. When presented with the information about cholesterol-causing 
saturated fats in the late 1980s, AMC began actively searching for a healthier 
replacement popping oil. The entire theater chain tested a number of lower-fat 
oils. When we asked for feedback from our patrons, in many instances, customers 
wanted theaters to keep using coconut oil. 
</P>
<P>
 In the West, however, customers overwhelmingly asked for a low-fat alternative 
that tasted good. We eventually chose low-in-saturated-fat, 100% canola oil in 
the states of California, Arizona, Washington and Colorado. AMC's message about 
its long-time use of canola oil was lost, or worse, misconstrued as being 
motivated by the recently released study. 
</P>
<P>
 The effects of this mix-up were that customers stopped buying popcorn. The 
ongoing coverage of the issue did not help clarify or educate consumers. Some 
of it may have been entertaining, but it was at the expense of movie theaters. 
And, at the expense of other, more valid news stories that were shoved aside in 
favor of yet another angle on popcorn and popping oil. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because Kronke displays an unfamiliarity with the economics of theater 
management, (suggesting that his next "investigative" piece focus on the price 
of popcorn), we'd like him to know that revenues from movie theaters' 
concession stands contribute a great deal to the enjoyment of the 
movie-watching experience. The extra-wide aisles, the clean-up crews that 
remove empty cups and wrappers between screenings, the excellent sound systems, 
the wide-screen presentations, the professionalism of the box office and 
management -- all are supported with revenue from concessions.  
</P>
<P>
 AMC Theatres has made a substantial investment in Los Angeles. We employ 
hundreds of full-and part-time employees, sponsor local sports teams, run 
public service announcements and invest in Southern California real estate. We 
deserve to have our side of the popcorn controversy covered fairly and 
accurately. 
</P>
<P>
 We hope that the popcorn issue is now put to rest, but if it is not, we hope 
that future coverage is professional and not the sum experiences of "eight . . 
. citizens . . . with nothing better to do."

COUNTERPUNCH: IT'S NOT A JOKE -- SHE LOVES THE VIOLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAMELA GOLDSMITH, Pamela Goldsmith, a free-lance violist, holds a Doctor of 
Musical Arts degree from Stanford University and is on the faculties of USC and 
Cal State Northridge. She has been heard on numerous motion picture and 
recording scores, and has been honored by the National Academy of Recording 
Arts and Sciences, Hollywood Chapter. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I wish to respond to the article "Musicians Take Jabs With Nary a Sour Note" 
(Laugh Lines, Life & Style, May 18). I am a violist, and I am very, very tired 
of viola jokes . Writer Tom Hensley chooses to report these as his first 
examples of "musician jokes," and later he asks why musician jokes are 
acceptable when ethnic jokes are not, adding: "Are violists less a community 
than Polish Americans?" 
</P>
<P>
 As vice president of the American Viola Society (720 members), I can tell you 
that we are a community, we have international congresses each year, and we 
publish a journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Why play the viola? Why not the violin, where the student can become a star 
with an enormous solo repertoire? Why not play a wind or brass instrument? What 
about the percussion instruments? 
</P>
<P>
 We who chose the viola know that it was for the sound, the distinctive, 
beautiful, mellow quality that only a viola can produce. Most of us started on 
the violin, and soon learned that its often piercing, sometimes strident 
quality left us edgy and unsatisfied. Some of us tried other instruments as 
well -- the piano, for example, and found its mechanistic response not human 
enough. In fact, the viola is our voice. The only voice we will ever need to 
express ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The sound of the viola has been variously described as dark, woody, autumnal. 
Yes, it is all of these, and sometimes sorrowful, melancholy. But it can also 
be joyful, playful and lighthearted. A violist can express a multitude of 
emotions through the instrument: calm and repose as well as anxiety and 
excitement. Our range is wide, we can enjoy the higher tessituras; but there is 
nothing as satisfying in this world as a resounding open C! 
</P>
<P>
 The vibrations of the C string go right up through the jaw into the head, and 
the entire skull resonates with this note. It is at this moment that the 
violist experiences the most instantaneous knowledge of selfhood, of personal 
validation. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, I played an outdoor chamber music concert, and just before 
the beginning of the concert, a bee flew into my viola. It was buzzing around 
inside. What to do? I grabbed the bow and played the loudest open C I could 
muster. In a few seconds, the buzzing stopped, and I shook the insect out of 
the body of the viola. The vibrations had stunned it into submission. Need I 
say more? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A violist knows the physical effort necessary to produce music. The instrument 
is bigger and heavier than the violin, and requires considerably more effort to 
play. Violists know about fatigue, about sore fingers and tired muscles. A 
sports medicine consultant will tell you that repetitive motions are the most 
difficult for the human body to sustain, and the most injurious. Look at the 
viola part in any ensemble composition, what do you see? Repetitive motions. 
Finger placement and stretching are more demanding than on the violin because 
of the greater distance between the notes. Applied bow pressure and weight are 
also more effortful.  
</P>
<P>
 What about the role of the violist in the musical kingdom? It is true that we 
seldom have a chance to star, but for most of us the supporting role feels 
right. We understand the responsibility of making the violinist and cellist 
look good in the chamber music ensemble by giving them the most support 
possible. When playing the accompanying musical figures, we know how to 
accommodate: when to play forte and when to hold back, when to push the tempo 
and when to hold steady. We listen! We know the inner parts and how, without 
them, there would be almost no music at all.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the violist's greatest attribute is commitment. We are committed to 
music and to the viola in particular. Over the years we constantly seek new 
repertoire, and ask composers to write something special for us. We discuss 
repertoire among ourselves all the time, and trade music. A new recording by a 
violist is an event. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it is not always easy to be a violist -- sometimes we take harassment 
from others, and much of the time we are ignored and our importance goes 
unrecognized. But we love the viola fervently and cannot imagine playing any 
other musical instrument.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; ETHERIDGE AT EASE WITH SELF, SONGS

<TEXT>
<P>
 If any fans came to Melissa Etheridge's Greek Theatre concert to see whether 
she has changed somehow since officially coming out of the closet last year, 
they really got only one overt gesture: She closed the regular set of Friday's 
two-hour-plus show with a sly revision of Rod Stewart's sexual coming-of-age 
ballad "Maggie May" -- a perfect vehicle for Etheridge's raspy voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the singer-songwriter seemed more comfortable and natural on stage than 
at any time since she first showed up as an acoustic solo performer around town 
in the mid-'80s.But Friday that seemed to have less to do with her personal 
revelations than with her apparent realization that she needn't pump up every 
song into an anthemic blimp.

 While Etheridge still seems to have arena-rock aspirations, in the first of 
her two nights at the Greek she and her new three-piece band plied them with 
grace. And such recent songs as the warm "Come to My Window" reflect a maturity 
that has allowed her to explore more of the subtler textures of both her voice 
and her favorite topic, intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Etheridge has come up with a legitimate anthem: The sight of 
thousands of people -- male and female, gay and straight -- singing along to 
"All American Girl" was a terrific rock 'n' roll moment. STEVE HOCHMAN

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; TAYLOR STICKS TO WHAT HE KNOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Once he was the Walking Man. Now you might peg James Taylor by one of the more 
recent song titles that appeared on his set list Saturday at Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre: "The Frozen Man." 
</P>
<P>
 Not frozen in bearing: In his low-key way, the smiling, ever-gracious Taylor 
had no problem establishing a warm connection with his fans. And certainly not 
frozen out of the marketplace: At 46, this epitome of the early-'70s 
introspective singer-songwriter movement remains a hot concert draw. The 
15,000-capacity house was virtually packed. 
</P>
<P>
 What's frozen, and has been since early in his career, is Taylor's artistic 
development. Ideally, a performer's path can take new directions even as he or 
she moves through middle age. Taylor doesn't seem interested in any such 
shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 His fans evidently don't mind. Taylor's voice remains as pleasing as ever, 
with its gentle, reedy appeal and comfortable, hangdog quality. He played most 
of the old favorites, and usually rendered them much as he originally recorded 
them. His backing band was a nine-piece ensemble with the skills to bring 
recording studio precision to the concert stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor performs Tue., Wed., Fri., Sat. and Sun. at the Universal Amphitheatre, 
100 Universal City Plaza, Universal City, 8:15 p.m. $24.50 - $40, (818) 
980-9421. MIKE BOEHM

DANCE REVIEW; 'CLERESTORY': METAPHYSICAL ROMP IN MODULAR SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dances poised on the verge of dream-states and focused by severe spatial 
restriction made up a stimulating program titled "Clerestory," Friday at La 
Boca, Sunshine Mission, downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Resituating the performance area for each piece, choreographers Melinda Ring, 
Roxanne Steinberg and Naoyuki Oguri created specific dance environments that 
heightened the intimacy and sense of flow in their new works. 
</P>
<P>
 Ring's solo, "Edge of Reflection," found her literally cornered by the 
audience and composer Paul Chavez while transforming his guitar motifs and 
textures into thoughtful movement statements. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In her rising, falling, reaching, twisting responses to Chavez, she neither 
became the music nor ever appeared engulfed by it. Instead, she seemed to 
function as a translator using some undivulged system of physical-musical 
equivalents. Or perhaps dreaming them up as she went along. 
</P>
<P>
 Her unaccompanied "Explanation 4" in the courtyard cast her in a similar role: 
standing behind a book and "reading" unseen its lines of print with her 
fingertips. Exploring the air and her own body in the same manner, she again 
used the simplest movement to invoke profound perceptual issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Less mental than Ring's pieces, Steinberg's solo, "The Color of Water," used 
prerecorded music by Chavez and a narrow path between banks of spectators to 
isolate her immersion in what seemed an intuitive process of renewal. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly curling downward, inward, she would end in the fetal position only to 
spring out, up, her arms spread as if ready to embrace whatever she 
encountered. Soon, however, the need to pull back and sink into total 
self-absorption reclaimed her. 
</P>
<P>
 Set on and around a tiny, black platform stage, Oguri's nightmarish "Drift" 
used his new seven-member company, Renzokutai, as a kind of mini-society: ever 
watchful, fearful and inevitably victimized by violence of its own making. 
</P>
<P>
 Stark, grotesque dance imagery in Japanese butoh style gained a dark richness 
and even delicacy here from Chavez's score, which incorporated everything from 
the sweetest wind chimes all the way to thunderous lengths of sheet-metal 
wielded by the dancers themselves. Plus the smallest bowed instruments you've 
ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Performances of "Clerestory" resume next weekend and are offered free to the 
public under a grant from the L.A. City Department of Cultural Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Clerestory," new dances by Melinda Ring, Roxanne Steinberg and Naoyuki 
Oguri, continues at 8 p.m. Friday through Sunday, at La Boca, Sunshine Mission, 
2600 S. Hoover St. (at Adams Blvd.). Admission is free. Information: ( 310 )

MUSIC REVIEW; ANGLICAN CHOIR ESSAYS SHEPPARD'S LATIN WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With helicopters audibly circling a short distance away at the O. J. Simpson 
estate, a very different event was taking place atop the hill at Mount St. 
Mary's College in Brentwood Friday evening. The counterpoint between the two 
was sometimes eerie. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mary Chapel, the Anglican Choir of St. Luke's (of Monrovia) under director 
Dana T. Marsh was devoting an entire concert -- reportedly for the first time 
in the United States -- to the music of 16th-Century English Chapel Royal 
composer John Sheppard. Further limiting the field, Marsh and choir performed 
only Sheppard's Latin liturgical music, most of it thought to have been written 
during the reign of Mary I and the brief re-establishment of papal authority in 
England. 
</P>
<P>
 If this all sounds rather strange and removed from our everyday experience, 
one could be thankful for that, yet Marsh aggressively and consistently fought 
that impression. He is an energetic and persuasive conductor, and he 
accomplished a welcome and never inappropriate athleticism in these 
performances. And since Sheppard's music, on this occasion mostly in six parts, 
is above all richly and vigorously sonorous, Marsh's approach (along with the 
resonant chapel acoustics) produced impressive results. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the 21-voice ensemble offered 13 works, ranging from the quiet, solemn 
"Libera nos, salva nos" to the resplendent, texturally varied, eight-voice 
"Sacris solemniis," considered one of the little-known composer's finest 
achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 In these Latin works, the bare chant of the verses is set in startling 
contrast to the rolling, harmonious polyphony of the responses, saturated and 
glowing with thirds. The composer wrote particularly high soprano parts, and 
the Anglican Choir's three sopranos trumpeted them with piercing purity. 
Indeed, the entire ensemble proved assured in all of its efforts, and 
euphonious, sensitive to musical curve and sturdy. TIMOTHY MANGAN

THEATER REVIEW; 'ALOHA LAS VEGAS' STAYS ON HAWAII TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Edward Sakamoto's comedy "Aloha Las Vegas," which played a limited engagement 
at the Japan America Theatre downtown and closed Sunday, immerses us in a 
veritable waterfall of Hawaiian culture. The play also points up a little-known 
modern-day phenomenon -- the exodus of native Hawaiians to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Wally (Lawrence T. Fukumoto), a recently widowed Hawaiian who has lived in 
Honolulu all his life, is thinking about pulling up stakes and retiring to Sin 
City. As his friend Harry (Dennis Ihara) points out, Wally could sell his 
island home for big money, buy a place in Vegas for a fraction of the cost, and 
spend the rest of his life gambling and having fun in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 This plan horrifies Wally's "old maid" daughter, June (Karen Yamamoto 
Hackler). Their family has lived in Hawaii for more than 100 years. Such a 
move, at least in June's eyes, would constitute not only an abandonment of 
family and friends, but of their rich Hawaiian culture as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The desultory plot stretches thin at points, and Sakamoto lays on the local 
color a bit thick. Characters segue into rambling anecdotes that may get laughs 
but have little to do with the progression of the story. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, the male characters reminisce about the home-grown baseball 
stars that shone in Honolulu Stadium during the 1940s and '50s. Extremely 
specific references such as these may bring ripples of recognition from the 
Hawaiian expatriates in the audience, but limit the comedy's general appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the glossary of pidgin terms in the program, many haoles in the 
audience may find the language barrier difficult to bridge. Whatever your 
ethnic origin, Sakamoto's ebullient, frequently scatological patois is 
anthropologically fascinating, even when the meaning is elusive. However, a 
heavy reliance on bathroom jokes does cheapen the humor somewhat. Still, the 
ebullient family atmosphere in the cast spills over into the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 James A. Nakamoto's direction is neither subtle, nor dull. One must simply 
abandon Mainland expectations and relax into the leisurely rhythms. First 
produced at the Kumu Kahua Theatre in Honolulu, the play remains on island 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 This production features the original Hawaiian cast. The actors mug, roll 
their eyes and generally ham it up, and though a few, particularly Fukumoto, 
could have delved deeper into their characters, their kinetic performances 
enliven the occasionally sluggish pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Nan Asuncion, who plays Wally's housekeeper and friend, is an innocent, 
unspoiled, infinitely likable earth mother who epitomizes the attraction of the 
islands. 
</P>
<P>
 As June's suitor, Dann Seki plays a consummate nerd with an unexpectedly 
passionate side. Marcus R. Oshiro and Meredith R. Hill appear as Wally's 
bombastically macho son and his understanding wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the play sometimes seems like an exclusive club into which the 
uninitiated cannot penetrate, "Aloha Las Vegas" remains a tantalizing glimpse 
into a vanishing culture. Better a peep into paradise than no peep at all. 
</P>

Angeles Times.

TV REVIEW; 'ODYSSEY' CAN ONLY OFFER A TASTE OF DOS PASSOS' LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No one-hour film can possibly hope to encompass and make sense of a major 
artist's life, but it can provide a taste, an aroma, a sample of the artist's 
world. "The Odyssey of John Dos Passos" tries, but can't give us the whole man. 
It does, more modestly, give us that taste of Dos Passos. 
</P>
<P>
 His odysseys were several: From ashamed bastard child to supremely confident 
novelist of "U.S.A."; from bitter observer of bloody World War I to 
gallivanting friend of Paris bohemians, patrons and artists; from strident 
socialist to strident anti-communist. 
</P>
<P>
 There was another, which this film poorly describes: Beginning as a 
conventional writer with the usual approach to linear narrative, Dos Passos 
exploded out of this shell, much as his friend Pablo Picasso exploded out of 
figurative painting to explore Cubism. 
</P>
<P>
 This condensed portrait is better at describing the events and ideas swirling 
around the writer than the actual work itself. Thus, each 20th-Century decade 
is framed in a mock newsreel of key events, and the montage of 1920s 
industrialism nicely suggests the "machine" of capitalism that Dos Passos saw 
devouring the common man. (Another montage of New York is a paltry visual 
accompaniment to William Hurt's superb reading of Dos Passos' propulsive novel, 
"Manhattan Transfer.") 
</P>
<P>
 Because he filled his novels with his politics, and because the massive 
"U.S.A." was a monument of leftist literature, Dos Passos' eventual shift to 
the right was a seismic-like event in his life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He was perhaps in a better position than his peers on the artistic left to 
condemn communism, since he had spent time in the Soviet Union, observed 
Stalin's power firsthand and then Soviet influence on anti-facists in the 
Spanish civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 History proved Dos Passos correct, twice. The "robber barons" were a cancer on 
American democracy, and Stalinism was Soviet communism's evil final act. 
</P>
<P>
 This "Odyssey" aptly concludes that Dos Passos was beyond right and left, that 
he was a libertarian anarchist who hated power of any sort. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also a writer too big for the television screen. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Odyssey of John Dos Passos" airs 10 p.m. tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28; 
7 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24.

DANCE REVIEWS; TERPSICORPS FAILS TO GAIN FOOTHOLD WITH LATC WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER FISHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 TerpsiCorps, a jazz and ballet-based dance company trying to get a foothold in 
the L.A. scene, found the going more than slippery in the first of two 
performances at the Los Angeles Theatre Center over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1992, the company was named for Terpsichore, muse of dance and 
choral music. At this point, it is safe to guess that the muse is not amused by 
this association, so uninspired was the choreographic spirit evident in several 
recent works by artistic director Loren Denker. 
</P>
<P>
 Set on a company of eight women, Denker's movements in all her pieces were 
relentlessly decorative and often vacuously presentational. The impression left 
is that dancers go from pose to pose, repeat simple combinations of 
occasionally jazzy ballet moves on one side then another, follow the beats of 
the music like slaves, then whirl to face us again, arms outstretched in a way 
reminiscent of nightclub floor shows. 
</P>
<P>
 With this formula, each dance was predictable, but some were worse than 
others: "Off Beat" had bland, robotic shifts and weakly menacing stares, and in 
"Bailes Espanoles," a series of prettified swirls and skirt twirling were 
skimmed off the surface of flamenco. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Submerged," various subsections named for seafood featured an excess of 
watery waving of arms and crab-like crawling. Occasionally, a dancer such as 
Yan Lin, with a beautiful line and delicately lyrical arms, caught focus, but 
she had little to work with. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the dancing, with its Musak-like blandness, the music for several 
pieces -- both live and on tape by saxophonist Lincoln Adler -- provided 
well-grounded and exciting gestures. During a pause between dances, Adler 
played a small solo before the curtain, his slightly shifting, narrow stance, 
quirky foot taps and punctuating mid-torso contractions offering up a miracle 
of integrated movement invention missing in the rest of the dancing. JENNIFER

'WOLF,' 'LION KING' GRAB THE MOVIE-GOERS; WHAT'S HOT . . . MAYBE HOTTER? . . . 
AND MAYBE NOT; 'FLINTSTONES' STILL STRONG IN SUMMER BOX-OFFICE COMPETITION; 
'GETTING EVEN WITH DAD' TRAILS

<P>
 Lions and tigers and. . . . Make that lions and wolves and a bear of an 
opening -- or, barely an opening -- for Macaulay Culkin. 
</P>
<P>
 Brows were unfurrowed, fists unclenched at Sony Pictures as Columbia's big 
summer movie gamble, the $70-million "Wolf," got off to a strong start, raking 
in an estimated $18.2 million on 2,117 screens, the second-best opening of the 
year behind "The Flintstones" and the studio's third biggest debut ever behind 
"Bram Stoker's Dracula" and "Ghostbusters II." 
</P>
<P>
 The next best showing at the weekend box office came from the runaway hit 
"Speed," which grossed $12.8 million in its second weekend, declining a scant 
12% (a 25% drop is average). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But for a real eye-popper try the $1.5-million to $1.6-million estimate Disney 
is shouting from the top of the mountain for its new animated feature "The Lion 
King" in only two theaters, one on each coast. 
</P>
<P>
 That breaks down to an unprecedented per-screen average of somewhere between 
$750,000 and $800,000 ("Wolf" grossed about $8,600 a screen). Add the $600,000 
or so garnered on Wednesday and Thursday and the five-day total passes the 
$2-million mark. Depending on precisely how well it did on Sunday -- final 
weekend figures will be released today -- "Lion King" had a shot at placing in 
the top 10, running neck and neck for ninth place with "When a Man Loves a 
Woman" and "Beverly Hills Cop III," each of which is playing on more than 1,000 
screens. 
</P>
<P>
 The third new release of the weekend, MGM's "Getting Even With Dad" starring 
Culkin and Ted Danson, will be lucky to earn back its production costs based on 
a $5.4-million weekend box-office projection from almost 2,000 screens, a 
fifth-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
 According to studio spokeswoman Terry Curtin, the mediocre showing was not 
unexpected and tepid reviews didn't help much either. She was also careful to 
distance the film from MGM/UA's new boss, Frank Mancuso, who arrived after it 
had already begun.  
</P>
<P>
 The weekend still lagged 20% behind last year when "Jurassic Park" walked the 
Earth and grossed $38 million. But, observed Columbia distribution head Jeff 
Blake, the distractions this past weekend were plenty: the NBA finals, a record 
heat wave in the East and the O. J. Simpson nationally televised car chase on 
Friday night, perhaps the biggest live media event in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest in the Jack Nicholson/Michelle Pfeiffer "Wolf" was strong and had 
been building steadily with the support of opening week advertising, buoyed by 
some good to excellent notices. And while industry insiders say Columbia had 
been hoping for a bit more, the grosses are potent for a non-sequel title. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of mouth will determine "Wolf's" longevity. "Bram Stoker's Dracula" 
opened in the $30-million range and then proceeded to lose momentum in 
subsequent weeks. Still, there will be some joy in Mudville if "Wolf" can 
approximate the $200 million worldwide that "Dracula" bit off ($80 million in 
the U.S. alone). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Disney could not have been hoping for more on "Lion King," which is playing 
exclusively at L.A.'s El Capitan theater and New York's Radio City Music Hall. 
Many shows sold out, including all day Saturday at Radio City. The 1,000-seat 
El Capitan had a record Saturday with more than $56,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.6-million figure is only misleading in that Radio City has more than 
5,000 seats and both theaters are charging premium prices as high as $25 (stage 
shows are included). "Lion King's" roaring debut is the best advertising money 
can't buy for its national release on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The $200-million-plus gross of Disney's last animated blockbuster, "Aladdin," 
will be hard to beat, but industry estimates are that "Lion" will do at least 
as well as "Beauty and the Beast" (in the $150 million area). Significantly for 
Disney, the bucks will arrive faster, since school's out for summer, and 
studios keep -- no pun intended -- the lion's share of grosses in the first few 
weeks of a film's release. 
</P>
<P>
 With the pressure of new summer openings, "The Flintstones" sagged to $8 
million for the weekend, down from $12.7 a weekend earlier. With a bedrock $95 
million in the till already, it will become 1994's first $100-million grossing 
release in the next week. It could be joined by "Speed," which has clocked $35 
million in only 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "City Slickers II," in its second weekend of release, drooped to about $7.2 
million from $11.2 million the weekend before, and was the fourth-place 
finisher in ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maverick," in sixth place, may not be a blockbuster, but it's definitely a 
solid hit, the past weekend accounting for $4.6 million and almost $74 million 
so far. But the Western genre may not be big enough for two superstars, and Mel 
Gibson may have to cede to Kevin Costner who rides thisa way in "Wyatt Earp" 
this coming weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Other top 10 releases included "Renaissance Man," seventh with $2.8 million, 
and "The Cowboy Way," eighth, $1.7 million.

 But if you've followed Smart's blinding array of TV movie personas, you can 
never be sure who the real Jean Smart is. 
</P>
<P>
 In an industry where most stars' personalities are frozen in place, changing 
little from movie to movie, Smart, at 41, stands as one of the most chameleonic 
actors in television. 
</P>
<P>
 In almost rat-a-tat-tat order over the past few years, Smart has portrayed a 
stern, laconic Florida swamp farmer ("The Yearling"); a heartbreakingly lovable 
borderline-retarded mother of six kids she nearly loses to the courts ("The 
Yarn Princess"); a small-town teacher who has a giddy romance with a rock star 
("Just My Imagination"), and a twisted killer in "Overkill: The Aileen Wuornos 
Story." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, her portrayal in this movie (based on a real case) ranks among her 
best. She assumes a tough, glazed pallor to play the prostitute who killed 
seven Johns she flagged down along backwater Florida roads. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jean is the best actress I've worked with in 10 years," says Peter Levin, the 
director of "Overkill." "She has tremendous emotional power. She's a dangerous 
actor because she's unpredictable." 
</P>
<P>
 And now she's making a return to theater, where she got her start, and the big 
screen. She will co-star with Mary Steenburgen in "Marvin's Room," a dark 
comedy-drama about a dysfunctional family, at the Tiffany Theatre in West 
Hollywood in September. After some hesitation about returning to comedy, she 
has agreed to co-star as a drunken neighbor who's continually coming on to the 
eldest Brady boy in Paramount's big-screen version of "The Brady Bunch," which 
starts shooting in L.A. this summer under the direction of Betty Thomas for 
Alan Ladd Jr. and Sherry Lansing. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for an actress who was so worried about being typecast that she walked 
away from a fat paycheck on "Designing Women" while the series was still going 
strong. She doesn't regret doing the series, but five years of playing sweet 
but slow Charlene were enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't pretend it's not the most visible thing I've done," Smart said. "I 
know networks wouldn't have offered me so much if I hadn't been on a hit show. 
But I didn't become an actor to get rich. I knew it was time to go." 
</P>
<P>
 She made a brief sortie back to the stage ("Laughing Wild" at the Tiffany), 
appeared in a little-seen but critically popular movie satirizing Hollywood 
wanna-bes ("Mistress"), then discovered a mother lode in TV movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's one of America's truly hidden talents. There's a light inside of her 
that can shine in all sorts of patterns," said Tom McLoughlin, who directed her 
in last spring's "The Yarn Princess" for ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 As she sat in her living room wearing a long, loose white sweater and faded 
jeans, Smart occasionally played with her family's latest addition -- Max, an 
8-week-old puppy who's half golden retriever, half black Labrador. She had put 
up a little wire mesh fence for the dog in the corner of the family playroom 
that was otherwise scattered with toys belonging to her 4 1/2-year-old son, 
Connor. Smart is married to actor Richard Gilliland, whom she met on the 
"Designing Women" set. 
</P>
<P>
 So how did Smart segue from playing a monster killer to a borderline retarded 
mother of six? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The question doesn't faze her, but she appears a bit puzzled by it. "Actors 
are supposed to be different people," she answers matter-of-factly. "That's 
what they taught us in drama school. 
</P>
<P>
 "My big influences," she continues, "were teachers -- Eve Roberts, who was my 
first drama coach at the University of Washington and who now teaches drama at 
USC. She expected us to act professional, and she hated theater games like 'Now 
you're going to lie on the floor, twitter your arms and tell me about 
yourself.' 
</P>
<P>
 "My other big inspiration was my high school teacher in Seattle. I was a 
cheerleader, but then I ran into Earl Kelly's acting class. He was tough, and I 
became smitten with theater." 
</P>
<P>
 After college, Smart hit the regional theater trail -- the Shakespeare 
Festival in Ashland, Ore., and theaters in Seattle, Atlanta, Alaska and 
Connecticut, where she played the classics. She landed in New York in late 
1980, where she made something of a name for herself playing a lesbian 
intellectual in "Last Summer at Bluefish Cove," an Off Broadway eye-opener for 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
 That landed her an agent, which led to a role on Broadway in "Piaf," which led 
to Hollywood. Here she reprised her "Last Summer at Bluefish Cove" role at the 
Fountain and the Cast theaters in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a part of me that thinks, 'Oh, why didn't I go to Hollywood when I 
was 22?' " she said. "Instead I did Shakespeare in the rain in Oregon. In 
reality, I can't stay away from theater. It's where you learn diversity and to 
use your whole body. In movies you do things from the neck up." 
</P>
<P>
 Many who work with Smart are baffled as to why she hasn't attracted more 
attention from major film producers. She wonders too. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's actor's paranoia," Smart said. "I don't want it to be a problem. I've 
always been a late bloomer. Also, there seems to be less work in features 
because the budgets are so big. By comparison, people forget that as far as 
exposure and recognition go, a network movie is virtually seen only one time. 
It's a one-shot thing for an actor. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you have to understand that I didn't expect people to see me in 
'Designing Women' and say, 'Let's put her in "Out of Africa, Part II." ' " 
</P>
<P>
 She paused and added: "If I were 25, there would probably be more work." 
</P>
<P>
 So she's keeping busy elsewhere, with theater -- "My husband and I have 
optioned an unproduced play from Kelly Masterson, 'Into the Light,' an 
extraordinary play that's a cross between 'Edward Scissorhands' and 'Equus' " 
-- and television. 
</P>
<P>
 She just finished shooting the eight-hour miniseries "Scarlett," a sequel to 
"Gone With the Wind," which will air on CBS in November. In it she plays an 
"outspoken, cigar-smoking" Charleston woman who is Rhett Butler's best friend, 
a character minted for the sequel. She gets to "doll up" and appears (with 
Timothy Dalton as Rhett and Joanne WhalleyKilmer as Scarlett O'Hara) in three 
of the four installments. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Scarlett' was a great deal of fun," she said. "I wanted to play someone who 
was lighthearted. I don't know what a shrink would say, but when you shoot a 
scene and get it right -- God, it feels great."
