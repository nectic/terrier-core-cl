 FIRSTHAND LOOK: Ventura teacher Marcia Greycloud has worked hard to make the 
subject of saving the rain forest a vivid lesson for her students. . . . This 
year, her efforts have been helped by a visit the Anacapa Middle School teacher 
made to a rain forest in Costa Rica (B1). Often, educators say, getting out of 
the classroom is the best way to make a topic come alive -- for teachers and 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 TOWER POWER: Big-name stars are still lining up to help Ojai Valley residents 
who want to move a radar tower off Sulphur Mountain. . . . Singer Bonnie Raitt 
is donating proceeds from the sale of 50 tickets to her concert tonight in 
Santa Barbara. The effort has previously attracted celebrities who live near 
the so-called Black Orb. . . . The one-year anniversary of the tower's 
construction is Sunday, and a candlelight vigil is planned -- but not at the 
tower. These days, protesters stay away from the site. "No one wants to be up 
there," tower opponent Kim Maxwell Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 CUTTING EDGE: When it comes to hair cuts, you've got your choice: There are 
high-tech hair salons where stylists create designs . . . and then there are 
old-fashioned places such as Pete's Barber Shop in Thousand Oaks -- where hair 
is cut, not styled (B4). Though increasingly rare, such traditional places as 
Pete's are still around, and the regulars keep coming. The biggest attraction: 
a friendly barber who greets customers by name. 
</P>
<P>
 JADE TRADE: Some jewelers are issuing warnings about inferior jade that has 
been treated to look like high-quality gems (D1). Widespread throughout Asia, 
the chemically treated stones have begun turning up in Southern California. . . 
. So far, there have been no reports of the doctored rocks in Ventura County. . 
. . Jade from California is highly prized by jewelry lovers and amateur rock 
collectors, said Bob Stultz, president of the Conejo Gem & Mineral Club. His 
advice for avoiding adulterated jade on the market: "Know who you're buying 
from."

GEORGE RAMOS: DESPITE PROP. 187, THERE IS PLENTY OF LATINO PRIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Since I wrote about the kitchen debates over Proposition 187 with Mom, with my 
brother calling her a hypocrite for supporting the measure, I've been catching 
grief from a lot of you. You obviously think I'm an ingrate son. 
</P>
<P>
 "How dare you and your brother to name your mother a hypocrite in public 
print," a lady from Upland wrote. "Whatever happened to . . . Honor Thy Father 
and Thy Mother?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You are fortunate to have a wise mother," another wrote from the Westside. 
"Too bad you and your brother don't have the 'years' experiences that she has 
had. Remember she was there when -- she is here now!! Appreciate and learn from 
her wisdom." 
</P>
<P>
 And this from L.A.: "Your mother is not a hypocrite. You can be proud of her. 
You, on the other hand, appear to wear that mantle quite comfortably." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One mother eyed me very suspiciously the other day as I was walking to the 
federal courthouse for the hearing before U.S. District Judge Matthew Byrne Jr. 
on the constitutionality of Proposition 187. I thought I was going to get yet 
another lecture about momhood but the lady from Monterey Park, who recognized 
me from one of my TV "appearances," was in too much of a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine Andrade, a 69-year-old retired nurse, said she was headed for 
Byrne's courtroom because her daughter, regional counsel Vibiana Andrade of the 
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, was part of the legal team 
challenging the measure. She wanted to be present to watch the beginning of the 
historic court battle over 187's constitutionality, but she had another reason. 
</P>
<P>
 She had never seen her daughter in action in a courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to embarrass her," she said. "I just want her to do her thing. 
But this is very important so I want to be there." 
</P>
<P>
 We arrived at the courtroom about 10 minutes before the hearing for a 
temporary restraining order was to begin, but there were no more seats in the 
spectator section. The courtroom was jammed with onlookers. Several dozen 
lawyers and out-of-town reporters begged for entry but the blue-coated security 
men said no. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrade couldn't get in either. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm the mother of one of the lawyers in there," she pleaded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too bad -- no," the blue coat replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, court officials found 16 more seats -- in the courtroom's empty 
jury box. The out-of-town reporters got in. I waved my press pass and was 
allowed in. 
</P>
<P>
 But Andrade, the proud mother, didn't make it. 
</P>
<P>
 She waited patiently outside for more than two hours while the hearing went 
forward. She said she thought about why she was there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love being Mexican," she told me later. "I love the food, I love the 
culture, I love the dress, I love the language . . . but I see an ugly America. 
It makes me feel bad because we can be wonderful people. Proposition 187 isn't 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she grew up in a small mining town in Arizona, where her family has 
lived for several generations. The mean-spirited nature of the pro-Proposition 
187 forces reminded her of the small-town prejudice she experienced back there. 
</P>
<P>
 She remembered being wrongly accused as a third-grader of stealing a 
classmate's Mickey Mouse watch. "How can you do that to a kid?" she still 
wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, she did get into the courtroom for the dramatic moment when Byrne 
issued a TRO, blocking enforcement of most of the proposition's provisions. 
"Common sense was being exercised by the judge," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To anyone within the sound of her voice, she announced, "And congratulations 
to my brilliant, wonderful daughter!" 
</P>
<P>
 I was still chuckling about meeting Vibiana Andrade's mother when I opened the 
newspaper the next morning to read about the judge's order. As I glanced 
through the paper, a familiar face -- captured in a photograph on Page 2 of The 
Times' front section -- leaped out at me. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed Ron Prince, who headed the pro-187 campaign, was talking to 
reporters after court when an elderly woman challenged him. The brief but 
heated exchange was captured by photographers. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-187 woman who went after Prince was Mrs. Andrade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes!" the daughter exclaimed later. "Yes! I'm so proud of her." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Andrade did have a final word for me: "I want to talk to your mother 
about 187. She's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Mom doesn't think so. But I'll argue the point with her, as I always do, 
when our family gets together for Thanksgiving dinner. It's the least this 
grateful and proud son can do.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TODAY'S TOPIC; 
STUDENTS SEE SCHOOLS' PROBLEMS CLEARLY, BUT WHAT ARE THE UNDERLYING CAUSES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Proposition 187, which if upheld would deny public education to illegal 
immigrant children in California, continues to unsettle campuses across the 
state. Although the proposal is tied up in the courts and most educators are 
taking a wait-and-see attitude toward it, many students are genuinely 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's Youth Opinion, a group of high school newspaper editors report that 
Proposition 187 is one of the hottest topics of discussion in the public 
schools. The issue is dividing campuses and raising unsettling questions for 
schools with large immigrant populations. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 is not, however, the only flash point for today's students. 
These youngsters cite concerns that range from overcrowded classrooms to 
inadequate library facilities, problems that result from another voter-approved 
law: the tax-slashing Proposition 13, passed in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 13's reduction in property tax receipts has brought California 
down to 32nd among the 50 states in per-pupil spending, according to U.S. 
Department of Education figures for the 1993-94 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, educators at the forefront of the movement to reform the state's 
schools do not focus on the lack of resources when discussing ways to improve 
the educational system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too easy to throw up our hands and say the sky is falling," says Mary 
Kay Tetreault, vice president for academic affairs at Cal State Fullerton. "I 
think people who are pessimistic haven't gone into a classroom recently and 
seen what teachers are doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, no one is suggesting that problems don't exist. But educators are 
recognizing that increased spending is out of the question. As a result, many 
public schools are looking at ways to make more of available resources and 
renew confidence in public education. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every single function of the school system must be focused on improved 
student learning," says Mary Chambers, executive vice president of LEARN, an 
innovative program adopted by the Los Angeles Unified School District that 
encourages more autonomy for schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "These high school students are listing the symptoms of the problem," Chambers 
says. "Decisions about the library, open or closed campuses, organization of 
the school day, those decisions ought to be made by people who have to carry 
them out and be accountable for the results." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some educators caution that it is important to set realistic goals for 
the public school system, which means accepting that not all children can, or 
even should, seek an academic degree. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to think that we can successfully influence every student into 
believing they can go to college," says Shel Erlich, a spokesman for the LAUSD. 
But "it's a little ambitious for society to believe that we as a school 
district can do that for every student," he adds. "We need to see that the 
children in our schools have goals that will put them in the mainstream of our 
economy, whether they go to college or not."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: YOUTH OPINION; 'OUR 
CAMPUS HAS BEEN REALLY DIVIDED ON PROPOSITION 187' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What are the hot issues on high-school campuses this year? JAMES BLAIR put 
that question to student newspaper editors. CLAYTON BENNETT PAYNE 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, co-editor of the Mustang, San Dieguito High School, Encinitas 
</P>
<P>
 We have to be really careful now with some of our political cartoons because 
it seems everyone's gotten really sensitive. Political correctness has gone 
beyond what I think decency is. The littlest thing will set someone off. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a cartoon drawn for a health story in the feature section talking 
about MSG and how it could be dangerous to your health and how lots of it can 
be used in Chinese food. There was a picture drawn for it of someone who was 
sick being dragged out of a Chinese restaurant. It was done in good humor and 
the artist had no idea that it could be taken wrong. The Asian community at our 
school got really offended and demanded an apology and threatened to fight to 
have us canceled. We are printing their letter in this issue. CECILIA CASTANEDA 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, managing editor of the Lancer Scroll, Bell Gardens High School 
</P>
<P>
 The hottest issue before the elections was Proposition 187. We had a walkout. 
Since it is mostly a Latino school, most of the students saw that it would 
affect them, although most were ignorant of exactly what Proposition 187 was. 
</P>
<P>
 As the newspaper staff, we felt we should educate them. We dedicated a whole 
page just to students' opinions, teachers' opinions and two editorials -- one 
pro and one con. We had a lot of facts and where students could get more 
information. A lot of students are undocumented and are concerned about their 
education and their future. Our next issue will have some follow-up information 
regarding what they can do. JENNIFER Y. WHANG 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, editor-in-chief of the Smoke Signal, West High School, Torrance 
</P>
<P>
 In past years we've been able to leave campus for lunch. This year they took 
that away from us. The reason for this is there has been trouble from others, 
students not from our school. So now it's a closed campus. Some people oppose 
it, say it's crowded and we have to wait 30 minutes for lunch. But I think it's 
actually good because we're forced together and we have to make it work. We've 
been opening up intramural sports during lunch. We did a news story and one 
staffer did an opinion piece on the new policy. SAMUEL ABORNE 
</P>
<P>
 Junior, business manager, The Shamrock, John F. Kennedy High School, La Palma 
</P>
<P>
 Our students are concerned about drugs. We ran a feature on pot and its use 
by, and affects on, students at Kennedy High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The administration found the article objectionable -- the fact that we had 
pictures of marijuana plants, that we had student testimony on pot use at our 
high school, that we did demographics on who had tried it, why they tried it, 
when they tried it and how easy they thought it would be to obtain. The 
Shamrock conducted this survey in randomly selected classes.  
</P>
<P>
 The administration got scared at the survey results, which appeared to 
indicate high usage on campus. They don't see why we covered it. STEVEN WALSH 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, editor of Esperanza Aztlan, Esperanza High School, Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 Overcrowding has got to be the main issue. We have major problems with class 
size, who's going to be where, even problems seating people. At the Esperanza 
Aztlan we've tried to display the issue of overcrowding to the students. We've 
printed pictures and written articles about the numbers in each classroom and 
the difficulties the teachers have controlling that number of students. GINA 
ALEXANDER 
</P>
<P>
 Senior, editor of La Serna Freelancer, La Serna High School, Whittier 
</P>
<P>
 Before the election the biggest issue was probably Proposition 187 because 
there's a large immigrant community at my school, almost 15%. Now we are 
getting a lot of letters about the articles we had because everyone's worried 
about it. A lot of people are still writing to ask questions and get their 
point across. Our campus has been really divided because there were a lot of 
Republicans who were totally for Pete Wilson and the proposition. Then there 
were all the people who might have to leave if it was passed. We had a whole 
section on it. Everyone was out to say how they felt about it. Everyone wanted 
to get their message across.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: SERMON; ON HOLIDAYS, 
HOLY DAYS AND A JEWISH DILEMMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MARTIN LEVIN, Martin Levin is the former rabbi of Hollywood Temple Beth El 
and Temple Knesset Israel in Los Angeles. He now heads Congregation Beth El in 
La Jolla.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Jewish calendar I saw has instructions for a dreidel cutout and a recipe for 
latkes opposite the page for December, despite the fact that this year 
Hanukkah, our Festival of Lights, begins Nov. 27, the Sunday after 
Thanksgiving. Even some of the most conscientious Jews place Hanukkah in a 
Gregorian context, thinking it always falls near the 25th of December rather 
than on the 25th of Kislev. But because the Jewish calendar is based on solar 
and lunar cycles -- this is the year 5755 for us -- Hanukkah will occur a full 
month before bearded men dressed in red and white ask our children what they 
would like for being good. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder whether Jewish families will still decorate their homes with blue and 
white and buy gifts for their children, which many say makes the end of 
December easier on our kids. It seems in only one generation we have become 
unable to separate Hanukkah from the Christmas season of gift giving, good 
cheer and decorated homes. This year we will see if these habits have become a 
permanent part of American Jewish life or mere tinsel for the Yiddishel.  
</P>
<P>
 This dilemma stems from being a citizen of both religious and secular worlds. 
We have gotten used to living by the secular calendar. We do it every Friday 
when we start Shabbat services at 6 p.m., no matter what time the sun sets. We 
do it every Sukkot when we build a sukkah but don't plan a major dinner in it 
until the weekend. We do it every Passover when we pass by the synagogue on the 
mornings after Seders and go to work instead because it's only a Tuesday and a 
Wednesday. And we do it during the spring Shavuot when we skip saying the 
yizkor memorial prayer unless it falls on a weekend. We call ourselves American 
Jews, but sometimes we find that we are becoming Jewish Americans who may 
forget to bring the menorah to the ski slopes because who can remember it's 
Hanukkah on Thanksgiving weekend? 
</P>
<P>
 In my house, we take our Shabbat candlesticks with us on vacation and my kids 
wouldn't go to school on the first and last days of Passover even if I wasn't a 
rabbi. What I really strive for is to lead a congregation that does the same 
because it would mean that we didn't fit our Jewish identity into our lives 
just when it's convenient. Instead, we would be a community of Jews who are 
proud of our identity and live it in the modern world, not in between the 
lines.

LEGAL CORPS: FILLING A LAWYER VACUUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Affordable legal services are scarce for people who earn too much to qualify 
for legal aid and too little to hire a private attorney. It's especially hard 
in South-Central Los Angeles, which has few lawyers to begin with. Enter the 
Legal Corps of Los Angeles, a nonprofit organization formed in August, 1993. 
Five paid staff lawyers and a cadre of volunteers are part of this program 
inspired by the American Bar Assn.'s Greater Access and Assistance Project, 
which is intended to encourage lawyers to do more for the working poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Eligible clients receive legal advice free of charge and litigation service 
for a flat fee of $50 plus any filing and expert fees. Legal Corps of Los 
Angeles staff are helping San Diego lawyers set up a similar operation and hope 
to expand service to the east San Fernando Valley, Wilmington and East Los 
Angeles over the next two years. LEGAL CORPS SERVICE AREA

 Corps staff works out of South-Central office space donated by the county. 
Individual and corporate donors underwrite its $300,000 annual budget. A 
network of volunteers supplements the operation's day-to-day efforts: 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Barristers, the local bar association's young lawyers' 
group, provides regular in-house support at no charge and free counsel during 
outreach events such as community law days. 
</P>
<P>
 The corps' legal advisory panel, volunteer lawyers from throughout the county, 
provide pro bono consultation to the staff from their own offices via telephone 
and fax. Volunteer lawyers are called for advice about twice each month. 
</P>
<P>
 Students from Loyola, USC, Hastings and Southwestern law schools volunteer at 
the center. Some earn college credit for their service. 
</P>
<P>
 Law firms and advisory panel attorneys offer free legal service at their 
offices for South Central small business owners referred to the Legal Corps by 
Operation Hope, Inc., a nonprofit economic development corporation. CASE STUDY 
1 
</P>
<P>
 Problem: The Browns allege that a lending institution and its agents forged 
numbers on financial documents, increasing the interest owed on their home loan 
and nearly doubling their monthly mortgage payments. They are in a legal fight 
to keep their home. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal work required so far: more than 120 hours  
</P>
<P>
 Status: While the court decides the case, an injunction allows the Browns to 
keep their home and orders them to make loan payments at their original monthly 
rate. CASE STUDY 2 
</P>
<P>
 Problem: Jose Turcios and Carlos Silva worked on the streets as mechanics for 
eight years, saving $30,000 for a down payment on a Los Angeles business site. 
They say they unknowingly purchased land that had underground gas tanks on the 
property. The partners are now embroiled in a dispute with the sellers over 
liability for the property's condition at the time of the sale. The conflict 
may jeopardize financing with a lender eager to work with the fledgling 
businessmen to improve their auto shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal work required so far: 70 hours

 It was Veterans Day, three days after the election. We had spent the holiday 
at the Los Angeles Zoo and during a dinner-table discussion of what animals we 
had seen, my wife left the table to refill our 2-year-old daughter's milk cup. 
Our son, 5, suddenly looked me right in the eye and asked with great concern, 
"Daddy, can I trust Congressman Huffington?"

 The change in topics was swift and I was momentarily stunned. His heart-felt 
question, the one posed by Dianne Feinstein's TV ads during the Senate 
campaign, showed that he'd been thinking about this for a long time. I tried to 
summon up a non-judgmental answer. "Well, he has said some things I don't agree 
with." 
</P>
<P>
 "But he hired illegal immigrants, Daddy." His eyes said more than his words. 
Someone had been caught doing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, he did." 
</P>
<P>
 With real concern in his voice, he asked. "Is he going to jail?" 
</P>
<P>
 My son's growing up. He's understanding that actions have consequences. Break 
the rules and you get put on restriction. Now my answer, in opposition to all 
he was learning: "No, I don't think so."  
</P>
<P>
 I could see his brain spinning. His voice trembled a bit and his expression 
was truly troubled as he asked plaintively, "But can I trust Dianne Feinstein?" 
</P>
<P>
 The charges and counter-charges, the words of the political ads I was so glad 
to no longer to be hearing, were still seeking closure in the mind of a dear 
little boy struggling to make sense of a world that, he is realizing, extends 
far beyond his home and the things he learns here. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ads, adult voice and images were telling him things in very certain, 
authoritative tones, although toward the end of the campaign the tones were 
actually closer to what he must experience in his kindergarten play yard: 
"Liar, liar, pants on fire." Both sets of ads sounded so convincing to him. For 
a while, his 5-year-old attention span could believe each in turn. But when 
they came at him so often he could not longer ignore the contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Repetition gives a child comfort. It establishes a pattern. The ads had done 
that. But when the pattern was suddenly gone, he became anxious. In an attempt 
to maintain the pattern and the surety that the ads had created, my son 
internalized them. That's normal. But when the internalized pattern is itself 
contradictory, it caused added anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is another, more painful, complication for my little boy. The 
pattern of the attack ads is in opposition to patterns we are attempting to 
teach him and his sister at home: honesty, respect, polite discourse with room 
for anger but not for nastiness. 
</P>
<P>
 We also try to teach him that very little of what he sees on television is 
real, with the exception of most of the news. Despite that, he still wants to 
be the blue Mighty Morphin Power Ranger when he grows up. 
</P>
<P>
 I know someday soon he will come to realize that the Power Rangers -- which he 
is permitted to watch once each week -- are pretend, although I want the time 
from now to then to pass slowly because I cherish his capacity to believe. 
</P>
<P>
 But I'm really worried about the long-term effects on him of our political 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 The people running them, and running on them, have obviously given absolutely 
no thought to the effects their campaigns are having on children. How many 
"family-values" candidates think about the lessons children are learning from 
the tones of their campaigns -- lessons these children's families and schools 
are actually trying to unteach? How many "government-can-do-good" candidates 
have any idea how their campaigns are undermining the trust of children? 
</P>
<P>
 We bemoan a cynical, angry and anxious electorate. But is it any wonder?

<P>
 Poet, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 This Thanksgiving I'm thankful for a lot of things. Some of them have to do 
with the Jan. 17 earthquake. I was living in Chatsworth with my mom when it 
hit. She was blocked inside her room and at first when I called her she 
couldn't hear me and didn't answer, so I freaked out. Then she answered and I 
knew she was all right. Our walls had tons of cracks and the carport collapsed 
on our car. Some neighbors helped us get it out. 
</P>
<P>
 For several days I was afraid they wouldn't let me go back inside to get my 
poetry. I didn't have copies of a lot of it and I don't know what I would have 
done if I'd lost it. Finally after several days all of us in my building were 
given permission to evacuate all our possessions immediately. Our building was 
condemned. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm grateful my mom and I lived through the earthquake, and I'm especially 
thankful I was able to save my poetry, because if I couldn't it would have been 
like some sort of death. I'm also thankful that I've found kindred spirits in 
the artistic community here. Their love and concern is the major reason we 
decided to stay in Los Angeles while so many others who were hard-hit by the 
quake moved away. SIMA ROSS

 As an immigrant American from Iran, I have much to be thankful for about the 
opportunities of this fantastic, young and prosperous land and the freedom it 
offers, not only for me but for my family, my friends and my people. Every year 
Thanksgiving reminds me there is hope.  
</P>
<P>
 My first year in America as a student in 1974, an older American lady took me 
to a Thanksgiving party. Since then every year I make a traditional American 
Thanksgiving dinner: a big turkey, corn, yams, and pumpkin pie for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanksgiving is the only holiday where my heart is in it. I have very strong 
sentiments for Iran, my mother is Russian, and I am Jewish. But if there is any 
land I would fight for, it is America. CHHENG HEAT LEAO

</P>
<P>
 I feel very thankful to the American people for letting my family be in this 
country, and thankful to everyone who welcomed us. I came here in 1981. 
Although I am a Buddhist, I used to go up to a church nearby and help them fix 
things, because it is my attitude to help people. My first year here the pastor 
invited my family to his home for Thanksgiving. I am also happy I can help 
other Cambodians coming here. And I have contributed to help homeless Americans 
at Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 I bring my family together for dinner. I have six children and three 
grandchildren. We have a turkey prepared in the Cambodian way, with spicy curry 
and coconut and a stuffing of soybean noodles, mushrooms and peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
 I tell the children about the Pilgrims and Indians and compare this to 
Cambodia. Because it is the Cambodian way to always welcome people from far 
away and to offer them food, like the Indians did for the Pilgrims. LUCIA

 Operatic singer, singing teacher, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 I'm thankful for having the joy of music and the joy of sharing it with others 
through teaching and singing. I began singing when I was five, standing on a 
corner in front of the Los Angeles gas station owned by my parents. People 
would come by and say "Isn't she cute?" and give me a penny or a nickel. I 
studied music in high school and later with private teachers. My Italian 
singing teacher once said to me: "An angel has breathed on your throat!" 
</P>
<P>
 But then I got married, had four children and worked in accounting and real 
estate. I missed music. After I got divorced, I eventually got back to singing. 
Music is such a joy; it's like medicine to me. I love to watch people's faces 
light up when I begin to sing. It's as if waves of love are coming back from 
the energy that's sent out by performing. I feel my voice is a gift from God so 
I'm thankful for being able to share my music. PAUL CHODAS

</P>
<P>
 I'm thankful that I and my colleague Don Yeomans were involved in the 
once-in-a-lifetime event when the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet hit the planet Jupiter 
in July. I'm thankful it was discovered a year before it hit, so we had time to 
prepare. Don and I were at the center of predicting for the rest of the 
scientific community when and where each of its 21 fragments would hit. About a 
dozen astronomers around the world measured the comet's position and gave us 
its coordinates so we could tell how fast the pieces were going. Our 
predictions weren't perfect: We were off an average of seven minutes for all 
21. 
</P>
<P>
 There were arguments about the size of the fragments; many astronomers thought 
the whole thing would be a big fizzle. But Don and I predicted the impacts 
would be much bigger, and it turned out we were right. Of course, we're 
thankful for that. 
</P>
<P>
 If the fragments had hit the Earth it would have been a global catastrophe, 
causing the death of much of the population of the world. So all of us can be 
thankful they didn't.

HEALTH BENEFITS AND DISABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I completely agree with the headline on Paul J. Feldstein's Nov. 14 
commentary, "Prop. 186's Defeat Need Not End Reform." Unfortunately, his 
recommendation to eliminate state mandates (except for requiring everyone to 
have "minimal catastrophic coverage") is likely to result in a system that 
discriminates against people with disabilities and chronic or unusual 
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because whenever benefit packages are pared down to "bare bones," they 
tend to eliminate or severely limit the very things that people with 
disabilities need most -- things like prescription drugs, rehabilitation 
services, durable medical equipment, home- and community-based long-term care 
services and mental-health benefits. In fact, Feldstein specifically mentions 
certain disability-related services (mental-health benefits and 
orthotic/prosthetic care) in the list of items that he considers "desirable" 
but unaffordable. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, at best, would "permit" people with disabilities who can afford 
coverage to pay into a system that would meet other people's health needs but 
not their own. As for those who can't afford it, they will be forced onto 
welfare just to qualify for critical services that might otherwise allow them 
to work and pay taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, Feldstein credits "low-cost managed-care insurers" for keeping 
the growth in California's per capita health spending below the growth rates 
for the United States and Canada. To those of us who have disabilities and/or 
work with the disability community, that's far from reassuring. We know that 
people with disabilities frequently have problems accessing even covered 
disability-related benefits in such managed-care plans. Erecting barriers to 
needed health services might show up on the balance sheet as a "saving" for the 
health-care system, but the effect is to deny many disabled people the right to 
an independent, productive life. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Ed Roberts, former director of the California Department of 
Rehabilitation and current president of the World Institute on Disability, 80% 
of us will experience disability at some time in our lives. California voters 
may have said no to Prop. 186, but they haven't said no to other reforms that 
will protect them when it's their turn to deal with disability. That's an 
important distinction that Feldstein, the California Legislature and Congress 
should remember as they seek new approaches for reforming our health-care 
system.

A CONSERVATION DEAL IS SLIPPING AWAY; COMPROMISE IS FAR PREFERABLE TO LOSS OF 
SOKA UNIVERSITY PARCEL IN SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tonight the board of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy is expected to 
turn its back on the best opportunity it will likely have to acquire a 
spectacular and uniquely valuable piece of property on behalf of the public it 
was created to serve. Those who reject this deal may do so out of lofty 
environmentalism or political self-interest. Either way, the result is that 
Southern Californians seeking a hiking trail or an undeveloped vista will lose 
big and possibly permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal concerns a 173-acre parcel in Calabasas currently owned by 
Japan-based Soka University. The conservancy has long sought to purchase this 
oak-studded valley expanse and its historic buildings, including the King 
Gillette Mansion, as a headquarters for visitors to the surrounding mountain 
parkland. Soka has held on to the parcel, part of its 600-acre holdings in the 
area, in the hope that the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors would 
ultimately approve its expansion plans. The university has a 200-student 
language school on the site but wants to build a liberal arts college of 3,500 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 As the conservancy and the university have alternately fought and negotiated 
over use and ownership of the parcel, land values have climbed far beyond the 
reach of the conservancy's limited financial resources. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed deal would require Soka to move its development to the east, away 
from Las Virgenes Road, and reduce its maximum enrollment to 2,500 students 
over 25 years. The conservancy, in turn, would drop a condemnation lawsuit 
seeking to acquire the land by eminent domain and buy most of the property it 
is trying to condemn for a price it can afford. The deal would take effect only 
if the Supervisors issue permits to Soka for the more limited expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing is scheduled on the lawsuit for Wednesday. But victory in court 
involves letting a jury decide what the Soka parcel is worth. If that figure is 
beyond the conservancy's means, which is quite possible, the agency would 
forfeit its right to the property and be liable for the school's legal fees. 
Then Soka could proceed as before on its ambitious development plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed deal offers a far better way to go. Most vocal in their 
opposition are local homeowners, understandably concerned about increased 
traffic along mountain roads, and some idealists who view compromise as akin to 
capitulation. But so are, quietly and inexplicably, conservancy board members 
and local politicians who helped negotiate this honorable deal and should be 
among the most supportive. This deal is not perfect, but for the recreational 
public -- the conservancy's one and only constituency -- it would represent a 
big net gain.

A BREAK IN THE FOUL WEATHER; POST-ELECTION POLITICAL DISCOURSE ACTUALLY SHOWS 
SOME SIGNS OF SUBSTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the ironies of the current political scene has surfaced in recent days. 
With all the worrisome talk about mean-spirited politics, we have in fact been 
getting some of the serious discussion we might hope for from an election. But, 
for better or for worse, that talk has come after the campaign, rather than 
during it. 
</P>
<P>
 Partisans in recent days have taken a breather from accusing each other of 
criminal-coddling and other character flaws. Republicans and Democrats have 
been staking out substantive philosophical ground. There have been some 
refreshing moments, actually, suggestive of the potential that this unwieldy 
country still holds to evaluate where it has been and where it ought to be 
going. 
</P>
<P>
 Some examples include Rep. Newt Gingrich's moment of clarity on Nov. 11. Agree 
or not with his philosophy, the Georgia Republican delivered an assessment of 
the state of big government that was coherent. On the other side of the 
political spectrum, Democrats like Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) were talking about 
coming up with new ideas to respond to a system widely seen as not working. And 
the Rev. Jesse Jackson gave a powerful assessment of the mission and 
alternatives facing his Rainbow Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 The post-mortem season offers an all-too-brief window for the examination of 
ideas and the role of government. Analysts of political advertising like 
Kathleen Hall Jamieson of the University of Pennsylvania note that contemporary 
formats for campaigns discourage the complex discussion of issues. All too 
soon, lofty ideas give way to programs for special interests, like the promised 
campaign to lift the assault weapons ban. For now, the troops of Haley Barbour, 
the Republican National Committee chairman, have won the day, and we will see 
what becomes of their "Contract With America," a set of congressional proposals 
for legislative action.  
</P>
<P>
 Before the political wars resume, we have had a taste of modern democracy's 
brief, shining interlude of self-examination. Savor the moment. What's next may 
not be as elevating.

ETHICAL TREMORS IN WORLD OF SCIENCE; PROFESSIONAL COMMUNITY ALARMED BY REPORTS 
OF DISHONESTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nothing is quite so corrosive of science as reports of fraud and misconduct by 
scientists. One expects cheating and thievery in business, where the object is 
to make money, but not in science, where the ultimate reward, ostensibly, is 
finding the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 But there have been so many allegations of scientific dishonesty lately that 
the British journal Nature observed that "outsiders can be forgiven for 
believing that science is not the honourable profession it pretends to be, but 
a mafia in which rival gangs scheme to win the credit for intellectual 
innovation." The reports have damaged the credibility of science in Congress, 
which recently set up a special commission to examine the integrity of research 
supported by the U.S. Public Health Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The time has come for the scientific community to drop its defensiveness on 
this issue. It must help determine whether misdeeds are isolated events or 
signs of a wider problem driven by underlying institutional pressures to 
publish, succeed and win research grants from the government in a highly 
competitive environment. 
</P>
<P>
 CANCER-TEST SCANDALS: Leaders of science assert that fraud is rare and that, 
in any case, the process is self-correcting because other scientists ultimately 
will discover the error when trying to replicate the work. But the steady flow 
of reports of alleged cheating is disconcerting. Earlier this year the National 
Institutes of Health were jolted by reports that some researchers had 
compromised a breast cancer study by including ineligible subjects. More 
recently, the agency has been looking into whether data was altered in a study 
of ocular cancer.  
</P>
<P>
 Scientific misconduct ranges from outright fabrication and plagiarism and the 
sabotage of others' work to the more ethically ambiguous acts of 
overinterpreting data to claim priority for an unproven idea or not giving 
sufficient credit to others. One hoary practice that should be dropped 
immediately is the use of "honorary" authorship by which a senior researcher 
puts his name on publications of disciples or co-workers even though he had 
nothing to do with the research and cannot defend it. 
</P>
<P>
 We suspect that instances of gross fraud are rare, if only because such cases 
are so easy to detect. When physicists at the University of Utah falsely 
claimed to have achieved nuclear fusion at room temperature in 1989, the 
conclusion was quickly debunked because it was so improbable. Probably the 
wider problem is that of fudging and shaving, the seemingly innocent 
corner-cutting that could pollute the scientific literature for years and is 
very hard to detect. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that there is little hard data on the true prevalence of 
misconduct. Five years ago Dr. Drummond Rennie, a professor of medicine at UC 
San Francisco, stirred a storm by proposing an experiment by which publications 
on clinical research would be checked to see whether they conformed to the raw 
data.  
</P>
<P>
 PUSH FOR SPOT CHECKS: That idea has been taken up by some members of the new 
Commission on Research Integrity, and is expected to come up at the 
commission's meeting in Washington Dec. 1 and 2. Under it, journals that 
publish original clinical research would require that scientists submit to 
random, confidential spot checks of their records. Such audits of drug research 
by the Food and Drug Administration suggest that the incidence of 
misrepresentation and sloppiness is not small. 
</P>
<P>
 Outright deception in applying for or using federal grant money is grounds for 
criminal prosecution. But federal agencies cannot police the scientific 
community. That responsibility lies mainly with universities and hospitals. 
Staffs must be monitored better and institutions must examine themselves, 
asking whether they have put such emphasis on publication as a condition for 
tenure and promotions that the very scientific truths they seek to advance are 
compromised.

CHALLENGES TO PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who's the boss -- the voters or the elected L.A. Unified School District 
officials, who refuse to execute the law (Nov. 10). Prop. 187 is the law until 
it's judged unconstitutional. Any group can spend its own money for litigation 
against 187. But LAUSD spends citizens' school taxes to fight the citizens' 
referendum decision. Any elected employee who refuses to obey the electorate -- 
on 187 or any other referendum -- should be recalled for insubordination.

<P>
 With regard to "Reading, Writing, Ruin," Nov. 9: The degraded conditions of 
the LAUSD school facilities are dramatic testimony to the distorted priorities 
of that district. How is it school board members can immediately find the 
considerable resources it will cost to pursue their challenge of the legality 
of Prop. 187 and yet continue to countenance $600 million in deferred 
maintenance? 
</P>
<P>
 The social ideologues on the school board and in the LAUSD's overblown 
bureaucracy should be thrown out of office for both their dereliction of 
responsibilities to the city's children and their cynical attempt to subvert 
the democratic process.

<P>
 Regarding "L.A. Supervisors Decline to Join Prop. 187 Challenges," Nov. 11: 
</P>
<P>
 Many voters are outraged that the proposition is being challenged because it 
signifies that their votes are not being listened to. However, although the 
majority voted for the proposition it does not signify that it is 
constitutional or just. 
</P>
<P>
 If we examine our history we will find that the majority has not always been 
right or just. Let us not forget that the majority once allowed slavery and 
that the majority once allowed segregation. It is the responsibility of those 
we elect to be the leaders of our communities to make sure that the laws the 
majority passes abide by our Constitution.

 I voted against 187 because of my concern for the health and education of the 
innocent children of illegals in California. Still, I was astonished at your 
Nov. 10 Commentary, "State's Diversity Doesn't Reach Voting Booth." What would 
better prove the cross-racial, multi-ethnic support for Proposition 187 than 
this sweeping mandate? It was less than overwhelmingly successful only (around) 
San Francisco, which is the heart of the liberal constituency, not of ethnic 
diversity. Neither support nor opposition split on racial lines.

 I'm hurt, angry and dispirited after reading Bob Scheer's Column Left (Nov. 
13). I would think that as an opinion writer at least part of his purpose would 
be to persuade those who disagree with him, but referring to people who voted 
Republican and for Prop. 187 as "good Germans" (he didn't use the word Nazi , 
but that's clearly what he meant) does not help achieve this. Liberals talk 
about tolerance and inclusiveness all the time, but they could start by 
practicing a little of it themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of 187 pushed the race issue to its absolute limits, not just using 
the normal and expected charge of racism against their political opponents, but 
going so far as to compare California to Germany in the '30s. Putting aside the 
question of whether this kind of talk is fair, or wise, the 18-point victory of 
187 shows that people will not be intimidated by it anymore. Scheer should 
realize that to maintain civilized political discourse people should be allowed 
to express their viewpoints and vote without being vilified like this.

 Nov. 9, while I was lunching near my office, a Times reporter approached me 
for my comment on Prop. 187. The next day "State's Diversity Doesn't Reach 
Voting Booth" appeared on the front page. The reporter's rendition of my 
viewpoint materialized as two paragraphs near the end of this article. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere after they departed my mouth and landed on Page A35, my opinions 
about 187 must've flown through icing. I would like everyone who read this 
article to know that I do not blame illegal immigrants for the loss of 
middle-class jobs in the region. This job loss, as everyone well knows, is 
largely due to the decline in defense and aerospace spending in California. 
Most illegal immigrants are guilty only of wanting a better life for themselves 
and their families, for which I hold them veritably blameless. 
</P>
<P>
 I do think that California's illegal immigration is a net economic drain. I 
hold this opinion because that is what has been reported to me by dispassionate 
analyses. I'd delight if it were not so. Nevertheless, it is on principle that 
I voted in favor of Prop. 187 -- the principle that people who enter a 
sovereign nation in disregard of its immigration law are not entitled to 
remain, much less tap its social benefits. I do not hold that 187 solves any 
economic problem.

HOMELESS COMPOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Dear and Jennifer Wolch ("Herding the Homeless Is An Unjust Answer," 
Commentary, Nov. 14) compassionately and incisively make the case against 
warehousing our homeless. Well-meaning as Mayor Richard Riordan is in seeking 
solutions for housing the homeless, we would hope for solutions much more 
innovative than San Diego's Draconian fortress program. 
</P>
<P>
 Approaching the homeless in this fashion isn't working in San Diego and it 
won't work here. Placing the homeless in modern concentration camps is not only 
inhumane, it doesn't respond to the causes of homelessness in the first place. 
This fortress approach does not account for the individual nature of each 
homeless person's case. Any truly effective program must include social service 
supports, individualized attention, and small scale programs or it assuredly 
will not get people out of poverty and productively back into society. It will 
only move the homeless from our sight. 
</P>
<P>
 We, as a community, have to be much more creative than this. We must begin by 
understanding what causes homelessness. It is more complex than any single, 
simple solution. It is as complex as the humans who make up its population. We 
urge Mayor Riordan and his staff to pay attention to the professionals at the 
grass-roots who are just as committed as he to solving this problem.

REPRESENTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 40 years of voting, not missing a single election, I suddenly realize 
the frightening truth. My vote doesn't count and never has! I live in Orange 
County.I'm a Democrat. I have voted in dozens of congressional, Assembly and 
state Senate contests. But there has never been a remote contest. Thus my vote 
doesn't count and never will as long as I live here. This is similarly true for 
Republicans in predominantly Democratic districts. It is true for minorities: 
blacks, Hispanics, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 Our system of winner-take-all is wrong. Only England, Canada, India, Pakistan 
and a scattering of former British colonies share this concept. Many 
alternatives exist to ensure the fair representation of minorities. The idea is 
that if, for example, Southern California has 10 representatives, then they 
should be divided according to the percentage vote. If 60% vote Republican, 30% 
Democrat, 10% Libertarian, the representation should be six Republicans, three 
Democrats, and one Libertarian. Latin America, Europe, and Ireland all have 
voting schemes designed to make each vote count. 
</P>
<P>
 Change the way votes are counted; maybe more people would vote and be less 
angry about the outcome. It would make the whole issue of redistricting and 
gerrymandering go away. It would be fair. One person, one vote that counts.

CALIFORNIA COMMENTARY; IT CAN STILL BE A GOLDEN STATE; THIS ELECTION WE GAVE 
OUR CHILDREN A CLASSIC LESSON IN HOW NOT TO RESOLVE PROBLEMS; WE MUST HEAL OUR 
WOUNDS OF DIVISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART TORRES, State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), who was a candidate for 
state insurance commissioner, is chairman of the Insurance, Claims and 
Corporations Committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Take pause, California. Look around and reflect. We have many wounds to heal. 
</P>
<P>
 The eyes of my 14-year-old daughter, Danielle, told the entire story on 
election night. The concern and fear in her eyes had less to do with her 
father's election loss than her recognition that all is not well in California; 
that an unfolding environment of racial animosity, fueled in large measure by 
Proposition 187, bodes ill for her future; that, by virtue of being Latino, 
attending a public school, she is no less suspect of the "I" word than her 
immigrant classmates. Indeed, in a world where skin color actually does matter, 
all Californians with immigrant roots are implicated by the climate we have 
created. 
</P>
<P>
 The most vocal supporters of Proposition 187 have successfully cast the 
immigrant as leech. The most vocal opponents have branded the average white 
California voter as bigot. In our collective, cathartic effort to address a 
long-ignored public-policy issue, we've scarred one another for generations to 
come. We've taken complexity and reduced it to all-or-nothing equations. We've 
given our children a classic lesson in how not to resolve problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Am I overplaying this? In 20 years of service in the California Legislature, 
I've witnessed periodic waves of racial tension that have rocked this state. If 
I had a dollar for every hate letter I've received in Sacramento targeting my 
Mexican heritage, I'd be a very rich man. And yet the fevered pitch we hear 
today is unprecedented and frightening. We're adrift. 
</P>
<P>
 But between these spouts of anger, I've also seen our periods of triumph, of 
rising above race and class to pursue a common agenda. We saw it after the Los 
Angeles riots, at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church, where black, 
brown, yellow and white came together in harmony to address a crisis. We saw it 
after the two earthquakes, north and south. 
</P>
<P>
 We have the capacity to rise above difference to move California forward. But 
we must first expunge the emotion and "politics" from the critical issues 
facing this state, such as immigration. By no means should we relax our efforts 
to curb undocumented immigration. But we need to address the issue responsibly 
and with an understanding of who we are in California. 
</P>
<P>
 We are, in fact, a state that boasts the most diverse population in the world, 
where today's minority will be tomorrow's majority. We are a state where our 
rich diversity -- combined with our proximity to our NAFTA partner Mexico, and 
at the gateway to the emerging Pacific Rim -- may well translate into our 
economic salvation. We are a state where today's voters will soon be dependent 
on the good wisdom and foresight of the future -- and ethnically diverse -- 
generation of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which presents a critical test for our state's leadership. With the 
passage of Proposition 187, we've created a national issue for which our own 
governor may well be drafted as primary spokesperson. He can build national 
political capital by ratcheting up Proposition 187-style demagoguery, inflaming 
racial tension on a national scale, or he can set a national standard for 
leadership by healing the wounds of division in his own back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter is what California desperately needs. Wilson needs to be the voice 
of leadership and unity in a state divided, and must set a standard for 
reasoned, informed debate. He needs to reach out to those within the Latino 
community, among others, who feel betrayed by his actions. He needs to 
transcend politics and work hand in hand with Sen. Dianne Feinstein to address 
immigration concerns. He needs to restore hope in a growing generation of 
disillusioned and bewildered Californians .  
</P>
<P>
 Let us embrace the change California voters have endorsed. But let us do so 
without demagoguery, hate and finger-pointing. Let us respect the rich 
diversity of our population with responsible leadership at the helm. Let us 
heal our wounds and rediscover our common ground.  
</P>
<P>
 I will reach out to the young people in this state who showed me during the 
campaign year what truth and conviction are all about. 
</P>
<P>
 My vision has not changed, no matter what perceived tidal waves appear to have 
swept over so many of us. The tide washes away, and we are left with new 
imprints to make upon the sand we call our California.

THREE STRIKES AND SHE'S OUT; KATHLEEN BROWN: BEING A WOMAN, A DEMOCRAT AND A 
BROWN PROVED TOO MUCH OF A ROADBLOCK TO THE GOVERNORSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER CARRICK, Roger Carrick was policy director for Kathleen Brown's 
campaign and is the founder of the American Environmental Institute. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kathleen Brown was drowned in the Republican tsunami at the polls this year, 
along with virtually every other Democrat seeking office. Yet, I predict that 
her agenda as a New Democrat will continue to provide the yardstick by which 
the next four years of California's political history will be measured. 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly, voters rejected the old Democrats, and they aren't sure yet what a 
New Democrat is. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats are now challenged to demonstrate that their contemporary version of 
John F. Kennedy's legacy still works. Kennedy's vision was of a strong but 
limited government that protected the people through sustainable private 
economic growth, social justice and international human-rights leadership. 
Democrats must demonstrate the utility today of this political value system. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Brown understood that Democrats must rekindle the public's optimism 
that we can now define market-driven solutions in an international economy 
marked by technological change coming at warp speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown argued that we must recalibrate to accept the success of Kennedy's 
vision. She pointed to the extraordinary development of strong Latino, African 
American, white and Asian middle-class families in America who were nurtured by 
Democratic ideals and programs. 
</P>
<P>
 She wanted to rebuild California for them through a smaller government that is 
tough enough to protect, yet nimble enough to promote growth in the private 
sector, primarily by advancing educational excellence. Her vision was simple, 
perhaps too simple for those yearning for a return to a political Camelot that 
never was. Yet her vision remains California's challenge today. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual story of Kathleen Brown in this election was her three fundamental 
challenges -- as a woman, a Democrat and a Brown.  
</P>
<P>
 Initially, her public identity was just a creation of polls and profiles of 
her celebrity family status. As the real Kathleen Brown emerged, we met a woman 
of deep conviction confronting a cynical, political landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Her voice of moral courage was lonely in the beginning. She was among the 
first to denounce the popular but deadly virus of Proposition 187. She then 
honestly stated her views on the death penalty, going against the majority 
view. She nonetheless persuaded many of us who support the death penalty that 
she would carry out the people's will. A corny, honest, but electorally damning 
position.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet Brown was then vilified by her Republican opponent as either weak or 
unschooled. Brown met this "re-machoization" of American politics head-on. She 
called for cutting government waste and lowering taxes. She demanded that 
government protect the environment while fostering economic growth. She argued 
that kindergartners and teachers, who we pay less than prison guards, should 
not be used to balance our chronic state budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one appeared to believe her on these issues. Why? 
</P>
<P>
 Because Kathleen Brown was also a Democrat, in a year when Democrats were 
nationally in retreat and near-disrepute. The accepted wisdom was that 
Democrats can't cut government, can't cut taxes and can't reorient their allies 
in the environmental and labor movements to accept new ideas of growth and 
workplace changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, President Clinton has accomplished just these missions. 
Nonetheless, Brown's straightforward proposals to advance these goals in 
California were swept away in the vast skepticism of anything Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
 If that wasn't enough, she was also a Brown. The health of her father, the 
legendary Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, California's governor from 1958-66, 
unfortunately precluded his participation in her campaign. Her brother, Jerry 
Brown, California's last Democratic governor, has been marginalized in the 
1990s. As political assets, they were wanting. Yet she melded the economic 
growth strategy of her father and the environmental stewardship of her brother. 
Kathleen Brown, like her brother and father before her, believes ideas matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The force of Brown's ideas was demonstrated when a majority of the Los Angeles 
Times' own focus group moved from supporting Pete Wilson to backing her upon 
receiving a copy of her plan for rebuilding California.  
</P>
<P>
 All we ultimately learned is that you can still scare most of the people some 
of the time, especially if you spike their fears with near naked appeals to 
racial animosity and xenophobia. I grew up in North Carolina and have listened 
to Jesse Helms all my adult life. I know well how fear and hate works in 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has unleashed a whirlwind in California with Proposition 187. Coupled 
with the ascension of Jesse Helms to the role of foreign-policy leadership in 
the Senate, Wilson's tactical goal of dividing our state by who carries an 
identification card may now drive the national debate into a stark politics of 
division. This hardly represents a formula for building in our multicultural 
land the successful new economy and civil society needed in the international 
21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Brown , as her father and brother before her, stood for a vision of 
building a state for all the people, of investing in people to enable them to 
improve their own lives, of believing that while each of us is sacred, we can 
accomplish more together than we can apart.

CLIPPERS ALMOST WIN ONE; PRO BASKETBALL: THEY LOSE LEAD THEN NINTH GAME IN A

<P>
 Coach Bill Fitch is getting tired of answering questions about why the 
Clippers are the NBA's only winless team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a big step if we won because then I'd get some other questions," 
Fitch said Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch's players were about eight seconds away from silencing the questioners, 
but they couldn't finish off the New Jersey Nets, who extended the Clippers' 
season-opening losing streak to nine games by defeating them, 98-97, before 
11,670 at the Brendan Byrne Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we led them for most of the game, there was no moral victory 
here," said guard Terry Dehere, who had 16 points. "A loss is a loss." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers had the lead for most of the game, then with 7.7 seconds 
remaining New Jersey forward Armon Gilliam dunked off a pass from guard Kenny 
Anderson to give the Nets a one-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been embarrassing to lose to the Clippers, especially the way 
we played," Gilliam said. "We came out and we were going through the motions." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers called a timeout to set up a play, but forward P.J. Brown blocked 
Pooh Richardson's layup as time expired. Richardson had the option of driving 
and passing to center Elmore Spencer or driving and kicking the ball out to 
Dehere. But Spencer, who had 15 points and 10 rebounds, was covered so 
Richardson took the last shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is tough, but we've got to find a way to get through it," said 
Richardson, who had 19 points, 12 assists and seven rebounds. "I thought we 
played well enough to win it tonight. We finally put four quarters of 
basketball together. Everything we did was the right thing. At least now we're 
getting the hang of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch said Richardson ran the play the way it was designed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Richardson was one shot away from having the big play of the night," Fitch 
said. "I thought Pooh did a good job running the play. We could have used one 
less turnover. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disappointing as hell. When you get in a situation like this, you've got 
all the baggage that goes with the streak. We've played a couple games now 
where we're at another level and we're still losing. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the toughest level, when you get to that level, where you're just good 
enough to lose and you're not quite tough enough to win." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who led by as many as 15 points, played well until the fourth 
quarter, limiting All-Star forward Derrick Coleman to 10 points in the first 
three quarters. But Coleman, who finished with 20 points and 14 rebounds, 
scored 10 points and grabbed seven rebounds in the fourth quarter as New Jersey 
outscored the Clippers 24-16. 
</P>
<P>
 After shooting 46.1% in the first three quarters, the Clippers shot 27% in the 
final quarter, missing 19 of 26 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson, who made eight of 21 shots, missed six of seven in the final 
quarter. Forward Loy Vaught, who made five of 20, missed all five shots he took 
in the final quarter. Vaught, who had 10 points and eight rebounds, made only 
one of 12 shots in the second half.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the Clippers lost a game they should have won, they might have found 
a way to motivate Spencer, who had averaged 6.6 points and 3.5 rebounds.  
</P>
<P>
 Fitch made his first lineup change of the season, starting rookie Matt Fish at 
center in place of Spencer. Fish struggled, getting only two points and one 
rebound, but Spencer seemed more relaxed in a reserve role, making six of 11 
shots. Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Former Clipper forward Dominique Wilkins, who signed with the Boston Celtics 
last July, predicted that the Clippers will break the NBA record for most 
losses in a season that was established when the Philadelphia 76ers went 9-73 
in 1972-73. "I think that they're going to set the record, I honestly do," 
Wilkins said. "They've had four or five lottery picks in the last five or six 
years and not one of them is here. What does that tell you? That's got to be 
the first time in history that it's happened." Although most NBA insiders think 
the Clippers have a good shot at breaking the record, Wilkins was the first to 
put it on the record. . . . The game was a homecoming for Clipper Coach Bill 
Fitch, who coached the Nets for three seasons.

NETS SLAM DOOR ON CLIPPERS; PRO BASKETBALL: ARMON GILLIAM'S DUNK WITH 7.7

 Armon Gilliam took a fast-break pass from Kenny Anderson and dunked over two 
defenders with 7.7 seconds to play Sunday night, giving the New Jersey Nets a 
98-97 victory over the winless Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nets, who won their third in a row at home, rallied from a 15-point 
third-period deficit and handed the Clippers their ninth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Derrick Coleman had 20 points and 14 rebounds, Anderson had 20 points and 10 
assists, Chris Morris added 14 points and Gilliam 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Pooh Richardson led the Clippers with 19 points, while Tony Massenburg and 
Terry Dehere each had 16 while Elmore Spencer added 15. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey entered the fourth quarter trailing, 81-74, but reeled off the 
first eight points of the period to take their second lead of the game. The 
Nets didn't lead again until Gilliam's game-winning basket. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers broke a 91-91 tie with baskets by Massenburg and Spencer, but a 
free throw by Morris and a dunk by Coleman closed the gap to 95-94 with 1:33 to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 A short jumper by Spencer gave the Clippers their final points 22 seconds 
later. With 33.3 remaining, Kevin Edwards pulled the Nets within a point with 
two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson missed a three-point shot from the top of the key with 13 seconds 
to play, and Coleman rebounded. He passed to Anderson, who pushed it upcourt 
and fed Gilliam coming down the left side. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilliam powered his way between Richardson and Dehere to score the 
game-winner. Richardson's desperation driving shot just before the buzzer was 
swatted away by P.J. Brown.

<P>
 There's absolutely no money like the kind of money they're throwing around 
today in the made-for-television segment of the pro golf tour, the one brought 
to you by Fred Couples, directed by Fred Couples, starring Fred Couples. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent Sunday at Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks, dropping putts and 
picking up $300,000, which he split with partner Brad Faxon after they shot 58 
and won the Franklin Funds Shark Shootout by one stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fun," Couples said. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, it's sort of a Fred World right now. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's check the bank statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Couples collected $250,000 by winning the World Cup in Puerto 
Rico, playing with Davis Love III. Last week, Couples made $180,000 after 
winning at Kapalua, Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Add his $150,000 share of the winners' purse Sunday, and Couples has made 
$580,000 the last three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 This makes Couples the official leader in the unofficial money sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, it's a fair amount, acknowledged Couples, who in three weeks on the 
special event circuit has almost matched the $625,654 he earned this year in 15 
events on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to say I'm Jack Nicklaus, but when you win they give you money," 
Couples said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nowadays, it's a lot of money. Let's put it this way. I would certainly be 
disappointed if I finished second and still got a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 The second-place check went to Curtis Strange and Mark O'Meara, who split 
$170,000 after shooting 58 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 They even led, briefly, after they birdied the 17th hole to take a one-shot 
lead while Couples and Faxon were at No. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 But Couples rolled in a 12-footer for a birdie on the par-three 15th, then 
made a 10-footer for eagle on the par-five 16th. 
</P>
<P>
 The 58 from the Couples-Faxon duo was three short of the Shootout record for 
the scramble day of competition and their 72-hole score of 190 is eight shots 
off the tournament record, but who's counting? 
</P>
<P>
 Couples and Faxon have other things to count. They probably did it on their 
way to Las Vegas, where they decided to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 The way things are going for Couples, it's probably the perfect place to be 
right about now. 
</P>

 Greg Norman, who left Sunday night for a vacation in Australia, won't be 
taking part in a meeting between officials of the PGA Tour and World Golf Tour 
on Tuesday in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 John Montgomery Jr., executive director of the new tour, said in a statement 
Sunday he was encouraged by the PGA Tour's willingness to negotiate some sort 
of working arrangement. The World Tour, to which the PGA Tour is opposed, is 
scheduled to begin in 1995 with eight $3-million tournaments, four in the 
United States. The eight events are to be televised by Fox.

TENNIS ROUNDUP; SAMPRAS OVERCOMES BECKER IN FINALE OF 1994 ATP TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Top-ranked Pete Sampras survived a barrage of aces Sunday and defeated Boris 
Becker, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5, 6-4, at Frankfurt, Germany, to win his second IBM/ATP 
Tour World Championship title. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras, who also won in 1991, became the first two-time champion since the 
inception of the tour-ending event in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "This ends the year on a great note," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras earned $1.225 million for his victory against Becker, who rose two 
places to No. 3 in the rankings despite the loss. Sampras increased his 1994 
winnings to $3,607,812. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras lost his serve only once, in the first set. Once he broke Becker in 
the second set, he took command of the match. 
</P>
<P>
 The critical moment came in the sixth game, when Becker served five 
double-faults and suffered his first break. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't explain what happened," Becker said. "I lost my touch for five 
minutes and he took advantage of the opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras had lost to Becker in two sets in the round-robin portion of the 
tournament, and had lost to him at the Stockholm Open three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He advanced from the round-robin group only after Becker beat Stefan Edberg on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to thank you, Boris, for letting me be here," Sampras told Becker 
after the awards ceremony. 
</P>

 Gabriela Sabatini's 2 1/2-year search for a title ended in triumph when she 
won the Virginia Slims Championships at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long time," Sabatini said. "I've had a lot of frustration, a lot 
of tough matches that I lost." 
</P>
<P>
 The Argentine, playing in her 44th tournament since last winning a final, 
overcame 12 double-faults to defeat mistake-prone Lindsay Davenport of 
Murrieta, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to know my game is not lost, that it's still good enough to win," 
said Sabatini, whose victory was worth $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Since winning the Italian Open in May 1992, Sabatini had reached seven finals 
without success. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Davenport: "Gaby has had a tough two years. If I had to lose to someone, 
I'm glad it was Gaby."

BROWNS' EARLY TURNOVER THE TURNING POINT; AFC: FIRST-QUARTER FUMBLE BY RYPIEN 
GIVES CHIEFS NEW LIFE AND HELPS THEM WIN, 20-13. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Do not look at the Cleveland Browns' 142 yards in 15 penalties or Kimble 
Anders' go-ahead touchdown as the key in the undermanned Kansas City Chiefs' 
20-13 victory on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Check Mark Rypien's fumble at the Kansas City six in the first quarter as a 
pounding rain turned Arrowhead Stadium's new grass field into slop. It wasted 
Mark Carrier's 60-yard punt return and gave the Chiefs new life in a victory 
that tightened two AFC races. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to see a turning point, it was after the long punt return and we 
came away and got the ball back," said Chief Coach Marty Schottenheimer. "As 
early as it was, I thought that was the turning point in the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs (7-3), who were without seven starters, crept within a game of the 
San Diego Chargers in the AFC West and dropped the Browns (8-3) into a 
first-place tie with the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Rypien said the fumble was caused when center Steve Everitt gave him a bad 
snap and resulted from the same trickery the Chiefs used to induce all the 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 "He saw the nose tackle flinch and snapped the ball as he's been told to do, 
and I wasn't expecting it," Rypien said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns were driving in the final minute when Derrick Thomas sacked Rypien 
and stripped the ball. The ball was recovered by Pellom McDaniels at the Chief 
48 and Kansas City ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the Chiefs' wounded were their best running back (Marcus Allen), 
offensive lineman (John Alt), wide receiver (Willie Davis) defensive lineman 
(Neil Smith) and defensive back (Mark Collins). 
</P>
<P>
 "We were confident that if we would play the game the way we're capable of 
playing, we had players who could perform in a winning fashion," Schottenheimer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns scored their first touchdown in Arrowhead Stadium in four games and 
took a 13-10 lead late in the third quarter on Rypien's 15-yard pass to Michael 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Lin Elliott's 28-yard field goal tied the score at 13-13 only 53 seconds into 
the fourth quarter. Then, with rookie running backs Donnell Bennett and Greg 
Hill supplying most of the muscle on a rainy day when quarterbacks had trouble 
gripping the ball, the Chiefs went 69 yards in nine plays and scored a second 
touchdown in a game for the first time in four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill and Bennett carried on seven consecutive plays until a wild scene ensued 
at the two. Anders recovered his own fumble on third and one at the two, but 
two unsportsmanlike-conduct penalties on the Browns made it first down. Anders 
carried across the middle for the go-ahead score. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look at the stats and you tell me about the officiating," said safety 
Eric Turner. "It seemed like every penalty we got was offset by one of theirs. 
I would like to see their definition of pass interference. It's awful 
frustrating when you feel things aren't going fairly or evenly." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown Coach Bill Belichick called it "our worst game of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Belichick: "We made way too many mistakes. We made enough errors to last 
us two or three games. Penalties and turnovers were the key factors. We just 
didn't get the job done in every aspect of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The lackluster Cleveland offense sprang to life in a five-play, 65-yard march 
late in the third period that was capped by Rypien's go-ahead touchdown pass to 
Jackson. Taking Rypien's pass over the middle, Jackson beat Jay Taylor, 
Collins' backup, then strained across the goal line.

COLTS GIVE BENGALS' BLAKE A LESSON IN REALITY, 17-13 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Blake's luck finally ran out Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cincinnati Bengals' remarkable quarterback tried for one more big play in 
the final minute, but Ray Buchanan denied him another storybook ending. 
Buchanan intercepted in the end zone with 45 seconds left to clinch the 
Indianapolis Colts' 17-13 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Buchanan came away with his third interception on the type of play that has 
made Blake a phenomenon: a jump ball to Darnay Scott. Until the closing minute, 
the play had worked for Blake almost every time. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been coming down with the ball the past couple of weeks," Buchanan 
said. "They have very talented receivers who can jump and challenge for the 
ball when it's up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He kind of threw it up for grabs and it was let the best man get the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Buchanan was the best man on the decisive play, although the Bengals thought 
he also was a very lucky man. He and Scott jostled for position as the ball was 
in the air, and the Bengals assumed the cornerback would be flagged. 
</P>
<P>
 Buchanan thought he did nothing wrong. He wasn't surprised when no flags flew. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't push him," Buchanan said. "I turned around and looked for the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 After struggling on offense all afternoon, the Colts (5-6) finally made some 
plays in the closing minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Majkowski, playing with a torn ligament in the thumb of his passing hand, 
completed three consecutive passes to move the Colts down the field. He then 
read the Bengals' coverage and threw an eight-yard touchdown pass to Sean 
Dawkins with 1:54 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The 62-yard drive was the longest of the day behind Majkowski, who injured his 
hand two weeks ago. He completed 14 of 24 passes for 165 yards without an 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake, playing on a bruised left ankle, completed 21 of 37 passes for 207 
yards, his least-productive game in four starts. But he had the Bengals in 
position for a third victory in a row after he led them on a nearly nine-minute 
drive in the third quarter. His 15-yard touchdown pass to Scott put them ahead, 
13-7.

STEELERS-DOLPHINS WORTHY OF A SEQUEL; AFC: PITTSBURGH WINS IN OVERTIME ON 
ANDERSON'S FIELD GOAL, BUT PLAYERS SAY THEY EXPECT TO MEET AGAIN IN THE 
PLAYOFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Gary Anderson's 39-yard field goal spun between the yellow uprights just 
ahead of darkness Sunday, the participants in this most brutal of football 
games did a most unusual thing. 
</P>
<P>
 They met one another at midfield. And they hugged. 
</P>
<P>
 They patted each other's helmets, clutched the dirty tape on each other's 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys were congratulating each other on such a tremendous game," said Steeler 
cornerback Rod Woodson. "And we were telling each other, 'We'll see you again.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 He is referring to the playoffs, which can't possibly feel much different than 
the Pittsburgh Steelers' 16-13 overtime victory over the Miami Dolphins before 
59,148 at Three Rivers Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The game between arguably the AFC's two best teams was nearly 3 1/2 hours of 
pushing and shoving and desperation, culminating with 23 minutes of the sort of 
suspense that caused both helmets and curses to fly. 
</P>
<P>
 In a span of one quarter and an overtime period: 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins led . . . then the Steelers led . . . then Dan Marino worked 62 
more yards of magic to tie the game . . . then Marino was stopped . . . then 
the Steelers finally won with Anderson's kick with 4:41 to play in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, the roar of the black-shirted crowd beneath the darkening skies had 
brought the emotion to such a pitch, Steeler quarterback Mike Tomczak was 
thankful to leave the field and let Anderson try to win the game on first down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was glad he came out there," Tomczak said. "I had to go to the bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
 The moment the kick was good -- Anderson's 14th field goal in 14 attempts from 
39 yards or less -- the power in the AFC shifted. 
</P>
<P>
 With Cleveland's defeat in Kansas City coupled with Pittsburgh's earlier 
victory over the Browns, the Steelers lead the Central Division with an 8-3 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 With San Diego's defeat in New England, the Steelers have joined the Chargers 
and Browns as owners of the best record in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins, meanwhile, must be content to lead the AFC East with a 7-4 
record and three of their final five games at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here 2 1/2 years, and I can honestly say it may be one of the best 
victories I've been associated with," said Steeler Coach Bill Cowher, his eyes 
red and watery. "To be down, to be counted out, to show the resiliency that 
they showed today. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 In the other locker room, Dolphin linebacker Bryan Cox was livid. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no miracles. There was no magic," he said. "I'm surprised at how 
bad we played when the game was on the line." 
</P>
<P>
 With 12 minutes remaining, with the Dolphins leading 10-6, the Steelers began 
a drive on their 27-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Their offense had not scored a touchdown since before Halloween, a span of 13 
quarters and two overtime periods. 
</P>
<P>
 Their quarterback was Tomczak, starting his second game in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 They had gained a total of 21 yards in the second half.  
</P>
<P>
 "Football is a funny game," Steeler tackle John Jackson said. "Just when you 
think you're not there, something clicks." 
</P>
<P>
 This time it was Tomczak clicking with Ernie Mills on a 40-yard lob that Mills 
chased down like a center fielder. Four plays later Barry Foster barreled 10 
yards up the middle for a touchdown that, with the extra point, gave the 
Steelers a 13-10 lead midway through the fourth quarter. And set the stage for 
another Marino comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 After being chased around for most of the game by the league's fifth-ranked, 
and hardest-hitting, defense, Marino suddenly led the Dolphins on a nine-play, 
62-yard drive that began on the Miami 7-yard line with 1:53 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 With two rushers closing in, Marino found third-stringer Scott Miller for 27 
yards across the middle. Moments after having a pass tipped, he found Irving 
Fryar for 15 yards down the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 With five seconds remaining, Pete Stoyanovich, who missed an earlier field 
goal, calmly trotted out and tied the game with a 48-yard field goal that sent 
the Steelers into a rage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very, very tense out there," Steeler safety Carnell Lake said. 
</P>
<P>
 That tension increased during overtime, after the Steelers' Levon Kirkland 
apparently knocked a ball from Marino's hands and ran it 45 yards for a 
touchdown. But the officials ruled that Marino had been in Joel Steed's grasp. 
</P>
<P>
 On the next play, Marino apparently hit O.J. McDuffie on the Steeler 20, but 
officials ruled that McDuffie dropped the ball as he was falling to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he caught it," said Dolphin Coach Don Shula, a rules committee 
member who might use this play to push for the return of instant replay. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this set up the winning 66-yard drive that featured Tomczak running 
around the backfield like a madman and throwing crazy passes . . . that were 
caught. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster rumbled for 27 yards with one of them. John L. Williams gained 23 yards 
after catching another. 
</P>
<P>
 On this day, and under these circumstances, Anderson's kick was the least of 
the Steelers' worries. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they must decide whether Tomczak will replace injured Neil O'Donnell (hip, 
ankle) next week against the Raiders in Los Angeles, even though O'Donnell is 
expected to be sound. 
</P>
<P>
 And whether this type of effort can lead them to a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we need," Jackson said, "is one more click."

TURNER HELPS JETS PICK OFF WIN; INTERCONFERENCE: FORMER BRUIN HAS THREE 
INTERCEPTIONS, RETURNS ONE 90 YARDS IN A 31-21 VICTORY OVER VIKINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Marcus Turner has done this before. Three interceptions, one of them a 90-yard 
touchdown return. He's done it many times. 
</P>
<P>
 In his dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, a career backup playing as an extra defensive back, scored on a 
deflected pass on the opening drive and intercepted two other Warren Moon 
passes as the New York Jets defeated the Minnesota Vikings, 31-21, on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of those games you think about as a kid, when you're walking home 
from school tossing the ball to yourself," said Turner, who went to Long Beach 
Jordan High and UCLA. "You think, 'Ooh, I've got three interceptions. Four. 
Five.' You'd take it to 10 if you could, but you never think you'll really have 
a day like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, who has only two starts in six seasons, turned his daydreams into 
reality in time to put the Jets (6-5) back in the race in the AFC East. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Miami Dolphins' overtime loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday, 
the Jets and Buffalo Bills are tied for second. New York already has beaten the 
Bills twice, and can grab a share of first when the Dolphins visit the 
Meadowlands next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to feel real good after this," said Jet linebacker Mo Lewis. "We've 
just got to stay focused now." 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota (7-4), considered a Super Bowl contender two weeks ago, was upset by 
an AFC East team for the second week in a row. The Vikings dropped into a 
first-place tie with the Chicago Bears in the NFC Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were never in sync the whole game," said Minnesota safety Vencie Glenn. 
"My momma said there would be days like this, but we'll bounce back." 
</P>
<P>
 James Hasty also had an interception for the Jets, who turned another huge day 
by Moon into another upset loss for the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 Moon completed 33 of 50 passes for 400 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 New York, which started the season 2-3, has pulled into playoff contention 
with an opportunistic defense that has forced 20 turnovers in the last six 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 All four interceptions came at critical times against the Vikings, who lost 
for the first time in five games at the Metrodome this season and were booed 
loudly. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, signed by the Jets as a Plan B free agent from the Arizona Cardinals 
in 1992, grabbed his first at the Jets' 10 after a high pass bounced off the 
hands of tight end Adrian Cooper. He went untouched up the sideline for a 7-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's second came in the end zone with 26 seconds to play in the half and 
the Jets leading, 17-14. Minnesota had driven to the New York 25, but Moon 
forced a pass to Cris Carter in double coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner started for injured cornerback Aaron Glenn in last week's loss against 
the Green Bay Packers. Glenn returned against the Vikings, but Turner played 
often against Minnesota's wide-open offense.

 They fight like children on the sidelines and bicker across the radio dial. On 
the field, though, Jim Kelly and Andre Reed are always together. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly and Reed connected for two touchdowns and 191 yards on Sunday to defeat 
Green Bay, 29-20, and revive the Bills' playoff hopes. Buffalo (6-5) snapped a 
two-game losing streak and handed the Packers (6-5) their first loss in four 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly, who had a swollen hand and didn't practice until Friday, completed 32 
of 44 passes for 365 yards -- his best output in 2 1/2 years and the 
fourth-best of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed had a team-record 15 catches and a career best in yardage one game after 
Kelly screamed at him on the sideline for missing an assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to argue a little more," Reed joked. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the two have connected for 56 touchdowns and are tied for fourth 
best in NFL history and second best among active tandems. San Francisco's Steve 
Young and Jerry Rice, who had three against the Rams, now have 57. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're quite a combination," Buffalo Coach Marv Levy said of Kelly and Reed. 
"And I can't tell you how good they are for our team." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Kelly: "When he gives 100% each and every play, he's unstoppable. 
Hopefully we can do that each and every week." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly upbraided Reed on the sideline Monday night during the Bills' 23-10 loss 
to the Steelers, when Reed admitted missing some audibles because of the crowd 
noise. Kelly was also upset that Reed failed to see a blitz that led to a sack, 
fumble and Pittsburgh touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 On Reed's Tuesday night radio show, he said he wished Kelly had approached him 
in private so they could work it out, saying, "Don't act like a fool on 
national TV." 
</P>
<P>
 But the two said they had put the feud behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Sunday, they showed they really have. Kelly connected with Reed on 
touchdown pass plays of 15 and 10 yards in the first half as the Bills moved 
out to a 24-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very brief flareup in temper and it was forgotten," Levy said. 
"There are tempers in the game, the guy's getting battered around, he got upset 
and it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Reed: "We didn't get (this far) by arguing. I think Jim has enough 
confidence in me . . . that when it's put-up or shut-up time, and it's time to 
get the ball downfield and make the first down, when it's third and five or 
third and six, he's looking to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the confidence we have in each other. And I've got to come up and make 
the play. That's what I get paid to do. I relish that, because I feel I'm the 
guy they have to go to when it's like that. And that's what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Packer Coach Mike Holmgren said, "Reed had one of the great games I've ever 
seen a receiver have. He's a very talented man and he had one of those days." 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Favre and Sterling Sharpe connected for two touchdowns and Edgar Bennett 
caught another as Green Bay made it 27-20, but the Packers failed in three 
attempts to get closer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers lost defensive end Reggie White in the third quarter with a 
sprained left elbow. Holmgren said he would be day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
 For Buffalo, defensive end Bruce Smith, who had a bruised shoulder, did not 
play.

CARDINAL DEFENSE STOPS EAGLES, 12-6; NFC: ARIZONA SACKS CUNNINGHAM FOUR TIMES 
AND WINS SECOND CONSECUTIVE GAME FOR FIRST TIME THIS SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Arizona Cardinals, who complained about bad breaks in a 17-7 loss to 
Philadelphia two weeks ago, made their own breaks this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about it from the outset -- putting together a 60-minute game. You 
know, not going out and playing well for a little while here and there," Seth 
Joyner said Sunday after Phoenix defeated Philadelphia, 12-6. Joyner had two of 
the four sacks on Eagle quarterback Randall Cunningham as Phoenix made four 
field goals by Greg Davis stand up. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Joyner said, "we were going to go out and put together a 60-minute game 
and play the way that we know we can play -- swarm to the ball, play smart 
football, and let the chips fall where they may." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a sweet victory for Cardinal Coach Buddy Ryan, who succeeded in his 
second try at beating the team he coached to three consecutive playoff 
appearances from 1988-90. It also marked the first time this season the 
Cardinals (5-6) won consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles (7-4) dropped their second in a row thanks to Ryan's defense. 
Arizona allowed 79 yards through the first three quarters and 185 for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was a negative, it was Arizona's inability to score a touchdown on 
three drives inside the Eagles' 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona lost two offensive keys in the first half when tackle Luis Sharpe and 
wide receiver Randal Hill were sidelined because of leg injuries. But its luck 
changed in the third quarter, when Herschel Walker's 96-yard kickoff return was 
called back because of a holding penalty on Rich Miano. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals got another break when Fred Barnett dropped a pass inside the 
Arizona 10 early in the fourth quarter and Philadelphia settled for Eddie 
Murray's 30-yard field goal with 11:41 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray's field goal cut Arizona's lead to 9-6, and the Cardinals couldn't move 
on the next possession. But the defense took over. 
</P>
<P>
 After Philadelphia got one first down, Cunningham scrambled out of the pocket, 
then lateraled to Walker. A hard tackle by Terry Hoage knocked the ball loose, 
and Aeneas Williams recovered on the Cardinal 42. 
</P>
<P>
 After the fumble, Jay Schroeder directed a 37-yard drive ended by Davis' 
39-yard field goal with 5:16 to play. Davis' other three field goals were from 
24 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles put together a desperation drive, sparked by Charlie Garner's 
21-yard sweep on fourth and inches. But Eric Swann stopped Walker for a 
one-yard loss at the Arizona 24, Calvin Williams was out of bounds on a 
end-zone catch, and Cunningham threw incomplete on third and fourth down.

COWBOYS WIN BUT LOSE AIKMAN; NFC: QUARTERBACK SUFFERS SPRAINED KNEE, OUT THREE 
TO FOUR WEEKS. BACKUP PEETE ALSO HURT IN 31-7 VICTORY OVER REDSKINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The NFL champion Dallas Cowboys, hounded by adversity even when they win, lost 
two quarterbacks in one game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy Aikman, playing with a sore passing thumb and a broken nose, went down 
with a sprained left knee in Sunday's 31-7 victory over the Washington Redskins 
and probably will be sidelined three to four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman had a magnetic resonance imaging test Sunday night that showed a medial 
collateral sprain, and he was examined by Dr. Robert Vandermeer. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cowboy owner Jerry Jones: "His statement to me was probably three to four 
weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 If Aikman's injury wasn't bad enough, backup Rodney Peete sprained the thumb 
on his passing hand and was replaced by third-stringer Jason Garrett. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Aikman had a sprained knee, he missed five games in 1991 and 
Dallas got knocked out of the playoffs by the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 Peete responded with a touchdown pass and Emmitt Smith ran for two touchdowns 
as Dallas, coming off a 21-14 loss to San Francisco last week, notched its 13th 
consecutive NFC East victory. Smith rushed for 85 yards and went over 1,000 for 
the fourth consecutive season. He has 1,074. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman was hurt in the second quarter when he was tackled around the knees by 
linebacker Ken Harvey. Aikman called timeout, limped to the sidelines, then 
accompanied Cowboy doctors to the locker room. Wearing a knee brace, Aikman was 
taken to a hospital for the MRI. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he was hurt, Aikman completed eight of 13 passes for 87 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 After the injury, Peete threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to Alvin Harper to give 
Dallas a 24-7 halftime lead. Kevin Williams then dashed 83 yards on a punt 
return for a touchdown as Washington's record dipped to 2-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Peete jammed his thumb in the third quarter when hit by defensive end Dexter 
Nottage. Peete could barely grip the ball after the injury, but X-rays of the 
thumb were negative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll know more about my injury (today)," Peete said. "I'm worried about the 
ligament. I want to play Thursday. I just hope I can." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys (9-2) also lost guard Derek Kennard with a toe injury and 
linebacker Godfrey Myles with a knee injury during the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ugly for the Cowboys right now," said guard Nate Newton, who also was 
hurt. "It's an epidemic." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington trickery backfired after Brian Mitchell returned the opening 
kickoff 66 yards to the Dallas 23. On second down, Mitchell tried a halfback 
pass, but cornerback Kevin Smith intercepted in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys drove 80 yards in 10 plays, with Smith scoring on an eight-yard 
run on which he carried linebacker Andre Collins the last two yards. 
</P>
<P>
 After a missed 53-yard field goal, Dallas went 56 yards, with Smith scoring on 
a three-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Then James Washington intercepted a Gus Frerotte pass and returned it 15 yards 
to the Washington 20. Chris Boniol kicked a 32-yard field goal for a 17-0 
first-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redskins used three quarterbacks -- Frerotte, John Friesz and Heath Shuler 
-- meaning six quarterbacks played in the game.

SEAHAWKS' STRONG LEAVES BUCCANEERS FEELING WEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years ago, Mack Strong was Garrison Hearst's unsung blocker in Georgia's 
backfield. On Sunday, he was the Seattle Seahawks' unsung hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong scored on a seven-yard run with 42 seconds left and John Kasay's extra 
point gave Seattle a 22-21 comeback victory over Tampa Bay before the smallest 
non-strike crowd in the Seahawks' 19-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 37,466 fans showed up -- there were 17,234 no-shows -- in the Kingdome. 
They saw the Buccaneers come back from a 15-0 deficit late in the first half. 
The previous lowest non-strike crowd was 45,737 for a Dec. 19, 1993 game with 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 The no-shows missed an exciting finish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm used to being in the shadows," Strong said. "But every now and then, I 
emerge. I don't have good 40 speed, but I have good game speed. It feels great 
to win a football game and break our losing streak." 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks (4-7) ended a six-game slide and handed the Buccaneers (2-9) 
their sixth loss in a row to clinch Tampa Bay's 12th consecutive losing season. 
</P>
<P>
 How tough was the loss? 
</P>
<P>
 A frustrated Coach Sam Wyche, in the third year of a five-year contract, 
didn't want to answer that question. He has previously said he expects to lose 
his job next season. The Buccaneers are for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have nothing to really say about the game. It was a 22-21 finish and I 
congratulate Tom Flores," Wyche said at his news conference. Then he turned 
around and walked out of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks went 77 yards in 12 plays in 2:42 to score their winning 
touchdown after Michael Husted's 35-yard field goal put Tampa Bay ahead, 21-15, 
with 3:24 to go. 
</P>
<P>
 On the 12th play of the drive, Strong, a reserve playing at tailback in place 
of the injured Chris Warren, ran seven yards around right end on second and 
six. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks didn't have timeouts left and the clock was moving. The 
Buccaneers were expecting Seattle to pass.

BUTTS COMES TO LIFE AGAINST CHARGERS; AFC: HE RUNS FOR 88 YARDS AND A TOUCHDOWN 
AGAINST HIS FORMER TEAM TO LEAD PATRIOTS, 23-17. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marion Butts shredded his former San Diego teammates, then smiled with some of 
them as he posed for a post-game photo. It was a day to remember. 
</P>
<P>
 In his best game of a disappointing season, Butts ran for a season-high 88 
yards and one touchdown in 28 carries as the New England Patriots defeated the 
Chargers, 23-17, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was real tight with a lot of guys out there," said Butts, the 
second-leading rusher in Charger history. "I was motivated against them. I 
almost felt too anxious to succeed. I had to tell myself to calm down." 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots led, 10-0, at halftime and, 23-10, before San Diego scored with 
55 seconds left on Stan Humphries' two-yard pass to Tony Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the second half, we went to a gambling defense," Charger Coach Bobby Ross 
said. "If you do that, you'll get burned. We just had huge breakdowns 
defensively. The game was definitely not as close as 23-17." 
</P>
<P>
 For Butts, it has been a tough transition. The Patriots obtained him in a 
draft-day trade to add power and consistency to their running attack. 
</P>
<P>
 But he averaged only 42 yards in his first 10 games, while Natrone Means, now 
San Diego's featured back, averaged 94.7 as the AFC's leading rusher. Means was 
held to 59 in 15 carries Sunday and has 1,006 this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been pretty hard (for me) this season," Butts said. "You have to have 
inner desire. You have to be strong. A lot of people were down on me." 
</P>
<P>
 Not Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure he feels good. It's been a long time coming for him," Patriot Coach 
Bill Parcells said. "They were tough yards, and that's a good defensive team. 
Overall, it was our best game of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers (8-3) began the day with the NFL's third-best run defense, but 
allowed 101 rushing yards, 18 more than their average. They are 2-3 since 
winning their first six games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots (5-6) won their second consecutive game, ending a four-game 
stretch against division leaders, and moved within two games of AFC East leader 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 They defeated Minnesota, 26-20, last Sunday after trailing, 20-0. Bledsoe, who 
set NFL records of 45 completions and 70 attempts in that game, was 21 of 36 
for 224 yards and one touchdown Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "People may have looked at last week's game and said, 'Oh, that's a fluke, 
they'll go back to the old form,' " Patriot linebacker Vincent Brown said. "For 
us to go out and play the way we did was a big plus." 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots, who had the NFL's worst pass defense, bothered Humphries all 
day, causing him to throw three interceptions. He was sacked five times. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been beat this physically," San Diego offensive tackle Harry 
Swayne said. "We usually are the type of team that pushes, beats and mashes 
people. What I'm worried about is now we have five games left and it's time to 
make a playoff push." 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Coleman's 80-yard kickoff return had cut the Patriots' lead to 13-10 
with 24 seconds to play in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Butts then led the Patriots on a 64-yard march that ended with his one-yard 
run, his first touchdown in seven games.

NCAA SOCCER; UCLA SHEDS PAST DEFEATS WITH VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After three years and 115 minutes, UCLA finally unburdened itself Sunday by 
defeating Alabama Birmingham, 3-2, in overtime in the first round of the NCAA 
men's soccer tournament at Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 And it all began with a little run. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio Umana darted from behind teammate Eddie Lewis and sprinted down the left 
wing into open field to receive Lewis' short pass. 
</P>
<P>
 A quick, accurate cross to the far post from Umana found the head of Robbie 
LaBelle, who sent the ball back across the goal to the dangerous left foot of 
Ante Razov. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five minutes into overtime, Razov easily directed the ball into the 
back of the goal to end UCLA's three-game losing streak and give the Bruins 
their first postseason victory since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Razov, a junior, raced from the goal, tearing off his shirt as if to strip 
away the bad memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was more than a monkey," UCLA Coach Sigi Schmid said of the losing streak. 
"It was a big, old, giant gorilla." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA had lost to San Diego in the first round of the tournament each of the 
last two seasons. This year, it looked as if the Bruins might struggle again 
after they suffered late-season injuries to three key starters and were shut 
out in their last three games. 
</P>
<P>
 But with UCLA's starters injury-free for only the third time this season, the 
Bruins were ready for the tournament. LaBelle scored UCLA's first goal in four 
games to tie the score, 1-1, in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "After we scored that first goal, it was like, we can really do this, we can 
score," LaBelle said. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA (16-4), looking stronger than Alabama Birmingham (15-4-1), dominated the 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA will play at Southern Methodist (15-3-1) in the second round this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The date and time will be announced today. SMU defeated Wisconsin in the first 
round, 2-1.

NBA ROUNDUP; SACRAMENTO GETS A LIFT FROM ROOKIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It took rookie Brian Grant exactly seven games to record his first 
double-double for the Sacramento Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant, coming off the bench, scored 18 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in 
Sacramento's 96-88 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers at Sacramento on Sunday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still a rookie and there's a lot of stuff I have to learn," said Grant, a 
first-round pick from Xavier of Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 With the game hanging in the balance, Grant scored 12 fourth-quarter points, 
including six of the last seven for the Kings. Fellow rookie Michael Smith 
scored six of his 13 points in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland 98, Detroit 96 -- Clifford Robinson scored 26 points and James 
Robinson, playing out of position at point guard, scored 24 as the Trail 
Blazers overcame a 35-point performance by Joe Dumars at Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford Robinson made two free throws with 15 seconds left to give Portland a 
96-94 lead, and he made another with 8.7 seconds left to increase the lead to 
three. 
</P>
<P>
 James Robinson started in place of Rod Strickland, who went on the injured 
list Sunday with a slight fracture of his right wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 Point guards Terry Porter and Negele Knight were already on Portland's injured 
list, and off-guard Clyde Drexler is out with a sprained right ankle.

RIVER FLYER RECOVERS FROM SLOW START; HORSE RACING: ANTLEY RIDES HIM TO 1 
3/4-LENGTH VICTORY OVER DARE AND GO IN HOLLYWOOD DERBY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Heading into the first turn of Sunday's $400,000 Hollywood Derby, River Flyer 
was caught five horses wide. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner John Mabee and trainer David Hofmans were ready to give up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared to death," Mabee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hofmans looked at River Flyer's terrible position and muttered a few salty 
phrases. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I could see was (Chris) Antley's head, and he was back in the saddle," 
Hofmans said. "I thought the race was over." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the 13-horse field approached the backstretch, Antley had guided 
River Flyer to the lead and angled him toward the rail. 
</P>
<P>
 And River Flyer still had enough left for a 1 3/4-length victory over Dare and 
Go, with Fadeyev finishing third, another half-length back at Hollywood Park. 
Tabasco Cat, the Preakness-Belmont winner who went off as a 2-1 favorite in his 
first run on grass, contended early, but finished eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 River Flyer, who ran the 1 1/8-mile race in 1:47 2/5 and paid $10 to win, was 
supposed to take the lead from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the (assistant) starters eared him down (grabbed him by the ear) in 
the gate," Mabee said. "I was upset, but then it turned out all right." 
</P>
<P>
 River Flyer, winner of four of nine starts before Sunday, including three of 
four on grass, had run in only one stake. He defeated one horse in a $50,000 
ungraded grass race at Bay Meadows at the end of his 2-year-old season. 
</P>
<P>
 But his camp was confident Sunday, having paid a $15,000 supplement to enter 
him in the race. After three months of rest at John and Betty Mabee's Golden 
Eagle Farm in Ramona this year, River Flyer returned last July at Del Mar. He 
ran four solid allowance races, including three consecutive victories and a 
wire-to-wire, 8 1/2-length victory in a 1 1/8-mile grass race at Santa Anita on 
Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mabees and Hofmans thought so much of River Flyer's improvement that they 
wished he ran in the $1-million Breeders' Cup Mile at Churchill Downs that day. 
River Flyer was pre-entered for the Mile, but he had no stakes credentials. He 
was ranked last of the 23 pre-entered horses, and only the first 14 were 
allowed to run. 
</P>
<P>
 "The winner had been telling us how good he was, but we didn't believe it," 
said trainer Richard Mandella, who turned down the chance to continue training 
River Flyer this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandella trained River Flyer as a 2-year-old, when he won one of five starts. 
But he didn't have room in his barn when the horse arrived at Del Mar this 
summer. Hofmans and Mandella both train horses for the Mabees. 
</P>
<P>
 Dare and Go, a French horse who was saddled for the first time by Mandella, 
also broke poorly Sunday and was next to last after a half-mile. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was flat-footed leaving the gate," Mandella said. "Our plan was to stalk 
the pace, but that option was taken away after the first eighth of a mile." 
</P>
<P>
 Bred by the Mabees, River Flyer is a son of Riverman and Young Flyer, a Flying 
Paster mare who earned more than $200,000 in Golden Eagle's colors. River Flyer 
earned $200,000 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Antley rode River Flyer for the first time on Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got off to a slow start and still overcame it," Antley said Sunday. "My 
horse was running comfortably all the way." 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of the stretch, Antley looked over his left shoulder and liked what 
he saw. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could see that there were no contenders," he said. "I peeked one more time 
at the 16th pole, because big mistakes have been made and I didn't want to use 
the horse any more than I had to." 
</P>
<P>
 Antley shook the whip in River Flyer's face, but never used it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, this one is genuine," Antley said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Southern Wish, claimed for $75,000 by trainer Wally Dollase from Craig Lewis 
in February, won his second stake this fall by registering a three-length 
victory over Square Cut in the $250,000 Citation Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Wish, who needed two pins in his leg to repair a fracture, didn't 
race for six months after Dollase's claim. Since then, the 5-year-old roan 
gelding has won three of four starts, including the $150,000 Pomona Handicap at 
Fairplex Park. Ridden Sunday by Corey Nakatani and carrying 115 pounds, three 
less than the high-weighted Beneficial, Southern Wish paid $7, running 1 1/4 
miles in 2:00 1/5. Southern Wish's owner, Richard Stephen, paid a $10,000 
supplemental fee to the Citation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rotsaluck, another gelding from the claiming ranks -- he ran for $32,000 last 
year in his first start -- held off Marina Park by a half-length to win the 
$150,000 Hollywood Turf Express. Rotsaluck, ridden by Fernando Valenzuela and 
trained by Vladimir Cerin, paid $6.60, running 5 1/2 furlongs on grass for his 
fourth consecutive victory. D'Hallevant finished third and Cool Air, the 8-5 
favorite, was fourth. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Bobby Frankel upset track management by scratching Torch Rouge from 
the Hollywood Derby at 9:15 a.m. Saturday. Had the scratch been made 15 minutes 
earlier, Mighty Forum would have drawn into the field from the also-eligible 
list. "I wasn't very happy about it," Hollywood Park chairman R.D. Hubbard 
said. "We called the (California Horse Racing Commission), to see if there was 
some way we could get the extra horse in. Now we're going to see if the rule 
can be changed to avoid this happening again." Torch Rouge was 20-1 on the 
morning line and had the No. 13 post, inside his 6-1 stablemate, Eagle Eyed. 
"(Scratching) gets Eagle Eyed into the No. 13 hole," Frankel said. "It would 
have been a tough go for Torch Rouge, anyway. He had a tough race at Churchill 
Downs two weeks ago and it would have been a quick turnaround." . . . Hollywood 
Wildcat has a cough and will miss Sunday's $400,000 Matriarch. . . . Alex 
Solis, his neck stiff from a spill Thursday, was sidelined for the third day. 
He's expected to return Wednesday, but will be replaced by Yukio Okabe aboard 
Yohann Quatz in Saturday's Japan Cup.

O.C. THEATER REVIEW; MOULTON'S 'CAROL' MAKES IT MERRIER CHRISTMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are very few plays that can put you in stitches and make you laugh till 
you cry. "Inspecting Carol," a backstage Christmas farce at the Moulton 
Theater, does both. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh, topical and outrageously funny, this Laguna Playhouse production will 
have you laughing out loud in the first act and wiping away the tears in the 
second. It opened over the weekend and continues through Dec. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief target of this savvy lampoon is not just those boilerplate stagings 
of "A Christmas Carol" that take over almost all our theaters at this time of 
year, but the whole fabric of pious customs entrenched in American theatrical 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Written by Daniel Sullivan and members of the nationally recognized Seattle 
Repertory Theatre (where Sullivan is artistic director), "Inspecting Carol" 
gives us a glimpse of a down-at-the-heels drama troupe that has lost half its 
subscribers and is trying to hang on to the rest with its 13th annual offering 
of the Dickens classic. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot depends on a nicely turned case of mistaken identity lifted in spirit 
from Gogol's "The Government Inspector": An amateur actor shows up out of the 
blue looking to audition for a role, any role, and wrongly is assumed to be a 
bureaucrat from the National Endowment for the Arts who has arrived incognito 
to evaluate the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Desperate to save the NEA grant, which is the only thing that stands between 
the company and financial collapse, the director tries to ingratiate herself by 
casting him in the play. Soon the rest of the troupe is fawning over him as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 For all its comic exaggeration, Sullivan's script has the ring of truth about 
the state of regional theater around the country. And this production, billed 
as a Southern California premiere, delivers the goods with a marvelous brand of 
burlesque that is hip but not sneering and absurd without being unreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Multiculturalism, political correctness and the NEA all come in for a gentle 
bashing. So do racial stereotyping, minority tokenism and the scads of abject 
grantees that depend on the NEA's goodwill. Anyone who wants to celebrate the 
season with a satirical Yuletide show instead of a dutiful one ought to rush 
right over to the Moulton. 
</P>
<P>
 The bravura staging by Andrew Barnicle takes big risks going over the top and 
never misses. The well-cast ensemble responds with thoroughbred performances 
depicting a motley collection of recognizable types that are hugely 
entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Shelton lays much of the groundwork with a sharp portrait of the company's 
unctuous business manager. John Serembe, as the crackpot star of the troupe, 
adds a high comic sheen to the sendup with his take-charge Scrooge, who has a 
predilection for last-minute, socially relevant rewrites that drive the rest of 
the cast crazy.  
</P>
<P>
 Then there are Shannon McCleerey as the deadpan stage manager, Linda Bisesti 
as the self-dramatizing director and Andy Hedden as the mistaken NEA official 
who manages to transform every role he plays (including Tiny Tim) into the evil 
hunchback from Shakespeare's "Richard III." 
</P>
<P>
 Teri Ciranna offers a strong supporting performance as the troupe's resident 
Brit who, in a bit of reverse English, affects a Brooklyn accent. Jim McElenney 
is a walking gag of rattling chains, and Kyle Jones, who looks truly dumbstruck 
playing a young actor on stage for the first time, gets some of the evening's 
biggest laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, the show is a gem; play and production seem brilliantly matched. 
The set itself gets into the act in hilarious ways that will surprise you. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inspecting Carol" is hands down the funniest show I've seen all year.

MUSIC REVIEW; ASAWA: COUNTERTENOR REVELATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The countertenor isn't exactly a new breed. Men -- real men -- often sang with 
sweet, high, possibly effeminate voices way back in the Middle Ages. 
</P>
<P>
 For most impractical and essentially myopic purposes, however, the modern 
movement began with a heroic nonconformist named Alfred Deller, who made his 
London debut in 1943. A lyric baritone with a drastically extended, carefully 
cultivated top range -- quasi-falsetto -- he started a precious trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin Britten wrote the otherworldly music of Oberon in "A Midsummer 
Night's Dream" with Deller's tone in mind. Rivals and successors soon began to 
materialize -- Russell Oberlin, James Bowman, John Ferrante, among others -- 
and opera companies began to cast them in ornate Baroque roles originally 
intended for castrati (virtuosic gentleman who, pre-puberty, had been forced to 
give their all for art). 
</P>
<P>
 Countertenors were supposed to make high, sweet, tiny, flexible sounds. No one 
expected much power, much dynamic variety or much sensuality from a vocal 
apparatus that, it could be argued, was artificially produced. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget all that. At least, forget most of it. Two newcomers on the front 
happen to be blessed with extraordinarily beautiful voices, superb techniques 
and, hardly incidentally, the sort of personalities that could stimulate star 
cults above and beyond the rarefied realm of the early-music specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 In Germany there is Jochen Kowalski. In America there is Brian Asawa. 
</P>
<P>
 Asawa, 28 and a proud product of Southern California, left an imposing calling 
card last month in Handel's "Xerxes" with the Music Center Opera. Friday night, 
he revealed more of his extraordinary gifts in an uncompromising debut recital 
at the Japan America Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Delicately accompanied by lute (Michael Eagan) and bass viol (Mark Chatfield), 
Asawa began with music of Dowland and Purcell. The tone was amazingly pure, the 
expressive scale subtle, the interpretive stance restrained yet always urgent. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, with Armen Guzelimian providing sensitive collaboration on a sometimes 
incongruous modern piano, Asawa turned to a dramatic cantata by Vivaldi, a 
gutsy aria by Handel, varied Romantic Lieder of Schubert, exquisite melodies of 
Faure, and, finally, some witty modernist miniatures by Ned Rorem. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, to be sure, a discerning menu, and Asawa served it with unflagging 
generosity, with intelligence and elegance. It would be less than realistic to 
pretend that his dynamic range matches his coloristic range (that's probably 
the nature of the laryngeal beast), and it would be less than honest to claim 
that his agenda proved notable for any striking structural climaxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The abiding goal seemed to be muted introspection. A little of that can go a 
long way in the concert hall. Still, one had to be astounded by the singer's 
ease and grace under pressure, his daring and his fastidious concern for period 
detail. (If he is the one responsible, he also deserves applause for an 
impeccable program booklet, complete with texts, translations and helpful 
though uncredited annotations.) 
</P>
<P>
 Was everything perfect? Not quite. Even Asawa seems to be reassuringly human. 
Attacks sometimes began to sag in pitch as the evening wore on. Diction was 
occasionally sacrificed on the altar of surface prettiness. Schubert's passions 
remained subdued. 
</P>
<P>
 One inadvertent slip of the singer's tongue (or was it a slip of the 
listener's ear?) produced a bit of unintentional mirth. At the end of Faure's 
"Arpege," the poet sings of "dying in the midst of your hair" -- "mourir parmi 
vos cheveux." Asawa, however, seemed to sing "mourir parmi vos chevaux " -- 
which means "dying in the midst of your horses. " It isn't quite the same 
image. 
</P>
<P>
 At encore time, Asawa allowed himself some gentle flirtation with popular 
indulgences. Everything, of course, is relative. 
</P>
<P>
 First came a coloratura aria from Mozart's much-neglected "Ascanio in Alba," 
brilliantly dispatched. This was followed by a charming -- and quite persuasive 
-- appropriation of Cherubino's "Voi che sapete," an aria Mozart specifically 
wrote for a female soprano impersonating a male adolescent. To cap the evening, 
Asawa turned to "Che faro senza Euridice" from Gluck's "Orfeo," the singer's 
delicate eloquence perfectly reflected, and summarized, by Guzelimian in the 
keyboard postlude.

JAZZ REVIEW; ROSS TOMPKINS PLAYS IN KEY OF SUAVE AT KIKUYA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Friday may have been one of the chilliest nights of the season, but that 
didn't stop Kikuya house guitarist Doug MacDonald and his trio from warming 
almost immediately to the presence of their special guest, pianist Ross 
Tompkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Tompkins and MacDonald are no strangers, having spent many nights together in 
Los Angeles as members of the Snooky Young/Bob Cooper quintet of the mid-'80s. 
Though best known as the keyboard player in Doc Severinsen's "Tonight Show" 
band, Tompkins has worked with a host of greats over the years including Kai 
Winding, Clark Terry, Al Cohn, Zoot Sims, Bobby Hackett and Louie Bellson. 
Nowadays he can be found in the L.A. clubs only rarely, when he isn't touring 
as a solo act (he has a gig this week at Duke University in North Carolina). 
</P>
<P>
 The unaccompanied segments of his performance here were the most revealing. 
His solo introduction to "My Funny Valentine" hinted at the melancholy theme 
while swirling through a variety of moods and rhythms, mostly using his right 
hand. He turned to his left hand to introduce "Am I Blue?" working in somber, 
considered style with few counterpoints. 
</P>
<P>
 Nattily dressed and imperially slim, he used these intros to set up the tunes 
without saying a word to his partners: Looking across the keyboard toward 
MacDonald, he would wind through his prefaces until the band members caught on 
and signaled with their nods. As the guitar, bass and drums joined in, Tompkins 
was turned loose to explore the melodies in sophisticated, intelligent style. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballads took center stage, and Tomkins gave each a rich, romantic treatment. 
"Emily" showed Bill Evans-esque sensitivity while "You Are Too Beautiful" was 
full of rhythmic starts and stops. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everything was delivered at a slow pace. Nat Adderley's "Work Song" 
was played with assertive strength; each break between the lines of the famous 
theme hit with hammer-like certainty. Sonny Rollins' be-bop-paced "Sonnymoon 
for Two" further let Tompkins demonstrate that his smarts don't desert him when 
the tempo goes up. 
</P>
<P>
 Tompkins' suave ways, and the crowded room, brought out the best in MacDonald 
and company. 
</P>
<P>
 The guitarist showed that he loves his work, smiling and winking at the 
audience before closing his eyes to look inward during particularly difficult 
passages. From the first tune of the evening, "Time on My Hands," the trio 
played at its peak, matching fine individual efforts with alert, savvy 
interplay. 
</P>
<P>
 Bassist Jack Prather and drummer Nick Martinis worked as a solid team when 
supporting the front line. Prather was especially inventive during his 
improvisations, sometimes alternating between bowed and plucked tones, and 
backing the sound with wordless vocal resonance. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinis displayed his characteristic responsiveness, sometimes playing on the 
beat to emphasize one of his cronies' more pointed statements, often echoing a 
particularly appropriate line from Tomkins or MacDonald with soft punctuation 
from a cymbal, or a snap at his snare. 
</P>
<P>
 The turnout was encouraging, and the assembled weren't disappointed. The 
foursome proved just the thing for the chilly night -- more romantic than an 
evening in front of the fireplace and, when things really started cooking, just 
as hot.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; TOMLINSON HAS THE VOICE IF NOT THE WORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Tomlinson's solo concert at the Coach House Saturday had the cozy feel 
of a gathering of friends in someone's living room. The sweet-toned singer and 
songwriter made everyone feel comfortable with between tune narratives and 
witty asides, and his seemingly heartfelt delivery included smiles at every 
turn. 
</P>
<P>
 To make it even more neighborly, Tomlinson, in shorts and minus his trademark 
beard, spent his entire 30-minute break between sets out in the audience 
signing autographs, having his picture taken and chatting with his fans. 
Appropriately, Tomlinson, who performs only his own songs, drew heavily from 
his current, self-produced release "At Your House." (He also offered samples of 
an upcoming album and a look at his earlier work). 
</P>
<P>
 To say the show was well-received would be an understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 His fans seem to crave the feel-good vision of his songs. His world, as 
reflected in his lyrics, is full of birdsongs, sunlight, snowflakes and winds 
blowing this way and that, not to mention love, love, love. Sure, there's the 
occasional heartbreak, too, but it is always of the deliciously melancholy 
type. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if that world view doesn't reflect yours, you can't argue with 
Tomlinson's presentation. Though his guitar playing isn't much (he makes Paul 
Simon sound like Segovia), it's just enough to support his lovely, choir-boy 
vocals. His voice is warm and, at times, sensual; his high-tenor tones are 
filled with just enough breath to bring them radiantly alive. 
</P>
<P>
 His clear enunciation and his charming way of sliding up a full octave and 
back in a single syllable are particularly attractive. In short, it's a voice 
that could melt the most frozen mood. 
</P>
<P>
 But his lyrics just aren't of the same quality. They are filled with cliches 
("like a river returning to the sea"), strange inversions ("a better lover of 
the world/I want to be") mixed metaphors and unfathomable images. Tomlinson 
succeeds only on the overall tone of his tales; give them a word-by-word 
examination and the magic starts to unravel. 
</P>
<P>
 There were moments when his poesy came close to matching the charms of his 
delivery, especially with the newer material. Take these lines from "Yellow 
Windows": 
</P>
<P>
 Gentle wind, you are an angel.  
</P>
<P>
 Oh if you were flesh and blood.  
</P>
<P>
 But that chimney smoke's your lover;  
</P>
<P>
 I have watched you making love.  
</P>
<P>
 Better yet, though, were the wordless vocal passages that opened "Sunlight" 
and "In My Dream" -- they let his vocal talents work without the encumbrance of 
words and their meanings. It's something he definitely should do more of, even 
if his lyric writing continues to shape up. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some time with the great poets -- may we suggest Yeats, Keats and 
Shelly? -- could do him a world of good. It's a shame to waste such a beautiful 
voice on such insipid material.

 Coming Attractions: Aaron Spelling fans alert: "University Hospital," a new 
Spelling program, will replace the very low-rated "Heaven Help Us" on the TV 
mogul's block of first-run syndicated shows on KCOP Channel 13. The lineup of 
first-run syndication shows, sometimes called Spelling's "mini-network," is on 
Thursdays from 8 to 10 p.m. The new show, about the lives and loves of four 
student nurses and their supervising nurse, premieres on the Spelling Premiere 
Network in mid-January. Tony-winning actress Tonya Pinkins ("Jelly's Last 
Jam"), who also starred on ABC's soap "All My Children," will play the 
supervisor. . . . Oliver Platt, Arliss Howard, Peter Riegart and Alan King have 
been cast in the upcoming HBO thriller, "In Hitler's Shadow," based on the book 
by Yaron Svoray, an Israeli journalist who infiltrated Germany's neo-Nazi 
organizations, and Nick Taylor. The telefilm will focus on Svoray's real-life 
experiences.

 'Pops' Could Go Pop: After 25 years, it may be the finale for the beloved 
"Evening at Pops" PBS TV series. Hit by scaled-back contributions from 
financially strapped sponsors, the Boston Symphony Orchestra's summertime 
concert series has to scrape up at least $1.2 million by Feb. 1 for national 
programming to continue. If the money is not raised, concerts would continue, 
including the live Fourth of July bash that draws about 350,000 people to a 
bandshell along the Charles River, but they wouldn't be seen on national TV. 
The televised broadcasts, which began in 1969, draw about 39 million viewers 
each summer.

 Rap Video Airs: Despite intense criticism by crime-victims rights 
organizations, an unedited version of the controversial video "Natural Born 
Killaz" by rap stars Dr. Dre and Ice Cube will appear on TV. The video 
premieres Tuesday on "Hard Copy" at 7 p.m. on KCBS Channel 2. In it, the 
rappers portray serial killers and poke fun at the gruesome stabbings of Nicole 
Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman, as well as the shotgun ambush of Jose 
and Kitty Menendez. During the making of the video, representatives for the 
families and the victims-rights groups called the rappers "irresponsible" and 
chastised them for "ridiculing a tragedy." RADIO

 New KLOS-FM Lineup: After firing veteran deejays Bob Coburn and Jim Benson 
last week, KLOS-FM (95.5) turned to rival rock station KNAC-FM (105.5) for 
their replacements: Long Paul and Remy Maxwell. And Randy Maranz, who has been 
doing deejay work at the station for the past year, has been given a full-time 
on-air job to replace Gino Michelini, who was dropped Oct. 24. Beginning today, 
the KLOS weekday lineup is Maranz, 10 a.m.-2 p.m.; Paul, 2-6 p.m.; and Maxwell, 
6-10 p.m. "I felt it was a necessary change if KLOS was to continue to evolve 
into a more contemporary rock station," program director Carey Curelop said.

 Hunting Dispute: Steven Seagal, the actor and martial-arts expert, reportedly 
is incensed that a man who took him elk hunting in October may have lied about 
his qualifications. Jodi Clay Hill was arrested in Hot Sulphur Springs, Colo., 
last week on charges of outfitting without a license and illegal sale of 
wildlife. Seagal says he asked Hill at least three times if he was licensed and 
Hill assured him he was, a state wildlife agent said in court papers. His 
guide's qualifications aside, Seagal, who paid $5,000 for the trip, did bag a 
bull elk. QUICK TAKES

COUNTERPUNCH LETTERS; OVERREACTING TO PAGLIA'S 'LESSON' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I can't help but think that in Tammy Bruce's response ("When It Comes to 
Harassment, Paglia Cannot Speak for Us," Nov. 14) to Camille Paglia's 
commentary on David Mamet's film "Oleanna" ("The Real Lesson of 'Oleanna,' " 
Nov. 6), she is succumbing to the very problem Paglia is trying to identify: 
oversensitivity and overreaction. Mamet's work gives us a very clear picture of 
how anyone can, through careful manipulation of words out of context, denigrate 
anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 As an educator, I have a perspective of the extent to which political 
correctness has begun to skew the learning process. To Bruce, "Oleanna's" 
antagonist is asking for it. In fact, the first half of the film presents her 
as a befuddled and overwhelmed student trying to stay afloat in a class. 
</P>
<P>
 The real issue is: Who has control of the classroom, the educator or the 
student? The answer lies not in demanding that the world change to conform to 
the narrow agenda of some feminists but that these feminists recognize when 
they are truly being subjected to harassment and address the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce has the right to say no, but not to tell anyone else what they must 
think. That is censorship -- the issue Mamet is addressing. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 In today's light, "Oleanna" is clearly reactionary. It takes the least 
sympathetic, most desperate female character and shows her caught in the 
horrific height of the political correctness movement. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Bruce's Counterpunch scares me. Bruce starts by comparing 
Paglia and Mamet to two famous alleged sexual harassers. Next, they are branded 
misogynists. Then, Paglia's a "sellout." But Bruce has just begun slinging mud. 
Paglia, Mamet and the Calendar editors are all part of an "agenda to dismiss 
and degenerate the power women achieve when taking control in their own lives 
by recognizing and stopping the actual victimization -- the harassment itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Ms. Bruce, there is no agenda. We white American men are capable of 
great evil and stupidity. We have been entrenched in a power structure of our 
own creation for hundreds of years. We would, and do, take advantage of "our 
own" as often, if not more often, than we "subjugate" the weak. Evil is evil 
and white men are no more capable of it than women or others. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce refuses to recognize that it is her words that confirm people's worst 
fears of "victim-centered feminism." Her accusations ascribe motives that most 
readers of The Times inherently know are not real. Bruce's mission is 
honorable, but her methods destroy the message.

COUNTERPUNCH: MEASURE OF FILM ISN'T HOW MUCH IT MAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT PATRICK WAGNER, Scott Patrick Wagner is a free-lance manuscript editor 
and theatrical consultant. He is also a first-degree practitioner of Reiki, 
which is a form of healing bodywork. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Film critics for The Times frequently bemoan the "lowest common denominator" 
mentality of the American motion picture industry, but The Times does a great 
deal to encourage this trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Calendar is rife with film articles that are singularly about grosses and 
box-office status, such as the Nov. 14 story, "Love at First Bite: 'Vampire' 
Tears Into Box Office." Even the blurb about the video release of "Like Water 
for Chocolate" ("Video Tip," Calendar, Aug. 22) described the film only as the 
"highest-grossing foreign-language film ever." Having been raised both in Los 
Angeles and Mexico City, I can assure you that such a nutshell description 
would cause smiles and shaking heads there over the "quaint American way" we 
have of reducing everything to dollars and cents. 
</P>
<P>
 When did this relentless reportage on box office develop broad-based appeal? 
When did box-office figures jump from Daily Variety to the Los Angeles Times? 
When did the importance of these numbers leave the realm of the industry 
workers and become substantive criteria to the public at large? 
</P>
<P>
 Our industrywide (and nationwide) obsession with grasping for the holy grail 
of "most," "widest," "biggest" and "record-breaking-est" has created a country 
of size-fixated camp followers. Saturday night movie selections are now based 
on what film "opened big," rather than what movie your best friends told you 
moved them to tears, to peals of laughter or to deep thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason, perhaps, is that there simply aren't many films moving 
anyone's best friends to anything but compromised acceptance of mediocrity. 
When the studios strive for nothing but huge/big/wide/monster record-breakers, 
there isn't the luxury to stick to anything like a clear vision or a focused 
emotional through-line. That might mean sacrificing the McDonald's tie-in, and 
that is an unacceptable marketing strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of McDonald's (or, as it was known over Retail Summer, Roc Donald's), 
what do we think we're doing to our children with our bold commitment to 
artistic compromise? "The Flintstones" didn't open as a movie, it opened as a 
retail outlet at the mall. We don't make many movies for our children these 
days that offer the pure expression of a story and an idea. We provide blatant 
manipulations; setups for one cheesy cottage industry after another, no matter 
how peripheral to the project or deleterious to its storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
 And the retail strategizing isn't the most insidious aspect of the industry's 
numbers fixation. The stories must accommodate the money monster. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Lion King" is a prime example. This story had all the ear- and 
tail-markings of a lyrical, "serious" Disney animated feature, a la "Beauty and 
the Beast." But "Aladdin" -- with its irreverent humor and pastiche style -- 
made a lot more money than "Beauty" (which only made a lot of money). Thus, 
"Lion King" had to be twisted and refashioned. A film that was already destined 
to have inherently ultra-wide appeal due to the universality of its story, had 
to be made even ultra- wider . So the wart hog got promoted. And "funny" took 
precedence over "moving." And no one I know cried at the end of what should 
have been a deeply resonant fable about "the circle of life." 
</P>
<P>
 You may think my logic is questionable: "The Lion King," after all, has done 
spectacular business, and it's coming back for even more. So if that is the 
ultimate watermark, then I am full of hooey. But no matter who insists on 
reinforcing the concept of "box-office uber alles " (and The Times must look at 
its compliance), the "bottom line" is still not the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if we are willing to settle for less than true creative expression for 
ourselves, are we willing to impose that upon our children? Shouldn't our 
commitment be to give them the best we have to offer and to offer it 
unconditionally? We are cheapened when financial projections become more 
important than telling the story. 
</P>
<P>
 We are a country locked in debt, on every level from the personal to the 
federal, and it's no coincidence that we are fixated on the dollars and cents 
of every situation. Whether the money fixation causes the debt or the other way 
around is moot. We're locked in a self-perpetuating system of "numbers 
madness." And we're passing this insanity on to the next generation. If we do 
not give them pure offerings, without manipulation, or show them that there are 
things more important than "richest-widest-biggest-loudest," we will have 
raised a generation that may have money but will be emotionally impoverished 
and ethically bankrupt.

WEEKEND REVIEWS; POP; BIKINI KILL TEETERS ON EDGE OF DISARRAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDY MASUO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Injecting punk venom into its own feminist manifesto, Bikini Kill has spent 
the last three years storming the musical underground with a vehement message 
of youthful female empowerment. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's early show on Friday night at Las Palmas Theatre teetered 
blissfully on the brink of disarray.In addition to sound-system difficulties, 
drummer Tobi Vail had been hospitalized with a condition "too complicated to 
explain," frontwoman Kathleen Hanna told the audience. Three different drummers 
filled in for Vail (including the band's male T-shirt vendor). 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna, as the bratty ingenue, took it all in stride, handling hecklers and 
devotees with aplomb as she led the band into ragged, clangorous action. 
Bopping and vamping with perky aggression, she even invited three members of 
the audience (including a member of Fizz Gig, a kindred Los Angeles band) to 
join her on vocals. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Bikini Kill's songs seethed with emotional sincerity, Hanna had her 
gratuitous moments, mugging with a caricatured cuteness that sometimes 
underscored, other times undermined the pain and outrage of her lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 The most moving songs, "Feels Blind" and "Outta Me," were the ones where she 
seemed to let go of the poses and allowed the power of the music to carry the 
moment. Some observers would like to see the band members move past their 
adolescence musically, but the band itself seems quite content with its niche.

WEEKEND REVIEWS; DANCE; FORBIDDEN PLEASURES FROM MEVLEVI TROUPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How would Catholics feel if the Mass were outlawed except as a cultural 
performance -- and then allowed only in theaters and gymnasiums rather than 
consecrated spaces? How would Jews feel if they were on public display as 
guardians of tradition, yet forbidden to worship? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the members of the Mevlevi Ensemble could tell us -- if they dared. In 
1925, Turkish Law No. 677 banned the ceremony and sect popularly known as the 
Whirling Dervishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in 1953 was a performance again authorized -- in a movie house. The great 
blind singer Kani Karaca chanted the holy verses on that occasion and, on 
Saturday, Karaca's soulful vocalism lent an extra historic as well as artistic 
dimension to a thoughtful but in some ways misleading program by the Mevlevi 
Ensemble from Turkey at the Wadsworth Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in the 13th Century by Mevlana Jalalu'ddin Rumi, the all-male Dervish 
order named after him was centered in the city of Konya. Making everyone feel a 
little closer to that faraway time and place, his 21st-generation descendant 
graciously welcomed the Wadsworth audience and helped explain the spiritual 
focus of the Sufi poetry, music and dance on the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Mass, the Whirling Dervish ceremony (or Sema) is a highly structured, 
multipart ritual that has been set to music by a number of distinguished 
composers. Less lush than some other settings, the version by Dogan Ergin heard 
Saturday sustained an urgent rhythmic pulse and sense of transparency, 
enlisting the artistry of Karaca, a small chorus, and an ensemble of two lutes, 
two woodwinds, a zither, a fiddle and drums. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing camel-colored tombstone hats, long-sleeved white jackets and long 
white skirts that flared when they turned, seven dancers progressed from 
weighty processional marches and bows to steady, flowing counter-clockwise 
whirling -- their heads tilted to one side, their arms held out and raised, 
with the right hand cupped upward and the left curved downward. 
</P>
<P>
 With some incremental shifting of position by the dancers (again in a 
counter-clockwise arc), the actual whirling passages lasted no longer than 
seven minutes at a time. However, the hypnotic richness of those passages and 
the dancers' total absorption in them, proved so complete that when they all 
suddenly stopped whirling, the absence of motion made the stage seem utterly 
emptied out, lifeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a worship, it is remembrance," said Kabir Helminski in his introduction 
to the ceremony. But if he bravely ignored Turkish law by affirming the 
religious nature of the event, Helminski also never revealed exactly what was 
being remembered. In fact, the origins of the Sema lie in the same kind of 
intolerance as the law forbidding it. 
</P>
<P>
 Didn't the whirling originate when Mevlana Jalalu'ddin Rumi could not contain 
his grief after his followers murdered the great love of his life, Shamsi 
Tabriz? Doesn't his loss and pain still inspire its use of metaphysical trance 
to achieve a sense of union with the beloved? 
</P>
<P>
 If the actual performance by the Mevlevi Ensemble on Saturday had a sumptuous 
wealth of feeling along with superb expertise, most of the talk camouflaged the 
complexities and contradictions that make the Sema profoundly contemporary on 
its deepest level of expression.

COUNTERPUNCH: 'SQUANTO' SQUANDERS OPPORTUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMIN DAVID, Amin David is a businessman who is chair of Los Amigos of Orange 
County in Anaheim. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We are grateful that a great-spirited bilingual American peacemaker is finally 
being brought to the attention of millions by the Disney film "Squanto: A 
Warrior's Tale" (" 'Squanto' an Exceptional Family Film," Calendar, Oct. 28). 
But in taking dramatic license, the movie offers a contrived condensation of 
incidents: An important part of American history is presented as an English 
period piece with little to do with Native Americans and even less, the 
Puritans. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Amigos of Orange County, a group of Latino leaders meeting weekly since 
1978, has a deep interest in the first Thanksgiving and the historical 
Tisquantum, as he was also known. As chair of Los Amigos, I would like to 
provide some background that the film omits and also tell you how the real 
history has enabled us to come together with our neighbors to commemorate that 
first Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, we invited other groups to join us in a low-key, no-money 
"remembrance Thanksgiving." The variety of Americans who responded 
enthusiastically surprised us. Locally, agreement ranges from the Cambodian 
Assn. of America to the American Jewish Committee, from Christian Victory 
Outreach to the Council on Islamic Education, from 100 Black Men of Orange 
County to the City of Lake Forest. People of good will like the idea of 
celebrating how native-born Americans sat down in friendship with newcomer 
religious refugee boat-people. 
</P>
<P>
 This inspiration is absent from the historical narrative in the screen 
creation that ignores the American Puritan voice. 
</P>
<P>
 We know about the first Thanksgiving because of a letter dated Dec. 11, 1621, 
from Edward Winslow to a friend in England. It does not mention Tisquantum, a 
Pawtuxet Indian who had spent time in England and Spain after being enslaved by 
earlier English explorers. But the life-and-death services of friendship this 
bilingual Native American rendered the perishing Puritans leaps from pages of 
"Of Plymouth Plantation" by William Bradford, successor to Gov. John Carver, 
who died in April, 1621. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Bradford, Tisquantum's interpreting brought accord with the major 
chief, Massasoit. Tisquantum (and no one else is mentioned) showed the starving 
English where to fish and how to plant corn with fish to add nutrients to poor 
soil. It is hard to believe that there could have been a first Thanksgiving 
without him. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradford calls Tisquantum "a special instrument sent by God." When he died, 
fevered and bleeding profusely, just a year and half after first coming to the 
Puritans, he left "sundry of his things to sundry of his English friends as 
remembrances of his love; of whom they had a great loss." This moving death 
didn't fit the formula chosen for "Squanto," the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 As must always be the case with historical figures, there is much more to a 
life than cinema chooses to use. We believe this story goes to the heart of 
what America is all about. We should remember Tisquantum in our Thanksgiving 
when we sit down "so we might after a more special manner rejoice together" (in 
the words of Edward Winslow). 
</P>
<P>
 Los Amigos of Orange County has special reason for choosing Tisquantum as a 
role model. Our motto is Nos gusta ayudar (We like to help).

MUSIC REVIEWS; KRONOS QUARTET CONVEYS EMOTION OF SCHNITTKE WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Alfred Schnittke turns 60 this week, he will have spent 55 years of his 
life as a Soviet citizen, 41 of them as a musician in that defunct system. Yet, 
if one feels awkward in calling him a Russian composer, he certainly cannot be 
classified as anything else.And his music seems to prove this. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing its second of three Southern California concerts over the weekend, the 
Kronos Quartet brought together Schnittke's four string quartets in Schoenberg 
Hall at UCLA Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 These works, written in 1966, 1980, 1983 and 1989, respectively, are in a 
Shostakovichian tradition, to be sure, but also follow models by earlier 
Russians in their often morose, utterly sincere rhetoric. Each seems to have 
its own unique Schnittkean character, yet family resemblances abound. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to waffle: In the Kronos members' musical perspective and technical 
accomplishment, these performances achieved a definitive plateau. Emotionally 
engrossing, colorfully varied, thoughtfully paced and deeply probed, these 
readings explored the composer's world comprehensively and in myriad details. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Kronos -- violinists David Harrington and John Sherba, violist Hank 
Dutt and cellist Joan Jeanrenaud -- has analyzed, dissected, dug into and 
conquered all this music, the listener had but to receive the aural pictures 
here encoded: deep sadness in a sigh of resignation, thwarted fury, an 
hysterical, desperate ride across the steppes, extended cries of pain, bitter 
ironies, folkloric reminiscences, hymns of survival. In all, a generous, 
gripping evening that even seemed short. DANIEL CARIAGA

STREET SMART / HENRY CHU: CITY STORES ARE A SIGN OF THE TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU

<TEXT>
<P>
 One city's trash is another person's treasure. 
</P>
<P>
 At least, that's what the Los Angeles City Council hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a move to make a few bucks for the city's empty coffers and even inspire 
some civic pride, officials are scrounging around warehouses and scrap heaps to 
find bits and pieces of municipal history to sell, most of it right off our 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Need an old parking meter in the driveway to discourage those unwanted guests? 
How about a beat-up "Sunset Boulevard" sign to add to the children's pictures 
hanging in the hall? Or a handful of dusty pavement markers to show the way to 
the bathroom? 
</P>
<P>
 Such items will probably be available for purchase by next year at a city 
store to be set up Downtown in the Los Angeles Mall. With it, the City of 
Angels will discover what thousands of us already know to be a tried-and-true 
method of drumming up a little spare change: hold a garage sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the store hit City Council aide Morrie Goldman when he and a 
co-worker went south to attend a Dodgers-Padres game and saw San Diego's city 
store. The store carried other municipal refuse, like old fire hoses, but made 
the biggest splash by turning mundane driving and parking instructions into hip 
home decor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We said, 'Why the hell doesn't Los Angeles have this?' " said Goldman, chief 
legislative deputy to Councilman Mike Hernandez, who proposed the program last 
spring. "This is the second-largest city in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Los Angeles' size, and its presumably large cache of junk that could 
make for hot novelty items -- especially from Hollywood -- the city is a 
Johnny-come-lately to the world of municipal merchandising. 
</P>
<P>
 West Covina opened a store, dubbed City Haul, last year, and now boasts a gift 
catalogue that it mails to out-of-state customers. (A Mexico City restaurateur 
just bought 10 vintage fire hydrants for $1,000 apiece.) 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale went on the market with salvaged goods earlier this month. Lakewood 
christened a store last week. Residents of Long Beach will get a shot at owning 
city property starting this Friday, and Culver City plans to set up shop during 
the holiday rush. Even the hamlet of Hemet is in business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to solve all our budget (problems), but it's one tool in our 
bag," said Tom Marston of the Glendale city manager's office. "The positive 
thing is that it's not a tax increase." 
</P>
<P>
 For the new entrepreneurs, the stores are a double source of income: from the 
proceeds of the sales themselves and the city's share of the sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials lick their chops at the prospect of turning a profit like the one in 
San Diego, where the original store in City Hall was so successful that it 
spawned three outlets in local malls. Since 1991, the shops have pulled in more 
than $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most popular items have been various types of street signs," said San 
Diego Deputy City Manager Bruce Herring. "We have No Parking signs, a sign that 
says Swimsuit Optional, signs that say No Shooting Within City Limits.  
</P>
<P>
 "A store employee goes through the dump outside the city sign shop every 
Monday morning and takes them down to the store." 
</P>
<P>
 It can be a dirty enterprise in more ways than one. Like any spring-cleaning, 
scavenging for city goods sometimes produces skeletons in the closet, markers 
of a not-so-pretty past. 
</P>
<P>
 "There might be signs," Marston said, choosing his words carefully, "that say 
people of a certain race or a certain ethnicity can't use a certain park" or 
other public facility. "While that is certainly history, we prefer it to remain 
history, although it might be salable." 
</P>
<P>
 The signs that pass muster for Glendale's City Shoppe are inoffensive, 
sometimes amusing and not too cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the "No Spitting" warning that invokes a 1907 city ordinance ($19.95). 
A speed limit posting goes for $24.95. Shoppers can also shell out $195 for an 
old but never-used Glendale city limits sign crafted back when the population 
was 185,678 -- about 5,000 more than at last count. 
</P>
<P>
 Randi and Ken Byers of Valencia recently eyed a refurbished parking meter, 
painted blood-red and adorned with a $225 price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 "Set it outside," Randi Byers whispered to her husband. "That way you'd never 
get a ticket again." 
</P>
<P>
 When Los Angeles opens its doors for business, it should have a ready supply 
of retired signs that would fetch far less money in the scrap-metal market. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 700,000 street signs throughout the city, 10% -- or 70,000 -- must be 
replaced every year, said David Royer of the Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are too worn to survive any more exposure. Others are pilfered or 
defaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Most prone to theft and vandalism are the city's 41,000 stop signs, which are 
within easier reach of taggers and purloiners than placards posted higher up. 
Also popular with thieves are signs bearing women's names, more likely stolen 
by lovesick sweethearts than the women themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 A sense of history appeals to some. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, after the City Council renamed a portion of Sunset Boulevard and 
all of Brooklyn Avenue for the late Cesar Chavez, the Sunset and Brooklyn 
street signs in the area quickly started to disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as they knew we were going to take them down, people came out and got 
to them before we did," Royer says. 
</P>
<P>
 Most street signs in Los Angeles are no older than today's teen-agers, but a 
few date as far back as the 1920s. In the industrial parts of East Los Angeles, 
Royer says, many of the signs have been around since World War II, manufactured 
out of a durable porcelain that city sign-makers reverted to a decade ago 
because the old markers have lasted so well. 
</P>
<P>
 But before you go out and buy a street sign, Royer has one warning: They're 
bigger than you think. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they look relatively small from your vantage point behind the wheel, 
a standard street sign is 10 inches high and three feet long. Parking signs can 
be larger than newborn babies. Speed-limit placards are big enough to do any 
picket-waving protester proud. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it's eight feet up on a post, it looks small. But when you're holding 
the sign in your hand," Royer said, "it's huge." 
</P>
<P>
 Now if only the profits follow suit.

TORRES NOW ON OUTSIDE LOOKING IN; ELECTION: AFTER LOSING THE RACE FOR INSURANCE 
COMMISSIONER, THE STATE SENATOR FROM THE EASTSIDE SAYS HE MUST FIND A JOB. BUT 
HE DOES NOT RULE OUT ANOTHER RUN FOR OFFICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 State Sen. Art Torres, a week after losing his bid for state insurance 
commissioner, sits at his desk and sifts through mail from constituents, as he 
has done thousands of times during two decades in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's one from Yorba Linda, California," says Torres, distinguished-looking 
with his graying hair and blue suit. " 'Don't stop thinking about tomorrow. 
Please don't give up the cause. . . . Things can change.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Torres has spent a lot of time thinking about tomorrow since Nov. 8, the day 
he lost his bid to become California's second elected insurance commissioner 
and its first Latino in statewide office since 1876. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawmaker with solid accomplishments and a reputation as a skilled orator and 
tireless worker, Torres gave up his Senate seat to run. He must clear out of 
his offices by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres, at 47 still young for a politician, has ruled out a return to the 
Legislature -- "It's time to move on." But he has not closed the door on higher 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the senator said, he needs a job to pay the bills, including 
the expense of supporting two children, one of them in college. He is 
considering several offers but gives no details. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres vows to press ahead as a private citizen with his long-held goal of 
empowering Latinos and the politically weak. That could range from mentoring 
prospective leaders at college campuses to encouraging minority entrepreneurs.  
</P>
<P>
 He said the simple act of voting needs work. He was particularly disappointed 
that more Latinos did not turn out on Nov. 8. "Forty-five percent of the Latino 
voters had no clue as to what was at stake, and they stayed home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres said he will make his base in the East Los Angeles area, which he has 
represented in the Assembly and the Senate since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may not be in political office, but that doesn't stop me from going out and 
talking to young folks," said Torres, whose former aides include Los Angeles 
County Supervisor Gloria Molina and Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles). "If I 
can just have an impact on one person, I will be doing a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 The senator held to that kind of chin-up attitude during a two-hour interview 
in his Los Angeles office. But it was clear he was shaken by his loss to 
Assemblyman Charles W. Quackenbush (R-San Jose), whose campaign was heavily 
financed by the insurance industry, and by the passage of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres said the two were linked. The Republican wave surely cost him votes. In 
addition, Quackenbush easily outspent him with about $1.9 million in 
contributions from the insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But Torres said he can't help thinking that the anti-illegal immigrant fervor 
surrounding Proposition 187 brought many supporters to the polls who also cast 
votes against a "Torres." 
</P>
<P>
 As evidence, he cites voting results in some rural counties, such as Fresno 
County, where Proposition 187 won by a bigger percentage than it did statewide. 
Torres' margin of loss in those counties also was higher than statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 He theorizes that Proposition 187 was a ploy to get out the conservative vote 
for Gov. Pete Wilson.  
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to go after those lightning rods that will ignite conservative 
voters across the state," Torres said. "What you had here was an initiative 
that was folly, but that didn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was the second straight defeat for Torres, who ran unsuccessfully for 
the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 But pundits say Torres, once considered a top contender to be California's 
first Latino governor in this century, still has a future in politics. 
</P>
<P>
 There is his relatively close finish, 5% behind Quackenbush. And the fact that 
he was caught in the Republican wave and the Proposition 187 landslide also 
argues against long-term damage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is Torres' solid legislative record. His accomplishments include a 
Medi-Cal reform bill that allows seniors to receive care at home and a bill 
that he claims has kept thousands of children from dropping out of school. He 
has a strong environmental record and a long history of championing Latino 
causes. Torres was one of the leaders in the successful effort to keep a prison 
out of East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think his political career is over, if that's what he wants to do," 
said political science professor Larry Berg at USC. "He's a very viable 
candidate. He has a lot of assets." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres, the son of a butcher, worked after graduation as a lobbyist for an 
organization that pushed legislation to aid the state's rural poor. 
</P>
<P>
 The young lobbyist soon caught the eye of Cesar Chavez, leader of the United 
Farm Workers Union. Chavez urged Torres to run for the Assembly seat of a 
Latino legislator who had voted against the union on a key measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres lost that 1972 election and was hired by the UFW as a lobbyist. Torres 
ran for the Assembly again in 1974 and won the seat he would hold for eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 While he clearly pursued a liberal agenda, which included Latino causes, he 
sent a strong message in 1980 that he wasn't going to be anyone's sure vote. 
</P>
<P>
 In a battle over the Assembly speakership, Torres cast his vote for Willie 
Brown (D-San Francisco), while Chavez backed then-Assemblyman Howard L. Berman. 
Torres' vote infuriated Chavez, who had provided more than $100,000 in union 
funds to support Berman's bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres said he voted for Brown because Brown was more likely to end party 
bickering that had slowed legislative business. Detractors said he was currying 
favor with an eye toward higher office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not an easy decision," Torres said of his vote that shattered his 
personal, but not philosophical, relationship with Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres tweaked the noses of the Senate Democratic leadership in 1982 when he 
entered the primary as a young maverick legislator and defeated incumbent Alex 
Garcia. The win was sweet because Garcia had defeated the young Torres when he 
first sought public office in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres' political career shone brightly until 1987, when he was arrested on 
suspicion of drunk driving, after nearly crashing his car into a parked police 
vehicle in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawmaker pleaded no contest, paid a fine and was placed on probation. But 
he was arrested again on suspicion of drunk driving in 1989 after leaving a 
Sacramento restaurant. Torres said he was an alcoholic and completed a 
treatment program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The political damage didn't keep Torres from winning a third Senate term in 
1990. But losing to onetime aide Molina in the 1991 supervisor's race was 
another setback. Running with the support of labor, law enforcement and even 
the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn., Torres lost by 11 percentage points to 
then-Los Angeles City Councilwoman Molina, who ran as a reformer. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after the loss to Quackenbush, Torres will soon be the outsider. But like 
the pundits, Torres doesn't discount a return to the political arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anybody thinks I've given up, my God, I've had other obstacles that have 
stopped me temporarily," Torres said. "I have too much energy inside to 
retire."

TURMOIL IN POLICE UNION JEOPARDIZES CLOUT; CITY HALL: SHIFTS IN MEMBERSHIP 
THROW LEADERSHIP INTO UPHEAVAL THAT COULD WEAKEN THE LEAGUE'S POWER. THE 
CHANGES HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR RIORDAN AS WELL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The union that represents Los Angeles police officers is caught in a 
generational change that has left its leadership in turmoil and its political 
influence in doubt, according to City Hall observers and current and former 
members of the league board. 
</P>
<P>
 League leaders compare the mood of their electorate -- about 7,500 Los Angeles 
police officers up to the rank of lieutenant -- to that of the nation as a 
whole: surly, dissatisfied and eager for change. Compounding that, they say, is 
a generational and demographic shift at the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Younger officers, many of them women and minorities, are filling the ranks, 
and they tend to bring a different view than do their seniors to the union's 
role -- seeing it more as an instrument to express their grievances than as a 
tool to woo the city's power structure. The league's pale complexion -- no 
women or blacks have ever served on the board -- also has made it more 
difficult for union leaders to claim to fully represent the rank and file of 
the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, seven of the nine directors of the Los Angeles Police 
Protective League have been replaced, and at least one of the two surviving 
directors privately has told associates he may not seek reelection when his 
term expires. Results of the latest league elections were released last week 
and showed two incumbents -- Ron Aguilar, who runs the league's popular 
newspaper, and Fred Tredy, the board's senior member -- going down to defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, one board president was ousted last year, and his successor is 
preparing to step down after a bruising year. The battle to succeed him 
promises to be another divisive one for the league, as it pits two board 
members against one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's taken a toll on me, physically and mentally," outgoing league President 
Danny L. Staggs said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 As the league struggles through its most profound transformation since the 
late 1970s, some political observers are watching with interest and concern. 
The union has wielded powerful influence in some recent city elections, but its 
changing leadership may take it in new and difficult-to-predict directions. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the protective league backed businessman Richard Riordan for mayor 
over City Councilman Michael Woo. Its endorsement helped Riordan downplay 
revelations of his past arrest record that surfaced during the campaign's 
closing weeks. Once elected, Riordan appointed then-league President William C. 
Violante as his deputy mayor for public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 But the league's new leadership is souring on the mayor and has threatened to 
withhold its endorsement in 1997 if, as expected, Riordan backs the candidacy 
of Barbara Yaroslavsky for a City Council seat. League leaders have feuded for 
years with Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky and say they believe that his wife would 
continue his approach to police issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan has indicated that he intends to back Barbara Yaroslavsky's candidacy, 
but the union's threat to withdraw its support complicates the mayor's 
political calculus considerably. The centerpiece of Riordan's 1993 campaign and 
of his Administration has been his pledge to expand and improve the LAPD. 
Police opposition to his reelection would cloud his ability to claim credit for 
Police Department improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's just what union leaders say to expect if Riordan supports 
Yaroslavsky -- the membership, they say, would insist on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Mayor Riordan endorses Barbara Yaroslavsky, I believe we'll see a 
tremendous backlash from the rank and file," Staggs said. "I think police 
officers will see that as a sellout, and it might cause us not to endorse 
Riordan. . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 That threat rankles some at City Hall, where the league's bluster has 
sometimes cost it allies. During the recent contract talks, City Hall sources 
say, the union sent conflicting signals as it battled to cut a deal and still 
hold onto its increasingly restive membership. 
</P>
<P>
 Although league leaders ultimately won grudging approval for a contract, the 
first proposal that they negotiated with the city was roundly rejected by an 
angry rank and file, signaling to City Council leaders that the union board 
could not be counted on to sell a deal to its own membership. The league also 
bounced between tactics: First the union erected a controversial billboard 
warning that Los Angeles was an unsafe place to live; then, under fire, league 
leaders quickly removed the billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 The divisive debate, meanwhile, saw the union virulently denounce the same 
city leaders with whom they were negotiating, a tactic that strained the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "They sent out conflicting signals," one City Council source said. "They say 
they want to work with the council, but then they bash the council. They say 
they have a deal, but then they can't deliver their membership. That weakened 
their influence." 
</P>
<P>
 So has the rapid turnover in the past year, observers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we keep changing directors all the time, we can't be effective," said 
Dennis Zine, who was elected to the board this year. "The people over in City 
Hall say: 'We don't need to pay attention to them. They'll be gone tomorrow.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Behind much of the turbulence at the union is the changing face of the LAPD, 
as younger, more educated officers are hired and older officers, many of whom 
came from military backgrounds, retire or leave. Department observers say many 
younger officers bring a different approach to the job and demand a different 
role for their union. 
</P>
<P>
 Less inclined to accept the old guard's deference to authority, many of the 
younger officers often have been more willing to challenge department and city 
leadership. Last summer, the league was barred by court order from organizing a 
series of mass sick days known as the "blue flu." 
</P>
<P>
 But nonleague leaders went ahead anyway, secretly organizing the event and 
distributing news about it through anonymous posters and faxes. More than half 
the LAPD ranks called in sick on the shifts that the renegade group asked them 
boycott. 
</P>
<P>
 The league has attempted to reach out to younger members. Many attribute its 
tough rhetoric during the contract talks to the union's recognition that it was 
losing touch with more militant elements in the ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 But the gender and ethnic composition of the league board often has stifled 
its claims to represent the breadth of the new LAPD. Most striking is that no 
black officer has ever held a seat on the league board despite the LAPD's 
increasing ethnic diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 That absence left the league vulnerable to criticism earlier this year when it 
launched a campaign against then-Assistant Chief Bernard Parks, who is black. 
Parks suggested that the predominantly white league board was failing to speak 
for its black constituents, an argument echoed by the president of the largest 
African American officers association. 
</P>
<P>
 The frictions that are increasingly dividing the league leadership are in many 
ways symbolized by the struggle shaping up over the soon-to-be vacant 
presidency. Staggs represents the old school: A fixture at City Hall, he is 
practiced in the art of politics, and he won the league presidency based 
largely on his promise to work the corridors of power to secure officers a new 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 But Staggs is seen as an insider by many officers, and the younger breed of 
LAPD cop seems to favor a different approach. Their more combative style is 
reflected in one of those clamoring to succeed Staggs, Officer Bill Harkness. 
His nickname, "In-Your-Face Harkness," speaks volumes about his approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talking with Harkness is like being in an interview with a vampire," one 
acquaintance said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his effort to become league president, Harkness has divided the union 
board. Eager to avoid the public spectacle of another contentious election, 
many directors wanted to choose their new president from within the board.  
</P>
<P>
 But Harkness insisted on letting the entire rank and file cast ballots, 
irritating some others on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I made some people angry today," Harkness said Thursday after the 
league's board meeting. "I'm very set in my ways about sending this to the 
members for a vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Harkness will run against fellow board member Cliff Ruff, a longtime, 
conservative league director. An effort by yet another faction of the board to 
push the compromise candidacy of Gary Fullerton, a soft-spoken and well-liked 
officer elected to the board earlier this year, fell short when Harkness 
refused to back down. 
</P>
<P>
 That threw the issue back to the membership at large. 
</P>
<P>
 Staggs and other at the league say the succession battle already has been 
grueling and has badly split the fractured league board. And it has barely 
begun. Ballots go out next week, and the results won't be known until December. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Staggs, at least, the end is in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these directors are coming to me and saying: 'Help us,' " Staggs said. "I 
say: 'They created this problem. Let them deal with it.' "

 Originally part of the lands of the nearby San Fernando Mission, the cemetery 
lost its church affiliation more than 150 years ago. It was passed from owner

West. Records indicate that burials continued until 1939. The 750 graves 
include Native Americans, Civil War veterans, children who died in the 1918 
worldwide influenza epidemic and victims of the 1928 St. Francis Dam disaster.

</P>
<P>
 * 9263 Valley Blvd., Rosemead 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Civil War, many Southern families settled in El Monte, then called 
Lexington. Next door, on slightly higher ground, stood the community of 
Savannah. The elevated land made it the choice as the burial site for residents 
of swampy Lexington. The first known burial was in 1846, five years before most 
of the settlers arrived. Today the privately owned 5 1/2-acre cemetery, with 
200 plots remaining of its original 3,000, is run by the El Monte Cemetery 
Assn. In the 1920s, when the city began to widen Valley Boulevard, construction 
crews unearthed dozens of corpses outside the cemetery fence. Most of the 
skeletons were reburied in a mass grave inside the cemetery, but some had 
deteriorated so much that workers left them untouched and simply paved over 
them.

 3. SIERRA MADRE CEMETERY 
</P>
<P>
 * 553 Sierra Madre Blvd., Sierra Madre 
</P>
<P>
 Atop a choice hillside is a cemetery where 12 of Sierra Madre's 17 original 
settlers are buried. It was founded in 1884 on the death of Civil War veteran 
and pioneer John Richardson. The headstones of Confederate soldiers buried here 
have all been stolen by souvenir hunters or pranksters. All the burial plots at 
this privately owned 2.3-acre cemetery are filled, and only two granite niches 
in its mausoleum remain empty.

<P>
 4. FAIRMOUNT CEMETERY 
</P>
<P>
 * 301 N. Baldy Vista Ave., Glendora 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by a commercial nursery is a tiny, 119-year-old cemetery, begun 
when settler James Carson Preston donated the two-acre parcel -- a former 
Native American burial site -- as a public graveyard. The need arose in 1875 
after a German immigrant and woodcutter named Nelson was killed protecting his 
wood from a thief. Almost 200 other settlers, including potato king J.B. 
Beardslee, followed Nelson to this graveyard, most under more peaceful 
circumstances. The Fairmount Cemetery trustees give several tours a year. (818) 
335-4440.

 5. SPADRA CEMETERY 
</P>
<P>
 * 2882 Pomona Blvd., Pomona 
</P>
<P>
 Sandwiched between D.H. Trucking Co., railroad tracks and the Orange Freeway 
sits a 2 1/2-acre cemetery dating to 1868. Rancher Louis Phillips donated the 
land as a civic graveyard. Early settlers named the community Spadra after 
their hometown of Spadra Bluff, Ark. In 1971, four years after the last burial, 
the graveyard was deeded to the Historical Society of Pomona Valley. The 
cemetery, lined with pepper trees, includes 200 graves. Tours: (909) 623-2198.

 In the early 1850s, William Workman, who would become one of the founders of 
Los Angeles' first banking house, set aside an acre of land on his vast rancho 
for a family cemetery. In 1854, his brother, David, was killed during a cattle 
drive and became the first family member buried there. In 1917, more than 40 
years after the family's bank failed, bankrupting Workman, his grandson, Walter 
P. Temple Sr., acquired the homestead, having recouped the family fortunes in 
real estate and oil investments. He had a Greek Revival-style mausoleum built 
at the entrance to the cemetery, where many members of the family and friends 
were interred. Also buried here are California's last Mexican governor, Pio 
Pico, and his wife, Ygnacia. They were originally in another cemetery that the 
city dismantled in the 1920s. Workman and Pico had been great friends, so the 
Picos' descendants asked that the couple be moved to the mausoleum. The 
cemetery is preserved at the six-acre Workman and Temple Homestead, acquired in 
1981 by the City of Industry and restored as a cultural landmark. Tours: (818) 
968-8492.

 Just before the turn of the century, a colony of German Baptists known as 
Dunkers settled in the area to farm. In 1972, as industry began to move in, the 
Dunkers moved to Modesto, leaving behind their church and weed-filled 
graveyard. The Bible Missionary Church, with about 50 members, owns and 
maintains the cemetery where about 150 pioneering Dunkers and others are 
buried.

 The picturesque 26.5-acre cemetery at Pico Boulevard and 14th Street served as 
the burial ground for the family of Juan Carrillo, an early Santa Monica mayor, 
from 1876 until the family donated the land to Santa Monica in 1898. (310)

LAMP ON FILM SET STARTS $220,000 FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A high-powered lamp that fell over during the filming of a movie in a house 
near Hancock Park on Sunday touched off a fire that caused about $220,000 in 
damage, the Los Angeles City Fire Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Actors and crew were filming downstairs when the blaze broke out in a back 
room on the second floor of the house on the 1200 block of South Windsor 
Boulevard, fire spokesman Brian Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four film crew members who complained of smoke inhalation were examined at the 
scene and required no further treatment. Structural damage was estimated at 
$20,000. The rest of the toll included furnishings and filming equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphrey did not know the name of the production.

CHATSWORTH SAVORS MIDNIGHT MADNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Children fell asleep in parents' arms, Saturday night turned into Sunday 
morning, but the Chatsworth High girls' volleyball team kept playing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chancellors, facing top-seeded Palisades for the City Section 4-A Division 
title at Occidental College, broke open a tight final game just after midnight. 
 
</P>
<P>
 With Chatsworth ahead, 8-7, senior Jennifer Joseph served six consecutive 
points to help boost second-seeded Chatsworth past the four-time defending 
champion Dolphins, 10-15, 16-14, 9-15, 15-11, 15-9 in a match that ended at 
12:10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've played this late before, but only with my club team," Chatsworth middle 
blocker Jennifer Hodges said. "But the night seemed to take forever." 
</P>
<P>
 The match was delayed for more than two hours, in part because the 
Sylmar-Franklin 3-A title match (won by Sylmar in five games) lasted more than 
2 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 City Commissioner Barbara Fiege said Sunday she believed this was the first 
time the City 3-A and 4-A volleyball title matches had gone five games and the 
first time a City final in any sport had ended past midnight.  
</P>
<P>
 Franklin didn't arrive at Occidental until 6 p.m., 45 minutes before the match 
was supposed to begin and 30 minutes after Palisades arrived for the 4-A match. 
City Section officials gave both teams extra time to warm up, causing a 
20-minute delay. 
</P>
<P>
 During the final game of the 3-A match, Palisades (14-2) and Chatsworth (12-4) 
began their warm-ups in an adjacent gym to save time. "We were really getting 
pumped up watching the 3-A, their fans were making so much noise," Palisades 
outside hitter Courtney Kohl said. "We were fired up full of adrenaline, but it 
just kind of died later on." 
</P>
<P>
 The teams didn't step foot on the main-gym court until almost 10 p.m. "We were 
getting really antsy," Hodges said. "We figured we probably wouldn't start at 8 
p.m. like we were supposed to, but the other match kept dragging on and we 
waited and waited." 
</P>
<P>
 Supported by 400 fans (about 100 left before the end of the match), Chatsworth 
rallied from a 2-1 game deficit behind Joseph and Hodges. Joseph had 19 kills 
and Hodges had her third outstanding blocking game in a row, finishing with 11 
blocks and 11 kills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really felt the support of the crowd and all the noise they made," Hodges 
said. "We also had Debbie Smith on our bench encouraging us and helping us the 
whole match." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was a starter for the Chancellors until a knee injury early in the third 
game of the year ended her season. Smith served as a student assistant for the 
final. 
</P>
<P>
 Palisades defeated Chatsworth in four games in a preseason match. "When we 
played (Chatsworth) early in the year, they seemed disorganized since they had 
so many players," Kohl said. "It was much easier then." 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth advances to the Division I State tournament and will open against 
visiting Mira Costa (28-2) at 7 p.m. Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor, the top-ranked team in the State, is seeded No. 1 for the 
Southern California region of the Division I championships.

 Saddleback will have its hands full this season after finishing eighth in the 
Sea View League last season. Experience, however, will be on the Roadrunners' 
side with a team of juniors and seniors and four returning starters. Wiora, a 
two-time, second-team All-Sea View League selection, and Diaz, a Sea-View 
League honorable mention selection, figure to be the offensive leaders. Wiora 
averaged 12.5 points and Diaz averaged seven. The Roadrunners will have to rely 
on their speed and experience to compensate for their lack of team height. "I'm 
not sure if we got much of a break moving to this new league," Anderson said. 
"This is a very tough, even-matched league." Saddleback's goal is to finish in 
the top half of the league and to possibly make the playoffs. It will depend on 
throwing the opponent's game plan off track with a quick, swarming defense. 
Another problem for the Roadrunners is that many of Saddleback's players don't 
play year round. Anderson is looking for her top newcomers, Macgasi, Rodriguez 
and Taylor, to be factors.

 "Our goal is to finish in the top three in league and make the playoffs," said 
Dukas. The fourth-year coach is looking for a strong season from his two 
returning starters, Gil (7.7 point average) and Holmes (9.9). "We have one of 
the best point guard-center combinations in the county. We are looking for them 
to score a lot, both inside and outside," Dukas said. Both will have to play up 
to their coach's expectations if the Saints are to reach the playoffs. The 
Saints also have experience on their side and with that, they will be able to 
show a number of different looks. Dukas also believes the team benefited from 
playing in the Sunset League: "Our kids learned a lot from playing in that 
tough league. Last year, there were six teams that made the top 10 in Orange 
County at one point or another during the season. That experience will make us 
that much better this season." Dukas is also counting on his other three 
returning lettermen, Cecy Ramirez, Castro and Nuth, to be imposing threats in 
the new league. "If we get off to a strong start, anything is possible," Dukas 
said.

 Falk believes his team's strengths are experience and leadership. Scheuerman 
(14-point average last season) and Carr, both All-Sea View League selections 
last season, will be asked to provide both. The Tillers have six returning 
letter winners who have playoff experience. Falk believes that if sophomore 
point guard Simoes has a fast start, she could have the tools to become a 
Division I college point guard, something about which the Tillers know quite a 
lot. Class of '91 point guard Wanda Sequeira plays the point at San Francisco 
and Sarah Davis, class of '94, is at Long Beach State. One thing that might 
hurt the Tillers is a late start. Six of their 10 players, including four 
starters, play for the school's volleyball team, which reached the Southern 
Section Division IV quarterfinals before bowing out. This season, the Tillers 
will rely on size and strength to get back to postseason play, something 
they've done every season since 1974.

 Thoughts of tournament championships, 20 victories, a league title and a 
Southern Section championship are on the minds of Ocean View players and 
coaches. The Seahawks won the Sunset League title last year but lost to 
Woodbridge in the Division II-AA semifinals, 49-38. Strengths for the Seahawks 
will be shooting, defense and ballhandling. Martin is looking for leadership 
from his returning all-league players, Jennifer Tuiolosega and Fraser. 
Tuiolosega was a second-team selection who avearaged 10.3 points. She was 
selected to the La Quinta and Marina all-tournament teams as a freshman. 
Fraser, also a La Quinta all-tournament selection, averaged 9.5 points and is a 
constant threat from three-point range. The Seahawks are very young, very 
athletic and should be an excellent defensive squad with explosive offense. 
Martin was also pleased with the summer play of Leimbke, who has an outstanding 
shot, is an excellent rebounder and should prove a strong force in the pivot. 
Another freshman surprise is Hill. Martin says she is an excellent driver to 
the basket and a good rebounder. The Seahawks should remain among the top teams 
in the county and are favored to be the league's first champions.

ART REVIEW; RETROSPECTIVE EXAMINES A PHOTOJOURNALIST'S ART; PHOTOGRAPHY: ANNIE 
LEIBOVITZ'S PICTURES STRIP AWAY THE PERSONAS OF MEDIA CELEBRITIES WITH WIT AND 
AFFECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Annie Leibovitz's first real photo assignment was a picture of John Lennon for 
the cover of Rolling Stone. It was 1970, she was 21 and still a student. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade later, the former Beatle was the subject of her most memorable image 
-- that vaguely shocking icon where he straddles Yoko Ono in fetal nudity was 
taken on Dec. 8, 1980. A few hours later, he was shot to death by a unhinged 
admirer. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Leibovitz is 45 and about as well-known as many of her subjects. She has 
won a heap of awards as a photojournalist. She's the object of a full-scale 
international traveling retrospective just opened at the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art titled "Annie Leibovitz, Photographs 1970-1990." 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways the Lennon portrait with its pathetic childlike exhibitionism is 
the artist's leitmotif. Her pictures provide a study of 20 years when the world 
became addicted to celebrity. Consumers of media made its actors into presences 
more vivid than family or friends. The actors came to feel that mere fame was 
not enough. They had to transform themselves into that peculiar entity called a 
"celebrity" -- someone more renown for being constantly on public view than for 
whatever it is they do. In order to be real in this milieu, one must be 
transformed into an illusion. Leibovitz helps foster those illusions with an 
unusual mixture of wit and affection.

 In the '60s, being famous was something fun. Andy Warhol promised we'd all 
experience it for 15 minutes. Leibovitz's photographs of him remind us that his 
most dramatic moment of media fame came June 3, 1968, when he was shot by a 
former admirer. The hoopla would have lasted longer but the media were 
distracted by the assassination of Robert Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 By now the celebrity cult has grown into a kind of monstrosity that rivets the 
world's attention on a former football player and television huckster accused 
of murdering his wife and her friend. And no wonder Leibovitz depicts Roseanne 
and Tom Arnold as a couple of mud-wrestlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Leibovitz operates like thousands of other graphic artists -- she's slick, 
stylish, eclectic and witty. She's even iconoclastic when it's socially 
acceptable. What makes her special is the way she pushes the envelope just far 
enough to achieve density. In her hands topical comedy becomes a subtle 
morality play. It tells us that the celebrity sphere is a ring of Purgatory 
reserved for those so insecure they must constantly ask the world for 
permission to just be themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Leibovitz's world is a glamorous, painful, hectic, hypocritical, sometimes 
lethal place. We see the exhaustion and loneliness of show folk on the road in 
the faces of Mick Jagger, Louis Armstrong and Ray Charles, all still bravely 
playing their parts. Jane Fonda or Joan Baez try to get a moment's peace with 
their men and, bang, somebody turns up with a camera. Try to smile, Tom. 
</P>
<P>
 Are we supposed to feel sorry for these people? They asked for this, after 
all. Their poignancy is all paradox. They wanted to be rich, powerful and 
famous and that has its price. 
</P>
<P>
 Two images get close to the bone. In one, Bob Dylan waters a pathetic little 
lawn in an anonymous apartment court while wearing white satin. The other shows 
a presidential honor guard rolling up the red carpet as Helicopter One rises. 
The unseen passenger is Richard Nixon in disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this has any resonance unless we assume that inside these public 
people there is a private one capable of reflection. When we look at Liberace 
or the ancient stripper Sally Rand in their sequins and rhinestones it's pretty 
clear there is nobody home but self-delusion. That's kind of lovable. 
</P>
<P>
 Leibovitz finds the most doubt in writers. Authors like Susan Sontag, Joan 
Didion and John Gregory Dunne look distracted -- as if wondering if this kind 
of notoriety is really necessary. Norman Mailer appears to relish acting macho 
in the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 The most unflattering portrayals are reserved for those -- like Donald Trump 
-- who are famous only for being ruthlessly rich. Everybody else, notably the 
movie people, have ironic or authentic fun allowing their complex personalities 
to be reduced to visual one-liners. Often Leibovitz hits veins of insight by 
playing against type. 
</P>
<P>
 Bette Midler was seen as kind of camp female female-impersonator until 
Leibovitz laid her down and brought out her sweetness by covering her with 
roses. Clint Eastwood is the avenging Dirty Harry to most of us, but Leibovitz 
was right on when she trussed him up like a cowboy about to be burned at the 
stake. Eastwood appeals to people who see themselves as victims. Steve Martin 
appears delighted to do an impersonation of a Franz Kline painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Impressively organized by the International Center of Photography in 
conjunction with the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery, the exhibition's 
curators are Willis Hartshorn and William Stapp. LACMA curator Robert Sobiezek 
supervised the local installation. 
</P>
<P>
 A handsome catalogue is more complete than the show itself and in some ways 
more rewarding. It's nice to look at photographs sitting down.

SCREENING ROOM: MEDIA DISTORTION TARGETED IN SHORT FILMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Filmforum's "Mediated Dreams" (tonight at 8 at Hollywood Moguls, 1650 Schrader 
St. (formerly Hudson) offers a program of short films attacking the media for 
its myriad distortions and misrepresentations.  
</P>
<P>
 By far the most provocative offering is Joel Katz's "Corporation With a Movie 
Camera," a succinct survey of how major corporations, from the silent era 
onward, have used the industrial film to project a false rosy future for those 
foreign countries where American companies have traditionally exploited cheap 
labor and natural sources; one of Katz's key targets, not surprisingly, is the 
United Fruit Company, creator of "banana republics."  
</P>
<P>
 Igor Vamos, in "Barbie Liberation Organization," has lots of fun sending up 
the excesses of TV news in the case of the recent incidents in which the voice 
boxes of the Barbie and G.I. Joe dolls were switched; unfortunately, Vamos, at 
nearly 30 minutes, indulges in serious overkill. Far more effective is Phil 
Patiris' sharp and ingenious "The Iraqi Campaign," a corrosive satire of the 
ways in which TV news exploited the Gulf War as show biz, whipping up 
jingoistic sentiment and trivializing the entire catastrophe.

 Urban Struggle: The UCLA Film Archive's "New Italian Cinema" series continues 
Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. in UCLA's Melnitz Theater with Gianluca Maria Tavarelli's 
reflective, low-key "Take Me Away," which offers an exceedingly bleak view of 
contemporary urban life -- at least as it is lived in Turin by people 
struggling to make ends meet -- but one that gradually draws you into it.  
</P>
<P>
 Sergio Troiano and Michele Di Mauro are wonderful as ordinary-looking 
35-year-old guys, unlucky in love and stuck in low-paying dead-end jobs. They 
are modern-day Martys who in the course of one of their endless, fruitless 
rounds of the discos cross paths with a pair of expensive, stunning-looking 
prostitutes (Stefania Orsolu Garello and France Demoulin, also impressive) they 
cannot afford. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point "Take Me Away" commences dividing its time between the two men 
and the two women. As we watch the men being ground down by their daily lives, 
we witness even worse in the case of the women, who are part of the countless 
numbers of Eastern European women flooding Western Europe and turning to 
prostitution for survival. As illegal immigrants, they truly are at the mercy 
of their extremely brutal pimps. The second encounter of these four people 
provides "Take Me Away" with a startling and effective finish.

 Cravings in Iran: Mohsen Makhmalbaf's "The Actor" (opening Wednesday at the 
Monica 4-Plex) offers an implicit criticism of the status of women in 
contemporary Iran, but it tends to get lost amid the wearying ranting between a 
famous roly-poly comedian (Akbar Abdi, playing a character of the same name) 
and his wife Simin (Fatemah Motamed-Aria). He longs for serious acclaim and 
artistic challenge but accepts strictly commercial assignments to pay for his 
wife's materialistic cravings; she in turn longs for a child obsessively, 
perceiving no other way of self-fulfillment.  
</P>
<P>
 In desperation she pays a young deaf-mute Gypsy (Mahaya Petrossian) to move in 
her home and become a surrogate mother. Unlike many Iranian films, this one, 
although subtitled in English, is likely to appeal only to Farsi-speaking 
audiences.

 Getting Even: The title of Richard Elfman's "Shrunken Heads" (Fridays and 
Saturdays at midnight), a limp horror comedy, refers to three New York 
neighborhood boys gunned down by a gang. The kindly local tobacconist (veteran 
actor Julius Harris, in an amusing portrayal) turns out to be a Haitian voodoo 
witch doctor. She restores life to the boys' heads and shrinks them, whereupon 
they become electrically charged mini-whirling dervishes, whizzing over 
Manhattan and capable of exacting terrible revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 The special effects are good, Richard Band's witty score even better, but 
that's about it.

CRISTIAN SHOWS TALENT, BUT ACT NEEDS POLISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LOPETEGUI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is Cristian, who made his U.S. debut on Friday night at the sold-out Universal 
Amphitheatre, a genuine talent -- or simply a show-biz phenom? 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-year-old Mexican sensation, son of soap opera superstar and singer 
Veronica Castro and himself a former child actor, certainly enthralled his 
mostly female fans with his performance, but questions remain. 
</P>
<P>
 Cristian (he only uses his first name) employed a varied and above-average 
selection of songs, especially ballads that exhibited far more character than 
the works used by most exponents of romantic Latin pop. The highlight was an 
especially sensitive, acoustic rendition in English of Sting's "Shape of My 
Heart." 
</P>
<P>
 The young singer exuded confidence and has put together a young and solid 
five-piece band. But he's still somewhat raw, showing limited command as a 
performer and often stumbling when trying to reach high notes. 
</P>
<P>
 The capacity crowd showed supreme patience, waiting nearly two hours for the 
concert to begin -- a delay caused by transportation problems involving 
Cristian's band, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was obvious when Cristian finally made it to the stage that he has some 
talent, but he needs to realize that he must work on both his singing and stage 
presence if he is to be more than simply a popular attraction. ENRIQUE

MUSIC REVIEWS; WALTER PONCE PLAYS BRAHMS IN PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a good night, as seemed to happen at its opening concert in October and 
again Saturday back in Civic Auditorium, the Pasadena Symphony plays like a 
major orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Its music director, Jorge Mester, puts together brilliant programs, then leads 
them with panache and intelligence, often achieving the right chemistry.The 
ensemble usually responds appropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its players are the cream of an instrumental talent pool unique to 
Southern California, and since the roster remains largely unchanged over the 
seasons, the results are admirable as well as reliable. 
</P>
<P>
 One variable among several, however, is the visiting soloist. That was the 
element that did not work Saturday and its non-workability caused dismay. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing Brahms' D-minor Piano Concerto on the concluding half of this 
performance, the Bolivian musician Walter Ponce delivered all the notes in 
correct sequence and with great and resourceful solidity. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he missed by far any re-creating of the Romantic heart of this work. This 
was doubly regrettable since the orchestra approached so closely the 
warm-hearted, dramatic core of Brahms' inspiration in a strong and striking 
performance by any yardstick. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponce -- whose appearance and stolid, workmanlike playing recalls that of the 
late lamented William Masselos -- seemed to apply to the surfaces of this 
familiar piece cleanser instead of polish. So well-scrubbed was the solo part, 
it was as if there were spaces between the notes. Alas, where Brahms requires 
legato and long, arching lines, the soloist provided choppiness and 
sectionalization. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first half, Mester & Co. beautifully unraveled Kodaly's complex 
"Peacock" Variations; before that, they brought their considerable art to a 
probably unworthy project, Erno von Dohnanyi's poppish "Symphonic Minutes."

MUSIC REVIEWS; NUANCED 'CANCIONES' BY MASTER CHORALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 However indefinable the quality we call taste may be, one thing is for sure: 
Paul Salamunovich has a lot of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The music director of the Los Angeles Master Chorale put together a program 
dubbed "Canciones para Los Angeles" that in less sensitive hands could have 
easily turned into the kind of thing where the entire choir ends up in 
sombreros, clicking castanets.Not even close, here. 
</P>
<P>
 Salamunovich (in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Saturday night) began this 
program, a collection of Spanish and Latin American music, with a Gregorian 
chant "Ave Maria," and segued into Victoria's 16th-Century setting of it, both 
sung with grace and warm nuance. He continued with 16th-Century New-World music 
by the little-known Fernando Franco and Fructos del Castillo, again projected 
in entirely un-zombie-like fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the harmonic thicket of Villa-Lobos' "Bendita Sabedoria," to the 
trumpeting textures of Jean Berger's "Brazilian Psalm," to the luxurious 
harmonies of Enrique Gonzalez Medina's "Sancta Maria," Salamunovich coaxed 
poised balances and elegant sonorities. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the choir's gently nuanced, understated performances made such 
potentially sentimental offerings as songs by Carlos Guastavino, and the "Songs 
of Mexico" arranged by Ramon Noble the highlights of the program. Mezzo-soprano 
Helene Quintana gave a winning, molto espressivo presentation of the mournful 
tango "El Chiquilin de Bachin" by Piazzolla. 
</P>
<P>
 Winds and percussion joined the chorale for Lalo Schifrin's eclectic "Cantares 
Argentinos," a 24-minute song cycle evoking the styles of Poulenc and 
Stravinsky, spicy, colorful and acerbic settings of interesting texts. Its 
dedicatees gave it a refined reading. TIMOTHY MANGAN

MUSIC REVIEWS; MCNAIR VERSATILE IN SOUTH BAY SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Soprano Sylvia McNair can sing Purcell with the immediacy of a classy Jerome 
Kern tune and Andre Previn with the poise of a baroque aria. Her voice is warm, 
even, focused and flexible, and her delivery, as heard in a program that also 
included works by Mozart, Schubert, Debussy and Bizet on Saturday in Marsee 
Auditorium at the South Bay Center for the Arts, is unaffected and deceptively 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Mansfield, Ohio, she also remains very much an American singer in her 
idiomatic vocal handling of the language and in the American mixed and sliding 
vowel sounds that occasionally creep into her singing. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was nothing provincial about her artistry. 
</P>
<P>
 She sang three Purcell songs and his semi-dramatic scena "The Blessed Virgin's 
Expostulation" with haunting sweetness and persuasive involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Previn's Four Songs (to words by Toni Morrison) showed a range from saucy 
Annie-Get-Your-Gun feminism to vulnerable confession. (Frances Steiner played 
the cello obbligatos with lean, amber tone.) 
</P>
<P>
 She was effortlessly secure and bright in the challenges of Mozart's concert 
aria, "Misera! dove son," K. 369, although less than ideally dramatic. Beauty 
of tone took precedence here over expression of textual urgency. 
</P>
<P>
 She was also secure in five seemingly simple Italian songs by Schubert that 
expose limitations as readily as arie antiche. None were exposed. 
</P>
<P>
 She sang Debussy's "Ariettes oubliees" with nuance and enunciation of model 
clarity. But she seemed freer in two songs by Bizet -- the impetuous yet 
hesitant youth in "La Coccinelle," and the elegantly spun-out filigree in 
"Tarentelle." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the program, pianist Hal France provided discreet accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
 For the single encore, McNair sang Leonard Bernstein's "I Hate Music." CHRIS 
PASLES

TV REVIEW; 'JIHAD IN AMERICA' PROBES RADICAL GROUPS IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the weapon of choice of many Islamic terrorists is the AK-47 rifle, the 
favored weapon of anti-terrorists seems to be the camcorder. Running through 
Steven Emerson's hourlong report, "Jihad in America," is a chilling string of 
video clips showing radical Islamic fundamentalists, organizers and terrorists 
urging followers to wage a holy war against Jews, Christians and America. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing surprising here -- only that the speeches were delivered in America, 
where, Emerson charges, a growing network linked with key Middle East-based 
terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas continues to elude U.S. law 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The safety of speech and religious freedom is the ironic reason, say law 
enforcement officials who speak to Emerson, that the FBI cannot round up those 
fomenting Jihad (or holy war) and those networked with the convicted bombers in 
the 1993 World Trade Center attack. Perhaps, but it seems to be a weak alibi in 
the light of decades' worth of very effective FBI harassment and arrests 
against many militants of the left and right. The real reason police don't go 
after Jihad's supporters in this country isn't explored here. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson begins his story with a beat-by-beat explanation of the growth of 
Islamic militancy -- with the careful caveat that this represents a fringe of 
the Islamic faith. CIA funding of Islamic forces against the Soviet Union in 
Afghanistan began a groundswell of confidence and money and arms for 
fundamentalists. An offshoot of this confidence was the Al-Kifah Support 
Network, based in Brooklyn, where such leading voices of Jihad as Abdullah 
Azzam would speak and organize. 
</P>
<P>
 It was here that the group responsible for the World Trade Center bombing 
often met, but it's only one of more than 30 militant Islamic groups in the 
United States, Emerson says. Despite denials by spokespeople, he identifies the 
Islamic Association for Palestine and the Islamic Committee for Palestine to be 
essentially the U.S. branches of terrorist groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson's reporting is dogged and more than slightly gutsy (how in the world 
did he obtain that videotape?), and makes a clear case that U.S. officials will 
be butting heads with the Constitution before they butt heads with terrorists.

TV REVIEW; A TUG OF WAR FOR CUSTODY OF A SON

<TEXT>
<P>
 Once you know that "Because Mommy Works" is about a custody fight, and if 
you've seen the news this year, you probably have an idea about the outcome of 
this new NBC movie. 
</P>
<P>
 The deck is steeply stacked, but the film is watchable, due to the caliber of 
the principal players, despite their black-hat, white-hat roles: Anne Archer as 
Abby, a dedicated cardiac nurse and loving mom; John Heard as the ex-husband 
dad, an arrogant, manipulative, hotshot photographer; Ashley Crow as his new 
stay-at-home, compliant wife, and, holding his own and then some, Casey Moses 
Wurzbach as Willie, the hapless little boy caught in the middle.He's an 
atypical TV kid, sweet-faced and natural. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Tom Amandes makes his role as Abby's incredibly sensitive, romantic, 
nurturing love interest almost buyable. 
</P>
<P>
 How Willie's dad woos his son with gifts and good times and forces his wife to 
take some hard knocks for being a professional woman will probably have some 
divorced fathers cheering, while working mothers seethe. 
</P>
<P>
 The real truth in this weeper, however, can be found in pint-sized Wurzbach's 
face, where emotional exhaustion is evident as the parent who wins in the end 
bears the boy away in triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, director Robert Markowitz, no fool, uses many silent close-ups of 
Wurzbach to poignant effect. Christine Berardo wrote the teleplay, from a story 
by Lynn Mamet and Marjorie David. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Because Mommy Works" airs at 9 tonight on NBC (Channels 4, 39 and 39).

IN THE END, RAMS DEALT ONE BAD HAND; PRO FOOTBALL: DEION SANDERS SLAPS BALL 
AWAY FROM FLIPPER ANDERSON IN END ZONE TO SAVE 49ERS' 31-27 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The right hand of Deion Sanders reached out and slapped aside the Rams' mighty 
grasp for a season-highlight victory, and so it goes for a team unable to close 
on success. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders' game-saving play, after being beat by wide receiver Flipper Anderson 
in the end zone, allowed the 49ers (9-2) to win, 31-27, before 62,774 in 
Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams (4-7) not only lost their ninth-consecutive game to the 49ers, but 
absorbed their fifth defeat in the past two months by seven or fewer points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We keep saying we're so close, but we can't win the games," said Anthony 
Newman, Ram safety. "Being close doesn't mean anything; when people look at our 
record, they will only look at wins and losses." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams fought back from a 21-6 halftime deficit to take a 27-24 lead in the 
fourth quarter, but the 49ers rallied with Jerry Rice, the NFL's all-time 
touchdown scorer. 
</P>
<P>
 On second and eight from the Rams' 18-yard line, Rice broke inside on 
cornerback Todd Lyght, caught a short pass from Steve Young, eluded the reach 
of linebacker Roman Phifer and scored the 136th touchdown to retake the lead 
with 1:56 left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I messed it up," Newman said. "They had called a lot of slants to the 
outside, and that's what I guessed, but then they went inside. I'm in the 
middle, but I went for John Taylor. They changed up on us." 
</P>
<P>
 Rice, who caught a club-record 16 passes -- third best in NFL history -- for 
165 yards including three for touchdowns, had fumbled on the previous series 
and had given the Rams an opportunity to gain an upset if they could run the 
final 6:07 off the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 An ineffective running game forced the Rams to pass to control the ball, but 
after gaining two yards on three plays, they punted and turned the ball to the 
NFL's No. 1 scoring unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was upset with myself for fumbling and very fortunate to have another 
opportunity," said Rice, who had 27 catches for 312 yards and four scores in 
two games against the Rams this season, while catching 46 passes for 717 yards 
and six scores in the team's other nine games. "Everything was on the line." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams called for a three-deep zone on the second-down play from their 18, 
but after Rice made the short reception, he avoided Lyght's tackling attempt 
and found no further interference before crossing the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 "'The play should have gone for five yards at the most," Lyght said. "A 
three-deep zone is supposed to stop that; that's the way you draw it up on the 
board." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams still had time to rally, and after taking possession at their 35, 
they moved quickly to the 49ers' 38 with a little less than a minute to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Quarterback Chris) Miller was getting hot and that started to scare me," 
said Coach George Seifert of the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who threw a 50-yard touchdown pass to Anderson and a 22-yard scoring 
pass to Jessie Hester in the second half, failed to make connections with 
Hester on first down. On second down, however, he spotted Anderson breaking 
free from Sanders and safety Dana Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another six inches and it's a touchdown," Anderson said. "There's nothing I 
could have done differently on the play -- we just came up a little short." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who worked out for the team's medical staff nearly three hours 
before the game to test an injured thigh, said he would not have played had it 
not been for an inspiring speech delivered by wide receiver coach Steve Moore. 
Despite being hurt, Anderson beat Sanders one-one-one for his 50-yard 
touchdown, and had him beat once again for the game-winning try. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's Deion's M.O.," said Chick Harris, Ram offensive coordinator. "He has a 
great ability to recover." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sanders, "That ball was right on the money. There was no time to think, 
just react." 
</P>
<P>
 A poor pass on third down coincided with a holding call on tackle Clarence 
Jones. The 49ers elected to take the penalty, push the Rams back to the 48-yard 
line and give them another third-down try rather than one last fling on fourth 
down from the 38. 
</P>
<P>
 A short pass to Hester was high, and broken up by 49ers' safety Merton Hanks, 
the hero in last week's 21-14 victory over Dallas. On fourth and 20, Miller 
rolled right and dumped a short pass to a wide open David Lang, who dropped the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took my focus off the ball because I was looking to run," Lang said. "The 
thing about it is we'll never know if I could have gotten the first down." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams fell behind, 14-3, after the first quarter with Young throwing to 
John Taylor for a seven-yard touchdown and Rice for another seven-yard score. 
Rice's six-yard touchdown reception with 38 seconds left in the half set the 
stage for the Rams' third-quarter rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Todd Kinchen, running the ball from scrimmage for the first time 
in the NFL, went 44 yards on the end around for a touchdown to open the 
second-half scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 A 28-yard field goal by Doug Brien kept the 49ers ahead, 24-12, but then 
Miller went on the attack, throwing to Anderson and Hester for scores, and 
setting up heroics by Rice and Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 "They make the big plays when they have to," said Miller, who returned after 
injuring his knee on the first Ram offensive play of the game to complete 16 of 
33 passes for 228 yards. "Deion made a game-saving play at the end, and we came 
out on the short end again. We're just so close to being a good team."

RAIDERS FIND IT'S NOT OVER TILL IT'S OVER; PRO FOOTBALL: EVERETT LEADS A 
FOURTH-QUARTER RALLY FOR NEW ORLEANS THAT FALLS SHORT, 24-19, BEFORE 41,772. 
L.A. IMPROVES TO 6-5.

<P>
 The Raiders might have trouble putting people in the seats, but they have no 
trouble keeping them there. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Sunday's 24-19 victory over the New Orleans Saints before only 41,772 at 
the Coliseum, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 With quarterback Jeff Hostetler throwing three touchdown passes and the Saints 
limited to 16 yards rushing for the game, the Raiders had a comfortable 24-7 
lead in the fourth quarter and, with about six minutes to play, they kicked 
back into cruise control. 
</P>
<P>
 That was a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 New Orleans was just kicking into high gear after a long and frustrating 
afternoon. Two quick touchdowns and one disastrous interception later, it was 
the Raiders who were on the edge, desperately trying to hang on with five 
seconds left and a potential winning pass from New Orleans quarterback Jim 
Everett in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Raider defensive back Derrick Hoskins knocked the ball harmlessly to the 
ground, enabling the Raiders to move above .500 at 6-5 and back into the 
playoff picture. 
</P>
<P>
 As bad as it was for the Raiders, it could have been worse had New Orleans 
Coach Jim Mora not gambled, calling for a two-point conversion when one point 
would have eventually helped his team's comeback chances. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hostetler had connected with Tim Brown on a 30-yard scoring play, 
Hostetler's second touchdown pass of the game to Brown, the Saints' Tyrone 
Hughes returned the ensuing kickoff 58 yards to give New Orleans its best field 
position of the afternoon at the Raider 39-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett was making his first appearance in Los Angeles since being traded from 
the Rams during the off-season. Until that point, his afternoon had been as 
frustrating as many of those he had spent in Anaheim Stadium over his last few 
seasons there. 
</P>
<P>
 But, with the game nearly out of reach, Everett awoke with a vengeance, 
completing four of six passes on a quick drive that culminated in a nine-yard 
touchdown pass to Torrance Small, who caught eight passes for 86 yards and two 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 When the clock stopped after the touchdown pass, 3:49 remained. With the 
Raiders leading, 24-13, a conversion kick would have left New Orleans a 
touchdown and a field goal short. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Mora gambled on a two-point conversion and lost when Everett's 
two-point pass attempt to Wesley Walls was broken up by James Trapp and Patrick 
Bates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have a whole lot of time left," Mora said. "I didn't look into the 
future. I just tried to decrease the points we were behind. I would do it 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Mora didn't have a monopoly on questionable plays. When Brown recovered an 
onside kick by New Orleans, the Raiders had the ball at the Saint 45-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Nice time to let that clock run and hold onto the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler, however, tried what he thought was a safe pass to Rocket Ismail, 
who earlier had caught a 17-yard touchdown pass. Hostetler figured, at the 
worst, he would throw the ball out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he threw it into the hands of New Orleans linebacker Winfred Tubbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It went haywire," Hostetler said. "That ball should never have been thrown. I 
wished I had that ball back a hundred times. It was not a good play. I was 
trying to get it out of bounds. What happened was the opposite." 
</P>
<P>
 Back came Everett and the Saints' offense. Back went the Raider defense on its 
collective heels. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again Everett drove the Saints downfield, completing five of six on a 
70-yard drive that culminated with a 14-yard touchdown pass to Small. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Mora had no choice. He had to go for two points. Again Everett went to 
Walls and again the Raiders broke it up. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints tried another onside kick and back the ball went into Brown's 
secure hands. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1:25 to play, New Orleans regained possession at its 20-yard line after a 
punt. But the failure of the two-point conversion had changed the game's final 
moments. Instead of being able to drive inside the Raider 40-yard line, where 
the powerful leg of kicker Morten Andersen would have had a shot at sending the 
game into overtime, the Saints, down by five, needed to score a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett, who completed 28 of 44 for 262 yards, made a valiant effort. 
</P>
<P>
 He got as far as the New Orleans 48-yard line, where a crushing sack by Nolan 
Harrison left Everett with only his last futile throw remaining in his arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 It wouldn't have been that close if the Raider offense hadn't played as though 
its players were meeting one another for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler completed 22 of 28 for 310 yards, using eight receivers. Brown 
caught eight passes for 132. But his 12-yard touchdown catch and a 51-yard 
field goal by Jeff Jaeger were the only Raider points in a first half marred by 
one offensive penalty after another. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the Raiders, who came into the game leading the NFL in penalties, did 
nothing to hurt their standing, committing 11 for 89 yards. Nine of those 
penalties were called on the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 That kept the game close. And, on the Raiders' first drive of the third 
quarter, Hostetler fumbled when hit by the Saints' Renaldo Turnbull. Hughes 
picked up the loose ball and raced 42 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, it appeared that would be the only time the 4-7 Saints would be 
heard from. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as those in the crowd who bothered to stay know only too well, the Saints 
were just getting started.

THE AIR DOWN THERE; MICHAEL JORDAN KEEPS SWINGING AWAY AS IMPROVEMENT SHOWS IN 
FALL LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Jordan tries to suppress a smile as he swings a bat in the on-deck 
circle at Scottsdale Stadium while an elderly woman in a nearby box seat reads 
aloud from his autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
 In the intimate environment of the Arizona Fall League, fans can reach out and 
touch Jordan as he continues an attempt to write an improbable new chapter to 
his life story. 
</P>
<P>
 At 31, a senior citizen to his double-A and triple-A teammates on the 
Scottsdale Scorpions, Jordan is challenging baseball from the bottom up after 
retiring from basketball still in his prime as perhaps the best player ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw this hill and chose to climb it," Jordan said in the Scorpions' 
clubhouse. "People laughed and said I was crazy, that I didn't have a chance, 
that it was strictly a publicity stunt. But who needs publicity with everything 
I've been through? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just taking this minute by minute. It's been a humbling experience but 
I'll keep going as long as I'm making progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, it would be a major accomplishment if I reached the major leagues at 
my age after not playing for 13 or 14 years, but there's no pressure. I don't 
have any expectations. I'm probably the last player on this team in terms of 
skill level, but I'm moving up and getting better along with the competition, 
and I'm having a good time, a lot more fun than if I was still playing 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were so many expectations in basketball, it was a shame." 
</P>
<P>
 There also were no more hills to climb, so here he is, about a year into his 
professional baseball career, having survived the media circus that was spring 
training and his debut at the tough double-A level. He considered bowing out 
but was talked into staying by Birmingham Manager Terry Francona, who is also 
Jordan's manager in this league, which started Oct. 6 and runs to Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, Jordan is ticketed for Nashville, the triple-A affiliate of the 
Chicago White Sox, on an obviously accelerated timetable. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a unique situation. A great athlete at 31 who knows, as Francona said, 
that it isn't going to happen overnight for him in baseball but isn't thinking 
of spending the rest of his career in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to speak for Michael, but I don't think this is a four- or 
five-year proposition," Francona said. "Michael wants to know (how far he can 
go) and the White Sox want to know. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now he's enjoying himself and holding his own against kids who have 
been playing (baseball) all of their life. For him to be able to compete in 
this league, against some of the top prospects in the game, I wouldn't have 
thought it would happen six months ago. I mean, it's pretty amazing that he's 
come this fast and a tribute to his dedication, determination and athletic 
ability." 
</P>
<P>
 Said shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, a Scorpion teammate who was the No. 1 draft 
choice of the Boston Red Sox in June, "I'm impressed. He's not just a guy 
trying to play. He is a player. And he's been packing 'em in, which has given 
all of us the opportunity to be seen by a lot of people. It's been exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 The Arizona Fall League has been an artistic success from the start. Of the 
326 players who played in the first two seasons, 107 already have reached the 
majors. However, until Jordan's arrival, most of the games drew only a couple 
dozen scouts. The league sold 21 season tickets last year. This year's sale was 
cut off at 2,200. Jordan's debut at Tempe drew 6,116 spectators, 311 more than 
the Tempe team drew for its entire home season last year. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this after Birmingham's 1994 attendance set a franchise record and was 
the sixth best in double-A history as their rookie right fielder batted .202 in 
127 games. He drove in 51 runs, stole 30 bases, hit three home runs and batted 
.380 in August, after asking Francona if he was doing the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he had suggested I was in over my head, I would have been out of there," 
Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Francona, "His big concern was that he was taking the place of someone 
more deserving. He was at a point all athletes reach at different times. He 
needed some reassurance and reinforcement. I told him he had come a lot further 
and faster than anyone would have believed, and he has. I mean, he jumped from 
high school to double-A with 13 years in between." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan is batting .255 in 30 Arizona games, playing both left and right field. 
He has no home runs, seven RBIs, two stolen bases and has struck out 27 times 
in 106 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a lean 6 feet 6 and many scouts see Jordan's swing as too long and too 
slow. The absence of power in his short pro career is a significant drawback 
for a corner outfielder. Still, scouts are impressed by his quick adaptability 
and patience at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "For someone who has basically never played, he has a lot of good at-bats, and 
the more he sees of breaking pitches the better he'll get," a National League 
scout said. "We're talking about a guy who dominated a very physical sport, and 
the fact that he comes in and struggles in baseball only shows how tough 
baseball is, beyond the athletic aspect." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Francona, "Michael knows he has to hit or he can't play. He knows he has 
to hit home runs or steal some bases or he can't play left field or right 
field. He can definitely steal bases, and I think there's some power potential 
there, but I just don't know how fast it will come. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's made a lot of adjustments and is at a point where he has a good stance 
and a . . . good idea of what he wants to do up there. I think his major 
adjustments are out of the way now. He just has to play more now and see how 
good he gets." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan calls it a crash course in fine tuning -- at bat, in the field and on 
the bases. The clock might be against him, but his maturity and athletic 
experience are advantages. He struck out three consecutive times in a recent 
game but refrained from any emotional display, hung in, and rapped a single in 
his fourth time up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't step outside myself and evaluate how much I've improved, but I know I 
have," he said. "I feel it in my comfort level and my overall feel for the 
game. I'm better able to anticipate now and adjust. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also think I have a lot going for me in the way of maturity. I see the 
younger players throwing helmets and kicking the water cooler and I know that 
only clutters your mind and adds to a sense of uncertainty. I know that only 
gets in the way of your ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know from basketball that some nights it's just not there. Nothing clicks. 
You have to absorb it, smile, move on, look forward to tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 The cynics and purists hammered Jordan and the White Sox initially. Many saw 
it only as repayment by White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf for Jordan's 
championship contributions to Reinsdorf's Chicago Bulls. Sports Illustrated, in 
a cover story, called it an embarrassment to baseball: Err Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, it remains a question, although the statistics would seem more than 
circumstantial. Jordan will probably get his shot at triple-A, then make a 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he said, the cynics fuel his motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what I want to do," he said. "There's nothing more involved. I 
started with baseball in high school, and now, ironically, it's where I'll 
finish. I just never thought I'd get the opportunity. Once I saw Deion 
(Sanders) and Bo (Jackson) playing two sports, I got the itch, but I knew I 
couldn't go back and forth between the sports. I had achieved everything I 
could in basketball. It was the perfect time to walk away." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Scorpions' clubhouse, where Jordan makes it a point to be one of the 
guys, sharing cartons of shoes and golf balls and other commercial products 
that arrive regularly, he keeps an eye on the television as the Phoenix Suns 
play their NBA season opener. Has he left some of his heart on the hardwood? 
Does he still feel a tug? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he said. "No regrets. I had my run. My only interest is that of an 
informed fan." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Schueler is more than a fan. At some point, the White Sox's general 
manager will have to help make a critical decision. 
</P>
<P>
 He says that Jordan has come a long way in a short time, but is there more? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll stick with what I said when Michael went to spring training," Schueler 
said. "It's a million to one (against his reaching the majors). 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, I can't believe he'd leave the one sport on top. Michael knows 
he'll never achieve the level in baseball that he did in basketball, but that's 
not to question his dedication and work ethic. How serious is he about this? 
Would you be riding buses if you were guaranteed $30 million a year for the 
next seven years?" 
</P>
<P>
 Schueler referred to endorsement contracts that bring Jordan about $85,000 a 
day. The income helps pay his almost daily green fees here, the bodyguards, the 
limos he turns over to teammates. It helps dilute the already minimal stress. 
Jordan might itch to reach the majors, but he will not take a shortcut, he 
said. He would not cross a picket line if the players' union is still on strike 
and he would not go strictly as a ticket attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "No way," he said. "All I'm trying to do is maintain my progress. The last 
thing I want to do is interfere in a labor situation and get my peers angry at 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, his appearances in the on-deck circle represent photo 
opportunities that camera-toting fans can't ignore. They stream toward the 
dugout, yelling for him to turn this way, that way. The elderly lady reads from 
his book. A security guard moves to the top step of the dugout, ordering the 
fans to retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan shakes his head later and says the fan involvement in baseball has been 
far more than he was used to in basketball, a virtual nightmare, he said, that 
can create undue pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think I'm there to pose for pictures or sign autographs instead of doing 
my job," he said. "I hear a lot, but I've trained myself to ignore it so that 
it doesn't become a distraction. So far I've been able to deal with it. 
Sometimes you just have to say no. I hope people understand." 
</P>
<P>
 If the White Sox ultimately have to say no, Michael Jordan said he will 
understand. For now, however, he thinks he is still inching up the hill.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thumbs up to the Rams for the kind of gutsy and intelligent performance Sunday 
night that might have beaten 26 of the other 27 NFL teams. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 They just weren't quite good enough to beat the team that has Steve Young, 
Jerry Rice and Deion Sanders. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco's 31-27 victory probably was the last in the L.A. Ram-49er 
series and certainly one of the best. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Six days before the Notre Dame-USC game at the Coliseum, former Fighting Irish 
stars Tim Brown and Rocket Ismail scored all three touchdowns for the Raiders 
in their victory over the New Orleans Saints. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It should also be noted that former Trojan blocker Don Mosebar helped to 
protect Jeff Hostetler during all three of those pass plays. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody could doubt the courage or competitive spirit of Jim Everett, who took 
some hard shots before rallying the Saints late in the fourth quarter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders' touchdown drive after the opening kickoff was a thing of beauty 
-- 87 yards in 10 plays, five runs, five completions in five attempts to four 
receivers, and no L.A. penalties. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 For those 5 minutes 51 seconds, they looked like the Super Bowl contenders 
that they should be. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But Hostetler, who had a pass intercepted in the final four minutes when he 
shouldn't have been throwing, continues to be guilty of trying to force things. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Like most teams, the Raiders aren't very good when they play prevent defense. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 The defense shut out New Orleans the rest of the game, the Saints' first 
touchdown coming on a return of a fumble recovery. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Most surprising statistic of the day: The Raiders weren't penalized in the 
first quarter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Least surprising: The Raiders finished with 11 penalties for 89 yards. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders must use the same generous crowd counter as the Clippers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Donahue put it best Saturday at the Rose Bowl. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We're red hot, but we've run out of games," the UCLA coach said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins were awesome the last two weeks, blasting Arizona State, 59-23, and 
cruising past USC, 31-19. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 However, they won only three of their first nine and their season is over at 
5-6. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It's a classic case of "what if." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If J.J. Stokes hadn't been sidelined most of the season, if Carl Greenwood 
hadn't gone down early, if Skip Hicks had been ready sooner, or if the 
injury-free players had reacted better to adversity, the Bruins would be 
receiving some kind of a bowl bid. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The caliber of the invitation USC will get probably will depend on how the 
Trojans fare against Notre Dame. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A repeat of their performance at the Rose Bowl would mean a 12th consecutive 
loss to the Fighting Irish to go along with four in a row to the Bruins. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The second half was a combination of UCLA being very good and USC something 
far less. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA was aggressive on defense, Stokes was Stokes, Sharmon Shah was 
ultra-tough, and Wayne Cook was cool and confident. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 USC reverted to its sloppy tackling of early in the season, couldn't make the 
big plays on offense and, for reasons unfathomable in a rivalry such as this, 
appeared to get outhustled. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't play up to their emotional level," USC center Jeremy Hogue said. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the Trojans' errors were unforced. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Cole Ford, the long-ball kicker, booted two kickoffs out of 
bounds, giving the Bruins good field position at their 35-yard line, from where 
they mounted touchdown drives. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What was supposed to be the fight of the year wasn't even the fight of the 
month at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The suspense to Roy Jones' 12-round victory over James Toney on Friday 
evaporated after about a minute when it became apparent that Jones was too 
quick for a super middleweight who had weighed 208 pounds a few weeks earlier. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 An uncommon talent with a common name, Jones is probably the best fighter 
pound-for-pound because he has the punching power that Pernell Whitaker lacks. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 But there might not be anybody to test Jones. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon got to Pasadena the best way -- through the front door.

 YEAH, BUT YOU CAN GET A REALLY GOOD SLURPEE THERE 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys were sending out an SOS after they lost quarterbacks Troy Aikman 
(knee) and Rodney Peete (thumb) and finished their 31-7 victory over Washington 
with third-stringer Jason Garrett. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to find us a quarterback," said Coach Barry Switzer. "There's none 
at the 7-11. But we have to find somebody. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't rack the table and quit. We still have to play the last five balls." 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Jerry Jones said the Cowboys will "go with what we got" in their next 
game, on Thursday, and start searching next week. But they can't be 
extravagant. They're only $40,000 under the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redskins also used three quarterbacks in the game -- Gus Frerotte, John 
Friesz and Heath Shuler. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know, six quarterbacks in one game has to be an NFL first," Switzer 
said. "It at least ties a record." TELL US WHAT YOU REALLY THINK 
</P>
<P>
 After being sacked twice and throwing an incomplete, fourth-down pass with 
time running out in a 12-6 loss to the Arizona Cardinals, Philadelphia Eagle 
quarterback Randall Cunningham was thoroughly disgusted with the day's events. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way we played, we can't beat anybody," Cunningham said. "We couldn't beat 
a Pop Warner squad." MISSING: VIKING PASS DEFENSE 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Minnesota Vikings allowed New England's Drew Bledsoe to set NFL 
records with 45 completions and 70 attempts. On Sunday, the New York Jets' 
Boomer Esiason picked apart the Vikings for 22 completions in 29 attempts. He 
threw three touchdowns, and was not intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the second consecutive week the Vikings couldn't intercept a pass, 
and they were unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not what we're doing different now, it's what teams are doing 
differently against us," cornerback Anthony Parker said. "We have to have our 
leadership step up and we need to make some big plays." IT COULD HAVE BEEN A 
DISASTER 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle defeated Tampa Bay on a seven-yard touchdown run by Mack Strong with 
42 seconds left. Seahawk offensive coordinator Larry Kennan, with no timeouts 
remaining, caught the Buccaneers sleeping. They were expecting a pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Coach Tom Flores: "Larry called the play and I said, 'Wait a minute.' But 
then I thought if we got outside the pass rush, only defensive backs would be 
left." AN EXPENSIVE LESSON 
</P>
<P>
 We know they do things big in Texas. But sometimes, they go a bit overboard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys, who were fined $10,000 by the league for failing to report Troy 
Aikman's thumb injury prior to last week's game against San Francisco, complied 
with the letter of the law this week. 
</P>
<P>
 They issued a post-game injury report that included 15 names: Aikman (sprained 
medial collateral ligament in his left knee), Peete (sprained right thumb), 
cornerback Larry Brown (left elbow contusion), linebacker Dixon Edwards 
(sprained right foot), defensive end Charles Haley (sprained right big toe), 
wide receiver Alvin Harper (bruised lower back), defensive tackle Chad Hennings 
(sprained right ankle), wide receiver Michael Irvin (sprained right quad), 
guard Derek Kennard (reaggravated sprained right big toe), guard Nate Newton 
(reaggravated sprained ankle), linebacker Godfrey Myles (sprained right knee), 
linebacker Darrin Smith (left calf contusion), running back Emmitt Smith 
(reaggravated left shoulder sprain), cornerback Kevin Smith (reaggravated 
sprained right Achilles tendon) and guard Ron Stone (sprained right elbow). 
TONIGHT'S GAME: N.Y. Giants at Houston 
</P>
<P>
 6 p.m., Channel 7 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants (3-7) have lost seven consecutive games and the Oilers have lost 
six. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers are 1-9, but with the exception of last week, the losses have 
rarely been the fault of the defense. That is why defensive coordinator Jeff 
Fisher was elevated to head coach to replace the fired Jack Pardee. 
</P>
<P>
 Offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride was also fired, so the run-and-shoot 
offense will be scrapped except for when the team is way behind. Chances are 
you'll still see a lot of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Joe Tolliver has been named the starting quarterback after directing the 
Oilers to their best offensive showing this season last week. He completed 20 
of 34 passes for 142 yards and the Oilers scored a season-high 31 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was that the Bengals -- a team nickname usually preceded by the 
word hapless -- scored 33 points against the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Dave Brown returns to the starting lineup for the Giants after 
Kent Graham's dismal debut, He completed nine of 26 passes for 92 yards and an 
interception in a 10-9 loss to the Arizona Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants need to establish the running game to help their young quarterback, 
but everyone knows that, so opposing defenses stack the line to stop the run 
and dare the Giants to throw. 
</P>
<P>
 So far that strategy has worked. NOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 Block party: Green Bay kicker Chris Jacke had an extra-point blocked for the 
first time in his six-year career. . . . Buffalo wide receiver Billy Brooks 
made the 500th reception of his career, moving into 39th place on the NFL list. 
. . . He coaches better on a full stomach: In his six seasons, Detroit Coach 
Wayne Fontes is 24-32 in games played before Thanksgiving and 18-12 from 
Thanksgiving on. . . . Catchy leader: With 55 points, Herman Moore leads the 
Lions in scoring; the last Detroit receiver to pace the team in scoring for a 
season was Bill Gabrell in 1968. . . . There's no place like, uh, never mind: 
The Indianapolis Colts are having remarkable success at Cincinnati's Riverfront 
Stadium, where they haven't lost since 1980. Their only recent year without a 
victory at Riverfront was 1991, when the teams didn't play each other. . . . 
Kevin Williams' 83-yard punt return for a touchdown was the fourth-longest in 
Cowboy history. . . . Brian Mitchell established a Redskin single-season record 
with 1,192 yards in kickoff returns. Mitchell also had 229 all-purpose yards, 
giving him a club-record 1,873 for the season. . . . The Cowboys have won 13 
consecutive against the NFC East. The last time they lost to a division rival 
was the 1993 season opener to the Redskins, 35-16. . . . Dallas has met 
Washington 70 times in the Cowboys' 35-year history, the most games the Cowboys 
have played against any team. Dallas improved its overall record against 
Washington to 39-29-2. . . . Mike Tomczak's 343 passing yards were a Steeler 
high since Neil O'Donnell's 355 yards at Cleveland on Oct. 24, 1993. . . . 
Running in place: The 37 rushing yards were a season-low for Miami. . . . The 
four sacks by Pittsburgh were the most by a Miami opponent since the New York 
Jets also had four on Sept. 12, 1993. . . . Dan Marino, sacked only 10 times 
previously in 10 games, has never been sacked more than five times. He has been 
sacked 174 times in 165 career starts. Marino has 21 touchdown passes, but only 
four with six interceptions in his last four games. . . . The Steeler defense 
has allowed a league-low 13 touchdowns. . . . Miami has scored only 12 points 
in the first quarter all season. . . . Passing grade: Drew Bledsoe set Patriot 
records of 285 completions and 507 pass attempts in one season. The previous 
marks were 276 completions by Tony Eason in 1986 and 473 attempts by Babe 
Parilli in 1964. . . . New York Jet receiver Art Monk extended his streak of 
consecutive games with a catch to 174. Monk is chasing Steve Largent's record 
of 177 games. . . . Moon rise: Minnesota quarterback Warren Moon's two 
touchdown passes gave him 210, moving him into 14th place on the all-time list, 
one ahead of Jim Hart. Moon's 400 yards also made him the first Minnesota 
quarterback to have two 400-yard games in a season. UPON FURTHER REVIEW . . . 
</P>
<P>
 NBC commentator Paul Maguire was irate about the officiating down the stretch 
of Denver's 20-13 victory over Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 A fumble by the Browns kept two questionable fourth-down pass-interference 
calls against Kansas City from affecting the outcome. Maguire was also incensed 
by an intentional-grounding call against Cleveland quarterback Mark Rypien on a 
play on which he was hit before letting the ball go. 
</P>
<P>
 The referees made 24 calls in that game, 15 against the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the day's most critical mistake by officials was made in Miami's 
16-13 overtime loss to Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 During the overtime, the Dolphins faced a third and 19 at the Steeler 47, when 
an apparent completion to O.J. McDuffie inside the 20 squirted loose after he 
hit the ground. The Steelers recovered and argued it was a fumble; the Dolphins 
said McDuffie was down on contact. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials called it incomplete, although TV replays showed McDuffie taking 
several steps before striking the turf. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was definitely a completed pass," McDuffie said. "Even if the ball came 
out, it wasn't a fumble. That was a completed pass." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins ended up punting, and the Steelers drove downfield and kicked the 
winning field goal. . . . . WE LOVED INSTANT REPLAY 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego Chargers trailed the New Patriots, 10-3, when they apparently 
were victimized by the officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers' Dennis Gibson intercepted a pass by Drew Bledsoe at the New 
England 35. But linebacker Junior Seau was called for roughing the passer, 
although replays indicated he swatted his right arm at Bledsoe's helmet but 
never touched him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He swung a roundhouse with an open hand, in my judgment, and hit the side of 
the quarterback's head," referee Gordon McCarter said. A HEAD COACH WITHOUT A 
BIG HEAD 
</P>
<P>
 New Oiler Coach Jeff Fisher, who makes his debut tonight, has been called 
"Buddy Ryan without the ego." His friends and colleagues agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that describes Jeff pretty well. He has his ego in check," San 
Francisco General Manager Carmen Policy said of Fisher, who was the 49ers' 
defensive backs coach before going to Houston to become the defensive 
coordinator. He was promoted to head coach last week when Jack Pardee was 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Said USC Coach John Robinson: "I knew Jeff as a player, and I've known him as 
a coach. He has always had that sparkle in his eyes. Even back in college, Jeff 
had the look of a guy who was going to be a leader of men. He knew what he 
wanted to do. I think giving this job to Jeff is a great call by the Oilers." 
INJURY REPORT 
</P>
<P>
 The Arizona Cardinals lost two offensive starters in three plays against the 
Philadelphia Eagles. On the second play of the second quarter, Cardinal left 
tackle Luis Sharpe injured ligaments in his right knee when an Eagle player 
rolled over it as Sharpe was blocking for running back Ronald Moore. Two snaps 
later, wide receiver Randal Hill pulled a muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills' Thurman Thomas bruised his left knee and offensive lineman Corbin 
Lacina injured his left foot. . . . The Packers' Reggie White sprained his left 
elbow making a tackle. Also injured were Tim Hauck, who sprained a knee, 
defensive lineman John Jurkovic, who injured his right leg in the fourth 
quarter, and wide receiver Anthony Morgan, who suffered a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolphin linebacker Chris Singleton injured his ankle. . . . Steeler defensive 
end Gerald Williams tore a tricep and guard Todd Kalis left in the fourth 
quarter with a sprained ankle. . . . Seahawk tailback Chris Warren injured his 
right hip after gaining 116 yards on 16 carries. The Seahawks also lost 
starting cornerback Carlton Gray, who broke his right forearm.

RAM NOTEBOOK; HENLEY TO BE HOSPITALIZED OVERNIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ram officials said cornerback Darryl Henley would spend the evening in a local 
hospital after suffering a torn hip flexor muscle in Sunday's game against the 
49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley was injured while covering John Taylor with 1 minute 4 seconds 
remaining in the first half. He had to be supported by trainers as he left the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Chris Chandler and guard Leo Goeas worked out more than two hours 
before the game to determine if they could play, but in both cases they were 
unable to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Goeas has been sidelined because of an abdominal muscle pull and Chandler is 
trying to come back from an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "With four offensive starters out of there, and since they play so well 
against the run, we knew we'd have to throw on them," Ram Coach Chuck Knox 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, hurt the most along the offensive line, continue to struggle while 
trying to run the ball. Running back Jerome Bettis, who was limited to 13 yards 
in 10 carries against the Raiders, gained 29 yards in 15 rushes Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're just so banged up," Bettis said. "We had the chance to finish them off, 
but just couldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' offensive woes appeared to worsen after their initial play. 
Quarterback Chris Miller, who was back to pass, was sacked by rookie Bryant 
Young and injured his knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very concerned about Chris," Knox said. "But he wanted to come back 
in. They taped him up and he came back and played an excellent game." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller missed one offensive series and was replaced by Tommy Maddox, who 
completed three of four passes for 55 yards, leading the Rams into position for 
Tony Zendejas' 31-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Rice's 16 receptions set a 49er team record, and tied him for third on 
the all-time list with St. Louis' Sonny Randle (1962). The Rams' Tom Fears 
holds the NFL mark with 18 catches against Green Bay in 1950. The Giants' Clark 
Gaines is No. 2 at 17 (1980). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ram offensive coordinator Chick Harris paid tribute to his players for not 
packing it in after falling behind, 21-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all the adversity and everything else that has happened, you have to 
give them credit for playing hard," he said. "They were right there until the 
very end." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco cornerback Deion Sanders, considered the best coverage man in 
the game, had his share of problems against Ram receiver Flipper Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who missed practice this week because of a deep thigh bruise, caught 
five passes for 99 yards, all in the second half. He beat Sanders down the 
sideline for a 50-yard touchdown catch the cut the Rams' deficit to five points 
with 3:21 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like being a great baseball pitcher and throwing a shutout for seven 
innings and then giving up six runs," Sanders said of his second-half slump. "I 
just wasn't comfortable out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Anderson: "The ball went over Deion's head as he was looking back for 
it," Anderson said. "It was a mistake. He's a great defensive back, but he's 
not Superman. He can be beat too." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders got revenge on the Rams' final drive of the game, when he batted away 
Miller's 38-yard pass to Anderson in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I had it," Anderson said, "another six inches and it would have 
been a touchdown. Deion made a hell of a play." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before the game, Ram cornerback Todd Lyght predicted the 49ers' first play 
from scrimmage would be a pass to Jerry Rice, but he was one down off. The 
49ers handed off to Ricky Watters on first down, but Steve Young threw 12 yards 
on second down to Rice, who beat Lyght on the coverage. . . . Jessie Hester's 
17-yard reception in the second quarter extended his streak of games with at 
least one catch to 73.

WHEN A VICTORY FEELS LIKE A DEFEAT; 49ERS: SAN FRANCISCO IS AT A LOSS FOR 
POSITIVE WORDS AFTER PLAYING DOWN TO RAMS' LEVEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As he finished dressing at his locker room stall, San Francisco safety Tim 
McDonald sounded like a guy whose team had just lost to the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mom said there would be days like this," he said. "This was a tough one. 
We'll bounce back from this." 
</P>
<P>
 Wait a minute. Check that scoreboard again. In case he missed it, it read: San 
Francisco 31, Rams 27. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald and his 49er teammates ask to be excused for, well, playing to the 
4-7 Rams' level Sunday at Candlestick Park. Coming off an emotional victory 
over Dallas last week, the 49ers had to resort to a comeback to beat the Rams 
for the ninth-consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't beat up anybody (Sunday)," 49er quarterback Steve Young said. "But 
this is a great way to win. But we would have cursed ourselves if we lost this 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't because Young threw four touchdown passes, including three to 
Jerry Rice -- the last an 18-yarder that gave the 49ers a 31-27 lead with 1:56 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams came to play," said Rice, who caught a club-record 16 passes for 165 
yards. "After they went up, 27-24, in the fourth quarter, our offense knew we 
had to do something because there was a lot of talk coming from their side. 
</P>
<P>
 "They felt like they had us, and they really started talking." 
</P>
<P>
 Talk from a frustrated team that has little or no chance for the playoffs and 
has lost by an average of 21 points in the past three meetings against the 
49ers? 
</P>
<P>
 "We struggled a little with these guys," McDonald said. "We need to learn to 
play well every week. We have to remind ourselves that the Rams get paid to 
play each week, just like we do." 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone on the 49er roster has grown accustomed to blowing out the 
Rams twice a year. Young's comeback reminded 49er left guard Jesse Sapolu of 
another Bay Area quarterback who made a living by beating the Rams with 
last-second comebacks. What was his name again . . . ? 
</P>
<P>
 "A game like this is good not just for the team and all that, but especially 
for Steve Young," Sapolu said. "Before Steve, I was snapping the ball to a guy 
named Joe Montana, and this was a Joe Montana kind of comeback." 
</P>
<P>
 The comeback almost never happened because the usually sure-handed Rice 
fumbled the ball away after catching a six-yard pass from Young with 6:07 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram linebacker Shane Conlan knocked the ball loose from Rice, and defensive 
end Gerald Robinson recovered it at the Rams' 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody panicked when Jerry fumbled the ball," offensive tackle Harris Barton 
said. "Hey, Jerry has made a lot of money for me over the years." 
</P>
<P>
 No need to panic, because the 49ers got the ball back less than a minute later 
when the Rams moved the ball two yards before punting. 
</P>
<P>
 Young engineered a 10-play, 67-yard drive that culminated with the pass to 
Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw Jerry catch the ball, and I thought what a perfect scenario that was 
after he fumbled earlier," Sapolu said. "When you're a great player like him, 
sometimes things go your way."

EVERETT OUT OF TIME, SAINTS OUT OF LUCK; PRO FOOTBALL: QUARTERBACK LEADS NEW 
ORLEANS TO TWO FOURTH-QUARTER TOUCHDOWNS, BUT HE CAN'T BEAT THE CLOCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Timing has never been Jim Everett's strength and it wasn't Sunday in the 
Raiders' 24-19 victory over New Orleans at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first game in Los Angeles since being traded by the Rams to the Saints 
during the off-season, Everett struggled for three quarters before leading New 
Orleans to a furious comeback in the final five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett, who began the game with 14 touchdown passes, passed for two scores 
and came close to a third only to run out of time on the Saints' final drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Did Everett feel added pressure returning to Los Angeles after spending eight 
seasons with the Rams? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, because we had enough pressure as a team to win," said Everett about the 
Saints, who dropped to 4-7 in the NFC West. "We needed this game so badly that 
it didn't matter whether we were playing here or in Alaska." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett completed 28 of 44 passes, but his final three drives of the game 
showed why he is a quarterback not to be overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Raiders ahead, 24-7, Everett completed 12 of 18 passes for 135 yards, 
including two touchdown throws to Torrance Small in the final 3:49. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that Jim played very well in the second half," New Orleans Coach 
Jim Mora said. "He's a good football player who competes right down to the last 
second. His problem today was that he didn't get much help from our running 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Saints' last three possessions, Everett completed passes underneath, 
downfield and in between against a Raider secondary that played without Lionel 
Washington and Albert Lewis.  
</P>
<P>
 "We just started executing better and moved the ball," Everett said. "We are a 
team that just keeps fighting, but we didn't score enough at the end to win the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 It was clear the Saints wanted to throw away from Pro Bowl cornerback Terry 
McDaniel and at inexperienced covermen James Trapp and Donald Frank. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true that we wanted to throw at the other guy instead of McDaniel," New 
Orleans offensive coordinator Carl Smith said. "But (Trapp) did a good job on 
us. He allowed some plays in front of him, but he made plays when he needed to 
early." 
</P>
<P>
 So why did the Saints have success late in the game? 
</P>
<P>
 "We just blocked better, caught the ball better and I threw the ball better," 
Everett said. "But the Raiders also played a little more zone without so many 
different looks at the end." 
</P>
<P>
 In the first half, Everett completed 11 of 17 passes for 96 yards. His problem 
came on the scoreboard as the Raiders kept the Saints scoreless. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came out and shut us down -- not so much that they stopped us from 
moving the ball, but we just didn't execute well enough to put points on the 
board," Everett said. "The Raiders had a great game plan and they have a great 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Saint rookie running back Mario Bates gained a season-high 141 yards and 
scored two touchdowns in a victory over Atlanta last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the Raiders, however, New Orleans' rushing game was stuffed by linemen 
Chester McGlockton, Nolan Harrison, Jerry Ball and Anthony Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt going in that it would be difficult running the ball against the 
Raiders because of their defensive front," Mora said.

RAIDER DEFENSE DOES IT WITHOUT THE ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Without much fanfare, the Raiders have quietly become a defensive force. 
</P>
<P>
 After a last-second loss to San Diego on Sept. 25, the Raiders have not 
allowed more than two offensive touchdowns in a game and the streak was 
extended Sunday in a 24-19 victory over New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders held the Saints' offense scoreless for 56 minutes until Jim 
Everett passed for two late touchdowns. New Orleans' first score came on a 
42-yard fumble return by Tyrone Hughes in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they are very, very, very talented football team," New Orleans Coach 
Jim Mora said. "They are real tough to run on and they make plays in the 
secondary." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry McDaniel has been one of the league's best cornerbacks for the last 
several years, but only this season has he begun to be recognized as such, 
thanks to seven interceptions -- including one Sunday against Everett. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are other Raiders who are having solid seasons, including safety 
Eddie Anderson, linebacker Winston Moss and linemen Chester McGlockton, Jerry 
Ball, Nolan Harrison and Anthony Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 This was never more evident than against the Saints. 
</P>
<P>
 Against New Orleans, Moss had a solid all-around game with three tackles, good 
pass defense and a key 11-yard sack of Everett in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 McGlockton, who Coach Art Shell predicts will be a perennial Pro Bowl player, 
had three big hits on Saint running back Mario Bates, a near interception and 
several pressures on Everett. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison who moved to defensive end after the fourth game of the season, is 
having his best season in his four years as a pro. He constantly was in the 
Saint backfield, sacking Everett twice for minus-19 yards and had five tackles 
over all. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball, who signed as a free agent during the off-season, has displayed an 
uncanny knack for guessing the snap count. Ball used his quickness to force 
Everett into two incompletions on third downs. 
</P>
<P>
 So after shutting down several of the leagues' best offenses over the last two 
months, including New England, Miami, Atlanta and New Orleans, do the Raiders 
think that their defense is underrated? 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't get too carried way with that," McDaniel said. "We have to play 
each game hard. Every week should be like a playoff game and we should approach 
each like that."

TWO FRESHMAN BASKETBALL PLAYERS SUSPENDED BY LOYOLA FOR '94-95 SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two freshman basketball players have been suspended for the season by Loyola 
Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
 Terryl Woolery, a 6-foot-4 guard from Fairfax High, and Will Jones, a 6-5 
forward from Chicago, were suspended for "violation of the University's Student 
Conduct Code," according to a statement released by the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither played Sunday night in the Lions' 111-83 exhibition victory over Blue 
and Gold Fleet at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach John Olive could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Olive called Woolery "a steal," adding: "He's going to be a 
very, very talented player." 
</P>
<P>
 Woolery was an All-City pick last season at Fairfax, averaging 16.5 points, 
7.8 rebounds and 4.3 assists. Jones averaged 10.8 points and 6.4 rebounds at 
Chicago Mt. Carmel High.

GIRLS' BASKETBALL 1994-1995 / GOLDEN WEST LEAGUE; 1993-94 IN REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Highlights 
</P>
<P>
 This is the Golden West League's inaugural season. Saddleback and Tustin 
arrive from the Sea View League and Ocean View, Santa Ana, Rosary and 
Westminster move over from the Sunset League.Ocean View, last season's Sunset 
League champion, and Tustin (third in the Sea View League) were the new 
league's only teams to reach the playoffs last season. Ocean View (23-5 
overall, 12-2 in league) finished the regular season ranked sixth in the Orange 
County sportswriters' poll. The Seahawks reached the Southern Section Division 
II-AA semifinals, where they lost to eventual champion Woodbridge, 49-38. 
Tustin (17-10, 9-5) lost to Hacienda Heights Wilson in the first round of the 
Division II-A playoffs, 68-55. Two Ocean View seniors, Farrah Magee (12.7 
points per game), and Dustine Yamamoto, plus Westminster's Lisa Tamamasui and 
Rosary's Jennifer Chey were first-team, All-Sunset League selections. 
Yamamoto's .787 free-throw percentage ranked her third in Orange County. Chey, 
who averaged 16.3 points, was fourth in the county with a .736 free-throw 
percentage. Tustin's Sarah Davis and Katie Scheuerman were first-team All-Sea 
View League selections. Davis averaged 12.3 points and 9.4 rebounds and was the 
Bolsa Grande tournament's MVP. Scheuerman, who averaged 14 points, was also an 
all-league selection in 1992-93. Westminster (10-15, 5-9) finished fourth in 
the Sunset League last season, and Saddleback (4-18, 0-14 in Sea View League 
play) and Santa Ana (11-15, 3-11 in Sunset League play) each finished eighth in 
their respective leagues.

 Now is the time for Westminster to be a playoff-contending team. With eight 
seniors and five juniors on this year's squad, there's no time like the 
present. Katz believes with Farroux and Schult, both 6-2, the Lions can compete 
with anyone in the paint. The two combined for 14 points and 13 rebounds per 
game last season. Farroux, who signed a letter of intent with Nevada Las Vegas, 
is expected to be one of the top players in the league. Both she and Kavan 
(eight points and three assists per game) are four-year varsity players with 
valuable experience. Ramirez (5.7 points) also has three years of varsity time 
under her belt. Along with their post game, Katz believes the Lions have good 
perimeter shooting and an excellent pressure defense. Seniors Noland (transfer 
from Estancia) and Erickson (transfer from Rancho Alamitos) will be asked to 
fit into the Lions' plan immediately. Moore, last year's junior varsity MVP, 
has excellent skills.

GIRLS' BASKETBALL 1994-1995 / GOLDEN WEST LEAGUE; LATE START DOES NOT HOLD BACK 
FARROUX; BASKETBALL: WESTMINSTER STAR DID NOT TAKE UP THE GAME UNTIL HIGH 
SCHOOL. SHE HAS EARNED A SCHOLARSHIP TO PLAY AT NEVADA LAS VEGAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Before she entered high school, Amber Farroux had never played organized 
basketball.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, she is the first Westminster girls' basketball player to sign a letter of 
intent with a Division I school -- Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had players play at Division I schools, but not straight out of high 
school," Lion Coach Dick Katz said.  
</P>
<P>
 It was Katz who convinced Farroux to come out for the basketball team her 
freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a cheerleader and he asked me if I would want to try out for the 
basketball team," Farroux said. "I decided to give it a try."  
</P>
<P>
 She gave it a try and made the varsity team her freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had raw ability and made the team on hard work," Katz said. "She has 
always been a hard worker. Both in practice and in games, she gives 100% all 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Farroux struggled with injuries during her sophomore and junior seasons and 
she was not even considered for the All-Sunset League team. This, combined with 
her late start in the game, combined to make her signing with UNLV that much 
more remarkable, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was between her sophomore and junior seasons that Katz believed Farroux 
started to become a more competitive basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
 "She started to take her game to a higher level," Katz said. "Her inside game 
improved and things started to come together. 
</P>
<P>
 "This summer, she has worked even harder to make her game a more complete 
game. At this point, she can play inside or outside. She's a better shooter now 
and she's more well-rounded in all facets of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with two to three hours of practice a day, Farroux spends several extra 
hours per week on her shooting, post game and ball handling. During the 
off-season, she participated with the school's volleyball and track and field 
team. She is a two-year varsity middle blocker and runs the 400 meters and high 
jumps.  
</P>
<P>
 Farroux, 17, believes it's her intensity and love for basketball that makes 
her work even harder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the game and I hate to lose," she said. "I love people that like to 
play hard.. . . What it takes to win is to play hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Farroux credits Westminster softball Coach Gretchen Bock for teaching her how 
to prepare mentally for each game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gretchen taught me to imagine what the game will be like, from start to 
finish. Just preparing ahead of time by yourself and setting goals, both for 
yourself and your team, helps a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 With the graduation of Lisa Tamamasui, one of Westminster's top players last 
season, Farroux will be asked to be the team's leader. It's a job she looks 
forward to. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last season, we had Lisa and she handled a lot of that responsibility," Katz 
said. "But this season, Amber will have to take on more of that responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her intensity makes everyone she plays with on the court better. They realize 
that if they are going to survive on the court with her, they better play hard 
with her. She does not accept any lack of concentration from her teammates, and 
they have followed her example." 
</P>
<P>
 Farroux has played with the varsity for three seasons and has been on some 
tough-luck teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Amber arrived her freshman year, the team had won one game in five 
years," Katz said. "But as she has gotten better, the team has also improved. 
Practices are more spirited, players are more eager to play and to work hard. I 
think she believes that winning is important." 
</P>
<P>
 Farroux agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personal goals are nice, but I always try to work hard to make the team 
better. My goals are to help this team win our league, make the playoffs and 
win CIF."

FREEDOM BOWL GIVES UTAH ANOTHER SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Utah, runner-up in the Western Athletic Conference, has been selected to play 
in the Dec. 27 Freedom Bowl, the bowl committee said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be the second consecutive Freedom Bowl appearance for Utah (9-2).The 
Utes lost to USC, 28-21, last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah will face either Arizona or Washington State. The opponent will be 
determined after Arizona and Arizona State play Friday. The bowl coalition gets 
its pick of a Pac-10 team before the Freedom Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 If the coalition picks USC, Arizona would come to the game with a victory over 
Arizona State. If Arizona wins and is selected by the coalition, Washington 
State would play Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 By mutual agreement, USC will not make a third consecutive appearance in the 
game.

SERVITE JUST KEEPS ON KICKING WITH SMITH; WATER POLO: JUNIOR STANDOUT HAS HIS 
OWN WAY OF DOING THINGS, CLASHING WITH THE COACH AT TIMES, BUT HE GETS THE JOB 
DONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Servite water polo standout Jerry Smith could use a rest, but this wasn't what 
he was looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 As Marina cut into Servite's lead in the semifinals of the Southern Section 
Division II playoffs Saturday, Smith stood on the pool deck in a T-shirt and 
jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, the team's leading scorer, was serving a one-game suspension after 
being called for a major ejection in a game Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them to not let it get close," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, second-seeded Servite won, 17-14, and advanced to the final 
against Esperanza on Wednesday at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 This time you can be sure, Smith won't be left high and dry. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a 16-year-old junior, has started for Servite since he was a freshman. 
He has spent nearly every day in the pool -- including workouts on Christmas 
and New Year's Day -- for more than a year, and it was wrenching for him to 
think the season might end with him out of the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 And that seemed quite possible against Los Alamitos in the quarterfinals 
Wednesday. With Servite leading, 10-6, the Friars got the ball and Smith tried 
to break away on the counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
 Near mid-pool, Smith said, a Los Alamitos player grabbed his foot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to kick free," Smith said, "not to try and hurt him, just to try to 
get him off me. It wasn't blatant. If I kicked him in the face, it was 
completely accidental." 
</P>
<P>
 The referee saw it differently, awarding Los Alamitos a penalty shot and 
ejecting Smith from the game. Los Alamitos eventually tied the score, 10-10, 
before Servite scored the final five goals of the game to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite Coach Jim Sprague tried to appeal the major ejection on the grounds 
that it wasn't flagrant. But Sprague said he wasn't able to reach the referee, 
and without the referee an appeal couldn't be processed by the Southern 
Section. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprague said Smith isn't the type to retaliate. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can pound on him all day long, and you can cheap-shot him all day long 
and it doesn't bother him," Sprague said. "He's almost impervious to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Servite, the rest of the Friars were too much to handle. But 
now Sprague has to figure out how to get his team ready for top-seeded 
Esperanza, which beat the Friars, 11-9, in the regular-season finale. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprague, in his 26th season as a high school coach, watches hours of 
videotape, trying to find weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, he is spending more time psychoanalyzing his own team. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are able to pull this off, I'm going to be awarded honorary doctorates 
in psychology and psychiatry," Sprague said. "This team is the most bizarre 
thing I've ever experienced. The only thing is I'm better able to handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 With Smith, Brian Heifferon and Rob Mattivi, all members of the U.S. youth 
national team, Sprague frets his best players sometimes are more interested in 
their performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, the Friars are inconsistent. Before the season, Sprague hoped they 
would be able to challenge the best Division I teams, but they closed out the 
regular season with disappointing losses to Riverside Poly, Whittier La Serna 
and Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
 "People ask me how we're going to do, and I tell them I don't know who is 
going to show up," Sprague said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith agrees there is a problem and that the internal competition has been 
unhealthy for the team. Still, Smith said: "The season's not a disappointment, 
especially if we can come away with the championship." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a 6-foot-3 1/2, 200-pound two-meter man, could have a lot to do with 
that. Heifferon and Mattivi, both seniors, have scored 85 goals and 70 goals, 
Smith has 114 goals and 30 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprague marvels at Smith's offensive potential. "He goes on spurts that are 
just amazing," Sprague said. For instance, Smith scored 13 goals in a victory 
over North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake, a strong Division I team. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is an accurate shooter -- he has never missed a four-meter penalty shot 
in a high school game -- but Sprague believes Smith too often uses his skill to 
try to make a play look more spectacular than it needs to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a definite opinion how two-meter man should be played," Sprague said. 
"He violates an awful lot of my rules and I think that decreases his 
productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of painful to watch someone with so much talent who won't do the 
right thing. He might score but he doesn't always do it in the right fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, the youngest player to make a trip to Mexico City with the U.S. junior 
national team last May, hears and respects Sprague. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gives me more than a hard time," Smith said. "He just has such a different 
approach to the game that sometimes people, myself included for sure, would 
doubt him." 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt Sprague, who will be coaching in his 14th section title game 
Wednesday, will have the last word.

RANCHO SANTIAGO, FULLERTON IN BOWLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago, as expected and Fullerton, in a mild surprise, received bowl 
bids Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago, the champion of the Mission Conference Central Division, and 
Los Angeles Valley, both 9-1, have accepted invitations to meet in the Dec. 3 
Simple Green Orange County Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (6-3-1) plays Allan Hancock (7-3) also Dec. 3 in Santa Maria in the 
K-Swiss Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago won its final nine games after losing to El Camino in the 
opener. The Dons, the top-ranked team in Southern California, set a 
single-season record for points scored with 426. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago is fourth in the J.C. Grid-Wire national rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just such a special group of kids," Rancho Santiago Coach Dave Ogas 
said after his team ended the regular season Saturday with a 52-21 victory over 
Saddleback. "I'm happiest for them and the coaches. They all worked so hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Valley, ranked 16th by the J.C. Grid-Wire, ended the season with a 
42-0 victory over Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first bowl appearance for Rancho Santiago since the Dons beat 
Moorpark in the same game. This year's game starts at 1:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton finished second behind Rancho Santiago in the Central Division. The 
teams were tied at 4-0 when they met Nov. 12 but Rancho Santiago won, 34-7. 
Fullerton ended the regular season with a 54-42 victory over Southwestern. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's last bowl appearance came in 1991 when the Hornets beat Santa 
Barbara. Fullerton fell to 1-9 in 1992 then was 3-7 last season for first-year 
Coach Gene Murphy. STEVE KRESAL

FOOTNOTES / JAMES BATES: BROWN, BUT NOT OUT 
</P>

<P>
 Jerry Brown, who as governor once refused to move into the state mansion in 
lieu of a cheap apartment, is now having trouble getting anyone to move into 
his San Francisco home. 
</P>
<P>
 As was mentioned here recently, Brown is finding out firsthand how strong 
California's real estate market is by putting his Pacific Heights home -- a 
former fire station -- up for sale for $1.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out Brown so far has had only one bite: a $1.2-million offer that he's 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 His real estate agent, Florian Moore with McGuire Real Estate, said Brown is 
holding out for more, although he's open to offers. She said he's moving to a 
building he bought in Oakland that he is converting to an office and a home. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she has walked about 50 clients through the San Francisco home, which 
Brown bought for $1.2 million five years ago. He also spent additional money 
adding such things as bookshelves with a ladder. Economics 101 
</P>
<P>
 Who said public colleges were cheaper than private ones? 
</P>
<P>
 The November issue of the investment magazine Smart Money compares the costs 
of 19 miscellaneous purchases -- from framed diplomas to a mug with a logo on 
it -- at Notre Dame, the University of Pennsylvania and Williams College, as 
well as the University of Arizona and UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 The hands-down winner for most expensive items: Berkeley, which might explain 
the school's Golden Bear mascot. 
</P>
<P>
 A framed diploma at Berkeley runs $125, compared to $90 at Williams and $79.95 
at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 A simple transcript is $15 at Cal, compared to $2 at Notre Dame, $4 at Penn 
and free at Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 A reunion dinner is $200 per person at Cal, but only $25 at Williams, $40 at 
Notre Dame and $45 at Penn. 
</P>
<P>
 A hot dog at a sports event runs $3, compared to $1 at Williams and $1.75 at 
Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, there are college decals. At Berkeley, they run $2.50. None of the other 
schools sells them for more than $1. A Bushel of Yen 
</P>
<P>
 Sony Corp.'s $2.7-billion write-off on its Hollywood studio -- not to mention 
the $510-million operating loss -- has generated speculation that the studio is 
on the Road to Sellville, although Sony officials insist the Japanese company 
plans to keep it. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, how much is $2.7 billion? Some examples: 
</P>
<P>
 * It could buy 14 million to 300 million Sony Walkmans, depending on the 
model. 
</P>
<P>
 * From 3.9 million to 5.9 million Sony MiniDisc players, depending on the 
model. 
</P>
<P>
 * From 27 to 42 movies as expensive as the flop "Last Action Hero," depending 
on the budget you want to believe. Briefly. . .

 CIRCULAR HOOPS: College basketball is getting underway, and there is optimism 
at UC Irvine, where the men's team looks to a solid class of recruits to help 
it rebound from last season's 10-20 record. . . . But how will new and old 
Anteaters come together? Coach Rod Baker is hopeful based on his "informal 
sociological study" on team compatibility and its relationship to pre-practice 
stretching. "They're never told where to stretch, but if the players get in a 
circle, that's good," he says. "If you have guys off to the side, that's bad. 
So far, we've been pretty circular." 
</P>
<P>
 PYRAMID POWER: A new home will do wonders for self-esteem. Ask anyone at Long 
Beach State, where The Pyramid -- a $22-million, 5,000-seat facility for 
basketball and volleyball -- debuts Nov. 30 when the 49ers play University of 
Detroit Mercy in a nationally televised men's game. "Everybody is extremely 
excited," says Aimee Periolat, 49er women's player and graduate of Huntington 
Beach's Marina High. "People are going to come to see The Pyramid, and we all 
feel we can keep them coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 STAYING PUT: Nobody would have blamed Melody Earle for leaving Chapman 
University last year when the school eliminated her scholarship after it 
switched to an NCAA division that doesn't allow them. Earle, No. 4 scorer in 
school history, had suffered through a 2-22 season, and UC Riverside offered a 
full ride. But the Estancia graduate stayed put. "It was a comfort-zone thing," 
she says. Her loyalty may pay off: Chapman is expecting its first winning 
season since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 AGAINST ALL ODDS: Cal State Fullerton is last in the Big West Conference men's 
preseason coaches poll, but interim Coach Bob Hawking isn't dismayed. . . . 
"Knowing how many people most teams have returning, it didn't come as a big 
surprise," Hawking said. "We were picked last last year and ninth the year 
before, and we finished better than that both seasons. That's our goal, to 
finish higher than they think we will." Hawking hopes the Titans will do well 
enough to win him the job permanently.

 Jonuz Kasni and his family live in a domed object from which inhabitants might 
be expected to toddle out intoning, "Take me to your leader!" 
</P>
<P>
 What the Kasnis call home looks like an inverted concrete saucer with 
protruding metal loops of inscrutable function. Its front door is a narrow 
portal so low to the ground that even the younger children must duck to get in. 
</P>
<P>
 The sole window was not intended to take best advantage of the breathtaking 
view, but rather to grudgingly accommodate the snout of a tank gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Having despaired of the poverty and backwardness of their hometown in northern 
Albania, the Kasnis have taken up residence in one of the ubiquitous defense 
bunkers that stud this majestic landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 The 700,000 sheltered artillery emplacements -- dug into hillsides, shorelines 
and crossroads -- are unique to Albania and reveal the paranoia that consumed 
the late dictator Enver Hoxha during the 41 years he kept this European country 
in hermetic isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoxha built the structures after he cut his nation's ties with both East and 
West. He wanted them to be able to withstand an invasion by forces of either 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the bunkers are proving to be one of the most insurmountable legacies of 
the Stalinist era. 
</P>
<P>
 They are nearly indestructible and would cost a fortune to remove. 
</P>
<P>
 But the monuments to military madness are also inspiring ingenuity, like the 
comfortable, cost-free shelter Kasni has created for his transient family out 
of one of the larger versions of the concrete goose bumps. 
</P>
<P>
 In what may be Eastern Europe's biggest challenge in beating Communist-era 
swords into plowshares, Albanians and foreign aid workers are making a virtue 
of necessity by brainstorming ways of putting their bounty of bunkers to 
practical use. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers use them for chicken coops, keeping the birds inside by using woven 
twigs to block the gun sights and doorways. 
</P>
<P>
 Neophyte businessmen have converted well-located bunkers in Tirana, the 
capital, and the southern city of Gjirokaster into kiosks, burger bars, 
shoeshine stands, even discos. 
</P>
<P>
 One large tank bunker near the Greek-populated southern village of Goranxi has 
been topped with an Orthodox cross and will soon take in the faithful who were 
left without a place of worship after their village church burned down this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kasni, who has lived for nearly a year in his tank bunker on the eastern 
outskirts of Durres, a seaport on the Adriatic, shrugged off suggestions that 
his family of six was enduring undue hardship. "This is better than what we had 
in Peshkopi," the 45-year-old mechanic said of the crude mountain hut they had 
left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 He also insisted that his squatter's home compares favorably to much of the 
dilapidated housing in Albania's main cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Kasni has pirated electricity from the transmission lines that run along the 
nearby road, powering a huge television, a clock radio and a bare light bulb 
that hangs in the center of his yurt-like home. 
</P>
<P>
 Water is fetched from a creek running less than 100 yards from the bunker 
doorway. The contents of an outdoor privy are composted with garbage and leaves 
in a smaller bunker. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials won't say so for the record, but they concede privately 
that looking the other way at such illegal conversions has eased a catastrophic 
housing crisis brought on by too many disillusioned rural people on the move. 
</P>
<P>
 The bunkers belong to the government. The Defense Ministry built and has 
maintained them at a cost Albanian economists say would have financed the 
construction of an equivalent number of two-room apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Defense Ministry issued an edict last year forbidding willful 
destruction of the "strategic defensive positions," government officials say 
they have no idea what to do with the bunkers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Albania was a house with only one leak, it would be easy to find one 
umbrella," Leka Bungo, spokesman for the ruling Democratic Party, said of 
Albania's abundance of social and economic woes. "But this country is like a 
house with a roof that leaks everywhere, and it will take quite some time 
before we can get around to this bunker problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, the government would like to remove the bunkers and clear the 
physical and psychological impediments to investment and recovery, Bungo said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he acknowledged that excavating and extracting the millions of tons of 
concrete would be unimaginably expensive, even for a country much better off 
than impoverished Albania. 
</P>
<P>
 For the time being, he suggested, Albanians will have to abide the eyesores or 
make what practical use of them they can. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling that the former Communist regime kept a barber on duty round the 
clock at Tirana's airport on the off-chance that someone might try to enter the 
country wearing a legally forbidden beard, Bungo said Albanians have become 
accustomed to living in "a country of the absurd." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoxha ordered the bunkers -- one for every four Albanians -- sunk into every 
conceivable vantage point after the 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. An 
ideological zealot who emulated Soviet dictator Josef Stalin's most brutal 
tortures and repressions, Hoxha had already broken off relations with Moscow 
and every other Communist state, accusing their leaders of being unfaithful to 
totalitarian tenets. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoxha died in 1985, and the overthrow of communism elsewhere in Eastern Europe 
eventually spurred student revolts in Albania in 1990 and a fitful process of 
democratization that led to multi-party elections a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the bunkers' association with the past, not everyone is 
enthusiastic about the de facto decision to keep the relics of a regime that 
cut Albania off from the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Albanians would prefer that the steel-reinforced concrete pimples be 
removed from sight, whatever the cost, to eliminate the constant reminders of 
generations of repression. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should all be destroyed except for a few that should be used as museum 
pieces, to show future generations how the previous regime squandered millions 
. . . on something completely useless," said Angelushe Petani, owner of a 
private souvenir shop near Tirana's main Skanderbeg Square. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, daunted by the costs and complications of destruction, suggest that 
the bunkers instead undergo a psychological renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should paint them all," proposed Fatos Lubonja, a former political 
prisoner. "We should invite children, artists, foreigners, important people 
visiting from abroad, to change the message by painting them however they 
want." 
</P>
<P>
 The bunkers could be painted to look like flowers on the hillside, or 
sculpted, or wrapped in fabric, a la Christo, Lubonja said. 
</P>
<P>
 No government office has estimated the cost of digging up the bunkers. But 
foreign diplomats and casual observers note that the logistics alone defy 
contemplation. 
</P>
<P>
 What little antiquated excavation equipment has survived in the post-Communist 
chaos is put to better use in construction and mining, and the task of trucking 
away uprooted bunkers would overwhelm the country's limited hoists and rolling 
stock. Then there would be the issue of where to take 700,000 variously sized 
hunks of concrete, each weighing up to hundreds of tons. 
</P>
<P>
 Maura Schwartz, chief envoy to Albania of the American aid group Volunteers in 
Oversees Cooperative Assistance, has taken on the bunker burden with relish. In 
a campaign to compile "1,001 Uses for a Dead Bunker," Schwartz has dunned every 
Western diplomat, volunteer, missionary and potential investor for at least one 
idea before departure. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not allowed to leave the country without contributing," she recently 
cautioned two visiting American correspondents. (They came up with proposals to 
convert larger bunkers into automatic carwashes and smaller ones into wine 
cellars -- the latter suggestion proving highly unoriginal.) 
</P>
<P>
 Her idea bank covers an array of productive uses, from mushroom farms to 
marine breakwaters, crypts to camping shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 Other notions deposited with Schwartz include using the dank, dark structures 
for: 
</P>
<P>
 * Sealing up toxic chemicals, pending decisions about their disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cultivating worms. 
</P>
<P>
 * Showcasing the insane works of communism by sending one to every museum in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
 * Storing potatoes and root vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 * Housing prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keeping bees for honey. 
</P>
<P>
 * Selling fast food, including a new chain aiming to boast of "700,000 Bunker 
Burgers Served." 
</P>
<P>
 * Turning them upside down to use as goldfish ponds, barbecue pits and garden 
planters. 
</P>
<P>
 * Employing them, right side up, as pig-farrowing units, saunas or projection 
rooms for drive-in movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of the suggestions have been serious, like the proposals for dinosaur 
egg cups, heat-proof igloos for Alaska and giant juicers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some ideas, offered tongue-in-cheek, are actually in practice, like the ideas 
for using bunkers as outhouses or for taking advantage of their privacy for 
romantic trysts. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people had their first sexual experience in a bunker," observed a 
24-year-old Tirana woman. "We didn't have to wait for foreigners to suggest 
that."

NEW VILLAINS HAUNT VICTIMS OF BHOPAL DISASTER 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The late afternoon is sunny and pleasant, the breeze refreshing. Not like that 
night a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside a dark hovel, Safiya Khan, 55, lies inert on her unkempt cot. Her eyes 
are glassy, and she wheezes painfully. She paws at her left hand, swathed in 
rags to soothe the itching that began 10 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is on her deathbed," says husband Shahejed Khan. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a human symbol of the agony and misery still being caused by the 
greatest industrial disaster in history, this small, suffering woman with limp, 
tangled gray hair and fishlike eyes must be it. 
</P>
<P>
 The tiny storage shed where she lies dying is right by the seven-foot brick 
wall of Bhopal's Union Carbide plant. The venting tube that spewed a killer 
cloud of methyl isocyanate, or MIC, in December, 1984, is just 150 yards away. 
Nobody lives closer. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1989, Union Carbide Corp. and its Indian affiliate paid a 
settlement of $470 million to compensate victims of the tragedy that 
authorities say snuffed out 4,000 lives in its first days. Few would appear to 
have a better claim on the money than Safiya Khan and her husband, who reside 
on the grounds of an icehouse, where he works as the watchman. 
</P>
<P>
 But to this day, the moribund Safiya Khan receives only an interim 
compensation payment of 200 rupees, or $6, per month. "We're poor people; 
that's why they do this to us," mutters her 70-year-old husband, who wears a 
devout Muslim's white knit skullcap. "This is God's will." 
</P>
<P>
 Playwright Rajiv Saxena, whose "Story of the Gas Tragedy" has been staged all 
over India, is not as fatalistic. He is mulling over revising his script to 
make Indian officials, along with Union Carbide, the villains of the 
catastrophe. "At this point in time, the government is more guilty, because 
they have taken the money and haven't distributed it," Saxena charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Walk into the slums of J. P. Nagar across the road from the now-closed plant 
or other Bhopal shantytowns, talk to other accident victims, and more elements 
of this distressing mosaic emerge. In case after case, bureaucratic chicanery, 
fraud, corruption and callousness, conflicting political ambitions and most 
victims' illiteracy and ignorance have combined to make a sham of Indian 
officials' promises of generous compensation and free medical care for the 
Bhopal victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is only harassment for us in the courts," said Hazra Bii, 50, who was 
widowed by the accident. Since the 40 tons of MIC and other toxic gases gushed 
from the factory's No. 610 tank, one of her two adult sons has contracted 
incurable tuberculosis, the other psychological problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The courts demand all sorts of papers," the petite woman complained. "We have 
to spend a fortune on photocopying. And they keep putting off our hearing 
dates. They ask all sorts of questions that don't have anything to do with our 
case. How can we remember these things after 10 years?" 
</P>
<P>
 But in the past 10 months, officials of Madhya Pradesh state, of which Bhopal 
is the capital, have dramatically accelerated the settlement of claims. They 
now say they have cleared more than 100,000 compensation cases, compared with a 
total of only 9,000 as of a year ago. One recently processed file is Bii's, who 
is supposed to get a 25,000-rupee ($810) settlement this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Perversely, though, the most grievously injured victims, who consume a maximum 
of the magistrates' and government officials' time, are being bypassed for now 
-- intentionally. 
</P>
<P>
 Some disgusted Bhopalis say it's rank politicking by leaders of the Congress 
(I) Party, in power in this state and at the national level. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a political decision to please the majority -- the people who need 
the money the most aren't getting it," fumed Dr. D. K. Satpathy, director of 
the government's Medicolegal Institute here. "It's a sort of blackmail, and the 
poor are the victims." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the nearly half-billion-dollar settlement handed over by Union Carbide, 
$102 million has been paid out in claims, officials say. That sum is far less 
impressive when interest accumulated by the award kept in the vaults of the 
Reserve Bank of India is factored in. Government officials estimate the money 
has earned $48 million, while activists say it's more like $340 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "So what they've paid in claims is only a fraction of the interest they've 
made," charged Abdul Jabbar, an organizer of gas victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 15,969 death claims, only 6,650 had been accepted at last notice and a 
little less than $2 million paid out. Doubtless some claims were fraudulent or 
impossible to verify, because Bhopalis tend to blame the gas for just about 
every health problem. 
</P>
<P>
 But many bona fide claims cannot be proven because of the chaos that reigned 
after the gas leak, when civil authority ceased to exist and volunteer groups 
-- like drama clubs -- filled the vacuum by organizing medical relief and the 
cremation or disposal of the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our money, and they are harassing us when all we want is our due," 
Bii said. 
</P>
<P>
 C. S. Chadha, principal secretary in the state government's Bhopal tragedy 
relief department, says the Congress government that came to power here a year 
ago intends to settle all claims in the next two years. Activists, who have 
insisted on speedier compensation, say what is being implemented is a rip-off 
on a huge scale. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under pressure, including from us, they are adopting faster disposals of the 
cases," said Alok Pratab Singh, president of the Poisonous Gas Struggle 
Accident Front, one of several victims organizations. "But speed is not 
necessarily justice. The government of India's attitude now is to settle the 
claims for amounts that are insignificant and to save most of the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare Commissioner A. D. Qureshi has set 25,000 rupees as the minimum figure 
for compensation, and many gas victims, even those who complain of disabling 
lung injuries or other serious ailments, say they are being pressured to settle 
for that sum. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's almost arm-twisting, and it works, because these people are poor," 
reported N. K. Singh, a veteran Bhopal correspondent for India Today magazine. 
"If they appeal the award, they know they won't get their hands on the money 
until their case is decided and that they may lose the appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 Munibee Khan, 35, a mother of seven, suffers from stomach pains so severe she 
can't work or even eat normally. In 1990, she had a tumor removed. She lives a 
mile from the Union Carbide plant and breathed in so much MIC her respiratory 
tract felt, she recalled with a shudder, like it had been "filled with red 
chili peppers." 
</P>
<P>
 She has been offered the minimum compensation, she said, on condition she not 
appeal for more. "But it's not enough," the uneducated woman in a long black 
burkha, or Muslim robe, gently objected. "I feel I'm entitled to twice that." 
</P>
<P>
 To register their protests, members of the group she belongs to, the Bhopal 
Gas Affected Women's Industrial Organization, plan to storm the weed-choked 
grounds of the Union Carbide factory next month on the anniversary of the 
disaster and demolish the now-idle plant that once manufactured agricultural 
pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
 On its rubble, the women will lay stones inscribed with the names of the 
people who died in the lethal, choking pall 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 What transpired in this pleasant, lakeside city in the heart of the Indian 
subcontinent -- a place where more than 1.6 million people now reside -- is 
usually described, antiseptically, as "history's worst industrial accident." 
</P>
<P>
 Fran Pathak, a high school chemistry teacher, remembers the terror-filled 
hours with images that make a listener's flesh creep. 
</P>
<P>
 Around midnight on the night of Dec. 2-3, 1984, after a still-mysterious 
introduction of water into the No. 610 tank, the huge quantity of deadly gas 
spurted into the outside air. While people slept, the gas advanced like the 
plague in Cecil B. DeMille's "The Ten Commandments," Pathak said. Only it was 
milky white and not green. 
</P>
<P>
 More than twice as heavy as air, the vapor slipped silently under people's 
doors and through their windows. Some, like the Pathaks, it woke by giving 
their 6-year-old daughter coughing fits. Others, it asphyxiated as they 
slumbered. 
</P>
<P>
 Like more than 100,000 other Bhopalis, the Pathaks fled their home. Their eyes 
streamed with tears, their throats and insides burned as though they had been 
seared with a hot iron, and their noses ran. 
</P>
<P>
 As the white cloud stealthily advanced in the dead of night, people and 
animals collapsed and died on the city's roads, at the rail station, on the 
outdoor string beds where many of the poorest sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 So many succumbed that in the following days Satpathy performed a staggering 
3,000 autopsies -- so many that he thinks the bronchial asthma he developed may 
have been caused by MIC released when he sliced open cadavers. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims' blood, he says, was cherry-red: a sign that they had inhaled 
lethal cyanide. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, 639,000 personal injury claims have been filed demanding a share of 
Union Carbide's settlement money, which outraged activists still say was an 
inadequate pittance. Government officials estimate that more than half the 
claims are bogus, serving only to clog an already overburdened compensation 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you consider major to minor ailments, maybe 200,000 to 300,000 people were 
affected," Chadha said. 
</P>
<P>
 To sort out the validity of claims and fix the amount of compensation, 38 
special courts run by assistant commissioners have been created, as well as 
five appeals courts. For many functionaries, the scheme has been a gold mine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of each lakh (100,000 rupees, or $3,240) paid out, 20,000 to 30,000 goes back 
to the pockets of government officials," said Vimla Ghumarkar of the Gas 
Affected Women's Industrial Organization. "Assistant commissioners of relief, 
clerks, secretaries, doctors, magistrates -- they're all involved. If you want 
more than 25,000 rupees, you give bribes." 
</P>
<P>
 The pupils of beggar Mohammed Sheikh's brown eyes were turned a milky white by 
the gas as he slept outdoors a mile and a half from the Carbide plant. Now 
nearly blind, and illiterate and with no family members to help him, he was 
late in filing a damage claim. "So they (corrupt officials) want me to pay a 
bribe so I can have money," the 50-year-old pauper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, people who aren't entitled to compensation can obtain it -- for a 
kickback. Last June, a gang counterfeiting documents to support such phony 
claims was busted. In cahoots with employees in Qureshi's office and the 
special claims courts, the racketeers were charging cheaters 50% of their take. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials don't deny that graft and fraud are rife but say that's the way 
things are in India. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a final compensatory award is set, residents of 36 of Bhopal's 56 wards 
that have been officially designated "gas affected" receive the 200-rupee 
monthly interim payment, which is often their only means of support. 
</P>
<P>
 Some activists say that many recipients were unable to get their payment this 
autumn, further increasing the temptation to accept the minimum of 25,000 
rupees. 
</P>
<P>
 People designated "gas affected" are also supposed to get free medical care 
and drugs. But government efforts so far seem to have chiefly focused on 
building large hospitals; the major beneficiaries may not be ailing Bhopalis 
but Madhya Pradesh's construction industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Three times, Shahejed Khan has carried his sick wife from their corrugated 
shed on the icehouse grounds to a motorized rickshaw for a trip to a state 
hospital. He seethed when he recounted how she was treated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doctors put her in a dirty place," he said indignantly. "And they never 
gave her any medicines. They asked me to buy everything in a chemist's shop." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say new hospitals with 1,000 more beds for gas victims will be 
opened in the next two years. One new facility costing an estimated $21 million 
is supposed to be built by the Danbury, Conn.-based Union Carbide Corp., using 
the proceeds of its September agreement to sell off its controlling share in 
Union Carbide India Ltd., the Bhopal plant's owner and operator, to a Calcutta 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 In its interpretation of the gas leak's health consequences, Union Carbide 
cites a Madhya Pradesh government report mentioning 40 totally and permanently 
disabled people, 2,680 partially and permanently disabled people and almost 
19,000 people who were permanently injured but can still work. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide-ranging debate, however, still continues about the effects of the MIC 
discharge. 
</P>
<P>
 A 15-member team of foreign doctors who visited here in January estimated that 
10 to 15 survivors of the tragedy die every month after prolonged suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 Gas victims may suffer acutely from breathlessness, chest pain, diminished 
vision, muscular fatigue, hypertension and anxiety, chronic depression, 
menstrual irregularities, tuberculosis and other physical and mental ailments, 
the visiting physicians found. 
</P>
<P>
 Some who inhaled MIC now have a condition known as "chronic obstructed airways 
disease," doctors say. The substance that entered the lungs, a gas being used 
to manufacture a general-purpose pesticide, triggered an allergy-like response 
of the respiratory system and inflicted a debilitating condition akin to 
asthma. 
</P>
<P>
 As time goes by, even more health consequences may surface -- and on an 
unknown scale, physicians warn. "Everybody who was living in Bhopal was 
exposed," said Dr. B. S. Ohri of Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital, a facility built 
for those affected by the gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of today's compensation policy, like India Today's Singh, say that by 
processing the easiest cases first, the government may in effect be condemning 
the more seriously injured to death. "They need money now," Singh stressed. "If 
they don't get it, it will be of no use later. They may be dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Chadha replied that officials are moving as fast as they can. He also rejected 
as "absolute rubbish" allegations of bureaucratic pressure on victims to settle 
for the lowest award. "The cases are in the courts, and it's the courts, not 
the government, that decides what is fair," the member of the elite Indian 
Administrative Service said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the rusted gate to the Union Carbide plant stands locked, with angry 
graffiti like "Killer Carbide" scrawled on its pillars and barbed-wire-topped 
wall. Slum-dwellers from J. P. Nagar use the grass in front as an open-air 
latrine. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a single person has ever been tried for one of the greatest catastrophes 
in modern times, a fact that sickens activists and ordinary Bhopalis. "Forget 
the Carbide executives; what's happened to the person who gave the safety 
certification to the UCC plant without checking, our own people who cheated 
us?" Satpathy asked. "They should be hanged." 
</P>
<P>
 Every two weeks or so, a magistrate here convenes a hearing as an 
investigation drags on to identify and punish those responsible for "culpable 
homicide not amounting to murder" at Bhopal. The probe grew out of a 1991 
Supreme Court ruling overturning the quashing of possible criminal proceedings 
in return for Union Carbide's payment of $470 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. chemical giant blames the gas discharge on sabotage by a disgruntled 
employee. Whatever the truth, lawyers and reporters here expect nothing to 
result from the slow grinding of the wheels of Indian justice. Today, like that 
dreadful night 10 years ago, Bhopal's people are "helpless spectators" to what 
goes on in their city, activist attorney Vibhuit Jha said.

A NEW PUSH FOR HILLSIDE HOMES EMERGES; ECONOMY: CONFLICT OVER DEVELOPMENT IN 
SANTA MONICAS IS RENEWED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 From the air, they look like archeological digs of lost civilizations. 
</P>
<P>
 And perhaps they are -- wide, dusty swaths of the Santa Monica Mountains, 
where home developers of a different era, the late 1980s, built monuments to 
optimism by flattening ridges for tracts of ultra-expensive houses in the 
expectation that the Southland's real estate boom would go on forever. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't, and some speculators lost millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 But recently, with the recession ebbing, home prices firming and the state out 
of money to buy open space for parkland, a dozen development companies have 
made plans to create or finish major home projects in the Santa Monica 
Mountains between Griffith Park and Woodland Hills. Numerous individual 
property owners have joined in the land rush. 
</P>
<P>
 One developer wants to put 64 homes into the pristine woodlands surrounding 
Lake Hollywood. Another will set 30 condos in grasslands over the Hollywood 
Bowl. The developer of the Westside's ritziest mountain development expects to 
have 20 gigantic estates under construction by summer. And Merv Griffin just 
obtained city approval to subdivide a 157-acre mountaintop above Benedict 
Canyon into six immense home sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Reasons for the new push are demographic, generational and financial. In the 
same way that many middle-class home buyers have migrated to the Antelope 
Valley and Ventura County to escape Los Angeles' crime and crowding, wealthy 
residents of the Westside and Valley with young families are now moving higher 
into the Santa Monicas in search of the security of gated communities. In many 
instances, prices have fallen 50% from their 1989 peaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the last frontier" for major home construction in Los Angeles, said John 
C. Funk, an attorney who represents several builders. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rebound has disappointed and galvanized hillside homeowners who have 
withstood waves of development for five decades, and fret that their high rural 
enclaves will become just another gridlocked suburb. Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy officials, meanwhile, worry about the increasing danger to wildlife 
migration routes and to the scenery of the United States' only urban mountain 
range. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you bring all the congestion of the city to the hills, they won't be the 
resource and treasure they are now," lamented a recent newsletter of the 
Federation of Hillside & Canyon Assns. "The piecemeal destruction of these 
hills is at hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, homeowners and conservationists celebrated just two years ago 
when, after two decades of tortured consideration, the Los Angeles City Council 
adopted restrictions on development within a half mile of the 22-mile length of 
Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Declaring the twisting, 65-year-old street a "scenic parkway," the so-called 
specific plan prohibits the construction of homes on prominent ridges and 
imposes strict height, grading and density limits aimed at preserving the 
beauty of roadside vistas. Compliance is enforced by the city Planning 
Department under advisement of a design review board stacked with 
Mulholland-area residents and Conservancy officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The law went into effect amid the area's real estate depression, when little 
development was contemplated. Now, with renewed confidence in urban mountain 
real estate, builders are buying land cheaply in foreclosure and at federal 
Resolution Trust Corporation auctions, with tract and grading entitlements 
attached that predate the city's specific plan. Longtime owners, too, are 
following through with massive remodeling or subdivision plans -- some seeded 
by insurance money gained after the Northridge earthquake -- for which permits 
were granted before the restrictive ordinance took effect. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, for instance, major home builder J. M. Peters Co. bought a 174-lot 
Tarzana development called Mulholland Park at the southern end of Reseda 
Boulevard from Bank of America in foreclosure for $26 million. That was about 
65% off its estimated value of $72 million. Its previous owner was a Japanese 
partnership. Individual home prices will hover around $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The scope of such developments leaves veteran activist Alan Kishbaugh cold. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call them slums for the rich," said the president of the Federation of 
Hillside and Canyon Homeowners Assns. "I'll never understand why people with 
that much money want to live so close together." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason, said city Planning Director Con Howe, is laws aimed at 
minimizing grading. New Los Angeles ordinances governing hillside density 
encourage developers to pack homes into clusters surrounded by buffers of open 
space. That space is often sold or donated to the mountains conservancy for its 
crazy-quilt stretch of cross-mountain parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 The clustering effect makes it easy on makers of maps to the stars' homes, 
since much of the hillside land is selling to celebrities who prefer 
family-oriented private neighborhoods to individual gated estates in older 
communities with fuddy-duddy images, such as Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a six-mile stretch between Coldwater Canyon and the San Diego Freeway 
has become guard-gate row. Seven private communities have sprung up there in 
the past decade, and the newer ones are revving up sales of empty lots after 
withstanding the crash of the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 At Mulholland Estates, off Mulholland Drive near Beverly Glen, musician John 
Fogerty, actor Fred Dryer, singer Paula Abdul, actresses Vanna White and Loni 
Anderson and hockey star Wayne Gretzky live within shouting distance of each 
other in $2.5-million homes on mostly half-acre lots. 
</P>
<P>
 At Beverly Park, scarcely a mile east near Coldwater Canyon Avenue, athlete 
Magic Johnson, Walt Disney Co. chairman Michael D. Eisner, rocker Rod Stewart, 
six Indonesian businessmen, one Saudi prince and several of what the developer 
calls "regular Westsiders" -- such as California Pizza Kitchen co-founder Larry 
Flax -- own much bigger estates or lots. Homes still range in price up to $10 
million, but developer Brian Adler said that two-acre lots once going for $4.5 
million can now be had for $2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Such "bargain" pricing seems to work. A majority of the 64 two-acre lots Adler 
graded at the market's peak have lain vacant for four years. But he claims 
sales of one a month, and said construction will begin on 20 homes by summer. 
</P>
<P>
 What's life like behind the Wrought-Iron Curtain? 
</P>
<P>
 The wide streets of steeply sloping Mulholland Estates are lined with mature 
camphor trees to provide the illusion of a neighborhood that's been growing for 
20 years, instead of six. One resident said neighbors pride themselves on 
friendly block parties, and on efforts to avoid raising "hoity-toity Westside 
kids." Although they technically lie in Sherman Oaks, their homes get 
prestigious (some say pretentious) 90210 ZIP codes because a Beverly Hills 
postal carrier covers that stretch of Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The community clearly is expanding, if slowly. Vast empty lots do lie like 
forgotten playing cards among grand mansions built wall to wall. But most 
streets today teem with contractors' trucks, and the air rattles with the sound 
of sand-blasters. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction noise is sweet music to Kenneth Chang, one of three 
Mulholland Estates developers. The architect recently stood in a light rain 
outside his spartan office and declared that the final 20% of his 96-lot 
community would be built out over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pace of sale has gotten regular and steady -- the best thing for the real 
estate market," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A double rainbow from the waning storm framed Chang as he spoke, as if to 
symbolize the concerns that arc over such developments: Property owners feel 
entitled to earn a pot of gold from their hillside investments, while longtime 
nearby homeowners and conservationists think that the mountains themselves are 
the gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why his community has such an unusually wide view of the San Fernando 
Valley, for instance, Chang proudly pointed out that he had sliced the 
property's central ridge by 70 feet and used that 1 million cubic yards of dirt 
to fill in and flatten an adjacent canyon. That grading led to the creation of 
flat streets in the otherwise rugged terrain, where Gretzky's sons now tutor 
Chang's boys and others in roller hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 It's this view of land management that galls the homeowner groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate that development -- they raped the mountains," Kishbaugh says of 
Mulholland Estates. "People used to build their homes low and let them ramble. 
Now you've got people who have this big-box mentality and feel this need to 
build out to the edge of their lots. What's worth saving is the open space. I'm 
interested in the shape of the contours of the mountains, not how it can be cut 
by a bulldozer." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, though, the homeowners' battle against the ridgeline communities is 
over. The developers are now merely elbowing each other to draw new customers 
to lots that have sat idle for up to five years. More infuriating to area 
residents are whole projects that were graded but abandoned when the market 
soured. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Herman owns one such bedeviled development. A leading Beverly Hills real 
estate agent, he bought 99 acres on a handsome mountain near Franklin Canyon a 
decade ago and obtained city approval to scrape off 1 million cubic yards of 
dirt for 13 huge lots. So far, he has shoved 600,000 cubic yards off the 
mountain. But he's run out of money; he needs $8 million to finish the job. 
</P>
<P>
 So his chopped-off mountaintop sits, yellow and sad amid the rolling green 
hills, with mammoth, mute ground-moving tractors resting there -- the ugly bane 
of drivers gazing west as they descend Coldwater Canyon Avenue south toward 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll admit it disturbs me. I'm an environmentalist," says Herman, who has 
listed the property for sale at $16.75 million. "This is the only subdivision 
I've done in my life, and maybe I'm not expert enough. Maybe I'm in over my 
head and need someone to help me." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners have encouraged city planners to force developers to put up a 
completion bond before grading, guaranteeing that they will not leave the hills 
scarred if a project is abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, builders have turned back the proposal -- and it would not help with 
well-financed builders, who can afford to rip down a mountain and leave it 
fallow until the market turns. 
</P>
<P>
 The sons of hotel tycoon Barron Hilton did that in a Mandeville Canyon 
development called Brentwood Country Estates. In October, they sold the first 
of 13 lots that were graded in 1991 and have lain stripped in full public view 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 Merv Griffin inadvertently turned out to be another property owner left 
holding a major piece of graded land during the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, the entertainment mogul bought a 157-acre mountain in Benedict Canyon 
for $5 million from the sister of the late Shah of Iran. He intended to erect a 
58,000-square-foot mansion that would give him the largest and highest home in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Griffin sliced more than 1 million cubic yards of dirt off the hill 
to create a 14-acre flat pad with room for four lakes, a four-lane driveway and 
a garage big enough for 60 limousines. But before launching construction, he 
bought the Beverly Hilton Hotel and changed his mind, according to his realtor, 
Steve Lewis of Jon Douglas Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the mountain has sat, bald and baleful, 136 feet lower than 
intended by nature -- though high enough so its scar can only be seen from the 
air. Griffin, who will donate 70% of the hillside to the Conservancy for 
parkland, recently obtained city permission to subdivide the property into six 
lots and is about to put whole thing on the market for $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
 It might be the last of its kind for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many ridges have been compromised that no more should be cut from now on," 
said Ralph Avila, a city associate planner who has been responsible for 
enforcing the Mulholland specific plan. "It's important to preserve what we 
have left." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two men with the clearest view of the home-building curve are the 
Conservancy's critters-and-cash duo: ecologist Paul Edelman and parkland 
acquisitions chief John Diaz. Although the Conservancy spent its last dollar on 
the Canyon Oaks development near Topanga Canyon in March, and voters' rejection 
of Proposition 180 in June left it unable to make any large purchases until at 
least 1997, Edelman and Diaz sit at Conservancy headquarters high above Malibu 
and plot ways to acquire new open space by cajoling, shaming and wheedling it 
from private owners or richer public agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of their hit list is the Lake Hollywood project. Jefferson 
Development controls 174 acres in a grassy bowl above the city reservoir there. 
In the face of virulent local opposition, it filed a draft Environmental Impact 
Report two years ago that called for scraping 1.7 million cubic yards of dirt 
off pristine ridgelines and dumping it in an adjacent canyon to create 64 
spacious guard-gated home sites and a long road to reach them. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman, a UC Santa Cruz-trained biologist, covets the land, calling it the 
"Griffith Park Connector." He contends that deer and other mammals cross it to 
reinvigorate their gene pool in the little remaining open space between the 
Hollywood and San Diego freeways. The Conservancy has teamed up with the Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power in an attempt to buy two-thirds of the 
land from Jefferson, but its finances make the effort quixotic at best. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be the key development battle of the year if they proceed," said 
Diaz. Jefferson officials declined to comment on their plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Also high on the Conservancy's list is a 240-acre tract of highlands between 
Mandeville and Sullivan canyons in Brentwood, owned by a partnership of 
Coscan-Davidson Homes and Los Angeles auto dealer Herbert F. Boeckmann. 
</P>
<P>
 Coscan executive Andrew Oliver expressed frustration at his firm's inability 
to develop the property into a gated community of 34 one-acre lots priced at 
over $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Homeowner groups and politicians have absolutely decimated property rights 
with environmental laws," declared Oliver. 
</P>
<P>
 Coscan will finalize its environmental impact report with the city Planning 
Department by January; a draft circulated six months ago included plans for an 
unusual corkscrew tunnel up through a mountain to the property from Mandeville 
Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman and Diaz would desperately like to buy the Coscan land as a southern 
gateway to public trails in the "Big Wild" -- the 18,000 acres of state-owned 
terrain between the San Diego Freeway and Pacific Coast Highway. A fire road 
framing the property, in fact, has been a popular route for hikers and mountain 
bikers, including Mayor Richard Riordan, for six decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Emotions run high in the scenic canyon. Attorney Eric F. Edmunds, who 
coordinates local opposition to the project, condemns Coscan's strategy as a 
"total speculation play." 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the whole thing has been an effort to drive up the price they'd get 
from the Conservancy," Edmunds said. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Oliver calls the Big Wild "the product of someone's 
imagination." But he said Coscan would indeed sell if the Conservancy can 
scrape together the money. Since that's unlikely, he said, Coscan hopes to have 
its EIR approved in January and homes under construction by April, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the rest of the city care? 
</P>
<P>
 Louise Frankel, a longtime homeowner activist in Tarzana, believes the 
give-and-take between builders, the city and the Conservancy usually yields a 
promising compromise. She battled throughout the 1970s and '80s to keep Gulf 
America and others from developing 2,000 acres in the Big Wild triangle between 
Brentwood, Tarzana and Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the good of future generations and the city," she said, "it is not 
selfish to suggest that some of these lands should not be developed. People use 
them every day for hiking and biking and for just being at peace. This is 
important for the human soul." Million-Dollar Mountains 
</P>
<P>
 With the recession ebbing, home prices firming and the state out of money to 
buy open space for parkland, a dozen; development companies and numerous 
individual property owners have made plans to create or finish major home 
projects in the Santa Monica Mountains between Griffith Park and Woodland 
Hills.

NOVEL FREEZING SURGERY USED ON PANCREAS CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Surgeons at Century City Hospital have for the first time used cryosurgery to 
treat pancreas tumors, a painful, intractable form of cancer that is almost 
universally fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 The innovative technique of killing tumor cells by freezing them to minus 300 
degrees Fahrenheit is increasingly used on liver and prostate cancers, but had 
not been applied to the pancreas because of technical difficulties in the 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Kenneth P. Ramming and his colleagues at the John Wayne Cancer Institute 
have spent two years working on dogs and cadavers to develop surgical 
techniques that allow it to be used on the pancreas, and the cryosurgery offers 
a first hope for prolonging the lives of victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Pancreas cancer strikes 27,000 Americans each year, killing 25,900. Only 3% of 
patients now survive five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramming's second patient, operated on Tuesday, is Erwin Muskatt, a 58-year-old 
businessman from New York City. Muskatt was moved out of the intensive care 
unit Saturday and hopes to be released from the hospital next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a conversation Sunday, Muskatt was optimistic about his prospects but 
discounted his pioneering role. "Being a pioneer doesn't matter," he said. 
"Being alive is good." 
</P>
<P>
 The first patient was a 65-year-old Santa Barbara housewife who underwent the 
procedure late last month. She has required a subsequent surgery to halt 
gastrointestinal bleeding not directly related to the cryosurgery but is now 
doing well, Ramming said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramming is optimistic about both patients' prospects for long-term survival. 
One key predictor is the housewife's level of a blood tumor marker called 
CA19-9, which is specific for pancreas cancer. In a healthy person, the level 
is not usually above 37 units. "When we operated, her value was 9,650 units. . 
. . Two weeks later, it was under 100. Now it's normal. That's a spectacular 
result," Ramming said. "That's pretty objective evidence that the cancer is 
dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Further evidence came when he re-operated to repair the gastrointestinal 
bleeding, Ramming said. "When we looked back in there (at the pancreas), we 
didn't see anything. It looked like the pancreas had melted away." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of freezing tumors to kill them has been around for half a century, 
but only within the past few years has the technology become available to 
implement surgeons' visions. Newly devised coolers, costing upward of $200,000, 
pump liquid nitrogen through thin probes inserted into the tumor by surgeons 
using ultrasound as a guide. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapid cooling available with these probes can freeze a large tumor down to 
minus 300 degrees in just a few minutes. When liquid inside the cells freezes, 
sharp ice crystals form, rupturing cellular membranes and completely disrupting 
metabolic processes. When the tumor thaws out, Ramming said, it is a gray mush 
that is generally resorbed by the body. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that cryosurgery kills cancer," he said. "The only 
limiting factor is our creativity in applying it." 
</P>
<P>
 The technique is most commonly used for cancers of the liver and prostate, in 
large part because conventional surgery is very difficult. That is due to the 
fact that both organs are suffused with blood vessels that produce bleeding, 
impeding vision in conventional surgery and increasing the chances of damage to 
crucial nerves and blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramming and Dr. Wilson S. Wong of Alhambra Hospital have been the foremost 
proponents of cryosurgery in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramming has performed the procedure on 120 liver cancer patients and 55 
prostate patients. Like other researchers, he has no long-term figures for 
survival, however, because the first patients were operated on little more than 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pancreas, which secretes powerful digestive enzymes that aid the 
body's breakdown of food, is a special case. Advanced tumors are not often 
susceptible to conventional surgery because usually, by the time a tumor is 
detected, it has invaded surrounding structures, particularly crucial blood 
vessels. 
</P>
<P>
 While cryosurgery can kill the tumor cells without damaging the blood vessels, 
if the tumor is simply frozen in place the enzymes leak and eat the pancreas 
itself, producing lethal pancreatitis. 
</P>
<P>
 Working in dogs, Ramming's team devised ways to seal the tumor from the rest 
of the pancreas, sewing partitions through the organ so that enzymes could not 
leak when the tumor was killed. They had to provide artificial ducts so that 
the enzymes they had sealed off could still be released into the stomach or 
intestine. 
</P>
<P>
 They also had to partition off a portion of the duodenum -- the intestine -- 
so that they could insert the liquid nitrogen probe through it into the hidden 
pancreas. 
</P>
<P>
 When the procedure successfully destroyed pancreas tumors in dogs, they 
learned how to scale up the operation by performing the procedure on cadavers. 
"Surgeons don't like to see a dead body on the operating table," he said, "but 
without the practice, our first operations wouldn't have gone nearly as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Muskatt was referred to Ramming by his friend Sue Neuman, a volunteer at John 
Wayne who knew Ramming had developed the new procedure. Muskatt had been having 
stomach problems and severe pain since February, but was not diagnosed as 
having pancreas cancer until June. Laparoscopic surgery showed that the tumor 
was advanced and not "locally resectable" -- the language physicians generally 
use to say it's inoperable. 
</P>
<P>
 Radiation and chemotherapy temporarily reduced the disabling pain but did 
nothing to shrink the tumor. That was when he heard about Ramming. Electing to 
fly to Los Angeles for treatment seemed logical, his wife Roberta said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not much of a decision. Since anything else is less than desirable -- 
they're not cures -- this was the obvious choice because it was a chance to get 
rid of the tumor entirely. We were very happy to take it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Muskatt and the unnamed housewife can only wait to see how well they 
recover. Because of the relentlessly progressive nature of pancreas cancer, "it 
won't take too long to see how well it is working," Ramming said. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Ramming plans to operate on an average of one pancreas patient a 
week until the team has accumulated 50 cases. Then they will take a little time 
to assess their results and see if their optimism is justified.

NEWS ANALYSIS; ECONOMIC FIGHTS LIKELY TO EXPOSE RIFTS IN GOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid the public displays of post-election euphoria and unity, the Republicans 
who will assume control of Congress in January are quietly positioning 
themselves for what they expect to be a bitter intraparty battle over tax and 
budget policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic policy dispute pits moderate Senate Republicans against more 
ideologically conservative House GOP leaders and seems certain to reveal deep 
divisions within the party that had appeared to have been closed by this 
month's electoral triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome could determine the success or failure of the Republican campaign 
to turn Congress into a weapon capable of bludgeoning Washington into accepting 
radical change. 
</P>
<P>
 The new House leaders, led by incoming Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia, are 
interpreting their electoral sweep as a mandate for a reversal of President 
Clinton's economic policies and a return to Republican supply-side theory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gingrich camp, energized by its success at gaining control of the House 
for the first time in 40 years, so far has managed to frame the terms of the 
economic policy debate with its "contract with America." The sweeping agenda 
calls for tax cuts for corporations and individuals, increased outlays for 
defense, reduced spending on welfare and other domestic programs and a 
balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution. Incoming House Majority Leader 
Dick Armey (R-Tex.), who shares Gingrich's zeal for supply-side theory, says he 
views the Republican strategy on taxes as an effort to launch a "frontal 
assault on big government." 
</P>
<P>
 The contract also calls for congressional term limits, tougher federal 
criminal-sentencing laws and a ban on placing U.S. troops under United Nations 
command. But at heart, it is a conservative economic manifesto, a loud 
restatement of Reaganomics. 
</P>
<P>
 The volume might turn out to be a little too much for Senate Republicans. 
Generally far less ideological than their House counterparts, some GOP senators 
say they find the budgetary and economic arithmetic behind the contract 
frightful. 
</P>
<P>
 Many agree with the Clinton Administration's assessment that the contract's 
mix of tax cuts and new defense spending would cause the federal budget deficit 
to balloon, largely because many of the offsetting spending cuts laid out in 
the contract would be nearly impossible to pass through both the House and 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the proposal for a balanced budget amendment would force far 
deeper cuts, putting Republicans into a fiscal straitjacket for the remainder 
of the century. The conflicting signals on budget and tax policy could prompt 
the Federal Reserve to again raise interest rates, slowing the economy and 
widening the deficit even more. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big issue that will very quickly confront the House Republicans is that 
if they want these big tax cuts, they are going to have to pay for them. If 
this contract is perceived as worsening the deficit, that will drive interest 
rates up, and that would negate any economic stimulus you might get from 
cutting taxes," said Barry Bosworth, an economist and budget analyst at the 
Brookings Institution think tank in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with that kind of scenario, Senate moderates are likely to force House 
Republicans to set priorities. Because they can't do everything in their 
contract at once without courting fiscal disaster, the argument goes, they will 
have to choose which elements they want the most. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the critical choices that could confront House Republicans, one is 
paramount: If push comes to shove, do conservative Republicans want an 
expensive capital gains tax cut for corporate America more than they want an 
even more costly tax reduction for millions of middle-class families? 
</P>
<P>
 A 50% reduction in the tax on profits from stocks, bonds and other 
investments, would cost the government an estimated $56 billion over five 
years. The second, a $500-per-child tax credit for families, carries a whopping 
$107-billion price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility that the Gingrich camp will be forced to choose one or the 
other, but not both, could set the stage for a bitter battle between 
traditional, pro-business Republicans and a new generation of pro-family 
Republicans over how best to solidify the party's new political dominance. Some 
observers are already warning that if the party reverts to classic conservative 
economic policy favoring wealthy individuals and business interests -- without 
providing significant tax relief to the middle class -- its lease on Capitol 
Hill could be short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that if it comes down to a choice, Republicans should recognize that 
they have to go for a pro-family agenda if they want to take advantage of the 
opportunity they now have to become a majority party with broad-based appeal," 
said Bob Morrison, a spokesman for the Family Research Council, a lobbying 
group promoting Christian family-oriented values. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet House Republican leaders are clearly more enthusiastic about a capital 
gains tax cut than they are about middle-class tax relief. Supply-side 
conservatives don't believe middle-class tax cuts produce any lasting economic 
benefits, while capital gains tax reductions are thought to cause more money to 
flow into productive investments over the long term. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Bill Archer (R-Tex.), the likely new chairman of the House Ways and Means 
Committee, said in an interview that he is committed to pushing a capital gains 
tax cut through his committee no matter what, but he wants to wait and see 
whether money is available to finance a middle-class tax cut. The 
Administration seems to sense that such sentiments could undermine support for 
the Republicans. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen sent a strong signal Friday 
that the White House wants to propose a broad-based middle-class tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly, members of the incoming House leadership have refused to acknowledge 
that they could be forced to make such choices. "There is a consensus on fiscal 
policy in the party. We will pass the contract in the House, and then it will 
only take about a three-hour conference committee (between House and Senate 
leaders) to iron out the details," insisted one GOP House aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Such optimism tends to disregard political and economic realities that will 
soon confront House conservatives. If not handled deftly, they could stall the 
conservative revolution almost before it can get started. "The House and Senate 
Republicans are not harmonious on these issues; you can already see the splits 
coming," political analyst Kevin Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 Incoming Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) was so leery of the contract 
and its budgetary impact that he and other leading Senate Republicans refused 
to endorse it during the fall campaign. Since the election, Dole has signaled 
that he does not feel committed to accepting the contract as the basis for 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole is hardly alone. Virtually every key Senate committee dealing with 
economic policy will be chaired next year by GOP moderates with little apparent 
interest in an ideological revolution: Bob Packwood of Oregon on the 
tax-writing Finance Committee, New Mexico's Pete V. Domenici on the Budget 
Committee and Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon on the Appropriations Committee. There 
is not a supply-sider among them. 
</P>
<P>
 Packwood, Domenici and Hatfield are likely to oppose efforts by House 
conservatives to slash welfare and other anti-poverty programs to help finance 
tax cuts for the rich and the middle class. The House contract calls for saving 
at least $40 billion over five years through cuts in welfare-related programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Senate Agriculture Committee, which will play an important role in 
1995 during the five-year reauthorization of the farm bill, will be chaired by 
a Republican moderate. Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.) is considered unlikely to 
brook House efforts to gut farm programs to pay for a conservative agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating matters further are the personalities and ambitions of the new 
congressional leaders, a group that includes several rivals for the Republican 
presidential nomination in 1996. Dole, a likely candidate, could feel compelled 
to appear more conservative on economic issues to protect himself from attacks 
from the right by rival presidential aspirant Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Dole and Gingrich have never cared much for each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole recalled after the election how Gingrich once dismissed him as the "tax 
collector for the welfare state," meaning he was so concerned about budget 
deficits that he would agree to increase taxes to support new Democratic social 
programs. "Since then, Gingrich has said I'm maturing, so I guess now he thinks 
I'm a mature tax collector for the welfare state," Dole quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 More fundamentally, Senate Republicans fear that the supply-side theories of 
the House Republican leadership could blind the conservative wing of the party 
to the need to deal with the economic problems that have generated so much 
anger and frustration among voters: stagnating wages and an eroding 
middle-class way of life. Many believe that the choices the party makes on tax 
policy in coming weeks could help determine whether it seizes an opportunity to 
establish itself as the party of the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 "These conservatives are misinterpreting what is wrong with the economy," one 
Republican said. "We have an economy where unemployment is low, inflation is 
low, but people are still angry. And that means something has changed, and we 
have to come up with new answers, not just return to old issues like a capital 
gains tax cut."

NEWS ANALYSIS; ARAFAT FORCED TO SHIFT FOCUS, PACIFY MILITANTS; MIDEAST: PLO 
CHAIRMAN ORDERS RELEASE OF SOME JAILED PALESTINIAN LEADERS. MOVE IS LIKELY TO 
ANGER ISRAELIS. 
</P>

<P>
 The bloody clash between Palestinian police and Islamic militants in Gaza last 
week has forced Yasser Arafat to shift his attention from peacemaking with 
Israel to peacemaking with the Palestinian opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat, head of the Palestinian self-governing authority, on Sunday ordered 
the release of some leaders of the militant Islamic Jihad movement from 
Palestinian jails. The releases appeared to be a conciliatory gesture meant to 
help defuse tensions between the Palestinian Authority and the movement. 
</P>
<P>
 They are likely to infuriate Israeli officials, who have warned Arafat that 
his failure to quell attacks on Israelis by Islamic Jihad and another Islamic 
organization, Hamas, is jeopardizing the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has said that Arafat must choose between 
peace with Israel and peace with the Islamic militants. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Arafat, the choice is not nearly so clear-cut. He is exercising 
limited authority, with a puny budget, in Gaza, where Hamas and Islamic Jihad 
enjoy their greatest popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Palestinians who do not agree with the tactics of the Islamic militants 
nonetheless sympathize with their opposition to the Israeli-Palestinian accords 
and respect their strict adherence to Islam. Palestinians also fear that any 
crackdown on the Islamic militants might lead to civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Friday, when Palestinian police shot dead at least 13 people -- 
unofficial Palestinian sources said 18 died -- and wounded at least 129 more in 
running gun battles with militants, Arafat had carefully refrained from any 
armed confrontation with Islamic Jihad or Hamas. He still appears to be more 
interested in politically co-opting them than in crushing them. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat's decision to start releasing Islamic Jihad leaders came after 
Palestinian mediators worked out a truce Friday night between the Palestinian 
police and the militants. The mediators are now trying to extend that truce and 
to fashion a broader political accord between Arafat's government and the 
militants. 
</P>
<P>
 The fundamentalists made the release of prisoners one of their conditions of 
reconciliation with the Palestinian Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Tension between the Palestinian Authority and Islamic militants had been 
mounting for weeks, with the militants staging a series of deadly attacks on 
Israelis and vowing to torpedo the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, Palestinian police arrested about 120 Islamic Jihad members after 
a suicide bomber from the group blew himself up at an Israeli checkpoint near 
the Jewish settlement of Netzarim in Gaza, killing three Israeli soldiers. No 
one has been charged in that attack. Palestinian police arrested 300 more 
Islamic activists in Gaza on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problem facing Arafat is that the Islamic militants consider their 
attacks against Israelis a sacred mission that they will continue despite any 
reconciliation with the Palestinian Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night, another Israeli soldier -- 26-year-old reserve Sgt. Gil Dadon 
-- was killed in a drive-by shooting at the Netzarim checkpoint. Israel again 
demanded that the Palestinian Authority apprehend the attackers, and it beefed 
up its presence around settlements in Gaza and throughout the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all now facing a crossroads," said Joel Singer, the Foreign Ministry's 
legal adviser and one of the drafters of the Israeli-Palestinian peace 
framework. "This junction we are at with the Palestinians may lead us down the 
drain or facilitate the beginning of our climbing toward a more stable peace." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview at his office Sunday, Singer repeatedly accused the 
Palestinian Authority of violating its agreements with Israel. Most dangerous 
to the process, Singer said, is the Palestinian Authority's inability to curb 
attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arafat and the PLO promised us that they would take control in Gaza and that 
they would disarm the armed bands. They have not done that," said Singer, a key 
player in Israel's ongoing negotiations with the Palestinians over extending 
self-rule throughout the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the common Israeli, everything else is much less significant than the 
security situation. The Palestinian Authority must take control of the security 
situation," Singer said. "Maybe we are reaching a point where the whole thing 
will collapse because the process will lose the support of the two sides." 
</P>
<P>
 But Arafat is under pressure from Palestinians to stop rounding up Islamic 
militants every time Israelis are attacked. That pressure is bound to increase 
after Friday's clashes, which many Palestinians blamed on the Palestinian 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody can violently suppress these demonstrations by the Islamists without 
becoming some sort of dictatorial rule," said Ziad abu Amr, a political science 
professor at Birzeit University in the West Bank.

DOLE LINKS GATT HELP TO TAX CUT; POLITICS: INCOMING SENATE GOP LEADER WANTS THE 
WHITE HOUSE TO SUPPORT A CAPITAL GAINS BREAK. PANETTA CALLS SUCH AN EXCHANGE 
FOR BACKING THE GLOBAL TRADE PACT UNLIKELY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Incoming Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole suggested Sunday that he would be 
more inclined to support the Clinton Administration's effort to ratify a world 
trade pact if the White House endorses the longtime Republican goal of reducing 
the capital gains tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole (R-Kan.), appearing on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley," said he 
had raised the prospect of such a deal in a meeting Saturday with White House 
Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta responded later Sunday that Dole wasn't likely "to get a commitment 
from us that we're going to suddenly support a capital gains tax cut," 
particularly in connection with the trade agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing on CNN's "Late Edition," Panetta said the Administration was 
nevertheless "making good progress" in its bid to win Dole's support for the 
global accord negotiated under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Sunday, Dole, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), who is expected to be 
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and three prominent Republican governors 
said in TV appearances that the incoming GOP House and Senate majorities should 
make tax and budget cuts their priority rather than seeking a controversial 
constitutional amendment to put prayer back in public schools. This appeared to 
be a rebuke to incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who pledged to 
bring a prayer proposal to a vote by July 4. 
</P>
<P>
 The GATT accord is a major immediate hurdle for the beleaguered 
Administration, which is seeking bipartisan support for the agreement. 
President Clinton, cutting short his Hawaii vacation by half a day, returned to 
Washington on Sunday to work for passage of the pact. The toughest fight 
appears to loom in the Senate, where Sens. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) and 
Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) lead the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration sources privately expressed confidence Sunday that they will 
have the votes to steer the massive trade accord through the House and Senate. 
But support from Dole appears to be crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole said he favors the concept of the expanded trade agreement but has 
specific concerns. Nonetheless, he added, "we're getting close to an 
agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he acknowledged that he had suggested to Bentsen that he 
wanted the Treasury secretary's commitment to cutting capital gains taxes 
before he agreed to back the GATT accord. A Bentsen aide said Dole had not 
found a receptive audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the secretary's understanding, the two are not linked," said 
Bentsen spokeswoman Joan Logue-Kinder. "He told him we would look at all tax 
considerations on the table and that whatever we did (in terms of tax 
reduction) would have to be paid for." 
</P>
<P>
 She added that any debate on tax cuts is expected to come well after the GATT 
vote, which is scheduled for a special session of Congress next week. Panetta 
said the Administration has opposed previous initiatives to reduce capital 
gains taxes because such proposals favor the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans have long sought to lower taxes on the profits from stocks, bonds, 
real estate and other investments. They maintain that such cuts would spur 
economic growth and create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade agreement, negotiated by 123 nations, would cut tariffs on 
manufactured goods by an average of 40% around the world and extend copyright 
and other protections to everything from the production of pharmaceuticals to 
musical recordings. It would also pave the way for banks, insurance companies 
and other financial service firms to operate in foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole said his major concern was the creation of a World Trade Organization as 
a successor to GATT, which now governs world commerce. The new organization 
would mediate trade disputes among members, and members would be bound by its 
decisions. Some critics of the accord say that it would erode the sovereignty 
of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole said that during his meeting with Administration officials, "I proposed a 
way to get out of the World Trade Organization if we have these arbitrary and 
capricious adverse decisions coming from this secret panel." 
</P>
<P>
 But Logue-Kinder countered that the United States has had similar arrangements 
under GATT and other bilateral agreements without the adverse effects predicted 
by GATT opponents. She said that because the United States already has 
relatively open markets, in most instances where there has been some kind of 
arbitration it is the United States that has invoked the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Rep. Bill Archer (R-Tex.), who is expected to be chairman of the 
tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said earlier on the ABC program 
that he favored a capital gains tax rate "somewhere between 15% and 20%." The 
current rate is 28%. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic reform was also on the minds of three Republican governors who agreed 
Sunday that the new GOP congressional leadership will be on more solid footing 
with voters if it pushes to trim spending rather than pursue a mandate for 
school prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief executives, all considered moderates on social issues, appeared on 
NBC-TV's "Meet the Press." 
</P>
<P>
 "The new Republican Congress needs to be very disciplined and very focused on 
issues that really affect people very much in their daily lives," said 
California Gov. Pete Wilson, whose concern was shared by Gov. Christine Todd 
Whitman of New Jersey and Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatch, who is among the Senate's most conservative members, said that he also 
"would prefer to solve the economic problems first." He added that he doesn't 
"believe the votes are there for a vocal school prayer amendment, but they are 
there for a silent prayer or reflection amendment." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the prayer proposal, Dole also said he wanted Republicans "to 
engage in some other issues up front. . . . If we're going to bring about 
change, we better bring up measures we can pass so the American people will get 
the message that we're serious." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole also differed with Helms, the incoming chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee, who earlier in the weekend had said he didn't think 
Clinton was up to the job of being commander in chief of the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "My view is that he is the commander in chief," Dole said. "I think he's done 
a little better . . . with Haiti, maybe with the Mideast. I think he's doing 
better all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), who is seeking to become Senate minority 
leader, blasted Helms' comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is coming close to aiding and abetting insubordination of the commander 
in chief" at a time when the United States is engaged in many sensitive 
situations around the world, Dodd said on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation."

PLANS TO CUT SAFETY NET LEAVE LEGAL IMMIGRANTS DANGLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a dozen years after moving from Peru, Heidi was employed full time, first 
at a cannery and then at a fast-food restaurant. But her precarious hold on 
economic solvency slipped three years ago when her newborn's father left to 
join the fighting in the former Yugoslavia and never returned. 
</P>
<P>
 She began receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children, food stamps and 
Medicaid -- benefits accorded for decades to legal immigrants and citizens 
alike. 
</P>
<P>
 But a proposal by the Republican leadership in Congress would reserve such 
benefits only for citizens, denying any form of welfare to non-citizens living 
legally in this country. The estimated $22 billion in savings over five years 
would be used to help offset tax cuts and other initiatives proposed in the 
Republicans' "contract with America." 
</P>
<P>
 House Republicans contend that the midterm elections demonstrated, in these 
uncertain economic times, that Americans have tired of offering cash 
assistance, health care, job training, school lunches, food stamps and scores 
of other benefits to the 10.5 million non-citizens living legally in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our welfare benefits are an attraction to people to come to this country, and 
they should be cut off," said Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr. (R-Fla.), who is in line to 
become chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on human resources, 
which would have jurisdiction over the proposal. "We should take care of our 
own with the resources we have." 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, advocates of the plan say, many of the people receiving such aid 
are parents of U.S. citizens who can well afford to support them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is likely to be heated debate on the subject when the 104th 
Congress convenes in January, both Democrats and Republicans predict that such 
a proposal could be approved. If so, it would mark a dramatic shift in the 
nation's view of its social contract with immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed change would do no less than "redefine membership in this society 
for legal immigrants and change the climate of cultural acceptance for legal 
residents," said Michael Fix, a senior analyst at the Urban Institute, an 
independent research group, who specializes in immigration issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the Clinton Administration opposes the Republican plan, 
arguing that it would adversely affect public health, shift costs to state and 
local governments and leave an estimated 1.5 million people without financial 
support. Approximately 40% of those people live in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Heidi helps drive home their point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here 15 years ago and always paid taxes and always worked," said 
Heidi, 41, who asked that her last name not be used. "I've only gotten help for 
three years. If I get a little more help so I can establish myself a little, 
then I will get another job and start paying taxes again," she said in an 
interview from a homeless shelter, where she lives with her 3-year-old child. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those affected by the proposal would be parents of U.S. citizens who 
immigrated to join their families and, after a three- to five-year moratorium, 
turned to public assistance for a pension and health benefits; refugees from 
persecution who were granted sanctuary in the United States and fell on hard 
times, and families who, because of divorce, job loss, disability or other 
difficulties, found themselves in need of a safety net. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the proposal would deny immigrant children free federally funded 
school lunches and immunizations. The only people who would still be eligible 
for some income support would be immigrants older than 75 who had been in the 
country for at least five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although people applying to enter this country must demonstrate that they have 
sufficient financial means to support themselves -- either through their own 
income or with help from a sponsor -- they have since the 1960s become eligible 
for the same aid as U.S. citizens if their finances fail them. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those who immigrate for the purpose of reuniting families -- and thus 
have sponsors to help support them initially -- can qualify for food stamps, 
AFDC or Medicaid after three years. Congress last year temporarily extended the 
waiting period to five years for Supplemental Security Income, the cash 
assistance available to the elderly, blind and disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrants like Heidi, who are granted permanent residency for reasons of 
employment or as refugees, need not undergo a waiting period before receiving 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Rep. Barbara Jordan (D-Tex.), who chairs the bipartisan U.S. Commission 
on Immigration Reform, said the Republican proposal contradicts the underlying 
philosophy behind U.S. immigration policy: that legal immigration is a 
"strength of this country" and should be encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Legal permanent residents should continue to be eligible for needs-tested 
assistance programs," she told a congressional committee considering welfare 
reform this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The safety net provided by welfare programs should be for those members of 
our social community who are in most need . . ." regardless of their 
citizenship, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan and others expressed concern that by denying benefits to non-citizens, 
the GOP proposal would encourage immigrants to see citizenship solely as a 
ticket to welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want immigrants to seek citizenship because it is the only route to 
our safety nets," Jordan said. "To me, that would be a debasement of our 
notions of citizenship." 
</P>
<P>
 Other advocates for immigrants argue that because legal immigrants are treated 
like citizens when it comes to paying taxes and serving in the armed forces, 
they should be rewarded with equal treatment when it comes to qualifying for 
financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we're asking for is equal rights," said Nam Loc Nguyen, who heads 
immigrant legal services for Catholic Charities in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 These advocates also note that non-citizens cannot vote, making them a 
convenient target for politicians. In fact, the overwhelming approval of 
California's Proposition 187, which denies all but emergency medical aid to 
illegal immigrants, was seen as proof that voters are likely to reward 
political office-seekers who advocate ending benefits for immigrants, said 
analysts and members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "They see a short-term gain from capitalizing on anti-immigrant sentiment," 
said Charles Wheeler of the National Center on Immigrant Rights. "It's welfare 
elimination for a group of people who are currently out of favor and don't 
vote. We have a history in the United States of praising prior waves of 
immigrants but doubting the current batch of arrivals." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento), who opposes the GOP plan, contends that 
it simply shifts responsibility from the federal government to the states. That 
is an argument that resonates among local officials, who maintain that 
immigrants needing aid would simply turn to them. County general relief and 
medical costs in Orange County, for instance, would soar, according to Angelo 
Doti, director of financial assistance for the Orange County Social Services 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Doti said that to avoid a tremendous cost shift, any change in the law must 
specify that state and local governments similarly can prohibit non-citizens 
from receiving benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 His agency is already feeling the effect of the federal government's decision 
to change the waiting period for SSI benefits from three to five years. So far, 
he said, his office has tracked 250 cases in which immigrants who became 
ineligible for SSI turned to the county for assistance. Most, he said, were 
elderly parents of citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "We consider a lot of this to be abuse," he said, because many of those 
immigrants could be supported by their children. 
</P>
<P>
 He and others expressed dismay that current law enables children to bring 
their parents to the United States, support them for a few years and then 
expect the federal government to provide cash assistance, food stamps and 
health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are not going to be on the streets if the government cuts them 
off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But advocates for immigrants stressed that many of the people affected by the 
law would be refugees or other immigrants who are without family members to 
rely on or whose families are too poor to support them for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just going to end up increasing poverty overall, and then we all 
suffer," said Sonia Perez, a poverty policy analyst for the National Council of 
La Raza. "It's very easy to say just cut them off, but it has a lot 
implications for all of us and not just for that group of people."

COMPETITION FOR SUPPLIES FIERCE AMONG FOOD BANKS; CHARITY: COMPANIES 
INCREASINGLY SELL SALVAGED GOODS THEY ONCE DONATED. MORE OF THE HUNGRY ARE 
TURNED AWAY.

 Nuns and church volunteers who run Los Angeles' charitable food pantries 
circle like wily prizefighters around a pile of boxes filled with dented food 
cans and torn cereal packages at the Los Angeles Regional Foodbank. Today is 
"Monday Madness," the bank's weekly food grab, where affiliated pantries cart 
off damaged foods donated by supermarkets and food companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "No pushing! No fighting! No name-calling!" a food bank employee warns. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers swarm over the heap, colliding as they reach for the choicest loot, 
running the boxes back to their pantry's zealously guarded stash. "Grab it! 
Grab it!" pants one nun to another. 
</P>
<P>
 Older church workers complain of being nearly trampled in the rush for food, 
which they take from the food bank and distribute to the hungry through a 
network of pantries. Fistfights sometimes erupt. "It's like we're going into a 
wrestling match," says Holy Cross parish pantry director Suzanne Snyder, who 
steers clear of the coveted frozen meat boxes "for fear of physical harm." 
</P>
<P>
 The skirmish for food has turned frenzied as charitable groups -- which 
flourished in the 1980s as one of America's primary responses to a rising tide 
of hunger -- struggle to survive cuts in their lifeblood: food company 
donations. Gifts of "secondary" and "salvage" foods to Second Harvest, 
coordinator of the nation's largest network of food banks, slipped 11.2% in the 
first 10 months of the year -- a drop of 23.5 million pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies grappling with debt from leveraged buyouts and razor-thin margins 
are selling what they once gave away, fueling a $2.4-billion industry of dented 
or expired products trafficked under tarps in flea markets or in secondary food 
stores -- from Scratch 'N Dent Food Shops in Plant City, Fla., to Dentco in 
Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a national change in corporate priorities . . . ," frets L.A. 
Regional Foodbank Executive Director Doris Bloch, turning with trepidation to a 
Los Angeles map riddled with 758 red dots -- one for each agency -- that rely 
on her bank to feed 300,000 weekly. At the food bank, donations from national 
food companies have dropped 41% so far this year. And in a UCLA study from 
1993, one in four hungry families seeking food were already being turned away 
by Los Angeles pantries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I eat Rolaids regularly. This scares me to death," says Deborah Keegan, 
marketing director for Second Harvest, whose affiliated pantries fed nearly 21 
million families last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle of the conflict are the giant food manufacturers, torn between 
needed profits and charitable giving. The pressures can be intense: At a recent 
conference, a secondary food chain executive urged corporations to forsake 
traditional policies of donations and sell to his market instead. 
</P>
<P>
 He drilled home the point: selling, not giving, helps companies reel in more 
cash. Still, the Grocery Manufacturers of America board -- a trade group that 
represents the nation's largest food companies -- has urged members to keep 
giving. 
</P>
<P>
 Augie Fernandes, vice president of a supermarket consulting firm and an expert 
on the salvage business, says four of 10 major food companies in the past two 
years have begun selling secondary foods, and he predicts donations could drop 
another 30%. Says Fernandes: "The food banks are in trouble." In the Pantries: 
A Daily Balancing Act 
</P>
<P>
 At the Community Food Bank of West Covina, pantry coordinator Victoria 
Portillo begins a daily balancing act: helping people, but not running dry 
before closing time. Portillo unlocks the heavy metal door of the old school 
that serves as the distribution point for food. People step inside, one at a 
time, eyes cast downward, voices sometimes cracking. "They never thought they 
would lose their job. They never thought they would be here," Portillo says. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, a cadre of elderly men, all volunteers, unload food from a rickety 
donated pickup truck. Inside, a silver-haired woman prepares the packages to be 
distributed: a small grocery bag containing canned goods and pasta, bread and a 
home-grown cucumber donated by a neighbor, a ration more generous than on some 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 A middle-aged woman, divorced, is first to swing open the pantry's door. Five 
children cling to her skirt. "Is this your first time here?" Portillo says. 
When she asks this question, grown men often break down, quietly sobbing. "You 
can come five times in a lifetime -- period," Portillo tells the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Portillo calculates what she has in stock, then plucks one of a few chocolate 
cakes stashed in the pantry freezer and piles that on top of the bag of 
groceries. The children quickly gather around the food. Their eyes devour the 
dessert. The mother fights off tears. "I didn't know what I was going to do for 
my child's birthday this Saturday," she says, cradling the bag of food in her 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
 But when a man comes in with his wife and three young children, Portillo tells 
them she cannot help, because they used up their five visits four years before. 
The woman's expression turns from hope to desperation. Her husband becomes 
belligerent. "Give me some bread! Give me some bread! I got three hungry 
children here!" he says, springing menacingly from his chair. Portillo 
fearfully shoves several loaves into his arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my last time," says a young woman who enters near closing time, a 
tinge of despair in her voice. Portillo suddenly realizes the pantry is down to 
a few loaves of bread. She madly snatches back some of the loaves volunteers 
have put into the young woman's cart; Portillo needs to stretch what's left for 
the half-dozen families still lined up outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half of 9,300 pantries and soup kitchens surveyed nationwide have 
recently been forced to slash the amount of food they give each family, Second 
Harvest found. Glendale's Salvation Army has cut the number of yearly visits in 
half to six; some pantries allow one food request per year. At L.A. First 
Church of the Nazarene's pantry, which feeds the first 100 people to arrive 
three times a week, the hungry line up before dawn to claim one of the coveted 
food bags, which are given out mid-morning. Twenty San Bernardino and Riverside 
County pantries in the past 1 1/2 years have shut their doors altogether, says 
Daryl Brock, executive director of Riverside's Survive Food Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't much food available," laments Rita Russo, one of two nuns who 
founded the Seedling, a South-Central Los Angeles pantry. The line of people 
stretches halfway down the block from the pantry's red, green and yellow tent, 
where volunteers sort turnips and cans of food into boxes that once contained a 
week's supply, but have dwindled to three or even two days of food. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seedling and other pantries are bracing for cuts in their other main food 
source: government surplus items -- made famous by massive cheese giveaways in 
the 1980s -- which provide Los Angeles County's big food banks with nearly four 
of every 10 pounds distributed, but have been slashed by two-thirds for next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 In late 1993, the Seedling had government surplus foods only, and by 
Christmas, just two items remained: beans and butter. This year, it may have to 
close for the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard desperate mothers say we just prayed through last night because 
there was nothing to eat," said Russo, who often watches children sit on the 
floor of the pantry's giant tent and tear open packages of bread, feasting on 
the floor as if the loaves were ambrosia. "To me, this is a gospel need. Jesus 
said, 'Feed thy neighbor.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly one-third of those who come to U.S. food agencies are the working poor, 
people who can't pay high rents on minimum wage and still put three meals on 
the table, a survey last year by Second Harvest found. Single parents make up 
more than two-thirds of pantry and soup kitchen clients, and children, who are 
a quarter of the population, were almost half of emergency food recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 Most who come to the agencies were recently unemployed. A majority don't get 
food stamps, either because of the stigma of applying or misunderstandings 
about eligibility. More than four of five who get the coupons said the aid 
never lasts the month. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, food bank advocates convinced great numbers of food companies 
that it was better to donate food than to shovel it into landfills. The 
Government Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, estimated that as 
much as 20% of all food grown in the U.S. -- up to two tons per person, per 
year -- was thrown away. Food banks touted the write-offs corporations would 
get, and battled companies' fear that donating less-than-perfect food would 
tarnish their product's carefully cultivated image. 
</P>
<P>
 Firms faced the mounting P.R. problem of wasted food as hunger, which appeared 
to be nearly eliminated by the War on Poverty program, resurfaced in the 1980s. 
"The trickle of people became a river," says Carolyn Olney of Los Angeles' 
Interfaith Hunger Coalition. Grass-roots food pantries and soup kitchens 
quadrupled to 40,000 between 1982 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, more than 1 billion pounds flowed to the food banks from food 
companies and supermarkets -- products that flopped, were discontinued or had 
expired code dates or production errors. General Mills Inc. donated cereals 
that were too lightly toasted or had flakes that were too small. Its biggest 
giveaway: $3 million of Cheerios boxes containing a toy ball on which a 
1-year-old child choked to death. (The food banks had to promise to remove the 
balls before distributing the cereal.) 
</P>
<P>
 American consumers -- particularly sensitive since the tampering scares -- set 
aside all but the most pristine packages. (Food bank volunteers sort through 
cans, removing any that appear questionable. Laws enacted in the '80s protect 
companies from liability when they donate food.) 
</P>
<P>
 But by the 1990s, being hailed as a big donor had become something of an 
embarrassment -- a red alert to shareholders that a company was wasteful and 
inefficient. Two years ago, food company executives began warning food bankers 
to look elsewhere for food. "They said, look guys, we love you, but we're going 
to sell this. We have to look to the bottom line," recalls Bloch, of the L.A. 
Regional Food Bank. Excess food was increasingly sold to Pic 'N' Save, 99 Cents 
Only Stores and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Major American food companies balk at revealing the proportion of "unsalable" 
goods they sell to secondary merchants. For example, Quaker Oats Co., whose 
donations declined from $11.9 million in fiscal 1993 to $5.1 million in fiscal 
1994, will not specify how much secondary food it sold. A spokesman attributed 
most of the drop to increased efficiencies that decreased the quantity of 
unsalable food available. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite critics in the world of food banks, the corporations have many 
defenders. They note that few other industries are expected to give away a 
significant part of their goods to the needy, and that they shouldn't be 
expected to take the place of the government in feeding America's hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Food retailers are in business to make money," says Fernandes, the salvage 
expert. "Companies have to recover their losses. They want to put these 
products back onto their bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
 And indeed, many firms try to balance charity with fiscal necessity. The Vons 
Cos. grocery chain sells 15% of its salvage and much of its discontinued foods, 
but donates 12 trailers of food each week to 150 local charities. 
</P>
<P>
 General Mills, which was unable to say how much it sells to secondary sources, 
donates $10.5 million in food yearly. Still, said General Mills Foundation vice 
president David Nasby: "It's always better to sell your product than to give it 
away." Bargain Shopping in the Salvage Aisle 
</P>
<P>
 Sandwiched on a lonely stretch of road between a massage parlor and a 
motorcycle shop, Dentco is doing a booming business with the food companies' 
change of heart. Founder Orlan T. Riggs, who until his heart surgery presided 
over a five-store dented can empire from Yucaipa to Santa Ana, now pours all 
his energy into his Fontana store. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday mornings, up to 50 people line up outside the mustard-colored 
cinder block building, waiting to pick over the wire bins of taped boxes and 
tarnished fare. An employee empties dozens of dented cans into huge bins, 
replenishing what customers have purchased. "All of the name brands are here," 
he says, proudly motioning to the damaged items being scrutinized by customers 
under a Spartan row of fluorescent lights. 
</P>
<P>
 At the high end of the salvage industry is Canned Foods Grocery Outlets in 
Berkeley. Known as the the Cadillac of the business, Canned Foods promises a 
"discreet outlet for remarketing your products" to 76 of the country's largest 
food companies. Canned Foods has grown into more than 100 stores in six western 
states. Enthusiastic blurbs from executives for Hormel Foods Corp. and Sara Lee 
Bakery adorn Canned Foods' glossy marketing brochure. 
</P>
<P>
 Less glossy -- but highly popular -- is Joe Sanchez's place in Lincoln 
Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of an underground business," says Sanchez, president of La 
Quebradita (the Broken Thing), whose facade carries a bucolic rendering of a 
man wearing a sombrero astride a muscular horse pulling a shopping cart full of 
groceries. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez inches past his store's beauty salon and restaurant into a back room, 
where huge bins overflow with damaged packages of microwave pudding and torn 
boxes of cereals. (Sanchez says the boxes have an inner package that protects 
the food and that he tosses out anything questionable.) The back room is for 
the real bargains. "This is where people won't run into their neighbor," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez buys 2,000 boxes full of dented cans each month from grocery chains 
for $6 to $11 each, marks up the price 28%, and makes an 8% profit, at least 
four times what supermarkets in Southern California net. "It's a super 
business," he says effusively. Starting with a $3,800 initial investment, 
Sanchez has used profits to open two large grocery stores and a sausage 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, supermarkets donated everything. They want the green now. They want 
cash," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The most vigorous salvage sales have perhaps been at flea markets, some of 
which have seen the number of vendors quadruple in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Ruby sold shoes for 11 years at the Cypress College swap meet, until the 
recession caused sales to dry up. He looked across the aisle to see his swap 
meet neighbor madly selling dented cans of food. "People can't afford shoes. 
But they gotta eat," he says with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
 Low prices scream out from fluorescent pieces of cardboard. Most of the goods 
on display have outlived their printed expiration date, sometimes by four 
months. Some cans are rusty. At a neighboring salvage food stand, where food is 
as much as eight months past the code date, mayonnaise with no paper label sits 
in the hot sun, huge air pockets developing in the middle of the jars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get a lot of calls each day from people who want to buy this stuff," says 
Manuel Duran, manager of salvage operations for Certified Grocers of 
California, made up of 2,200 small grocers and chains. "C'mon, just show me 
what you got," people cajole him, said Duran, standing in the heart of 
Certified Grocer's salvage operations, a dimly lit City of Commerce warehouse 
where huge fans churn the heavy air. Last year, he sold about $3.8 million 
worth of food products to intermediaries that distributed the goods to peddlers 
and stores. Duran, who says the sales help supermarkets keep regular food 
prices down, can name only six companies that still require him to donate their 
damaged products. Out on the dock today, amid a swarm of small flies: crushed 
packages of cup noodles that he'll sell, mangled cans of green beans, fruit 
cocktail. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvage and secondary food operators such as Canned Foods aggressively call 
Second Harvest's corporate food donors weekly, often offering to buy products 
sight unseen. Food banks counterattack by warning companies that salvage 
operators might not handle their product well, and prey on their fears that 
people who buy their brand in a salvage store might have otherwise purchased it 
at a regular store at full price. Calling salvage sales a ticking time bomb, 
they claim that some salvage operators aren't careful to eliminate all swollen 
cans or those dented at the seam that could lead to botulism poisoning, a 
bacteria infection that can be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in the salvage industry counter that they are as vigilant as food banks 
and pantries in weeding out suspect food products. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfonso Medina, chief of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services 
food and milk program, said his inspectors have found at least two cases this 
year of swollen and potentially dangerous cans of salvage food being sold at 
swap meets. 
</P>
<P>
 To be safe, he says, salvagers must glean out about half the cans they buy, 
tossing out "flippers, swellers or leakers" -- cans that are swollen on one 
end, both ends, or dented at the seam. Medina said he knew of no questionable 
food distributed at food banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvage customer Julio Herrera is grateful for the secondary food industry and 
the bargains it provides him. "I can't live without these guys!" raves Herrera, 
taking a break as he and five of his six children rummage through 16 rows of 
banana boxes full of motley food products under a gray tarp at the outer edge 
of the Santa Fe Springs swap meet. They select torn bags of rice. 
</P>
<P>
 Before finding the salvage stand two years ago, Herrera was unable on his 
$15,000 annual salary as a truck driver to put three meals on the table for his 
children. A church pantry, he says, nonetheless rejected him, saying his income 
was too high. "They said other people were more needy," he says, casting his 
eyes downward as he recalls the embarrassment of asking for food, then being 
turned away empty-handed. He now buys 95% of his groceries at the stand. 'What 
Is to Become of These Hungry People?' 
</P>
<P>
 As corporations wrestle with whether it is better to sell or give, food bank 
proponents have learned they must become more aggressive to survive. Second 
Harvest typically takes four or five days to tell food manufacturers anxious to 
clear their docks whether or not they want a food gift, said Mike Mulqueen, 
director of the Greater Chicago Food Depository. 
</P>
<P>
 Foodbank of Southern California, Los Angeles' second largest, left the Second 
Harvest network in 1991, dissatisfied that 82% of what they were receiving were 
snack foods such as candy, potato chips and sodas. Contacting food companies on 
its own, donations rose 86% the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, you waited at your desk for the phone to ring and the food to flow 
in. Food banks have to be hungrier and work their tails off now," said John F. 
Knapp, president of the Foodbank. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big major donors may be tapped out. But lots of medium-sized companies 
haven't been asked to join the hunger fight," agreed Mark Lowry of Orange 
County's Community Development Council food bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Some food bank authorities say they must also turn to different and more 
nourishing foods, such as produce, fish and leftovers from restaurants. Half of 
the food banks approached this year about starting programs to use vegetables 
and fruits that cannot be sold but are still edible rejected the idea, said 
Susan Evans, a professor at the Institute for Health Promotion and Disease 
Prevention Research at the University of Southern California. "Food banks 
haven't been responsive to change," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 Love Is Feeding Everyone (LIFE), a Los Angeles food bank begun by actors 
Dennis Weaver and Valerie Harper, trucks milk, meat and bakery products from 52 
Hughes markets to needy institutions, but most supermarkets haven't been 
tapped, says James Schiffner, LIFE's chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 As another sign of their evolution, a few pantries, such as St. Joseph Center 
in Venice, are becoming social service agencies, providing help to get jobs, 
parenting skills and budgeting classes, convinced that the only solution is to 
stem the number of people who live in poverty and need help. 
</P>
<P>
 But for many in the hunger movement, the pantry's problems have caused a 
fundamental questioning of whether their core principle -- that private charity 
can take the place of government -- works in the leaner '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone agrees government services need to be cut. But at the same time, the 
private sector says they have to be mean and lean," says Bloch, of the L.A. 
Regional Foodbank. "So what is to become of these hungry people?" About This

 HOW DOES IT WORK 
</P>
<P>
 The six food banks in Los Angeles County are non-profit institutions that 
solicit unsaleable but still edible food from food companies, restaurants, 
produce markets and other sources. They also store government-issued food such 
as butter, beans, and, in the past, cheese. They hold the food in a warehouse 
and distribute it for a nominal fee to the approximately 700 member food 
pantries in Los Angeles County. These pantries are typically church-sponsored 
organizations run on shoestring budgets by volunteers. Some pantries have cut 
back on the amount of food they give out because of shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 WHO USES FOOD BANKS 
</P>
<P>
 Most people who go to pantries for help do not receive food stamps -- either 
because of the stigma of using the coupons or ignorance about the government 
anti-hunger program. A 1993 research study by Second Harvest, the Chicago-based 
network for food banks and pantries, found these statistis on emergency food 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
 31.5% seek assistance for three months or less. 
</P>
<P>
 39.6% seek assistance for more than one year. 
</P>
<P>
 18.1% are homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 14.3% own their own home. 
</P>
<P>
 45.8% are children. In the total U.S. population, the proportion of people 
under 18 is 25.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 61.7% have no car. 
</P>
<P>
 46.7% have no phone. 
</P>
<P>
 39.6% have no high school diploma. 
</P>
<P>
 48.3% get food stamps.

<P>
 AMERICAN FAITH: Thanksgiving was fondly observed in the Bronx by little Harold 
Schulweis, now rabbi at Valley Beth Shalom in Encino -- not least because 
turkey is kosher and the holiday is nondenominational. To him, "Thanksgiving is 
America at its finest" because it "symbolizes the dream of a society that 
avoids the entanglement of the state in the affairs of religion or the 
imposition of a particular religion." 
</P>
<P>
 RARE SERVICES: Few churches hold Thanksgiving Day services, except for 
Christian Science -- perhaps a pilgrim influence on the Boston-based 
denomination, a spokesman said. Gratitude is the theme of services at 12 local 
churches from Glendale to Woodland Hills to Santa Clarita, including the 11 
a.m. service at the large 37th Church of Christ, Scientist, in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 FOOD PANTRY: It's a Valley success story. Since 1983, more than 260,300 people 
have been given two-day emergency food supplies at the North Hollywood 
Interfaith Food Pantry, where Roy Presley totes bread, above. Ten congregations 
support the program, storing food at Temple Beth Hillel and distributing it 
Mondays and Fridays at First Christian Church. About 300 are expected at the 
group's annual Thanksgiving Eve interfaith service, 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at 
Temple Beth Hillel in Valley Village. 
</P>
<P>
 'TIS THE SEASON: Tinsel, stars and tree decorations arrived in stores weeks 
ago, but the original Christmas season -- Advent -- doesn't officially begin 
until Sunday, often the occasion for special music programs. This year, 
Christmas Day itself falls on a Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 ALREADY HANUKKAH: This Sunday evening marks the earliest start this century of 
the Jewish festival of Hanukkah, notes Rabbi Gary E. Johnson of Agoura Hill's 
Temple Beth Haverim. Although the eight-day holiday doesn't compete directly 
this year with Christmas, the rabbi urged members of his 350-family synagogue 
to display a Hanukkah menorah in front windows to announce their dedication to 
Judaism in a secular world. John Dart

CSU CASE MAY BECOME LEGAL TEST FOR PROP. 187; COURTS: A 2-YEAR-OLD LAWSUIT 
SEEKS TO FORCE THE CAL STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM TO REQUIRE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO 
PAY OUT-OF-STATE TUITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A case involving whether illegal immigrants attending colleges in the 
California State University system should pay higher out-of-state fees could 
serve as a legal precedent for the courtroom battle to be fought over 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed two years ago by several taxpayer and immigration reform 
groups, aims to force the Cal State system to revoke its policy of allowing 
illegal immigrants to pay the lower tuition fees reserved for California 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 That case "could test the constitutionality of 187, at least as it applies to 
higher education," said USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky, who specializes in 
constitutional law. "It could be one of several cases cited when 187 goes to 
court." 
</P>
<P>
 Both the University of California and state community colleges are abiding by 
a 1990 state appellate court ruling -- called the Bradford decision -- that 
required the UC system to charge out-of-state fees to students who are not here 
legally. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Cal State system decided to follow a 1985 Alameda County decision 
allowing illegal immigrants who live in California to pay the same fees as the 
state's legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Because illegal immigrants are ineligible for all federal and state financial 
aid, many students seeking a college education now find Cal State is the only 
choice they can afford. Financial aid is available only to those who can prove 
they are legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, Cal State is the only option for undocumented students," said 
Linda Loya, a college counselor at Huntington Park High School. "Every year, at 
least two of the students who graduate in the top 10 are undocumented, and most 
of them go to Cal State schools." 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Superior Court judge ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in 
September, 1992, but Cal State appealed the decision. The 2nd District Court of 
Appeals is expected to hear the case as soon as the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be the hottest case in the state because it will serve as a 
precedent to 187," said Richard Knickerbocker, an attorney representing the 
seven groups and three individuals who filed the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Leslie Dutton, president of the American Assn. of Women, one of the 
groups challenging the tuition policy: "It will be a forerunner to 187 because 
it reflects the question as to whether taxpayers should help pay for the 
education of people who are here illegally. It'll show the disposition of the 
courts on this issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, which was approved by nearly 60% of the state's voters, bars 
illegal immigrants from publicly funded education, social services and 
non-emergency health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Enforcement has been temporarily blocked by a federal judge in Los Angeles, 
after several groups filed lawsuits contending that the measure is 
unconstitutional. The case is likely to be fought in both state and federal 
courts for the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal State case will likely be resolved first. However, if Proposition 187 
is upheld, it would make the earlier ruling moot, because illegal immigrants 
would be excluded from all the state's public schools, said Cal State spokesman 
Steve MacCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole issue of whether we should charge in-state or out-of-state fees 
would be thrown out the window," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And even if Proposition 187 is determined to be unconstitutional, illegal 
immigrants could still be forced to pay the higher fees, if the ruling in the 
Cal State case supports the Bradford decision. 
</P>
<P>
 According to university estimates, there are about 950 illegal residents 
enrolled at Cal State's 20 campuses. They pay $1,584 annually in resident fees, 
compared to the $7,380 tuition charged students from outside the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Knickerbocker, however, challenges that estimate. "I think that's really low. 
The university doesn't require students to prove their legal status, so how can 
they know how many illegal students there really are?" 
</P>
<P>
 Luis, a Cal State Los Angeles junior who is here illegally, said he would have 
to withdraw from school if he is forced to pay the higher fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feeling I have is that we're not wanted," he said. "People want us to 
have low incomes and seem afraid of us succeeding." 
</P>
<P>
 The 23-year-old came to Los Angeles nine years ago from Durango, Mexico. He 
graduated from Fremont High School and now works full-time in an office to earn 
money to pay tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked in construction, at a restaurant and in the fields in Napa Valley 
to get an education here," he said. "I eventually want to transfer to UCLA to 
get my master's degree in anthropology. I know it sounds unrealistic for me to 
say that, but I still have dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cal State officials did not take a formal stance on Proposition 187, 
MacCarthy said there are "grave concerns" about its possible implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 Implementing the initiative would require the university to violate federal 
privacy laws in disclosing the legal status of its students, MacCarthy said, 
and could cost the system all its federal funding, including its financial aid 
for students. 
</P>
<P>
 About 65,000 of Cal State's 320,000 students receive $112 million in federal 
Pell grants, according to university figures. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Cal State's plans to open a new campus on the former Ft. Ord army 
base in Monterey County may be in jeopardy, since the university received $130 
million from the U.S. Army to convert the 2,000-acre base. Cal State hopes to 
open the campus next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will comply with the law, whatever it is," said Christine Helwick, Cal 
State's general counsel.

ENDANGERED BIRDS LOSE GROUND TO INVADERS; NATURE: AGGRESSIVE AVIAN SPECIES ARE 
COMPETING FOR FOOD WITH LEAST TERNS IN A PRESERVE. A STUDY WILL HELP DETERMINE 
IF THEY CAN COEXIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They were weekly fixtures throughout the summer, during the sea bird mating 
season at the Bolsa Chica Ecological Preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing rubber boots and sporting binoculars, the team of graduate students 
tromped through the marshes, looking for bits of half-eaten fish discarded by 
the birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacqueline Wilson said she was willing to do it for science and to make a 
contribution to the local ecology. She and her colleague from Cal State 
Fullerton are helping to conduct a study funded by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Its purpose: to determine whether the Bolsa Chica wetlands' fragile colony of 
endangered California least terns is further threatened by the recent arrival 
of some rather aggressive feathered cousins. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a natural invasion," said Michael Horn, the Cal State Fullerton 
professor and biologist who is conducting the study. "Nobody wants to scuttle 
the new birds. What we want to do is find out if they can peacefully coexist." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Horn, the trouble started about 10 years ago when the area's 
long-established least tern colony began being eclipsed by the arrival of more 
aggressive subspecies: elegant terns, Caspian terns, Forster's terns and black 
skimmers. 
</P>
<P>
 A small bird with a black cap and yellow bill, the California least tern 
numbers about 2,000 mating pairs statewide and is on the state and federal 
endangered species lists. After spending its winters in South America, 
biologists say, the bird migrates north in mid-April to various California 
locations where it nests in the sand and lays eggs that hatch a month or two 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 To aid in that process, state biologists in the mid-1970s constructed two 
nesting islands at Bolsa Chica, complete with open stretches of sand and tile 
shelters for older chicks, conveniences that eventually began attracting an 
average of 200 mating pairs -- about 10% of the state's population. 
</P>
<P>
 But by 1991, the endangered birds on one of the islands had been completely 
displaced by the four larger and more aggressive competitors. "There's only a 
limited amount of nesting space," Horn said, "and the least terns just couldn't 
hold up under this kind of onslaught. When you have an endangered species, 
every loss of a nesting site hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually the competition for nesting space cooled, with the endangered birds 
remaining on the southernmost island and the new arrivals claiming the island 
to the north. Still undetermined, however, is the long-range effect of the 
competition for food -- specifically, biologists say, whether their diets are 
similar enough to allow the larger and more aggressive new arrivals to 
eventually starve out the least terns. 
</P>
<P>
 To find out, Horn began his study in 1992. Each week during the nesting 
season, generally from early May to late September, the professor and his 
students don rubber boots, wade or row over to Bolsa Chica's northernmost 
nesting island and spend the day collecting fish fragments that were either 
regurgitated, discarded half-eaten or dropped untouched by the 4,000 to 5,000 
birds believed to be nesting there. 
</P>
<P>
 The students also spend hours using binoculars to watch the birds' activities 
from observation points. And occasionally they board boats to follow the 
foraging animals as far as six miles out to sea to document where their prey 
comes from. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Horn said, the teams collected about 1,000 bags of fish fragments, 
all of which they are now painstakingly analyzing in a university laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more than 50 types of fish identified so far, according to Horn, are 
the northern anchovy, Pacific sardine, California grunion, top smelt, 
jacksmelt, California killifish, long jaw mudsucker, Mozambique tilapia, 
largemouth bass and bluegill. 
</P>
<P>
 The study is supported by a $9,000 grant from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, and Horn expects to publish the findings in a paper in June. So far, 
he said, it does not appear that the feathered newcomers of Bolsa Chica are 
competing with the endangered old-timers for food. 
</P>
<P>
 While all the birds share a pronounced taste for anchovies and sardines, the 
biologist said, the least terns appear to go after fish too small to be 
bothered by the more aggressive birds, which also have a much broader diet. 
</P>
<P>
 "What that probably means is that coexistence is possible," Horn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition for nesting space, on the other hand, appears to be fierce, which 
probably will prompt Horn to recommend that new nesting islands be built.

BOND DEFEATS DELAY RAIL EXPANSION PLANS; TRANSIT: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY EAST-WEST 
RAIL LINE AND THE BLUE LINE TO PASADENA COULD BE AFFECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At the dawn of the 1990s, Californians seemed poised for a major expansion of 
their transportation network and ready to make the down payment on a mammoth 
rail system that would help divorce people from their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 By a surprising margin, voters approved a doubling of gasoline taxes -- 9 
cents per gallon -- and authorized nearly $3 billion in bonds to pay for rail 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a scant four years later, the voters are demonstrating a change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Their refusal in three elections, including the one Nov. 8, to approve bond 
issues totaling $4 billion has put the program in such perilous financial 
straits that, officials say, many transportation projects will have to be 
delayed three to four years and no new ones can be considered until 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question that absent some radical injection of revenue . . . 
these bond failures are going to have a significant impact on our 
transportation program," said Mark Watts, undersecretary of the Business, 
Transportation and Housing Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the loss of revenue could delay by years rail projects such as 
the east-west San Fernando Valley rail line and the expansion of the Blue Line 
to Pasadena. Highway projects that could be affected include the extension of 
the Foothill Freeway in the San Gabriel Valley and the completion of a system 
of high-occupancy-vehicle lanes along the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as anything else, the transportation program embarked on four years 
ago with the rosy promise that it would modernize the system for the 21st 
Century has become the victim of California's earthquakes, economic recession 
and voter disgruntlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquakes, both Loma Prieta in 1989 and Northridge in January, 
heightened the need to strengthen vulnerable bridges, causing retrofitting 
costs to soar from about $750 million in 1990 to more than $2.5 billion today. 
At the same time, the economic recession caused both gasoline tax revenues and 
federal transportation dollars contributed to California to be much lower than 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters delivered another blow to the program in 1992, when they rejected 
Proposition 156, a $1-billion bond issue to finance rail projects. The 
California Transportation Commission had approved projects in anticipation that 
the bonds would pass. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, voters defeated a $2-billion issue proposed by Gov. Pete Wilson to 
help pay for the retrofitting. And on Nov. 8, voters struck down Proposition 
181 as they registered their dissatisfaction with taxes and spending. The 
proposal would have authorized another $1-billion bond issue for rail programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think these were really anti-transportation votes," said commission 
Chairwoman Octavia Diener. "I think they were priority votes, the priority 
being, 'Let's get the economy back in shape and then we can start having 
visions of high-speed rail and an improved transportation system.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Camph, a transportation policy consultant in Culver City, saw the 
defeat as part of an overall negative mood by voters toward spending, with 
transportation funding an easy target. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they are generally saying no to government, no to government 
spending, no to government programs," he said. "That seems to be the message 
across the board. They're turning down a lot of stuff they never have before." 
</P>
<P>
 The setbacks have left the state transportation program with an estimated 
$4.5-billion financial hole. Officials say they have only one clear way to deal 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of finishing the program in seven years, it will have to be stretched 
out over at least 12 years. Instead of adding new projects every two years, new 
projects won't be added until 1998, at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 As the bad financial news hit local transportation agencies statewide, many, 
including the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority, began 
searching for ways to avoid the delays. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Bohlinger, the MTA's deputy executive officer for capital planning, said 
her agency is investigating whether it can front load some of its projects with 
local money. That way, the local share of the costs would be paid in the early 
stages of each project, with the hope that by the time the local money ran out, 
state funds would be available. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the MTA staff expects to have a recommendation in time for a Dec. 16 
board workshop on financial planning. It will be especially important, she 
said, to find ways to keep the two rail projects -- the extension of the Blue 
Line and the construction of the San Fernando Valley rail line -- on track. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Diener said the financial crisis has put more pressure on 
government to come up with alternatives to fund transportation, particularly 
rail projects. State Transportation Secretary Dean Dunphy is expected in a few 
weeks to appoint a blue-ribbon task force to make recommendations on state 
transportation financing. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) said one 
issue that can no longer be ignored is the unreliability of gasoline taxes as a 
funding source for transportation projects. As cars become more efficient and 
use less gasoline, gas tax revenues have either held steady or risen much 
slower than projections. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergence of electric cars and other vehicles using alternative fuels in 
the future will only exacerbate the situation because they pay no gas taxes. 
"The current system isn't going to work," Katz said. "We can't just keep 
increasing the gas tax. I don't think the public has an appetite for it."

CANCER CASE IGNITES CULTURE CLASH; MEDICINE: HMONG PARENTS REFUSE TO AGREE TO 
COURT-ORDERED CHEMOTHERAPY FOR TEEN-AGE DAUGHTER. THEY FEAR TREATMENT BY 
DOCTORS WILL MAKE HER INFERTILE AND UNMARRIAGEABLE. 
</P>

<P>
 Green leaves sprinkled outside the shabby apartment by a Hmong shaman warned 
neighbors that no one but the immediate family should cross the threshold. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, Chong Chang Lor and his wife, Yia, began a three-day ritual, hoping to 
summon the good spirits this weekend to protect their 15-year-old daughter, 
Lee. The girl ran away from home three weeks ago after a Fresno judge overruled 
the family and ordered chemotherapy to treat Lee's ovarian cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The short, chunky 10th-grader filled her backpack with herbal medicine and 
Hollywood teen-idol posters and seemingly disappeared, one step ahead of 
authorities. "I don't want you guys to cry, it's not your fault," she wrote her 
parents. "If I stay, there is so much trouble for me." 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual case has unleashed passionate feelings among the tens of thousands 
of Hmong refugees who have settled in the San Joaquin Valley, and pitted their 
16th-Century tribal customs against modern American medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 When police first removed the girl from her parents' custody for an initial 
round of chemotherapy, they were pelted with stones and had to wrest a knife 
from the father, who threatened to kill himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's parents, like most Hmong who came here from the mountains of Laos, argue 
that they have the right to seek herbal and spiritual remedies for their 
daughter before opting for Western medicine -- procedures that they believe 
desecrate the soul and block reincarnation. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities now question whether Lee has run away or if the Hmong community is 
hiding her in the belief that she does not have cancer and that doctors were 
simply using her as a "guinea pig." 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents say they have not seen or heard from their oldest daughter since 
the night of Oct. 28 when she fell asleep in the living room with several of 
her eight siblings. The family shaman, a diviner of spirits who counsels Hmong 
on all matters, had a vision of Lee in an unknown location "out in the open but 
OK." 
</P>
<P>
 "This case is about a big misunderstanding," said Shur Vangyi, a liaison 
between the city of Fresno and the Hmong community. "The doctors and the social 
service people don't understand our culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Family and community leaders said Lee may have seemed a timid girl struggling 
with her high school studies, but to the Hmong community she was a prime 
candidate for marriage and motherhood -- cherished rites that would honor her 
parents and fetch a fine dowry. 
</P>
<P>
 When doctors discovered that the pain in her stomach wasn't appendicitis but 
ovarian cancer, they threatened the only future Lee knew by removing an ovary 
and Fallopian tube and ordering chemotherapy, the Hmong community felt. 
</P>
<P>
 At the upcoming Hmong New Year, where boys and girls will toss balls to each 
other in a colorful act of courtship, a bald and infertile Lee would be 
considered damaged goods. "Maybe her hair will grow back, but her fertility, 
that is gone," Vangyi said. "And if she cannot have children, she will not have 
that worthiness." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities acknowledge that they may have underestimated the fervency of the 
fertility issue in the Lor case. It is a highly charged question in the Hmong 
community, where the average family such as the Lors receives welfare and 
numbers nine children, one of the highest fertility rates in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors at Valley Children's Hospital said they informed the Lors that the 
surgery would only slightly decrease their daughter's ability to conceive a 
child and that chemotherapy would have temporary side effects but no long-term 
effects on her reproductive life. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Lors were never completely assuaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "At 12 years old, Hmong girls begin to marry," said Cheng Vang, Lee's uncle 
and the family spokesman. "When the parents find out that they removed ovary 
and not just appendix, they didn't trust the doctors anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Stephenson, a pediatric oncologist at the hospital, said the surgeon 
had no choice once the eight-inch tumor was found. "It was a matter of life and 
death," the doctor said. "To do otherwise would have been malpractice." 
</P>
<P>
 Two decades after the first Hmong arrived here from refugee camps in Thailand, 
authorities have grown familiar with the challenges of absorbing a proud and 
sometimes defiant people with almost no modern skills. Until missionaries 
converged on their mountain huts three decades ago, the Hmong had no written 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 While growing numbers are attending college and entering the professions, the 
vast majority of the 30,000 Hmong in Fresno County are basically lost in 
America and mired in welfare dependency. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the refugees regard welfare as their due for serving as an underground 
force in the CIA's secret war against the Viet Cong in the early 1970s, 
officials say. Nearly 70% of the Hmong receive Aid to Families with Dependent 
Children, the highest welfare rate of any ethnic group in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to reduce that number through job training and workfare programs have 
been met with deep resistance and even death threats. "I've had to carry a gun, 
and we've had some caseworkers whose houses have been shot at," said Ernest 
Velasquez, head of Fresno County social services. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hmong say, 'This is my check. The CIA promised me this check.' We're 
talking about a second generation of welfare recipients who weren't even alive 
during the Vietnam War." 
</P>
<P>
 The clash of cultures resounds everywhere here. Only a few funeral homes will 
accommodate the Hmong, who chant over their dead for three days and burn paper 
money and slaughter chickens and sometimes cattle in the parking lot for a 
departing feast. One funeral home burned to the ground a few years ago in the 
midst of high mourning. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have undertaken education programs to dissuade Hmong men from 
kidnaping young teens to be their brides and from growing opium. Fresno police 
have hired several Hmong officers to help bridge language and cultural gaps. 
</P>
<P>
 But the issue of caring for sick and crippled children has continued to vex 
officials. Because the Hmong worship their ancestors, there is a belief that 
diseases and handicaps are the sins of a dead relative being visited on a new 
generation or the sins of a child's past life. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Hmong have allowed American doctors to treat their children once a shaman 
has performed the proper Hmong ceremonies. At Valley Children's Hospital, for 
instance, shamans are allowed to burn incense and perform small rituals with 
water in a patient's room. 
</P>
<P>
 "We treat them like any other priest," said Cris Monahan-Bremer, the hospital 
spokeswoman. "Last year, we saw 5,300 Southeast Asian patients and there was 
rarely a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, nine Hmong children died of measles after their parents consulted 
with shamans and waited until the children were in cardiac arrest before 
bringing them into the hospital. That same year, in a highly publicized case, a 
Hmong family went to court to stop doctors from surgically repairing their 
son's clubfeet. Ultimately, a judge ruled that the handicap was not severe 
enough to remove the child from the home and force surgery against the parents' 
will. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike that boy, officials point out, Lee Lor needed to begin chemotherapy 
within weeks of her Sept. 26 cancer surgery or her chances of survival would 
drop from 80% to 10%. But the Lors say they don't believe the numbers or even 
that Lee suffers from cancer, a word that does not exist in their language. 
</P>
<P>
 They say they will never trust American doctors again, not after being told 
that their daughter suffered appendicitis only to discover -- three days after 
the surgery -- that one of her ovaries and a Fallopian tube were gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital and welfare officials, including two Hmong translators, say the 
family was informed of the cancer right after the surgery. Velasquez, the head 
of county social services which sought and won the court order forcing 
chemotherapy, acknowledged that officials might have done a better job 
communicating with Hmong leaders and the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we could have avoided some of this mess if we had done a better job 
paving the way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lors say their daughter ran away from home once before. Last summer, angry 
that she couldn't stay out later, she disappeared for a few days. She called 
from a local hospital with a bad headache. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a nice girl," said her 16-year-old cousin, Angie Vang. "She always says 
she wants to go to Los Angeles. I think she was just afraid that if she didn't 
have any hair, everyone would make fun of her."

REBEL MUSLIMS, SERBS ATTACK BOSNIAN SOLDIERS IN BIHAC; BALKANS: RENEGADE FORCES 
TRY TO RECAPTURE LOST TERRITORY BEFORE U.N. HAS A CHANCE TO LAUNCH AIR STRIKES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Renegade Muslim forces and Serbs attacked government soldiers Sunday in 
northwest Bosnia, apparently trying to recapture lost territory before the 
United Nations could react. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior U.N. officials met in Zagreb, Croatia, to consider using NATO warplanes 
to attack Serbian forces under expanded powers granted Saturday by the U.N. 
Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Times reported in today's editions that North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization warplanes were ready to bomb a Serb-controlled airfield in Croatia 
on Sunday but were forced to call off the attack because of bad weather. The 
Times quoted unidentified Western officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Government troops in Bihac, in northwestern Bosnia-Herzegovina, were under 
attack by renegade Muslim forces and rebel Serbs, according to the United 
Nations. Serbian artillery in neighboring Croatia was firing across the border 
at the government forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebel Serbs captured the waterworks for Bihac, a city of 48,000 people, giving 
them control of the water supply, said U.N. sources, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 The assaults reflected the determination of the Serbs and of Muslims loyal to 
warlord Fikret Abdic to cripple the government army, which defeated Abdic in 
August and broke through Serbian lines in a stunning advance last month. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. official in Zagreb earlier reported heavy fighting around Velika 
Kladusa, Abdic's former headquarters near Bihac. Government forces there are 
surrounded, and the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the 
Abdic forces appeared to have the upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The official HINA news agency of Croatia reported the "whole border between 
Bosnia and Croatia is on fire . . . under joint attack by the Abdic forces and 
Bosnian Serb forces." It said they were supported by artillery and tanks firing 
from Serb-held Croatian territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, who recently has become an ally of Bosnia's 
Muslim-led government, invited the United Nations on Friday to bomb rebel Serbs 
in his country to stop the cross-border attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 In Batnoga, Croatia, just across the border from Velika Kladusa, refugees who 
fled with Abdic in August were waiting on Saturday to return. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each shell means our return home is closer," said Minka Hadzic while 
listening to explosions from the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Security Council has given U.N. commanders authority to call in NATO 
warplanes to protect "safe areas" such as Bihac from attack. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the council expanded that to allow NATO warplanes to bomb rebel 
Serb forces in neighboring Croatia if they launch attacks against Bosnian

 Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic demanded air strikes against the rebel 
Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is critical around Bihac right now, and we're waiting for the response of 
the U.N. and NATO immediately," said Silajdzic after a meeting with U.S. 
Ambassador Victor Jackovich. 
</P>
<P>
 The top U.N. official in the region, Yasushi Akashi, and the military 
commander, Gen. Bertrand de Lapresle, met in Zagreb and issued a statement 
condemning "cross-border and military activity from Serb-held Croatia." 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. sources in Sarajevo said that, if De Lapresle orders air attacks, his 
priority is to knock out the Serbian airstrip at Udbina in Croatia. It was used 
to attack Bihac on Friday and the nearby town of Cazin on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in Bihac, but nine people were killed and 15 wounded in 
Cazin. One of two warplanes attacking Cazin crashed, killing its pilot, 
according to U.N. officials. 
</P>
<P>
 French officials say De Lapresle requested a NATO attack Friday but was turned 
down because the Security Council had yet to give permission to bomb in 
Croatia.

WASHINGTON OUTLOOK: REPUBLICANS MUST NEGOTIATE PARADOXICAL SET OF PITFALLS; 
WITH GINGRICH AT THE HELM, THE GOP ASCENDANCE PROMPTS DEBATE ABOUT THE ROLE OF 
GOVERNMENT; PARTY RISKS GOING TOO FAR OR NOT FAR ENOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Near a microphone, incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) has a weakness 
for both cyber-babble and the lacerating one-liner that leaves just a trace of 
blood on his own lips. But he can also be refreshingly direct: "My challenge to 
the American people is real simple," he declared in his first speech after the 
GOP landslide earlier this month. "You really want to dramatically reduce power 
in Washington? You have to be willing to take more responsibility back home." 
</P>
<P>
 With Gingrich at the helm, the Republican ascendance should prompt the most 
fundamental debate about government's role since at least the New Deal. In 
Gingrich (and such like-minded allies as Texas Sen. Phil Gramm), liberals face 
opponents much more tenacious and committed than Ronald Reagan to radically 
reducing Washington's reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, as they scurried across the capital last week from television studio 
to news conference -- as if taking an electronic victory lap -- GOP luminaries 
like Gingrich and Gramm, former Education Secretary William J. Bennett and 
party strategist William Kristol all presented the election as a historic 
referendum on the federal government. The Republican sweep, Kristol said, 
marked "the end of the New Deal era" in a precise way: It signified that 
Americans finally had concluded that new programs from Washington could not 
solve the nation's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristol has a good case for reading a strong mandate in the election results. 
The only way to deny the ideological content is to assume that no one in 
America listened to anything the candidates said. Virtually every Republican 
candidate this year ran on the same three-legged message: one part Reagan 
(smaller government), another Ross Perot (congressional and political reform), 
and a third Bill Bennett (values, virtue and tough love for the poor). 
</P>
<P>
 With that appeal overwhelming all Democratic defenses, the election 
represented a decisive victory for the decades-long GOP project of shifting 
populist discontent away from its historic targets of the rich and big business 
toward government (and, to a slightly lesser extent, an underclass portrayed as 
violent and welfare-dependent). In a survey immediately after the election, 
veteran GOP pollster Richard B. Wirthlin found that three-fourths of Americans 
now agree with Reagan's classic contention that government is not the solution 
to our problems; government is the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 That strong statement of dissatisfaction with Washington gives the Republicans 
a lot of rope for the coming months. But they could still hang themselves with 
it, if they are no more successful than President Clinton at negotiating a 
paradoxical set of pitfalls: the risks that they will go too far, and not far 
enough, in pursuit of their agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side, Republicans can be undermined by not going far enough in pursuit 
of wasteful spending for fear of offending powerful Republican-leaning 
interests -- the same way Clinton's support from public-employee unions, 
teachers and social workers has blunted his knife in some arenas. Already 
Kristol's call for placing agricultural subsidies on the block has drawn howls 
from farm state Republicans such as incoming Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole of 
Kansas. Kristol might also have mentioned an entire panoply of other 
inefficient subsidies to industries with the same claim on the GOP that 
public-employee unions exert on the Democrats -- from Western ranchers to 
mining, timber and energy companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond those narrow subsidies stands the biggest sacred cow in the barnyard: 
entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and government pensions 
that are driving the deficit (by 2004 mandatory spending will constitute 
two-thirds of the federal budget) but have become woven into the fabric of 
middle-class life. Unless Republicans are willing to tug on that thread, they 
will never come close to fulfilling their core promise of a balanced budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The risk on the other side is that reformist Republicans will go too far in 
pursuing their vision of the ideal state. In his first two years, Clinton's 
single biggest mistake was seeking to reify, in one great leap, his panoramic 
revelation of the perfect health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the same hubris is infecting GOP plans for welfare. In pushing for 
benefit cutoffs that could force substantial numbers of poor women to abandon 
their children to orphanages, the House GOP leaders ultimately could face the 
same dynamic that did in Clinton's health care plan: However much the problem 
worries Americans, they may end up fearing the solution even more. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare points up another critical choice facing Republicans as they try to 
imagine a post-New Deal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Most House Republicans want to "solve" welfare in Washington, with stern 
nationally established time limits and benefit reductions. But a minority 
insists that setting such inflexible federal rules violates conservative 
principles; they would rather devolve welfare to local governments -- perhaps 
in a swap where the federal government would assume the full cost of Medicaid 
and give states total freedom to run welfare, food stamps and infant-nutrition 
programs. If Republicans try to redesign welfare from Washington, says Sen. 
Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.), who has proposed such a swap, "we'll weave 
ourselves right back into the same web." 
</P>
<P>
 But any divisions between Republicans on reforming government pale beside the 
gulf with Clinton. The President also wants to reinvent government -- but so 
that it can take on new tasks or perform old ones with new vigor. Clinton's 
philosophical foundation remains the belief that government can serve "as a 
catalyst to empower people to make more of their own lives" through programs 
that link opportunity and responsibility, like his national service plan. "We 
cannot get very far in this country thinking our government is intrinsically 
bad and always makes things worse," he said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 As shown in a post-election survey by his own pollster, Stanley B. Greenberg, 
Clinton fatally obscured his reform message by pushing the Brobdingnagian 
health care plan. That failure has immeasurably complicated his task of 
convincing ordinary Americans that government can be reformed to work for them; 
Clinton will have an even tougher time marshaling evidence for that case in the 
next two years because congressional Republicans are likely to choke off funds 
for potentially popular new initiatives like national service. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Republicans may also find their argument more difficult to sell as the 
debate moves from the popular abstraction of limiting government to the 
thornier details of reducing specific programs and protections. One early 
signpost: An election-night survey of voters found strong demand for deficit 
reduction -- but majority support for just four of 25 options for blotting the 
red ink. While resisting new programs, the public also resists changes in the 
old. 
</P>
<P>
 As Gingrich forthrightly acknowledges, less government will mean more 
responsibility for individual Americans. But does that mean Americans will have 
more personal responsibility for the health care costs of aging parents, or 
ferreting out dangerous chemicals at work, or contributing more of their money 
and time to charitable organizations flooded with poor families denied public 
assistance? The election ensures a renewed drive for government reform; but 
until Americans sign off on the fine print in the Republican plan, it's too 
early to say that Gingrich's vision alone will guide the process. What Would 
You Cut? 
</P>
<P>
 Voters want Washington slimmed down. But when it comes to most specific 
proposals for reducing the deficit support drops:

PALESTINIANS LONG TO END LAWLESSNESS; MIDEAST: WITH THE OCCUPIED WEST BANK IN 
LIMBO, HOPES FOR CIVIL ORDER HAVE BEEN SHAKEN BY ACTIONS OF ARMED YOUTHS ACTING 
IN THE NAME OF THE PLO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For Palestinians living in the West Bank's largest city, what started as a 
minor traffic accident has become a metaphor for the lawlessness engulfing 
their society as they await the Palestine Liberation Organization's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 At noon on Oct. 29, Sami Tayyem -- a bodyguard hired to work in the PLO's 
Nablus office -- and nine of his friends stormed into the local office of the 
National Insurance Co. All were armed, according to witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 What followed played like a scene from a Western movie: After ordering the 
firm's terrified employees into the street, Tayyem and his friends trained 
their guns on the office's computers and other equipment. By the time the 
shooting stopped, the office was a shambles. An estimated $7,000 in damage had 
been done. 
</P>
<P>
 Tayyem launched the attack, witnesses said, because the insurer had failed to 
immediately pay a claim he filed for a minor car accident that had occurred two 
days before. Damage to his car was estimated at $100. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident caused an uproar here, home to some of the West Bank's largest, 
wealthiest families and a city known for its strong support of the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 "Such actions not only damage the image of those who committed the crime but 
also does damage to the Palestinian people and their leadership," the insurer 
raged in an advertisement it ran in the Arabic press. "The National Co. does 
not denounce the action because that brings no results. However, it does, with 
great sorrow, mourn the death of morals, ethics and principles." 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a miserable action," said Said Kanaan, a Nablus businessman close to 
the PLO. "But it was not the first such miserable action to occur here, and it 
is not the last that will occur." 
</P>
<P>
 What horrified residents here was not only the violence but that it was 
committed by gunmen hired by the PLO. The same people who attacked the 
insurance firm presumably will be among those enforcing the law in Nablus once 
PLO authority is extended throughout the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bullets used to damage our office should be used for the security and 
protection of our people, and these young men should be the guardians of law 
and order -- not chaos and disorder," the company admonished in its ad. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Nablus residents say, civil order in their community has been 
steadily deteriorating. It started to decline, they say, with the 1987 eruption 
of the intifada, the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation. After the 
intifada began, Palestinian police who worked under Israeli authority in the 
West Bank quit what suddenly had become dishonorable jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Since they departed, Palestinians in the territories have gotten by with no 
formal agency to deal with common crimes. Palestinians tried various means to 
maintain social order. They formed popular committees and gave traditional 
tribal law a greater role. Gradually -- and reluctantly -- they came to rely on 
groups of armed youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vacuum started with the resignation of the policemen and the creation of 
a social state of civil disobedience against Israeli rule," said Amin Makbool, 
a senior PLO official in Nablus. "The community started to use the 
organizations of the intifada youth to enforce law. But sometimes, the youth 
made mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 One prominent Nablus businessman observed, "It is ridiculous: People turn to 
16-year-olds to settle their disputes, because those are the ones who are 
armed." 
</P>
<P>
 With the 1993 signing of the Israeli-PLO framework for peace, however, people 
began to look forward to a restoration of services, including police 
protection. They thought that Arafat would move to curb the aggressive behavior 
of some of the Fatah activists. 
</P>
<P>
 But those expectations have been shaken by the conduct of youths acting in the 
name of Fatah, the largest PLO faction, in Nablus and other West Bank towns. 
The PLO opened several offices in Nablus, including the one where Tayyem landed 
a job. Initially, the offices were meant to establish a political presence for 
the PLO in the northern West Bank. But soon they were swamped with requests to 
intervene in civil disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 "People came to the offices to solve problems, and the offices responded," 
Makbool said. "That was a mistake, because the people working in the offices 
didn't have experience in this field. Problems accumulated." 
</P>
<P>
 Nablus residents said they complained to PLO officials, even to Chairman 
Yasser Arafat, about the employees. But the PLO leader, beset with problems in 
Gaza, did nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Tayyem decided to take matters into his own hands with the National 
Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat reportedly was so embarrassed by the attack on the Nablus insurer that 
he ordered the PLO office here temporarily closed. The PLO promised that Tayyem 
and his fellow gunmen will be punished. But residents here say that no action 
has been taken. Makbool insisted in an interview that the Palestinian Authority 
will move against Tayyem and the others, but he could not say how or when. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident cast doubt on Arafat's ability to provide Palestinians a sense of 
personal security -- the one area where even his harshest Palestinian critics 
give him credit for performing well in the Gaza Strip, seat of the Palestinian 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime is said to be down in Gaza; Gazans feel safe walking their streets, even 
late at night. But Arafat's rule extends only throughout Gaza and to the tiny 
West Bank town of Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 In the rest of the West Bank, Palestinians are still living under Israeli 
military control; Arafat has allowed the informal groups of youths to continue 
roaming the streets, often with weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever there is a time of uncertainty, the guns that people have stashed 
under their floorboards begin to come out," said one official in the Israeli 
civil administration. "That is what we are seeing in Nablus and in other parts 
of the West Bank." 
</P>
<P>
 Talks between Israel and the PLO on extending Palestinian authority throughout 
the West Bank are scheduled to resume in Cairo by the end of this month. But no 
one expects them to yield quick results. Optimists in both camps say an Israeli 
redeployment out of Palestinian population centers and the hand-over of 
authority to the Palestinians may occur next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves the estimated 1 million Palestinians of the West Bank living in 
political, economic and social limbo until then. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinians say that the knowledge that the Israeli military's days in the 
West Bank are numbered, coupled with the absence of a real Palestinian 
authority, has created a dangerous power vacuum. For now, undisciplined thugs 
are the only ones around to fill it. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is no shortage of thugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel has released thousands of Palestinian prisoners in keeping with 
agreements signed with the PLO. Most have made their way back to homes in the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip. But many have found that the society they left years 
ago no longer has space for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these people are old freedom fighters," said Zuhair a-Dibi, himself a 
former prisoner and now the editor of a Nablus newspaper. "They have no 
education, no skills, no jobs. They were heroes during the intifada. Then they 
spent years in prison. Now they feel that they have no part in the political 
developments that are going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli officials deny they are ignoring the problem but say their hands are 
full dealing with security issues that affect Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is also true that when Nablus Mayor Ghassan Shakka recently declared 
that the municipality wanted to hire and deploy 100 police to deal with the 
city's monumental traffic and parking problems, the civil administration 
blocked the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 No police can be deployed under Palestinian authority in the West Bank, the 
civil administration said, until security arrangements are negotiated between 
Israel and the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are not allowed a police force to deal with traffic, how can we deal 
with armed gangsters?" Shakka asked. The mayor said he is so frustrated by 
Nablus' deterioration, and his inability to do anything about it, that he is 
considering resigning. That would leave Nablus still waiting for Arafat to tame 
the growing chaos in its streets.

ANGOLA PEACE TREATY SIGNED, BUT LONG CONFLICT CONTINUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Repeating a ritual that twice has failed to end their 19-year-old civil war, 
Angola's government and rightist rebels signed a peace treaty Sunday as 
fighting raged on in their devastated homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi and President Jose Eduardo dos Santos did not put 
their own names on the treaty, heightening fears that it would not stop the 
war. The rebel leader did not even attend the signing ceremony; aides said he 
could not leave his bush camp in Angola because of government attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Onlookers including African heads of state cheered as the treaty was signed by 
Angolan Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura and UNITA Gen. Eugenio Manuvakola in 
a hot, crowded conference center in Lusaka, the Zambian capital. Dos Santos 
watched. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as they were declaring peace, their war continued. Fighting was reported 
in central and northern Angola, and aid workers said the rebel-held northern 
city of Uige was besieged. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of Sunday's signing also made it far from certain that the two 
sides will stick to the treaty. They have in previous years declared a 
cease-fire in November, when the rainy season makes troop movements and air 
raids impossible, only to resume fighting when the weather improved. 
</P>
<P>
 Angola's war erupted on the eve of independence from Portugal in 1975 and 
became a Cold War battlefield. Soviet weapons and Cuban troops poured into the 
Marxist government's arsenal to fight UNITA rebels armed by the United States 
and South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 500,000 people have been killed -- 80,000 of them in the battle last 
year for the central city of Huambo -- and fighting has pushed the oil- and 
diamond-rich country on Africa's southwestern coast to the brink of starvation. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the treaty, a permanent cease-fire is to take effect Tuesday. A truce 
was declared last week, but fighting went on. The rebels said all their 
airfields were under attack Saturday, but the government denied violating the 
truce. 
</P>
<P>
 "All Angolans should forget the suffering of the Angolan conflict and face the 
future with solidarity and trust," Manuvakola, the UNITA general, said after 
signing the peace treaty. Then he embraced De Moura and Dos Santos. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Dos Santos: "We are putting the national interests above party 
rivalries." 
</P>
<P>
 But Angolans were subdued and skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only with the signatures of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and the leader 
of the rebels Jonas Savimbi will the cease-fire be respected," the official 
Jornal de Angola newspaper said in a front-page article. 
</P>
<P>
 At the signing ceremony, the flags of more than 20 African nations ringed the 
table.

39% JUMP BAIL OR GET REARRESTED BEFORE TRIAL, STUDY SAYS; CRIME: THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT LOOK AT STATE COURTS FOUND THAT 63% OF DEFENDANTS ARE RELEASED PRIOR 
TO COURT DATE. FIGURES MIRROR EARLIER COUNTS. 
</P>

<P>
 More than a third of felony defendants in state courts released prior to trial 
in 1992 were arrested for a new offense or failed to appear in court, according 
to a study released today by the Justice Department. One of every 12 of the 
defendants who absconded before trial was still missing a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 The study's results, drawn from a sample of felony cases in state courts in 
May, 1992, found that an estimated 63% of all felony defendants were released 
on their own recognizance, on bail or with some other conditions. Of those 
released before trial, an estimated 14% committed new offenses and 25% had a 
bench warrant issued for their arrest because they did not appear in court as 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings, which are consistent with previous surveys, are likely to 
provide fodder for critics of the criminal justice system. But despite 
pervasive public fear of crime, criminologists said few options are available 
to dramatically improve the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are scary statistics," said Gerald M. Caplan, dean of McGeorge Law 
School in Sacramento and a former director of the National Institute of 
Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason they are scary is that there is no remedy in sight. This is 
analogous to a number of other crime-control problems: We can identify the 
problem, but we don't have a recipe to solve it." 
</P>
<P>
 Caplan said constitutional limits on pretrial detention combined with jail 
crowding leave judges few alternatives to such releases. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, Pretrial Release of Felony Defendants, was conducted by Brian A. 
Reaves and Jacob Perez, statisticians at the Bureau of Justice Statistics. They 
tracked a sample representing 55,246 men and women charged with a felony during 
May, 1992, in the nation's 75 most populous counties, which account for almost 
50% of all reported crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers found that judges were far more likely to grant pretrial 
releases to defendants who had committed less-serious crimes and had no prior 
criminal record or history of failing to appear for court appearances. While 
only 6% of all felony defendants were held without bail, for instance, 40% of 
all murder defendants were so detained. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, 27% of those released before trial had at least one felony 
conviction, including 9% who had a prior conviction for a violent felony. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, 
Pa., said that unless "there's a reasonable presumption that the individual 
will flee," the Constitution guarantees a "right to release under some kind of 
reasonable bail." 
</P>
<P>
 Blumstein added: "The presumed reason for pretrial release under the 
presumption of innocence is that the individual will appear for trial. There's 
no question that bail-setters take some account of the likelihood that the 
individual will commit a crime while awaiting trial. These decisions are always 
short of perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 Another criminal justice expert said there is wide variation among courts in 
their success with pretrial release programs. He said some courts do better 
than others by carefully deciding which defendants to release and by providing 
conscientious supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings indicate little change from surveys done in previous years. The 
overall pretrial release rate was 66% in 1988 and 65% in 1990. The 
failure-to-appear rate has also remained constant at about a quarter of those 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage of released felony defendants who were rearrested before trial 
decreased slightly from a rate of 18% in 1988 and 1990 to 14% in 1992.

GRADUATION RATE FOR BLACKS UP; NUMBERS STEADY FOR WHITES, LATINOS

<P>
 More black youngsters are finishing high school than in the past, while 
graduation rates are holding steady for whites and Latinos, the Census Bureau 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 About 75% of African American students completed high school in 1993, the 
bureau said in a report.That was up from 67% two decades earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 During the same period, graduation rates remained unchanged for whites, at 
83%, and Latinos, 61%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although the difference in the high school completion rates is narrowing 
between African Americans and whites, and college enrollments are improving for 
both groups, the gap in college enrollment has not decreased," said census 
statistician Rosalind Bruno. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it seems to have grown. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, about 42% of white high school graduates were enrolled in college, 
compared to 33% of blacks. Twenty years earlier, the difference was only six 
percentage points, 30% of whites and 24% of blacks. Between 1973 and 1993, the 
percentage of Latinos enrolled in college rose from 29% to 36%.

STRANGE NOISES REPORTED BY PASSENGERS ON EARLIER LEG OF FATAL USAIR FLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At least three passengers on an earlier leg of USAir Flight 427 complained of 
strange noises before the jet took off on its final, fatal flight, a lawyer 
representing victims' families said. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip H. Corboy, a lawyer suing USAir on behalf of some of the families, said 
reports of complaints were filed Thursday in depositions in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
 The three passengers said they had heard an odd noise during the Sept. 8 
flight from Charlotte, N.C., to Chicago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The jet left Chicago for Pittsburgh, Pa., later that day and crashed a few 
miles from the Pittsburgh airport, killing all 132 people aboard. Investigators 
have not determined the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 The type of noise the passengers said they heard was not detailed in the 
depositions. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir's chief maintenance foreman in Chicago, Gerald E. Fox, was told about a 
report of unusual noise but allowed the plane to take off without investigating 
because the pilot told him the craft was fine, USAir spokesman Richard 
Weintraub said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox is a defendant in the lawsuit filed by Corboy on behalf of some victims' 
families, along with USAir and Boeing Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Weintraub said the jet had two routine preflight checks before taking off for 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Sunday, USAir announced it has hired a retired commander of U.S. air 
forces in Europe to become the airline's new vice president of corporate 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert C. Oaks, 58, left his military post earlier this year, ending a 35-year 
career. He also is a former chief of the Air Force's training organization, the 
Air Training Command. He starts Dec. 1.

WEAKENED STORM ZIGZAGS BACK TOWARD FLORIDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The long-lived, erratic storm known as Gordon zigzagged back to Florida on 
Sunday as a dwindling weather system, nothing like the hurricane and tropical 
storm blamed for hundreds of deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4 p.m. EST, the depression was centered 85 miles east of Cape Canaveral.It 
was moving west at 11 m.p.h. and was expected to continue weakening. 
</P>
<P>
 Its strongest winds were about 30 m.p.h., down from its peak of 80 m.p.h. 
after reaching hurricane strength last week off the coast of North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon formed Nov. 8 off Nicaragua, zigzagged east through the Caribbean as a 
tropical storm, and snaked west alongside the Florida Keys and then northeast 
across the Florida Peninsula. Once in the Atlantic, it strengthened and headed 
north to North Carolina, then reversed course.

POST-ELECTION TURMOIL GRIPS DEMOCRATIC PARTY FROM TOP TO BOTTOM; POLITICS: EGOS 
AND INTEREST GROUPS ARE AT ODDS ON LONGTIME PRINCIPLES. TALK GROWS OF A 
CHALLENGE TO CLINTON FROM WITHIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SHOGAN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Democratic Party's midterm election debacle has touched off a far-ranging 
struggle over the party's future, even as its leaders strive to keep the 
fragile Democratic coalition together. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving the conflict in part are the clashing ambitions of individual 
politicians and the concerns of competing interest groups. But the main bone of 
contention is how much the Democrats can still rely on the principle that has 
been their cornerstone for more than 50 years: the power of activist government 
to solve the nation's problems and win electoral support. 
</P>
<P>
 Skirmish lines are being formed from Capitol Hill, where key leadership posts 
are being contested, to the grass roots, where liberal activists are striving 
either to find ways to prod President Clinton into shifting to the left or to 
find some champion to oppose his reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined effect of these confrontations, along with the actions of the 
President himself, will go a long way to determining whether the Democrats in 
1996 will recover the ground they lost this month or fall even further behind 
the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the party's hierarchy is trying to curb potentially divisive debate 
about the election's implications. "We can't afford to dwell on what should 
have been or what could have been," newly anointed Democratic National 
Committee Chairwoman Debra DeLee, told state party leaders gathered last week 
in Orlando, Fla. "And don't even think about pointing fingers." 
</P>
<P>
 But it is not just the issue of blame for the outcome on Nov. 8 -- which New 
Mexico Rep. Bill Richardson labeled in Orlando as "a day that will live in 
infamy" -- that now agitates the Democrats. They are more concerned about 
finding a way to combat the post-election Republican ideological assault, 
spearheaded by House Speaker-to-be Newt Gingrich and designed to exploit the 
GOP's huge Election Day gains by redefining the national political agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the Republicans) are just riding roughshod over us," fumed the chief 
aide to a leading Eastern Democratic senator. "They defined the last six months 
of the campaign and if we give them a long enough leash here, we'll be in a 
hole so big we won't be able to get out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some who believe that the President has drifted too far to the left argue that 
he should take a few steps to the right. "The message we were broadcasting for 
the most part is that we're there for the have-nots but we're not there for the 
haves,' " California Democratic Chairman Bill Press said in an interview. "And 
the haves voted and the have-nots didn't. So we're perceived, I'm afraid, as 
the party of African Americans, the party of Latinos, the party of women, the 
party of gays. But we're not the party of white working men and women anymore 
and the middle class." 
</P>
<P>
 To change that perception, Press said "we have to reshape our agenda and 
stress the issues that appeal to the haves, like welfare reform and maybe some 
marginal kind of health reform, but no big, global thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Press' views echoed the findings of another shot fired in the ideological 
struggle, a post-election poll released last week by the Democratic Leadership 
Council, the centrist group Clinton headed before he ran for President. 
</P>
<P>
 Council President Al From said the survey, conducted by Stanley B. Greenberg, 
Clinton's own pollster, demonstrated that Clinton and the Democrats were badly 
damaged by the President's health care reform plan because voters saw it as a 
symbol of big government. "Clinton needs to stay away from big government 
programs" to save himself and his party from further harm in 1996, From warned. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Democrats see the Clinton presidency and the future of their party in 
almost diametrically opposite terms. "There is a mantra that Clinton went wrong 
because he was too liberal," said Jeff Cohen, a longtime activist in New York 
Democratic politics and director of FAIR, an organization that monitors media 
treatment of public-interest and minority viewpoints. "But I know a lot of 
people who believe he campaigned against Reaganomics, but when he started 
governing, he started waffling." 
</P>
<P>
 At a Manhattan forum sponsored by the liberal Fund for New Priorities to 
develop "a progressive agenda" for the next Congress, Cohen complained that 
"Clinton has given up on the idea of investing in the future" and argued that 
"Democrats have to have a program that talks about jobs" as a way of persuading 
a public skeptical about federal programs that government can make a positive 
difference in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Another forum participant, Frances Fox Piven, City University of New York 
political scientist and author of "Why Americans Don't Vote," argued that 
instead of worrying about why they did not get support from a larger share of 
the 38% of voting-age Americans who cast their ballots, the Democrats would be 
better off if they concentrated on going after the 60% who were non-voters by 
trying to improve the plight of low-income citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, liberals and other discontented Democrats are also talking about 
supporting a candidate who would challenge Clinton for the Democratic 
nomination or possibly run on a third-party ticket, with the Rev. Jesse 
Jackson's name most often mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a huge amount of pressure" from local labor leaders and black 
community activists to get Jackson to run, according to a former Jackson 
presidential campaign aide. He notes that a recent poll by the Joint Center for 
Political Studies, a think tank that focuses on black politics, indicated that 
50% of black voters would support an independent black presidential candidacy, 
even though Clinton stands fairly well in the black community. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Democrat mentioned as a possible rival to Clinton in 1996 is Nebraska 
Sen. Bob Kerrey, who sought the 1992 nomination and was reelected this month to 
his second term. Speculation about a Kerrey candidacy heightened after the Nov. 
8 vote when the senator described the results as a "repudiation" of Clinton's 
first two years in office. 
</P>
<P>
 The very idea of an intraparty fight for the nomination is enough to drive 
most established Democratic leaders to distraction. "The American people think 
that if you can't run your own party in an orderly manner, why should they 
expect that you can run the country," said longtime Texas party Chairman Robert 
Slagle. 
</P>
<P>
 But that attitude could change, according to an aide of a top Democratic House 
leader. "They (Democratic House members) want to give Clinton five or six 
months to see how he does," the aide said. "If he stays where he is or goes 
down in the polls, he's going to be in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 For the time being, Democratic House members have their own internal contests 
for leadership posts to think about. North Carolina Rep. Charlie Rose, a 
moderate running for minority leader against liberal Rep. Richard A. Gephardt 
of Missouri, praised parts of the Republican "contract with America," which 
Gephardt has denounced as "extremist." And Texas Rep. Charles W. Stenholm, a 
staunch conservative challenging liberal House Whip David E. Bonior of 
Michigan, called for Democrats in the House to make a change in direction to 
the right. 
</P>
<P>
 To balance things out, Rep. Vic Fazio of West Sacramento, another liberal, 
must compete for reelection as chairman of the House Democratic Caucus against 
Maryland Rep. Kweisi Mfume, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus who 
at times has criticized Clinton for not being liberal enough. 
</P>
<P>
 While all three challengers are viewed as long shots at best, analysts say 
just the fact that they are running for the posts is evidence of the turbulence 
shaking the world's oldest political party from top to bottom.

DAVID CROSBY GETS LIVER TRANSPLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rock musician David Crosby was in critical but stable condition Sunday after 
undergoing a seven-hour liver transplant operation, said a spokesman for UCLA 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pleased with the way Mr. Crosby's surgery proceeded," said Dr. Ronald 
W. Busuttil, director of the Dumont-UCLA Liver Transplant Center and Crosby's 
surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
 "As with all transplant patients, we will watch his progress closely for 
several days and I am optimistic that he will do well," Busuttil said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crosby, 53, is a member of the seminal Crosby, Stills and Nash rock group, 
which formed shortly before the original Woodstock concert in the summer of 
1969. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio also played at the 25th anniversary concert this past summer. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of success, Crosby, who struggled with drug addiction, hit a low 
point in 1985. He spent nearly a year behind bars in Texas in 1985 on drug and 
weapons charges. 
</P>
<P>
 He was hospitalized on Nov. 5 for liver failure. He recently experienced what 
was described as a moderate decline in his condition, and the call went out for 
donors to supply blood for the operation.

MOTORIST FLEEING POLICE KILLED IN FREEWAY CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The southbound Pasadena Freeway was closed until early Sunday morning after a 
spectacular crash that killed a motorist fleeing Los Angeles police. 
</P>
<P>
 A police cruiser responding to a family dispute arrived at an apartment 
building near the Avenue 52 entrance to the freeway around 9:30 p.m., Sgt. Jack 
Sommers said.As the cruiser pulled up, officers saw a pickup truck leaving the 
front of the building. When they called to the driver to halt, Sommers said, he 
rammed the cruiser, and sped onto the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Pursuing police "were not doing anything near the speed of this guy," Sommers 
said, and when the pickup neared the Avenue 43 entrance, the speeding driver 
slid into the passenger seat and was seen rummaging below the seat, keeping 
only his left hand on the steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck hit the side of the freeway and hurtled 70 feet through the air, 
slamming into a tree, Sommers said. The truck then ricocheted back onto the 
freeway, landing between two cars and turning over. The driver was ejected 
through the passenger door and was declared dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The man's name was not released.

2 MEN KILLED, GIRL WOUNDED IN SHOOTING AFTER DRAG-RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An illegal drag-race meet on an isolated road ended in the fatal shooting of 
two men and the wounding of a teen-age girl, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dedrick Gobert, 22, of Inglewood, and Ignacio Hernandez, 19, of Rosemead, were 
shot early Saturday in the unincorporated Mira Loma area, said Riverside County 
Sheriff's Investigator Mark Lohman. 
</P>
<P>
 A 16-year-old girl who was shot in the neck was in critical condition Sunday, 
Lohman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies responding to a 2:20 a.m. shooting report found Gobert and Hernandez 
dead in the roadway on Etiwanda Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Gobert, who believed that he had been cut off by another driver, had sought 
him out in the parking lot of a restaurant, Lohman said. Several people began 
beating Gobert, and Hernandez was attacked when he tried to help Gobert, Lohman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight moved into the middle of the avenue, where an attacker shot the men. 
"Then he shot a 16-year-old girl who came to their aid," Lohman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators were looking for a man believed to have fled in a dark blue, 
two-door 1993 or 1994 Honda Prelude. It had a "Hypertec Racing" decal across 
the top of the windshield, and the words "Powered by Honda Hypertec Racing" on 
the passenger seat window.

ERWIN N. GRISWOLD; FORMER SOLICITOR GENERAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Solicitor General Erwin N. Griswold, who served under Presidents Lyndon 
B. Johnson and Richard Nixon and whose more than 100 cases before the Supreme 
Court included the Pentagon Papers arguments, has died. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
 Griswold, who lived in Belmont, died Saturday at Massachusetts General 
Hospital after a brief illness. 
</P>
<P>
 His legal career spanned 65 years, more than half of them as a faculty member 
at Harvard Law School. He was dean there for 21 years before joining the 
Johnson Administration in 1967 as solicitor general, the federal government's 
top-ranking courtroom lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his death, he had argued more cases, 127, before the nation's 
highest court than any other living attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Griswold's most famous case may have come in 1971, when he argued on behalf of 
the Nixon Administration in attempting to halt publication of the so-called 
Pentagon Papers, which chronicled the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 Griswold, a liberal Republican, argued unsuccessfully that publishing the 
federal documents would "have the effect of causing immediate and irreparable 
harm to the security of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 In later years, however, Griswold said his heart hadn't been in the case 
because the federal government had little legal ground to stop the Washington 
Post and the New York Times from going to press. In hindsight, he said, 
publishing the Pentagon Papers was harmless. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Griswold had a sense of humor about the cases he lost. A plaque on his 
bookcase read: "Babe Ruth struck out 1,330 times." 
</P>
<P>
 Another major case handled by Griswold involved the 1st Amendment and the 
Johnson Administration's contention that the federal government could force 
radio and TV stations to broadcast opposing viewpoints. The Supreme Court 
agreed, and in 1969 upheld the so-called "fairness doctrine." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from his ability in the courtroom, Griswold was a noted constitutional 
scholar and champion of civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 As dean of Harvard Law School at the height of the McCarthy era, Griswold in 
1954 wrote the book, "The Fifth Amendment Today," examining the constitutional 
protection against self-incrimination and denouncing Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy led a campaign to identify supposed Communists in the government and 
in public life, ruining many careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we take these rights for granted, if we accept them as a matter of course, 
we may simply fritter them away and end up losing them, and we probably deserve 
to lose them," Griswold said in a 1954 speech included in the book.

STREET SMART: MUCH-ANTICIPATED IMPERIAL HIGHWAY EXTENSION TO OPEN SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I am writing about the extension of Imperial Highway in Anaheim Hills that 
goes over the hill and connects to Loma Street and Santiago Canyon Road in the 
city of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 This extension has been built for the last three to six months and yet has not 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
 I hear that a political official is stalling the opening of this road for some 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
 My husband and I have great need of this road and would like to see it open. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria S. Noble 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Hills 
</P>
<P>
 You and everyone else! For all the people who wrote letters to Street Smart or 
called the city of Orange inquiring about the opening of the Imperial Highway 
extension, your wait is almost over. 
</P>
<P>
 A ribbon-cutting ceremony and the extension opening are tentatively scheduled 
for mid-December, said Jim Devore, associate civil engineer for the city of 
Orange. Any last-minute snags in construction or rain could push the opening 
date back to Jan. 1 at the latest, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Even though the road looks ready, a small section still requires some 
finishing touches. A lack of funding, not a politician, was part of the reason 
behind the delay in completing the extension, Devore said.  
</P>
<P>
 Coordinating the project between the cities of Anaheim and Orange also took 
time, as did the actual construction, done in three phases by three different 
entities: Southern California Edison, the city of Anaheim and Standard Pacific, 
a developer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest segment of 1.5 miles, owned by Southern California Edison, 
involved considerable land grading, building a bridge and improvements on Loma 
Street. Also, Anaheim originally did not have the funding needed for its 
500-foot portion, Devore said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the extension opens, it will stretch from the current end of Imperial 
Highway in Anaheim to Santiago Canyon Road in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 At West Street and southbound Coast Highway in South Laguna, there is a 
left-turn signal, but no left-turn signal going north. There is also a 
crosswalk on the south side of Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't see why the left-turn signal couldn't be on at the same time the 
crosswalk signal is on. This would speed up traffic going both ways on Coast 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Thompson 
</P>
<P>
 South Laguna 
</P>
<P>
 You first need to know that West Street is a one-way street that only runs 
east. That is why there is no left-turn signal for northbound traffic on Coast 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Caltrans, allowing pedestrians to cross Highway at the same time 
southbound motorists make a left-turn onto West Street would actually slow 
things for both north and southbound Coast Highway traffic. Here's why: The 
signals on Coast Highway are set so northbound and southbound motorists always 
have top priority, said Rose Orem, a Caltrans spokeswoman. When the southbound 
Coast Highway left-turn signal is on, southbound drivers can make a left turn 
onto West Street or continue traveling south. Northbound traffic has a red 
light during this time. 
</P>
<P>
 If pedestrians were allowed to cross Coast Highway at the same time drivers 
were making their left turns onto West Street, southbound through traffic would 
have to stop. To avoid having south and north through traffic stopped at the 
same time, pedestrians must wait their turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedestrians crossing Coast Highway west to east must wait for their green 
light. I hope that clears up any confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 What can be done about the street flooding at the intersection of Harbor 
Boulevard and Sunflower Avenue in Costa Mesa? This happens every single time 
there is even a little bit of rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixie Flint 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Street flooding could be eliminated if the existing storm drain line were 
extended from South Coast Drive to the Harbor Boulevard/Sunflower Avenue 
intersection. But there are no plans for this. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa and Santa Ana share this intersection and have explored many 
options for alleviating storm runoff, including re-sloping the streets, said 
Bill Morris, city engineer for Costa Mesa. Both cities agree that an extended 
storm drain line would do the trick, but neither city has the money to pay for 
this project, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Storm drains that receive funding priority are the ones that could prevent 
flood damage to property, Morris said. Although there can be significant 
flooding at Sunflower and Harbor, there isn't any real danger of water damage 
to buildings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm drain system, installed about 15 years ago, just isn't long enough 
to reach the intersection. To extend that storm drain the needed 3,800 feet 
could cost $100 per linear foot or more, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So, for the foreseeable future at least, you might consider avoiding the 
intersection during a rainstorm. 
</P>

 Officials at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace will throw the switch on 
more than 1,000 Christmas lights tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual lighting ceremony takes place in the library's garden at 6:30 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 Although library officials decided not to light the 150-year-old pepper tree 
next to the Nixon birthplace, as has been done in the past, two smaller trees 
will have lights strung from their branches. 
</P>
<P>
 A community sing-along led by choirs from Bernardo Yorba and Travis Ranch 
middle schools will be held, and library volunteers will put on a short play. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is free and open to the public. The library is at 18001 Yorba Linda 
Blvd. Information: (714) 993-3393. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

 City officials want you to think twice before throwing away your old telephone 
directories. 
</P>
<P>
 Recycling one ton of phone books saves about 17 trees and three cubic yards of 
landfill space, according to ecology experts. 
</P>
<P>
 So cities throughout Orange County are urging residents this month to recycle 
rather than dump their old phone books when the new 1994-95 directories arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Some local trash haulers plan to give the discarded directories to paper mills 
for recycling.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: TUSTIN; FAMILY NIGHT SEEKS TO MAKE MATH FUN

<TEXT>
<P>
 How's this for family fun? Math. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Singer, a fourth-grade teacher at Marjorie Veeh Elementary School, says 
that it's possible, even for parents who hated math while they were students. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of another fourth-grade teacher, Mike Roth, Singer is 
coordinating a family math night at 7 p.m. Tuesday at the school's multipurpose 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have game-like activities that involve counting, multiplying, talking 
about strategies and learning about algebra and geometry," Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is designed to get parents involved in improving the math and 
computation skills of their children. The activities could be done by the 
family at home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer said schools that offer family math workshops have found that their 
students are enjoying math and spending more time on their homework. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 families are expected to attend the event. Child care will be 
provided. For more information, call (714) 730-7544. BERT ELJERA

HOT JOB: CROSSING GUARD LOVES WATCHING KIDS GROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOPE HAMASHIGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most people don't consider the danger involved with being a crossing guard. 
Joanne Rash, a crossing guard at the TeWinkle Middle School, said she wanted 
such a job because she thought it would be fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Rash found out just how dangerous it could be two years ago when she was hit 
by a car. She wasn't badly hurt, just a few cuts and bruises, but now she is 
more careful than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is especially hectic in the morning," she said. "Everyone is in a rush to 
get to work and they are not looking at me. They are just looking at each other 
to see who is going to go first." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Rash said, the benefits of the job outweigh the hazards. After six years 
helping kids safely cross at Gisler Avenue and California Street, she has 
become a fixture at the school and in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 She helps out the school security guards by keeping a watchful eye out for 
truant students from other schools who may try to sneak on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Rash has also made it her responsibility to keep tabs on any unusual activity 
at the houses neighboring the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is our watchdog," said Carolyn Yurada, who lives across the street from 
the junior high school. "She tells me if my dog has gotten out of the yard and 
if my kids have gotten home from school early." 
</P>
<P>
 Rash knows most of the children by name and they all greet her as they come 
and go. "I love the kids and I get to watch them grow up," she said. "That is 
the best part of this job." OCCUPATION: CROSSING GUARD 
</P>
<P>
 * What's involved: A crossing guard helps students safely cross the streets 
when they are approaching and leaving school. They also assist school security 
personnel by alerting them to fights and truant students. 
</P>
<P>
 * Qualifications: Crossing guards should enjoy working with children. They go 
through a weeklong training program to learn about safety. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: By 1998, the number of crossing guards in the county is projected 
to increase by 25% to 250. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary range: $4.25 to $8.45 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pros: Most crossing guards enjoy working outdoors and getting to know the 
children and teachers at the school where they work. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cons: Being a crossing guard can be dangerous. Drivers sometimes do not see 
them, particularly in foul weather. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advancement: Some crossing guards will become supervisors, who help hire and 
train other crossing guards. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: "I love the kids and I get to watch them grow up. Now I see kids who 
used to go to school here drive by in cars."

ANN CONWAY: THE RELUCTANT HEROINE; CATHERINE THYEN, WHO SHUNS SPOTLIGHT, IS 
GIVEN DE TOCQUEVILLE AWARD FOR HER GOOD WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't get this picture wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicity is not Catherine Thyen's thing. 
</P>
<P>
 But when you receive United Way of Orange County's first Alexis de Tocqueville 
Heroine Award, you've got to do it -- stand there, let a photographer shoot you 
six ways to Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting used to it," Thyen said before last week's United Way luncheon at 
Big Canyon Country Club in Newport Beach. "But it's uncomfortable, not 
something I seek." 
</P>
<P>
 It is her work on behalf of nonprofit groups such as the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center -- she chairs its popular Candlelight Concert on Dec. 11 
-- South Coast Repertory, the Assessment and Treatment Services Center and Big 
Brothers, Big Sisters of Orange County that got Thyen into United Way's 
spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to honor Catherine because she is very willing to take on 
anything," said United Way activist Marilyn Nielsen, chairwoman of the "Women 
in Leadership" luncheon. "And she remains calm, serene, gracious and totally 
likable when everything is over. Then, she takes on something else." 
</P>
<P>
 On hand to watch Thyen receive her award were members of United Way's Alexis 
de Tocqueville Society, individuals who donate $10,000 or more per year. (De 
Tocqueville was the French author and statesman who wrote extensively about 
America's spirit of volunteerism.) 
</P>
<P>
 How did she feel about being singled out? 
</P>
<P>
 "Appreciative, but embarrassed," said Thyen, who lives in Corona del Mar. 
"It's like being in a classroom when the teacher calls on you to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather be taking a walk around the block. But we (who volunteer) end up 
doing this kind of thing because of a set of circumstances that we've gotten 
ourselves into." 
</P>
<P>
 For Thyen, the circumstances began when she was a girl living in a small rural 
area of Ireland. "I lived where there were a lot of visiting dramatic societies 
who staged plays, so supporting the theater became very important -- especially 
for the girls. That's where I learned to be part of things." 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of her philanthropy is a longing still to be part of a small 
community. "Orange County is a village," Thyen said, laughing. " I'm part of a 
village. If I thought of it any other way, I might be overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think anybody who does a lot of volunteer work probably comes from a small 
community. I just want to do my little bit, not make a name for myself, but be 
part of something." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back on 20 years of volunteerism in Orange County, Thyen -- who has 
served on several boards and assumed a dozen fund-raising chairmanships -- is 
satisfied that the large nonprofit organizations have survived the inflated 
economic boon of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw a tremendous infusion of money here from the '70s through the late 
'80s," she said. "If you look back to the '70s, you'll see that few of the 
large organizations -- ATSC, SCR, the center, Hoag Hospital -- had the big 
buildings they went on to have by the end of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'm glad to say their programs have survived. The reason is, their 
organizations' members never lost sight of what they were supporting. That's 
how you ride out a high and survive a depression." 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, Thyen has noticed "glitter," as she calls it, creeping onto the 
charity scene. "There are little groups of ladies who get together to dress up, 
have lunch. That's fluff, not serious commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "You find the real charity leadership on organization boards like the center. 
By the time you get to be on that board, you're giving a lot of time or money 
or both. 
</P>
<P>
 "The same with the boards of the Newport Harbor Art Museum, United Way, SCR -- 
all of the major organization boards. You don't see window dressing there. 
That's the real leadership." 
</P>

 Shirley MacLaine feted: No sooner had Pacific Symphony supporters giggled than 
they groaned when Shirley MacLaine addressed them following her Segerstrom Hall 
performance on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to compliment you on what you do with your money," said the 
Academy Award-winning actress ("Terms of Endearment") as she stood before the 
crowd at the Tourneau watch store in South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "As Thornton Wilder used to say, money should be spread around like manure, 
encouraging young things to grow." 
</P>
<P>
 After complimenting the arts patrons on the center -- "When I stood on stage 
and realized it was through private contributions that you created this 
magnificent theater, I realized what . . . generous souls you are" -- she 
confessed: "I've never even been to Orange County, much less played here!" 
</P>
<P>
 Then, gazing at the holiday-decorated retail center, she deadpanned: "I am now 
going to shop." 
</P>
<P>
 MacLaine's performance with the orchestra -- which included musical tributes 
to her movies -- "Irma La Douce," "The Apartment," and "Terms of Endearment" 
and a poignant portrayal of "mama Rose" from "Gypsy" -- had guests buzzing 
about the 60-year-old entertainer's theatrical style and staying power. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I watched her performance, I thought she should be doing it on film or 
stage in New York," said the orchestra's executive director, Louis Spisto. "We 
are very lucky to have an entertainer who is also a great actress." 
</P>
<P>
 Also singing MacLaine's praises was actress Nanette Fabray, who was escorted 
by Howard House. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved seeing Shirley tonight," said Fabray. "I've known her since the early 
days of television, when we did a live show together. I knew then she was a 
great talent. I've seen everything she has ever done." 
</P>
<P>
 Other guests were party co-chairmen Nadine and Gene Leyton; Joyce and Ron 
Hanson; conductor Richard Kaufman; Michael Gilano (who conducted one number by 
the orchestra after winning the chance at a symphony ball); Marvin and Pat 
Weiss; and Nancy Sorosky with Jim St. Clair.

JACK SMITH: TRYING TO KEEP SENSE OF BALANCE AND GRACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH, Jack Smith's column is published Mondays. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One thing a columnist ought to have is balance. 
</P>
<P>
 I think I have had pretty good balance over the 30 years or so I have been 
writing this column. 
</P>
<P>
 But I seem to have lost it, politically, if I ever had it. In the recent 
election, I voted on the losing side in all the big races. Of course, I may 
have been right. 
</P>
<P>
 More grievous is the loss of my sense of physical balance. I no longer have 
the automatic balancing skill that most of us acquire before the age of 2. I 
cannot walk safely without a cane or my wife's arm -- and even with those two 
props, my walking is precarious. 
</P>
<P>
 I am prone to falling, and a fall can be disastrous. One can break an arm or a 
leg or even a hip. I have chipped an ankle, bruised both my elbows and a 
shoulder, and, as I have already said, broken my left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with my cane, which I do not use very skillfully, walking is dangerous. I 
was coming out of the bathroom into the hall when I lost my balance and fell. 
My wife was in the hall but did not become aware of my predicament in time to 
save me. I did the usual flinging out of arms and crashed to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 She went to her knees, wailing, and gathered me up in her arms, but the damage 
was done. A broken radius. 
</P>
<P>
 A broken wrist is more disabling than I had imagined. Not only does one lose 
the skills ordinarily performed by the wrist, such as typing and driving a 
wheelchair, but it becomes impossible to fold a newspaper back to an inside 
page. 
</P>
<P>
 More devastating is the loss of balance a free swinging left arm provides. The 
added weight of the fiberglass cast deprives one of this automatic skill. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife rented a wheelchair and hired a woman to help me. But I do not call on 
her as often as I should. After all, I have a sense of adventure and think I 
can make it by myself. The result is too many close calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most ordinary human pastimes become perilous. The other evening my 
wife and I went out for a reception at Chasen's. The room was overcrowded with 
guests, including celebrities such as Kirk Douglas, Charlton Heston, Hal 
Linden, Mariette Hartley, Roddy McDowall and Gordon Davidson, artistic director 
of Center Theatre Group. It was a celebration of the reopening of the remodeled 
Ahmanson Theatre.  
</P>
<P>
 A cocktail party is especially treacherous for a man with no balance. One is 
liable to be knocked over by a guest -- even by a petite woman -- and sent 
sprawling. 
</P>
<P>
 I had asked a waitress to get me a chair and she did, a small wooden one, 
placing it at the edge of the crowd. I was sitting on it drinking a vodka 
tonic, when I lost my balance and began to slide off. My wife had warned me not 
to spill the drink and I remember thrusting my right arm out in an effort to 
save it. 
</P>
<P>
 I was already off the chair and slipping toward the floor when I was grabbed 
by a strong arm that righted me and lifted me to my feet. My savior was none 
other than that heroic figure of the screen -- Kirk Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, I can't always count on such a practiced hero as Douglas to rescue 
me, but I wonder if I couldn't get him to retype these essays for me. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the touch system is hopeless. The result reads like this: Tqui kb 
roddwwn fox jumped over thaae lazy dog;s bsack. 
</P>
<P>
 So I am reduced to the tortuous pick-and-peck system. 
</P>
<P>
 It is heartbreaking to watch athletes or dancers on television. When I see Joe 
Montana roll out of the pocket and throw for a touchdown or watch Ginger Rogers 
and Fred Astaire in one of their dazzling routines, I feel like a clod. 
</P>
<P>
 All my life it has been my ambition to tap-dance. Several years ago, Douglas 
and Burt Lancaster did a little soft shoe together at the Academy Awards. It 
was lovely -- those two big men tapping about so lightly and so gracefully. 
</P>
<P>
 I was so pleased that I wrote a paragraph about their dance and was delighted 
to receive a note of thanks from Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Once I went so far as to enroll in a tap-dancing class in the Valley, but I 
attended only one session. Of course there are many other things I wish I had 
taken time to learn, but I had tap-dancing within my grasp and let it get away. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a moral in this sorry tale, it is that one ought to take the time 
to do what one yearns to do. And don't break a wrist.

 Philatelaughs, courtesy the Postal Service's new stamps: 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Nixon stamp is a bit different from others. After you lick it, it 
leaves a bad taste in your mouth for years." (Michael Connor) 
</P>
<P>
 * "According to the postmaster, you'll be able to accuse the Nixon stamp of a 
cover-up, you just won't be able to make it stick. He also warns that when the 
supply of stamps is gone, you won't have Nixon to lick around anymore." (Bob 
Mills) 
</P>
<P>
 * "You have to lick the new Marilyn Monroe stamp a bunch of times to make it 
stick. But most men don't seem to mind." (Connor) 
</P>
<P>
 * "A Bill Clinton stamp is next to be announced. It's just an Elvis stamp, but 
with gray hair and lipstick on the collar." (Connor)

 In the news: Jay Leno, on a ruling that alleged madam Heidi Fleiss' clients 
will not be revealed: "Maybe someone should tell Judge Ito, 'You can take off 
the fake beard now! You are in the clear.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Comic Argus Hamilton, on the government charging Francisco Duran with trying 
to assassinate the President: "At first, officials thought he was just trying 
to shoot reporters. There's a big difference. One charge is attempted murder; 
the other is hunting without a license." 
</P>
<P>
 In White Marsh, Va., the Sons of Italy plan to boycott Goodfellas Pasta, 
saying the name is a well-known code to link Italian Americans to organized 
crime. Comedy writer Mark Miller says boycott plans "were finalized during a 
meeting at Sleep With the Fishes Cafe." 
</P>
<P>
 A Sellersville, Pa., woman who weighed 1,050 pounds is suing a tabloid for 
comparing her to a baby elephant. Miller says the woman claims "it is one 
insult she will never forget." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Alan Ray, on the President's Hawaiian vacation: "He repeatedly 
keeps hearing the word Aloha! Now if the political pundits would just shut up, 
maybe he could enjoy the islands." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the Newt: Leno, on Clinton's worries, even while he relaxes on the beach 
5,000 miles from Washington: "I guess he put a sea shell to his ear and could 
still hear Newt Gingrich." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Tony Peyser, on reports that House Speaker-to-be Gingrich 
discussed divorce with his ex-wife the day after her cancer surgery, and her 
suing him for failing to make alimony and insurance payments: "He's all for 
family values. Just not necessarily in his family." 
</P>
<P>
 "Interview With the Vampire" continues to do well at theaters. Ray describes 
it as "the story of an ogre who turns his faithful into zombies and who loves 
to go for the throat: Hello, my name is Newt Gingrich ."

<P>
 The senior sound editor said he wanted "elegant, understated love moans." 
</P>
<P>
 Thankfully, it's been years since I'd faked an orgasm, but I knew I could 
still do it and the offer just sounded, uh, interesting. So, after about one 
second of consideration, I said, "I'd love to." 
</P>
<P>
 Being new in L.A., I was eager for something I could tell my hip friends in 
San Francisco that would impress them, or at least convince them that there 
were some cool things to do here. 
</P>
<P>
 I was told that the film, "Don Juan DeMarco," starred Johnny Depp and Marlon 
Brando, and that the scenes I would be moaning for were for a temporary sound 
mix (until they got the actual actress to do it). 
</P>
<P>
 A sound editor showed me clips: Johnny Depp wore a black eye mask (whatever) 
and seduced beautiful women as easily and casually as popping breath mints. 
</P>
<P>
 The sex scenes were very soft core. Just a couple of thigh shots and maybe a 
breast or two. The women were clearly in ecstasy, but without sound, the scenes 
were about as exciting as making ice. 
</P>
<P>
 I felt sorry for the actors as I watched their silent couplings. I eyed their 
full lips futilely opening and closing and was overcome with a profound feeling 
of purpose: I had come to L.A. to give these mute women a voice. 
</P>
<P>
 I anxiously awaited my day of moaning. I practiced the elegant, understated 
breathing the sound editor wanted, but I also rehearsed other variations of the 
love moan, just in case. 
</P>
<P>
 I found the best time to practice was on my daily commute. Instead of 
listening to National Public Radio, I rolled up the window, put on red lipstick 
(for effect) and started from the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 I took a few deep breaths and let them out slowly, sneaking quick glances in 
my rear-view mirror for any nosy cops. After a series of heavy sighs, which I 
thought were very elegant, I began to get bored. I wanted to be understated, 
but the breathing was going nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought of my obligation to the silent women and so, throwing caution to the 
wind, I proceeded to the next stage. Loud, overstated sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 I focused my eyes on the white lines of the freeway and tried to conjure up 
images of Marlon Brando in "A Streetcar Named Desire." I imagined his sweaty, 
sculpted arms bulging out of that thin white T-shirt, and I began to emit a 
low, husky sound from a place somewhere between my abdomen and liver. 
</P>
<P>
 The windows would start to fog about this time, so I rolled them down slowly 
and worked into a series of quick, breathy, I'm-almost-there-don't-stop moans. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time I arrived at work, I was in the middle of a full-fledged screaming 
mock orgasm. After a few days, I felt ready for the automated dialogue 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 The lights were brighter than I had expected and the humongous microphone an 
inch from my mouth made me uneasy. The sound editor picked up on my nervousness 
and offered me a Butterfinger. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweet, familiar taste of the candy bar took me back to my childhood. I 
closed my eyes, thought of all the baseball games I had ever won and launched 
into the most elegant, understated succession of love moans ever to have 
escaped my lips. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few minutes of these high-class moans, I opened my eyes to see the 
sound editor raising his hand up slowly, indicating I should do the same with 
my volume. 
</P>
<P>
 For a moment, I faltered. I was boring him. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought quickly of my baseball mitt, white T-shirts and an old lover named 
Ray, and radiated with passion as I belted out a glorious moan that sounded 
something close to 100 sedated females singing Patsy Cline's "Crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 When I was done, he turned off the recording equipment, picked up the candy 
wrapper and said I was either a great actress or must have had a lot of good 
lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 I smiled, and said I must be a great actress.

FIRST PERSON: COMMITMENTS; THE MAGIC OF CHILDHOOD GROWS HARD IN ADULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CAROLLA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I watched my brother die of an unknown disease I call halfheartedness. Through 
a gradual closing of the heart, many of us seem to join the parade of the 
living dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his death, I have come to understand how magic in a child is wounded 
early by adult cynicism. The poison produced by half-lived lives shows in our 
frowns, frustrations and fears. It acts like a toxin to close the door of a 
child's heart. 
</P>
<P>
 My brother's aging face reflected the closing of his heart. Once full of 
childhood wonder and surprise, it aged to a clown's mask covering dark 
cynicism. It looked like an engraved sneer. That mask became the way he dealt 
with the world, because he could no longer be deeply moved by experiences of 
the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 We accept halfhearted life as a normal way to live. It has become so ingrained 
in our individual and collective psyche that we create institutions, 
professions, literature and religions to support the sleep of the weak-hearted. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you feel your life makes a difference in your family and community? 
</P>
<P>
 Rosa Parks' actions show her wholeheartedness. When told to move to the back 
of the bus, this dignified African American said, "No!" and challenged 
segregation in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahatma Gandhi's life was wholehearted. Nonviolently, he refused to pay an 
unfair salt tax levied by the British government. By that act he started a 
process that allowed India to become a free nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks and Gandhi believed their lives could make a difference -- and they did. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I sat beside my brother, who was slowly suffocating to death following a 
stroke that had damaged the part of his brain that regulates breathing and 
swallowing. 
</P>
<P>
 For four days I watched him struggle for every breath, which most of us assume 
is a natural and ongoing event. Each in-breath was a descent into the hell of 
physical pain; each out-breath was a three-second relief before the descent 
into hell was to begin again. 
</P>
<P>
 As I watched that struggle, I thought about what happens when a process we 
take for granted becomes a battleground for a life-or-death drama. My brother 
battled each breath as if he were in hand-to-hand combat. It took the threat of 
the loss of his last breath to so center his attention that I felt his presence 
for the first time in our 60-year relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, he awoke, looked into my eyes and then lapsed back into the coma. For 
that moment, his armored mask changed into a look of openness I had seen only 
in a childhood photograph of him. In some way, Mario's dying was the most alive 
I had ever experienced him. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought to myself that it seems to take the power of the smell of death to 
descend to the underground river of our deepest nature, where change is 
possible, and our distorted mode of presence is challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 My brother spent his entire life avoiding conflicts and issues that could have 
prepared him for the final crossing. As I watched him gasp for each breath, I 
pondered whether Mario realized how much of his creative energy he had used to 
avoid life. All the energy he used perpetually waiting and constantly hiding 
was summoned for one final breath. That final breath was his attempt to blow 
down the door of death. 
</P>
<P>
 He had lost the connection with the magic kingdom of his original spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 He died the way many of us are dying: pushing love away, filling our lives 
with avoidance addictions and hiding within a fortress made up of the mortar of 
isolation, fear, cynicism. 
</P>
<P>
 I say goodby to Mario and all who lived in quiet despair, never seen, loved, 
nor understood at a deep level. They lived and died in perpetual waiting and 
perpetual loneliness. 
</P>
<P>
 I placed a flower and a note on my brother's grave that said: "I'm sorry for 
you and all the others who die without ever being deeply known. I want to let 
you know that you did not die in vain, if some of us are motivated to search 
for our magic kingdom."

RSVP; BENEFIT AIDS GAY, LESBIAN CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After the wine was poured, Tables 53 and 54 took a moment to toast a friend 
whose memorial service they had all attended that morning.  
</P>
<P>
 "Life in the '90s," real estate developer Loren Ostrow said.  
</P>
<P>
 The gathering that brought them together Saturday night was a fund-raiser for 
the Gay & Lesbian Community Services Center, an event that packed the Century 
Plaza's Los Angeles Ballroom with 1,100 supporters including Jeanie White, 
mother of the late Ryan White; Olympian Greg Louganis; AIDS activist Mary 
Fisher; Southern California ACLU Executive Director Ramona Ripston, and Sheila 
Kuehl, the first openly gay Assemblywoman-elect. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's services are balanced between HIV and AIDS care and gay and 
lesbian services such as counseling, legal aid and a 24-bed youth shelter. "The 
needs for the center grow and grow," said Ostrow, who becomes co-chairman of 
the board in January. "It's more than just an AIDS organization, though that's 
its biggest crisis."  
</P>
<P>
 Producer Aaron Spelling thinks so much of the center that he sneaked out of 
his wedding anniversary party to make an appearance. No one mentioned "Beverly 
Hills 90210" or "Models Inc.," two of his popular-fare series, but rather "And 
the Band Played On," the movie about AIDS, which he also produced.  
</P>
<P>
 Spelling said it's become easier to make television and film projects with 
gay-oriented themes (unlike the four years of network rejections he heard for 
"And the Band Played On"), but "it's not right yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some idiot once asked me if I've ever seen homophobia in Hollywood," Spelling 
added. "You don't have to see a bullfrog to hear it croak."  
</P>
<P>
 Appropriately, Spelling presented the center's Corporate Vision Award to 
Robert Cooper, senior vice president of HBO Pictures. HBO bought "And the Band 
Played On," which garnered an Emmy for the company last year. Cooper said HBO 
is dedicated to presenting the gay and lesbian perspective. Actress-comedian 
Rosie O'Donnell -- who didn't leave her wife's anniversary party to attend, she 
said to the audience's delight -- presented actress Judith Light, who portrayed 
Jeanie White in television's "Ryan White Story," with the Rand Schrader 
Distinguished Achievement Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Schrader, who died of AIDS, was an openly homosexual Los Angeles municipal 
court judge and a founder of the center.  
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I was surprised," Light said of her honor. "I've been very active in 
AIDS-related causes and a natural offshoot seemed to be gay and lesbian rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people are discriminated against, something in the core of me reacts," 
she added. "I don't expect to receive anything for it, it seems right and 
natural to me."

on the studio lot. A party followed in an elegantly embellished tent. This is 
the seventh film in the series, the first with two captains, and possibly the 
last for one of them -- however, he could come back from the beyond at warp 
speed if there's an eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buzz: Industry-types don't know androids from angina, but they do bow in 
unison before a billion-dollar franchise. The consensus: This will play long 
and prosper. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: The film's star, Patrick Stewart; co-stars Brent Spiner, LeVar 
Burton, James Doohan and Michael Dorn; director David Carson; producer Rick 
Berman, plus studio execs Sherry Lansing, Jonathan Dolgen and Kerry McCluggage. 
It was not a star-filled crowd. Because this was a benefit for Brandeis 
University, most of the 800 guests were West Coast alumni. Presumably, what the 
crowd lacked in glitz, it made up for in IQ. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Androids and Androgyny: Stewart on the making of the film: "You've heard 
about the pantyhose, I guess. The whole world seems to have. Bill (Shatner) 
suggested we wear pantyhose underneath our spacesuits so that when we were 
riding the horses, it wouldn't chafe. And he was right. So when you see the 
movie, keep that in mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Pastimes: It was entirely possible to have mind-anesthetizing conversations 
with Trekkers regarding deep-space minutiae. An example: "They can jettison the 
core and save the ship. It's in the technical manual. It is. That's a total 
story line flaw." A few of these and you're ready to initiate the auto-destruct 
sequence. 
</P>
<P>
 Money Matters: Tickets were $150. More than $120,000 was raised for Brandeis 
University's Volen National Center for Complex Systems, which does brain and 
mind study. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: Before the screening, Stewart, who was associated with the Royal 
Shakespeare Company for 25 years before commanding the Enterprise, was pressed 
by a reporter to quote something appropriately Shakespearean for the occasion. 
He thought a moment, then mentioned that scholars have called time the single 
most important word in the Bard's canon and noted that dealing with time's 
passing is one of the film's themes. Then he delivered, "Time hath, my lord, a 
wallet at his back, in which he keeps alms for oblivion." He finished by 
saying, "Tell me what it means."

HOLIDAY TRAVELERS WILL HAVE LOTS OF COMPANY; TRAVEL: JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT BRACES 
FOR RECORD CROWDS BEGINNING WEDNESDAY. FREEWAYS WILL ALSO BE INUNDATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Empowered by bargain air fares and moderate gasoline prices, Thanksgiving 
weekend travelers are expected to clog Southland airports and freeways in 
record numbers this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's John Wayne Airport is braced for overflowing parking lots, 
rental car agencies could run low on their supply of cars and last-minute 
travelers may be shocked to find out how much flights will cost -- if they can 
get them at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called my travel agent and he told me it would cost $1,370 to fly directly 
from Orange County to JFK," said last-minute traveler Shayne Perkins, owner of 
a silk-screen shop in Irvine. "I said, 'Oh, my God! That is ridiculous.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, she said her travel agent was able to have her fly on different 
days and from Los Angeles International, instead of John Wayne, which cut the 
round-trip price to $307. Now Perkins is elated. "For that price, I could take 
a limo to L.A.!" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter where you're going, no matter how you plan to get there, travel 
experts' advice to anyone traveling for the holidays is to be patient and allow 
extra time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a busy year," said Jeffrey Spring, spokesman for the 
Automobile Club of Southern California. Nationally, the auto association is 
predicting 34 million Americans will travel more than 100 miles this 
Thanksgiving holiday, more than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason may be that gasoline is still relatively cheap. A gallon of 
self-service unleaded sold for an average of $1.26 in early November in Orange 
and Los Angeles counties, up eight cents from last year's average of $1.17 but 
down a nickel from $1.31 the year before, according to the Lundberg Survey in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Once they have their full tank, motorists may find a few obstacles on the 
road. Police agencies were planning the usual sobriety checkpoints. And the 
U.S. Border Patrol, which recently reopened its station at San Clemente, is 
routinely checking cars and trucks for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The barriers will be removed so that traffic can become free flowing if the 
lines of vehicles back up more than a mile -- a 15-minute delay -- and agents 
say the two right lanes of the four northbound lanes are usually the fastest 
moving. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers headed for Las Vegas after Thanksgiving Day may encounter heavy 
traffic on Interstate 15. Hotel rooms there are already hard to find, in 
keeping with a three-year trend during the holiday leading up to a 96.3% room 
occupancy rate in 1993. This year, rooms are expected to be just as scarce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanksgiving Day weekend has evolved into a leading holiday weekend for Las 
Vegas," said Terrence Jicinsky, a marketing researcher for the city's 
convention bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike in drought years, the ski slopes should also receive a 
post-Thanksgiving onslaught. "We probably have the best early snow we have had 
in several decades," said Bob Roberts, executive director of the California Ski 
Industry Assn., a trade group in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Mammoth Mountain has two to five feet of snow and some Big Bear 
resorts are open as well. "Certainly we will see heavy bookings for the holiday 
period," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If holiday airline bookings are any indication, the skies may be as crowded as 
the roads this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in business 16 years and this is one of the few years that I can 
remember there are no spaces left" on jetliners, said agent Robert Buckley of 
Gould Travel in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Buckley said the volume of calls at his agency has increased by a third, up to 
about 100 daily calls late last week. "They are calling this minute and want to 
leave for Thanksgiving. I can spend hours just trying to find seats." 
</P>
<P>
 Many travelers booked months in advance to take advantage of a series of air 
fare sales that swept the airline industry in early fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are buying their tickets earlier now and hoping they've got 
the lowest price," said agent Richard Goward at Robinsons May Travel at the 
MainPlace/Santa Ana mall. "But I had a lady who called last week and she 
couldn't go away for Thanksgiving because the prices were double or triple the 
normal rates." 
</P>
<P>
 The worst travel day will likely be Wednesday, a day so busy that Southwest 
Airlines marketing representatives join in loading luggage and checking in 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like people have been traveling earlier in the week, but Wednesday 
is the day we help," said Cheryl Hoban, an Orange County-based marketing 
representative for Southwest. Southwest's 17 outgoing flights from John Wayne 
were booked for that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some air fare bargains cropped up last week as airlines offered deep 
discounts during the travel lull between Wednesday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest offered a $25 one-way fare on any of its flights, including those 
from John Wayne, from 4 p.m. Thanksgiving Day to midnight Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 United Airline's new no-frills Shuttle, which does not serve John Wayne 
Airport, offered a $9.97 promotional fare on 5,600 seats between the Southland 
and the Bay Area for the period from noon Thanksgiving Day to noon Saturday. 
Virtually all of the cheap tickets were snapped up the first day they were 
offered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a new all-time low and the bargain of the century," said Thom Nulty, 
president of Associated Travel Management in Santa Ana. "You can barely get two 
Big Macs and a Coke for $9.97." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if air travelers are lucky enough to have a discount ticket, finding a 
parking place at the airport may be another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking places are increasingly in short supply at John Wayne as the airport 
handles more than 6.2 million passengers a year. In May, the airport turned 440 
long-term spaces into short-term ones, in order to make room for more people 
who are dropping off or picking up passengers. To many, those efforts haven't 
been much help. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friend's plane was late, but instead of being bored I was ticked off," 
said Cindy Bongiovanni of Santa Ana, who had to park in the long-term lot and 
take a shuttle bus to the main terminal when she couldn't find a parking place 
last Thursday. "It's very inconvenient. I've come to this airport about three 
times in 10 years and I've always been able to park in the (main) lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Airport spokeswoman Pat Ware said the crush is coming earlier than normal this 
year. "People must be starting their vacations early this year -- a combination 
of business and leisure," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One solution to the parking shortage might be to use the hourly parking lot in 
front of the main terminal, instead of either of the multistory parking 
structures on either side of the terminal. The hourly lot costs the same $1 an 
hour rate as the other two terminals for short-term parking, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, passengers may want to drive directly to the long-term parking lot off 
Main Street, which usually has spaces available, Ware said. Extra buses will be 
shuttling passengers to the terminal on Wednesday and Sunday, the two busiest 
travel days. 
</P>
<P>
 Some arriving passengers may have their own special set of problems, such as 
finding a rental car. Rental car agencies say they are expecting a heavy demand 
in all sizes and types of vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing double-digit percentage increases in Hertz's booking activities 
compared to last year," said Hertz Rent A Car spokesman Joe Russo in Park 
Ridge, N.J. "The Thanksgiving travel week is one of the busiest of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Asplin, manager of the Dollar Rent A Car agency at John Wayne, said 
travelers should make sure they have reservations. "Most of the rental car 
(agencies) have tightened down their fleets," he said. "We have been running 
out."

HOLIDAY SEASON CATCHES A RISING STARSHIP; 7TH 'STAR TREK' BLASTS OFF WITH $23.2 
MILLION AT MOVIE BOX OFFICE AS OVERALL SALES ARE UP 50% FROM YEAR AGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Star Trek: Generations" was rocketing ahead of the still-simmering "Interview 
With the Vampire" and "The Santa Clause" Sunday to lead a powerful box-office 
launch for the 1994 holiday movie season -- up 50% or more from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall tickets sales on the weekend that many consider the official start of 
the holiday movie season were estimated at close to $95 million, with the 
Thanksgiving weekend -- traditionally one of the year's best movie-going 
weekends -- coming right up. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 1 film -- by several light years -- was "Star Trek: Generations." The 
seventh feature film in the intergalactic saga, and the first based on "The 
Next Generation" series spin-off, brought in die-hard fans as well as a new 
generation of Trekkers, soaring to an estimated $23.2 million on 2,659 screens 
in its first three days. It's the best launch of any of the "Star Trek" films. 
Add another $3 million from Thursday night special previews on 1,300 screens, 
and Paramount Pictures is probably already drafting the script for the eighth 
episode. 
</P>
<P>
 The Starship Enterprise blasted "Interview With the Vampire." After the 
fifth-largest debut weekend ever of $36.3 million, Tom Cruise and his merry 
band of bloodsuckers was drained of more than half its business, down to a 
projected $18.1 million, following the conventional pattern for horror movies. 
</P>
<P>
 But shed no tears for Lestat and Louis, since "Interview" has already sucked 
up $64 million in its first 10 days -- although both first and second weekend 
grosses are the subject of some dispute in the industry. Still, "Vampire" 
should get an infusion over the Thanksgiving holiday. How it holds up over the 
long term, however, will be closely watched based on this weekend's drop. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend had begun resembling Noah's Ark. There seemed to be two of every 
kind of film. But the results were more akin to Darwin's theory of natural 
selection. Of the two Kris Kringle flicks, "The Santa Clause" and the debuting 
"Miracle on 34th Street," the former is clearly the Uber-mensch.  
</P>
<P>
 After last weekend's $19.3-million opening for "Santa Clause," Tim Allen's 
agents were already upping his asking price several million. And based on the 
$16.3 million done in the second weekend -- more than $40 million in 10 days -- 
the $100-million level for the film appears likely. That would end a long dry 
spell for Disney's (non-animated) feature film division. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Miracle" would need one to save it from quick extinction. Despite a 
barrage of sneak previews the previous weekend, the John Hughes production 
opened to a grinch-like $2.7 million on 1,190 screens. After last summer's 
debacle of "Baby's Day Out," many are wondering what happened to the Hughes of 
"Home Alone." 
</P>
<P>
 In the animation wars, the reissue of "The Lion King" ate "The Swan Princess" 
for breakfast. After being withdrawn from theaters last summer, Disney's "King" 
returned to his perch with $5.5 million over the weekend, taking in over $275 
million. Now "The Lion King" will play tortoise and hare with "Forrest Gump" as 
both chug toward the phenomenal $300-million mark. 
</P>
<P>
 "Swan" got a frog caught in its throat with a wan $2.5-million opening, yet 
another casualty of Disney's apparent lock on animation. (On Wednesday, "The 
Pagemaster," featuring Macaulay Culkin combined with animation, will also enter 
dubious battle against "The Lion King.") 
</P>
<P>
 The duel of gun-toters, "Pulp Fiction" and the debuting "The Professional," 
was won by the latter from French director Luc Besson ("La Femme Nikita"). "The 
Professional" got off to an adequate start with $5.1 million on 1,158 screens, 
pumping some new lead into the action market. The long-running "Pulp," however, 
only dropped to $3 million, proving there's life in it yet. To date "Pulp" has 
grossed more than $48 million. Keenan Ivory Wayans' gumshoe flick "Low Down 
Dirty Shame" joins them, starting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The other sci-fi movie, "Stargate," took a hit from "Star Trek" but still 
managed a flight-worthy $4.4 million and has now grossed $52 million. But the 
other florid horror movie, "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein," dropped out of the 
Top 10, taking in only $1.6 million, squeaking past the $20-million level after 
three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on Sunday's business, "The War" will do somewhere between $2.8 
million to $3 million over the weekend -- aided only a bit by the sneak 
previews of Arnold Schwarzenegger's pregnancy comedy "Junior" on Friday and 
Saturday night. "The War" has basically lost the battle with only about $13 
million in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the weekend box-office tally was far ahead of the comparable weekend 
last year, which had an approximate gross of $56.8 million. In 1992, the ticket 
take was $74.2 million -- led by "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," which alone 
snagged $31.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In another notable debut this weekend, Zhang Yimou's banned-in-China "To Live" 
arrived in two theaters in New York, garnering a strong $33,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Final weekend estimates will be released today.

ISLE-HOPPING TO AMERICA'S MAINSTREAM; THEATER: EDUARDO MACHADO'S 'FLOATING 
ISLANDS' IS A SYMBOL FOR L.A.'S CUBAN AMERICANS WHO SEE THEIR OWN STORIES 
REFLECTED IN THE DRAMA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mark Taper Forum may be a long way from Miami's Little Havana, but lately 
it has become a gathering spot for Los Angeles' Cuban Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The draw is Eduardo Machado's epic drama, "Floating Islands," the story of one 
clan's journey from Cuba to the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Presented in two parts, the production comprises four plays, beginning with 
"The Modern Ladies of Guanabacoa," which is set in a middle-class Cuban home in 
1928. "In the Eye of the Hurricane" and "Fabiola" take place in the pivotal 
years of 1960 and 1961. And the final play, "Broken Eggs," unfolds in 1980 
Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Filled with stormy domestic imbroglios and set against the backdrop of a 
country turned on its ear by revolution, the saga tells of one bourgeoise 
family's struggle, relocation and eventual assimilation into a new culture. It 
follows three generations of characters and takes more than six hours to 
perform. 
</P>
<P>
 It's based loosely on the playwright's own family history. Yet partly because 
so few plays about the Cuban experience have made it to mainstream stages, 
"Floating Islands" has become a symbolic moment of visibility for many Cuban 
American theatergoers who see their own story reflected in the drama. 
</P>
<P>
 One play can't, of course, be all things to all Cubans. Consequently, some 
feel it represents their experience well, while others are disappointed. But 
nearly all are pleased to see the presence of Cuban characters onstage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a beautiful nostalgic trip," says George Hernandez, director of 
post-production at Paramount Pictures, who left Cuba at age 7 and lived in 
Miami until he was 19. "It was a satisfying tapestry of memories, reflective of 
a middle-class Cuban experience and also of my memories of my grandparents." 
</P>
<P>
 "Floating Islands" also reflects the Angst.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was moved by the play," says Al Nodal, general manager of L.A.'s Cultural 
Affairs department, who went to Miami from his native Cuba in 1957 and lived in 
Florida until 1972. "It captured the Cuban ethos -- the psychological torture 
that we all go through dealing with the loss of our homeland -- in an elegant 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The experience that we all share is displacement, and Eduardo did a good job 
of playing out the reasons for that," Nodal continues. "It captured feelings 
that we all have without getting overly political." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the response to Machado's drama has been more cultural than political 
-- probably because L.A. County's Cuban American population, numbering 
approximately 50,000, tends to be less overtly partisan than its Florida 
counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's more diversity of points of view here," Nodal says. "There's 
everything from people who support dialogue to die-hards for the embargo. There 
are some who support the revolution at this point, but a small amount." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet those differences don't seem to matter when it comes to "Floating 
Islands." And that is largely a matter of tolerance, especially when it comes 
to Machado's comparatively liberal agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cubans in L.A. have a more open attitude," Hernandez says. "We don't look at 
it only as Castro/anti-Castro. There's more to life than hating Fidel Castro." 
</P>
<P>
 Then too, the left-leaning tendencies of the entertainment industry skew the 
curve. "There's definitely a Latin network (in the entertainment industry), and 
a lot of them are Cubans," says Carola Ash, director of development for actor 
and fellow countryman Andy Garcia's production company. "But because people are 
here for film, you tend to talk more about that than politics." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have little firsthand knowledge of revolutionary Cuba do praise 
Machado for raising the general consciousness of that time and place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoyed it very much, particularly the first two stories," says Ash, who 
left Cuba in 1964 at age 6, grew up in England, and has lived in L.A. for the 
past 2 1/2 years. "My family was not a typical case, because my father was a 
writer, so it wasn't like he had a business that was taken away. But I know a 
lot of hard-working people whose property was taken from them." 
</P>
<P>
 The one aspect of "Floating Islands" that consistently draws criticism, 
however, is the drama's prominent representation of homosexual incest. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some rough things . . . but that is part of the plot," says Teresa 
Munoz Shaffer, who left her native Cuba in 1962, moved to L.A. in 1975 and 
works as an arts journalist for the Florida magazine Replica and the L.A.-based 
newspaper El Noticiero. "It had nothing to do with the revolution. It has some 
political things in it, but it's definitely not a political play." 
</P>
<P>
 Others feel that Machado's work fails to evoke the richness of Cuban culture. 
"It was lacking in a cultural basis," says Armando Castro, manager of 
Hollywood's El Floridita restaurant, a Cuban community hangout since it opened 
in 1987. "The music, literature and art is not in there. For being too long and 
sometimes boring, I would say it was incomplete." 
</P>
<P>
 In that way, he says, "Floating Islands" fails to counter the ills of 
assimilation. "Cubans here lose their culture (when) they come into the 
American stream," says Castro, who emigrated from Cuba to Florida in the 
mid-1950s. "The kids become Americans and go eat hamburgers. Eventually they 
don't even know what Cuban food is." 
</P>
<P>
 The absence in L.A. of a specifically Cuban neighborhood like Miami's Little 
Havana also contributes to the disjuncture. "Cubans in L.A. are all over the 
place geographically," says Hernandez. "We don't live in the same 
neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the same factors that mitigate against a unified identity also make 
L.A. Cubans hungry for their native culture. "You're never going to find a more 
Cuban group of Cuban Americans than the ones in L.A.," says Hernandez. "Because 
we are so far away from Miami and Cuba, we are almost like double exiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are more appreciative of the cultural things because we don't have them 
easily accessible," Hernandez continues. "In Miami, it's in every corner. Here, 
we have to look for it." 
</P>

HOWARD ROSENBERG: TV NEEDS ITS OWN CONTRACT WITH AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Television is out of touch with the nation and is in big trouble. But the 
solution is not necessarily to throw out the bums in charge. Rather, partisan 
politics aside, the television industry should follow the lead of Republicans 
and draft a "contract with America." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some sample proposals: Balanced Budgets of Newscasts 
</P>
<P>
 Newscast budgets (the daily schedules of stories) are usually so unbalanced, 
if not flat-out slanted and deficient, that they present a distorted view of 
society, both globally and domestically. This is especially true when it comes 
to coverage of most minorities, their appearance in stories being largely 
limited to news connected to violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The cumulative impact of this coverage is significant, teaching that mayhem 
and minorities (code, in this instance, for Latinos and African Americans) are 
synonymous. Hence, these minorities are to be feared and despised by the rest 
of us, and made scapegoats for the broader society's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Overwhelming approval of Proposition 187, the California initiative whose 
provisions to abort most social services to illegal immigrants is now in legal 
limbo, may testify to the scapegoat factor. 
</P>
<P>
 As evidence of how the cumulative fear factor works on white suburbanites, I 
offer the following personal anecdote concerning a recent visit to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 While walking alone at midday in an upper middle-class neighborhood, I noticed 
a man approaching me on the sidewalk from the opposite direction. 
Average-looking guy. Average dress. Still, I felt an instinctive dart of fright 
(for all I know, he did, too), which vanished only after we had passed each 
other without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the flash of panic? Only one reason, not a rational one: The man was 
African American. Anti-Crime Measures 
</P>
<P>
 Curtailment of crime news must accompany the balancing of news budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true that street crime is easier and cheaper to cover than more important 
stories that require greater skills and sophistication on the part of reporters 
and greater sustained commitment from their bosses, who set priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there's still no excuse for local stations continuing to lead newscasts 
with up to a half-dozen stories on violent street crimes, giving them weight 
far beyond their true significance in the broader context, and creating the 
false impression that everyone everywhere is constantly in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder that, despite figures showing a decline in violent crime in many 
locales, many Americans continue to regard it as society's greatest peril, and 
that candidates who shout the loudest about being "tough" on crime stand the 
best chance of being elected. Voluntary Prayer in Prime Time 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to be Newt Gingrich, a soldier in the religious right or even 
moderately devout to dislike mainstream television's traditional dismissal of 
theology as something either to ridicule or ignore. Only rarely do prime-time 
series, for example, depict religious figures as deserving respect -- when 
they're allowed to surface at all, that is. In fact, you see more hookers, 
rapists and serial murderers on TV than clerics. 
</P>
<P>
 With religion so prominent in the lives of many Americans, you'd think that 
the major networks would find room on their schedules for an occasional drama 
series revolving around some churchly edifice, one that neither celebrates nor 
denigrates religion, but examines its strengths and weaknesses through the 
lives of ordinary characters. 
</P>
<P>
 If religion is boring, why is it important to so many people? Promo Reform 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing is more irritating than prime-time news inserts designed to tease and 
entice viewers with incomplete information ("Death Takes Hollywood Giant. News 
at 11"). They must end. 
</P>
<P>
 Even worse, though, are promos that withhold critical, possibly life-saving 
information purely for self-serving reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, is the prime-time magazine series "Dateline NBC" in the news 
business or the suspense business? The answer comes in the current issue of TV 
Guide, where a large ad for Tuesday's program carries a photo of a house in 
flames beneath this shrieking headline: 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a Family Killer in Your House." 
</P>
<P>
 The ad copy describes "an ordinary household product that's caused countless 
fires and deaths. The burning question . . . why haven't you been warned?" 
</P>
<P>
 A bigger question: Why isn't "Dateline NBC" warning you now? 
</P>
<P>
 A listing for the program on the next page expands on the ad: "Lea Thompson 
reports the dangers of a household product that can start fires due to 
spontaneous combustion. Included are comments from a Seattle fire investigator 
and some Connecticut families." 
</P>
<P>
 Not included in the ad or TV listing is the name of this supposedly lethal 
household product. That's right, nearly five dozen words used as a come-on to 
hook viewers, but not one identifying this "family killer" that you may have in 
your house even as you read this. 
</P>
<P>
 If the product is that perilous, "Dateline NBC" should announce its name 
immediately in the cause of saving lives, right? Instead, it has enlisted 
Product X in the cause of boosting the program's audience totals during this 
month's crucial ratings sweeps that help determine TV advertising rates. The 
strategy: By omitting possibly critical information, motivate viewers to tune 
in Tuesday for the big disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless they're incinerated in the meantime. Term Limits 
</P>
<P>
 Really now, hasn't Rush Limbaugh been around long enough?

THE NUART PLANS 20TH ANNIVERSARY BASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN MONIQUE FAUSTINA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Lynch and Ridley Scott are among the filmmakers scheduled to appear at 
the 20th anniversary celebration of the Nuart Theatre in West Los Angeles for a 
nine-day retrospective, beginning Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuart has launched the careers of Lynch ("Eraserhead") and many other 
enterprising filmmakers including John Waters ("Pink Flamingos"), John Woo 
("The Killer"), Jane Campion ("Sweetie") and Gus Van Sant ("Drugstore Cowboy") 
during its two decades of operation by Landmark Theatre Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-'70s, the Nuart was predominantly a repertory house, screening two 
different films a night, every night of the week. The theater adapted to the 
advent of video by playing more premieres while still presenting the occasional 
festival and retrospective. Filmgoers have been able to experience restorations 
of movie classics including "Citizen Kane," "King Kong," "A Streetcar Named 
Desire," "Gone With the Wind" and the director's cut of "Blade Runner," as well 
as first-run films. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are thrilled that we can provide a showcase for up-and-coming filmmakers," 
said Landmark co-founder Gary Meyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The late Burt Lancaster visited the theater one opening night and spoke to the 
audience for more than 45 minutes. "(Lancaster) was so true to his passion," 
Meyer recalled. "It was one of those totally magical nights and that's what the 
Nuart is all about." A special tribute to Lancaster is included in the 
retrospective. 
</P>
<P>
 The schedule includes "Visions of Light: The Art of Cinematography" and 
"Citizen Kane" (Wednesday); "The Killer" and "Onimasa" (Thursday); "L.A. 
Connection Live," performing and improvising on "Plan Nine From Outer Space" 
(Friday); "Blade Runner" (director's cut) and "Akira" (Saturday); A Tribute to 
Burt Lancaster: "The Crimson Pirate" and "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral," "Sweet 
Smell of Success" and "Birdman of Alcatraz" (Sunday); "Pink Flamingos" and 
"Eraserhead" (Nov. 28); "Salaam Bombay" and "Sweetie" (Nov. 29); "Wings of 
Desire" and "Stalker" (Nov. 30); "Drugstore Cowboy" and "Slacker" (Dec. 1).  
</P>
<P>
 Tickets are $7.50 for each double bill, except for "L.A. Connection Live," 
which is $10. Information: (310) 478-6379.

A PRIME CUT; A MAN'S PLACE IS IN THE CHAIR AT PETE'S BARBER SHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only a thin membrane of wood and glass separates Pete's Barber Shop from the 
anxious current of time outside its windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, as in a backwater just out of reach of the torrent, is a tiny pool of 
calm where men and boys can secure a moment of clarity, however briefly, and 
fix on distant dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever the eye roams in the cramped Thousand Oaks barbershop -- front wall, 
back wall, the sides -- it takes in the glossy skin of thousands of spent 
lottery tickets handed over by scores of customers. 
</P>
<P>
 All losers, the tickets are tacked or stapled to the walls in neat, 
categorized rows, as if to bring a trace of order to a runaway world and salute 
dashed hope as much as endless effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Scattered among them are posters of beautiful women who are as far from the 
men's reach as lottery jackpots -- and provide as much grist for oratory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the last bastion of masculinity," Larry Golding said as he rose from the 
barber's chair, the skin around his ears a raw pink from a fresh hairline 
shave. 
</P>
<P>
 A fixture at 2811 E. Thousand Oaks Blvd. for three decades, Pete's has long 
served as a fleeting refuge where customers can drift back to a time when life 
was simple and hair was cut, not styled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't do any of that," snorted barber Louie Nocera, 57, whose rough humor 
acts as a sort of gatekeeper for new customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Endure this rite of passage, this harmless fusillade of quips and cuts, and 
you are what Nocera proudly calls "a customer for life." 
</P>
<P>
 Fail it, and you can go somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hole in the wall, but we do OK," said owner Pete Torres, 59, a 
soft-spoken man of many words and even more loyal customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether retiree or high-school football player, stone-cutter or surgeon, each 
customer is offered the same options -- you want talk, fine; you want silence, 
fine. No one gets special treatment, not even such celebrities as Sam Elliot, 
Bob Denver or Mickey Rooney. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not going to look pretty, so don't laugh," Nocera said as he handed a 
mirror to Irmo Tiritilli, 83, of Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the barber's teasing in stride, Tiritilli said: "Very nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Then his eyes lit up with mischief when Nocera said he hoped he, too, could 
reach 83. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, but I can't do a lot of what I used to, you know," Tiritilli said, and 
he winked. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres, a genial man with snow-white hair who can trade barbs with the best of 
them, said, "It's an old shop, but that's usually what people come looking for. 
. . . I don't want to speak for the other old-fashioned barbers, but I have a 
feeling we're the 'Last of the Mohicans.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Free of pomp and frill, an afterthought that even a bicyclist might miss with 
the blink of an eye, the driftwood-gray storefront has largely escaped the 
notice of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 It is small, not much larger than a walk-in closet of the privileged, and its 
world is just as insular, defined by dogeared Playboy magazines, football 
pennants for the Bears and Broncos, and the requisite game trophy, a 
fat-bellied German brown trout suspended in mute struggle over customers' 
heads. 
</P>
<P>
 "One guy comes in, waving his hands like this," Nocera said with disgust, "and 
he says, 'You fluff, you layer, you fluff, you layer.' And I said you . . . go 
(to a salon) to get your hair styled for $36." 
</P>
<P>
 Properly corrected, the man said, " 'No, no, you do what you want then,' and 
he's been a customer every since,' " Nocera recounted. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuts are cheap, $8 a head, no credit cards are accepted and no one dares ask 
for such namby-pamby delicacies as manicures or appointments. This is a joint 
where nose hairs are trimmed, no questions asked, or ear hairs -- "or whatever 
else they want," Nocera said. 
</P>
<P>
 When business surges -- which can be at any time -- patrons shuffle and jostle 
for space. 
</P>
<P>
 Which they did on a recent afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 A Marine with muscular, tattooed arms, a forklift operator, a sixth-grader -- 
the customers filed in, got their hair cut with time to spare and returned to 
the afternoon, their heads and necks suddenly exposed to the chill air. The ebb 
and flow of men and boys was much like the conversation, steady and unhurried, 
spiced with innuendo. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do we talk about?" Nocera repeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Golding said, "We talk politics, sports, sex." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mostly sex," said part-time barber Leo Kleinert, 56, who was filling in for 
Torres. 
</P>
<P>
 Nocera chuckled. "And jokes." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mostly dirty jokes," Golding said. 
</P>
<P>
 All three barbers' chairs were full. So were the six waiting chairs. Tufts of 
hair littered the black-and-white checkered floor. There was no steady chatter 
under the milky fluorescent lights, only terse sentences, a little laughter 
here, a little silence there. The wind freshened outside. Colors gained that 
crisp hue, that sense of promise -- or maybe even warning -- that comes with 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going to be cold tonight," observed Steve Henkens, glancing outside as the 
conversation gusted and died like the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 Nocera said, " 'Sposed to rain, I hear." 
</P>
<P>
 "At about 9, they said," said barber Tony Frageorgia, 52. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look bald," 8-year-old Colby Henkens said. He was looking into the mirror 
while Nocera was shaving his head, giving him a "buzz" haircut. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Steve, said: "Remember the picture you saw of Yul Brenner?" 
</P>
<P>
 "He was totally bald." 
</P>
<P>
 "At least you have hair," the father said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
 The father smiled. "Maybe you won't some day." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at the shrine to broken dreams on the walls -- or maybe simply the 
hubris of the dreamers -- Colby Henkens asked Nocera if he had bought any of 
the lottery tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesting, the barber said, "That's Pete's doing. Do I look that stupid?" 
</P>
<P>
 The boy mumbled something inaudible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't talk like that," Nocera said in feigned rebuke. "That way, I won't give 
you a lollipop." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he did just that. "Now get out of here." 
</P>
<P>
 For all his bluff and bluster, Nocera is an unwavering reflection of Torres, 
whose gentle presence lingers even in his absence. People always ask about him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's Pete?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Is Pete staying out of trouble?" 
</P>
<P>
 Always skilled with his hands, Torres helped mend downed fighter pilots while 
serving as a Navy corpsman on the aircraft carrier USS Princeton during the 
Korean War. He remembers standing on the giant ship's decks in the depth of 
night, nearly drawn backward by the vault of stars that reached out toward 
infinity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was beautiful, my friend," he said, revealing the sense of awe and kinship 
that has bound him to so many people. 
</P>
<P>
 That he would end up giving haircuts named after carriers like the Princeton 
-- flattops -- never occurred to him at the time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "There's not a lot of hairstylists or hairdressers out there that 
can cut a nice flattop." 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, Torres returned to his native Colorado and then emigrated with 
his young bride to work at an aerospace firm in Santa Monica. There, he 
conducted stress tests for plastics on the Saturn rockets, which were used to 
launch the Apollo missions to the moon in the 1960s. After work, he would cut 
hair at a barbershop across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had three young children those days," Torres offered in explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1964, he and his wife bought their dream house in Newbury Park and Torres 
went to work at Casey's Barber Shop, which had occupied the former post office 
space since the early 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1965, Torres bought the business and renamed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Of his customers, he said: "They're all nice people. I love them all."

STREET SMART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: Recently we tried to report what appeared to be a drunk 
driver in a pickup truck, but were unable to get two digits of the license 
plate because it was partially blocked by a pipe rack. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, we have observed hundreds of vehicles with damaged or dirty plates 
and others blocked by hitches or steps. Also, hundreds of vehicles have no 
front plates. 
</P>
<P>
 What laws and penalties apply to these infractions? 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Wing, Reseda 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: In California, the law requires license plates to be completely 
visible. That means every letter and number must be readable, said Officer John 
Baby of the Los Angeles Police Department's Valley Traffic Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers whose plates are even partially blocked can face a so-called "fix-it" 
ticket -- meaning they need to correct the problem, but don't end up with a 
black mark on their driving record. 
</P>
<P>
 And, Baby added, plates must be affixed to both the front and back of a car. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: My question deals with how to fight an out-of-state parking 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother is a resident of Illinois and received a parking ticket in Woodland 
Hills in March. When she went to pay the ticket, she told the clerk that she 
wanted to fight it. 
</P>
<P>
 But since she was returning to Illinois in three weeks, the clerk told her to 
pay the ticket and write to the court to explain the ticket. If she won, the 
clerk told her, the $30 would be refunded. 
</P>
<P>
 She lost, but a letter said she had the right to appeal, which she did. This 
time, she enclosed evidence and a photo of her car's handicapped license plate. 
</P>
<P>
 To this date, she has not received a reply. 
</P>
<P>
 I tried to call courts in Van Nuys and Los Angeles as well as the parking 
enforcement office. Nobody knew anything about the case. I was told that the 
appeal process requires a fee of $25 and that a driver must appear in person or 
the case is closed. 
</P>
<P>
 My stepfather is on dialysis and after his sessions he is too weak to walk to 
the apartment without help. My mother was helping him. That's why the car was 
parked illegally for a minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Rohde, Van Nuys 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: Unfortunately, there is little left to do except chalk the 
incident up as experience. We took your case to Los Angeles parking enforcement 
officials who said it was highly unlikely that you would win an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason? Handicapped plates do not allow drivers to park where and when 
they please. The plates permit drivers to park in handicapped spaces, but 
drivers must still observe other laws -- such as not parking in red zones -- 
and abide by all restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a limitation on handicapped privileges that a lot of drivers do not 
understand," the parking official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since you did not send in the $25 to file an appeal, your case file is 
probably floating unattended somewhere in the bureaucratic fog of the Los 
Angeles Municipal Court system.

HOSPITAL STAFF BAFFLED BY 13-YEAR CEO'S ABRUPT EXIT; HEALTH CARE: SOME BLAME 
DEPARTURE OF ROBERT QUIST AT LOS ROBLES REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER ON CHANGING 
CORPORATE NATURE OF MEDICINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks, doctors and staff 
members are still baffled by the unexpected departure of chief administrator 
Robert Quist from the hospital's top office. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors who worked with him describe Quist fondly as a "quality guy," a strong 
leader who had been instrumental to the success of east Ventura County's 
largest hospital and a consummate professional during 13 years as its top 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, then, did he suddenly lose his job 10 days ago? 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the Ventura County medical community assign the blame to the 
ever-changing face of health care. 
</P>
<P>
 They say that as a representative of the "old guard," Quist was a victim of 
the national movement away from the comfortable, traditional doctor-patient 
health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 The removal of Quist is just another example of a system that replaces kindly 
old Marcus Welbys with those identified by the decidedly unfriendly title of 
"gatekeeper," they say. 
</P>
<P>
 But, more specifically, they blame the big corporate boss, Columbia / HCA 
Healthcare Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 From the maternity ward to the cafeteria and scrub rooms, there is anxiety and 
anger at Los Robles. If Quist, practically an institution at the 216-bed 
hospital since 1982, can be fired, staffers wonder how many others might be 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Columbia / HCA sought to squelch talk that there might be layoffs 
at the hospital and to smooth over what company officials acknowledge has been 
an awkward transition period. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take full responsibility for that," said Steve Monaghan, chief operating 
officer of Columbia / HCA's Pacific regional division, which oversees the 
company's holdings in California. "There was a communication problem. We're 
certainly going to try and do everything we can to improve communications 
between the regional division and the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia / HCA is an international corporation based in Louisville, Ky. It 
owns 195 hospitals in the United States, England and Switzerland. The company 
was formed in March when Louisville-based Columbia Healthcare Corp. merged with 
Nashville, Tenn.-based HCA-Hospital Corp. of America, which formerly owned Los 
Robles. Locally, Columbia / HCA now owns Los Robles and a hospital in West 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Columbia / HCA, Quist resigned Nov. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Quist did not respond to requests for an interview. But friends say he has 
told them that he was fired. And around the Ventura County medical community, 
no one seems to believe the corporate word on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a rude awakening for us about big business," said Larry McAdam, a 
doctor of internal medicine at Los Robles who has been a friend of Quist's for 
years. "I don't really know what is behind this decision. It baffles me. 
</P>
<P>
 "This does not bode well for our local hospital," he said. "I think the method 
in which it was handled was unprofessional, precipitous and unwarranted." 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, McAdam said, Columbia / HCA could have consulted the 
medical staff at Los Robles. "It caught everyone by surprise. HCA would never 
have removed him. This tells me that Columbia has a different philosophy, which 
really disturbs me." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of his colleagues said they believed that Quist, 49, was treated badly by 
CHCA. They said they worry about him, pointing out that he has children in 
college and that last year he took out a mortgage on an expensive new home in 
Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Neurologist Paul Dudley said many of Quist's colleagues are writing and faxing 
letters to Columbia / HCA protesting his departure. Monaghan said he had 
received a few letters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority consensus is that it was a big loss to the hospital," Dudley 
said. "We are all shocked and somewhat concerned. If the new ownership doesn't 
see him as a quality guy, we are not sure what their idea of a quality guy is." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the local medical community see the timing of Quist's departure as 
particularly unfortunate. The week of his resignation, Los Robles was in the 
middle of a review by a joint commission that includes representatives from the 
state Department of Health Services and California Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 On the basis of its review, the joint commission decides whether a hospital 
will receive full or partial accreditation, a critical part of maintaining a 
good reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the accreditation, hospitals face losing federal reimbursements from 
Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as increases in insurance rates and an 
unwillingness by some insurance companies to send patients there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Accreditation shows the community that the hospital is running a good 
operation and that it runs efficiently and effectively," said Monty Clark, a 
regional vice president for the Hospital Council of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The three- to four-day process is extensive and expensive, costing even the 
smallest hospital several thousand dollars, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a once-over lightly," Clark said. "It's very intense. When you know 
you're going to have a joint commission survey, you need the glue to hold the 
team together. The chief executive officer is the glue that holds the team 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Quist left the hospital the day after the joint commission completed its 
survey. He has told friends that Columbia / HCA wanted him to leave earlier, 
but that he wanted to be there for the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Monaghan declined to discuss the details of Quist's departure, he 
said Quist decided when he would leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did hope to work out a transition period with Mr. Quist," Monaghan said. 
"The timing of the departure was his choice. He was offered an alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 Monaghan would not elaborate on what the alternative was. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Robles spokeswoman Jill Donahue said initial reports from the survey team 
indicate that the hospital will receive full accreditation, and possibly even a 
commendation. She said Quist told staff that he was leaving the hospital at the 
same time he delivered the good news about the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like, you want the good news or the bad news first," Donahue said. "He 
is such a gentlemen. Of course, he was very proud. His words were that this was 
the best going-away present that we could have given him. He was a class act 
right down to the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside Los Robles, members of the local medical community said they were also 
dismayed to learn that Quist was leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was saddened and surprised," said Mike Bakst, executive director of 
Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura. "Bob is one of the main staples of the 
health care community in Ventura County. He is well-respected and liked. He is 
viewed as a progressive and dynamic administrator. That hospital was like a 
home to him." 
</P>
<P>
 But at Los Robles, not everyone shares that opinion. While many of the doctors 
there say Quist was an effective leader, there are those who say he may have 
taken too long to adapt to changes in health care. He may have been regarded as 
somewhat provincial and resistant to managed care, critics suggest, and it may 
have cost him his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others speculate that Quist was fired to make room for Ken Underwood, 
who came from regional headquarters to take over the position of chief 
operating officer at Los Robles last week, stepping into a job that had been 
vacant for six months. Underwood will temporarily assume Quist's duties as 
well, and some staffers say they think that Monaghan was simply trying to bring 
in one of his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is totally untrue," Monaghan said. "Before we moved out here four months 
ago, we had conversations with Mr. Quist about Ken coming. He was in full 
support of Ken Underwood taking that position. It is simply the No. 2 spot and 
had nothing to do with Mr. Quist's departure." 
</P>
<P>
 Underwood was probably moved into the position more quickly than anticipated 
because of the void left by Quist, Monaghan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As for the part about him being a friend, I have known him for a long time," 
Monaghan said. "He has a superb knowledge of health care issues. And he is a 
friend, yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Some staffers say that Quist was let go as part of a cost-cutting plan and 
that Columbia / HCA hopes to have administrators at West Hills split their time 
between the two hospitals instead of replacing him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely incorrect," Monaghan said. "As we speak, I'm engaged in a CEO 
search for Los Robles. I already have six outstanding candidates. The two 
hospitals are totally different markets." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he hopes to have narrowed the field within a few weeks. And whoever 
the finalists are, he says he will ask physicians at the hospital to evaluate 
them, soothing the ruffled feathers of those who believed that they should have 
been consulted about Quist's sudden departure. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Monaghan: "I hope to have a couple for the physicians to speak with, so 
they can meet them and feel comfortable with them."

CLASS AWARENESS; VENTURA STUDENTS RAISE FUNDS TO HELP PRESERVE RAIN FOREST IN 
BELIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After raising enough money last year to save one acre of the Brazilian rain 
forest, seventh-graders at Ventura's Anacapa Middle School made a simple 
request of their teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'Why don't you go down and see what they're doing with our money?' 
" teacher Marcia Greycloud recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 So she did. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to the Amazon, but to the Costa Rican jungle on a trip sponsored by a 
nonprofit environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
 And after touching, smelling and seeing for herself the exotic animals and 
lush flora of the region, Greycloud returned to her classroom this school year 
with a renewed passion and determination to help slow the rain forest's 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Now she is trying to ignite the same desire in her students. 
</P>
<P>
 Brightly colored posters of the rain forest's dense foliage line Greycloud's 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Dried remains of two-inch-long beetles and other jungle insects lie in a glass 
case for children's inspection. And tiny terrariums that model the rain 
forest's ecosystem sit in the classroom's windows. 
</P>
<P>
 But Greycloud's lessons on the rain forest go beyond a typical science 
curriculum that examines different types of jungle species. 
</P>
<P>
 She urges her students to consider the threat to such animals as the 
white-faced monkey or fruit-eating bat, and then to do something about it. As 
the giant blue-and-yellow banner above her blackboard declares: "Save the 
Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 The message seems to be getting through. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of eighth-graders who first learned last year about the rain forest in 
Greycloud's class spent several days recently hawking T-shirts for $13.50 
apiece outside the school cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 They sold 138 shirts, raising enough funds to "adopt" 16 acres of rain forest 
in Belize. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a program run by the nonprofit Texas-based Earth Foundation, the 
educational arm of the Nature Conservancy, the money from Anacapa is going 
toward replanting and maintenance of a 229,000-acre rain forest preserve in 
Belize. In all, 3,000 American schools are helping save about 5 million 
forested acres around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 That is only a fraction of the 76 million acres lost each year, according to 
San Francisco-based Rainforest Action Network. And it compares to 1.8 billion 
acres remaining worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The T-shirts sold at Anacapa, and furnished by the Earth Foundation, feature 
lifelike pictures of tigers and other jungle animals or sport written slogans 
such as "Recycle or Die." 
</P>
<P>
 One shirt went to seventh-grader Noah Gordon, who said he looks forward to 
being in eighth grade next year so that he can join the fund-raising committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm mostly thinking about all the animals," the 13-year-old said. "I'm 
worried about all the animals in there becoming extinct. I want to be a 
zoologist when I grow up, but there might not be any animals left to study." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Noah's classmates share his grim outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plants and animals are becoming extinct, like, basically every day," 
13-year-old Matt Stanger said. And the corporations and people who are burning 
or cutting the rain forest "are just doing it 'cause they want money. They 
don't care." 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with facts they have learned in Greycloud's class, several children said 
they are concerned about possible global warming caused by the carbon dioxide 
that is released when rain forests are burned. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're ruining the ozone by burning it down," 13-year-old Travis Dasnoit 
said. "And it's taking away animals' homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the outlook for the rain forest warrants concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Although rain forests now cover 6% of the Earth's land area, they used to 
cover 14% and will vanish within 20 years at the current rate of destruction, 
Earth Foundation reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the burning or cutting of rain forests to clear land for cattle 
grazing, farming, mining or just to harvest wood has destroyed 52% of the 
tropical forests in Africa, 42% in Asia, 37% in Central America and 36% in the 
Amazon, the environmental group says. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with such statistics, people feel helpless, said Sandy Doss, Earth 
Foundation's educational coordinator. The pessimism is particularly common 
among children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people, when they see all this, they think, 'How can I do anything about 
all that? I have no way to make an impact there,' " Doss said. "So they shut 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 And, she said, "if you do a survey of what kids think environmentally, usually 
the response is very dismal. Their attitude of what things are going to look 
like in 10 to 15 years is pretty bad." 
</P>
<P>
 The best antidote for such a gloomy outlook, Doss said, is action, taking 
small steps to try to save the rain forest such as Greycloud's students are 
doing at Anacapa. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the T-shirt sales, Greycloud plans a letter-writing campaign by 
her seventh-graders. One target: Mitsubishi Corp., which has been cutting rain 
forests in Asia for packaging material. 
</P>
<P>
 Such student activism sparks a sense of hope and purpose among students, Doss 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call it problem-solving," she said. "It gives them ownership. It gives 
them problem-solving skills." 
</P>
<P>
 Although destruction of the rain forest may seem a heavy topic for middle 
school students, such lessons may be a key to the problem's solution, some 
students said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The adults, they're not really learning about it," Travis said. "They need 
somebody to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as Noah said: "It kind of makes you think."

STREET SMART: NEIGHBORS ARE LIKELY TO BLAME FOR SPEEDING PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 We have a major speeding problem in the Sunset Hills area of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble is especially acute off Erbes Road at the intersection of McCrea 
Road and Cumulus Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The speed limit is 25 m.p.h., but cars routinely pass our house going as fast 
as 45 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 A curving hill on McCrea only makes matters worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of us in the neighborhood have children who play in the streets. 
Admittedly, none has been killed or injured. But we all cringe when another car 
comes roaring down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem is that cars turning left from Cumulus onto McCrea have a hard 
time seeing these fast downhill cars because of the curves in the road. Large 
parked vehicles add to the sight difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
 What can be done to slow these cars down? (One patrol car with a radar gun 
could make a small fortune!) 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce E. Pritchard 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Look around at some of those cringing neighbors. They themselves may well be 
the speeders who vex you, says Jeff Knowles, Thousand Oaks assistant traffic 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 McCrea is entirely residential, Knowles says, so those driving on it are most 
likely headed for homes within your community. 
</P>
<P>
 In cases like this, Knowles says, often the best way to handle the problem is 
to take it to the homeowners association so that the speeders can be identified 
and asked to slow down. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as the city is concerned, Knowles says he will have the speed at the 
intersection monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 If cars regularly exceed the posted limit, he will report the results to the 
county sheriff, who can then post a cruiser at the intersection to ticket 
violators. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowles says he will also check to see if an inordinate number of vans and 
recreational vehicles are parking at the intersection and hindering visibility. 
If so, the city can post signs prohibiting tall vehicles from parking there. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I've noticed on California 33 that there is a new left-turn lane for 
southbound traffic at Creek Lane near Oak View. 
</P>
<P>
 This had been a dangerous place to turn, so the lane is a welcome addition. 
</P>
<P>
 There is another, equally dangerous left turn from the highway at nearby 
Sulphur Mountain Road that could also use a separate lane. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents who live on flood-prone Old Creek Road rely on Sulphur Mountain 
Road about half of the year, when the water on our road is too high to cross. 
</P>
<P>
 But without a left-turn lane, turns from the highway onto Sulphur Mountain 
Road can be treacherous. It is especially dangerous during peak traffic 
periods, at night and when it rains. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know how many accidents have occurred here, but there are always skid 
marks at the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 We need help in the form of a left-turn lane. Any chance we'll get one? 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Moore 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 There just isn't enough traffic on Sulphur Mountain Road to justify the cost 
of adding a special left-turn lane, says Luu Nguyen, engineer with the state 
Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent eight-hour period, Caltrans counted just 15 vehicles turning 
left, including a police car and a garbage truck, Nguyen says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adding a left-turn lane would be a costly project," he said. "With such a low 
traffic volume and so many other projects waiting to be funded, it is not 
something we can take on." 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen suggests that you urge the county to clear Old Creek Road to keep it 
from flooding. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I drive on Ventura Road from Port Hueneme into Oxnard every day of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 I assume this is one of Oxnard's busiest corridors, next to Oxnard Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, I have noticed that the signals on Ventura Road are not 
synchronized. This is especially problematic at small intersections such as 7th 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Frequently, as many as 30 cars will pass through a large intersection, only to 
be stopped by a red light at the next intersection for no apparent reason. 
</P>
<P>
 I realize cities have a reduced budget these days, but I can't understand why 
they don't synchronize the signals on Ventura Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Hathaway 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to what you think you are experiencing, the signals on Ventura Road 
are synchronized, Traffic Engineer Joe Genovese says. 
</P>
<P>
 Genovese acknowledges, however, that motorists may not always see green light 
after green light when cruising down this main thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Because setting the traffic light timing on big streets such as Ventura 
Road is complex, controlled by a computer that makes constant adjustments to 
correspond with the traffic flow, Genovese says. 
</P>
<P>
 The driving ease of motorists is just one of many factors the computer 
considers, he says. For example, the timing changes dramatically when a 
pedestrian crosses the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Other factors include spacing of the signals, speed of the traffic and the 
needs of motorists on side streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Increasing the green time on Ventura Road would be to the detriment of 
traffic waiting on the side streets," Genovese said. "One of our goals is to 
reduce overall delay to all users of the system."

VENTURA LIFTS HIRING FREEZE TO MAINTAIN POLICE FORCE; LAW ENFORCEMENT: PANEL 
AUTHORIZES REPLACING THREE OR FOUR RETIRING OFFICERS, BUT SOME VIEW MOVE AS 
FIRST STEP TOWARD UNNEEDED EXPANSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Complaining that he has five officers on sick leave, others exhausted from 
working record amounts of overtime and increasing crime problems, Ventura 
Police Chief Richard Thomas has won permission from a City Council committee to 
lift an 18-month hiring freeze. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason I'm here -- I'm telling you this from the bottom of my heart 
-- is I don't think we're able to provide the proper level of safety and hold 
it together much longer," he told the Finance Committee last week. "There are 
some things in city business that can be deferred and others that can't. A 911 
call can't." 
</P>
<P>
 In response, the committee authorized Thomas to make three or four new hires 
in anticipation of three or four officers retiring within the next year. Two of 
the committee members said they will push to keep the police force at its 
present level of 116 sworn officers, rather than following through in July with 
a plan to cut the force to 114 officers. 
</P>
<P>
 But some city officials say Thomas is exaggerating his troubles to raise 
staffing levels back to 122 officers -- the size of the force before council 
members made cuts last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very political move, and it's only the beginning," said one 
official, who asked not to be named. "I don't think there's any stopping him." 
</P>
<P>
 "He can take advantage of the situation because public sentiment is behind 
him," another official said. "But I think the resources are already there to 
get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 But Thomas said he is responding to widespread public concern about the city's 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everywhere I go, public safety comes up in the community," he said. "This 
isn't something I'm making up. I don't have any delusions of grandeur. I'm not 
trying to build an empire at the Ventura Police Department. I'm just trying to 
be the chief of police." 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to other local law enforcement agencies, Ventura has one of the most 
robust departments in the county. Some facts about the Police Department are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ventura has one officer for every 836 residents. By comparison, Oxnard has 
one officer for every 937 residents, and Thousand Oaks pays for one officer for 
every 1,222 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 * The city's starting pay for sworn officers -- between $2,800 and $3,450 a 
month -- is about average for the county. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Police Department commands nearly one-third of the city's operating 
budget, as compared to Thousand Oaks -- the third-safest city in the United 
States among cities with populations of 100,000 or more -- which spends just 
over a quarter of its budget on police. 
</P>
<P>
 * The overall crime rate in Ventura is down, with violent crimes dropping by 
13% between 1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said he is not trying to imply that Ventura is facing any crisis -- but 
by taking action now, he said, he hopes to prevent crime from increasing in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to make sure Ventura stays the neat community it is," he said. 
"Whatever it takes, I want to make sure that Ventura never gets to the point 
that L. A. or Fresno or any other crime-ridden city is. That's where my heart 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas and his department enjoy the support of many residents -- especially 
downtown merchants, who have been clamoring for more foot patrols to combat a 
transient problem in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think (the department) has enough officers," said Ed Warren, who owns 
downtown's Busy Bee Cafe. "The council needs to support the Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members say that message comes through loud and clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public says law enforcement and safety is their No. 1 concern," 
Councilman Steve Bennett said. "If that's the case, no way would I support 
cutting the police budget." 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing the Police Department to retain two officers in July, rather than 
losing the positions to attrition, will require cutting more than $100,000 out 
of other city budgets, Bennett said. But he said the prospect does not daunt 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am comfortable that we will find the money for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officeholders, both past and present, say local politicians can pay a 
dear price for showing any willingness to consider restraining costs at the 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gary Tuttle voted for cuts in the police budget when the council 
slashed expenditures citywide in mid-1993. Five months later, when the city had 
its elections that November, Tuttle got the least votes of the four candidates 
elected to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this doesn't become a contentious thing like it did last time, in the 
elections," he said. "They came out pretty hard against me then. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police are very strong in this city," he said. "But I hope they support 
the council this time and don't attack it." 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Collart, who was also on the council in the summer of 1993, also voted 
for cuts in the police budget. But Collart was not reelected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the endorsement of the police union when I ran the first time, and I 
didn't have it the second time," he said. "You put two and two together." 
</P>
<P>
 But Thomas says he is not twisting arms, only pointing out what a critical 
situation he faces. Between supervising storefronts on the Avenue and in 
Montalvo and meeting other, various requests to step up service around the 
city, he said his officers are driving themselves into exhaustion from working 
too much overtime. Without the ability to make new hires, the police force's 
effectiveness will continue to diminish, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last thing we want milling around is a bunch of tired, cranky police 
officers," he said. "It's getting to the point where there's too much of it. 
They're more subject to illness and to injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 Some city skeptics point out that Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks and Oxnard make 
do with less than Ventura has. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thomas counters that the east county cities are inherently safer because 
their population is wealthier and the cities are newer, with no aging, 
declining areas such as Ventura Avenue. As for Oxnard, he said, it's no 
accident that it has both less officers per resident than Ventura and a higher 
crime rate than Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, Thomas' arguments are falling on receptive ears at City Hall. 
Councilman Gregory L. Carson, who also voted for the police budget cuts last 
year and who is up for reelection in November, 1995, said he understands the 
importance of supporting the city's employees in blue. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are an integral part of our promoting tourism," said Carson, a big 
tourism booster. "We want to make sure they are on board. It's a joint 
partnership with the city."

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I've noticed on California 33 that there is a new left-turn lane for 
southbound traffic at Creek Lane near Oak View. 
</P>
<P>
 This had been a dangerous place to turn, so the lane is a welcome addition. 
</P>
<P>
 There is another, equally dangerous left turn from the highway at nearby 
Sulphur Mountain Road that could also use a separate lane. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents who live on flood-prone Old Creek Road rely on Sulphur Mountain 
Road about half of the year, when the water on our road is too high to cross. 
</P>
<P>
 But without a left-turn lane, turns from the highway onto Sulphur Mountain 
Road can be treacherous. It is especially dangerous during peak traffic 
periods, at night and when it rains. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know how many accidents have occurred here, but there are always skid 
marks at the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 We need help in the form of a left-turn lane. Any chance we'll get one? 
</P>

 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 There just isn't enough traffic on Sulphur Mountain Road to justify the cost 
of adding a special left-turn lane, says Luu Nguyen, engineer with the state 
Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent eight-hour period, Caltrans counted just 15 vehicles turning 
left, including a police car and a garbage truck, Nguyen says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adding a left-turn lane would be a costly project," he said. "With such a low 
traffic volume and so many other projects waiting to be funded, it is not 
something we can take on." 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen suggests that you urge the county to clear Old Creek Road to keep it 
from flooding. 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart:

 I drive on Ventura Road from Port Hueneme into Oxnard every day of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 I assume this is one of Oxnard's busiest corridors, next to Oxnard Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, I have noticed that the signals on Ventura Road are not 
synchronized. This is especially problematic at small intersections such as 7th 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Frequently, as many as 30 cars will pass through a large intersection, only to 
be stopped by a red light at the next intersection for no apparent reason. 
</P>
<P>
 I realize cities have a reduced budget these days, but I can't understand why 
they don't synchronize the signals on Ventura Road.

 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to what you think you are experiencing, the signals on Ventura Road 
are synchronized, Traffic Engineer Joe Genovese says. 
</P>
<P>
 Genovese acknowledges, however, that motorists may not always see green light 
after green light when cruising down this main thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Because setting the traffic light timing on big streets such as Ventura 
Road is complex, controlled by a computer that makes constant adjustments to 
correspond with the traffic flow, Genovese says. 
</P>
<P>
 The driving ease of motorists is just one of many factors the computer 
considers, he says. For example, the timing changes dramatically when a 
pedestrian crosses the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Other factors include spacing of the signals, speed of the traffic and the 
needs of motorists on side streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Increasing the green time on Ventura Road would be to the detriment of 
traffic waiting on the side streets," Genovese said. "One of our goals is to 
reduce overall delay to all users of the system." 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 We have a major speeding problem in the Sunset Hills area of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble is especially acute north of Erbes Road at the intersection of 
McCrea Road and Cumulus Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The speed limit is 25 m.p.h., but cars routinely pass our house going as fast 
as 45 m.p.h. A curving hill on McCrea only makes matters worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of us in the neighborhood have children who play in the streets. 
Admittedly, none has been killed or injured. But we all cringe when another car 
comes roaring down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem is that cars turning left from Cumulus onto McCrea have a hard 
time seeing these fast downhill cars because of the curves in the road. Large 
parked vehicles add to the sight difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
 What can be done to slow these cars down? (One patrol car with a radar gun 
could make a small fortune!) 
</P>

 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Look around at some of those cringing neighbors. They themselves may well be 
the speeders who vex you, says Jeff Knowles, Thousand Oaks assistant traffic 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 McCrea is entirely residential, Knowles says, so those driving on it are most 
likely headed for homes within your community. 
</P>
<P>
 In cases like this, Knowles says, often the best way to handle the problem is 
to take it to the homeowners association so that the speeders can be identified 
and asked to slow down. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as the city is concerned, Knowles says he will have the speed at the 
intersection monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 If cars regularly exceed the posted limit, he will report the results to the 
county sheriff, who can then post a cruiser at the intersection to ticket 
violators. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowles says he will also check to see if an inordinate number of vans and 
recreational vehicles are parking at the intersection and hindering visibility. 
If so, the city can post signs prohibiting tall vehicles from parking there.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; HONOR FARM TO MODERNIZE ITS HOG FACILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County officials want to prevent polluted water from reaching underground 
aquifers by modernizing hog-raising operations at the Sheriff's Honor Farm near 
Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Water agencies and environmentalists in the past have claimed that nitrates 
from pig manure spread at the farm were seeping into nearby aquifers, Sheriff's 
Cmdr. Dante Honorico said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those wells feed into the Ventura River, raising concerns about pollution and 
threats to endangered wildlife that nests and forages in the river habitat. But 
the changes at the honor farm should end those concerns, Honorico said. 
</P>
<P>
 Five new hog pens totaling 11,280 square feet will replace two aging pens, 
which will be demolished, he said. The new pens are designed to divert waste 
from the hogs into flushing gutters, Honorico said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, honor farm workers will adhere to stringent rules limiting the 
amount of manurespread over the pasture, he said. Other improvements, such as 
installation of trailer-type classrooms and construction of a greenhouse, are 
also planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The honor farm is a minimum-security facility that houses about 212 men and 
women serving time for nonviolent offenses. Inmates care for 50 cattle and 
1,300 pigs on the farm, Honorico said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides improving its livestock operations, the Sheriff's Department is asking 
for permission to more than double the inmate population. But Honorico said it 
is not likely the farm will ever fill its barracks with 460 inmates. "We just 
want to be ready in case we start to see an increase in the inmate population," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, which requires a zoning change from agricultural to open space, 
was approved by the county's Planning Commission recently. It is expected to 
come before the Board of Supervisors for final approval Dec. 6, said Honorico, 
who is supervising the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Honorico said he has no preliminary estimate on the total cost of the project. 
But at least $17,000 will be spent to build a road leading to classrooms used 
by the inmates and to supply the farm with fire hydrants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A $65,000 barn where sows give birth is being built and paid for by the Oxnard 
High Union School District. Teachers from the district will instruct inmates on 
how to raise the livestock, Honorico said. 
</P>
<P>
 Money to pay for the project will come out of the Sheriff Department's general 
fund, he said. KAY SAILLANT

<P>
 A Hollywood Beach man armed with a shotgun held police at bay for more than 
six hours until negotiators talked him into surrendering, sheriff's officials 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Eugene Graves, 43, barricaded himself inside a beachfront home about 
10:15 p.m. Saturday, threatening to shoot himself because he was distraught 
over personal problems, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Sheriff's Department Special Weapons and Tactics team 
responded to the Los Robles Street residence, where Graves gave himself up 
about 4:30 Sunday morning, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was taken to a mental health facility for observation. JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: 5 'DEADBEAT PARENTS' ON POSTER ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five parents profiled on a wanted poster from the Ventura County district 
attorney's office have been arrested for failing to pay child support. 
</P>
<P>
 The most-wanted "deadbeat parents" poster spotlighting the county's worst 
suspected offenders was released Sept. 28.Since then, investigators have 
located four parents and another has turned himself in, Deputy Dist. Atty. C. 
Stanley Trom said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators arrested Jose Luis Leon, William Matuzak, Frances Quintana and 
Pedro Flores Villareal for failing to make child support payments. Miguel Angel 
Guevara turned himself in at Ventura County Municipal Court after seeing his 
photograph on the poster, Trom said. 
</P>
<P>
 The five parents owed more than $350,000 in court-ordered support payments, 
Trom said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office has also received tips on the whereabouts of 
two other parents profiled on the poster, the fourth in a series to be 
displayed at grocery stores, banks and police stations throughout Ventura 
County, the prosecutor said. JEFF McDONALD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The deadline to apply for earthquake disaster assistance has been extended to 
Jan. 20, three days after the one-year anniversary of the Northridge quake, 
federal and state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The extension applies to applications for assistance from the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency's housing assistance program, the 
state-administered Individual and Family Grant Program, and the Small Business 
Administration's disaster loan programs for homeowners, renters and business 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the final extension of the application period for the Northridge 
earthquake," said Frank Kishton, federal coordinating officer. "There will not 
be another extension." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents may register for assistance at any earthquake service center or by 
calling (800) 462-9029. Residents with hearing and speech disabilities should 
call (800) 462-7585. CHRISTINA LIMA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; COUNCIL MAY DEDICATE SEATS TO 
RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Eager to honor residents who have poured energy into building Thousand Oaks, 
Mayor Alex Fiore has proposed dedicating several seats in the council chamber 
to outstanding citizens each year. 
</P>
<P>
 To kick off the program, Fiore hopes to honor four longtime residents and 
community activists.The council will vote Tuesday on his list, which includes: 
</P>
<P>
 * Virginia Davis, the city's longest-serving planning commissioner. She now 
serves as chairman of the Board of Governors of the Civic Arts Plaza, which 
sets policy on programming, budgeting and funding of the new theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 * Marilyn Carpenter, a planning commissioner. Serving on many key committees 
over the years, Carpenter helped craft freeway design standards, draw up the 
city's blueprint for growth and lobby the state for more educational funding. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jerry Knotts, a businessman who has been a major booster of Cal Lutheran 
University over the years. Knotts has also been active with various service 
clubs, charitable groups and arts organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Raymond Olson, a former president of Cal Lutheran who has long been active 
in civic activities. A member of Alliance for the Arts, he led the decades-long 
fight for a performance center. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore has proposed that future councils dedicate one or two seats each year, 
based on specific criteria to be drawn up by a committee.

 "It's a nice thing to do," Councilwoman Judy Lazar agreed. "I don't think 
every Tom, Dick and Harry who comes down the pike deserves a seat dedicated in 
his name, but certainly people who have invested a lot of time in the community 
should be recognized." STEPHANIE SIMON

VALLEY CHRONICLE: THE LIGHT OF THEIR LOVE -- AND WORK -- SHINES FOR THE HOLIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As a studio prop man, Joe Valentino has built creations such as a 
110-foot-long, three-masted schooner for the movie, "Goonies," and the 
intricate consoles for the Starship Enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he has a new gig going in his state-of-the-art home workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 He has created thousands of lighted, six-point Hanukkah stars in time for the 
Jewish Festival of Lights that begins Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Strange avocation for a nice Catholic boy. 
</P>
<P>
 To understand, flash back about 20 years to when Valentino and Ronni Van Gorp, 
nee Hoerner, met while cruising Van Nuys Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 They dated for a while, but then Van Gorp, who was attending El Camino High 
School, and her Polytechnic sweetheart parted company. Each married other 
people. Each divorced. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago they ran into each at the Calabasas Sagebrush Cantina. 
</P>
<P>
 Love is better the second time around, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe and his 13-year-old son, Michael, have been invited to the house of Van 
Gorp's family in West Hills on festive occasions, including the lighting of 
candles and gift exchanges during Hanukkah. 
</P>
<P>
 During one of the dinners several years ago Joe noticed an old, two-foot, blue 
and silver Hanukkah star that Van Gorp's father, Jerry Hoerner, had made for 
his family more than 30 years before. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Gorp told Valentino that when she and her two brothers moved out of the 
house, her dad had made one for each of them, "to go." 
</P>
<P>
 An idea was born. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stars are decorations that brighten the home during the holiday season," 
explains Van Gorp. "Joe was so interested in them that he and I decided to make 
some two years ago and sell them at Jewish temple holiday boutiques." 
</P>
<P>
 They did, and their success prompted to them to broaden their market. This 
year, they made more than 2,000 of the stars, which each cost about $50, for 
sale through mail order and at stores such as Abi's Judaica & Gifts in Tarzana 
and Cherish in the Promenade Mall in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she thought it was odd that half of the Hanukkah Star Productions 
team is not Jewish, but Catholic, Van Gorp laughs and says their personal 
relationship is a bit of familial deja vu. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom and dad met in Hollywood during the war at a dance for servicemen. He 
was Catholic and my mother is Jewish," Van Gorp says. "He converted when they 
married and he became as active at Congregation Beth Kodesh as she is." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the couple has not set a wedding date, Valentino says it's in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the business, Van Gorp has only one problem: How to repay her father 
for being the creative impetus. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me to give him a kiss for every star we sold," says Van Gorp. "I'm 
kissing him a lot these days." Amid Cramped Quarters, A Lively Scene Unfolds 
</P>
<P>
 There's plenty of drama onstage at the Interact Theatre in North Hollywood, 
where John Rubinstein is starring in the production of Elmer Rice's 1931 
oeuvre, "Counselor-at-Law." 
</P>
<P>
 In front of the footlights, everything is choreographed to the split second. 
</P>
<P>
 Backstage, chaos reigns. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not about the cast being contentious, unruly and lacking discipline. It's 
not about two leads doing the star-trip boogie routine. It is about 26 cast 
members getting ready in two tiny dressing rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Annie Abbott of Van Nuys is one of the cast members. You may have seen her on 
television playing a judge on "L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
 She likens what goes on backstage each Friday and Saturday night, with 
matinees on Sunday, to the area under the basket in a Knicks-Lakers game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The women's dressing room is small, but the men's dressing room is tiny. I'm 
always amazed to see people emerge with their costumes and makeup on," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of the travails, the cast is grateful to perform for a live audience, 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us have done Broadway, and we need a continuing theater fix," she 
adds. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to productions, Abbott says, the Interact Theatre group hosts 
open, impromptu readings every Monday and a writing on Tuesdays. Both are open 
to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also sponsors a youth theater on Saturdays. Two members of that 
workshop -- teen-agers Victor Duran and Freddy Otero -- have parts in 
"Counselor-at-Law," which runs through Dec. 18. We're Getting Up There On The 
Food Chain 
</P>
<P>
 A space alien questioning a Westsider about where to dine out on this end of 
the planet would probably be told about interesting places in almost any area 
of Los Angeles, except the Valley, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Westsiders, here's some restaurant news to chew over. Check out the 1995 
Zagat Survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The prestigious wining and dining directory gives high marks to a wealth of 
Valley restaurants, including Bistro Garden at Coldwater and Sushi Nozawa, both 
in Studio City, Saddle Peak Lodge in Calabasas and even the ubiquitous 
California Pizza Kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 But what will fry our gourmandizing over-the-hill cousins is that the 
Calabasas-based chain of The Cheesecake Factory restaurants scored higher than 
Wolfgang Puck's Spago. Overheard

OVER -- AND DONE WITH -- THE HILL; WITH STINGING ONE-LINERS AND BIPARTISAN 
BARBS, CONGRESSMAN FRED GRANDY IS RILING UP THE GRAND OLD PARTY BY REFUSING TO 
GO QUIETLY INTO THE NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SLAVIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fred Grandy was not running for reelection and it showed. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking more Beverly Hills than Capitol Hill, the Iowa Congressman and former 
television actor appeared for an interview in a blazer whose color he described 
as "bitchin' burgundy." 
</P>
<P>
 Grandy suggested the interview be conducted on a park bench to take advantage 
of an unseasonably warm day just before the Nov. 8 elections. Then he proceeded 
to do what he's been doing lately, to the chagrin of his Republican party 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 The party, he complained, "is so damn humorless. We don't need William Kristol 
(the political strategist). We need Billy Crystal." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as polls began predicting a Republican landslide, Grandy refused to get 
on-board. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, he compared the Republicans' "Contract With America" to snake 
oil and called House GOP leaders "mean-spirited, angry, petulant schoolboys." 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to a picture of Georgia Rep. Newt Gingrich, the soon-to-be House 
Speaker, he asked a reporter for the Des Moines Register, "Would you want your 
daughter to marry this guy?" It was a comment that received wide attention on 
the Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 One-liners have come easily to Grandy, 46, since long before he came to 
Washington in 1986 and discovered it was no Love Boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Sioux City, Iowa, to wealthy parents who died one year apart and left 
him an orphan at 13, he has traveled to Harvard, Hollywood and the Hill in an 
odyssey that has made him difficult to characterize. 
</P>
<P>
 His varied experiences have endowed him with a vocabulary that includes such 
words as mediageneity and fakakta (a Yiddish vulgarism), both of which he 
inserted casually into the interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the problem with Iowa: Not enough people speak Yiddish," cracked 
Grandy, a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant. Then he launched into an impersonation 
of Jewish comedian Jackie Mason campaigning in a grain elevator. 
</P>
<P>
 Oy hay. 
</P>
<P>
 Grandy started acting at Harvard, where he appeared with Jane Curtin and 
others in a long-running satirical review, "The Proposition." 
</P>
<P>
 He learned his Yiddishisms in New York, where he went through the 
struggling-actor stage and appeared off-Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hollywood, he played Maude's daughter's boyfriend and then Gopher, the 
nebbishy cruise ship purser, on the long-running series "The Love Boat." 
</P>
<P>
 An accident in Turkey in 1982 -- when someone lighted a cigarette in a cab and 
a hydrogen balloon blew up in his face, causing him to suffer some burns -- 
helped Grandy decide to leave show business. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he also wanted to accomplish something for the people of Iowa, where 
his family has roots that go back more than a century, and in a sense prove 
himself to his parents even though they were no longer living. 
</P>
<P>
 Sent to Washington after a hard-fought campaign, Grandy quickly lived down the 
Gopher image, earning a reputation for thoughtful, serious work and 
bipartisanship. 
</P>
<P>
 He took on all the "ugly baby" issues, a House staffer said, such as crop 
insurance, commodity futures trading and the House banking scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Grandy also tackled health care in this year's thankless debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a very thoughtful guy who is policy-oriented and not prone to knee-jerk 
reactions," said Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands). 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of the most intelligent members to come to the House in many, many 
years," agreed Jim Leach, a fellow moderate Iowa Republican who gained 
attention for promoting the House investigation of the Whitewater scandal. 
"When health care came up, there were no real experts on it in the House. 
Through diligence and application, he became one." 
</P>
<P>
 With Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) and others, Grandy sponsored a bipartisan 
compromise bill, but it never came to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "The leadership of the Congress couldn't stand it that someone possibly had a 
better idea," Leach said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grandy criticized the Democrats for squelching debate, telling a Los Angeles 
Times congressional reporter this summer: "The Democrats' definition of 
bipartisanship is 'Vote for our bill and we'll give you a cookie.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent months, he has lobbed more stink bombs at the other side of the 
aisle, his tongue loosened by defeat in a primary against Iowa Republican Gov. 
Terry Branstad. 
</P>
<P>
 Grandy defied his state party leadership in challenging Branstad, a three-term 
incumbent. He attracted significant independent and crossover Democratic 
support, but lost by 11,000 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Defeat was humbling for a man with an admittedly large ego, but it was also 
liberating. 
</P>
<P>
 After eight years at a place he compares to a never-ending graduate school, he 
began broadcasting the criticisms he had been sharing quietly with a selected 
few. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the twilight of my political career, why not at least say that none of the 
emperors has any clothes?" Grandy said. "The problem is the hypocrisy. We spend 
half our time criticizing the Democrats and the other half imitating every move 
they make." 
</P>
<P>
 The crack about Gingrich, he said, was made after the Republican leader 
bragged that if his party took control of the House, it would inundate the 
White House with investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thought of spending two years firing off subpoenas in lieu of health care 
reform or meaningful entitlement reform or campaign finance reform is an 
absolute travesty," Grandy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling the McCarthy era, when Republicans last had control of Congress, he 
warned that if Gingrich carried out his threats, "the Republicans would go into 
a kind of exile from which they would never emerge." 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich declined comment on Grandy's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Dick Armey (R-Tex.), the soon-to-be majority leader, accused Grandy of 
trying to become a Democrat and of refusing to accept any idea that wasn't his 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the charge of Republican humorlessness, Armey said: "Without a sense of 
humor, we would have never been able to tolerate Fred Grandy for as long as 
we've done." 
</P>
<P>
 Grandy's glibness may come in handy in a town now teeming with out-of-work 
politicians, mostly Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he hoped to continue some form of public service through the media, 
academics, the nonprofit area or a free-lance career "where I'm lecturing, 
writing and electronically terrifying people periodically." 
</P>
<P>
 Grandy, who remains attractive if no longer a baby-faced male ingenue in short 
pants, didn't preclude a return to show business. He noted that the most job 
satisfaction he had experienced lately was when he and his wife, Catherine 
Mann, an author and former television reporter, performed the play "Love 
Letters" to benefit Iowa youth without health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "For all of my yapping on health care, I'm doing more doing this show with you 
than I ever will over here (on Capitol Hill)," Grandy said he told his wife at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Grandy, who once called his old TV series asinine, said he had come to 
appreciate what he called its "wonderful kind of sweetness." 
</P>
<P>
 "Good, clean, but not necessarily intellectually stimulating entertainment is 
a hell of a lot more harmless than a lot of what goes on on this sound stage," 
he said, gesturing toward the Capitol a few hundred yards away. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, he said, if "we're talking, 'The Love Boat: The Next 
Generation,' the answer is, 'Pass.' 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'd really like to do is portray a new alien on the next 'Star Trek' 
series, since the Republicans have regarded me as an alien for the last couple 
of months anyway. I could play a guy with a long trunk and big ears who was 
afraid of mice and immigrants." Fred Grandy Comments on . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * The differences between Hollywood and Washington: "Washington is Hollywood 
with higher ceilings." 
</P>
<P>
 * Being a Congressman: "It's a great job for deviant human beings." 
</P>
<P>
 * Constituents: "They want Cadillac answers at Studebaker prices." 
</P>
<P>
 * Iowa Republican politics: "There's been more turnover at the Vatican." 
</P>
<P>
 * His party in general: "Republicans don't have a problem with substance. We 
have no style. It looks like we've had this collective bad hair day and we're 
just pissed all the time."

POODLE PATROL; SALLIE PERKINS KNOWS THE WORLD OF HURT. AND THAT'S WHAT DRIVES 
HER TO HEAL OTHERS IN PAIN -- ESPECIALLY THE ABANDONED DOGS WHO NEED HER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Matted hair falls in clumps over his eyes. His bark is loud but not fierce, 
and he turns cautious and shy as he is released from his pen at the Orange 
County Animal Shelter. Gently he moves toward Sallie Perkins and licks her 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 He was found four days earlier roaming the streets, wearing no identification. 
No one came to claim him, and Perkins knows how that must feel. 
</P>
<P>
 As a child, she was a victim of abuse: tied to a tree and horsewhipped, raped, 
locked in her room for weeks at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 And as a mother, she suffered the loss of 3-year-old twin daughters and her 
first husband, killed in a San Francisco car crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what it is to feel unwanted," she says. "I know what it's like to wish 
you were dead." 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, her life has been a process of healing and helping others to 
heal. Years ago, following the death of her daughters, she took in hundreds of 
children to assist in crisis intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 A former opera singer, actress, stand-up comic and nightclub performer, 
Perkins has sat with the elderly, holding their hands and singing "Shepherd 
Show Me How to Go" softly into their ears as they lay dying. 
</P>
<P>
 Past president of the Inter-Agency Council on Child Abuse and Neglect, 
Perkins, who lives adjacent to Beverly Hills, also helped raise money to build 
children's waiting rooms for the Los Angeles County Department of Children's 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
 What consumes her now is her role as an animal rights activist. She works 
full-time rescuing dogs, almost all of them poodles. Each year she places 500 
to 600 dogs in homes, which she screens carefully. At any given time, she is 
caring for upward of 75 poodles, spending up to $10,000 a month out of her 
savings to care for them. 
</P>
<P>
 She has driven through rain and riot to rescue these dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 One dog she adopted out was subsequently given to the circus, and when that 
didn't work out, the dog was given away. Perkins tracked the dog down and 
determined that the new owner did not meet her standards, so she grabbed the 
dog and stormed down the street in her Jaguar -- with the poodle riding shotgun 
and the woman pounding on her car. 
</P>
<P>
 It is more than an obsession, more than passion that motivates her. It's as 
if, she says, she can climb inside the soul of all living things who have been 
abused or are unwanted and feel their pain. And it is that pain that drives 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This shaggy, tangled mess of a standard poodle in Orange County will be 
beautiful once groomed and loved, Perkins says. He, like some of her other dogs 
of show quality, should easily be placed in a home. 
</P>
<P>
 There are others, however, like Baby -- old, blind and deaf. Or Arthur, with 
his incessant wheezing, who probably will never find homes no matter how many 
ribbons are placed in their hair. So Perkins will care for them until they die. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's get out of here," she says to the dog as she takes the leash. "Tonight, 
you'll be pooping in Beverly Hills." Such a prospect is enough to bring life to 
the meter of his tail, indicating he senses life is about to improve. 
</P>
<P>
 Perkins keeps tabs on 40 animal shelters throughout Southern California, 
taking in poodles that have been turned in or abandoned. She searches 
classified ads for dogs being given away or who are left unclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two-thirds of all dogs in this country lose their original homes through no 
fault of their own," she says. "Poodles are the fourth-highest killed in animal 
shelters." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of their overpopulation and because she has a special affection for 
the breed, Perkins focuses on poodles. 
</P>
<P>
 She was 16 years old and living in Santa Cruz when she rescued her first dog 
and owned her first poodle, Cleopatra. Soon she took in another, then another 
and before long had reached double figures. 
</P>
<P>
 It has, Perkins admits, grown out of control. It has become too much for one 
person to handle. She is on the road racing from shelter to shelter, delivering 
dogs to the vet, the groomer, the kennel. She buys their supplies, receives 50 
to 60 telephone calls a day from people wanting to adopt or give up dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyna Melgar, Perkins' housekeeper, helps with the animals during the day. She 
recently brought in a dog that was hit by a car. Perkins paid for surgery and 
found the dog a home. 
</P>
<P>
 At night, Perkins plows through paperwork, oftentimes until 2 or 3 a.m. Her 
savings will not support her work much longer, she says. Yet, she cannot stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Perkins also has taken over the New Hope for Animals Foundation, which 
provides vouchers to people who cannot afford to have their pets spayed or 
neutered. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the biggest shopping day of the year, she will be marching in the 
streets of Beverly Hills in an anti-fur demonstration sponsored by Last Chance 
for Animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes Sallie unique is her total devotion to saving animals' lives," 
says Caroline Rose, 73, owner of the Double E Kennel in Woodland Hills, where 
Perkins boards many of her dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "She will go way out on a limb, to the tip of the branch, to save an animal," 
says Rose, who has been rescuing dogs for 61 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perkins' poodles have sat on the laps of Hollywood's most famous stars. Her 
husband, Rowland, co-founded Creative Artists Agency (CAA), one of the most 
recognized entertainment agencies in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Married in 1979, Sallie and Rowland knew each other as children and were 
reunited while Sallie was a regular on the "Bert Convy Show," which Rowland 
packaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Sallie, who doesn't give out her age, also appeared as Mona the sex therapist 
on "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman," and has had roles on the "Dick Van Dyke Show," 
"Burke's Law," "Joey Bishop Show" and "The Beverly Hillbillies." 
</P>
<P>
 She performed as a stand-up comic, discovered by Shelley Berman. And she has 
sung -- and dined -- with Luciano Pavarotti. Her brother is stuntman Loren 
Janes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rowland Perkins is retired from CAA and starting his own production company. 
He and Sallie are plugged into the glitter circuit, so in evening gown and 
diamonds she often returns home to perform the mundane task of letting her dogs 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 And even though she boards dogs at Rose's kennel, where she has built 25 runs 
of her own, poodles are in and out of her house constantly as they are placed 
in permanent homes. 
</P>
<P>
 More than the glamour, more than the limelight, she hungers to be among the 
swarm of poodles, to check on Arthur's wheeze, on Peanut's shaken sense of 
well-being after getting a taste of Angel's territorial wrath. 
</P>
<P>
 She helps the older ones up and down the stairs, and when they have completed 
their business, she cleans up after them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am," she says, "the Queen of Poop."

COMMITMENTS; OK, IT'S A GUY THING -- BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?; LANGUAGE: THIS 
CATCHY, CONVENIENT PHRASE HAS SEVERAL HIDDEN MEANINGS. YOU'D THINK MEN COULD

 A man spits, or watches 11 hours of football, or howls as he and his buddies 
re-enact last night's episode of "Beavis and Butt-head." 
</P>
<P>
 The meaning of such behavior has puzzled women (and more than a few men) 
through the ages, but finally we have an answer: 
</P>
<P>
 It's a guy thing. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, but just one question. What does that mean? "It's a guy thing" may be a 
popular description of stereotypical male behavior, but that doesn't mean it 
can be easily defined -- perhaps because it's not supposed to be. 
</P>
<P>
 The phrase exists mainly so men don't have to explain why they do the things 
they do, and so women can avoid having to consider the nasty particulars. 
</P>
<P>
 Translation: It's a guy thing -- you wouldn't want to understand. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe the difficulty of defining this throwaway line is that men haven't 
given a whole lot of thought to their macho eccentricities, introspection not 
being at the top of the list of guy things. 
</P>
<P>
 As in: It's a guy thing. Even I don't understand. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, then, who does? Believe it or not, a lot of really smart people have 
given this phrase -- and its relation to understanding between the genders -- a 
lot of thought. Their thoughts range from theories of men redefining themselves 
in a post-feminist world to sheer amazement at the prodigious levels of male 
saliva output. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men, for no reason at all, seem to spit a lot. All I can say, besides 
'Gross!' is, 'Hey, it's a guy thing,' " said Amy Guy (no relation) of Kenyon 
College in Gambier, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the phrase is the notion that certain activities, by nature or 
nurture, are particular to one sex, and perhaps not very well understood by the 
other. That may explain why you rarely hear the words shopping and belching in 
the same sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 There is at least one known fact: The meaning of "It's a guy thing" is in the 
mind of the beholder. 
</P>
<P>
 Men sometimes say it to women to try to explain the unexplainable. Any attempt 
to break it down any further would defeat its purpose. After all, nobody ever 
asks the French to explain " C'est la vie ." 
</P>
<P>
 It also may serve as an explanation for why men like to watch Monday Night 
Football together, in terms of a need for male bonding, said James Bracy, a 
social psychologist at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 When women use the phrase, they may truly be curious, searching for the 
Rosetta Stone of male behavior and hoping not to come up with the same old 
tabula rasa. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, in another interpretation, women may just want to mock male behavior, Guy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Kleinhans, an associate professor of radio, television and film at 
Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., said, "When men use 'It's a guy 
thing,' it means 'Don't bother me about this,' or 'You wouldn't understand.' 
When you hear a woman say it, it's to put down men." 
</P>
<P>
 An inability by men to articulate their "guyhood" to women may have something 
to do with the alleged male penchant for doing rather than saying, said Paul 
Somerville, who also claims to be the founder of the Department of Manliness at 
Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa. As an example, he cites a line by John 
Wayne, an archetypal guy's guy, from the movie "The Undefeated." 
</P>
<P>
 Woman: "You said you were going to talk to him, and you ended up killing him. 
Why?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne: "I guess the conversation just sorta dried up, ma'am." 
</P>
<P>
 So much for historical antecedents. 
</P>
<P>
 But why did this phrase come about now? The news, as usual, may not be good, 
fellas. It's another one of those the-dominant-male- 
going-the-way-of-the-dinosaurs deals, some theorists say. 
</P>
<P>
 Before feminism, men usually didn't have to try to explain their behavior -- 
their efforts to be the strongest, the toughest, the funniest, said Joe Urgo, 
associate professor of English and humanities at Bryant College in Smithfield, 
R.I. Male behavior was interpreted as human behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 But not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the catch phrase can be viewed as a welcome male self-consciousness, "a 
reassertion of the right to be a male heterosexual in an era that questions the 
primacy of that categorization," Urgo said. (Not that there aren't women and 
gay men who enjoy the manly arts of belching, hunting, designing tall buildings 
or starting wars.) 
</P>
<P>
 Or, said Marshall Fishwick, a professor of communication studies at Virginia 
Tech in Blacksburg: "It seems that 'the boys' want to reclaim some of their 
uniqueness that they gave up when 'girls' began to play baseball, become 
lawyers and fly F-14s." 
</P>
<P>
 Somerville ultimately defines the phrase in terms of what it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what a guy thing is, when all is said and done: A thing that guys can 
do that women can't (of which there is a decreasing number), don't (of which 
there is a slightly larger number) or won't (of which there is a rapidly 
increasing number) do," he concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Make any sense? If so, great. If not, well, you know. It's a guy thing.

 A man finds a genie who tells him, "I will give you anything you want, but 
then I must give your neighbor double." The man says, "OK, cut off my hand."

</P>
<P>
 You pick up your college alumni magazine and find that the guy who slept 
through history lectures while you took copious notes is now CEO of a 
multinational corporation. You grind your teeth and turn the page. 
</P>
<P>
 That's envy.  
</P>
<P>
 But what causes that private sense of elation, that smile hidden behind your 
lips, as you read that the Phi Beta Kappa football hero of years past has lost 
his career and family to a cocaine addiction and is living out of his car? 
</P>
<P>
 That's Schadenfreude.  
</P>
<P>
 Schadenfreude is the pleasure we deny in public and feel guilty about in 
private. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a German word that literally means feeling joy over someone's 
misfortune," says Joshua Halberstam, a professor of philosophy at New York 
University. "It's a very common feeling, although most people would probably 
say they don't experience it." 
</P>
<P>
 In his book, "Everyday Ethics" (Penguin, 1994), Halberstam outlines 
Schadenfreude as "part of the human condition." It becomes especially sensitive 
when we feel it toward our friends, making us wonder what kind of friends we 
are to others. "It doesn't necessarily mean you don't like the other person, or 
you don't care about their misfortune, you're just enjoying that it's not you," 
he says.  
</P>
<P>
 Schadenfreude drives gossip. If a couple in your group of friends announces a 
separation, that situation becomes the main topic of conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good to talk about it, to look at who's right and wrong," Halberstam 
says. "And the higher they are, the couple that seems to have everything 
together, the harder they fall and the better you feel." 
</P>
<P>
 If Schadenfreude were water, the city of Newport Beach would have been flooded 
in February, 1993, during one of the area's most notorious society scandals. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel and Susie Hernandez appeared to have it all. A successful sales 
representative for a company that refined precious metals, Daniel, his wife and 
two children traveled the world, were active in the Orange County social scene 
and were known for their lavish lifestyle. Their money came from real estate 
and precious metals investments, they told friends. They donated money and time 
to philanthropic causes, such as the Newport Harbor Art Museum where Susie 
served as a board member.  
</P>
<P>
 When Daniel turned 40, Susie threw a party at the Four Seasons Hotel in 
Newport Beach, inviting 110 people and giving each a souvenir bottle of 
champagne with Daniel's picture on the label. When Susie turned 40, Daniel 
presented her with a red Ferrari convertible. She opened the glove box and 
found a diamond bracelet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hernandezes were popular, which made the news one quiet Sunday morning so 
shocking. Daniel and Susie were arrested and charged with skimming money from 
Daniel's firm to pay for a lifestyle they couldn't otherwise afford. They 
pleaded guilty to tax evasion, mail fraud and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first thought was that the phone lines throughout Newport must be jammed," 
says Susan Shaw, who was at a society function with the Hernandezes shortly 
before their arrests.  
</P>
<P>
 If you're close to someone who's taken a fall, the feelings of Schadenfreude 
may be more intense. 
</P>
<P>
 "The closer you are, the more difficult those feelings can be," says Irene 
Goldenberg, a professor of psychology at UCLA. "If the lady down the street 
gets a purse you can't afford, you may feel distressed. If her purse is stolen, 
there's a sense of balance, the 'competition' between you has been evened up." 
</P>
<P>
 David Peete of Glendale knows about Schadenfreude all too well, even though he 
just learned the term. "So that's what you call it. I've always thought it was 
'just deserts.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Peete, a marketing manager for a clothing manufacturer, received his MBA three 
years ago from a Midwestern university. While in school, he and two members of 
his study group would dream about the companies they would start up and run 
when they got out. After graduation, Peete came home to Southern California and 
brought his dreams with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't get any offers out of school, but I just thought I'd land a job 
fairly quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he landed in the California recession and joined the ranks of other 
unemployed MBAs. He kept getting letters from his study pals about their great 
new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I began to hate opening the letters. I was really envious. I hungered for the 
chances they had." 
</P>
<P>
 But as the shine wore off his friends' jobs, Peete began to take some pleasure 
in their woes. 
</P>
<P>
 "One began having problems with his new boss and was eventually demoted. The 
other was put in charge of a big marketing project and failed miserably."  
</P>
<P>
 Peete, ironically, began to get some confidence from his friends' experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "That made me feel that maybe they weren't better than me, they were just 
luckier to get a good job before I did." 
</P>
<P>
 He turned his feelings of Schadenfreude into a positive, pounding harder on 
more doors to get job interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Peete found his current job shortly after, and realizes that he may now be the 
envy of his friends. "That's OK if they're envious. I was of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Turning Schadenfreude into a positive motivation is probably the most 
productive way to deal with it, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to remember that these feelings are OK, as long as you're not 
obsessed by them," UCLA's Goldenberg says. "They usually pass in and out of our 
minds, they show how inadequate or powerless we feel sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Feelings of Schadenfreude may be universal, but their intensity determines how 
damaging they can be. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can get ugly, especially on a national level," New York University's 
Halberstam says. "There's a real interest in learning about the dark side of 
our heroes." Halberstam believes that in some ways, Schadenfreude is 
celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's traditionally been looked down upon, but not anymore. We seem to 
celebrate someone's public fall, like O.J. Simpson's. I don't think this 
quality reflects well on our culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, who owns an aerobics apparel store in Newport Beach, has seen 
Schadenfreude in the business world. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one will admit it, but how many people look through the bankruptcy 
listings when they're published? 
</P>
<P>
 "One of our local papers publishes the names of those arrested for drunk 
driving. Our eyes scan it to check for the names of anyone we know. We're all 
morbidly curious." 
</P>
<P>
 Where would we be without Schadenfreude ? 
</P>
<P>
 "There would be no People magazine, no tabloids, no gossip," Halberstam says. 
"It may be a more idealistic world, but probably a little boring too."

SCR GETS SURPRISE GIFT FOR LATINO CHRISTMAS PLAY; STAGE: LILA WALLACE-READER'S 
DIGEST FUND WILL AWARD $80,000 TO HELP FINANCE THE WORLD PREMIERE OF 'LA POSADA 
MAGICA.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "La Posada Magica," a Latino Christmas play to open nextmonth at South Coast 
Repertory, has been awarded $80,000 by the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund to 
help finance the world premiere, theater officials will announce today. 
</P>
<P>
 Written by Octavio Solis, with a score by Marcos Loya, "La Posada Magica" 
tells the story of a teen-age girl who no longer feels the Christmas spirit but 
who finds a surprising renewal of hope. The play is loosely based on the Latin 
American tradition of the posada , a neighborhood procession to commemorate 
Mary and Joseph's search for an inn on the night she gives birth. 
</P>
<P>
 The windfall comes on top of an earlier $40,000 grant from the fund. That 
money was used to underwrite commissions for the script, the original music and 
development of the material supervised by Jose Cruz Gonzalez, head of SCR's 
Hispanic Playwrights Program, who will be directing the play on the troupe's 
Second Stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The latest grant is a great boon," Solis said upon learning of the award. "We 
would have had only two weeks of rehearsal without it, and frankly I wouldn't 
have been able to do what needs to be done. More time has freed up greater 
avenues for creativity. We've only been in rehearsals a week, and I'm already 
making a tremendous amount of revisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Solis, 36, a prolific playwright based in San Francisco, has had two plays 
developed through the Hispanic program: "Man of the Flesh," which received its 
1990 premiere on the SCR Second Stage (mounted since then in Dallas, Chicago, 
San Francisco and San Diego), and "La Illuminada," which SCR commissioned but 
did not produce. His "Scrappers" has toured secondary schools in Orange County 
as part of SCR's community outreach program. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Solis will direct another of his plays, "El Paso Blue," at San 
Diego Repertory. And in April, the Dallas Theatre Center will produce his 
"Santos & Santos," which recently won an incentive grant from the Kennedy 
Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'La Posada Magica' requires a childlike imagination to buy into it," Solis 
explained. "There's something at work, a kind of magic, that takes us all by 
surprise. I think the play transcends specific religious connotations, the 
whole Christian thing, because it has a universal resonance. So people of other 
religious persuasions can relate to it." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite all the religious imagery, he says, he has aimed for a secular 
tone. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a play for people who feel they've been left behind by Christmas," he 
added. "It's for people who feel they don't have anything to be happy about. 
There's such pressure at this time of year to be joyous, it's not a healthy 
thing. Terrible things still happen. Some families don't get along. Some people 
are lonely. Some don't have the money to buy presents. This is a play for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Loya, a Los Angeles composer, has written 10 songs (with lyrics by Solis) for 
"La Posada Magica." He will perform them with guitarist Lorenzo Martinez and 
other members of the company. Loya's music combines Latin and jazz influences 
and has been featured in various films, including "Stand and Deliver," "The 
Waterdance" and "Born in East L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the original songs and a few traditional Spanish carols, Solis said 
the show "works like a play with music" rather than a full-fledged musical. 
</P>
<P>
 The production will be designed by Cliff Faulkner (scenery), Shigeru Yaji 
(costumes) and Lonnie Rafael Alcaraz (lighting). Gonzalez will direct a cast of 
Edna Alvarez, Christine Avila, George Galvan, Ruth Livier, Phillip Daniel 
Rodriguez, Ruben Sierra, Vic Trevino and Teresa Velarde. 
</P>
<P>
 "La Posada Magica" begins previews Dec. 9 on the South Coast Repertory Second 
Stage, 655 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. The regular run is Dec. 14 to 24. $14 
(Dec. 9-11); $15-$19 (Dec. 13-18); $18-$22 (Dec. 20-24). (714) 957-4033.

BURST PIPE AND BIG TIDE FLOOD NEWPORT STREET; DELUGE: WATER FLOWS DOWN RIVER 
AVENUE AS RESIDENTS WATCH HELPLESSLY. SEVERAL PARKED CARS SUFFER THE MOST 
DAMAGE.

<P>
 To the dismay of many residents, River Avenue lived up to its name early 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting about 6 a.m., inhabitants watched helplessly as rapidly rising waters 
from a broken water main and an unusually high ocean tide flooded several 
parked cars and possibly undermined the foundations of some of the homes, 
according to witnesses and authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The broken pipe cut off all water to some residents for as long as 10 hours, 
witnesses said, and city crews dug up the pavement to isolate the damaged pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a river in front of my house," said Tony Nigro, who saw the water 
reach the front porch of his residence at 4106 River Ave. by 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Doug Thomas of the Newport Beach Police Department said an eight-inch 
broken water main and the high tide from a channel feeding from Newport Bay 
combined to cause the problems on River Avenue at 41st and 42nd streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the high tides, the storm drains were blocked and there was no 
place for the water to go, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
 River Avenue is two blocks from the Pacific Ocean and many of the houses on 
the street back up to a channel that winds around nearby Newport Island to the 
bay. Some of the homes, the street and the pipelines underground date back to 
the 1920s, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
 City workers late Sunday were trying to discover why the water pipe broke and 
determine how much damage was caused, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the water was shut off, work crews aided by water pumps, water trucks and 
a backhoe were forced to dig through the street, the sidewalks and the sandy 
soil to get to the damaged pipe, witnesses said. The crews worked into the 
night Sunday attempting to repair the pipe and clean up the mess, residents 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The flood was first discovered just after 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went out at about a quarter to seven to get my L.A. Times and I couldn't 
get outside," said Nigro, 39, a sales representative for a food manufacturer. 
"Besides the water, there was a ton of sand, about six feet deep in some 
areas." 
</P>
<P>
 The cars parked on the street suffered the most damage, said one unhappy 
overnight visitor, Peyton Schur. He said his Mercedes Benz was worth $90,000 -- 
before the flood. 
</P>
<P>
 "My new Mercedes was filled with water," said Schur, who spent the night at a 
friend's house on 42nd Street only to wake up and discover the damage. Schur 
said he found a shut-off valve several blocks away that city workers had 
trouble locating. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time they got the thing turned off it was after 9 in the morning. It 
took me all of 10 minutes to shut the water off and I don't work for the city," 
said Schur, 42, a private investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Boyd Roberts said he heard the commotion Sunday morning, stuck his 
head out his second story window and saw his two cars -- a Porsche and a Honda 
-- in a foot of water. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Porsche actually got about two inches of water inside the car, but at 
least it's running," said Roberts, 35, a commodities broker. "The Honda won't 
start." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Polley, who has lived in his home at 4204 River Ave. since 1958, said 
the water was a half-inch from rushing into the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had tidal problems many times before. It's caused us to extend our 
seawall three feet," said Polley, whose home backs up along the channel. "Two 
homes have been built in the past 10 years near the spot where the break 
occurred. Maybe they overburdened the line."

FATHER ACCUSED OF SHAKING, CRITICALLY HURTING BABY; CRIME: HE FACES FELONY 
CHILD ABUSE COUNT. HIS BRAIN-DAMAGED 6-WEEK-OLD SON IS NOT EXPECTED TO LIVE. 
</P>

<P>
 A 6-week-old boy clung to life Sunday in a hospital intensive care ward and 
was not expected to survive after being shaken so severely by his father that 
he suffered brain damage, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-year-old father, a Buena Park resident whom police would not identify, 
was arrested Saturday on suspicion of felony child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this child dies, that could change to manslaughter or murder," said Sgt. 
Jeff Kingsbury of the Buena Park Police Department. "The infant is on life 
support and extremely critical." 
</P>
<P>
 Kingsbury said the family called the Fire Department about 4:20 p.m. Saturday 
and said they thought the boy was "experiencing seizures." The baby was taken 
to La Palma Intercommunity Hospital, where doctors determined the injuries were 
life-threatening and had him transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit 
of Children's Hospital of Orange County, Kingsbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 "After being examined by doctors there it was determined that the baby had 
been violently shaken, causing brain damage," Kingsbury said.  
</P>
<P>
 The matter was turned over to the county Social Services Agency's child 
protective services, which made a preliminary investigation and contacted the 
Buena Park police, Kingsbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They described it as 'shaken baby syndrome,' " Kingsbury said. "Most of the 
time it happens when babies are crying. I guess out of frustration, someone 
will shake the baby to attempt to quiet it down and the head bounces back and 
forth and causes brain damage." 
</P>
<P>
 Kingsbury said "with this infant, they suspect severe damage." 
</P>
<P>
 Police refused to identify the child, its father or mother because of the 
ongoing investigation into the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Revealing the parents' identities "could affect our investigation," Lt. Mike 
Schwartz said. "There are other people to contact in this case and we don't 
want them tainted." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz did say the baby's parents were renting a room in a single-family 
home in Buena Park and that the mother was present when the incident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Curreri, a public health nurse with Orange County for 30 years and the 
mayor of Dana Point, said it is easy to hurt a young baby by shaking it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Curreri was unfamiliar with this case, she said child abuse is 
usually unintended and often comes in homes where a baby's crying can lead to 
the eviction of tenants who are renting a room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't speak to this case but, in general, the strength of an adult compared 
to a child's body is incredible," Curreri said. "A child's bones are so soft 
and it doesn't have much muscle in its neck. It doesn't take a lot to cause 
damage."

CHANGING OF THE GUARD COMES TO ANAHEIM CITY COUNCIL; GOVERNMENT: THREE VETERANS 
ARE LEAVING. NEW PANEL FACES POSSIBLE LOSS OF RAMS AS WELL AS DECISIONS ON 
STADIUM, DISNEY DEVELOPMENT.

 The most dramatic revamping of the City Council in 70 years is about to take 
place as 12-year incumbent Irv Pickler, former Mayor Fred Hunter, and former 
city manager Bob D. Simpson attend their final council meeting as members 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will have a largely inexperienced council when new members Lou Lopez 
and Bob Zemel are sworn in later this month. A fifth member will then have to 
be appointed by the council or chosen in a special election. When the new 
council is sworn, Mayor Tom Daly, elected in 1988, will be its most experienced 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 The new council takes over from a development-minded panel whose members 
bickered publicly and waged bitter political battles against each other. 
Nevertheless, the board still got things done. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a ton of experience leaving," said Hunter, who for four years was 
the city's colorful and controversial mayor. "During the years that we were 
there, we got the Anaheim Arena built, got downtown redevelopment rolling and 
there are a lot of other good things happening like Disney development." 
</P>
<P>
 For Hunter, 52, the end of his second four-year term appears to come as a 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who needs it?" he said in a recent interview. "There's more to life." 
</P>
<P>
 This is quite a reversal for a man who once talked about running for former 
Rep. William A. Dannemeyer's congressional seat and at one time was the only 
Orange County official to have his own weekly television and radio programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the charismatic Hunter has kept a relatively low profile since 1992 when 
he was ousted in a bitter election from the mayor's seat by Daly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Fred lost heart after the election," Pickler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter, who became a lawyer in 1975 after working for 10 years as an Anaheim 
police officer, has most recently devoted his energy largely to his downtown 
Anaheim law practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to become one of the best trial lawyers in Orange County," he said 
during a brief interview last week, in which he also briefly discussed his 
years in office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met a lot of good people like (California Angels owner) Gene Autry, (Rams 
President) John Shaw and (Walt Disney Co. Chairman) Michael Eisner," he said. 
"And I liked working with the people in the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter counts as his greatest accomplishment on the council the building of 
the Anaheim Arena, a project he championed though it was considered a bold 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the facility is a big success, Hunter attributed his loss in the 1992 
mayoral election to his ardent support of the arena, which at the time showed 
little promise of attracting professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a case of bad timing for Hunter; just a month after the election, the 
Walt Disney Co. announced it would bring a National Hockey League franchise to 
Orange County -- a bittersweet moment for Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 The former mayor said he is also proud of his efforts on behalf of city 
employees and points to the abolishment of a two-tier pay scale for 
firefighters as another key accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a street cop for 10 years and I was a street mayor," he said. "I think 
I made working conditions better for the employees of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Today though -- after eight years in office including three campaigns for 
mayor -- Hunter has a distaste for politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politics has turned dirty," he said. "That's the part that's downright 
terrible. It's just not worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, too, sounds eager to leave the political arena after four years on 
the council, three years as Anaheim's city manager and six years as its fire 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, who is 64, decided against running for a second council term or 
challenging Daly in this year's mayoral race, which Daly won handily over 
Curtis Stricker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's time for some new blood," Simpson said. "The thought of running 
for office again was, quite frankly, revolting." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, who worked for the Los Angeles Fire Department for 25 years before 
coming to Anaheim in 1980, will continue his part-time job as head of the 
Anaheim Area Hotel-Motel Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's enough to keep me out of mischief but beyond that, I have no immediate 
plans to be actively involved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson said that the highlight of his years on the council was the 
opportunity to vote on projects that he had a part in creating as city manager, 
a job he retired from in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the rare privilege of being involved in the first negotiations for 
Westcot," Simpson said. "At that time, it didn't even have a name. We brought 
this thing along very gradually." 
</P>
<P>
 The Walt Disney Co.'s ambitious expansion project would include 1,800 new 
hotel rooms, a shopping district and a second theme park called Westcot. The 
project is already two years behind its original schedule and Disney officials 
said this month that they are considering scaling back the proposal because it 
appears too costly. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (Westcot) comes to fruition, and I believe it will, it will rank as the 
single greatest accomplishment to come to Anaheim since Disneyland because it's 
an economic engine that our city needs," Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson said he saw himself as a "stabilizing" influence on a council that 
generally voted together but was sometimes plagued by infighting or entrenched 
differences on such issues as a utility tax, card clubs and privatization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am extremely proud to have been a part of it all," he said. "I'm proudest 
of the things relating to people and the friendships because those are the 
things that warm your heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Alone among his colleagues, Pickler, 72, is leaving office reluctantly. If not 
for a term-limit law passed by voters in 1992, Pickler said he probably would 
have sought a fourth term. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm young at heart and my mind is working," he said during an interview in 
his office at City Hall, where empty cardboard boxes were stacked, soon to be 
filled with the proclamations, awards, photos and other memorabilia of his 
three council terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickler was surprisingly upbeat last week, despite having just lost the 
campaign for the 68th District Assembly seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "You win one, great. You lose one, great. You can't dwell on it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickler took heat from his colleagues for his opposition to the Anaheim Arena 
but said he is happy that the facility has been a success. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to spend more money on police and fire and on fixing streets," he 
said. "I was opposed to the dollars-and-cents aspect, but it was a good project 
and we can hold our heads high." 
</P>
<P>
 Pickler said he would like to see the city attract a National Basketball Assn. 
team to the arena, which would boost the arena's financial base. 
</P>
<P>
 The new council will also face the immediate prospect of the Rams leaving 
Anaheim, and must decide whether to renovate Anaheim Stadium as a football-only 
facility or build a new stadium for the California Angels, or both. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Pickler would like to see the new council restore some of the service 
programs cut in recent years. "When things get tight, we always take away from 
parks and recreation and libraries and things I think are important," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With his council term nearly over, Pickler, a retired printer, finds that all 
of a sudden he has time on his hands. He hopes to stay involved with some of 
the numerous county boards and commissions he has been appointed to. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best part has been getting involved," he said. "It's been a real 
education for Irv Pickler. I've learned so much and I've enjoyed it. I have no 
regrets."

HONORING FIGHTERS FOR FAITH; VIETNAMESE MARTYRS COMMEMORATED AT MASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA NGUYEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Squinting into the bright sun, Huy Thi Vu hid tears as shereceived Communion 
at a special outdoor Mass on Sunday at Santa Ana Stadium to honor 117 
Vietnamese Catholic martyrs. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Vu, more than 5,000 Vietnamese Roman Catholics gathered as part of 
an annual celebration of the martyrs, slain in their homeland from the 16th to 
19th centuries. All were proclaimed saints in 1988 by Pope John Paul II in the 
largest group canonization in church history. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the annual commemoration represents one of the most significant 
events for this ethnic Catholic community. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big event for the Vietnamese people because it reminds us of the 
struggles our ancestors went through to fight for our faith," said Pho Van 
Pham, president of the Vietnamese Catholic Community of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mass began as a line of youths carried a gold-trimmed shrine and flowers 
onto the stage while the crowd joined the choir in singing Vietnamese hymns. 
During the ceremony, 18 red-robed Vietnamese priests sat with Bishop Norman F. 
McFarland, who in his sermon lauded the Vietnamese Catholic community and its 
growing solidarity with the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Vietnamese people have suffered mightily," McFarland said in an interview 
before theMass. "As they say, the blood of the martyr is the sea of the 
church." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those declared saints by Pope John Paul II six years ago for their 
martyrdom in Vietnam were both Asians and Europeans, priests and lay people, 
said Msgr. Peter Tien of the Diocese of Orange. Since the late 16th Century, 
when Christianity arrived in the then-Southeast Asian colony of Imperial China, 
130,000 have been persecuted for refusing to denounce the Catholic faith, he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The most famous of the 117 is Ba Thanh De, the only female Vietnamese saint. 
</P>
<P>
 A housekeeper and mother of six, De hid priests from the Mandarin emperor. 
When the priests were found and arrested, authorities threatened De and asked 
her to renounce her faith. 
</P>
<P>
 She refused, was jailed for three years and died in prison at age 63. 
</P>
<P>
 Stories such as De's serve as role models for Vietnamese children, said youth 
leader Thong Quoc Vu, helping them to learn and embrace their cultural 
heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many kids come here and their self-esteem is low when they don't have anyone 
to look up to. But at church they learn about their ancestors, the Vietnamese 
language and can relate to their own heroes," said Vu, 24, whose church in Lake 
Forest is named after another famous martyr, Thanh Le Bao Tinh. 
</P>
<P>
 The church's recognition of Vietnamese people and their history bolsters pride 
in the Vietnamese community, Tien said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 350 children from various Catholic youth groups attended the Mass, 
joining in the service, which was led by McFarland. During the ceremony, women 
danced to traditional music while clothed in red and golden ao dais, Vietnamese 
dresses worn over flowing pants. 
</P>
<P>
 Dureen Truong, 10, was among hundreds of children who came with their parents. 
"I was excited to come," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the two-hour service ended, some celebrants and attendees wiped away 
tears as they exited the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 A contained Nguyet Bui said, "It can be very emotional and painful to 
reminisce on how the saints sacrificed their lives to save our religious 
freedom."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; GARDEN GROVE, STANTON CHOSEN FOR HOME REPAIR 
PROJECT

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County chapter of a national organization that helps repair the 
homes of low-income families, disabled people and the elderly has chosen Garden 
Grove as one of two sites for its volunteer efforts this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Christmas in April" organizes one-day blitzes to repair and rehabilitate the 
homes of people who have problems maintaining their residences, either for lack 
of money or because of disability. 
</P>
<P>
 This year the organization has targeted 12 homes and three shelters in Garden 
Grove and Stanton. The work will be done the last Saturday of April, but homes 
that need more extensive repairs may be started in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Garden Grove City Council endorsed the organization's efforts 
and directed city code enforcers to help identify homeowners who need help.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FULLERTON; YOUNGSTERS GET BIG KICK OUT OF CLASS

<P>
 Two steps up. Five steps back. Mie-guere (front kick). Oi-zuki (sharp air 
jab). 
</P>
<P>
 Sensei Mario Huipe's karate classes are full of such instructions, which his 
students follow with fervor. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen of the city's neediest children attend Huipe's free classes on 
weekends at the First Baptist Church. Huipe, a Karate Do brown belt, has been 
offering the classes for the past two years to youngsters who cannot afford 
private lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 Huipe, whose heritage is of the Purepecha Indian tribe from Michoacan, Mexico, 
conducts his classes in Japanese, English and Spanish. Most of his pupils speak 
English and Spanish and are enthusiastically picking up some Japanese along 
with karate technique. But that's not all they're learning in this 
gang-alternative program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Karate makes me feel like I can do anything," said student Julian Gomez, 13. 
"I'm learning how to protect myself, how to say no to gangs and drugs and be 
proud of myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight-year-old Luis Montes, who recently won two first-place trophies at a 
National Junior Karate Tournament, credits Huipe for his success in the sport 
and in school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to get bad grades," said Luis, who started taking Huipe's class 1 1/2 
years ago. "Now I get all A's. It's because of the karate. . . . I feel like I 
can be a champion in everything." 
</P>
<P>
 His parents agreed, saying they are grateful for Huipe's classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Huipe "motivates the children to excel in everything," Luis' father, Angel 
Montes, said. Stimulating the whole child through the mental and physical 
rigors of karate is the purpose for the classes, said Huipe, who works as a 
security guard for the Shield Security Co., based in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something very amazing happens through the martial arts," he said. "The 
students gain self-confidence, self-esteem and a feeling that they can take on 
any challenge. That kind of pride helps you later in life. You can face 
difficult situations in a calm manner and make the right decisions. MIMI KO

<P>
 A request to add a major retail store to the Mission Viejo Freeway Center will 
be heard by the Planning Commission tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mission Viejo Co. is proposing to eliminate plans for a restaurant in the 
outdoor shopping center and add a 35,000-square-foot building that would be 
occupied by REI Inc., an outdoor goods supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Sunnie Castner said the proposal needed to be studied in more 
detail at the meeting, but added that "it sounds like a good concept. I don't 
have any major problems with . . . doing away with the restaurant for more 
retail space." 
</P>
<P>
 A planning consultant representing the Mission Viejo Co. said the building, 
which would be in the southern portion of the shopping center, would be sited 
where two smaller structures were planned. FRANK MESSINA

CENTERS

<P>
 The City Council has hit a snag in finding organizations willing to operate 
and take financial control of the city's four recreation centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Failing so far to find interested parties, the council this week approved an 
18-month contract extension for Sports Leisure Group, which runs two of the 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
 With recreation-oriented groups such as the YMCA and Boy Scouts of America 
showing little enthusiasm in the remaining two centers, the council also 
authorized lease proposals to be sent to any other interested parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will basically just buy us some time," City Councilwoman Sharon Cody 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the council agreed to lease the largest recreation center, on 
Marguerite Parkway, to the YMCA. The smallest facility, the Sierra Recreation 
Center, was closed earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had sold about 2,200 memberships in the recreation centers, serving 
about 5,000 residents. Fees average about $40 per month, with no initiation 
costs. The four recreation centers contain facilities for swimming, tennis, 
basketball and weight lifting. 
</P>
<P>
 With only two of the four centers left under city control, city officials 
acknowledged that membership rates probably will be lowered to perhaps $20 per 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with annual revenue shortfalls of up to $1 million for running the 
centers, the council decided earlier this year to lease the facilities. FRANK

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ORANGE; PRINCIPAL NAVIGATES TOWARD CHARTER SCHOOL'S 1ST 
TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santiago Middle School Principal Mary Ann Owsley must resolve a host of 
weighty issues before she opens the county's first charter school next fall, 
but she is finding that the simplest issues can be the most controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 Students took three ballots before they agreed on colors for the mandatory 
school uniform, and Owsley said she anticipates a few struggles before everyone 
agrees to wear the white, gray or teal shirt with navy pants, skirts or shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 With that detail decided, school officials are putting final touches on the 
one-page contract that students will have to sign before they can attend 
Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
 The school became the state's 66th charter school in July under a concept that 
frees it from state and local control and gives administrators power over their 
own budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Owsley said she will meet with each of the school's 870 students and their 
parents between March and June to discuss the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agreement is really innocuous in that it just outlines the concepts of 
the charter," Owsley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers will sign the contract as well and commit themselves to giving 
students a quality education in a safe environment. Parents must agree to 
involve themselves in their children's education and volunteer at least 12 
hours a year to the school.  
</P>
<P>
 Details are being hammered out in monthly Parent Advisory Committee 
discussions. The next meeting will be at 7 p.m. Nov. 30, in the school's 
library, at 515 N. Rancho Santiago Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want people to come in here with their eyes wide open," Owsley said. "We 
have to make sure our intentions are very, very clear." LESLEY WRIGHT

 For 15 years, Grace Winchell has been a driving force in the decision-making 
process of her city.  
</P>
<P>
 But now, Winchell is bowing out of local politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Winchell, who has served on the City Council the past eight years, will step 
down as a member of the council at today's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Winchell, 57, has already served two four-year terms and because of term 
limits was not eligible to run again for office in the recent municipal 
election.  
</P>
<P>
 The four people who were elected to serve on the seven-member council will be 
sworn in and take office at the Dec. 5 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Winchell, a 25-year resident who was appointed to the Planning Commission in 
1979, said stepping down is "certainly going to leave a hole" in her life, 
which includes parenting three children and working as an administrator at Cal 
State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 During Winchell's tenure on the council, the new city pier was built, the 
Central Library was expanded, a Cultural Arts Center was planned and a citywide 
recycling program was started. 
</P>
<P>
 Winchell also helped spur revision of the development plan for downtown so 
that it encompassed lower density and a village-type atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Winchell praised the makeup of the new council.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a citizens-oriented council," she said "It's kind of an 
indication that the people who live in Huntington Beach and raise families here 
are now the driving forces in the community, as opposed to the old guard that 
was really more large developer-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel really good retiring from this council and leaving it in the hands of 
wonderful people." DEBRA CANO

<P>
 The City Council has picked Dec. 17 as this year's date for the city's annual 
Santa Claus Parade. 
</P>
<P>
 The yearly event is something like trick-or-treat and Mardi Gras wrapped in a 
Christmas theme.One of the annual event's highlights occurs when Santa and the 
five council members ride through town on a county fire engine. 
</P>
<P>
 The daylong ride through town starts about 8 a.m. and continues to about 5 
p.m. The fire engine goes down residential streets, and council members pass 
out candy to children. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the colorful event is marred by rain. But by mayoral proclamation, 
it was announced recently that weather would be good Dec. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will not rain this year," Mayor Barry Denes jokingly proclaimed. "It 
rained last year." BILL BILLITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Adding youth recreational facilities to the southwest area will be among the 
discussion topics when the City Council meets at 7 tonight. . 
</P>
<P>
 At the suggestion of Councilman Jim Potts, the council will consider creating 
facilities, such as a youth center or a roller hockey rink. Possible locations 
for these youth programs include properties at the northeast corner of Newport 
and Sycamore avenues, and the northwest corner of Tustin Village Way and 
McFadden Avenue. 
</P>

possibility of performing services for the city on a contract basis. The city 
has contracted legal services for the past three decades from Rourke, Woodruff 
& Spradlin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been 30 years," Potts said at the Nov. 7 council meeting. "I just think 
we need to see what's out there."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; SMOKING BAN DELAY AIDS SCHOOL BINGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bingo players will still be able to smoke at twice-weekly bingo games at a 
local middle school, but they'll have to step outside to light up. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Unified School District board has agreed to wait until a July 1 
deadline to comply with a state-required smoking ban on all school property.The 
smoking ban is required whether or not students are on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay gives high school music boosters seven more months to raise money 
from local bingo games. Peggy Stalter, vice president of the Irvine High School 
Instrumental Music Boosters, says a survey of bingo players indicates most will 
not attend the games after the total smoking ban goes into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Bingo raises about $60,000 a year for instrumental music programs at the 
district's three high schools. But boosters say the cost of leasing an 
off-campus location is too high. And nonprofit organizations are reluctant to 
allow smoking in their buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school district is still looking for a fairy godperson to help us out," 
school board member Mary Ellen Hadley said. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal law, which goes into effect Dec. 26, will ban smoking inside 
buildings used by all public schools, public libraries and child-care providers 
that receive federal funds. But tougher state legislation that goes into effect 
July 1 will require public school districts and county government offices to 
enforce a nonsmoking policy on all property. 
</P>
<P>
 High school music boosters asked the school board to pass a resolution in 
support of amending the anti-smoking legislation, but the trustees declined. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pledged to be a no-smoking district," Hadley said, "but unfortunately 
it pits two important things against each other." RUSS LOAR LAWS

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; MASSAGE ORDINANCE MAY BE AMENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a revised ordinance governing massage 
businesses, but the law is likely to change almost as soon as it takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Therapeutic massage professionals -- who do sports medicine and psychotherapy 
based massage -- requested an exemption from portions of the ordinance, which 
is designed to curtail prostitution and other illegal activities that are often 
fronted by massage parlors. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure received unanimous approval at last week's council meeting. 
Councilman John Cox was absent. The council, however, told staff to return in a 
month -- to a substantially different council -- with an exemption for the 
professional therapists. 
</P>
<P>
 Although professional therapists are classified as "holistic health 
professionals," the ordinance still subjects them to the same background checks 
and other tests as massage technicians, who generally have less training and 
are not engaged in massage related to sports medicine or psychotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want these people that are in a perfectly legitimate business to have 
to go through all this fingerprinting and venereal disease testing because that 
is degrading not only to them but to the city," outgoing Councilman Phil 
Sansone said. 
</P>
<P>
 He recommended putting an exemption into the ordinance that was before the 
council but backed off when Revenue Manager Glen Everroad and Police Capt. Jim 
Jacobs said they had not had time to look into the suggested tests 
professionals would have to pass to get the exemption. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Norton, president of the Orange County chapter of the American Massage 
Therapists Assn., said that the national group's test is too rigorous for 
impostors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department will spend $39,342 a year -- funded from the permit fees 
collected -- to pay a new community services officer to administer the 
ordinance. HOLLY J. WAGNER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY SELECTED TO HOST WILDLIFE 
CONFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has been selected to host the fifth annual National Watchable 
Wildlife Conference in November, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 600 people are expected to attend the conference, said Diane Baker, 
president of Huntington Beach Conference and Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker said holding the conference here is significant because it will focus on 
Orange County's environmental attractions and create an awareness of the 
county's natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to make this part of California a focus of ecotourism," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach, for instance, has almost 300 species of birds that come to 
town during the winter, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "People come from all over the world to see those birds," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Baker said, the conference will be at a time when business is at its 
lowest.  
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a shot in the arm business-wise for Huntington Beach," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city won bidding to hold the conference through a team effort including 
Baker; Bob Garrison, a state Department of Fish and Game official; Jeanne 
Clark, a wildlife author; Peter Green, board chairman of the Conference and 
Visitors Bureau and newly elected councilman, and Phil Smith, director of Bolsa 
Chica Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waterfront Hilton Beach Resort has been selected as the hotel headquarters 
and meeting site. Other properties within the city also will be used, Baker 
said. DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; CITY, CHAMBER PLAN COMMUNITY EVENT

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has agreed to join the Los Alamitos Area Chamber of Commerce 
in sponsoring a community event to showcase local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 A health fair and scholarship pageant will be held simultaneously with the 
unnamed community event, tentatively scheduled for June 10. 
</P>
<P>
 In a unanimous vote last week, the council agreed to donate two scholarships 
of $500 each for winners of the pageant, the details of which have yet to be 
worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the council agreed to waive fees for the use of Laurel Park, 
where the event will be staged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someday this could be big for the community," said George Briggeman Jr., 
chamber president. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the city to be our partner in this project," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Briggeman said that local restaurants will operate food booths, and the Los 
Alamitos Medical Center will sponsor a health fair at which residents may get 
free dental and health checkups. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the events will be family-oriented, council members rejected the 
chamber's proposal that beer sales be allowed at the fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Students in Los Alamitos will choose the name and design the logo for the 
event in a contest that will be launched soon, Briggeman said. BERT ELJERA

PROTESTERS OPPOSE SUPER KMART OPENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 200 protesters rallied Sunday against the grand opening of a Super Kmart 
Center in La Habra, decrying the creation of a giant new retail center they say 
will force small store owners out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest is expected to be repeated Wednesday in Anaheim Hills, where 
another Super Kmart will open, said Rick Eiden, director of organizing for a 
branch of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Eiden said the protesters, who included labor officials, teachers, 
small-business owners and community leaders, are troubled by Kmart's hiring of 
non-union workers, who are paid far less in wages and health benefits than 
union workers employed by other businesses.  
</P>
<P>
 Those opposed to the Kmart in La Habra also are upset that the city gave the 
retailer a $3 million break on property offered by the city as an incentive to 
locate in La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would a community do this?" Eiden asked. "The small-business owners -- 
the hardware store owner and the bookstore owner -- will be put out of business 
because of retail stores like Kmart." 
</P>
<P>
 Company employees at the La Habra store declined comment Sunday but Kmart 
officials have said in the past that the store will employ 250 full-time and 
600 part-time employees and generate $35 million a year in sales tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials aggressively courted the Super Kmart Center and have offered no 
apologies for the incentives offered to the company.

CITY TO AID IN MAKING BUILDINGS QUAKE SAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has tentatively approved an ordinance requiring owners of 
older buildings considered likely to collapse during a significant earthquake 
to make those structures safer. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the council last week offered to pay half the cost of new 
designs and waive some city fees for owners who fix their properties. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent survey indicated that 12 buildings on Main Street, between Garden 
Grove Boulevard and Acacia Parkway, were built with unreinforced masonry and 
could be dangerous during an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Development Director Matthew Fertal said such buildings have become 
a concern across the state following recent earthquakes, particularly the 
Northridge earthquake that damaged hundreds of buildings in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, patterned after a state model, requires owners to strengthen 
their properties within a certain period of time, which could be extended if 
specific improvements are done right away. 
</P>
<P>
 To help the owners comply, the city will pay up to $5,000 for plans and 
designs. In addition, the Planning Department will not charge building permit 
and plan check fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Fertal said in a report to the council that before the city extends help, each 
building owner must obtain bids for the plans from licensed engineers or 
architects. 
</P>
<P>
 Fertal said that the program will be paid through Community Development Block 
grants. BERT ELJERA

ARCHIVES OFFICE, CLOSED DOWN BY FLOOD, TO REOPEN TUESDAY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Archives office in the Chet Holifield Federal Building will 
reopen to the public Tuesday, slightly more than a week after a burst pipe sent 
water flooding through the office. 
</P>
<P>
 National Archives regional director Diane Nixon said water began pouring out 
of a research room drinking fountain sometime over the Veterans' Day three-day 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 No research materials were damaged because most are stored in boxes at least 
three inches off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all valuable records dealing with the history of this region since 
1851, so those are irreplaceable," Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said between 80 and 100 people use the department's records each day to 
trace family trees and study local history. It took a week to repair the damage 
because carpets and walls had to be dried before the office could be reopened.

DEAD BABY'S FATHER MAINTAINS INNOCENCE; INVESTIGATION: HELD ON SUSPICION OF 
MURDER AFTER 8-MONTH-OLD DAUGHTER'S DEATH, HE SAYS SHE ACCIDENTALLY SUFFOCATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A print shop worker from Santa Ana who was arrested on suspicion of killing 
his infant daughter vowed from jail Sunday -- amid sobs and moans -- that he is 
innocent and that his baby died in a tragic accident.  
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Perez, 34, wearing a green jail shirt and pants, talked breathlessly 
from behind thick glass at the Santa Ana Detention Facility. "I have nothing to 
lie about," Perez said in Spanish. "Who feels more pain about my dear baby's 
death -- me or the police? I'm already suffering because she died, and now they 
are accusing me of killing her." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana police went to a house in the 600 block of Borchard Street on Friday 
afternoon after receiving a 911 call from the home. The caller reported that a 
baby had stopped breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 Child abuse investigators were called when 8-month-old Kenya Perez was dead on 
arrival at a hospital, and officers arrested Jorge Perez shortly afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities refused Sunday to disclose what evidence they found to implicate 
Perez. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said in the jail interview that he took a nap with Kenya at his side 
about 2:15 p.m. Friday. When he woke up at about 3:15 p.m., he said, Kenya had 
vanished. He said that when he got out of bed to see if a housemate had picked 
up the infant, he saw her body plunged headfirst into an empty hamper near the 
bed.  
</P>
<P>
 He said she probably woke up while he slept, crawled over the sheets, fell 
into the hamper and suffocated.  
</P>
<P>
 "If only there had been clothes inside, maybe she wouldn't have died," Perez 
said tearfully. "I failed my wife. I was supposed to take care of my baby, and 
I failed. I failed her."  
</P>
<P>
 Police said they arrested Perez because he gave inconsistent accounts of what 
happened to the baby, but officers refused to give details. Coroner's 
investigators have completed an autopsy on the baby, but neither coroner's 
officials nor police released results. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez's housemate, Joe Ortuno, said the Perez family had been renting a room 
in the house for about 2 1/2 months.  
</P>
<P>
 Perez said he and his wife, Clarissa Perez, immigrated to California from 
Mexico City with their first daughter, Marybelle, in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that during the last four years he has worked night shifts copying 
advertising circulars at Handbill Printers in Garden Grove, usually from 10 
p.m. to 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, he said, he dropped off Clarissa Perez at the print shop, where she 
also worked, for her shift beginning at 1 p.m. Usually he took Kenya to be 
watched by a relative before picking up 8-year-old Marybelle at school, he 
said, but he decided to keep Kenya at home that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said he dozed off for a quick rest because he had not slept well in 
three days. The baby was calm and had not been crying, he said. "I was sleeping 
so soundly, I didn't hear her," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 He said that after he saw her in the hamper, he tried to administer 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Then he tried to summon the boyfriend of 
Ortuno's mother, who was asleep in another room. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ortuno ran to look at the baby, she was lying on the bed and her lips 
were blue. He then called 911. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez was frustrated that he had not been able to speak to his family by 
telephone since his arrest, and maintained his innocence. "I keep telling them 
what happened," Perez said. "Why won't they believe me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Perez is being held at the Santa Ana Detention Facility on suspicion of 
murder. Bail was set at $250,000.

Q & A: THRIFT CHIEF LOOKS TO '95; WORRIED BY LATEST FED HIKE, AMERICAN SAVINGS 
OFFICIAL SEES DIP IN RATE NEXT YEAR

<P>
 Last week's interest rate hike has some business leaders scratching their 
heads wondering whether the Federal Reserve Board's action is going to send the 
country into another economic tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed raised the rate it charges banks by three-quarters of a percentage 
point -- what bankers call 75 basis points -- and the increase is rippling 
right through to the real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, that market can hardly afford another hit, says Robert T. 
Barnum, president of American Savings Bank in Irvine, Orange County's largest 
thrift and the fourth-largest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnum doesn't think the latest hike -- the sixth this year -- will affect the 
already low demand in California for home loans. 
</P>
<P>
 American Savings, which targets low- and moderate-income areas, is continuing 
to grow, he said. Unlike fixed-rate mortgages, the adjustable-rate mortgages 
(known as ARMs) it offers typically carry lower interest rates, which rise as a 
result of each Fed increase. And thrifts generally use the 11th District Cost 
of Funds Index (COFI), which has been the slowest-moving interest rate index. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see people not buying," he said. "If they now have a job and they've 
really been postponing buying a house for four years, I don't think this rate 
hike is going to dampen their decision to purchase a home." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Barnum is worried that the Fed has gone too far and is 
jeopardizing the nation's recovery and, worse, California's fragile climb out 
of its worst recession in decades. In an interview, he discussed his concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: With the Fed's latest rate hike, there's a bigger gap -- nearly 
three percentage points -- between fixed-rate mortgage loans and 
adjustable-rate mortgages. How long will that kind of gap last? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Not long. I think rates are going to come down next year. I don't see 
any reason that they're as high as they are now. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How much will they fall? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'll tell you my favorite quote in life: "There's a high correlation 
between people who think they know what's happening to interest rates and 
people with low net worth." I use that (laughing) to guide my principles in 
business. But I think 100 basis points (1 percentage point) ought to be about 
right. That's where the mark ought to be now. I think it's 100 basis points too 
high now, so I think it's got to come down. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will that happen by March or April? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think by the middle of the year. I just hope it comes and doesn't get 
choked off. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How precarious do you think is the economy in Orange County and Southern 
California with the Fed's big hike in interest rates? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think we have put the California recovery at risk. There's now a 
reasonable chance of us falling back into recession. That's why I think rates 
are going to fall. I think the Fed is going to figure this out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there any effort by business leaders to get through to the Fed, Congress 
or others in Washington? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The Business Roundtable and people like that have been talking to the 
government and saying, "Wall Street may want this and Wall Street may be 
worrying about the dollar and Wall Street may be worrying about foreign 
investments pulling out of Treasury bills, but let me tell you about America. 
Let me tell you what I'm seeing in my plant. Let me tell you what I'm seeing 
about wage pressure. I don't know what you guys are looking at, but it isn't 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Would it be safe to say that early this year, you were optimistic about 
Orange County recovering from the recession? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, I really was. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How about now? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Now I'm worried. Orange County's going to recover two years after the rest 
of the United States recovers. I was feeling pretty comfortable that the U.S. 
economy was doing really well and that Orange County was going to lag and 
recover with it. Now I'm worried. I really do believe interest rates are going 
to come down and this will all be kind of an exercise everybody's gone through. 
But I'm worried that the interest rates could choke off the U.S. recovery, 
which I didn't think was possible six months ago. And if we choke off the U.S. 
recovery, we'll choke off Orange County and we'll be back in the recession 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Housing starts, home sales and other indicators fell last month here and 
across the nation, in some cases more than the normal seasonal decline. What's 
happening? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I was just at a meeting nearby where this guy from Chicago was saying, 
"Gee, this bull real estate market we've had for the last three years . . ." 
and this all-California audience was looking at him like, "Where are you coming 
from?" The rest of the nation has had a hot real estate market fueled a lot by 
low interest rates. But no home loan market can be sustained simply by low 
interest rates. People have to have confidence that they're going to have a 
job. If they have confidence that they're going to have a job or their income 
will grow, they will go out and buy cars and houses. The Midwest has had that. 
California has not had that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you see local consumer confidence changing at all? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I see it getting very, very slightly better in California. But (with the 
latest interest rate increase) it's hard for us here to figure out, 'What's the 
Fed worried about here? Excess capacity all over the place? Wage pressure?' 
You've got to be kidding me. I see people in California feeling a little better 
about their jobs. But buying a house, particularly buying a house in October, 
November? I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does news of rate increases hurt consumer confidence in a recovering 
economy? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I may have a different view of life sitting here in Irvine looking at the 
world. But I don't know what the Fed's looking at. I mean, inflation? Where is 
it? It's not in oil. It's not in raw materials. It's not in wages. Different 
economic factors are driving the Fed to raise rates, and, boy, I tell you, 
sitting right here, I don't know any business that's worrying about runaway 
demand for their products. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think the Fed is relying on outdated methods to measure how fast the 
economy is growing? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Right. And what scares me is that they could choke off the recovery when 
the recovery really has barely started, particularly in Southern California, 
but also in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So how are last week's rate increases going to shake out in the mortgage 
market? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think on the home purchase side, it's not going to have a lot of impact. 
Plus, a lot of people sit there and say, "Oh my God. They're going to increase 
rates again, so I'd better go out and hurry up and do something." Refinancings 
already have been hit with a knockout punch, and they won't be affected further 
because a lot of people who have home equity loans tied to the prime rate are 
getting clobbered on their second mortgages. So they'll want to refinance to 
pay off that debt. The home equity market itself will dry up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: With rising rates, borrowers have been turning to adjustable-rate 
mortgages. How big has that shift been? 
</P>
<P>
 A: From 1992 to the first part of this year, the market was 70% fixed, 30% 
ARM. Now it's 35% fixed, 65% ARM. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Borrowers also need to make more money to afford the same kind of homes 
they could have bought two months ago or a year ago. How is that impacting 
loans in minority and poorer areas? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's going to be a problem for fixed-rate lenders. But it's a great 
opportunity for us because with our ARMs -- based on the 11th District Cost of 
Funds Index -- are still 6.3% and fixed rates are 9.15%. So when you talk about 
affordability, you talk about people looking and saying, "Can I afford this 
monthly payment?" It's really causing, for the first time in five years, people 
to ask again what COFI (Cost of Funds Index) means and what the other terms in 
ARMs mean. And for us, particularly in the low- and moderate-income areas, it's 
really made a powerful statement about the difference between an ARM and a 
fixed-rate loan. We haven't had this big a percentage-point difference in eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Housing starts had been picking up in Orange County. Will this rate hike 
stifle that market for awhile? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yeah, I think it will. Builders still are having a hard time getting 
financing, and they have had to come up with a lot more equity. So their cost 
of carrying land is going up. I still think there's a lot of demand for new 
2,000-square-foot, $180,000 houses in Southern California. But builders now 
have to worry about their costs, so they're going to hold down production. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Though you don't make business loans, you keep abreast of what that segment 
is doing. How is it doing? 
</P>
<P>
 A: What I look at are commercial vacancy rates, which are going down. And that 
means white-collar business is moving in. It's the small-business operators 
moving in. The big manufacturing companies -- the ASTs and the Hughes -- are 
still moving out, but it's the small service companies that seem to be moving 
in and causing commercial vacancy rates to go down. They're the ones keeping 
the employment going. That's why hope stays alive. I just worry that the 
interest rates are going to choke off the recovery.

ELECTIONS '94: IMPACT ON BUSINESS; KEY HOUSE PANEL TO BE OVERHAULED BY 
REPUBLICANS; CONGRESS: A SCALED-BACK ENERGY, COMMERCE COMMITTEE MAY SUIT 
BUSINESS BETTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When incoming Republican leaders met last week to fulfill an election pledge 
to slash House committees, the panel targeted for one of the biggest hits was 
one that has long been a thorn in the side of the GOP and its business allies: 
the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past 14 years, the committee has grown into a sprawling powerhouse 
under the chairmanship of Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich), a blustering former 
prosecutor who earned the nickname "The Truck" for being one of Congress' 
toughest investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 His 130-member committee staff has made a career of going after high and 
mighty business figures such as deposed junk bond king Michael R. Milken, 
assorted defense contractors and even Los Angeles-based First Executive Corp., 
whose president, Fred Carr, was questioned about the soundness of the insurance 
company's investments. 
</P>
<P>
 That era will end in January when Dingell's likely replacement -- Rep. Thomas 
J. Bliley Jr. (R-Va.), a self-described "genteel conservative" -- takes over as 
chairman. Although Bliley has declined to comment publicly on his agenda, 
pending his appointment, most observers expect the committee to be less 
regulatory and far friendlier to business. 
</P>
<P>
 "If ever there was a committee on Capitol Hill that made companies quake in 
their boots, it was the Energy and Commerce Committee," said Charles Lewis, 
executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a Washington-based 
research group on government ethics. "That committee, as much as any other 
committee on Capitol Hill, went after industry. I would think there are a lot 
of people who have come to detest John Dingell and his committee, and are 
celebrating right now." 
</P>
<P>
 For corporate America as well as American consumers, the pending change in 
leadership at the committee may be one of the most pivotal post-election events 
of the 1994 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Billions of dollars ride on the decisions of the committee, which oversees 
environmental regulation, securities markets, health care, telecommunications, 
railroads, consumer protection, tourism and even some trade issues. So 
extensive is the panel's reach that one committee aide joked that its 
jurisdiction is rumored to extend to "everything that moves, bleeds or burns." 
</P>
<P>
 It remains to be seen, however, whether corporate America will find 
deliverance in Bliley, a former Democrat who operated a funeral home before he 
successfully ran for mayor of Richmond, Va. Some issues taken up by the 
committee -- telecommunications, for example -- have historically been so 
nonpartisan that House bills to promote cable re-regulation and 
telecommunications competition have passed by overwhelming margins. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, if his fellow Republicans have their way, the committee Bliley 
takes over may only be a shadow of its former self. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because Republicans are considering a proposal to rename the committee 
the Health and Commerce Committee and slash its staff by half, to about 60. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources familiar with the Republican discussions say a task force is 
considering a proposal that would strip the committee of its current oversight 
of environmental issues, railroads, energy and some securities issues. The 
panel would continue to oversee telecommunications, health care, insurance and 
some business investment issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognize the fact that we should give up some of this jurisdiction and 
spread it around," said Rep. Dan Schaefer (R-Colo.), a member of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee. The committee, he added, has a huge jurisdiction: "Some 40% 
of all (congressional) legislation comes before the committee." 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer said the committee's size has created a regulatory excess epitomized 
by lawmakers like Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.), who chairs Energy and Commerce's 
subcommittee on health and environment and has been a big proponent of tougher 
anti-smoking laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "Henry Waxman, year after year, was pushing new regulation and thereby driving 
up costs in the health care arena," Schaefer said. "We're trying to avoid 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite talk of reining in the committee -- talk which must survive lengthy 
turf battles -- Bliley will, nevertheless, be a figure to be reckoned with. 
Already, as a result of his imminent appointment, the Virginian has achieved 
new prominence. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, the only calls we would get were from papers like the Richmond 
Times (Dispatch) or the Green County Record in Standardsville, Va. But the day 
after the elections, I came back to my office and had 47 calls from everybody, 
from the 'Today Show' to CBS News," said Bliley's press secretary, Charles 
Boesel. When asked about Bliley's last major TV appearance, Boesel mused, 
"Hmmmm, I don't know. It may have been 1987 on CNN." 
</P>
<P>
 Colleagues, staff members and lobbyists say Bliley is highly respected and has 
gotten along well even with his Democratic adversaries, especially Dingell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bliley is not an ideologue," said David Vienna, a Washington lobbyist for the 
Pacific Stock Exchange and other securities industry groups. "He's tended to 
work in a bipartisan way on the committee. He's a consensus builder . . . . I 
don't expect that to change." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the Republican landslide this month has imbued the GOP with a new 
swagger that's not likely to fade when Republicans make up the majority of both 
houses of Congress next year. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent speech before the Media Institute in Washington, Roy Neel, a 
former Clinton Administration official who now heads the United States 
Telephone Assn., predicted the new Congress will be "crankier and more ornery 
and partisan" than in the past. "I don't for a moment believe that a general 
spirit of cooperation will emerge from divided government next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Bliley is not talking for the record yet, but his political background gives 
some indications as to where his legislative interests may lie. 
</P>
<P>
 He co-sponsored the bill that led to the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1994 that 
passed the House but not the Senate. Bliley was also a key force behind a 
health care measure Republicans offered as an alternative to the Clinton 
Administration's sweeping plan, and effectively blocked Dingell from reporting 
Clinton's plan out of committee. 
</P>
<P>
 More tellingly, Bliley's Richmond-area congressional district is home to a 
major AT&T plant, as well as giant cigarette maker Philip Morris Co. As a 
result, he is expected to pay close attention to the tobacco industry and 
telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1987 and 1992, Bliley led the House in campaign donations from 
tobacco-linked interests and individuals, according to the Sunshine Press of 
Washington, a news service that focuses on campaign finance. But in the 18 
months ended in June, tobacco political action committees gave nearly 
comparable amounts to Bliley ($18,700) and Dingell ($14,000), according to the 
Center for Responsive Politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Rep. Jack Fields (R-Tex.), the likely head of the Energy and Commerce 
subcommittee that oversees telecommunications and finance, has huddled with 
Bliley and other Republicans to discuss putting telecommunications reform 
legislation back on the fast track. 
</P>
<P>
 Bliley is also expected to have an impact on other lesser-known issues that 
have galvanized the Energy and Commerce's subcommittees in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Bliley and Fields are likely to back away from efforts initiated by 
telecommunications and finance subcommittee Chairman Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) 
to impose new regulations to control allegedly violent television programs. 
Bliley is also expected to end Dingell's fledgling probe of the insurance 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would think that Mr. Bliley will clearly focus on deregulation and 
reshaping what he would regard as the Great Society programs," Rep. Ron Wyden 
(D-Ore.) said. "The challenges for him (are) to make sure that he can keep the 
scalpel on trimming true inefficiencies in government and not let his scalpel 
whack deeply into true human needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Wholey, a Washington lawyer and cable industry lobbyist who served as an 
aide to Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.), said many industry executives who once 
complained about excessive federal regulation may not be hankering to roll back 
the clock, even with their Republican friends in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a real sense that the Federal Communications Commission has 
overreached with its new cable rules . . . and some parts of the Cable Act 
passed by Congress (two years ago) are really bad," Wholey said. "But industry 
has already learned to live with much of the Cable Act, and it's almost as much 
trouble to undo it now as it is to get along with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Bliley's protection of the tobacco industry may prevent passage of 
any new regulatory initiatives. But, observers say, it's unlikely he will be 
able to roll back existing anti-smoking laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great (subcommittee) loss to lose Henry Waxman, who's been fighting 
the tobacco industry all of these years," said Elaine Lamy, executive director 
of Infact, a Boston-based anti-smoking group that strongly supported the 
California Democrat's efforts to impose further restrictions on the tobacco 
industry. "But polls have shown that the public firmly backs these advertising 
restrictions and (cigarette) excise taxes. There's no way those will be 
repealed." 
</P>
<P>
 And some skeptics, noting that Republicans, like Democrats, are interested in 
power and self-preservation, doubt that the GOP will follow through on its 
promise to significantly rein in Energy and Commerce.

ELECTIONS '94: IMPACT ON BUSINESS; GOP SWEEP MAY NOT REVERSE TIGHTENING OF 
PENTAGON BUDGET; MILITARY: DESPITE PARTY'S PLAN TO RESTORE $20 BILLION IN 
SPENDING, FINANCING FOR NEW PROGRAMS IS STILL INADEQUATE.; NEWS ANALYSIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 When the Republican Party swept into power in Congress this month, hopes were 
initially raised that weapons systems like the B-2 bomber, built by Northrop 
Grumman Corp., would get a new lease on life. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angles-based aerospace firm wants to sell the Pentagon 20 more B-2s 
for $11.4 billion. According to the company, that's a bargain basement price 
that would be a lot cheaper than alternative high-technology missiles and would 
preserve 13,000 jobs in California. 
</P>
<P>
 And Defense Secretary William Perry has quietly arranged to take his own 
demonstration flight in a B-2 bomber early next month -- the first time a 
non-pilot will fly in the two-seat cockpit and a signal about his interest in 
the future of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if Perry comes away ready to change his longstanding opposition to 
buying more B-2s and Republicans continue to press for a stronger military, the 
program still faces long odds -- just like the rest of the U.S. defense 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite recent Republican rhetoric about beefing up defense, the impact over 
the next few years is likely to be minuscule and certainly will do little to 
rescue California from the misery of its eight-year-long aerospace bust. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody in the defense industry who thinks this election is the salvation of 
their industry doesn't understand how the world has changed," said Loren 
Thompson, a defense industry consultant. "Being a conservative means many 
different things, and only one of those is pro defense. A lot of conservatives 
want to cut the deficit, cut taxes and cut government." At best, the new GOP 
majority may end the downward spiral in defense spending sooner than if the 
Democrats had remained in power, but it is hardly clear that even the 
Republicans are ready to immediately stop the spending decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Republicans have released a vague plan to add $20 billion to President 
Clinton's planned defense spending over the next five years -- a proposal that 
would still have the Pentagon budget going down until the end of the century 
after adjusting for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Steven Kosiak, an analyst at the Defense Budget Project, an independent 
watchdog group in Washington: "$20 billion doesn't do squat. If you wanted to 
freeze defense spending at today's level in real terms, you would have to add 
roughly $100 billion over the next five years." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with $20 billion in extra money, the Pentagon does not have the funds to 
buy all the weapons it has under development and, by some estimates, has $40 
billion to $150 billion in future programs that it might be unable to finance. 
</P>
<P>
 Another wrinkle in the outlook is that the Republicans would get their first 
shot at increasing funding in the fiscal year starting in October, 1995, but 
the actual "outlay" of that spending and its impact on the aerospace industry 
could take two years to be felt because of normal acquisition delays. So, it 
could be 1997 before anybody in Southern California sees some extra cash. 
</P>
<P>
 In nearly two weeks since the Republican landslide, the sobering reality of 
the defense budget crunch has extinguished much of the initial optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 Byron Callan, Merrill Lynch aerospace analyst, said that he has not raised a 
single earnings estimate for defense firms and has not upgraded his 
recommendations on any defense stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "People can talk, but there is no money in the bank," Callan said. "The 
November election didn't change the fiscal picture." 
</P>
<P>
 In large part, the rationale for Pentagon budgets has nothing to do with 
partisan politics, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The threat is the same today as it was last month and what we need to do 
about that is the same," said Booz Allen & Hamilton consultant John Harbison. 
"If you are leading one of these defense companies, the general direction is 
still cutting capacity." 
</P>
<P>
 One Pentagon official surmised that the new Republican majority will be less 
interested in voting large funding increases than in stopping non-military 
tasks and humanitarian missions -- which should free up funding for readiness 
and may take pressure off to further cut weapons production. 
</P>
<P>
 But even here it is hard to see how far Republicans can go. 
</P>
<P>
 About $3 billion of the Pentagon budget, for example, goes to defense 
conversion, aid to communities hurt by base closures and incentives for early 
retirement by military officers. Those activities do little for direct national 
security, but they have important political constituencies all over the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, cutting funding for such things as environmental cleanup, 
contaminated defense sites and helping with drug interdiction will not free a 
lot of money and would require changing a lot of different laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid such tough choices, Northrop Grumman's proposal for the Pentagon to buy 
more B-2s strikes some analysts as far-fetched. And yet, among all the defense 
programs, it has a better chance of success than many others. 
</P>
<P>
 As Republicans shake up the government, the Pentagon may be more likely to 
look seriously at reassigning its traditional "roles and missions" divided 
among the services. B-2 proponents think a good case can be made to rely on the 
B-2 for missions now performed by Navy nuclear missile submarines and aircraft 
carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 A study by retired Gen. Jasper Welch, conducted for Northrop, asserted 
recently that in fighting two major regional wars, the Pentagon will spend $70 
billion for advanced munitions, double the cost compared to what a fleet of 40 
B-2s would cost. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Navy will spend an estimated $4 billion to $8 billion to 
refurbish Trident submarines that carry nuclear missiles, a job that more B-2s 
could also perform.  
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), the designated chairman of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee, has been a longtime supporter of the B-2 bomber. And with 
B-2 critic Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Oakland) out of his job as chairman of the 
House Armed Services Committee, prospects for additional B-2 orders could 
improve. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Republicans were also a key force in the tough Senate fight earlier 
this year to provide Northrop with $125 million in funding to keep B-2 
subcontractors ready to resume production. Sens. Robert Dole, Ted Stevens, 
Alfonse D'Amato and Thurmond were among those who voted against an amendment to 
kill the funding. 
</P>

 "The B-2 may get another look," said one Air Force official knowledgeable 
about the Air Force's procurement agenda. "But we are still operating under the 
assumption that the Clinton budget cuts are in place. I don't see anybody doing 
handsprings down the hallway."

 Unemployment Tally Due to Be Released: The October jobless rate and local 
payroll employment statistics for Orange County are scheduled to be released 
today, and economy watchers say they are expecting the two reports to show at 
least a slight improvement in the county's job market. The most recent 
unemployment rate, for September, was 6% -- well below the statewide rate of 
8.2% but a tick up from the county's August jobless rate of 5.9%.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENTERPRISE; IMMIGRANT CASHES IN ON SOUNDS FROM HOME; 
IMPORTING: ENCINO FIRM CATERS TO THE TASTES OF IRANIANS WHO'VE SETTLED IN THE 
UNITED STATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 One might say Mehrdad Pakravan owes a lot to the late Ayatollah Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
 Pakravan, who emigrated from Iran in 1978, founded Caltex Trading Inc. in 
Encino in 1979. That same year, a militant Islamic revolution, led by Khomeini, 
ousted the government of the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, setting off a 
mass exodus of Iranians fleeing the control of conservative Islamic clergymen. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half a million Iranians would eventually settle in Southern California 
-- now the largest Persian community outside of Iran. Caltex Trading, now a 
$50-million holding company based in Canoga Park, has thrived serving the 
growing Persian immigrant community here and around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were not many outlets for Persian goods in 1979," said Pakravan, 40. 
Today, divisions of Caltex Trading, supply food and other products to 150 
Persian specialty stores in 45 states and abroad. Caltex is even a household 
name in Iran where millions of bootlegged cassettes of recordings by Persian 
pop musicians on the Caltex Record label circulate despite the government's ban 
on popular music. 
</P>
<P>
 The record division, whose stable of artist includes the popular Persian 
musician Bijan, is by far Caltex's largest, and most successful, division with 
annual sales of $35 million to $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Bijan, a violinist whose compositions are similar to American soft jazz 
styles, is considered the "Michael Jackson" of Persian music because of his 
extraordinary popularity in Persian communities. He recently sold out the Greek 
Theater in Los Angeles, leaving a thousand disappointed fans outside the gates. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Bijan, many Persian musicians defected to the entertainment capital of 
the world after the Islamic government banned nightclubs and non-traditional 
music, including romantic ballads. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Caltex has become the nucleus of a thriving Persian music scene in 
Southern California. The company has about 500 titles (including some of the 
oldest Persian songs in existence) and 50 artists on its label. It controls at 
least 75% of Persian artists on the market, the majority of whom are based in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Pakravan says his next goal is to bring contemporary Persian music into the 
mainstream of the American popular music scene. It's only a matter of the right 
marketing strategy, he declares. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltex artists produce a music that is "universal," says Pakravan, who acts as 
producer for all the musicians on the label. The music company has artists who 
both specialize in the traditional Persian music which goes back 3,500 years 
and others who have copied American popular styles. A lot of the traditional 
music uses instruments such as the tar, a predecessor of the guitar, and the 
oud, an old form of the banjo. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the Caltex artists "have a (traditional) Persian influence but sound 
totally contemporary," said Suzanne Doucet, a former German pop singer and 
Grammy committee member, who is in charge of promotion for Caltex's American 
market. "The music has not been introduced on the right track so they (American 
listeners) can go out, buy it and listen," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Contemporary Persian music has a mixture of Western pop, classical and soft 
jazz influences that appeals to so-called New Adult Contemporary (NAC) 
listeners, who enjoy it for meditation and contemplation, says Doucet. 
</P>
<P>
 Contemporary Persian music has been well received by fans of KPFK-FM's weekly 
world music show, which is heard from Bakersfield to Mexico, says KPFK's music 
director Mario Casetta. "I have had good responses and they like my 
selections," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the blend of pop and Persian sounds, "there is definitely a potential 
(for Persian music), especially in the dance genre," said Amy Sharafi, 
marketing and sales director for Beat magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 To attack the broader American market, Pakravan recently created Caltex 
Records International and a new label, called "Aladdin," to produce and market 
music by Persian artists specifically for American audiences. The company also 
set up a new division, Caltex Film Music, to produce music for movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Pakravan said he hopes Alladdin will be able to distribute 50 albums to major 
music retailers within the next three years. Artists on Aladdin will include 
Bijan and fellow Persian musicians Rohani, Siavash, and Farzin. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltex Records is just one way Pakravan's company has gained influence over 
Persian communities in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 His company also created and produces "Tanin," a popular Persian television 
show. The show, which feature Persian films, music videos, and talk about 
Persian culture and politics, airs weekly on KSCI, a local cable television 
channel. Created in 1992, the show can also be seen on the International 
Channel Network carried by cable companies and satellite services across the 
country. The company also packages and sells tapes of Tanin programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The smallest of the Caltex three subsidiaries is Caltex Foods, which sells 
Persian delicacies, including dehydrated vegetables, canned foods, and stews to 
various distributors.

 Utilities Rate Decision: The California Public Utilities Commission is 
expected to issue a final decision Tuesday that will set six investor-owned 
utilities' 1995 allowable return on equity -- a part of a regulated utility's 
version of profit margin. The annual process began this year with applications 
filed in May by the utilities, followed by those of other interested parties 
such as consumer groups.A PUC administrative law judge has held hearings on the 
applications. Generally higher returns compared to those of 1994 are ecommended 
this year, largely reflecting higher interest rates. Last year, for example, 
Southern California Edison Co. was allowed a return of 11%; next year, if 
accepted by the commissioners this week, the return will increase to 11.7%. 
Other utilities awaiting final word are Pacific Gas & Electric Co., San Diego 
Gas & Electric Co., Southern California Gas Co., Sierra Pacific Power Co. and 
Southwest Gas Corp., a Nevada-based company that distributes natural gas in 
some rural parts of California. The utilities' return on what they charge 
customers for power -- the other side of the profit picture for regulated 
utilities -- is decided every three years. Both processes would probably be 
replaced under the restructuring proposed for the state's electric utilities.

 Shopping Season Launch: Friday marks the official start of the 1994 Christmas 
shopping season -- the make-or-break selling time for most retailers.Most 
Southland shopping centers are preparing for the kickoff by opening their doors 
at 8 a.m., two hours earlier than normal. Surveys of local consumers and 
retailers show they expect holiday spending to increase this year. Many 
retailers and some industry analysts predict that demand for apparel will surge 
after several years of lackluster sales.

 Report on Dangerous Toys: As the Christmas shopping season gets under way this 
week, the California Public Interest Research Group will release a list of toys 
it says could pose a risk to young children.The organization says 11 of the 24 
toys on the list violate federal small-parts standards for toys designed for 
children younger than 3. Children could choke by swallowing such parts, CalPIRG 
said. Others on the list, which will be released Tuesday, emit dangerous noise 
levels or contain toxic chemicals, the group said. Some of the toys are in 
packaging that lacks adequate warnings of possible dangers, it said. CalPIRG 
will discuss its findings Tuesday morning at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in West 
Los Angeles.

 Kemper-Conseco Merger Falls Apart: Kemper Corp. and Conseco Inc. have called 
off their proposed merger, less than three weeks after Conseco lowered its 
original $3.25-billion bid by $290 million.Conseco, a Carmel, Ind.-based 
insurance company, in June offered $67 a share for Long Grove, Ill.-based 
Kemper, which has interests in insurance and financial services. Kemper 
accepted. But on Nov. 2, Conseco said rising interest rates were making 
debt-financing more expensive and lowered its bid to $2.96 billion, or $60 a 
share.

MCI TO OFFER SERVICES ACCESSING INTERNET; MULTIMEDIA: NATION'S NO. 2 
LONG-DISTANCE PHONE COMPANY IS ALSO EXPECTED TO INTRODUCE MARKETPLACEMCI, AN 
ELECTRONIC SHOPPING MALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 MCI Communications Corp., in a move to compete in the burgeoning on-line 
services industry, is expected to announce today services for accessing the 
Internet, the global computer network. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 2 U.S. long-distance company will introduce internetMCI, a portfolio 
of services that would give customers access to various services available on 
the Internet, including electronic mail, shopping, and high-speed access to 
browse through thousands of resources available on computers around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 MCI will also introduce marketplaceMCI, an electronic shopping mall, where 
retailers can sell merchandise to about 25 million Internet users. 
</P>
<P>
 The MCI service, which will begin in January, is the latest offering to 
compete against on-line companies like Prodigy, CompuServe and America Online, 
as well as other companies that provide direct links to the Internet. 
InternetMCI will also help MCI increase usage and revenue on its nationwide 
long-distance network. 
</P>
<P>
 "One reason MCI is pursuing this initiative is more and more companies are 
using the Internet for commerce and obviously . . . that provides minutes on 
our network," said an MCI executive, who requested anonymity. "For a 
communications company, it clearly puts us on the leading edge of the future." 
</P>
<P>
 MCI will charge consumers $49.95 for the Internet software, with access 
charges starting at $19.95 a month for seven hours of use. 
</P>
<P>
 MCI will provide broader access and speed to the Internet's resources than 
Prodigy, CompuServe and America Online. The three established on-line services 
provide limited access to Internet's libraries of software, statistics, 
pictures, video clips and music. 
</P>
<P>
 To browse the World Wide Web portion of the Internet, popular with on-line 
retailers, users need high-speed access, which the current on-line services 
can't provide. 
</P>
<P>
 By introducing internetMCI, the company expects to capitalize on the growth in 
on-line services industry, which is increasing by about 40% a year in revenue, 
according to some estimates. MCI expects merchandise retailing on the Internet 
to exceed $2 billion by the year 2000, up from about $200 million now, the 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 MCI is also working with retailers and information providers to design 
"storefronts," or advertisements, for marketplaceMCI when it opens early next 
year, an MCI executive said. Users will access the storefronts with a click of 
a computer mouse on a storefront icon or directory. 
</P>
<P>
 MCI hopes to be one of the world's largest carriers of Internet traffic. It 
now carries more than 40% of U.S. Internet traffic. With internetMCI, the 
company hopes to take the lead against its long-distance rivals, AT&T Corp. and 
Sprint Corp.

YOUR MONEY; THE IMPORTANCE OF FUND INVESTMENT STYLE; PORTFOLIO: EXPERTS AGREE 
THE MAJOR DISTINCTION FOR MOST INVESTORS IS BETWEEN GROWTH AND VALUE INVESTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY MORGAN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Does your fund manager have style? 
</P>
<P>
 We don't mean the Donna Karan dress or the Armani suit. 
</P>
<P>
 We're talking investment styles here: growth as opposed to value; top-down, 
macro-economic, sector-rotating, relative valuation, country allocation kind of 
style. Or maybe the always stylish bottoms-up look. 
</P>
<P>
 Fund names are supposed to give you a clue as to what your fund is doing. But 
sometimes the names are so bland that the descriptions are the next best thing 
-- if you can decipher them. Consider one newsletter's explanation of a couple 
of international funds. It labeled the first "a value-driven, 
top-down/bottoms-up blended investment style" and another a "combination of 
top-down analysis, with thorough price sensitive growth stock picking." 
</P>
<P>
 All this may sound esoteric, but investment style is important in designing a 
portfolio. And the comparison to clothing holds true: You have to decide what 
you feel comfortable with, how to accessorize it with a little mixing and 
matching of styles, and you have to be wary of the latest fashions. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts agree that the major distinction for most people is between growth and 
value investing, because these two styles cut across all categories, from 
small-cap to large to international funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply, value investors seek companies that are undervalued and decide what 
price to pay based on current earnings. Growth investors are willing to pay 
based on estimated future earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 These two styles tend to alternate with each other as the markets and the 
economy move higher and lower. Jay Gilburn, senior analyst for Value Line 
Mutual Funds, notes that some growth funds that did well from 1989 to 1992 when 
growth stocks were in vogue are doing poorly in the current value-stock cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Lipper, head of Lipper Analytical Services Inc., uses baseball 
metaphors to emphasize that investors should consider splitting their money 
among each kind of manager: "We believe in diversifying, because you don't want 
a lineup of all right-handed hitters." 
</P>
<P>
 That means you don't want to have only five growth funds in your portfolio, 
Gilburn said. It is probably better to have some value and some growth. 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond that, how much do investors need to know? Does it matter whether 
the manager has a top-down philosophy -- looking at the country and its economy 
first before looking for a company -- or a bottoms-up philosophy that seeks 
good companies and then analyzes them in the context of their industry, their 
location and the economy? Similarly, does it matter whether the manager uses 
computer models to pick stocks from his office, or lives on airplanes going 
from city to city in search of good companies? 
</P>
<P>
 "It matters more who is doing the thinking," said Manhattan financial planner 
Lewis Altfest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't think investors need to know all those things," agreed Kurt 
Brouwer, a partner in a San Francisco mutual fund advisory firm. "They need to 
see what kind of risk they are taking and how the fund has done compared with 
indexes. They want good, solid funds that have done well in down markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when managers talk about the top-down economic overlays on securities -- 
I don't think investors really need the masturbatory remarks." 
</P>
<P>
 John Markese, research director of the American Assn. of Individual Investors, 
doubts that most investors know or need to know if their managers are top-down 
or bottoms-up: "I don't know that there is any evidence that shows one to be 
better than the other." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, both Brouwer and Markese think bottoms-up stock pickers have 
been more successful, though they recognize that some managers can guess right 
about picking the right country at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter which theory lurks in the background, the style investors should 
care about most is one where their interests are foremost in the manager's mind 
at all times.

 Fixed-Asset Investment Slows: China's investment in fixed assets grew half as 
fast in October as it did in September due to government attempts to cool the 
economy. Economists watch fixed asset investment figures in China as a key 
inflation indicator and measure of economic overheating. The State Statistics 
Bureau reported that fixed asset investment by state units grew 22.5% in 
October over the year-earlier month, down from a 46.1% growth rate in 
September.

BIGGER PROFITS AREN'T BOOSTING SHARE PRICES; ECONOMY: AFTER FOUR YEARS OF 
FALLING EARNINGS, CORPORATE JAPAN IS COMING BACK. INVESTORS, HOWEVER, GREETED 
GOOD NEWS WITH YAWNS.

 Japanese camera maker Minolta Co. finally turned it around this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company trimmed its payroll by 1,300 workers. It built factories in 
Malaysia, China and Brazil, where wages are low, and cut production in Japan, 
where wages are high. And last week, it unveiled a new copier that works even 
with books that are lying face up. 
</P>
<P>
 The payoff: Minolta racked up its first midterm profit in four years. The 
company's performance was almost three times analysts' estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tokyo investors responded with a resounding yawn. Minolta's stock has 
fallen more than 4% since it announced the good news. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have done everything we could to cut production and labor costs," said 
Ichiro Shidai, a Minolta spokesman. "But in Japan, stocks don't always respond, 
no matter how good profits are." 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely has that been more true than this month, when most of Japan's publicly 
listed companies announce their half-year earnings. After four years of falling 
profits, corporate Japan is coming back. And yet Japan's stock market has been 
heading south. 
</P>
<P>
 Minolta is not the only company pondering the conundrum of rising profits and 
falling share prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamco Corp., which builds toilets for Boeing airplanes, stunned analysts by 
announcing a current profit of $3.5 million for the half-year that ended in 
September. That was almost seven times forecasts. But Jamco's stock has risen 
less than 1% since the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Takasago International, which provides sweet smells for Procter & Gamble 
products and grapefruit juice flavoring for a popular Japanese sports drink 
called Pocari Sweat, announced profits of $28.8 million. That beat estimates by 
77%. Its shares have fallen 2% since the news. 
</P>
<P>
 Plastics processor Takiron Co. has seen its shares fall 3% despite profits 
that were 110% higher than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 As Japan's midyear earnings season peaks today, with some 350 companies 
reporting, the story has been the same across industries. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Nikkei 225 companies have reported current profits 10% higher than 
earlier estimates, and they are expecting accelerated growth in the second half 
of the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors, traders and analysts say they have been waiting for just those 
kinds of positive numbers to breathe some life into Tokyo's ailing market. 
Instead, the Nikkei has fallen 3.3% since the earnings season began a month 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got an unhealthy market that is not responding to good news," said 
Scott Callon, chief market strategist at BT Asia Securities Ltd. "This market 
has a fundamental problem right now. It's called 'no buyers.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Where are the investors, and why aren't they responding to positive numbers? 
Analysts, traders and investors themselves say they are still uncertain about 
the Japanese economy, and earnings figures haven't helped clear their vision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought the shining earnings figures would be enough to attract investors 
back," said Minoru Maeda, general securities portfolio manager at Yamaichi 
Investment Trust Management Co. "But domestic, especially individual, investors 
are paralyzed. They have been burned so many times that they are afraid to 
believe the numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say investors are held hostage by the yen's strength, rising interest 
rates and skepticism about earnings. And until these negatives disappear, the 
market is likely to remain immune to good news. 
</P>
<P>
 The yen's strength has been the biggest concern. Japan's economy is powered by 
exports. So when the yen rises, earnings fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's major exporters -- Sony Corp., for example, or Nissan Motor Co. -- 
have projected profits with the assumption that the dollar will be trading at 
100 yen. The dollar is currently trading at 98 yen, and investors are worried 
it could tumble again to depths below 96 yen. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason stocks haven't responded is that investors think revenues got 
an unusual boost from a record-breaking heat wave this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumption soared as people scrambled to buy air conditioners, summer clothes 
and cold beverages to battle temperatures that reached 104 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market thinks it was a one-time boost in beverage sales that lifted our 
earnings," said Masaru Takada, managing director at Takasago International. But 
he said Takasago has also benefited from cost reduction and increasing 
production abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock prices were underpinned by hopes the summer surge in consumption would 
trigger a strong rebound in Japan's economy. But spending has slowed, leaving 
investors unsure whether current earnings just reflect more thirsty sunbathers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a hangover after the strong numbers over the summer," said Tim 
Hayashida, strategy associate at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the problem is that stock prices are too high. They were pumped up 
by foreigners who were overly optimistic about Japan's economic prospects, 
government fund managers who have used public money to prop up the market and 
brokerage dealers who try to blow up every increase into a rally.

 Agency Declares Recession Officially Over: The Economic Planning Agency said 
the recession that crippled Japan for 30 months officially ended in October, 
1993. The recession, which the agency said began in May, 1991, is the second 
longest since the end of World War II, following a 36-month slump in the early 
1980s after the second oil shock.

CHINESE YOUTHS SAMPLE U.S. TRADITION; CULTURE: SEVENTY-FIVE EXCHANGE STUDENTS 
EXPERIENCE AN AMERICAN-STYLE SUNDAY PICNIC AT WARNER CENTER PARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They looked like any other bunch of kids on an outing to the park as they 
tossed a football back and forth, chased each other in circles and kicked a 
soccer ball in the midmorning sun. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the 75 Chinese exchange students, Sunday's excursion to Warner Center 
Park was their first taste of an American-style picnic, complete with the 
staples of hot dogs, potato chips, ice cream sandwiches and a few friends. 
</P>
<P>
 After some stiff introductions in English and Chinese, the exchange students, 
who arrived in the San Fernando Valley in September, warmed up to a group of El 
Camino High School students who hosted the picnic with the Rotary Club of 
Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 A simple ice-breaking game helped cross the language barrier as small groups 
of youths held hands -- crossing them over each other -- and then tried to 
untangle themselves, giggling and smiling as their hands strained to stay 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 Games of soccer and horseshoes also helped the exchange students unwind from 
their rigorous routine of school six days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 After two months at Hale Junior High School in Woodland Hills, where they 
study English and take typing and physical education classes with American 
sixth-graders, the exchange students' language skills are still a bit shaky. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest thing has been to learn English," said Pan Hui Shan, 12. "But we 
want to try." 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino student Sabra Martini, 15, said although there was a language 
barrier between the students as they played, "we could still understand each 
other. They still caught on to what we were doing." 
</P>
<P>
 There are a few parks near their school in China, Lin Li, 11, said, but none 
as big as Warner Center Park. "The trees and the grass are nice," Li said. "We 
don't have much of that in China." 
</P>
<P>
 As Zhong Shun Ping, 13, sat down to eat her lunch, she reflected on what she 
likes most about America. "It is more relaxing here," Ping said. "The whole 
community is nice." 
</P>
<P>
 The students, here as part of the China/United States Business and Technology 
Exchange, will be in the country until June.

BANKING ON BIG BIRD; AREA'S OSTRICH RANCHERS HOPE TO WIN OVER PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than a dozen ostrich ranchers in north Los Angeles County have banded 
together to trade breeding tips and promote their big birds as the lucrative 
new livestock of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the loose-knit High Desert Ostrich Ranchers want other people to 
pull their heads out of the sand and pay attention to the range of products 
ostriches yield, from head to toe. 
</P>
<P>
 An ostrich produces lean, red meat, a hide that can be turned into fashionable 
boots and feathers that can become part of dusting tools. Its toenails can be 
used as a jeweler's abrasive. Even the birds' tendons, corneas and beaks have 
medical applications, the breeders boast. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a product on the bird that goes to waste," says Dick White, a 
Leona Valley rancher who helped organize the group. 
</P>
<P>
 White, a former cattle rancher who began breeding ostriches in 1989, now has 
one of the area's biggest businesses, with 152 of the flightless, big-eyed 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, White helped found the California chapter of the American 
Ostrich Assn. Earlier this year, he and other breeders from northern Los 
Angeles County, plus a few in neighboring Kern County, decided to form a local 
group to exchange ideas and promote the fledgling industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, several members set up an information display at the Antelope 
Valley Fair, bringing along several young ostriches to catch the attention of 
visitors strolling through the swine and sheep pens. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is now in the process of selecting officers and signing up new 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Some north county ranchers who are just getting into the ostrich business say 
they've learned a lot through their ties to the new association. Bob Loving, a 
retired construction superintendent who bought three pairs of breeding birds 
two years ago, said fellow ranchers rushed to offer assistance recently when 
one of his ostriches became ill. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I love about this business is that there are so many great people, and 
they're willing to share information," said Loving, who lives in Agua Dulce. 
"If you have a problem with your bird, they'll come over and help you. Nobody 
holds anything back. People are just willing to share the information." 
</P>
<P>
 The word about ostriches is indeed getting around. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranchers say the big birds grow to a height of eight feet, weigh up to 350 
pounds and can run up to 45 m.p.h. Although they are relatively docile, male 
ostriches become highly aggressive during breeding season and can inflict 
serious injuries with their powerful feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Byers is the first to admit she and her husband didn't do much research 
before they spent $35,000 for a breeding pair of ostriches last year. The 
couple run a brush clearance and firewood business based in Castaic. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a major brainstorm of my husband's, that this was an up-and-coming 
industry," Byers said. "We thought we could get into it and start making major 
money and get out of our (other) business." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, many of their ostrich eggs didn't hatch, and many of the 
chicks that did emerge were not healthy. The ranchers were forced to trade one 
surviving 2-month-old chick to their veterinarian to wipe out a $2,000 
treatment bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Byers said her husband often asks where the family's savings have gone. "I 
say, 'It's walking around in the back yard,' " she said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple plan to stick with ostrich farming for at least one more year, 
trying to pick up tips from more successful members of High Desert Ostrich 
Ranchers. "It's a fun industry," she said. "The more people you meet that have 
ostriches, the more you can learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Leona Valley rancher White says he has learned a lot since the day he bought 
his first two pairs of breeding ostriches five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as prices for the cattle he had been raising for two decades were 
dropping, White read an article that hailed ostriches as the livestock of the 
future because the birds produce meat that tastes like beef, but has far less 
cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
 The ostrich industry, long centered in South Africa, began to blossom in the 
United States in the mid-1980s, particularly in Texas and Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 As the numbers increase, more ostrich meat, now selling for $15 to $30 a 
pound, will begin showing up on the menus of gourmet restaurants and 
steakhouses, Ball predicted. That would suit Dick White just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather work with the birds than with cattle," he said.

 Jeanne Wallace works for the Palmdale Post Office, usually sorting the mail 
and delivering along city routes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the high point of her week is Monday, when she drives the Leona Valley 
rural route through a mountain community about 10 miles west of Palmdale. 
Darting her dark blue 1973 Jeep on and off Elizabeth Lake Road to fill the 
roadside mailboxes, she savors the scenery and talks with the people she meets 
along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace, 35, lives in Palmdale with her husband, Randy, and their six 
children. Sitting in her living room with the kids darting about, she spoke 
about her once-a-week life on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a rural carrier was kind of my calling, but I didn't know it. I just 
kind of fell into it. It's so rewarding and it's so satisfying. I love being 
outside. It beats working 9 to 5 in any store, anywhere, any day. 
</P>
<P>
 Being way out there in the country, nothing compares to it. I don't care if it 
rains. I don't care how hot it is. I don't care, I want to be outside. 
</P>
<P>
 It gets pretty hot in the summertime because we're in the desert. 105 in Leona 
Valley, 120 out in Little Rock. But it's nice, because you can go in and use 
someone's hose and get all wet, and you're nice and cool. One day it was about 
110 and I was on 90th (Street), and this guy was watering his flowers. I asked 
him if I could have a drink and he said, 'Sure.' Then I just stood there and I 
said, 'Squirt me.' 
</P>
<P>
 He was like, 'No way.' I said, 'Yes, come on, just squirt me, I want to be 
soaking wet.' I turned around and let him drench me; that way it took longer to 
dry. You keep a lot cooler that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Last winter it rained a lot. Water was coming down Leona Avenue so fast and 
there was so much of it that it looked like a raging river. Your Jeep is so 
high up, you know you're safe, but it's still scary. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm an RCA, Rural Carrier Associate, which is a (substitute). I've been a sub 
for five years. It's really hard to get your own route, but someday that's what 
I want. I'd like this to be my career. 
</P>
<P>
 The Leona Valley route has about 500 boxes and over 60 miles of driving. I can 
do the route in 3 1/2 hours, but I like to take my time because it's so 
relaxing and it's so beautiful. San Francisquito Road is the end of my route. 
The ride out there is breathtaking. 
</P>
<P>
 One time I was way out on Elizabeth Lake Road and I saw a deer standing in 
this meadow eating grass, just standing there. I felt just like I was in the 
mountains way far away in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way back in, there's a cherry orchard and I like to take my break 
there. There's a little white fence, and I just sit on the fence and look 
around. It's really pretty, lots of rolling hills. I like to sit there and 
relax and organize my Jeep. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody I've ever met there is real small-town, friendly-like. Once you 
start talking to them, they'll tell you their whole life story, if you sit 
there long enough. But, I've got to deliver the mail too. But there's enough 
time for both. 
</P>
<P>
 When I first started I had a Mustang, a regular left-hand-drive car. I used to 
sit in the middle on the console, on a towel, because it had bucket seats, and 
drive with my left hand and use my left foot: gas, brake, gas, brake, put the 
mail out the right-hand window. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I bought a Jeep, a '73; it was older than dirt. My first Jeep was 'Old 
Betsy.' Poor 'Old Betsy,' I miss that Jeep. It was the first real job I ever 
had, so my Jeep meant a lot to me. It helped me, it was my partner. 
</P>
<P>
 I had that Jeep two years and then the transmission went out of it up on Godde 
Hill Pass. I had to put it in reverse to get to the top, then coasted down to 
the bottom and drove to the Leona Valley Post Office in reverse, on the right 
side of the road, but in reverse. I called the Palmdale Post Office, and they 
brought me a regular government Jeep that I could use until I bought the Jeep 
that I have now. 
</P>
<P>
 My Jeeps are my partners. I feel close to them. I love my Jeeps. I always pat 
my Jeep in the morning, 'Come on, let's go to work now.' "

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; PAY FOR CITY MANAGER, ATTORNEY DUE 
DEBATE 
</P>

<P>
 Evaluating the city attorney and city manager in public session, Thousand Oaks 
council members Tuesday will consider whether to dole out merit raises to the 
two officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on their performances, which he rated highly, Councilman Frank Schillo 
said he would recommend raises of 3% or 4% for them.But, like his colleagues, 
he said he could not fix a fair number until after the public debate Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Grant Brimhall, who earns $121,860 a year, is one of the county's 
best-paid officials. But he has not received a raise -- not even a 
cost-of-living boost -- since 1991. Three years ago, he turned down a proposed 
pay hike because of his concern about the city's tight budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (Brimhall) has done an excellent job," Councilwoman Judy Lazar said, 
arguing in favor of a raise. "We've had to deal with some tough financial 
situations and we have come out in relatively good shape." 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Mark Sellers received a 5% pay increase two years ago, lifting his 
annual base salary to $97,920. He still earns less than some city staff with 
long tenure, including Planning Director Phil Gatch and Assistant City Manager 
MaryJane Lazz. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we're having public hearings and we need advice right away, (Sellers) 
has steadfastly been able to do that," Schillo said. "He has done a very good 
job. I believe he deserves a raise." 
</P>
<P>
 The city manager and city attorney are the only officials who report directly 
to the City Council. Most employees and department heads report to Brimhall, 
who conducts regular performance reviews and authorizes merit raises. STEPHANIE

MAN, 19, SLAIN AFTER AN ARGUMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 19-year-old Pacoima man, who followed two men after an argument, died when 
he was shot in the head, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Estrada and his cousin were at a fast-food restaurant Friday night when 
they exchanged harsh words with two men in a light yellow Cadillac Seville, 
said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Ron Spear. 
</P>
<P>
 The men asked Estrada where he was from and when Estrada didn't answer, they 
drove off, Spear said. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada and his cousin followed the two men to 60th Street West and Avenue K, 
where Estrada got out of his car and approached the other driver's window, 
Spear said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was another exchange of words before the driver of the Cadillac said, 
'You punk,' and fired one round from a handgun, striking Estrada in the head," 
Spear said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spear said Estrada was pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men drove north on 60th Street and are still at large, Spear said.

REPAIRS TO BEGIN ON BRIDGES, WALKWAYS; RECOVERY: THREE OF THE 11 VALENCIA SPANS 
HAVE BEEN CLOSED BECAUSE OF QUAKE DAMAGE. THE $833,000 COST WILL BE FINANCED BY 
FEMA, A DEVELOPER AND HOMEOWNERS.

<P>
 Repairs are scheduled to begin this week on 11 public bridges and walkways in 
Valencia that were damaged in the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the repairs, estimated at $833,000, will be paid with a 
combination of federal earthquake recovery grants, funds from the developer who 
built the walkway system and fees collected from Valencia homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency will cover $473,000 of the cost, while 
the Newhall Land & Farming Co. has agreed to provide $100,000 for engineering 
work. The remaining portion from homeowners will come from an annual fee they 
pay into a maintenance district fund administered by Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as paseos, the Spanish term for public walkways, the elaborate network 
of paths and bridges is a signature amenity of Newhall Land's master-planned 
Valencia community, begun in 1967. The paseo system, 20 miles long, includes 
about 20 elevated walkways and sunken street crossings. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the bridges have been closed because of earthquake damage. Many 
others will undergo minor repairs or cosmetic improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the work is earthquake repair. Some of the work is seismic 
strengthening for future earthquakes," Santa Clarita city engineer Tony Nisich 
said. "Then the rest of it is cosmetic." 
</P>
<P>
 Repairs were initially scheduled to begin in September and be completed this 
month. Delays occurred as Santa Clarita pursued FEMA funding and because only 
one construction company bid to perform the work, causing the city to extend 
the bidding process. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members voted 5 to 0 this week to award the construction project 
to Parr Contracting Co. of Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the cost-sharing deal, Santa Clarita officials have agreed to 
assume ownership -- and therefore liability -- for the bridges. The decision 
settled a pre-earthquake disagreement, first erupting in 1993, over who was 
responsible for their upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall Land officials said the trails were the same as other amenities first 
built by a developer and then made the responsibility of those who benefit from 
them. City and county officials contended that because Newhall Land built them, 
it should maintain them.
