ALL IN THE FAMILY; WHAT DOES COLOR MEAN IF YOU CAN CHOOSE YOUR RACE?; THE 
SWEETER THE JUICE: A FAMILY MEMOIR IN BLACK AND WHITE, BY SHIRLEE TAYLOR

<TEXT>
<P>
 It seems like a story from another age: light-skinned black people who decide 
to "pass" for white, shunning their darker relatives and their black 
communities for a "better" life. The theme of the tragic mulatto -- central in 
such popular movies and novels as "Imitation of Life," "Pinky" and Nella 
Larsen's "Passing" -- was common throughout the first half of the 20th Century. 
As we edge toward the 21st Century, carrying with us the legacy of the Civil 
Rights movement, these stories seem antiquated, like the browning image of an 
old photo. 
</P>
<P>
 In her family memoir, "The Sweeter the Juice," Shirlee Taylor Haizlip reminds 
us that "the past is prologue." Having grown up in Connecticut, the child of a 
prominent (dark-skinned) Baptist minister, she enjoyed a life of comfort that 
she rarely questioned. It wasn't until she was much older that she began to 
look for the missing links in her mother's life. She knew they were there: 
</P>
<P>
 "Three of my grandparents died before I was born. The remaining one, my 
mother's father, William Morris, whom my mother called Willmorris (I heard it 
as one word), was inaccessible to me. As a 'white' man who could not admit 
colored people into his world, he lived a distant life in a distant place. I 
knew he was alive, because whenever the subject of her father came up, my 
mother, with uncharacteristic venom, referred to him as 'Wilmorris 
that-bastard-in-Maryand'. . . This need, this pain of my mother's became mine. 
Her loss and rejection gave shape to development. It touched me in ways I am 
yet unable to fathom. As my mother approached her eightieth birthday, I made a 
conscious decision to use whatever means possible to find her family. I knew 
that I would find them." 
</P>
<P>
 Haizlip discovered many things in the process, beginning with a grandfather 
and a slew of fair-skinned relatives who had "disappeared" into the white 
world, leaving Haizlip's mother, who was very light herself, and a younger 
brother behind. 
</P>
<P>
 With the dedication of a skilled investigative reporter, Shirlee Taylor 
Haizlip hunts down her family tree -- both black and white. Her discoveries 
lead her to the startling conclusion that there is no such thing as "real white 
Americans": 
</P>
<P>
 "Some geneticists have said that 95% of 'white' Americans have widely varying 
degrees of black heritage. According to 'The Source: A Guidebook of American 
Genealogy' (edited by Arlene H. Eakle and Johni Cerny, Ancestry Publishers, 
Salt Lake City, 1984: $39.95; 786 pp.), 75% of all African-Americans have at 
least one white ancestor and 15% have (a) predominantly white blood line. . . . 
As Adrian Piper wrote (in Transition 58, 1993), 'The longer a person's family 
has lived in this country, the higher the probable percentage of African 
ancestry -- bad news for the DAR, I'm afraid.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In Haizlip's own family line, she finds a prominent white judge, James D. 
Halyburton, federal judge of the Eastern District of Virginia from 1844-1861. 
She also finds that her great-grandmother, Margaret Mahler, was an Irish 
immigrant who married not only one "mulatto" man (Haizlip's great-grandfather), 
but after his death, another "colored" man. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the memoir's most touching scenes is when Margaret Mahler's father, an 
Irish immigrant turned successful American entrepreneur, shows up offering to 
take care of her and her child -- on the condition that she leave her "colored" 
husband. Margaret replies that her husband, "colored" or not, was, to her, "the 
best man that ever was" -- and promptly refused her father's affection and 
wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the relatives who chose to pass, Haizlip deftly deals with the hows and 
whys -- no easy task, considering her mother's pain at being ostracized by her 
"white" relatives for more than 75 years. Through Haizlip's efforts, her mother 
and her Aunt Grace, who has lived all her life as a white woman, were reunited 
in 1992. Despite the obvious joy of the reunion, the author realizes: "It was 
just as well that after this visit, they would be three thousand miles apart. 
Race still separated them. I understood now in ways that I had not that Grace 
was indeed white. She could not give up being white, nor could she tear down 
the alabaster walls she had built around her life. She would be content to see 
us as often as we might like to visit, as long as no one in her circle knew who 
or what we were. In other words, she would be satisfied to continue the pattern 
of the past." 
</P>
<P>
 The very notion that one could choose to be black or white shows how 
meaningless the delineation of race can be. On the other hand, the fact that 
there are those who find being "white" so much easier, psychologically and 
economically, shows how heavy the burden of racism can be. But when a person 
chooses to be "white," it is always at a cost, a point that Haizlip makes 
painfully clear in this passage about a great aunt and uncle she discovered: 
</P>
<P>
 "Ruth and John had no children. Some in the family say it was because they 
feared their genes would tell: They might give birth to a brown child. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The year my great-uncle John died I graduated from high school. I did not 
know about this interesting man who liked to catch butterflies and loved books 
until I began to do research on my family. Once again, I felt anger over being 
deprived of an older relative that I would love to have known. It is likely he 
would not have wanted to know me. He was a loyal American and a loyal Harvard 
man, but he did not claim his blackness." 
</P>
<P>
 A resident of Los Angeles, Haizlip takes interesting note of California's 
special appeal to blacks who wanted to pass: Here was a place far away from the 
South and the East -- far from those communities where relatives might give 
away their secret. 
</P>
<P>
 She points to Lyle Saxon's 1937 novel, "Children of Strangers," about 
Louisiana Creoles. When the protagonist, a light-skinned black man, decides to 
pass, he tells his mother: "I've left Chicago for good and all, and I'm going 
to California where I don't know nobody at all. I've crossed the line in 
Chicago, but it's dangerous there. Too many people know that I'm not white. On 
the coast, nobody will ever know. I'm going and I'm breaking off clean with the 
people I've known." 
</P>
<P>
 This memoir marks not only a new and necessary chapter in American racial 
history, but the debut of a fine writer as well. "I have been called Egyptian, 
Italian, Jewish, French, Iranian, Armenian, Syrian, Spanish, Portuguese and 
Greek," Haizlip writes. "I have also been called black and Peola and nigger and 
high yellow and bright. I am an American anomaly. I am an American ideal. I am 
the American nightmare. I am the Martin Luther King dream. I am the new 
America." 
</P>
<P>
 May this stirring American voice tell us many more stories.

WALLED IN BY WORDS; IN TOUCH: THE LETTERS OF PAUL BOWLES, EDITED BY JEFFREY 
MILLER (FARRAR, STRAUS & GIROUX: $30; 604 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Daniel Harris, Daniel Harris is a free-lance critic and essayist. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In "A Distant Episode," one of Paul Bowles's most famous short stories, a 
linguist studying native dialects in Morocco asks the owner of a cafe to help 
him find a local curio: boxes made of camel udders. For reasons left 
unspecified, the owner takes offense, lures him onto the desert and dumps him 
amid a group of nomadic thieves who, siccing their dogs, ambush him in the 
darkness, beating him unconscious and then yanking his tongue taut to hack it 
off at its root. Tarted up like a scarecrow in a net of wire and tin cans, he 
is stuffed in a sack and lugged around for an entire year from encampment to 
encampment where he is "emptied out" before crowds of other Bedouins who put 
him through his paces, an endless sequence of cartwheels, obscene gestures and 
somersaults. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowles evokes the gratuitous violence of this event through an intricate 
series of omissions, of things left unsaid, the peripheral but nonetheless 
vital information that shadows everything he chooses to include. 
</P>
<P>
 We are, for instance, deprived all access to the linguist's thought during his 
abduction and mutilation so that he is finally reduced to an insentient bundle 
of tin and motley, which is summarily wadded up and slung like a parcel over a 
camel. Never once does Bowles show him formulating plans for escape, thinking 
aloud, pleading with his captors or feeling fear, disgust, shame. 
</P>
<P>
 The most conspicuous omission of all, however, is the reaction of horror on 
the part of the narrator, who, rather than engaging in anguished dialogues with 
his readers, relates these events almost mechanically, thereby allowing them to 
register with their full concussive force. 
</P>
<P>
 We are always searching for the expression on Bowles's face as we read the 
story, for a grimace, a wince, a wry mouth, for some gesture of empathy and 
compassion that will enable us to discover what reassuringly familiar attitude 
-- shock, regret, disapproval -- he is inviting us to assume toward the 
professor's kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bowles is never forthcoming, and the face that hovers mistily behind his 
narrative is stony and impassive, the mysterious and utterly indifferent mask 
of the witness. 
</P>
<P>
 While Bowles' impersonality as a narrator contributes to the violence of his 
short stories, it also contributes to the self-effacing quality of "In Touch," 
a somewhat disappointing collection of more than six decades of letters that 
span virtually the entire 20th Century, from Bowles' days in the late 1920s as 
an ether-sniffing surrealist enrolled at the University of Virginia to his 
present life as an expatriate in Tangier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe," he once responded to the complaints of a close friend 
exasperated by his systematic avoidance of personal disclosures or, for that 
matter, even a trace of introspection and analysis, "that you find a similarity 
between my letters and a seed catalogue," an unflattering comparison whose 
accuracy he took in stride, agreeing with Gore Vidal that "if you get a letter 
from Paul, it's about what he had for breakfast." 
</P>
<P>
 In his curiously flat, if amazingly conscientious, correspondence, Bowles 
exercises the same refusal to editorialize, to intervene in the action, to step 
out from behind the screen of authorial omniscience, that heightens the 
remorselessness of stories that even as a child caused his apprehensive 
grandmother, in some sense his most discerning literary critic, to plead with 
him, at the ghoulish age of 6, to "write about pretty things instead of horrid 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 But if, by his own admission, he has never been a good letter writer but has 
filled his voluminous correspondence with details about such things as the 
death of his green parrot, which was found "in rigor mortis, on the bathroom 
shelf," or his wife's wig, which was found "in the hatbox with the egghead 
Sonia made a face on," he has always been an indefatigably loyal and prolific 
letter writer. 
</P>
<P>
 As early as the late 1920s, he established lifelong epistolary pacts with a 
vast circle of writers, artists and musicians whom he met when he dropped out 
of college in 1929 at the age of 19 and ran away to Paris, thus beginning the 
life of incessant travel that made letter writing indispensable to his 
emotional survival in places as far-flung as Bangkok and Sri Lanka. 
</P>
<P>
 While living abroad as a young man in the 1930s and scrambling to make ends 
meet, he succumbed to the enticements of a frenzied social life and, to the 
detriment of his letters, which occasionally disintegrate into dizzying lists 
of famous contacts, was introduced to an entire host of pivotal 20th-Century 
figures, whose names he drops with implausible nonchalance. 
</P>
<P>
 The major stars of the European avant-garde parade through these pedestrian 
jottings: Jean Cocteau, Marcel Duchamp, Andre Gide, Virgil Thomas and even 
Gertrude Stein, who adopted this eccentric dandy, reeking of homemade 
patchouli, as one of her prize proteges. 
</P>
<P>
 Perennially broke and yet, as one acquaintance called him, "a virtuoso at 
being taken care of," he pursued his studies in music and poetry by sponging 
off many of his wealthy friends, who helped him to achieve fame on Broadway as 
the composer of the incidental music for "The Glass Menagerie" and "South 
Pacific." 
</P>
<P>
 Only in 1949 with the publication of his best-selling novel "The Sheltering 
Sky" (which Bertolucci was later to make into a film) would he finally receive 
recognition for what he is known as today, the elder statesman of the American 
short story as well as an eminent novelist, the last surviving and, in my mind, 
the best of the so-called Lost Generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the complicated career of this inveterate traveler, who deliberately 
settled in countries far away from the United States, which he once reviled as 
"a degenerate adolescent giant on a rampage," it is surprising that his letters 
rarely rise to the level of much more than trivial postcards about such things 
as the cost of his electric bill or the extraction of two teeth, the prosaic 
details he dubbed "my seed cataloguing of the day." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for their banality is that, while he has led an extremely active 
social and personal life, including a tumultuous 35-year marriage to the 
novelist Jane Bowles (a bitterly unhappy woman who spent much of the 1950s and 
1960s traipsing in and out of mental institutions), he finds boredom and 
monotony the states most conducive to writing and composing. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, his letters are weakened by his aversion to confessional prose, 
which he views as symptomatic of the cult of personality so characteristic of 
American literature, the inane obsession with gossip that led his good friend 
Tennessee Williams to perform in his memoirs what Bowles contemptuously refers 
to as a "striptease of the soul." 
</P>
<P>
 Even when one is unwillingly disrobed by someone else, Bowles is appalled by 
the results of such exhibitionism. In reference to Christopher 
Sawyer-Laucanno's mediocre biography "An Invisible Spectator" (published in 
1989), Bowles objected so vigorously to the author's violation of his privacy 
that, after the "unfortunate volume" appeared without the promised caption "an 
unauthorized biography" on its title-page, he strongly "regret(ted) not having 
arranged for his poisoning on his first visit to Tangier." 
</P>
<P>
 In light of his fierce guardedness, one can't help but wondering if he would 
also have been well advised to have served something out of "The Lucrezia 
Borgia Cookbook" to the editor of "In Touch" as well.

RECOVERING WHAT WAS LOST; THE GREEN KNIGHT, BY IRIS MURDOCH (VIKING: $23.95; 
472 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Judith Freeman, Judith Freeman, author of The Chinchilla Farm and Set for 
Life, is currently writing a book about India. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the strangest and perhaps most inexplicable aspects of contemporary 
American literature is the seemingly inverse correlation between life and 
fiction: The more complex our everyday existence has become, the more spartan 
and minimal the literature of recent decades has appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so with English novels. The Age of Minimalism seems hardly to have grazed 
the sensibility of fiction writers across the sea. Think of Michael Indaatje's 
"The English Patient," V. S. Naipaul's "The Enigma of Arrival" or Marina 
Warner's remarkable "Indigo." These novels, laden with complexity and a 
richness of language, seem much more directly connected to the great literary 
works of the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 The same can be said for Dame Irish Murdoch's 25th work of fiction, "The Green 
Knight," a vast moral and intellectual tour de force, set in contemporary 
London, that draws on myriad sources -- Meister Ekhart, Beowulf, Hamlet, 
Goethe, Wittengenstein, biblical and Arthurian legends, to name a few -- to 
create a work of deep philosophical, religious and ontological concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 In her previous novels -- "The Sea, the Sea" and "The Nice and the Good" come 
to mind -- Murdoch explored similar terrain. The moral underpinnings of human 
behavior and the extremes to which people will go to satisfy the most inchoate 
longings for justice and redemption are just some of her recurring themes. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Green Knight," Murdoch again stirs up the murky opposites of good and 
evil to set up the fundamental tension in her story, which is based on the 
biblical tale of Cain and Abel. Lucas Graffe, a middle-aged scholar and 
historian who has long harbored a resentment toward his half-brother Clement, 
attempts to murder him with a baseball bat in a park one night. Quite 
inadvertently a strangerby the name of Peter Mir turns up at the wrong moment 
and takes the blow instead. 
</P>
<P>
 It is assumed that Peter Mir is dead, and Lucas Graffe, brought to justice, is 
acquitted of murdering him after convincing a judge that he was only defending 
himself from a mugger. But Peter Mir is not dead. He effects a miraculous 
recovery -- "just like Lazarus," as someone in the novel says -- and returns to 
confront his attacker, from whom he desires a strange form of retribution. 
</P>
<P>
 What Peter Mir most wants from Lucas Graffe in repayment for his attack is 
something quite unexpected. He wishes to be admitted into Lucas's circle of 
family and friends. Peter is lonely; he wants a family and the sort of intimate 
relations he's been denied thus far in life. He also wishes to regain some 
essential part of his consciousness he believes he lost when he suffered the 
blow on the head and which he feels only Lucas can help restore. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas Graffe's "family" includes an odd assortment of people to whom he is 
related less by blood than long-standing association. At the center of this 
group is a widow named Louise Anderson and her three "perfect" and beautiful 
teen-age daughters, as well as a homosexual couple, a religious seeker about to 
enter a monastery and several single women, all of whom are initially confused 
by Peter Mir's sudden appearance in their midst. Is he a devil or an angel? 
Does he intend to disrupt their lives and bring them harm, or is he an agent of 
reconciliation and redemption? 
</P>
<P>
 Murdoch is exploring a number of interesting ideas, among them the notion that 
inclusion in a warm and happy family has become such a rare and longed-for 
condition in our time that one is willing to resort to blackmail in an attempt 
to achieve it. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the novel, however, is a much deeper and much more subtle 
idea, summed up by an oft-repeated quote from Meister Eckhart: "Do not seek for 
God outside your own soul." Every character in the novel must eventually take 
this advice to heart, and it is the soul-searching -- so brilliantly rendered 
by Murdoch's dialogue and her examination of the inner psychology of everyone 
involved (there's even an extraordinary passage recording the thoughts of a 
lost dog wandering the streets of London) -- that gives the novel its depth and 
ultimately its power. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Peter Mir is able to recover the consciousness he so misses -- 
"the little light" that he feels he lost as a result of the blow on his head 
and which turns out to be nothing more, and nothing less, than the remembrance 
of the principle of universal love that he had learned from his previous study 
of Buddhism, and then forgotten. At the same time, each member of his adopted 
family is so affected by their experience of him they are brought into the 
circle of magic where the heart's true desires are made apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 One puts down this novel with a feeling of having feasted at a table of great 
ideas. Never mind the small glitches, the fact that teen-agers sound so wise 
and evolved that their dialogue is indistinguishable from that of 50-year-old 
scholars, or the plot that takes fantastic, almost unbelievable turns. Much can 
be forgiven when so much is finally delivered. And much is delivered here. One 
can say in the end, virtuti paret robur -- strength obeys virtue. In such a 
virtuous work, strength is the natural, perhaps the inevitable result.

RICHARD EDER: LIFE IN A CHINESE OPERA; RED AZALEA, BY ANCHEE MIN (PANTHEON: 
$22; 306 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At home, Anchee Min's family was squeezed into two rooms shared with two other 
Shanghai families. From the age of 5, Min writes, she had to be an adult, 
tending her three younger siblings, Blooming, Coral and Space Conqueror -- her 
father combined a private passion for astronomy with a public regard for Maoist 
oratory -- until her parents got home late at night. Min's mother would arrive 
in a near faint from her grueling factory job, and the four little children had 
to revive her with wet cloths and back rubs. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the early 1960s. Min's formerly middle-class family struggled in 
poverty and the din and watchfulness of the Cultural Revolution. Her mother 
tended to misstep. As a teacher she was had up by her colleagues for using the 
wrong ideogram in a poster and turning its message from "Long Long Life to Mao" 
to "No No Life for Mao." Her apology was accepted but she was banished to 
factory work when one of the squares of newspaper she used at stool was 
vigilantly found to contain a photograph of the leader. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Min, like many bright and nervy children she flew like the sparks, 
upward. If you were a brilliant student, assiduously applied yourself to the 
slogans and parables of Maoism, and were anxious to shine, you would. "I was 
raised on the teachings of Mao and on the operas of Madam Mao, Comrade Jiang 
Ching," Min writes at the start of her memoir. 
</P>
<P>
 Opera -- Jiang Ching's were ideological epics -- is the key to Min's memory of 
growing up, as well as to the distinctive style and tone of her book. "We were 
sure that we were making red dots on the world's map," she writes in a phrase 
comically reminiscent of George Bush's points of light. "Not for a day did I 
not feel heroic. I was the opera." Her part was to be a little Red Guard and a 
polished apple to her political teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 As with operatic arias, the important thing was to sing well. Then Min 
discovered that the arias contained real words and that words could kill. Her 
most-loved teacher -- she recited classical poetry and demonstrated the meaning 
of infinity by holding out her arms, cross-like -- was denounced as a spy. Min 
was named to take part in the public denunciation. Her description of the 
persuasion and pressures put on a 13-year-old girl is agonizing. When the 
teacher is kicked and abused, refuses to confess and gently questions Min, the 
distraught child screams: "Mama, Papa, where are you?" A moment later, 
hysterical, she shrieks out her assigned accusation. Years afterward, she 
apologizes to the old woman, who denies remembering her. 
</P>
<P>
 Min's book is in three parts. The first, brief and stunning, tells of her life 
until she is 17. The second, written more roughly but with great effect, 
describes her arduous assignment to work on a collective farm on the southeast 
coast. In the third, she is taken from the farm to compete as one of five 
finalists for a film role tailored to fit new ideological lines set out by 
Jiang Ching. Mao's wife, herself a former actress, was at the head of a 
hard-line faction jockeying for power, and the film was to be one of her 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, Min lets her writing puff up into the operatic style that serves as her 
image of China in the '70s. The book's last part is by far its weakest. At the 
film school, Min is soon relegated to menial chores by officials who favor 
another candidate. Sitting in a dark stairwell after mopping the stage, she is 
approached by a sinuously beautiful man who comforts her and gives her egg 
rolls. He turns out to be a supremely powerful figure -- known only as the 
Supervisor -- who is Jiang Ching's right-hand man for the arts, and perhaps her 
lover. 
</P>
<P>
 He treats Min with alternating tenderness and coldness, makes love to her, has 
her brought to his magnificent mansion in Peking and gives her the coveted role 
of Red Azalea in a film that is intended to represent Jiang Ching's life. 
However, Mao dies, Jiang Ching and the Supervisor fall, and Min is back to 
mopping floors. The book ends there; years later she will emigrate to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Presumably the story is true but the telling is garishly unconvincing, an 
uneasy mix of "Cinderella" and "The Story of O." "Pleasure swept over our 
flesh," Min writes steamily. The Supervisor stares into her eyes and demands to 
see in them "1,000,000 bulls rushing downhill with their tails on fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Min has written the book in English, and even in the first two parts the style 
can be awkward. Mostly she writes long strings of short declarative sentences 
-- a rhythm, perhaps, brought over from Chinese -- and this produces a 
cumulative small hammering. Yet time and again she makes a stranger's 
discovery, a glowing image or phrase that no native English-speaker would think 
of. 
</P>
<P>
 Such phrases light up the strangely affecting world of the Red Fire Farm, 
where 200,000 workers brought from the cities work 16-hour days, undergo 
constant haranguing by the cadres and sleep packed together in earth-floored 
huts, their only privacy the space under their mosquito netting: "a grave with 
a little spoiled air." 
</P>
<P>
 Min conveys the hardship and claustrophobia, but also the passions. She charts 
the unpredictable workings of exhilaration, exhaustion and despair. There is a 
splendid portrait of Yan, the section leader: big, fierce and vulnerable. Min 
and she become lovers; later Yan timidly confesses her liking for a male cadre, 
and Min helps her write steamy love-letters that end up arousing them both. 
There is the fanatical, humorless Lu who covets Yan's job, yet Min writes of 
her in a way that captures our understanding if not sympathy. Through the 
horror of Maoism she is able to suggest the awful previous hopelessness that 
made so many Chinese welcome and administer it. She can give fanaticism a human 
face, which is not the same as embellishing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her unworkable final section, Min's is a distinct and moving voice 
speaking out of a caldron of history. When, full of zeal, she goes to cancel 
her Shanghai residency prior to being trucked off to the farm, she has a 
premonition of the chill abstraction that lies beyond the fervor: "That 
afternoon I felt like a bare egg laid on a rock." Her family come down to see 
her off; she sits in the truck with the other conscripts. The cadres organize a 
sing-along, trying for exultation. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family stood in front of me, as if taking a dull picture," Min writes. "It 
was a picture of sadness, a picture of never the same. I was out of the 
picture. . . . We began to sing with Lu. Our voices were dry and weak like old 
sick farm cows. Lu waved her arms hard, trying to speed up the singing. People 
paid no attention to her. It was a moment when memory takes root. The moment 
youth began to fade. I stared at my parents who stood like frosted eggplants -- 
with heads hanging weakly in front of their chests. My tears welled up. I sang 
loudly."

THE VIRGULA, DIPLE AND PUNCTUM; PAUSE AND EFFECT: AN INTRODUCTION TO THE 
HISTORY OF THE PUNCTUATION IN THE WEST, BY M.B. PARKES (UNIVERSITY OF 
CALIFORNIA PRESS: $55; 343 PP. WITH 74 BLACK-AND-WHITE PLATES)

<TEXT>
<P>
 Marks of punctuation, those friendly but firm little sentinels and traffic 
signs on the information byways of the printed page, are not something we 
ordinarily give much notice to. Subliminally inflecting our understanding, they 
seem as much a part of our language as the alphabet itself. M. B. Parkes, 
Fellow of Keble College, Oxford, has written a fascinating, wide-ranging and 
immensely learned book exploring the development and usages of these minute 
signals from ancient times up to the 20th Century. The concentration is on 
medieval manuscripts, as this is both Parkes' specialty and represents the 
period of punctuation's greatest development. 
</P>
<P>
 The preponderance of ancient texts were written down in scripto continuo -- 
without separations between words or indications of pauses. These texts were 
not read in the sense we understand the word but were analyzed for proper 
rhetorical phrasing, much in the way play scripts or musical scores are used 
today by performers. What few antique marks of punctuation as did arise were 
not supplied by authors but by teachers for the instruction of students and 
inexperienced orators. The magisterial speaker Cicero scorned such devices, 
insisting that the end of a sentence should be clear not from "a stroke 
interposed by a copyist but by the constraint of the rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Middle Ages, writing gradually came to be seen as not simply the record 
of the spoken word but as a medium of thought and discourse in its own right. 
The 6th-Century bishop Isadore of Seville was the first to remark on the 
advantages of silent reading; requiring less physical involvement, it 
encouraged retention and reflection. 
</P>
<P>
 With the passing of classical learning and rhetoric, and the rise of scribal 
copying of Latin texts in the monasteries for the transmission of Christian 
doctrine and exegesis, there grew a need for a system of interpretive notation. 
Numerous versions of these were developed in different centers of learning, not 
only to assist monks in their silent reading and transcription in a language 
they were not always masters of, but also to ensure canonical (and discourage 
heretical) interpretations of the Scriptures. 
</P>
<P>
 The littera notabilior, or "noticeable letter," was the precursor to our 
capitals. The punctum, or "point," was employed singly and multiply in various 
positions to indicate different sorts of grammatical pauses, as was the 
virgula, which looked like the modern slash mark. The diple, a kind of 
wedge-shaped pointer, was first used to highlight quotations from the Bible and 
ultimately became the basis for our quotation marks. 
</P>
<P>
 Irish monks made an especially significant contribution to the development of 
Western punctuation. Since their own language was quite different from the 
Romance ones, they were particularly enabled to perceive written Latin as a 
visual language. Page decoration and layout as well as variant calligraphic 
forms were combined with punctuation devices to produce complex layers of 
meaning, interpretation and textual hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 As the demand for book copying increased and became secularized in the later 
Middle Ages, the scriptural traditions of punctuation were diffused. With the 
establishment of type foundries and the advent of printing, the punctuation 
repertoire was simplified and its usage increasingly codified. Several useful 
distinctions did not survive, such as that between the earnest punctus 
interrogativus, signaling a question requiring an answer and the punctus 
percontativus, denoting its brasher rhetorical sibling. 
</P>
<P>
 The last sections of "Pause and Effect" follow the story up through the modern 
era, with examples of printed prose and poetry by Thomas Nashe, Jonathan Swift, 
Jane Austen, Robert Browning, Charlotte Bronte, Virginia Woolf and others. By 
this time punctuation had become far more strategic than simply 
interpretational. This was due in part to the strong dichotomy that had emerged 
in secular writing between content and form, or, alternatively, between the 
underlying logic of what was said and the rhetorical devices used to express it 
convincingly, a division that could never have been made regarding scriptural 
texts. 
</P>
<P>
 The author's chapter "The Layout and Punctuation of Verse" and his brief 
assessment of punctuation emendations made by modern editors open up new topics 
for consideration and are well worth reading by anyone involved in literary 
studies. Alongside the 74 full-page plates giving manuscript and printed 
illustrations of Parkes' examples are full transcriptions, translations and 
annotations, making these a useful learning tool for the curious 
non-specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 The foregoing account is only a rather breathless precis of the material 
covered. Parkes has produced a densely informative synthesis that is not simply 
about, as the subtitle has it, the history of punctuation in the West. In his 
analysis of the subtle grammatical and rhetorical distinctions developed 
through the interpretation and creation of all sorts of texts he has begun to 
examine some of the deeper properties and purposes of language itself.

COVER STORY: A TALE OF TWO CULTURES; AN ACTOR-PRODUCER'S PERSPECTIVE DURING 
BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM REID, Actor-producer Tim Reid has appeared as a regular in the TV series 
WKRP in Cincinnati, Simon & Simon, Frank's Place (of which he was co-executive 
producer), Snoops (which he also co-created and executive-produced) and was 
executive producer of the current BET and Family Channel film Race to Freedom: 
The Underground Railroad. His new series, Sister, Sister, begins this spring on 
ABC. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My wife, Daphne Maxwell Reid, agreed to attend the gala award ceremony only if 
I promised not to get grumpy and start bemoaning the fact that few blacks would 
be involved in the event either as nominees or presenters. "After all," she 
said, "this is cable and not everyone can get BET." She shoved some antacid 
tablets in her cute little gold purse and pushed me toward the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Sinbad, who co-hosted, the event began on an upbeat note. In all, 
only five blacks would come to the stage the entire evening. Daphne kept her 
hand near her purse ready to whip out an antacid in case she noticed the 
slightest change in my disposition. 
</P>
<P>
 They had just given an award to a cable system for its efforts to preserve 
films and old TV programs. As I watched a clip of some of the films chosen to 
be preserved, my mood began to sour. I whispered, "You'd think they would have 
tried to save at least one of Oscar Micheaux's films. Hell, he made over 40." 
She handed me an antacid. 
</P>
<P>
 The presenter continued to exalt the cause, "Movies reflect what we are, who 
we are ... they are a diary of American culture." I leaned over to my wife and 
said, "He's right and black folks are in deep trouble because little of what we 
are will make the cut." Daphne dumped the rest of the antacids in my lap. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, for some strange reason that would need a few hours' couch time 
to explain, I began to think of Charles Dickens. His words began to materialize 
in my mind. "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the 
age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness ... " 
</P>
<P>
 In his fable, "A Tale of Two Cities," he revealed an atmosphere where the 
status quo and the viewpoint of the ruling class were generally accepted as 
eternal truth. Why I could remember this now and not years ago when I was in 
English lit is, as I said, a job for professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 I popped another antacid and let my mind drift deeper. Here we are, I thought, 
about to crash headlong into the 21st Century, and the distorted views of the 
dominant culture are accepted as eternal truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is this more evident than with the accepted images of black folks as 
they are portrayed by the media. Rarely do I see anything remotely familiar to 
the richness and diversity that I knew as a child growing up in the all-black 
community in Norfolk, Va. In this energized environment, everything around me 
was black-owned or managed. That included our own newspaper, our own cab 
company, our own mom-and-pop grocery stores, our own savings and loan and six 
of our own movie theaters. Yes, segregation had forced us to cope, and that we 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the '60s Model Cities urban renewal program, it's all gone now. They 
seemed to start with the black businesses first, and then the black-owned 
homes. However, they did manage to leave every low-income housing project that 
surrounded our community intact. Save those buildings, there is not one brick 
left standing in what was once known around the world as "Little New York." 
</P>
<P>
 The same thing happened in Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis, Philadelphia, etc. In 
their places, the great Model Cities took the shape of Chicago's Cabrini 
Green-type structures and, well, you know the rest. Under the guise of "saving" 
us, they destroyed the base of what we worked so hard to have: 
self-sufficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 Where is the visual legacy that reflects the lifestyle and the best of who we 
were as we toiled under the weight of segregation? During the '60s, if it 
weren't for Bill Cosby and "I Spy" and Diahann Carroll's "Julia," the only 
other black faces I would have seen were carrying picket signs and being chased 
by bigots and police dogs, hardly an entertaining evening of TV viewing, unless 
of course, you were a bigot. 
</P>
<P>
 Things became a little more colorful, so to speak, when Flip Wilson took 
center stage and the nation was charmed by what the devil made him do. "Good 
Times," despite the writers' focus on one character, broke ground in exploring 
urban living. For a brief moment, there was optimism that blacks would have a 
stake in telling their story. It was an illusion. 
</P>
<P>
 We all had hoped that the '70s would give us an opportunity to create new 
concepts and explore broader views of who our people were. However, although we 
were seen on the screen in larger numbers than ever before, behind the cameras 
the view would cause you to go snowblind. Things had not changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Few of us emerged with even the most meager production commitment to develop 
the next wave of black programming. For those who have broken through, there is 
little room for missed opportunity. If a series created by us doesn't hit the 
ground running, you had better be wearing a chute, because out the door you go. 
We seldom pogo from one series to another. For instance, why haven't we seen 
the names Steve Duncan and L. Travis Clark reappear in TV credits? After all, 
didn't the series co-created by them -- "Tour of Duty" -- provide some of TV's 
finest hours? 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the denials of most people who control the creative strings, 
everything that finds its way onto our TV, or movie screen, is, quite simply, 
propaganda. Good or bad, fact or fiction, millions of people around the world 
now formulate their general opinions about people, places and things based on 
what is created by a few select individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Others can debate the problems with -- or the merits of -- such a system, but 
personally I want in. Call me pushy, but I want a say as to how the culture of 
my people is viewed around the the world. You've had your fun, but I'm afraid 
it's time to loosen up on the reins a little because your view of us has 
stepped way over the line. 
</P>
<P>
 I know many of you can converse in the latest lingo and you probably attend 
all the Laker games, but the stuff you develop and present as a depiction of 
life in black America pales in comparison to the real story. There are a 
million stories in the "Naked City" and the powerful saga of "Roots" was just 
one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Dickens, I acknowledge that, in many ways, and for many black folks in 
the limelight, these are the best of times. I proudly sit in darkened theaters 
and watch Denzel, Wesley, Laurence and Whoopi play roles that traditionally 
would have gone to white actors. 
</P>
<P>
 In television there have been sparks of renewed hope. The attempt to redefine 
the black sitcom formula is still a goal for some. "Frank's Place," if I may be 
so bold as to say, had a brief streak of uniqueness and it owes its opportunity 
to the success of "The Cosby Show." It's ironic that while some of our most 
successful actors break racial barriers, few -- save Spike -- have been able to 
wield their power to bring to the screen some of the more gripping stories 
about their own people: the Buffalo Soldiers, Beckworth, the Tuskegee Airmen 
and on and on. 
</P>
<P>
 In the arena of power-brokering in the entertainment industry, these are 
indeed the worst of times. It's a sad commentary that in a business known for 
its liberalism there is not one black person who can "green light" a single 
project via the major venues of TV networks or studios. Not one black person 
has come within fainting distance of true power in a town where power is the 
Holy Grail. There is not one person of color who can get a project made in this 
town without the customarily assigned overseer. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the age of wisdom and there are a number of black folk who have been 
"trodding on the wine press much too long." It is time to share power with 
those who have earned the opportunity. How much more would a studio or network 
be with a talent as experienced as Suzanne de Passe at the helm? 
</P>
<P>
 What would black sitcoms be like if one of the fully qualified black network 
execs, who have been kept at a safe distance from any real control, actually 
had the opportunity to act on their gut instinct? I know for a fact that the 
story and production of "Race to Freedom: The Underground Railroad" was 
enriched because of the talents of many black folks who ordinarily don't have a 
voice at every stage of a project's genesis. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time to prepare for the kind of environment that will carry over into the 
new millennium. I'm certainly not the only one who knows that the old ways have 
lost their effectiveness. The excuses for the lack of change no longer make any 
sense and now appear rude and mean-spirited. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the age of foolishness and the power elite of the entertainment industry 
needs to be more inclusive. What folly it is to believe that the true culture 
of a people can be told without the involvement of those very people at all 
stages of development. 
</P>
<P>
 How absurd to think that the sum total of millions of people can be trotted 
out each February and ignored the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 It often pains me as I watch the images of a people who have given so much 
become reduced to and categorized by the constant stream of flickering TV news 
bites of black men in handcuffs ... or the crude sights and sounds of 
misogynous rap videos ... or a vulgar joke by modern-day minstrels. Like any 
other culture or race, these images are examples of a few who have lost hope 
... those who will degrade their own for 30 pieces of silver ... those who 
would embrace caricature over character. 
</P>
<P>
 The true nature of my people can be defined by the fact that we are still 
here. We survived the "Black Holocaust," which the dominant culture refers to 
as "slavery." By whatever name, it was a horrific tragedy that saw more than 
100 million of my ancestors taken in chains from their homeland with close to 
50 million of them lost at sea during the Middle Passage. Brought to the 
Americas, they suffered under the most evil and inhumane conditions that lasted 
for more than 200 years. In spite of this, we've made and are still making 
historic contributions that benefit all of mankind. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout this (short) month, as we celebrate the heritage of my people, know 
that we are aware that the struggle continues. The rules have changed and the 
new battle will be fought in the lanes of the information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 Come on, keepers of the diary of American culture, it's time to consider the 
entire truth. The worst that could happen is that you might learn of the 
richness of my culture, whose depth is more than you have imagined. I know that 
this will challenge the view of us that is now portrayed by the dominant 
culture because I, too, have been watching superficial images peddled as 
eternal truths. 
</P>
<P>
 I would continue but I'm all out of antacids.

ROMULUS FIGHTS THE POWER; THE CAVEMAN'S VALENTINE, BY GEORGE DAWES GREEN 
(WARNER BOOKS: $19.95; 323 PP.)

<P>
 Mental illness is tricky. I have a manic-depressive friend who, while in a 
manic phase, passionately dug up two rows of shrubbery outside her apartment 
complex. The idea was to plant a community-based vegetable garden. "People 
should have a deeper investment in their surroundings," she explained to the 
irate landlord. "We can all share real-life vegetables." 
</P>
<P>
 The landlord, however, didn't want real-life vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 Although my friend's actions were destructive and illegal, many people would 
see them as immensely satisfying, even heroic, in a 
one-woman-stands-against-the-machine kind of way. It can be difficult to resist 
romanticizing certain types of mental illness, particularly when the illness 
appears to give the person afflicted direct access to higher truths. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first novel, "The Caveman's Valentine," George Dawes Green sets so many 
potential traps for himself that you can almost feel the tension like coiled 
springs under every page. Not satisfied with writing a complex literary 
thriller that remains humorous while subtly attacking the excesses of our 
culture, Green dares to make his protagonist a clinically paranoid homeless 
man. 
</P>
<P>
 Romulus Ledbetter lives in a cave in New York's Inwood Park. A former pianist, 
he now eats out of trash cans, watches an unplugged TV set and fights a 
never-ending war against Stuyvesant, his omnipotent nemesis. Stuyvesant 
controls all of society with nefarious Y-Rays and Z-Rays that he shoots out 
from the Chrysler Building. "Y-Rays were for helling over a place. Y-Rays were 
for crudely hewing out the forms of backed-up toilets and tax collectors and . 
. . the grey death gathering on the faces of subway straphangers." Put very 
simply, Y-Rays cause oppression. Z-Rays are different: "this sheen on the 
Hudson . . . the smell of sex and the smell of a rich man's fields after a rain 
shower . . . a new and wickeder radiance." Z-Rays use materialism to seduce us. 
</P>
<P>
 Romulus fights the powerful rays with his angels. "Romulus could feel them now 
-- they were astir inside his skull. The Seraphs of Divinity and Vengeance. He 
felt them fluttering their little wings like moths against the soft walls of 
his brain. He felt their fury rising." The wonderful and tragic thing about 
Romulus is that, like my bush-pulling manic depressive friend, he is 
unbalanced; but he is also right. 
</P>
<P>
 Things might have continued pretty much the same in Romulus' life if it 
weren't for the frozen body he discovers outside his cave early one February 
morning: a homeless man named Scotty Gates. The police believe he died of 
natural causes. Romulus disagrees. Not only did he clearly see the murderer on 
his private television set, but Matthew Donofrio, a homeless man who was 
Scotty's lover, tells Romulus that before he died, Scotty had been tortured for 
months by a well-known painter. There was a videotape and blackmail. Matthew is 
convinced the painter murdered Scotty, but Romulus knows who is really behind 
all of it: Stuyvesant, the man at the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Guided by his sense of morality to find Scotty's killer, Romulus is forced to 
reconnect with mainstream society. This isn't easy for someone who has a brain 
full of angels, wears a saucepan lined with squirrel fur on his head and is 
prone to uncontrollable fits of rage. Here's Romulus working a VCR: "Using his 
dim memory of the Bible for his instruction manual, he decided that Power was 
surely the prime mover, the essential beginning of things. He pushed. The 
machine sprang to attention. He fed it the tape, which it devoured. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now what? Why, we're all the frolicking children of Eden, what else should we 
do but Play?" 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part "The Caveman's Valentine" is nothing short of brilliant. 
Romulus' character is so compelling that many readers will want to tear him 
from the page just to offer him a home-cooked dinner -- no small feat, 
considering the man stinks and will shout obscenities without warning. Even 
more unusual is Green's ability to remain scrupulously honest. Untrapped. Until 
the last 50 pages there is nothing glorified, polemical or cute about Romulus 
and the life he's chosen. One example of this is a scene in North Carolina 
where Romulus, who is black, removes a Confederate flag from a motel lobby wall 
and sneaks it into the bottom of the racist proprietor's bird cage. 
</P>
<P>
 Confronted with a scene like this, many authors would slow way down and 
possibly mention it again later -- just to be sure we all understand that Big 
Issues are at play here. Instead, Green gives us a quick, funny throw-away that 
renders the section twice as effective. His presence as a writer is invisible. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately there are some problems in the book. Toward the end, many 
characters change radically but with no clear provocation. One man goes from 
being a sarcastic jerk to a completely decent person in a very short span of 
time, while another metamorphoses into a towering, two-dimensional villain with 
no power or complexity. That would be fine in a lesser novel, but "The 
Caveman's Valentine" is too smart for its standard thriller ending. Even 
Romulus changes. Perhaps an expert on clinical paranoia would disagree, but it 
strains credibility to think anyone who spends his time dodging greenish Z-Rays 
could truly move forward without considerable help. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of its flaws, though, "The Caveman's Valentine" is a great read. 
Character, plot and style are braided so beautifully together that the whole 
book shines with its own wild light. The light of good writing. Or, as Romulus 
would say, "Divinity."

 THE LIVES OF BERYL MARKHAM by Errol Trzebinski (Norton: $27.50; 416 pp.) Soon 
to be a major motion picture: not Errol Trzebinski's book, but Beryl Markham's 
book, "West With the Night" -- which Markham didn't write, according to 
Trzebinski.He contends that Markham's book was ghosted by then-husband Raoul 
Schumacher, a ghostwriter by trade. The remarkable Markham could do a lot of 
things -- train champion horses, fly solo across the Atlantic the hard way in 
1936, roam the African bush alone, seduce (Lord, could she seduce!) -- but she 
couldn't write. Neither can Trzebinski, at least not terribly well. In a 
herky-jerky biography sloppily written, crammed with people only the Kenya 
colony would know (except Karen Blixen/Isak Dinesen and Denys Finch Hatton) and 
speckled with random commas, Trzebinski attempts to get a grip on Markham. 
Others have tried, and failed, and Trzebinski admittedly does better than most 
and gets points for even trying. 
</P>
<P>
 Markham was one of the most inscrutable women of our time. Raised with benign 
neglect by a father too busy for hugs (mother long since split; spooked by 
Africa), Markham spent her youth with -- almost in -- the local tribe. 
Transplanted to Nairobi's European colony in her teens, she was indeed of two 
worlds: surpassingly stoic, as the Africans are; rude, as they are not; 
unlettered, self-centered, independent, physically powerful and by all accounts 
a major beauty. Along with countless sexual conquests (from the Duke of Windsor 
to her buddies in the bush), she stalked Finch Hatton, the last Great White 
Hunter, winning him from Dinesen (whom Trzebinski describes as dumpy and 
possessive). Legendary lover, legendary libber, legendary flier -- as written, 
by somebody , in "West With the Night." Catch the movie.

 BAREBACK! One Man's Journey Across the Pony Express Trail by Jerry Ellis 
(Delacorte: $21.95; 307 pp.) It would be heartless to knock "Bareback!" -- 
author Jerry Ellis is so vulnerable, so ingenuous; at 42, the last innocent 
American.Heartless, but not impossible. Start with the title. Would you believe 
"Clothedback!"? In tracing the storied Pony Express mail route of 1860-61 from 
St. Joseph, Mo., to San Francisco, Ellis gets on a horse approximately once (it 
runs away with him). Otherwise, he walks, hitchhikes (!), canoes. None of which 
the Pony guys did, but what the hey. Oh, he also joins a hokey "wagon train" 
for a short spell, peeling off when nobody will speak to him. He tells us, 
often, that he has broken up with his girlfriend, and even more often how he 
misses his parents ("How comforting it is to me to envision my mother and know 
that she is alive and well.") Throughout, he feels very alone -- or, in his 
words, "I feel very alone." 
</P>
<P>
 In prose pedestrian enough to raise corns, Ellis records every thought 
("Life's too short to throw love out the window"; "I may get a Milky Way the 
next time I find a grocery store"); every conversation ("Is Mike in? Just a 
minute. Hello, says Mike. Mike, it's Jerry. Oh, he says." Not that Ellis' 
travels are lacking in incident. On seeing a bull in Nevada, he confides that 
"adrenaline jars my system to rush fear to every muscle." In Berkeley, 
moreover, "I find myself facing a man with a beard and a bottle in a bag." Now 
there's a sight!

 FRIDAYS WITH RED: A Radio Friendship by Bob Edwards (Simon & Schuster: $21; 
240 pp.) In his latter years, you still would have had to get up pretty early 
in the morning to put one over on Red Barber -- 7:35 a.m., to be exact; 
Fridays. Even at that hour it was hard to ruffle the self-styled Ol' Redhead. 
Prickly, opinionated, benign, altogether delightful, Barber held forth for four 
minutes a week on National Public Radio's "Morning Edition," the program's most 
popular spot from 1981 until his death in 1992, at 84. Six hundred spots there 
were; 600 opinions. He talked about whatever he felt like: the weather in 
Tallahassee; cats and camellias; Euripides and Ethel Merman and "Cosi Fan 
Tutte"; his two favorite books (Winston Churchill's "History of the 
English-Speaking Peoples" and the Episcopalians' "Book of Common Prayer") . . . 
Say what? asks the late riser; surely you're not talking about the Red Barber, 
our Red Barber? Indeed: beloved broadcaster of the Dodgers, in a day when you 
could walk the breadth of Brooklyn and never miss a pitch, so ubiquitous were 
the tuned-in radios; the man who stamped into Webster's "the catbird seat" and 
the "rhubarb"; the man for whom an elusive baseball was "slicker than oiled 
okra," whose reaction to a spectacular play was "I'll be a suck-egg mule!" 
</P>
<P>
 We might have known there was more to Red Barber when he commented on an 
error-prone infielder, "Like the Ancient Mariner he stoppeth one of three." NPR 
knew, and wisely gave Red his head. Bob Edwards, "Morning Edition" host who 
jump-started Barber for 12 years, does not intend a biography here, just a 
tribute, a Festschrift . His is a pleasant book, unremarkable, though on the 
flint of Barber's perfectionism, we catch a glint of his professionalism. Vin 
Scully, one of Barber's young proteges, says it best: "He cared."

 WITH EXTREME PREJUDICE by Fredrick Barton (Villard: $20; 384 pp.) Rare is the 
mystery novel whose ending genuinely surprises. This one surprises.Even shocks. 
If you stick it out to the end, you're in for a treat. Big if . For "With 
Extreme Prejudice" can't make up its mind what it is. Sometimes it's a treatise 
-- albeit an enlightened one -- on racism. Sometimes it's a movie review. 
Sometimes it's a letter to the Penthouse Forum. When it gets down to business, 
though, Fredrick Barton's book is a superior, savvy tangle of greed, graft and 
sudden violence, with a pervasive subtext of the struggle between unconscious 
bias and better instincts. Barton's stage is New Orleans -- the Big Easy, a 
city drifting into dysfunction stemming from white flight and black power. His 
plot -- needlessly complicated -- revolves around a three-faced white 
wheeler-dealer cheating a black builder out of a contract to erect a school. 
The builder sues, represented by the lawyer wife of protagonist Mike Barnett. A 
hitherto upright, even heroic liberal judge rules against the builder. The fix 
is in, but whose, and why? The builder dies; the lawyer dies. Widower Barnett 
pursues the case, and winds up the suspect in three murders. While not 
sleuthing, drinking or graphically recalling sex with his wife, Barnett writes 
movie reviews for the local paper. How do we know? Because six of them are 
printed here. Don't ask me why. Maybe it's because author Barton is also a film 
critic. And a pretty fair novelist.

 SIXTY-NINE by Ryu Murakami, translated from the Japanese by Ralph F. McCarthy 
(Kodansha: $20; 192 pp.) Peace has nothing to do with it.Revolution is just a 
ruse. When Kensuke Yazaki and his buddies barricade their high school in 
Sasebo, Japan, and spray-paint radical slogans thereon, it's for a far nobler 
cause: girls. It's 1969 -- hence the title -- but in feel and fabric, woof and 
tweet, it could be America two decades earlier. Students are equally stifled, 
hormonally hopped-up. Virgins at 17, God love 'em. All sorts of questions and 
no answers from parents and teachers who tell them to sit down and shut up. 
</P>
<P>
 Author Ryu Murakami -- a deserved prize-winner in Japan -- has got to be a 
disciple of J. D. Salinger; Kensuke his Holden Caulfield. "The problem with 
people from coal-mining towns," says Ken, "is that they're too serious about 
everything. Maybe it has to do with the explosions and cave-ins and whatnot." 
Pure Holden. The Catcher in the Rice. Anyway, Ken, a thoroughly engaging 
semi-smartass, will do anything to impress Kazuko (Lady Jane) Matsui, anything. 
Listen to Simon and Garfunkel. Quote Rimbaud. Drink tomato juice (it's cool, 
it's hip, it's American). Foment an uprising. You know the guys' hearts aren't 
in it when you read the slogans: "Reject Pre-established Harmony"; "Beneath the 
Pavement Lies a Desert." One of Ken's pals, no genius, mistakes a Japanese 
character; "To Arms" comes out "To Exams."

 IF WISHES WERE HORSES . . . by Francine Pascal (Crown: $20; 272 pp.) If you've 
ever studied a foreign language, you know there's a transcendent moment when 
you stop struggling, stop translating in your head, and eureka! you're speaking 
it.Anna Devlin feels it twice, once when she gets a grip on French, and once 
more, far more important, when she stops translating from Pity, Loneliness and 
Bereavement and begins to speak Life without a flaw. Husband Nick -- boyish, 
enthusiastic, a talented journalist -- has died of cancer, much too young. 
Anna, devastated, has tried to put it all behind her, buying a house in the 
south of France. It doesn't work. In spite of her bravest efforts to meet new 
people, immerse herself in a new milieu, she remains dangerously introspective. 
</P>
<P>
 Francine Pascal (author of the Sweet Valley High series for teens; this is her 
second adult novel) bounces flashbacks off Anna's bowed head to evoke her love 
story. Nick, nondescript but hellbent, had snatched Anna from her fiance, the 
standard stuffed shirt, literally at the last minute. In the present, Pascal 
does widowhood beautifully -- the self-imposed alienation, the noxious inertia 
-- but spares us relentless tragedy by deft touches of humor and humanity: Anna 
trying to bury two pounds of Nick's ashes under a favorite Central Park bench; 
looking for a vibrator and settling for a zucchini; grandly ordering from a 
menu Helene Leger , which turns out to be the name of the chef. She never 
really breaks, Anna, and when she comes up, we come up with her.

MORE EPISODES OF 'HOMICIDE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in ages, there was something truly engrossing and 
entertaining on Thursday evenings for viewers with an IQ quotient above the 
wattage of a small appliance bulb -- "Homicide: Life on the Street" (NBC). 
Instead of following the cliches of typical cop shows, this superb program with 
its incredible cast took on the exploration of the whys found in the human 
mind.If the powers at NBC don't give this series longer than four episodes, 
they have bricks where their brains should be. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathryn Caro, San Diego Kid Shows, Adult Commercials 
</P>
<P>
 How wonderful to find family entertainment promoted. My kids and I looked 
forward to an hour together watching "Treasure Island: The Story Begins (Jan. 
23, NBC). It should have been noted in TV Times that anyone watching with 
children should turn off the commercials. Coca-Cola gives us its first 
commercial with continuing lyrics, "I just want to make love to you." Next came 
glaring super-graphics, designed for any first-grade reader, "DATE RAPE," 
followed by provocative sound bites plugging Sally Jessy Raphael. Now how do 
you explain this stuff to a 3- or 6-year-old? 
</P>
<P>
 Susan B. Winston, North Hollywood Gunned Down 
</P>
<P>
 Your cover choice for the Jan. 30-Feb. 5 TV Times left much to be desired. The 
last thing I would like to see on my television guide is Bill Cosby and co-star 
brandishing 9mm-semiautomatic weapons. I see enough guns and violence on the 
television already. I don't need it on my coffee table.

 CHARLES M. RUSSELL, WORD PAINTER: Letters 1887-1926 edited by Brian W. Dippie 
(Abrams/Amon Carter Museum: $95; 435 pp.) Charles Russell (1864-1926) is the 
patron saint of letter writers and designers; Nick Bantock's (and therefore 
Griffin & Sabine's) spiritual grandfather."To have talent," the painter, 
sculptor, illustrator and storyteller wrote in 1925, "is no credut to its owner 
for what man cant help he shuld get nether credut nor blame its not his falt." 
From the age of 16, Russell worked as a night wrangler on cattle roundups. Days 
were spent painting the people and animals of the West, primarily Montana. But 
the life of the cow puncher, like the trapper before him, was on the wane by 
1893, and "Kid Russell" took up art full-time. Between a one-man show in New 
York in 1911, a full-page story in the New York Times, and a commission for a 
mural in Montana's State Capitol, Russell's fame was cinched. This collection 
of what Russell called his "paper talk," illustrated letters, inscriptions and 
greetings, is complemented by photos of the author and his family. Flipping 
through these pages gives one new ideas -- for colors, journals, handwriting, 
trips to take, and friends to write to. Susan Reynolds

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; '112TH AND CENTRAL': A VIEW OF THE 
RIOTS FROM AND BY YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In all of the film footage and broadcasts that followed the 1992 Los Angeles 
riots, there is one project about what happened that sets itself apart by its 
perspective and production. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the same youths we see being interviewed in 112th and Central, a 
documentary that opened at the Vista in Los Feliz last year and airs on KCET 
this week, are co-producers of the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a month after the disturbances, touched off by the verdicts in the 
cases of the officers charged with beating Rodney King, a group of professional 
filmmakers and actors linked up with 25 black and Hispanic students between the 
ages of 9 and 21. They were participants in a L.A. Cities in School program 
based at 112th Street and Central Avenue in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths were given video cameras and, assisted by filmmakers Jim Chambers 
and Hal Hisey and actors Vondie Curtis-Hall, Darnell Williams, Kasi Lemmons, 
Virginia Madsen and others, they taped what they saw and knew. They focused on 
not only the kids' reactions to the riots but also on their family, friends, 
the police and the gang truce between the Crips and the Bloods. 
</P>
<P>
 The young filmmakers were told "to shoot footage of what you feel would tell 
your best part of the film," says director Chambers, who says he was amazed by 
the youths' thirst to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was astonished at how brilliant and how hopeful and how hungry and how 
curious and how needy they were," he says from New York, where he is editing a 
new film. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers may be surprised by the revelations made possible when these kids 
speak directly to the camera without the sound-bite quality of the evening 
news. 
</P>
<P>
 There's Cleophas Jackson, a grade-schooler with a microphone who interviews 
his classmates with the ease of a seasoned moderator. In his review last year, 
The Times' Peter Rainer writes, "In the end, when he talks about how he wants 
to become attorney general when he grows up, you can't think of a finer 
candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 "112th and Central" attempts to give the gangs a human face along with showing 
the riots from a kid's viewpoint. Kartoon, an ex-gang member, recites his rap 
poetry and describes his feelings right after the riots. Dewayne Holmes talks 
about why he organized the Crips-Blood truce. 
</P>
<P>
 During the riots, Chambers says, "There were so many news crews that showed up 
to grab some fast footage and a quick quote and dash off, that at first (the 
youths) thought we were a news crew who would do the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "One complaint they had was that their community is only portrayed in garish 
crises: drive-by shoot-ups, fires, death and not much else about the life and 
vibrancy and the hope and the spirits who live there," the director says. 
</P>
<P>
 Filming "112th and Central" took six months and another six months was spent 
in post-production. 
</P>
<P>
 "112th and Central" airs Friday at 11 p.m. on KCET. For ages 10 and up. 
Another Family Show 
</P>
<P>
 The Animaniacs take a romp through American history in a special President's 
Day episode of Steven Spielberg Presents Animaniacs (Monday 4-4:30 p.m. Fox). 
In the tradition of the popular "Wakko's World," Wakko is challenged to recite 
all 50 states and their capitals to music in "Wakko's America." The Warners 
help Abe Lincoln write the Gettysburg Address in "Four Score and Seven 
Migraines Ago." In "The Flame," the tip of a candle comes to life and plays an 
important part in the birth of America. For ages 2 to 8.

COMMENTARY; SO NEAR, YET SO REMOTE

By JUDITH LAZARUS, Judith Lazarus is a free-lance writer based in Southern 
California.

<TEXT>
<P>
 No matter his age or what shape he's in, every guy in Southern California is a 
surfer dude -- a channel surfer. By now everyone has discussed the clicker and 
the testosterone connection ad nauseum, but still the war rages on. 
</P>
<P>
 Come to think of it, it's a rarely discussed facet of television violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Face it, the female rarely wins the battle over the remote control; the male 
is usually bigger and almost always stronger. Then there's that fierce hormonal 
instinct to protect his territory. 
</P>
<P>
 My husband will actually go to sleep on top of the clicker to avoid a telltale 
snore signaling a chance at any sneak recovery. When I'm in a feisty 
independent mood, he's even been known to carry it with him into the bathroom 
-- possession being nine-tenths of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm always torn between wanting him to relax and enjoy or feeling as if my 
personhood is being challenged. First I have these schizophrenic interior 
conversations with myself, like a discussion between Mariel Morgan and Gloria 
Steinem. Then I whip myself into a frenzy of "no fair!" and lunge in 
frustration at the innocent plastic rectangle. Wrestling and fuming for a while 
releases some of the tension, but I never end up the victor. He'll never 
understand that the issue is not even what we're watching vs. missing as much 
as the lack of psychological closure. 
</P>
<P>
 To be honest, there are some shows neither of us wants to miss. During 
"Seinfeld," "Picket Fences," "Home Improvement" and "Murphy Brown," the hanging 
10 is restricted to commercial breaks, although there are times when he's 
stayed too long on the wave and a small squabble breaks over missing "the 
important part." During the summer, he'll settle in relatively docilely for 
reruns of Mary Tyler Moore, Dick Van Dyke and Bob Newhart shows. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are nights he knows the clicker belongs to me: major awards show, 
concerts and PBS specials, New Year's Eve and "Twilight Zone" marathons. If 
he's in a feisty independent mood, he'll hang over me and make snide comments, 
but these are nights he cannot get my goat -- or my clicker. 
</P>
<P>
 If only I had that fortitude on everyday nights. Since all's supposed to be 
fair in love and war, it's only fair we women of the '90s try a new approach to 
gaining some ground here. I propose the following trade-offs as a start toward 
peaceful coexistence: 
</P>
<P>
 * Intermittent but thoughtfully timed clicking between cop and 
action-adventure shows means that next time there's a good miniseries I get the 
clicker and promise to surf channels during commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 * A prime-time hour of intermittent, sort of mindless clicking should be 
traded in on a half-hour of backrubbing (he of mine, of course). 
</P>
<P>
 * A Sunday of clicking mostly between sports channels and games, with enough 
of a peek at "Mystery!" to follow the plot is good for a video rental 
(preferably foreign) -- with no clicking. 
</P>
<P>
 * An entire weekend of constant clicking between every game and sports show 
possible calls for another video (definitely an English production). I pick it 
out, he picks it up, brings in takeout and rubs my back. 
</P>
<P>
 All bets are off if he ever falls asleep on his stomach on top of the remote 
control whileany show with sirens or shooting is on. That's when I become the 
surfer dudette forever -- or at least until he's made it up to me.

CBS TEAM AIMS TO CAPTURE THE DRAMA ON ICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIBBY SLATE, Libby Slate is a frequent contributor to TV Times who also 
writes about figure skating. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The buildup to this year's Olympic figure skating competition draws to an 
unpredictable finale this week as the medal hopefuls glide out to what is sure 
to be one of the most-watched events of the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers may think the ice would melt under the glare of the media attention, 
which began after the January attack on figure skater Nancy Kerrigan and arrest 
of rival Tonya Harding's ex-husband and bodyguard. But on Wednesday the ladies 
competition finally gets under way and ice dancing -- featuring the return of 
Great Britain's Jayne Torvill and Christpher Dean -- wraps up Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 As they did at the 1992 Games, host and play-by-play announcer Verne 
Lundquist, analyst Scott Hamilton and analyst-reporter Tracy Wilson provide 
CBS' on-air coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 No one could have foreseen this year's added drama, says David Banks, director 
of the figure skating events for CBS. But, he says, "We're objective reporters. 
I don't want the (Kerrigan-Harding) story to run away from us. Our job is not 
to go over the top, but to give it the coverage it deserves." 
</P>
<P>
 Banks rides herd over nine cameras, including a robot-controlled device 
backstage near the competitors' dressing rooms, and can also use shots from a 
worldwide feed. (It is this feed that provides most of the figure skating 
coverage by cable's TNT, which, headed by play-by-play announcer Jim Simpson 
and analyst Peter Carruthers, airs each day this week, except Monday, from 10 
a.m. to 3 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Viewers want to get to know these people," Banks says of the figure skaters 
and the network's extensive coverage. "They are artists. But there's a drive, a 
competitiveness, too. The emotions are right there in front of you, and that 
has to be compelling." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, 1984 Olympic champion Hamilton, still an active skater, says he 
believes that helps him describe the competitors. "I've skated with them, and I 
know them pretty well. I'm not looking at a piece of paper -- what I say comes 
out of my heart." 
</P>
<P>
 The CBS team is aware that viewers criticized the network's 1992 coverage, 
which broke up figure skating segments throughout each long evening. "I'm not 
defensive about it," producer David Winner says matter-of-factly. "When you do 
'The Ed Sullivan Show' and the Beatles are on, the Beatles are last. Generally, 
we have figure skating on early, and then come back later. You'd have to be 
crazy to put your 'A' material on in the first hour and then have everybody 
turn you off."

 LONG QUIET HIGHWAY by Natalie Goldberg (Bantam New Age: $10.95; 238 pp.) . The 
author of "Writing Down the Bones" traces her study of Zen Buddhism and its 
relation to writing as practice. Goldberg avoids the touchy-feely cliches that 
usually creep into American accounts of Zen training and emphasizes the need 
for self-discipline. Her pleasantly low-key journal reminds the reader that 
there is no single path to self-discovery.

 CHINA BOY by Gus Lee (Plume: $10.95; 322 pp.). Kai Ting's happy family life 
ends when his adoring mother dies, leaving the puny, spoiled boy to grow up in 
a rough district of postwar San Francisco.Kai becomes the favorite victim of 
the local bullies and his shrewish stepmother, who "missed her calling when the 
SS closed its ranks to all comers after the demise of Hitler." As he learns 
self-defense from an assortment of colorful characters, he begins to integrate 
the Chinese and American elements of his identity in an engaging novel that 
would have benefited from some judicious pruning.

 TATTOO: The Exotic Art of Skin Decoration by Michelle Delio (St. Martin's 
Press: $14.95; 79 pp., paperback original). As Delio is the editor of Skin Art 
Magazine, it's no surprise that this breezy account of the current fad for 
tattoos has a gung-ho tone. Explanations of the various types of tattoos (e. g. 
the ones that look like barbed wire are tribal work ) are supplemented with 
photographs of people adorned with rattlesnakes, flowers, dragons and the names 
of rock bands. The text doesn't mention that an icon of pop culture may quickly 
lose its desirability: If a previous generation had gone in for similar marks, 
would they still want The Bee-Gees and Devo on their arms?

 THE QUEEN'S THROAT: Opera, Homosexuality and the Mystery of Desire by Wayne 
Koestenbaum (Vintage: $12; 271 pp., illustrated). Koestenbaum's idiosyncratic 
view of opera, gay subculture and diva worship takes the form of a series of 
apercus he deals out like hands in a bizarre game of Old Maid: "The opera queen 
is lonely because he listens to opera: opera isolates him from the sexual 
marketplace." His thesis is interesting, if moot, as he fails to distinguish 
between "opera queens" and people who listen to Callas CDs, not because they 
identify with her flamboyant on and off stage personae, but because they enjoy 
the beauties of the music. An odd choice for a National Book Award nomination.

 THE NAKED CONSUMER: How Our Private Lives Become Public Commodities by Erik 
Larson (Penguin: $10.95; 275 pp.). Posing as the CEO of a fictional direct-mail 
corporation, Larson was able to penetrate the inner workings of the companies 
that target customers for junk-mail campaigns.His account of his discoveries is 
funny, infuriating and alarming by turns. Despite the wishes of the people they 
target, these entities amass frightening amounts of personal data. Instead of 
protecting the right to privacy, the U.S. government assists and subsidizes 
their sleazy efforts: The Census Bureau even sells them data at bargain rates. 
In 1990, the Harris-Equifax poll showed 79% of Americans are "somewhat" or 
"very concerned" about threats to personal privacy; that same year, 63.7 
billion pieces of junk mail were sent -- most of it from the companies Larson 
describes.

 SALARYMAN by Meg Pei (Penguin: $11.; 296 pp.). The first half of Pei's 
ambitious novel depicts the circumscribed existence of a low-ranking Japanese 
executive.Jun Shimada begins as a minor functionary at Yamamoto Electronics: 
Like a hamster in an exercise wheel, he's content to work furiously and go 
nowhere. But when he becomes the director's personal assistant at the company's 
American headquarters, his life disintegrates -- along with Pei's writing. 
Shimada's discovery of his true self after a bout of acute alcoholism rings 
false, and the reunion with his estranged wife seems as implausible as the 
entanglements on "Melrose Place."

 HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH WORLD REPORT 1994: Events of 1993 (Human Rights Watch: $20; 
389 pp., paperback original). The organizations that issue this annual document 
-- Africa Watch, Americas Watch, Asia Watch, Helsinki Watch, Middle East Watch 
-- exist to monitor abuses around world.After analyzing conditions in 68 
countries in 1993, the authors conclude that ongoing communal violence and the 
growing conceptual challenge to human rights necessitate the appointment of a 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The discussions include 
major developments within each country, any restrictions on monitoring, the 
work of regional organizations and U.S. policy toward the country. The 
inclusion of the latter suggests that the United States has somehow become the 
sole guarantor of human rights throughout the world -- a role neither Congress 
nor the people ever voted to assume. No other industrialized country is 
subjected to comparable scrutiny of its foreign policy. The section on Japan 
ignores discrimination against people of Korean ancestry and the mistreatment 
of the aboriginal Ainu.

MENENDEZMANIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan Reynolds

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In case you were visiting another planet during the Menendez trial, or you 
watched the coverage on TV between slightly parted fingers, or you thought you 
didn't care and now you do, your friendly neighborhood book publishers and TV 
producers are going to give you a second chance. And a third. At least. 
</P>
<P>
 Publishers are tripping over each other to get their books out, and in fact, 
two are already available: "Blood Brothers" (Onyx True Crime: $4.99) by Ron 
Soble and John Johnson, the L.A. Times reporters who covered the trial; and 
"Bad Blood" (St. Martin's: $4.99) by Don Davis, author of "The Milwaukee 
Murders" and "The Nanny Murder Trial," a freelance writer and former reporter 
for the San Diego Union. "Strange Sins" by Robert Rand (who wrote on the 
killings for the Miami Herald) is scheduled at Simon & Schuster for June 
publication. Dominick Dunne, who covered the trial for Vanity Fair, has lent 
his talents to a four-hour CBS miniseries to air in May; his agent Owen Laster 
at William Morris denied rumors that Dunne was negotiating a book contract with 
Crown. 
</P>
<P>
 A screenplay by Rand was optioned then dropped by NBC, while a Fox TV movie is 
planned based on the book by Soble and Johnson, to be called "Honor Thy Father 
and Mother" and aiming to "place the audience in the position of the jury." 
</P>
<P>
 What is the appeal of a book so soon after the media blitz? "People will be 
interested to learn how this all ended up in a deadlocked jury," Johnson said. 
" 'Blood Brothers' is different from the newspaper and magazine coverage I did 
during the trial because I could include the conclusions I came to and the 
perspective I gained." 
</P>
<P>
 The contract for "Blood Brothers" was signed back in 1990. The two writers 
faxed the last chapter to the publisher on Jan. 25 -- when the Lyle Menendez 
jury looked deadlocked -- and the book was released on Feb. 7. "It was almost 
like dictating a news story on deadline," Soble said. "In a way worse, because 
you can't change a book." 
</P>
<P>
 At St. Martin's Press, which published two "instant books" at once -- the 
other on Nancy Kerrigan -- mass market publicity manager Jennifer Richards 
said: "It's been really hectic around here." While the contract for the 
Menendez book was signed last October, the last chapter was written a mere 
three weeks ago. With the cover and all previous chapters ready to go, 
production took just one week. "We've gotten it down to a science," said 
Richards. Susan Reynolds

MORE THAN A GOOD READ? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buchwald's autobiography, "Leaving Home," may be all that W. P. Kinsella says 
it is (Book Review, Feb. 6) -- but is it Art? 
</P>
<P>
 AL HIX, HOLLYWOOD A SHADOWY PORTRAYAL 
</P>
<P>
 In his featured article, "Shadowlands: A Bookish Film" (Book Review, Jan. 23), 
William Griffin takes a poke at author J. R. R. Tolkien that is undeserved. In 
20 years of reading books by and about the author, I have yet to come across 
this so-called "oft-expressed view" of Tolkien's that any book written faster 
than his own books couldn't possibly be good. 
</P>
<P>
 It is no secret that privately Tolkien disliked Joy Davidman Gresham. But to 
depict him in the movie (in the guise of the fictional Christopher Riley) as 
being publicly rude to Joy is a gross distortion by the filmmakers of the kind 
of man Tolkien was. Humphrey Carpenter, Tolkien's biographer, wrote of the 
man's "natural courtesy," which extended well beyond Tolkien's circle of family 
and friends to include myriad devoted fans of his books who appeared, 
uninvited, on his doorstep at all hours of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Tolkien's friendship with C. S Lewis was extraordinarily complex. But the 
friendship did have its ups and downs, and when it cooled, there were distinct 
reasons for it. To again quote Carpenter's biography: "Some of (Tolkien's) 
feelings may be explained . . . by (his) resentment of Lewis's expectation that 
his friends should pay court to his new wife -- whereas in the (1930s) Lewis, 
very much the bachelor, had liked to ignore the fact that his friends had wives 
to go home to. But there was more to it than that. It was almost as if Tolkien 
felt betrayed by the marriage, resented the intrusion of a woman into his 
friendship with Lewis -- just as Edith (Tolkien) had resented Lewis's intrusion 
into her marriage. Ironically it was Edith who became friends with Joy 
Davidman." 
</P>
<P>
 The complexities of the friendship, not only between Tolkien and Lewis, but 
among all of the members of the Inklings, are barely touched upon in 
"Shadowlands." Any exploration of the various relationships within the group 
would itself require an entire film -- perhaps two. That being the case, I 
think the filmmakers, as well as Mr. Griffin, should have foregone the potshots 
at Tolkien if they had no intention of explaining his association with Lewis 
beyond a surface level. 
</P>
<P>
 PAULA DISANTE, GLENDALE RACISM'S DEEP ROOTS 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding Richard Eder's review of "Brazil" by John Updike (Book Review, Feb. 
6). This review is a perfect example of how deeply rooted racism is in American 
society. In writing about the black Tristao who has been turned white by magic, 
the reviewer writes: "His primal energy recedes into a neurotic brooding." 
Again, the black male is portrayed as some beast. I don't know if the 
perpetrator is your reviewer or Mr. Updike, and I don't care. 
</P>
<P>
 And how about this? Isabel, the white girl, turned black by the same magic: 
"Isabel's erotic adoration gives way to a matter-of-fact raunchiness." 
</P>
<P>
 PATRICK SUMLIN, LOS ANGELES THE HISTORICAL EYE 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding your Feb. 6 In Brief review by Erika Taylor of "The Inner Quarters": 
Your reviewer chose to criticize the author of "The Inner Quarters" for "trying 
to look at Chinese culture during the Sung Period without the framework of 
contemporary Western ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 (Taylor quoted the author urging readers to "set aside these modern readings 
of the symbolism of foot binding and to try to see how . . . both men and women 
. . . could have seen tiny bound feet as symbols of beauty rather than 
subjection.") 
</P>
<P>
 Far from being a criticism, this should be a description of a professional 
historian. The goal of history is not to smugly judge another time but to try 
to understand how it really was. It is a mortal sin, and the certain mark of 
bad historical writing, to insist upon viewing another period through the 
distorting prism of our "superior" ideas and knowledge. Yet Taylor goes 
further. She does not merely wish the author to be judge. She wants the past 
condemned for its ignorance of our beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 WILLIAM M. PLACHY, SAN MARCOS EQUAL TERMS 
</P>
<P>
 To answer Donna M. Wilson's letter of Feb. 6 on the term for the male 
equivalent of nymphomaniac. The term is satyr, which is one who has satyriasis 
, which is excessive or abnormal sexual craving in the male. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an equal term for both male and females who have excessive sexual 
feelings. No sexism at all. 
</P>

PRINCELY BOOTLEG; SOME PEOPLE'LL DO ANYTHING TO HEAR THESE SONGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Purely for the perverse palette, Rhino Records has two CDs out in its popular 
"Golden Throats" series, consisting of misbegotten recordings by famous actors 
-- from William Shatner to Jack Webb -- who briefly thought they were singers, 
doing pop standards by Dylan, the Beatles and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there's an entirely contemporary, de facto "Golden Throats Vol. 3" making 
the rounds of camp fans' cassette decks -- though it's not in stores and never 
will be. It's the lost original soundtrack to "I'll Do Anything," featuring 
Julie Kavner, Albert Brooks and Tracy Ullman doing Prince, and it's the most 
sought-after bootleg in town. 
</P>
<P>
 The tapes being circulated include Prince's demos for the nine songs he wrote 
for the ill-fated musical incarnation of James L. Brooks' film, followed by the 
actors' renditions of those same songs, plus a lone Sinead O'Connor 
contribution. All musical numbers were eventually cut from the finished product 
after disastrous test screenings, except for a snippet of a children's tune, 
written by Carole King and sung by young Whittni Wright, that remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Many who've heard the tape agree that director Brooks made absolutely the 
right decision to remove the Prince songs.  
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how bad anybody thinks the music would've been -- and I was 
expecting it to be horrible -- it's worse," says one astonished professional 
songwriter who has played the tape for friends at parties. "It's like 
'Springtime for Hitler' in 'The Producers.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The main theme of the original musical was a Prince ditty called "Wow," the 
lyrics of which are generic enough to pop up in six different reprises 
throughout the movie: Sample chorus: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wow! This is crazy  
</P>
<P>
 Wow! This is wild  
</P>
<P>
 If there ever was a time for reaction  
</P>
<P>
 Baby the time is now  
</P>
<P>
 Seems like we're spending most of our lives  
</P>
<P>
 Just waiting for the big bang  
</P>
<P>
 Extraordinary stuff that makes us say  
</P>
<P>
 Extraordinary things like  
</P>
<P>
 Wow!  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the reprises accompanies a trimmed childbirth scene, in which an 
actress moans and screams her way through the song, singing "Ow!" instead of 
"Wow!" 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Brooks croons two songs: "I'll Do Anything" (lyric: "What good is a 
captain if he ain't got a crew / What good is a me if I AIN'T . . . GOT . . . A 
YOU!") and "There Is Lonely." Brooks' singing voice has been described 
charitably as gravitating toward the Jimmy Durante or Tom Waits end of the 
gravelly scale, and less charitably as an Oscar the Grouch affectation. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are two more torturous tunes that draw the greatest winces from 
illicit listeners. One is Kavner's "My Little Pill," a sort of update of 
"Mother's Little Helper" related to the truncated drug subplot, and recited in 
a maddeningly childlike sing-song voice. The other is Wright's rendition of 
O'Connor's mopey "This Lonely Life" that won't have anyone comparing her to the 
other singing Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
 One track is mysteriously missing from the bootleg tapes: Nick Nolte's 
infamous singing debut on his sole number, "Be My Mirror." Speculates one 
source, "He probably spent his entire salary from the movie buying up every 
single copy of his vocal." 
</P>
<P>
 The tapes that do exist are hard to come by, and have apparently come from 
inside Brooks' company, Gracie Films. Though Warner Bros. Records had the 
soundtrack on its release schedule at one point, a source there close to top 
executives says he doubts that any tape copy ever made its way inside the 
building. And a source with friends at Paisley Park Records' recently disbanded 
L.A. office claims that Prince called there recently asking that all copies of 
the "I'll Do Anything" music be destroyed.*

STAGE WATCH: TAPER STILL STRIVES FOR 2ND STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Oskar Eustis leaves his job as associate artistic director of the Mark 
Taper Forum to become artistic director of Trinity Repertory Company in 
Providence, R.I., he says he's "thrilled with what I did in L.A." But he cited 
one major unfinished task: 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had stayed, I would have devoted enormous energy to try to get a 
functional second stage going" for the Taper. 
</P>
<P>
 Taper artistic director Gordon Davidson has sought a mid-sized theater in the 
250- to 400-seat range for years. Money is not the main problem, Davidson said 
last week: "If we can find or create the right space, we'll find the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike South Coast Repertory, Old Globe Theatre and La Jolla Playhouse -- 
where mid-sized second stages were built within a few steps of the mainstage -- 
the Taper can't create one within its own plant, Davidson said. The Taper used 
the Aquarius in Hollywood as a second stage in 1978-1982 at seating capacities 
ranging from 450 to 1,200 but lacked the money for necessary renovations. And 
the 99-seat Taper, Too is "better suited as a lab," Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson had recently assigned Eustis the task of overseeing the mid-sized 
stage search. Eustis was particularly interested in it because many of the 
plays he helped develop at the Taper had to go elsewhere for full productions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why Things Burn," for example. A Marlane Meyer play set largely in Los 
Angeles as the first Rodney G. King beating verdicts are announced, it was 
commissioned by the Taper and championed by Eustis. But its recent premiere was 
at the 160-seat Magic Theatre in San Francisco. Plays like "Why Things Burn" 
might have done well at a Taper second stage but probably shouldn't be asked to 
attract the 48,000 playgoers who would see a sold-out mainstage run, Eustis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eustis is best known to the L.A. public for his controversial staging of 
"Julius Caesar" (which he had earlier directed at Trinity Rep) in 1991 and for 
"Angels in America," which he co-directed with Tony Taccone in 1992. He brought 
"Angels" with him from the now-defunct Eureka Theatre in San Francisco, where 
he was artistic director in the '80s. But "Angels" playwright Tony Kushner 
chose George C. Wolfe over Eustis to direct "Angels" on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent promotion of Robert Egan to Taper producing director set up Egan as 
Davidson's heir apparent. Closer ties between Davidson and Egan are "completely 
appropriate," Eustis said. So when Trinity came knocking, he found himself 
asking, "What else am I expecting to happen here?" 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson isn't sure if a new associate artistic director will be named. "I 
don't go with job slots, I go with people," Davidson said. "If you try to fit 
someone into the same shoes, you might get a tight fit." But he said he would 
certainly reassign the task of searching for that second stage, though he's not 
yet sure to whom. 
</P>
<P>
 MONEY MAN: The Taper and its sister theater, the Ahmanson, have a new chief 
fund-raiser. Patrick Veitch, the new director of development at Center Theatre 
Group, spent much of the '70s as director of marketing at the Metropolitan 
Opera, much of the '80s as head of the Australian Opera and 1989-91 as 
president of the Pennsylvania Ballet. In 1991 he relocated to Southern 
California, where he has worked as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 GUNN TRIBUTE: The Negro Ensemble Company will sponsor a tribute to actor Moses 
Gunn, who died Dec. 16, at Los Angeles Theatre Center Monday at 7:30 p.m. Gunn 
had performed at LATC in "Fool for Love," "Boesman and Lena" and "Viva 
Detroit." Information: (310) 281-8811.*

ON THE RECORD: SORTING THROUGH A SLEW OF SHOSTAKOVICH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If recorded output is an accurate yardstick, Shostakovich has become the 
public's favorite 20th-Century composer. Whether or not he really is, the vast 
supply of his music must be satisfying some demand out there in consumerville. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from giving us a good deal of valuable, previously little-known material 
along with an equal amount of questionable value, this largesse allows us to 
savor varying interpretive approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The mesmerizing, death-obsessed Symphony No. 14, to poems of Garcia Lorca, 
Apollinaire and Rilke, has had considerable exposure since its 1969 premiere. 
</P>
<P>
 One of its early champions in the West, Leonard Bernstein, opted in his 
performances for a furious, unremittingly theatrical approach, extracting from 
it the last, agonized drops of irony and anger. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein's 1976 recorded version is once again available (Sony 47617, 
mid-price) and it does not hold up well in the face of recent competition, 
notably that provided by the ubiquitous, omnivorous Neeme Jarvi, who directs 
the Gothenburg Symphony, shaping the score's 12 individual numbers according to 
their discreet requirements (Deutsche Grammophon 437 785). 
</P>
<P>
 Jarvi's small orchestra -- only strings and percussion are required -- 
delivers the goods at least well as Bernstein's New York Philharmonic ensemble, 
with the former also having the better soloists: sweet-voiced (all the more 
ironically suited to the dark texts of her songs) Ljuba Kazarnovskaya and the 
virile, accurate Sergei Leiferkus preferable to Bernstein's strident Teresa 
Kubiak and frantic Isser Bushkin. 
</P>
<P>
 Deutsche Grammophon accords the Symphony a worthy discmate (Sony offers none 
at all): Shostakovich's strikingly apt orchestration of the "Song and Dances of 
Death" by Mussorgsky, in a performance of horrific splendor by mezzo Brigitte 
Fassbander, Jarvi and his Swedish instrumentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The composer's two Violin Concertos appear on a CD (Russian Disc 11 025) 
remastered from recordings made in the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory 
during the 1960s: a core component of any collection of recorded Shostakovich. 
</P>
<P>
 The soloists, whose work on both the technical and musical levels is so 
complete as to render criticism superfluous, are Leonid Kogan in No. 1 and 
David Oistrakh, to whom both concertos were dedicated, in No. 2. Conductor 
Kiril Kondrashin and his magnificent Moscow Philharmonic are equal partners in 
both. 
</P>
<P>
 The First Concerto (1955) has achieved popularity in recent years as a 
virtuoso vehicle, with plenty of snotty humor to balance its dark lyricism. The 
almost unremittingly pessimistic Second (1967) is even more of a challenge to 
its protagonist, but pays fewer crowd-pleasing dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 The composer wrote his score for a music hall extravaganza called 
"Hypothetically Murdered" in 1931. 
</P>
<P>
 Basing his orchestration on the composer's surviving piano sketches for the 
otherwise lost original, British composer Gerard McBurney has constructed a 
suite with whose first recording a new British label, United, now introduces 
itself (88001). 
</P>
<P>
 It's good, dirty fun, if not as high on the cleverness scale as the bad-boy 
composer's supremely tacky Suite No. 1 for Jazz Band (1934), which is also 
included. 
</P>
<P>
 The program also offers the Fragments, Opus 42 and the composer's own 
orchestration of his Pushkin Songs (1937). Mark Elder is the expert -- even if, 
in the Jazz Suite, rather too buttoned-up -- conductor of the City of 
Birmingham Symphony in all four works, with basso Dimitri Kharitonov delivering 
the songs with touching simplicity.*

 MASSENET: "Don Quichotte." Jose van Dam, Teresa Berganza, Alain Fondary, 
others; Toulouse Orchestra and Chorus, Michel Plasson, conductor. EMI CDCB 7 
54767 2.The faded charms of late Massenet are revived here by the masterly 
accomplishment of Van Dam, who brings to the French Don Quixote his usual suave 
virtuosity, as tasteful as it is musical. Fortunately the voice, at the age of 
53, is still there to do his bidding. Much the same can be said for the 
voluptuous contribution of a closely miked Berganza, albeit a little 
thick-voiced these days. Fondary is a self-effacing Sancho. He and Van Dam 
avoid bathos in the death scene, which contains the best music in the score. 
Plasson conducts with appropriate passion. WALTER PRICE

 *** Stephane Grappelli, "So Easy to Remember," Omega. After 60 years of 
recording (he turned 86 in January), the violin veteran can't avoid repeating 
himself.But here at least he has the benefit of a full rhythm section, with 
Grady Tate (drums), Ron Carter (bass), and two guitars (why don't the notes 
tell us which solos are by Kenny Burrell and which by Bucky Pizzarelli?). 
Grappelli's legato gentilesse is undiminished as he deals with the usual tunes: 
"Night and Day," "Love for Sale," "How High the Moon" and more.

 *** Contemporary Piano Ensemble, "The Key Players," Columbia. Putting five 
pianists in one studio is a risky venture, yet these men display enough empathy 
to pull it off.A highlight is Bobby Timmons' "Moanin', " for which four Blakey 
alumni -- Donald Brown, Mulgrew Miller, James Williams, Geoff Keezer -- 
interact effectively while the fifth pianist, Harold Mabern, lays out. 
Christian McBride's bass and Tony Reedus' drums flesh out these generally 
bright collaborations.

 * 1/2, Clifford Carter, "Walkin' Into the Sun," Soul Coast. Carter's music has 
a pleasant, floating quality: night sounds for cruising P.C.H. at one in the 
morning.His singing -- soft-spoken, reminiscent at times of Michael Franks -- 
is the perfect expressive instrument for his enigmatic lyrics. But so little of 
substance happens that the album ultimately has the flavor of a plateful of 
appetizers without a main course.

 "REVERIE." Carol Rosenberger, piano. Delos DE 3113. This is the sequel to 
Rosenberger's 1989 recording titled "Perchance to Dream."The pianist has 
assembled a program of miniatures and excerpts from larger works that span two 
centuries, but which are united through their introspective natures. Some of 
the performances emerge simple and touching, such as those of Liszt's "Sancta 
Dorothea" and Schumann's "Traumerei." Others, particularly a mannered Arabesque 
No. 1, by Debussy, and a wholly legato Sarabande from J.S. Bach's French Suite 
in G, fare less well. The overall result is monochromatic; it is hard not to 
daydream while listening to this "Reverie," which can only help perpetuate the 
unfortunate and all-too-common concept of music as background. SUSAN BLISS

 KATHLEEN BATTLE AND JEAN-PIERRE RAMPAL IN CONCERT. Sony SK 53106. Pretty 
chirpy stuff, this. The vocal world of Handel, Purcell and Rameau traveled by a 
light, high soprano and a light, high flute can be wearying.Battle does manage 
to inject some humor into "What can we poor females do?" Her enunciation is 
good. Things pick up marginally with Saint-Saens and Roussel but not by much. 
Michael Head's "Bird Song" is a nod to contemporary music, but it sounds as 
old-fashioned as Bishop's "Lo! Here the gentle lark," which follows. 
Independently, there is some serious music-making in the Martinu sonata, where 
Rampal can relax and savor the Romantic lines and dance rhythms. Battle shines 
in her Obradors songs, where she doesn't have to imitate a calliope, but can 
settle into a sensitive lyric line. Laughter and applause intrusions (the 
performance was recorded live at Lincoln Center) are irritating. WALTER PRICE

 If the rest of the album were totally blank, it would still be an essential 
purchase on the strength of the title tune that opens it. Rarely has there been 
a more consummate blend of singer, arranger, song and lyric.The honors are 
shared by Williams, Robert Farnon with his opulent strings and woodwinds, Artie 
Butler and Phyllis Molinary. Credit also goes to producer John Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's to Life" is a poignant work, powerfully refuting the often-espoused 
theory that "they don't write great songs like that anymore." As icing on the 
cake, the recital ends with a reprise of the tune, this time accompanied by 
George Shearing on piano. 
</P>
<P>
 In between are luxuriant treatments of such standards as "When I Fall in 
Love," "If I Had You," "Young and Foolish" and "A Time for Love." Farnon's 
magnificent writing leaves room for brief solos by two of Britain's finest 
soloists: Don Lusher on trombone, Roy Wilcox on alto sax and flute. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly this was a case of mutual inspiration; the majesty of Farnon's scores 
brought out the best in Williams. Recordings such as this are made not to grab 
a fast dollar but to last forever.

SOUND & VISION: BATTLE OF THE SEXES: THE VIDEO GAME 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Has it been too long since battle of the sexes was a household phrase? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe. Turn on MTV, and the war's in full gear everywhere you look, from 
videos that make playful hay out of male louts -- like the ongoing teen soap 
opera seen in recent Aerosmith videos, and the Don Juan-dissing of ZZ Top -- to 
the more outright feminism of Queen Latifah. 
</P>
<P>
 For nostalgia for the prototypal days of women's lib, turn to two silly duet 
clips that invoke the campy memory of Sonny & Cher, the duo whose divorce for a 
generation symbolized a free-spirited thrush escaping a dominating chauvinist. 
</P>
<P>
 And for a less enlightened kind of sexual nostalgia, check out the prostitutes 
in Snoop Doggy Dogg's latest, or the beautiful corpse in Tom Petty's current 
clip. They're all part of this edition of Sound & Vision, in which current 
music videos are reviewed and rated on a 0-100 scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Queen Latifah, "U.N.I.T.Y." "Who you callin' a bitch?" Uh, well, certainly not 
you , Ms. Latifah -- especially given your demonstration in this video of how 
well a solid right hook works as a short-term cure for sexism. 
</P>
<P>
 Other female rappers have made stabs at feminist "answer" songs addressing the 
misogynist side of black pop culture, but Latifah's is the first to 
definitively take on the entire spectrum of thinking that turns a whole gender 
into "ho's" for fun and profit. The video includes a potent scene in which she 
packs up her kids and leaves a physically abusive lover, and another in which 
she lands a punch on a stranger in response to an epithet. There's a lot of 
lib-revisited to cover here, but somehow Latifah comes through looking both 
sexy and like someone who could hurt a fellow if she had to. 
</P>
<P>
 Though guys take most of the heat here, her most powerful lyrics are lobbed 
against those young women who buy into the "gangsta bitch" mentality without 
knowing or caring about the price. Given that there's a female trio out right 
now called Hoez With Attitude, no one should suppose that she's speaking into a 
void. 80 
</P>
<P>
 ZZ Top, "Pincushion." At just the right moment to capitalize on Lorena 
Bobbitt-mania, here's a timely video further celebrating the sharp infliction 
of great bodily harm on philandering sex-aholics. It's violent beyond watchdog 
Sen. Paul Simon's wildest dreams, albeit purely psychic in its gore. 
</P>
<P>
 The story unfolds in two locales: In one, a jilted bride imposes brutal voodoo 
on the groom who didn't show, taking pins, knives and scissors to the rascal's 
photos. Across town, said groom -- who apparently overslept in the company of 
the stripper hired for the bachelor party -- finds himself contorting in all 
sorts of gymnastic agony.  
</P>
<P>
 This very expensive-looking clip, directed by veteran Julien Temple, is 
extremely well-done, viscerally speaking, though the overall vibe is too brutal 
to provide a pleasurable video experience, and you start to wonder just what 
kind of points are being scored. It's remarkable that virtually the entire 
video oeuvre of ZZ Top -- a band that would seem to have a primarily male 
appeal if ever there was one -- has been based around the group superheroically 
defending pretty young things from sexist dolts. Southern chivalry lives, and 
so does trendy male-bashing. 70 
</P>
<P>
 Cher With Beavis and Butt-head, "I Got You Babe." As combinations of 
live-action and animation go, this ain't exactly Gene Kelly dancing with Tom 
and Jerry. And the cynics among us may remain skeptical that 14-year-old 
cartoon metalheads Beavis and Butt-head fantasize about Cher because of her 
tattoos and her thing for "younger dudes" and don't break character for her 
sake just because, well, they're labelmates. 
</P>
<P>
 But is it worth a token heh-heh, heh-heh anyway? Sure. The dunderheaded duo's 
trip through a virtual reality machine to meet the older biker chick of their 
dreams -- and duet on a song born many, many years before they were -- is 
animated like a cross between the '60s psychedelia of "Yellow Submarine" and 
the sketches a stoner kid might carve in his desk during study hall. And, 
predictable as they may be, Sonny Bono and the willful ignorance of pubescent 
boys both remain now, as ever, great butts for jokes. 67 
</P>
<P>
 Elton John With RuPaul, "Don't Go Breakin' My Heart." Elton's weirdly 
bangs-overloaded hair almost qualifies as a kind of drag, so in a sense, having 
RuPaul along for the cross-dressing ride borders on overkill. But for those who 
can stomach a strong case of the camps (and who don't mind that, as a diva, 
RuPaul's limited pipes make Kiki Dee sound like Kathleen Battle), "Heart" has 
its undeniably cute spots, at least in its screen incarnation. Best is 
diminutive El and towering Ru dressing up as Sonny & Cher, though you wonder 
why they didn't take the obvious next step and do Ike & Tina too. 52 
</P>
<P>
 Snoop Doggy Dogg's "Gin & Juice." Or, "House Party IV." Little Snoop's adult 
guardians, silly caricatures of elderly African Americans that might be right 
out of a Kid 'N Play movie, leave our hero alone for the evening with specific 
instructions not to invite ruffians and loose women over. Naturally, Dogg, 
America's favorite gangsta-slacker, invites all of West Long Beach, and fairly 
harmless, laid-back good times in the tradition of "Nothin' but a 'G' Thang" 
ensue. 
</P>
<P>
 Expertly produced and directed by Dr. Dre, "Gin" is the season's funkiest, 
catchiest rap and a divertingly loose video -- which doesn't mean you have to 
like it. It's hard to tell how much of this ode to inebriation is intended as 
rough homage to "Risky Business," but the penultimate scene does involve Dre 
(as successful a procurer as he is producer, apparently) arriving with a cadre 
of "tricks from the city of Compton." Dre's a friend indeed, shooing Dogg into 
a private room with the half-dozen hookers and unraveling a roll of condoms to 
match. Their parents and the Compton city fathers must be very proud. 45 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, "Mary Jane's Last Dance." Petty, playing a 
creepy morgue worker, unzips a body bag and finds the daisy-fresh, comely 
corpse of Kim Basinger ( wrapped in plastic , as Jack Nance used to say on 
"Twin Peaks"). Petty zips her back up, wheels her lifeless form home, and tries 
to enjoy a quiet evening in with his dead date. Only, ha ha, Basinger's head 
keeps flopping over every time he tries to prop it up, and she ain't much of a 
dance partner. Finally, dejected, he dumps her body in the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Not since Alice Cooper's "Cold Ethyl" have the joys of necrophilia gotten such 
an earnest airing in the pop mainstream, and the utterly purposeless perversity 
places this one high in the all-time music video what- the- hell- were- they- 
thinking? pantheon, ruining a perfectly good little Petty tune. 
</P>
<P>
 Though you might think Basinger would've thought twice before accepting as 
inexpressive a role as a dead sex object, you have to give her some credit: It 
is still a better career choice than "Boxing Helena." 17

POP MUSIC CHARTS: THE AWARDS PAY OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 TV strikes again. As expected, performances on the American Music Awards show 
boosted sales of spotlighted artists. Toni Braxton got a lot of exposure, which 
translated into enough sales to push her "Toni Braxton" to the top of both The 
Times' Southern California pop album chart and the national chart. Whitney 
Houston collected the most awards for "The Bodyguard" soundtrack, and the album 
re-entered the chart at No. 6. Enigma, producer Michael Cretu's techno project, 
debuted at No. 2 with its second album, "The Cross of Changes." Looks like 
Enigma's first album may not have been, as many charged, a fluke novelty hit.

POP EYE: WILL THEY KEEP PLUGGING ON ACOUSTICALLY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Hochman

<TEXT>
<P>
 Is MTV getting set to pull the plug on "Unplugged"? 
</P>
<P>
 That's what some management and record company sources are saying following 
talks with the music channel about getting their acts on future editions of the 
popular acoustic showcase that has led to hit albums by Eric Clapton, Rod 
Stewart, 10,000 Maniacs and Mariah Carey. 
</P>
<P>
 The thinking, they say, is that the network, which prides itself on change, is 
beginning to feel that "Unplugged" has grown stale and that the name itself has 
become too much of a generic term for acoustic performances and albums. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, insists an MTV executive. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's never been talk of pulling the plug," says Doug Herzog, MTV senior 
vice president of programming. "There's always ongoing concern that it got so 
big so quickly, how do we keep it fresh and vibrant and guard against the 
concept being co-opted? But the show is a major franchise for us and it's 
budgeted through 1995." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he says, jazz-pop star Tony Bennett has already been confirmed for 
the next round of "Unplugged" tapings in the spring -- evidence, he says, of 
the channel's expansion of the show into unexpected territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Herzog and others at the channel are concerned about perceptions in the 
industry that the "Unplugged" album concept has become a cliche -- a 
perception, he points out, that has slowed the desire of labels and managers to 
score their own "Unplugged" slot. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been times the record companies wanted to put out the records more 
than we did," Herzog says. "But then, we're not in the record business. In any 
case, there will be more special 'Unpluggeds' and more 'Unplugged' records if 
we're smart and inventive about it." 
</P>
<P>
 And where did the rumors of the show's demise come from? 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe from labels that were unsuccessful in getting their artists on the 
show," he says. Steve Hochman

SMALL FACES

 Motown is preparing a year's worth of releases marking the 10th anniversary of 
the 1984 death of Marvin Gaye. Among the collections being put together are a 
four-CD box set and a single CD of previously unreleased tracks recently found 
in Motown's vaults.A tribute album and TV special are also in the works. Also 
scheduled are a "collectors edition" of the 1971 landmark "What's Going On" 
album and the first-ever CD release of "Hear, My Dear," the 1978 album that 
chronicles in detail his breakup and divorce from Anna Gordy, the sister of 
Motown founder Berry Gordy. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Van Halen is still looking for a new manager to replace Ed Leffler, who died 
of cancer last year, but the band is heading back into the studio to start work 
on a new album aimed at a late-'94 release. Meanwhile, singer Sammy Hagar has 
recorded two new tracks for "Unboxed," a best-of collection of his Geffen 
Records solo material, due March 15. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Anthrax's Scott Ian and members of Cypress Hill and Megadeth have joined the 
roster of celebrity snowboarders participating in Board AID, a March 8 benefit 
for the LifeBeat music industry AIDS organization at Snow Summit. Others set 
for the event include the Beastie Boys, Danny Boy from House of Pain, Rikki 
Rachtman, Rage Against the Machine's Zack de la Rocha and 7 Year Bitch. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A&M Records is reissuing "Deep Six," a 1985 anthology originally on the tiny 
Washington state label C/Z that includes the first-ever recordings by such 
Northwest icons as Soundgarden, Green River (which included Stone Gossard and 
Jeff Ament, now of Pearl Jam) and the Melvins.*

 NO MORE MR. NICE GUY: So much for the new, improved, user-friendly Morrissey. 
The English mope-master abruptly canceled several interviews, including one 
with Rolling Stone's Jim Farber, and flew back to England from L.A. without a 
by-your-leave -- also standing up the video crew hired to shoot the clip for 
his new single. 
</P>
<P>
 This was supposed to be the time when Morrissey was turning on the charm in 
order to elevate his status from cult hero to superstar -- that's why he's 
signed up with the powerful Steifel/Phillips management firm, which handles the 
likes of Rod Stewart. Morrissey was apparently cooperative and affable in 
interviews already completed for RayGun, Details and Billboard, but stiffing 
Rolling Stone is not generally considered a good career move for someone who 
wants to reach a wider audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrissey's new publicist, New York-based Michael Pagnotta, doesn't know what 
prompted the singer to bolt, but says it's just the kind of thing that comes 
with the territory of a temperamental artist. He doesn't think it will hurt the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's interesting enough and his (upcoming) album is good enough that I don't 
think people are put off," he says. "It's just a matter of rescheduling it so 
the writer and magazine will be inconvenienced as little as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 It may be too late. A source at Rolling Stone says that the editors there 
have, for the time being at least, cooled to the idea of a Morrissey feature.

ALBUM REVIEW; ***; BECK; "MELLOW GOLD"; DGC  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you put a thousand monkeys in a room with a tape recorder and locked them 
up for a thousand years, you might end up with an album like this one, a 
sputtering-synapse stream of consciousness punctuated by cowboy chords on an 
untuned folk guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when the Nintendo generation demands real aimlessness from its 
heroes -- as gangsta-rap fans demand real-life hardness -- Beck is the 
goods.Every so often -- especially in the hip-hop flavored songs produced by 
Karl Stephenson -- Beck seems to stumble onto a moment of great beauty, and you 
can almost visualize him rubbing his sleepy eyes in wonder at the cool thing he 
has done. And though "Loser" hit the pop moment square on the bunghole -- it is 
truly an astonishing song -- the rest of "Mellow Gold" seems dedicated to 
proving "Loser" was sort of a random occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is to say, whether or not the ingenue thing is an act (one suspects it 
isn't), Beck is closer to Beefheart than he is to the Beatles, a guy as 
impressed with the weirdness of first-generation Delta blues as he is with its 
power. Maybe the rest of the world was expecting "Mellow Gold" to be the 
"Rubber Soul" of L.A. coffeehouse dudes, but Beck seems to have put out a 
"Trout Mask Replica" instead. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent). JONATHAN GOLD

 PRINCE PREMIERE: Is Prince going back to the leaner sound that won him his 
first fame back in the early '80s? 
</P>
<P>
 That's what it sounded like when the enigmatic pop star unveiled his new 
five-piece band, the Beautiful Experience, at a Felliniesque midnight party 
before a celebrity-filled crowd of about 1,000 invited guests at Paisley Park, 
his recording studio in suburban Minneapolis last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the stage at 3:15 a.m. with his new, custom-made gold guitar fashioned 
in the shape of the symbol that is now his name, he opened the 90-minute set 
with three new songs -- "Interactive," "Days of Wild" and "Now" -- revealing a 
new sound of guitar/keyboard-driven funk reminiscent of the "Dirty Mind" era.  
</P>
<P>
 The party was the hottest ticket in the Twin Cities during the National 
Basketball Assn.'s All-Star Game weekend. The eclectic guest list included 
Magic Johnson and his wife, Cookie; All-Stars Danny Manning, David Robinson and 
Dominique Wilkins; baseball star Kirby Puckett and Minnesota Vikings receiver 
Cris Carter; members of Soul Asylum and the Gin Blossoms; Tevin Campbell, 
Salt-N-Pepa, Kris Kross and rapper and TV star Will Smith. The most unexpected 
guest may have been Tony Robbins, the late-night TV power-of-positive-thinking 
guru, who showed up in a black tuxedo. Chris Baker

RESTAURANT NEWS: SPLICHAL WANTS TO DOUBLE HIS PLEASURE DOWNTOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joachim Splichal is hoping to take the culinary-starved office denizens in 
downtown Los Angeles by storm. The chef of Patina on Melrose and Pinot Bistro 
in the San Fernando Valley, will open Cafe Pinot, a California-French bistro 
with a chicken rotisserie and takeout box lunches. Located adjacent to the L.A. 
Public Library, the restaurant will open in September for breakfast, lunch and 
dinner; dinner check prices should be in the $18-$20 range. "There are not very 
many good restaurants in downtown Los Angeles," says Splichal, "and I know the 
quality of food we can deliver is above what other people do."  
</P>
<P>
 He also knows that there are more than 100,000 people working in the all those 
skyscrapers around the area and most of them eat out. That's why he's planning 
another downtown project: He's negotiating with the Museum of Contemporary Art 
to open Patinette, an upscale snack bar, in the courtyard beneath the museum. 
Splichal had originally planned to open the offshoot of Patina next door to the 
restaurant. "It never happened," he says. "The neighbors gave us a lot of 
hassle over parking so we decided not to pursue it." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this isn't the first time Splichal has been high on downtown L.A. 
Ten years ago, he left the very exclusive Regency Club to become opening chef 
at the Seventh Street Bistro. Developer Wayne Ratkovich eventually sold the 
place to chef Laurent Quenioux and then attorney (now mayor) Dick Riordan. (The 
restaurant closed two years ago) 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was downtown before there wasn't that much competition," Splichal 
says. "Now there are quite a few new restaurants, but we will have an edge. 
Cafe Pinot has access to the Maguire Garden. Where else can you go downtown and 
sit between two olive trees and eat lunch?" 
</P>
<P>
 MEATY ASSIGNMENT: Roland Gibert has taken up residence at 72 Market Street, 
but this time the chef was cautious before he accepted the job. His friend, 
Michel Richard, chef/owner of Citrus in Los Angeles, had already approached him 
about possibly cooking at Bistro M, the brasserie he is opening in San 
Francisco. To hook Gibert, 72 Market Street celebrity-owners Dudley Moore, Liza 
Minnelli and Tony Bill offered Gibert a partnership in the Venice outpost. "The 
owners want to take the place to a different level," says Gibert, "and we are 
working on it." 
</P>
<P>
 The French-born chef is once again working on a meaty menu. "Full blast," he 
says. When he closed his critically acclaimed restaurant Tulipe for financial 
reasons in June, Gibert was just getting into cooking haute health cuisine 
(meatless, sugarless and dairyless) at Luma in Santa Monica. Two months later, 
that restaurant closed for financial reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Money might no longer be a problem, but now Gibert, who plans to introduce his 
new menu next month, has other things to worry about. "This is an established 
restaurant," he says, "and I want to make sure my style won't scare people 
away." That's one of the reasons why he won't take some of the long-time faves 
such as the "kick ass" chili off the menu. That, and because, says Gibert, "I 
very much enjoy 'kick ass' chili." 
</P>
<P>
 BEACH, BEACH, BEACH: Michael Franks and Robert Bell have just returned from 
South Miami Beach, where they've been scouting for a chef for Descanso, the 
huge restaurant/bakery set to open in May in Hermosa Beach. South Miami Beach 
is hot right now. According to experts, the area has experienced more recent 
growth per square mile than anywhere else in the United States. "We went to see 
that Ocean Drive scene," says Franks. "L.A.'s too serious now." 
</P>
<P>
 STAR GRAZING: Michel Trama, the Michelin two-star chef of Les Loges de 
L'Aubergade in the town of Puymirol in Bordeaux, prepares dinner at L'Orangerie 
on La Cienega for six nights, beginning Tuesday. But imports don't come cheap: 
a prix-fixe, four-course dinner costs $105; three courses, $85. 
</P>
<P>
 CHEF MOVES: Katsunori Shimbo, who cooked with Claude Segal at Picnic and then

RACHEL! RACHEL?

<TEXT>
<P>
 Highlighting a tiresome old humbug like Rachel Rosenthal ("Inside the 
Rosenthal Zone," by Jan Breslauer, Feb. 6) is just another puff-up of 
"militant" self-promotion, at the ironic expense of truly radical, 
transformative art. 
</P>
<P>
 With such scant notice paid to the unique, provocative, serious artists in our 
midst, it's disheartening to see Calendar pay obeisance to a polyester public 
pratt. Since when does fishing in the overfished waters of women's experience, 
and smugly expressing garden-variety "global ideas," constitute "pushing the 
edge"? In the shriek zone of modern life, is stinking like merry hell now 
beheld as coming up roses? 
</P>
<P>
 These are effete and unfortunate times. Lioness and tiger visionaries are 
hiding out in the wild, while gnat and gerbil "creatives" roar center stage.

 Let us hope against hope that Rosenthal is not insatiable. Given enough time, 
enough grants, enough indefatigable self-promotion, enough shaving cream, she 
has proved that one who cannot play, sing, dance or act -- in short, a 
"performance artist" -- has seen herself, in full color, on the front page of 
daily Calendar (and the cover of Sunday Calendar), looking remarkably like a 
Pope or two. 
</P>
<P>
 It is enough, or should be.

 I want to thank both Jan Breslauer and Max Benavidez for their insightful 
articles on two important interdisciplinary Los Angeles artists: Rachel 
Rosenthal and Daniel Martinez ("Listening to the Militant Muse," Feb. 6). 
</P>
<P>
 As an artist, I feel indeed fortunate to be living in Los Angeles, where many 
artists of diverse disciplines and backgrounds feel passionate about 
challenging cultural beliefs and stereotypical ways of seeing. 
</P>
<P>
 I especially want to thank Breslauer for including a much-needed history of 
Los Angeles performance art and its particular evolution from feminist art 
practice. Current performance and interdisciplinary art forms have major roots 
in the personal, political and spiritual inquiries of our brave California 
sisters during the 1970s and '80s -- an important fact many people forget. 
</P>
<P>
 These hybrid art forms are first and foremost cultural inquiries, not mere 
forums for disgruntled or out-of-work actors.

TEST PATTERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No tears for Hollywood's pathetic dependence on test screenings and whether 
those results should be reported ("Previews -- How Early Is Too Early?" by 
Patrick Goldstein, Feb. 6). 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia marketing chief Sid Ganis says, "You can't write about something 
that's essentially artistic . . . as if it's just business." Right. What is the 
first thing the studios advertise in the trades after a movie's opening 
weekend? Good reviews? Hardly. How much money the movie made is the only 
criterion these people care about. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with the studios' reliance on test results and not going with the 
gut reaction of the director's cut is that they are always searching for the 
audience's lowest common denominator. Sometimes deliberately appealing to that 
kind of audience can work and the grosses can be huge. But that kind of 
audience is frequently fickle and can sway with every faddish breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 If the studios insist they can't live without test screenings, then at least 
they should target the taste makers, people who passionately like or dislike 
the art they've just been exposed to. These are the kind of people who will get 
their friends to see something that they would not have ordinarily wanted to 
see. They pick up the enthusiasm and spread it around. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blade Runner," "Heaven's Gate," "Brazil" and now "I'll Do Anything" are all 
films that probably would have done better business in their original form. 
Those films were designed to appeal to people of taste. The studios hired name 
directors, paid for exceptional actors, got great scripts and got cold feet 
when the films did not attract LCDs (lowest- common- denominator types). What 
did they expect? 
</P>
<P>
 When all is said and done, there is only one guarantee for box-office success 
in this town -- great word of mouth. Ask Heidi Fleiss. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I suppose I should be flattered that "Toys" producer Mark Johnson thinks my 
off-the-cuff comment to Bryant Gumbel had such a decisive impact on that film's 
box-office performance, but I'm afraid he gives me too much credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed by Gumbel to name the likeliest loser of the '92 holiday season, I did 
mention "Toys," but Johnson's suggestion that I made this prediction long 
before the movie was finished is mistaken. In fact, that "Today" show interview 
aired less than three weeks before the movie opened. And it's not true that no 
one had seen the film at that point. "Toys" had already been screened for my 
West Coast staff, who provided me with a depressingly accurate assessment of 
its prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, I sympathize with the frustration of filmmakers trying to produce 
creative and innovative work in the face of second-guessing from the press. And 
an ambitious, unconventional film like "Toys" must be a particular challenge. 
But blaming the movie's failure at the box office on the smattering of early 
bad press it received is a bit of a stretch. "Toys" wasn't hurt by leaks during 
the preview screening process, but by the reaction of critics and the public to 
the film itself.

GUNS N' POSEURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to "Meet Six-Gun Sharon Stone," by Bruce Newman (Jan. 30): 
</P>
<P>
 After "Basic Instinct," one might wonder what Sharon Stone has left to reveal. 
Thankfully, it appears she's also gifted with the social conscience, artistic 
courage and keen intellect to show us "woman revealed in a new way" in her 
forthcoming film. 
</P>
<P>
 And just what is this wonderful new woman about? Stone proudly points out that 
"this character's not trying to run around in the nude so she can get control 
over somebody." Instead, she resolves conflict and gains control as all great 
and principled men have in the past -- by grabbing a gun and blowing someone 
away. And on top of that, she rhapsodizes, "I just love the violence," as 
impressionable young women everywhere take notice. 
</P>
<P>
 I had been afraid that some of Stone's lily-livered, do-gooder sisters like 
Sarah Brady would prevail in their misguided attempt to address and overcome 
America's addiction to violence with the power of their intellect, 
compassionate social conscience and compelling political activism. 
</P>
<P>
 But thankfully, "Thelma & Louise" turned things around, and now Stone has 
further enriched womankind's image by joining the men in preserving one of 
America's most cherished tenets: A gun gives you power and might makes you 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 Way to go, Sharon. You're one way-cool '90s babe.

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; BORN TO BE WILD? CHINA KANTNER SAYS SHE'D RATHER ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 China Kantner, who plays nose-ringed Geena on Fox's new series "Monty," is 
happy to clear up oft-repeated misconceptions about her upbringing. Kantner, 
23, is the daughter of the Jefferson Airplane/Starship's Grace Slick and Paul 
Kantner. She good-naturedly discusses what her childhood was really like. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, she wasn't really named "god" when she was born, as many books 
claim. "When I popped out," she says in a husky voice much like her mother's, 
"the nurse was this sort of religious type. In this cutesy voice, she says: 
'And what are you naming your baby?' And my mom, being my mom, says wryly, 
'We're naming her god, but with a small "g" out of respect.' That's really all 
there is to that story." 
</P>
<P>
 The name China actually came out of respect for the Chinese community in San 
Francisco and her parents' martial arts instructor, Bruce Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 Books chronicling '60s rock culture often draw images of drug-filled, 
Haight-Asbury sessions filled with music and cultural gurus. But Kantner says 
the Slick-Kantner home didn't fit that picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't like David Crosby was sitting around with my parents and a bunch of 
others smoking a doobie," Kantner says. "My parents liked to be alone. And my 
mom was not a hippie. She wore makeup and shaved her arms and legs and went to 
museums!" 
</P>
<P>
 When China Kantner is reminded that it was Jefferson Airplane's song "White 
Rabbit" that welcomed sunrise at Woodstock, she says, "Well, my childhood was 
different because I was exposed to drugs at a very young age. Everyone I knew 
smoked pot and drank, but it wasn't like I ever saw anyone doing lines (of 
cocaine) or acid." She makes it clear that home was exclusively for family. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantner attended a posh private school in Marin County from age 5 through high 
school. She says that sometimes she'd be embarrassed when her mother would show 
up "with blue hair, emerging from this Delorean with both doors open like wings 
. . . I never knew what she would say." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, she grew to emulate her mother, in more ways than one. By 12, she 
knew she "had an obsessive personality." Her drug of choice, like her mother's, 
was alcohol. Both China and her mother are now sober. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sober from 15 to 20 and then I relapsed and now I've been sober for two 
years. I can't say I won't drink again. In reality, I'm a person who shouldn't 
drink, but you cannot predict what will happen," Kantner explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantner went to New York when she was 15 and landed a job at MTV as a veejay. 
"People think that my mom can call up and get me a job," she says. In reality, 
she's auditioned for every role. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did extra work. I did stand-in, worked at clothing stores and at Tower 
Records. I feel like I paid my dues." 
</P>
<P>
 She's thrilled to be on "Monty." "I didn't know I could do comedy." She sees 
her character, a free-spirited foil to Henry Winkler's right-wing talk-show 
host, as "the extreme parts of my life I don't let out." She hopes it will lead 
to her first love -- the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 She keeps in close contact with her rock-goddess mom and rock-and-roller dad 
(as well as her stepparents). What did they teach her that she's most grateful 
for? "To have a sense of humor in everything. They remind me of what a great 
life I have and how lucky I am. I'm glad to be alive." 
</P>
<P>
 "Monty" airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. on Fox.

ON VIEW; COURTROOM FEVER; ON THE DOCKET: MORE SHOWS IN THE MOLD OF COURT TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeffrey Mann faces an Ohio judge because his pit bull mauled and killed his 
wife, and he was charged with murder for ordering the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Verdict: Guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to "Court TV: Inside America's Courts," the 1990s answer to "The 
People's Court," where TV jurisprudence has taken a big leap from disputes over 
unpaid laundry bills and overgrown trees. Thanks to more liberal laws governing 
cameras in the courtroom, the show packs two actual courtroom tales into a 
half-hour. There are no actors, no retired judges, no sound stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is real-life drama," says Robert Friedman, president of New Line 
Television, which distributes and co-produces the show with the Courtroom 
Television Network. "You can't script this better in many cases. What it does 
is take some of the mystique off the courts and open up the proceedings in a 
very responsible way." 
</P>
<P>
 Other shows are jumping on the legal bandwagon. Three other court-oriented 
series, still being sold to stations, are expected to debut come fall: "Judge & 
Jury" with KFI-AM legal talk-show host Bill Handel, "Jones & Jury" with NBC 
News legal correspondent Star Jones, and "I Accuse," featuring face-to-face 
confrontations between crime victims and defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have always loved the courtroom drama," Handel says. "It's where human 
drama is at its most real, compelling gut level. But it's not really a new 
phenomenon. If TV cameras were around (in the 1920s), you would have people 
flocking to their sets to watch the Scopes trial." 
</P>
<P>
 The newest genre has its incarnations in the 1991 launch of Court TV, the 
24-hour cable network that features gavel-to-gavel coverage of trials across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's more interest in this because there's more alienation in society," 
says Jonathan Kotler, professor of journalism at USC and an expert in media 
law. "Watching people go through trials and their real-life trauma allows 
people to vicariously connect with it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Court TV can be seen in only 14.4 million households. So Friedman and 
Court TV founder Steve Brill launched the syndicated show last fall in a bid to 
cross-promote the channel. In markets covering 92% of the country, "Inside 
America's Courts" reaches about 86 million households. 
</P>
<P>
 On Court TV, "We had some of the most extraordinary moments on TV I have ever 
seen," says Andrew Regal, executive producer of "Inside America's Courts." "But 
so few people were able to see it. What this does is give them the best and 
most interesting cases." 
</P>
<P>
 Court TV and "Inside America's Courts" also featured coverage of the 
high-profile trials of Lyle and Eric Menendez, brothers who confessed to 
killing their parents in their Bel-Air home but who pleaded self-defense. And 
viewers were inside the same courtroom of Katherine Ann Power after she 
surrendered to police in Boston for her role in a bank robbery and shooting of 
a police officer 23 years ago. Among their most popular segments, Regal says, 
was the coverage of Charles Manson's parole hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no wonder, because it was just fascinating," Regal says. "But we didn't 
just throw Manson out and say, 'What a wacko this guy is.' We explained the 
process and why he was up for parole." 
</P>
<P>
 Many cases airing on the show, however, haven't otherwise made it out of 
hometown newspapers. A segment that aired earlier this month featured a 
16-year-old skier who became a quadriplegic when he went off a ski jump at 
Killington Ski Resorts in Vermont. He won, and was awarded $4.2 million. But 
the jury also agreed that he was reckless -- and immediately cut its judgment 
in half. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial was "an interesting tug of war between both sides," says host Gregg 
Jarrett. "People learn what their rights are. This is not murder and mayhem 
programming. We really try to do a wide variety of things." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you really look at the pieces carefully, you see that we will do a great 
deal of explaining about the law," Regal says. 
</P>
<P>
 The same attention to the legal system is planned for court shows still on the 
docket. "I Accuse" features mediation sessions, which are attempts to resolve 
cases before they reach trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the talk/court TV hybrids. On "Jones & Jury," Jones, a former 
Brooklyn, N.Y. prosecutor, will arbitrate real-life civil disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 "People on today's talk shows expose their souls, but there is no resolution 
at the end," Jones says. "You'll just hear a promo for the next show about 
big-breasted women. This is different." 
</P>
<P>
 On her show, the studio audience will vote on a judgment, and the litigants 
will be bound by their decision. But Jones says it will not fall victim to what 
she calls "coliseum justice." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll explain the law and how (the audience) should go about making their 
decision," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 On "Judge & Jury," Handel will serve as a quasi-judge and 12 audience members 
will serve as jurors. Cameras will record their deliberations, a la "12 Angry 
Men." 
</P>
<P>
 "This brings (the talk show) to another level," says executive producer Kari 
Sagin. "There are (legal) rules we have. People will come here and tell about 
their lives, but they know it will not be a circus." 
</P>
<P>
 "Court TV: Inside America's Courts" airs at 6 p.m. Saturdays on KCBS.

 What's not to love about Godzilla movies? They're so bad, they're wonderful. 
The special effects are horrendous. But that's nothing compared to the 
atrociously out-of-sync dubbing from Japanese to English. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, TNT and TBS are celebrating the wonders of Godzilla with two 
monster marathons. 
</P>
<P>
 TNT kicks off its Godzilla festival at 2 a.m. Monday with "Adventure Quest 
Godzilla-Thon," featuring Godzilla-themed cartoons. And you may want to also 
set your VCR for its "Godzilla Festival" of movies later that morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Kicking off the nine-hour watchathon is Godzilla's first film, 1956's 
"Godzilla, King of the Monsters." The original version, released in Japan in 
1954 under the title of "Gojira," is well-respected among sci-fi fans. The U.S. 
version, though, eliminated numerous subplots and added a pre-"Perry Mason" 
Raymond Burr as an American reporter named Steve Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 Next up is 1964's "Godzilla vs. Mothra," with Akira Takarada and Yurki Hoshi. 
The fourth entry in the series finds the lizard meeting his match in a mutant 
moth named Mothra. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1970 camp classic "Godzilla vs. Monster Zero" features Nick Adams and 
Akira Takarada. This time around, Godzilla and fellow monster Rodan are 
carried, via flying saucer, to Planet X so they can defend the alien Ghidrah. 
Adams plays an astronaut who falls in love with a toy saleswoman who actually 
is an alien in disguise. The film also is known as "Invasion of the 
Astro-Monsters" and "Monster Zero." 
</P>
<P>
 Godzilla shows his softer side in the 1969 fantasy "Godzilla's Revenge," which 
also stars Kenji Sara. This entry deals with a young boy who learns how to 
fight bullies after getting some advice from Godzilla. The theme song is "March 
of the Monsters." 
</P>
<P>
 The Earth is threatened with yet another alien invasion and it's up to 
Godzilla to save the day in 1975's "The Terror of Mechagodzilla." Katshiko 
Sasaki is the human star. 
</P>
<P>
 "TNT Adventure Quest Godzilla-Thon" begins Monday at 2 a.m. and "Godzilla 
Fest" begins at 7 a.m.

SOUR WELCOME FOR DRUG TO INCREASE MILK PRODUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the commercial use of a 
synthetic drug for cows called bovine somatotropin (BST) that will increase 
milk production ("Drug to Boost Milk Output Set for Sale," Feb. 3). Not only 
could this flood the market with surplus milk and force family farms out of 
business, BST could increase udder infections by forcing a cow to produce more 
milk than it would naturally. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies show that all drugs and hormones given to an animal end up in milk and 
meat and are passed on to the person consuming the product, left for the human 
digestive system to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to understand how the FDA can attack the vitamin industry, threaten 
to reclassify all amino acids as prescription drugs and seek to limit the 
potency of nutrients but approve a synthetic drug for factory farmers to use 
and pass on for human ingestion. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA claims that its primary goal is truthful labeling. Hopefully, this 
goal applies to everything (not just vitamins) and products will indicate that 
they are derived from animals given these drugs, so the consumer has a choice 
whether to buy products with or without these drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Thankfully, there is a choice! There are farmers who are using natural 
alternatives to growth hormones, chemicals, pesticides, etc., on food products.

 The USDA has stated that it is not absolutely sure what health effect BST 
would have on humans. In conjunction with that uncertainty, there have been no 
regulations requiring the distributing companies that have not already refused 
to market the genetically derived milk to label their packages as so. 
</P>
<P>
 I have no desire to participate in this health experiment by the USDA on the 
general population -- and yet, as a consumer, I have no ability to choose if 
the milk I drink comes from a cow injected with genetically engineered hormones 
or not. My choice, then, must be to boycott cow's milk altogether.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: NEW MEMORIES, NEW HOPE FOR A FRIGHTENED YOUNG WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a Compton courthouse in May, 1993, four people strained to understand a 
story being told by a young deaf woman I will call Alicia. A prosecutor, a 
police detective, a clinical social worker and a battered-women's advocate 
fluent in sign language were trying to figure out how this tiny, frightened 
22-year-old ended up in a hospital 10 weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor, furiously taking notes, realized the tale was too complicated 
to absorb while writing. She turned on a tape recorder. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia communicated through pantomime, pictures and rudimentary sign language. 
Her story was translated by Peggie Reyna, the battered-women's advocate, who by 
then had spent many hours with the young woman, trying to teach her how to 
sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia's version of what happened on Feb. 23, 1993, was gleaned from accounts 
of the May meeting and from later interviews with Alicia, the prosecutor, the 
social worker and Reyna: 
</P>
<P>
 On the night in question, Alicia said, she and her family were at home in 
their Compton duplex. Alicia left the ground-floor bathroom and walked 
upstairs. At the top of the stairs, a door was ajar. Inside the room, her 
mother, father and two brothers sat with a stranger, who pulled an envelope out 
of his pocket and spilled something white onto a tray. Alicia realized she was 
seeing something she shouldn't. She forced a tight smile as she walked past the 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 Too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents, she told authorities, came after her. She ran, but her mother 
grabbed her by her waist-length brown hair and jerked her backward as her 
father slammed his fist into her face. Alicia said she grabbed for the phone 
and dialed 119, a number she thought she had learned from watching television. 
Her mother wrenched the phone away and hit Alicia with it. As Alicia fell to 
the floor, her father kicked her in the back. Alicia scrambled to her feet. In 
the struggle, she said, her father ripped her shirt off. She ran into her room, 
slammed the door, grabbed a sheet from her bed, tied it to the bedpost and 
lowered herself out the second-story window. 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the desperation of this woman, who also told authorities that she had 
been raped by her father, a brother and his friend -- though they deny it -- 
that when she ran out of sheet, she simply let go. 
</P>
<P>
 This was how Alicia ended up at King-Drew Medical Center nearly one year ago 
with blunt head trauma.  
</P>
<P>
 And this is how Peggie Reyna saved her. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reyna was called as a last resort. Clinical social worker Sanjay Shah, 
employed by the county at King-Drew, contacted social service agencies and 
battered-women's shelters on behalf of Alicia, but none was equipped to handle 
someone with her problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyna, a survivor of battering herself, works for the Los Angeles Commission 
on Assaults Against Women. She has a bachelor's degree in special education, 
which she pursued after recovering from a vicious beating that left her deaf 
for two years. She is the commission's specialist for women who are deaf, blind 
or physically disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Reyna helped nearly 50 battered deaf women last year, Alicia's was an 
unusual case. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyna was able to glean from Alicia's miming and pictures that she had been 
isolated in her home after becoming deaf, probably around age 7 or 8, probably 
from illness. Alicia had since lost the ability to speak, and never learned 
formal sign language. She had no real living skills at all -- couldn't cook, 
couldn't shop, couldn't take a bus. All Alicia knew how to do was clean. 
</P>
<P>
 Shah confronted Alicia's parents about the alleged abuse, and they admitted to 
him that they had indeed hit Alicia. Alicia's brother, says Shah, also admitted 
hitting his sister, but denied raping her. And the brother's friend told Shah 
that he had consensual sex with Alicia. Alicia's parents explained to Shah that 
their daughter was a discipline problem. As required by law, however, Shah 
reported the suspected abuse to Adult Protective Services. 
</P>
<P>
 To police, the parents denied hitting their daughter and said there was never 
any sexual abuse. Alicia's father told Compton police Det. Catherine Chavers 
that he had locked Alicia in her room the night she fell from the window 
because she wanted to go to a party. 
</P>
<P>
 Sindee Kain-Kerker, the prosecutor, considered filing rape charges against the 
father, brother and brother's friend, and battery charges against the father 
and mother. She decided against it, though, because there was no corroboration. 
Also, Alicia's inability to communicate in formal sign language made testifying 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was extremely credible," said Kain-Kerker. "I definitely believed her. 
It's just that how are you going to present this to a jury? . . . She could not 
articulate in court, she did not know official sign language. She was just 
learning how to sign. Sometimes criminal prosecution is not the best decision 
in the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Alicia's communication problems, however, one thing was as clear as 
the fear in her eyes: The young woman did not want to go home. In fact, she did 
not want any contact with her family at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "They never let her out of the house," said Shah, reading from his file on the 
case. "She was used as a maid. She needed to get out of that family to be 
safe." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After numerous phone calls, Peggie Reyna found a spot for Alicia at a Los 
Angeles shelter for battered women. The shelter allows residents stays of 30 
days while the system of government aid available to them is put into motion. 
</P>
<P>
 The system, however, is not set up for women like Alicia. Because she is not a 
legal resident, she cannot qualify for government aid. Because she is no longer 
a minor, she cannot qualify for help available to children. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyna was outraged. In a perfect world, I asked Reyna: What would you have 
happen to Alicia? 
</P>
<P>
 "Forget a perfect world!" she sputtered. "How about a reasonable world? A 
young woman, who, for all intents and purposes, is a child, absolutely innocent 
of any wrongdoing, who has not (been) allowed to develop language skills, 
living skills, decision skills, has an inalienable right to have that given to 
her . . . and it doesn't matter a damn how old she is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she has a right to the very basic needs that we should provide to 
every child in America: an education, a place to live, warm clothes and regular 
hugs. I will take care of the hugs, but I cannot afford financially to adopt 
Alicia." 
</P>
<P>
 After Alicia's month was up at the shelter, Reyna called her roommate, Sharon 
Hamilton, to announce she was bringing Alicia home. There was no alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Reyna not offered a room, Alicia would have had only two places to go: a 
homeless shelter or back to her family. 
</P>
<P>
 After four days, Reyna found an Orange County battered-women's shelter willing 
to take Alicia for up to a year. After fewer than four months, though, the 
shelter lost its funding and was forced to close. Alicia moved back in with 
Reyna and Hamilton for a couple of days until the Dayle McIntosh Center for the 
Disabled in Garden Grove gave Alicia a home over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, Alicia returned once more to Reyna's, and after a month, Reyna 
finally located the group home for deaf adults where Alicia now lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people have helped Alicia in the last year, from social workers to 
shelter staffers to teachers. But Reyna has given Alicia something precious, 
something Alicia will have no matter where she goes: a commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is, I have fallen in love with Alicia," said Reyna. "I will be 
involved with her as a support system for the rest of her life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia has two parakeets. They perch in a cage of golden wire, chirping away 
in the sunlight. She cannot hear them, but you can guess what draws her to 
them. Like Alicia, they are tiny and fragile and need loving care. 
</P>
<P>
 Her bedroom is filled with stuffed animals she has been given since she 
escaped from her family. Reyna took her shopping recently for new clothes and 
Alicia proudly shows off her wardrobe. Alicia opens her photo albums. She 
smiles in every picture. All of them have been taken since she was hospitalized 
at King-Drew. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have tried to give her new memories," says Reyna. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia's financial situation continues to be precarious. A television and VCR 
with closed-caption capabilities would be a great help to Alicia while she is 
learning to read, but such luxuries are out of the question. Alicia is in 
counseling, and in April, she will start school. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia's parents have tried to contact their daughter, but she refuses to see 
them. She told Reyna recently that she is "divorced" from her family. Reyna and 
Shah, the clinical social worker, say the family is upset and confused about 
Alicia's continuing refusal to see them. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago, Alicia's mother visited Shah to ask about seeing Alicia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mother does not understand," said Shah. "I tell her, 'I don't know where 
she is. She is safe.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia will not talk about her parents. So I ask her, through Reyna, what she 
wants of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Her eyes widen. She signs energetically: "I am learning, learning, learning. I 
want to learn to drive. Practice. Practice. A job. I can make my own money." 
</P>
<P>
 Reyna smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my work," she says, "I feel like I make a difference in someone's life 
every day. But when it's a life like Alicia's, it is the difference."

THE BUZZ: A SWINGING TIME AT THE MONKEY BAR

 The monkeys should be swinging from their branches when Jack Nicholson's 
buddy, Alan Finkelstein, tosses a do at his Monkey Bar restaurant following 
Nicholson's big acceptance speech at the American Film Institute's Life 
Achievement salute on March 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Intrepid reporters that we are, we asked Finkelstein if Nicholson was, in 
fact, a partner in the restaurant.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's a partner in my whole life. He's a partner in everything I do," 
Finkelstein responded vaguely, throwing us off course. 
</P>
<P>
 So then we asked if Nicholson liked being the center of attention at these 
sorts of things. "No. He gets very shy when it comes to accepting an award and 
speaking in front of his peer group," said Finkelstein. 
</P>
<P>
 No, we meant at the party afterward. "Oh, he'll be fine at the party. He'll be 
ready to party after that." 
</P>

 Lots of Heart: While we were shopping for our annual Valentine's Day present 
from Ourself to Ourself, we couldn't believe the mob scene in 90210-land. It 
was like the day before Christmas -- all the free parking lots were full and 
the jewelry stores were packed. Apparently, there wasn't always such a strong 
demand for bijouterie in February. But we started to learn why. Post-quake, 
people had no desire to buy fragile gifts like crystal or glass.  
</P>
<P>
 It also seemed so much more practical to be able to "buy something I can run 
in," we heard.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had a customer whose earthquake kit is her jewelry bag and another who 
sleeps wearing every piece of jewelry she owns," reported Pepi Kelman of Pepi's 
jewelry store on Brighton.

 If It's Tuesday . . . : While speaking of B.H., why did Tuesday become the 
hottest night of the week at Mezzaluna?  
</P>
<P>
 "There seems to be something that goes on in L.A. where restaurants have a hot 
night," said a befuddled Karim Souki, president. "It used to be a very slow 
night, but three or four years ago, Kirk Douglas gave a party for his son on a 
Tuesday and John Paul Mitchell gave a party on a Tuesday, and Mezzaluna is a 
very open space and people walked by and saw these beautiful people.  
</P>
<P>
 "Now it's a scene. People are all dressed up -- best I can characterize it is 
sexy clothes. It's all the same young people you'd find at Tatou on Monday and 
the Olive Garden on Thursday.

OLDER MOMS ARE CENTER OF NEW DEBATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Testing the Limits" (Feb. 6), the headline asks whether a woman in her 
40s, 50s or 60s should have a baby through technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether someone of menopausal age should be a mother is really beside the 
point.Mothers and grandmothers that old and older have had to raise the babies 
born to their own offspring. No one asks if these second-time-around mothers 
should raise their children's babies. 
</P>
<P>
 The discussion should not center on whether mature women should be allowed 
their babies. Rather we should focus on why those so eager to disparage 
motherhood at 50 are unmoved by the greater number of births to unprepared 
mothers 15 and younger. The latter impacts society on a much greater scale.

 The old double standard has again reared its ugly head. Men have fathered 
children in their 40s, 50s, 60s and beyond for generations and this has never 
been questioned. Now when women have been given the means to become parents 
late in life, there is an outcry of indignation.  
</P>
<P>
 The article says: "The struggle to become pregnant may pale in the face of 
raising a child in a world that is not accustomed to vintage parents . . . 
There are no role models." 
</P>
<P>
 Come on now, take a look at my generation. There are lots of older mothers 
including myself. I had a child at age 40 and it worked out wonderfully. This 
son is now 27 and I could not ask for a better relationship. So I say to all 
those women out there who are first time mothers at age 40 and beyond, hang in 
there, the best is yet to be.

HORROR STORIES SELL IN YOUNG FICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Jan. 25 article "Coming of Age on the Printed Page" about young adult 
literature should have been titled "Goodby YA Fiction: Hello Horror." 
</P>
<P>
 I have written more than two dozen books for 12- to 16-year-olds (three made 
into TV after-school specials) on issues such as AIDS, prejudice, nuclear war 
and steroid abuse.One book on teen suicide changed a girl's mind about killing 
herself.  
</P>
<P>
 But that's not what publishers want now. A top New York editor told me horror 
and suspense are what sells. My agent says all her best-selling YA authors have 
seen big drops in income in the last years and that she retired several fine 
manuscripts when they went unsold after a dozen times out. Perhaps, she 
suggests, I should write for younger readers and consider doing horror. 
</P>
<P>
 I love writing for children if I can give them a good story that offers 
guidance and hope, not bloody bodies. My fans say my books speak directly to 
them and make them think. But, despite your encouraging picture of the YA 
market, there will be mighty few new good books for those readers in coming 
years.

EARTHQUAKE ALTRUISM PART OF HUMAN NATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I found Paul Dean's report on the outbreak of altruism in Los Angeles after 
the earthquake to be of great interest ("For Now, At Least, L.A. is the 
Epicenter of Good Deeds," Feb. 1). 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, "random acts of senseless kindness" are basic to the very existence 
of society and always have been in humans and many other species.Such conduct 
is visible in chimpanzees and other primates, as described by Frans De Waals in 
his 1989 book, "Peacemaking Among the Primates." 
</P>
<P>
 When a community such as Los Angeles becomes fragmented into separate 
sub-communities, it can still be held together by arrangements between the 
power brokers for the various factions. When these leaders cannot maintain such 
accommodation, law and order will break down and widespread rioting and looting 
results, as we have seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Post-earthquake Los Angeles is behaving as a community because there was no 
disruption of the ongoing process of accommodation between the leaderships of 
our urban coalition.

MAYBE OUR JURIES ARE GETTING WISER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This response is prompted by Robin Abcarian's article of Feb. 2, "Of Course 
Juries Are Confused." 
</P>
<P>
 Re the phrase "era of a confounding jury," I would rather call it the era of a 
wise jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the courts are dealing with juries who are more informed and sensitive, 
who therefore look at the ills rather than at the symptoms in cases such as 
those involving abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Our society often neglects the importance of compassion. 
</P>
<P>
 Without compassion people become callous and consequently breed a heartless 
and senseless society. The Menendez and Bobbitt crimes are results of 
callousness.

WESTSIDE WATCH: SHE'S RUNNING FOR OFFICE AND PUBLICIZING ONE TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Candidates for lower offices have long utilized "grip-and-grin" pictures of 
themselves hamming it up with well-known elected officials, hoping the 
popularity of the big names will rub off on them. 
</P>
<P>
 So when we received a piece of direct mail last week from Mary Levin Cutler, a 
candidate for Beverly Hills City Council, our initial thought was that she was 
taking this tactic a step further. 
</P>
<P>
 On the outside of the envelope, under the headquarters' address, it was noted 
that President Clinton's Beverly Hills headquarters had been in the same 
location. This was repeated at the bottom of the letter and also included in 
Cutler's newspaper advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 But the second-time candidate in the highly Democratic city insisted she was 
not attempting to tie herself to the first Democratic President in 16 years. 
The headquarters, she explained, was donated by its owner, whom she would 
identify only as a "longtime friend." 
</P>
<P>
 The mention of the office's ties to Clinton were "merely for identification" 
to help those who had been there during the Clinton campaign to find it, Cutler 
said. (The notice on the envelope, she said, was a printer's error that could 
not be corrected in the haste to get the mailer out.) Nevertheless, she may 
want to take note of Assemblyman Richard Katz's experience. He used Clinton's 
San Fernando Valley headquarters last year for his mayoral campaign -- and 
finished fourth in the primary.

 BULGARIAN BOON: From his 16th-floor perch in a Santa Monica office tower, 
Latchezar Christov thinks big thoughts about Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 He must. He is the "honorary" consul general in the recently opened consulate 
on Wilshire Boulevard, responsible for tending to the needs of the estimated 
15,000 Bulgarian expatriates in the Los Angeles area and making American 
companies interested in the Balkan nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Christov is a Bulgarian-born American citizen (hence the "honorary" 
designation), who runs the West Coast office for the New York-based investment 
house Laidlaw Holdings. At the consulate, he presides over a staff of three: 
himself, his wife and a part-time helper. 
</P>
<P>
 Modest as the staff may seem, Christov has big plans for Bulgaria and the 
United States. The former Soviet bloc nation, which democratized in 1989, is 
just waiting to come alive with business, he said. And he is not shy about 
admitting that his position could help his own company make strides in his 
homeland. Christov himself is picking up the unspecified cost for the consulate 
because Bulgaria is too poor to finance it. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the reasons I'm doing this is because Laidlaw is a very 
entrepreneurial firm," said Christov, 54, a Topanga Canyon resident who fled 
communism with his parents and sister in 1948. "I think it is a nice marriage 
of opportunity to wear the two hats of investment banker and consul general." 
</P>
<P>
 What does Bulgaria have to offer? A well-educated, highly skilled populace, 
among other things, Christov said. It was the center of electronic research and 
development for the Soviets, Christov said, pausing to add: "But unfortunately 
it was for weaponry for the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
 Labor costs are low and enthusiasm is high, he promised. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoting a former high-level American diplomat, Christov said Bulgaria is "the 
biggest-kept secret in Europe." 
</P>

 COURT ORDER: Things are getting back to normal at the Santa Monica Courthouse, 
but it is hardly business as usual one month after the Northridge earthquake 
downed ceiling tiles, broke water pipes, shattered windows and emptied file 
cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
 A cartoon drawn by Presiding Judge David M. Rothman and pinned on a corridor 
wall sums it up: "The Rockin' 'n' Rolling Santa Monica Court." 
</P>
<P>
 With the acoustic tile ceilings removed because of possible asbestos danger 
and the carpets ruined by flooding, courtrooms look like stage sets, and the 
goings-on in one court can be heard in another. 
</P>
<P>
 Deprived of their waiting room, jurors pace the hallways, making way for 
deputies to escort criminal defendants to and from hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sucks all the energy out of you," Rothman said. "I never realized how much 
acoustic tiles made this place livable." 
</P>
<P>
 With asbestos removal almost completed, all the courtrooms are expected to be 
back in use this week, Rothman said.

MANDEVILLE CANYON HOMEOWNER, DEVELOPER IN LAND BATTLE; PROPERTY: THE DISPUTE 
INVOLVING A 200-SQUARE-FOOT SWATH INCLUDES ALLEGATIONS OF VANDALISM, A 
VIDEOTAPE AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF A CHAIN-LINK FENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 By the time Brian Ross discovered what was happening to the front of his 
family's Mandeville Canyon home, all that was left for him to do was survey the 
aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 As workers hastily left the scene, a horrified Ross looked over fallen trees, 
ripped-out gardens and a front gate torn from its moorings. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney lingered behind to explain that the work stemmed from a property 
dispute between Ross' parents and the builder of the housing development next 
door. "It was a blitzkrieg," said an angry Ross. "It was all trespassing and 
vandalism." 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface it may seem a simple boundary dispute, albeit one mixing such 
elements as a snatched videotape and a congressman's daughter. But cut deeper 
and the tiff between Ross and developer Barry Hilton has much to do with the 
frazzled nerves of residents still wary of any construction in the wake of 
98-acre Brentwood Country Estates, the bucolic community's first development in 
10 years. (Roads were paved and sidewalks laid, but not a single house has gone 
up yet because of the slow market). 
</P>
<P>
 Ross accuses Hilton of invading his family's turf. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Ross, Hilton had ceded a 200-square-foot swath of land between 
Ross' parents' home and the Brentwood Country Estates to make up for the 
entrance to the development blocking their driveway. The family built another 
entrance to the driveway and a $60,000 stone and stucco wall separating the two 
properties was then erected, Ross said. The cost was split between Hilton and 
Ross' parents. 
</P>
<P>
 But since then, said Ross, his parents and Hilton have been involved in 
litigation regarding a boundary on another portion of the property. It was in 
response to this, he said, that Hilton decided to bring a work crew onto the 
property to re-establish the original property line and install a chain-link 
fence demarcating the boundary. 
</P>
<P>
 A videotape of the installation of the fence was made by a member of the crew 
but was snatched away at the scene by Ross' wife, who is the daughter of Rep. 
Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley). The videotape shows workers tearing up 
shrubbery and trees and yanking down a front gate. Ross' parents are seeking an 
injunction prohibiting Hilton, or any of his employees, from venturing within 
100 yards of their property. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton's lawyers, however, tell a different story. They say the property's 
boundary has never been an issue. And they dispute Ross' assertions that there 
was ever an agreement to transfer the 200-square-foot patch of land. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The property line) never moved," said attorney Barry MacNaughton, who 
represents Hilton. "It's always been where it's been since 1982." 
</P>
<P>
 Though MacNaughton declined further comment until the matter is litigated, he 
acknowledged that the Rosses and Hilton unsuccessfully tried to negotiate a 
settlement to their boundary dispute but that "the parties were never able to 
reach a deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of their differing interpretations of the property line, Ross says 
he remains incensed over what he believes was an act of destruction committed 
for little apparent purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Hilton) was trying to give us a lesson," he said.

CANDIDATES JOSTLE FOR OPEN ASSEMBLY SEATS; CAMPAIGN: 23 DEMOCRATS FILE FOR 
PRIMARIES IN THE 41ST, 42ND AND 47TH DISTRICTS. FRIEDMAN'S AND MARGOLIN'S SEATS 
WILL BE VACANT, AND MOORE'S MAY BE. 
</P>

<P>
 Lured by the prospect of up to three open seats, a flock of would-be Westside 
state legislators, most of them Democrats, have declared their intention to run 
for the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 23 Democrats have signed on for the June 7 primary in the 41st, 42nd 
and 47th Assembly districts.  
</P>
<P>
 The first two seats are being vacated by Democratic Assemblymen Terry B. 
Friedman (D-Brentwood) and Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) has declared both for her current 
Assembly seat and for secretary of state. However, the mere possibility that 
she might seek statewide office has opened the floodgates. Eight Democrats, 
including Kevin Murray, the son of longtime Assemblyman Willard Murray, have 
thrown their hats in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates have until March 11 to make a final decision on which office, if 
any, they will seek. 
</P>
<P>
 In an exception to crowded fields elsewhere, first-term Assemblywoman Debra 
Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) of the 53rd Assembly District, which includes part of 
the Westside, has the Democratic primary to herself. Moreover, only two 
Republicans, both of them relatively unknown, will vie to take her on in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid persistent rumors that she is in line for a job in the Clinton 
Administration, state Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles) declared her intention 
to seek reelection in the 26th State Senate District. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran state Sen. Ralph Dills (D-Gardena) is running in the newly drawn 28th 
Senate District, much of which is new territory for him. Among his Democratic 
primary opponents is Torrance City Councilman George Nakano. David Barrett 
Cohen, who unsuccessfully challenged Rep. Mel Levine several years ago, is the 
only Republican in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 The 41st Assembly District, now represented by Friedman, is a mixed 
Westside-Valley area that has drawn candidates from both sides of the mountain, 
but the field is mostly Westsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Democratic side, the declared candidates include Sheila Kuehl, a 
women's rights attorney from Santa Monica; Roger Diamond, a Pacific Palisades 
attorney who led the fight against oil drilling in the Palisades; and attorney 
Bill Rothbard, also from Pacific Palisades. Rothbard, who is on the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy Board, was an unsuccessful applicant for the job 
of Santa Monica city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl, an expert on spousal abuse, said the issues in the race will be public 
safety, education and health care. Early on, however, the toughest challenge 
will be getting exposure, she acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a battle for recognition," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A key question in this race is how much Friedman will be able to promote his 
friend Rothbard. As a candidate for Superior Court judge, Friedman must follow 
the judicial canons of ethics, which bar political endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Valley, Calabasas Councilwoman Lesley Devine and John Shallman are 
also in the 41st District race. The others in the Democratic field are Edward 
Tabash, a Malibu attorney, and Pat McGuire. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans declaring their intention to run in the 41st District primary are 
Michael Meehan, Peter Eason and Stu Stitch. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest for the seat being vacated by Margolin is even more crowded, with 
eight Democrats declaring for the post. Among the contenders are environmental 
activist Laura Lake, Los Angeles Unified School District board member Mark 
Slavkin and West Hollywood council members Abbe Land and Paul Koretz. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Community College board Trustee Wally Knox and gay rights attorney 
John Duran are also on board. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wide open," said Lake, who sees the issues as people's fear for their 
safety, their jobs and their children's futures. 
</P>
<P>
 The lone Republican in this slam-dunk Democratic district is Robert Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Noticeably absent from the Westside political equation so far is the 
organization headed by Reps. Howard Berman and Henry Waxman, which has 
dominated Westside politics in past contests but has not publicly backed any of 
the candidates in this year's races. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone wants to know what the heck the Waxman-Berman people are doing," 
said Republican consultant Allan Hoffenblum. Open Seating 
</P>
<P>
 There's no shortage of Democrats who have declared an intention to run for two 
open Westside Assembly seats. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * Sheila Kuehl, who once played Zelda Gilroy in the Sitcom "The Many Loves of 
Dobie Gillis," founded the California Women's Law Center. 
</P>

movement.

POLITICS; UNITED THEY STAND AGAINST BEILENSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of political neophytes who were energized by Ross Perot's call to 
"take back their government" is trying to raise $4,000 to $5,000 to run a 
newspaper ad in the coming weeks searching for an unconventional candidate to 
challenge a veteran congressman. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want a different kind of political candidate, they reasoned, you have 
to take an unorthodox approach to finding one. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with long odds, they hope to recruit a "political virgin" to run as an 
Independent for the congressional seat held by veteran Rep. Anthony C. 
Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills). The district, which extends from Sherman Oaks to 
Malibu and up to most of Thousand Oaks, was a hotbed of Perot support during 
the billionaire Texan's 1992 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to show that we are the people who hire our congressman," said Verne 
Balman, a Thousand Oaks businessman and one of the group's coordinators. "They 
tend to represent their parties or their own interests." 
</P>
<P>
 The mad-as-hell activists head a chapter of United We Stand America in the 
Conejo Valley. They run an office with individual contributions, staff it with 
volunteers and meet regularly to discuss their goals of reforming the federal 
government and slicing the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Perot himself appears diminished as a national force, these 
close-knit political outsiders intend to declare their independence by delving 
more deeply into the electoral arena. And, taking Perot at his word, they say: 
"We're the boss." 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, they face serious impediments as they attempt to mobilize 
support without Perot's direct involvement. The tycoon has said that his 
nationwide organization will not endorse candidates for office because such a 
move could jeopardize its tax-exempt status. 
</P>
<P>
 Balman said that local chapters are prohibited by Perot's headquarters in 
Dallas from even contacting the individuals in its area who have contributed 
$15 to join its ranks. The stated reason for the policy is to protect members' 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a national organization who doesn't know its members," Balman said. 
"That's crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks activists must also overcome their lack of political 
experience -- even if they regard this as a plus. And, while these business 
people, retirees, former teachers and postgraduates maintain that politicians 
of both parties are "bought and paid for" by big contributors, they still must 
raise enough money to make their candidate heard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We plan on doing it with people power," said Roger Smith, a Newbury Park 
political independent who says he is disgusted by the government's state of 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 They will need a lot of it. The Conejo Valley group is one of three Perot 
chapters in the 24th District. The two other United We Stand America chapters 
in the west San Fernando Valley and the mid-Valley appear inclined to support a 
Republican rather than join the Conejo Valley chapter's effort to find an 
Independent candidate, Balman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, a nine-term lawmaker regarded as a resilient and resourceful 
campaigner, challenged the group's assertion that it represents even a majority 
of its own membership. He has met with the United We Stand America's members at 
length. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what happens, in my opinion, a lot of the Perot people will support 
me, whether they are Democrats or Republicans," Beilenson said. "Most of them 
are rational, thoughtful, sensible folks." He called the candidate-seekers 
"self-proclaimed arbiters of taste." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert K. Hammer, a Newbury Park investment banker and one of three 
Republicans seeking the GOP nomination, also claimed that he has wide support 
among those who find Perot's ideas appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 He expressed skepticism that the Perot backers would field a candidate this 
year. But, even if they do, he predicted that the impact would be minimal, 
particularly since the Conejo Valley represents a minority of the San Fernando 
Valley-based district. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be some splitting of the vote because there's Democrats and 
Republicans alike in that one slice of the Perot group," said Hammer. "I just 
don't think it's going to make a huge difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Nine Conejo Valley members who attended a recent meeting reflected a mix of 
registered Democrats, Republicans and Independents. They were united in feeling 
alienated from politics and government. 
</P>
<P>
 Perot supporters are especially angry with Beilenson over his votes for 
President Clinton's deficit-reduction plan and the North American Free Trade 
Agreement. Perot opposed both. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no mistake about how the district felt," Balman, a lifelong 
Republican, said of Beilenson. "He's an employee. . . . Arrogant is the word we 
would tag on Tony." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson maintained that NAFTA would create jobs in the United States, expand 
U. S. exports to Mexico and help reduce illegal immigration. But he also said 
emphatically that Balman and compatriots are wrong about district sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, "a majority of the communications we received on NAFTA were in 
support," Beilenson said. "But clearly that was an issue where those who 
opposed it were more adamant about it than those who were in favor. It's clear 
that if a poll were taken on it, that a large majority of people would support 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson also chastised the Perot activists for failing to appreciate the 
impact of his vote on the Clinton budget plan. "It was the only viable effort 
that was available to cut the budget deficit," he said. "In fact, it will and 
it did." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Disillusioned with the Democratic incumbent, the Conejo Valley group 
interviewed the three active candidates for the Republican nomination. In 
addition to Hammer, they are Richard Sybert, a Woodland Hills attorney and 
ex-aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, and Mark Boos Benhard, an Agoura businessman and 
former aide to former Rep. William E. Dannemeyer, a Fullerton Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Perot activists decided that, in the words of one, "the Republicans 
and the Democrats are the same animal." 
</P>
<P>
 "We like all three of them very much," Balman said. "We feel they'd make 
excellent candidates in the traditional sense. But we're not looking for the 
traditional sense."

BRIEFLY; ARTS: $75,000 GETTY GRANT TO PRESERVE BLACK CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Monica-based J. Paul Getty Trust has given a $75,000 boost to a 
project in Indiana aimed at preserving African-American cultural landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana won a grant to identify areas of 
historic importance to blacks in the state.The grant is part of the fund's 
drive to expand cultural diversity in arts and humanities, said program officer 
Timothy Whalen.  
</P>
<P>
 The grant will be used to identify black settlements, stops on the 
"Underground Railroad" and other cultural and historic landmarks in danger of 
disappearing due to highway and urban renewal projects, said Claudia Polley, 
chairwoman of the Indiana foundation's African-American Landmarks Committee.  
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, black places of importance have been the first to disappear in 
urban areas . . . and their rural counterparts are often simply forgotten," 
Polley said.

SPREADING THE WORD; MORMONISM'S TRADITIONAL VALUES APPEAL TO CONVERTS OF MANY 
ETHNICITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Standing at the pulpit of a Mormon meeting house near the Koreatown District, 
Virginia (Ginger) Johnson looked out at the Sunday morning crowd and said, 
"This is what I always envisioned Heaven to be like." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was sharing her fast-day testimony with a crowd made up of blacks and 
whites, Asians and Latinos, five-generation Mormons and recent converts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's now like a mini-U.N.," said Johnson, who is black. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene at a recent meeting of the church's Wilshire Ward underscores the 
remarkable success of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, one of 
the nation's fastest-growing religious denominations and one of the biggest in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is not quite the fastest-growing religious group in the United States 
-- that honor goes to black Pentecostalists known as the Church of God in 
Christ -- Mormonism's gains are striking compared to declines of up to 40% 
reported for some mainstream Protestant denominations. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Mormon figures, church membership worldwide has climbed from 5 
million in 1982 to 9 million today. For the first time in the church's 164-year 
history, half of the world's Mormons now live outside the United States, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The church is on the march at home as well. Fueled by a high birth rate and 
aggressive missionary work, the church in the United States grew by 22.3% 
between 1982 and 1991, according to figures reported by the National Council of 
Churches. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westside of Los Angeles, site of the largest Mormon Temple outside Salt 
Lake City, provides a striking illustration of the church's new diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 The church does not keep records of membership by race. But from Hollywood to 
Westchester, from Pacific Palisades to Koreatown, Spanish-, Korean-, Tongan- 
and Cantonese-speaking wards and branches share leaders and buildings with 
older, English-speaking congregations. 
</P>
<P>
 The area is home to Mormons who come from as far as Armenia and Nigeria, and 
from as near as Hollywood and Mar Vista, part of a growth rate that church 
officials estimate at 5% to 6% a year in California. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After more than a century of denying the priesthood to blacks, the 
announcement of a divine revelation opened that door in 1978 to "every 
faithful, worthy man in the church." Since then, Mormonism has drawn an 
increased number of African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The long ban on entry to the priesthood did not bother James A. Moody, an 
African American who serves as first counselor, the No. 2 position, in the 
Wilshire Ward. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took a long time to get a mayor of a different race in this town, so 
everything takes time," said Moody, 63, a retired oil-truck driver. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of beautiful people in this church," he said. "And if they're 
not beautiful, I make them beautiful. I love them whether they love me or not." 
</P>
<P>
 The attraction of Mormonism for people who may feel out of the American 
mainstream is not new for the religion, which made many of its early converts 
among workers who were pushed aside by the upheavals of the Industrial 
Revolution in the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mormonism continues to appeal to many socially and culturally disoriented 
members of society," wrote Klaus Hansen, author of "Mormonism and the American 
Experience." 
</P>
<P>
 "They are attracted by a lay church that offers active participation to all of 
its members and . . . an instant, socially cohesive group whose authoritarian 
male leaders set boundaries while providing recognition for behavior that 
conforms to group standards. Many converts are especially drawn to the Mormon 
family ideal." 
</P>
<P>
 Ginger Johnson, who now is president of the Relief Society, a women's 
auxiliary group at the Wilshire Ward, knew little about Mormonism when she got 
a call out of the blue on Christmas Eve 14 years ago. The caller said her name 
was Sister Lofton, and she asked Johnson if she would accept "a wonderful 
gift." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking nuns would come by with a present," she remembered, "and since 
when did nuns start doing that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Lofton turned out to be a Mormon missionary. Her gift was an 
introductory lesson about Mormonism -- an intricate, controversial and 
demanding system of beliefs and social ties that was shaped in the backwoods of 
upstate New York and forged by decades of persecution in the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I knew (about Mormonism) was Donny and Marie Osmond, Brigham Young and 
plural marriage," said Johnson, a fortysomething contest coordinator for a 
cable TV show. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me to pray about it and I did," she said, "and I knew it was true." 
</P>
<P>
 What is Mormonism? Neither Protestant nor Catholic, it is a family-obsessed 
lifestyle, a welfare system and a business empire as well as a religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, many other Christian groups find Mormons to be "kind of far out," 
according to Ronald Enroth, a sociologist at Westmont College in Santa Barbara 
who has studied the church. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary reason is Mormonism's view of the Bible as a flawed document in 
need of modern prophecy, he said, along with the church's unique view of the 
afterlife, the virgin birth, and the nature of God and Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 Mormonism proclaims itself to be the restoration of Christ's church on Earth, 
with Joseph Smith Jr., its founder, and his successors speaking as prophets of 
old. 
</P>
<P>
 It offers men a priesthood tracing back to biblical times, and women a role as 
wives, mothers, missionaries and advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 In rites held behind closed Temple doors, white-clad spouses and offspring are 
"sealed" to each other "for time and eternity."  
</P>
<P>
 The spirits of dead ancestors, identified by zealous genealogical research in 
the church's data bank of more than 2 billion names, are also offered a chance 
at glory, and those found worthy are promised resurrection as celestial beings, 
with the privilege to learn at God's feet and eventually to rise to a godly 
status. 
</P>
<P>
 Even God himself, and his consort, the divine Mother, are said to have been 
creatures of flesh and bone in some remote past, who perfected themselves to 
the highest state. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The faith is rooted in the Book of Mormon, which tells the story of immigrants 
from the Middle East who founded elaborate civilizations in the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
 Visited by Christ after the Resurrection, they prospered for centuries, only 
to disappear after falling victim to evil ways and fighting among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Their story, inscribed on golden tablets, was said to have been found by 
Joseph Smith in 1823, guided by a vision of an angel named Moroni. It is an 
image of Moroni, covered in gold leaf, that can be seen holding a trumpet atop 
the Westwood Temple. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, church leaders have set aside some of Smith's teachings, 
notably polygamy. But many singular features of the Mormon lifestyle remain, 
providing its believers with more than enough study, duties and supervision to 
keep them busy. Singing, socializing and entertainment such as "road-show" 
plays put on by youth groups take the edge off the seriousness of it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Mormons are expected to donate a tenth of their income to the church, along 
with the money it would cost to pay for the two meals they skip every month to 
help feed the hungry. They also give time and money to support the church's 
building program and welfare system. 
</P>
<P>
 Mormons wear special undergarments decorated with markings that symbolize a 
covenant with God. They also follow dietary rules known as the Word of Wisdom, 
which bans alcohol, coffee, tea and tobacco and urges the consumption of 
"little meat." 
</P>
<P>
 Families gather on Monday nights for a "home evening" devoted to prayer, study 
and other activities that can range from board games to night skiing. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes, worship and meetings can fill up to 10 hours a week, with volunteer 
pastors, known as bishops, and higher-ranking church officials putting in much 
more time. 
</P>
<P>
 Devout Mormons pray, study and socialize every Sunday at chapels, or meeting 
houses, that are scattered across Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 For strictly ritual purposes, such as marriages, family "sealings" and proxy 
baptism for the dead, they go to temples like the one that has been a landmark 
on Santa Monica Boulevard for 38 years. Only Mormons in good standing may pass 
beyond the building's lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mormon church has virtually no professional staff, and the demands on the 
time of members are often cited by dropouts as the reason for drifting away 
from the church. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who stay find it tiring, but comforting. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to be growing yourself and putting these principles into action, 
so I always say yes," said Jeanine Bentz, 30, of Santa Monica, a former radar 
engineer and mother of three who advises the young women's group in her local 
ward. "It's hard, but I say yes." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a stretch for us but we look out for each other," said her husband, 
Scott, who runs a copying and subpoena service. "That's why Monday night is a 
dead night. Nobody calls because nobody wants to interrupt the Family Home 
Evening." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bentzes, both born to Mormon families, belong to a ward in the church's 
Santa Monica Stake, which covers most of the area west of the 405 Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 A stake is a regional unit like a diocese in the Catholic Church. According 
its president, Robert E. Hedrick, the Santa Monica Stake is not growing as fast 
as others in areas where houses and apartments don't cost as much. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mainly what we have are longtime people who've put a lot of time into the 
community," said Hedrick, 59, who converted as a teen-ager, largely out of 
admiration for the hard work of one of his predecessors as stake president, the 
father of two childhood chums. 
</P>
<P>
 It is elsewhere on the Westside -- in the Los Angeles Stake, the oldest in 
California, which extends through Latino and Asian areas to Downtown, and in 
the Westchester-based Inglewood Stake, which stretches down to the South Bay -- 
that changes in the church can best be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 For James Pak, president of a Korean-speaking branch of the Los Angeles Stake, 
it was the force of his brother's clean living, and his family's lack of 
commitment to its ancient faith, that brought him to the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "We called ourselves Buddhists, but there was no sense of belonging," said 
Pak, 43, of his family in the Korean city of Kwang-ju. 
</P>
<P>
 When his older brother converted after meeting Mormon missionaries at the 
University of Seoul, he was quick to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "He set a good example. He was respected by many," Pak said. "He brought pride 
to the family." 
</P>
<P>
 Now an accountant living in La Crescenta, where there is a Mormon chapel 
within a three-minute drive of his house, Pak makes the 40-minute trip to 
Koreatown a few times a week. There, he runs the affairs of the Korean branch 
and looks out for the spiritual and temporal welfare of its members. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a need for my service," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mormons are generally required to join the ward where they live, but 
exceptions are made for immigrants to study and socialize in their native 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no choice but to accommodate that need," said Howard B. Anderson, 
president of the Los Angeles Stake. "In many ways this helps strengthen 
(immigrant converts) and provide acculturization in a way that's comfortable to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Many families switch to their local wards when their children become 
teen-agers and want to socialize with their high school friends, said Titus K. 
May, Inglewood Stake president. 
</P>
<P>
 May, 57, who traces his roots to Hawaiian and Napoleonic royalty, presides 
over English-speaking as well as Tongan wards, where some men come to meetings 
in their native garb of long robes and straw belts. His middle name, 
Kealiihoolulaauopuowaina, means king who made plants flourish at Opuowaina, a 
place on the island of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 The attitude among his parishioners is not a divisive "us versus them, but, 
'What can we do to help?' " said May, a security officer at Northrop.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said, he vetoed a proposal to take in a Samoan-dominated ward from 
the Carson area as part of a recent restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Samoans and the Tongans, they've got a little thing going on, going back 
to the island times," he laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Tongans converted on their home island, where more than half the 
population is Mormon, said David Latu, 46, a building contractor who is a 
leader of a Tongan-speaking ward based in Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met a girl and she was Mormon," he said, "and when I saw the example they 
set and the principles they teach, it amazed me. So I thought it wouldn't hurt 
if I tried to become a Mormon." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the church's emphasis on education causes many members to follow 
friends and relatives to better opportunities on the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
 For many new converts, especially Latinos who grew up as Catholics or 
Pentecostalists, one attraction is the opportunity to baptize their children or 
their spouses themselves, and to practice the healing rite of the laying on of 
hands, said Keith J. Atkinson, a church spokesman who served as a missionary in 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not to be critical of the Catholic Church, but some of our Hispanic friends 
indicate that kind of empowerment, for them to be able to do those things 
themselves instead of going to the priest or minister to do it, is something 
they found very attractive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Herrera, a 19-year-old missionary from Boston, said that empowerment 
made a difference for his parents, natives of El Salvador, when they converted 
after moving to Massachusetts. He was baptized at his father's hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see a big difference between them and others in the family," he said. "My 
dad's really dedicated. He drank and smoked before, and now he's completely 
left it." 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera is attending church at the Wilshire Ward with other young people who 
devote up to two years after high school to preaching the gospel wherever the 
church may send them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they still knock on doors in the time-honored way, they spend most of 
their time talking to potential converts referred by new members or attracted 
by radio and TV ads. 
</P>
<P>
 With 200 envoys working in the Los Angeles area, they record about 1,300 
baptisms a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a good response in the month after the earthquake," said Bart 
Peterson, a newly arrived missionary from Star Valley, Wyo. "People seem to be 
so humble that they're willing to listen."

<P>
 Topped by a 258-foot spire and a trumpet-blowing statue of an angel covered in 
gold leaf, the Mormon Temple is one of the most dramatic landmarks of Los 
Angeles. But few outside the ranks of devout Latter-day Saints know what goes 
on inside the sanctuary that looms above a steep, wide lawn overlooking Santa 
Monica Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a place of worship -- it is closed on Sundays and Mondays -- the temple is 
the site of rites intended to "seal" spouses to each other and their children 
for eternity, to offer baptism to the spirits of the dead, and for lectures 
about esoteric aspects of Mormon theology. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a genealogical research center nearby that attracts 5,000 
visitors a month, three-quarters of them non-Mormons. The center offers 
computerized access to the church's data bank of more than 2 billion names. 
</P>
<P>
 Opened in 1956, the temple compound sits on 22 acres of prime real estate. The 
church bought the property from silent film star Harold Lloyd in the 1930s, but 
construction was delayed by World War II. The site, which cost $175,000, was 
earlier the headquarters of the historic Wolfskill Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 The temple, one of 45 in the world, serves an area of central and southern 
California with a Mormon population of about 350,000. There are also temples in 
Oakland and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Its high-ceilinged interior is furnished with huge crystal chandeliers, plush 
carpets, overstuffed furniture and a desk where attendants check visitors into 
the sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a huge baptismal font mounted atop 12 statuary oxen in the basement. 
The ground floor is devoted to offices and changing rooms. There are lecture 
rooms with elaborate wall murals of the Garden of Eden and other scenes on the 
second floor, ceremonial rooms on the third floor and meeting rooms on the 
fourth floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Entry to the sanctuary is restricted to Mormons who carry the laminated 
plastic card called the "recommend," which is issued by local bishops and 
attests to good standing in the church. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the temple itself, the compound includes offices, a chapel, 
classrooms, a baseball field, a visitors center, apartments for temple workers 
and a store that sells sacred undergarments and other ritual clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is located atop the Santa Monica Fault, the temple suffered little 
damage in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekly worship services and Sunday school classes are held at local meeting 
houses across Southern California. MATHIS CHAZANOV

BUYERS, REFI'ERS: GET LOAN HELP AT TIMES HOME FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With mortgage rates moving up from their two-decade low, many Southland 
residents are shifting their house-hunting into high gear. And they quickly run 
into myriad questions about home-loan borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
 At The Times' fifth annual Home Buyers and Sellers Fair, buyers and 
refinancers can get answers to their mortgage questions, pre-qualify for a loan 
at lenders' booths, see how their credit stacks up and check the new loans 
available for first-time and move-up buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair will be held from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday, March 19, at the 
Anaheim Convention Center in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 A special exhibit area for entry-level buyers with modest incomes called 
"Paths to Homeownership" and sponsored by Fannie Mae (the Federal National 
Mortgage Assn.) will offer programs and advice on how to become a homeowner. 
Also on hand will be representatives of the California Housing Finance Agency, 
FHA, VA and municipal housing programs, which will present their mortgage 
programs for first-timers.

 Doris McKently recalls the day in the late 1950s when she was in front of her 
Verdugo Woodlands home in northeast Glendale and a Buick crept around the 
corner, its occupants peering out in search of something. "Dad's a relative of 
the Verdugo family," the driver explained, "and he said there used to be an 
adobe around here." 
</P>
<P>
 McKently -- whose parents, Ernest and Jane Bashor, had purchased the 
circa-1860 Verdugo Adobe and surrounding lots in 1946 -- offered the visitors a 
tour of the nearby historical landmark. Out of the car stepped an elderly man 
named Frank Urquidez, whose family had owned vineyards in the Verdugo foothills 
in the early 1900s. Although Urquidez was ailing, he had requested to visit the 
adobe, a place of happy childhood memories. He and McKently walked slowly 
through the grounds, taking in the adobe and Oak of Peace, where Lt. Col. John 
C. Fremont and Mexican Gen. Andres Pico made plans for a peace treaty between 
the United States and Mexico in 1847. 
</P>
<P>
 Urquidez brightened when he gazed up at the hill behind the adobe and said, 
"That's where my father and uncle caught the bear," McKently recalled. The 
bear, Urquidez explained, was later used as an attraction at bullfights. 
</P>
<P>
 McKently was thrilled to hear the tale, because as a teacher and lecturer on 
Glendale history, she had often related the legend of the bears that once 
inhabited the Verdugo Mountains. "There were supposedly so many bears in the 
canyon that if you were going in the early days to a fiesta up in La Canada, 
you'd be met down about where Glendale College is now by a horseman who would 
wave his serape and rattle his spurs to scare the bears away," McKently said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About a month after her meeting with Urquidez, McKently saw his obituary in 
the local newspaper. "This had been his sentimental pilgrimage," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll find many longtime residents with tales of wildlife encounters and 
other colorful reminiscences in Verdugo Canyon in northeast Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Encompassing the neighborhoods of Verdugo Woodlands, Oakmont and Montecito 
Park, Verdugo Canyon is rife with early Southern California history. The area, 
along with the rest of Glendale and other neighboring cities, was part of the 
36,403 acres known as Rancho San Rafael that were granted to retired Spanish 
corporal Jose Maria Verdugo by Spanish Gov. Pedro Fages. The Verdugo Woodlands 
is where Catalina Verdugo, the blind daughter of Don Jose Verdugo, lived in the 
adobe, which is the oldest house in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 What brought residents to the area when developer F.P. Newport lured them to 
the Woodlands in the 1910s still is the attraction today: safe and quiet 
neighborhoods; a highly vegetated, sylvan setting; wildlife, and proximity to 
downtown Glendale, Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The wooded region is bounded on the west by the Verdugo Mountains, on the 
south by Mountain Street, on the east by the Glendale Freeway and San Rafael 
Hills, and on the north by the Oakmont Country Club and Verdugo Boulevard. 
There are about 5,000 single-family and multiple-unit dwellings in Verdugo 
Canyon, according to Glendale city planner Jim Glaser. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the houses were built in the 1920s to 1960s, it is not 
unusual to find a modest 1915-era cottage a couple of doors away from a large, 
remodeled Mediterranean. House sizes and architectural styles are as varied as 
the canyon's $189,000 to $700,000-plus price range, with the average selling 
price at $349,000, said Bonnye LaPenotiere Sirk, owner of Rossmoyne Realty in 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower figure may get you a 75-year-old, one-time weekend cabin nestled in 
the foothills of the Verdugo Mountains, while a higher price might buy a 1980s 
5,500-square-foot house in the Oakmont Country Club area. 
</P>
<P>
 Styles are a mix: besides the adobe and a Rudolph M. Schindler historical 
landmark built in 1941, the canyon offers everything from Spanish Colonial 
Revivals to English Tudors; cottages to big old clapboards to remodels and 
multiple-unit dwellings. With the exception of the tracts built in the 1970s 
and 1980s, most of the houses were custom-built and have large, deep lots, 
according to Sirk. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Gilbertson, a medical anthropologist who commutes 15 minutes to Kaiser 
Permanente in Pasadena, lived on the Westside and in Glendale's San Rafael 
Hills before opting for a 1951 house in the canyon's Oakmont neighborhood last 
July. 
</P>
<P>
 For $275,000, Gilbertson, who is single and lives with her grown daughter, got 
a 1,700-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bath ranch-style home. Besides her quest 
for privacy and safety, Gilbertson wanted "an older, interesting house and 
that's what I found -- all windows, decking, ivy and large oak trees. It's also 
kind of nice to hear the coyotes howl at night." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Moore -- whose mother bought a half-acre lot in the Verdugo Woodlands for 
$1,100 in 1911 and later built a couple of houses on the property -- has 
childhood memories of playing with frogs and turtles in streams that used to 
run through the neighborhoods. "Just the other morning I had a doe and two 
fawns in my back yard -- chewing on my tomato plants." 
</P>
<P>
 A drive through the neighborhood reveals dense vegetation. All of those trees 
and flowers are one of the reasons Mark Norley, a retired art teacher, has 
stayed in the Woodlands since 1957. "From one point in my back yard I can count 
43 different kinds of trees, like redwoods, California live oak, eucalyptus, 
sycamore, date and Washingtonian palms, orange and lemon," he said. "There's 
even a rare Irish yew tree." 
</P>
<P>
 Hedy Murman, 80, is another longtime resident who never saw reason to live 
elsewhere. Murman and her husband, Edwin, built a house next door to her 
girlhood home in 1960, where they raised three daughters. Her Swiss-immigrant 
father, Eugene Mader, forked over $3,000 for an acre in the Woodlands in 1915 
and built a weekend cabin and two other houses on the property. On the advice 
of late Theodore Payne, a well-known Los Angeles area landscaper, Mader planted 
oak trees and California lilac shrubs; several of the oaks remain. Wine was 
made with grapes from the nearby Urquidez vineyards and honey from the hives on 
the family's hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was what you did, of course, in Southern California," Murman said. "You 
had olives from your olive trees and honey from your honey bees." 
</P>
<P>
 For newer residents, like Texas transplants David and Raeanna Williams, both 
33, and daughter Lauren, 2, the canyon's appeal is a bit less romantic but no 
less important: they wanted a safe, clean area with good schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple moved to Glendale in 1991 to open a State Farm Insurance office. 
They rented a house in the city's Rossmoyne neighborhood for a year, and when 
housing prices dropped, they started house hunting. 
</P>
<P>
 After looking at about 30 homes in Glendale, the couple decided on a 
1,360-square-foot cottage-style house for $265,000. Built in 1941, the house 
has two bedrooms, 1 1/2 baths and a detached garage. "Everything out here's 
much smaller than where we came from," David said. "Our house in Arlington was 
twice as big and a third the price. But it's a nice lot and offers plenty of 
room in the back yard for a dog and little girl to run around and play." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby Fremont Elementary School got a good recommendation from neighbors, 
Raeanna said. That, along with the nearby shopping village of picturesque 
Montrose and the house's move-in condition were what sold them on Montecito 
Park. "We were starting a new business and wanted to put all our time and 
energy into that -- not into redoing a house." 
</P>
<P>
 Verdugo Woodlands resident Fern Shochat and her late husband, George, were 
expecting their first child when they moved in 1940 from a rental house on 
Alvarado Street in Los Angeles to the canyon after he landed a teaching job in 
Glendale. The wooded setting with its many squirrels and deer was and always 
will be home, Fern said. "Now I'm alone, but I have big wonderful parties on my 
back patio," she said. "And I always have a view of my own wild hill." 
</P>
<P>
 Shochat said she is embarrassed to reveal -- especially to real estate agents 
-- what she paid 53 years ago for her 1917-built, foothill home: $3,500. The 
three-bedroom, 1 1/2-bath house has been appraised at about $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other day when the house across the street sold, a young man who had 
hoped to get it for his family was so disappointed that he knocked on my door 
and asked me if I wanted to sell mine," Shochat said. "He said it was where he 
wanted to raise his children. And that's the way we felt too." At a Glance

APARTMENT LIFE: CAN RENTER DEDUCT REPAIR COST FROM RENT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN POSTEMA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES, Postema is the editor of Apartment Age 
magazine, a publication of the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles (AAGLA), 
an apartment owners' service group. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I live in Los Angeles and I have a question about locks. What type 
of door locks do landlords have to provide their renters? 
</P>
<P>
 My back door does not have a lock that will work from the outside with a key. 
The only two locks on the door are key-less ones that can only be locked from 
the inside by turning knobs. They render my back door to the garage useless. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite repeated requests, my landlord has shown no inclination to put on a 
deadbolt. Am I allowed to hire a locksmith and have a deadbolt installed, and 
deduct all attendant costs from my rent? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Renters are entitled to door locks that lock from both the inside and 
outside. If after repeated requests the landlord is unwilling to provide you 
with such locks, under state law you can provide your own. While the 
habitability code doesn't specifically list locking doors as a condition of 
habitability, a court case extends that protection to renters. 
</P>
<P>
 When an apartment is uninhabitable, Civil Code Section 1942 says that if the 
landlord refuses to make the premises habitable "within a reasonable time," the 
tenant may do so. You must first give the landlord notice of your intention to 
"repair and deduct" (repair the problem and deduct the money from the rent). 
</P>
<P>
 According to the code, " . . . if the tenant acts to repair and deduct after 
the 30th day following notice, he is presumed to have acted after a reasonable 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the code says, and most courts have ruled, that 30 days is not 
always reasonable notice for correcting all problems -- sometimes it's 3 days, 
particularly for those problems that the court classifies as emergencies -- I 
would still give the owner that much time to fix or replace the lock.  
</P>
<P>
 I always recommend using written notices in owner-renter relationships, even 
though the code doesn't always require them, and doesn't in this instance. 
Since 90% of all evictions are commenced for non-payment of rent, that's 
particularly helpful when you will be spending the owner's rent money for 
something other than the rent. 
</P>
<P>
 For your information, the repair-and-deduct remedy is available to renters 
twice in any 12-month period. The amount of any repair-and-deduct cannot exceed 
one month's rent. Improvements Are Not Required by Law 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We have lived in the same apartment in the Pico-Robertson area of Los 
Angeles for the past 17 years. In all that time, the landlord has never 
improved the interior of our apartment unit. 
</P>
<P>
 We finally replaced the carpets and drapes at our own expense, but this seems 
unfair. Are we entitled to any of the following improvements after any specific 
time of occupancy: inside painting; new carpets, drapes or linoleum, new window 
screens, a new peephole or a new air-conditioner unit? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There is no state or L.A. city law requiring apartment owners to supply you 
with any of the above-listed amenities for your apartment. There are health and 
safety laws about things like missing or torn window screens, which could allow 
vermin infestation, or torn carpeting, which could represent a trip-and-fall 
hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 But even in these situations, the owner could, at his option, repair rather 
than replace the window screens or carpeting. 
</P>
<P>
 However, saving dollars like that doesn't make a lot of sense for most rental 
owners in the current rental market, where, even after the Northridge 
earthquake, there are still a significant number of vacancies and stiff 
competition for renters. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've repeatedly requested improvements like those you describe in your 
letter and the owner hasn't responded -- and if they are important to you -- 
now may be a good time to make a change. Problems Are Best Avoided at the Start 
</P>
<P>
 Q: After searching for several weeks, I finally found an almost perfect 
apartment in Hollywood. There are a few problems, though, and I wonder if I can 
insist that the landlord fix them. 
</P>
<P>
 I have friends living in the building who warned me that the owners are 
unpleasant and generally put off making repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems are: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- The wooden stairs leading to the second-floor apartment wobble and should 
be attached to the wall for added strength. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- The garage door is too heavy and should be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- The two-prong electrical outlets should be converted to three-prong 
outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- The stairwell lamp doesn't work and should be repaired because it leaves 
the entryway to the apartment dark. 
</P>
<P>
 Can I compel the owner to correct these problems before moving in? I would 
really appreciate your advice. 
</P>
<P>
 A: My advice to you is not to rent the apartment under the circumstances you 
describe, unless you can live with the inconveniences you outline in your 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
 You may be able to move in and subsequently get a city or county agency, or 
agencies, to cite the owner to repair some of these problems. For instance, if 
the stairs are unsafe, they would have to be repaired. But I can't think of a 
worse way to begin a landlord-tenant relationship. If I were you, I would seek 
an apartment elsewhere if I couldn't persuade the owner to make the repairs 
before I moved into the apartment.

YOUR MORTGAGE; ELECTRONIC CREDIT REPORTS STIR CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. HARNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES, Distributed by the Washington Post 
Writers Group. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of American home mortgage applicants could be denied loans 
erroneously in the coming months because lenders are switching rapidly to 
all-electronic credit-evaluation systems that rely heavily on raw, unverified 
and often inaccurate data supplied by national credit bureaus. 
</P>
<P>
 That controversial warning was brought to Capitol Hill in early February by 
representatives of a key segment of the credit industry itself -- independent, 
local credit reporting agencies who traditionally have prepared the 
cross-checked, verified reports used by lenders on mortgage loan applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 In private meetings with congressional staff, the agencies charged that major 
lenders are now signing up for so-called "merged infile" electronic reports, 
rather than performing traditional, time-consuming credit investigations. The 
merged reports are produced by tapping into data bases of two or three of the 
national commercial credit repositories -- TRW, Equifax and TransUnion -- and 
then eliminating duplicate information electronically. 
</P>
<P>
 The merged infile reports are attractive to lenders because they can be 
obtained quickly on almost any loan applicant -- often in just three to five 
minutes -- and at a far lower cost than traditional credit reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Merged infile reports go for $11 to $15 apiece. By contrast, the traditional 
approach -- the so-called "residential mortgage credit report," generally costs 
$50 to $60 per applicant and takes 48 hours or more to complete. Borrowers 
ultimately pay for the credit report, whichever approach is used. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the speed and apparent cost savings of all-electronic infile checks, 
according to Terry Clemans, vice president of American Credit Connection Inc., 
a Schaumburg, Ill.-based, credit-reporting agency, "the results to the consumer 
can be catastrophic" when the lender makes decisions on the basis of the 
computer data. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemans cited preliminary results of a new study by the National Assn. of 
Independent Credit Reporting Agencies (NAICRA) that found that of a random 
sample of 1,700 computer-merged infile credit reports for mortgage 
applications, 16% contained erroneous, derogatory information on the applicants 
-- ranging from false data on late charge-account payments to erroneous reports 
of bankruptcy filings by the home buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 3% of the merged infiles contained "tradelines" -- open credit 
accounts -- that didn't even belong to the borrower, and 2% contained erroneous 
"public filings" like tax liens and court judgments against the applicant. Over 
10% of all the merged infiles did not even contain all the outstanding debts 
that the applicants themselves listed as part of the formal mortgage loan 
application. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point," said Clemans in an interview, "is that (the raw data) can't be 
trusted without follow-up verification. You need human involvement to be fair 
to the loan applicant." 
</P>
<P>
 Clemans cited Federal Trade Commission statistics indicating that the No. 1 
consumer complaint to the agency involves credit bureau data -- 31,000 
complaints filed in the last four years alone. Obtaining merged infile data 
from the three repositories "is where we (local, independent credit-reporting 
agencies) begin our work," said Clemans. Agencies such as his routinely 
interview loan applicants to sort out bad or conflicting data, and telephone 
employers, landlords and other creditors to double-check the raw information 
supplied by computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage lenders contacted for comment on the NAICRA complaints on Capitol 
Hill disputed the allegations. Ralph Mozilo, executive vice president of the 
largest mortgage originator in the United States, Pasadena-based Countrywide 
Credit Industries, confirmed that his company has moved away from use of the 
traditional mortgage credit report for all but a fraction of its applicants. 
Countrywide originated $49.5 billion of new loans in 1993, of which about $43 
billion utilized merged infile credit checks at application. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm's experience with the new technique is diametrically at odds with the 
NAICRA study. "I can give you 10 (traditional manual credit reports) and 10 
merged infiles and you're going to see the same information on every one," 
according to Mozilo. "I would challenge anybody to show me differently." 
</P>
<P>
 Countrywide uses electronic credit reporting early in the application stage as 
a way to screen, qualify and if necessary work with borrowers, said Mozilo. "If 
we see problems, we can ask the applicant right on the spot. We have absolutely 
no interest in denying loans to good credit risks." 
</P>
<P>
 Other major lenders echoed Mozilo's points, though most have not moved as 
dramatically to automated underwriting as Countrywide. 
</P>
<P>
 So what does this simmering controversy boil down to for you as a consumer? 
</P>
<P>
 First, the next time you apply for a home loan be aware of the strong switch 
to electronic credit evaluations -- and at least the allegation that unverified 
negative data could go uncorrected and cause a rejection. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, if you find that your lender is indeed using quick, low-cost 
electronic reports, ask whether the savings of $40 to $50 or more are being 
passed on to you. Some lenders reportedly are charging consumers the 
traditional $50 and $60 for credit checks that in reality now cost just $10 to 
$15.

SPEAKOUT: EARTHQUAKE: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; TAX DEDUCTIONS CAN HELP WITH 
DISASTER LOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERENCE FLOYD CUFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES, Cuff is a Los Angeles attorney. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Internal Revenue Service can offer some relief to many Southland residents 
who suffered damage in October's fires or January's earthquake. The most 
important help is a tax deduction for disaster loss. 
</P>
<P>
 But you must do several things to qualify for this relief. 
</P>
<P>
 First, you must be able to prove your loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, your loss must not be compensated by insurance. If you have insurance, 
you can deduct only uncompensated losses on your tax return. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, you must itemize deductions on your tax return to claim non-business 
disaster losses. You cannot just claim the standard tax deduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth, you can deduct only non-business disaster losses that exceed 10% of 
your adjusted gross income. The first $100 of loss is not deductible. 
(California also permits you to deduct disaster losses under rules similar to 
the federal rules. California also uses the 10% and $100 limits.) 
</P>
<P>
 Because President Clinton declared a national disaster in the January 
earthquake, you can deduct your loss on either your 1993 or 1994 tax return. 
You can deduct losses from the October fires on either your 1992 or 1993 tax 
return. If you want to claim fire losses in 1992 and have already filed your 
1992 tax return, you can file an amended 1992 tax return on IRS Form 1040X; 
write "Southern California Fires" at the top of this tax return. 
</P>
<P>
 You may estimate your insurance reimbursements and repair costs in completing 
your 1993 return and then later correct the return using IRS Form 1040X. Also, 
the IRS will let you extend the due date of your 1993 tax return to Oct. 15, 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Where your disaster loss exceeds your current income, you may carry back the 
excess loss three years to get refunds of prior years' federal tax payments. If 
you still have some unused loss, you may carry it forward for up to 15 years. 
The process is complicated, and should be discussed with a professional tax 
preparer. (California also has carry-over rules, but they differ from the 
federal rules.) 
</P>
<P>
 What losses are covered? The disaster-loss tax deduction covers any physical 
damage caused by a disaster. Property damage from either the earthquakes or 
fires will qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 You can deduct breakage and other physical damage to buildings, to other 
structures, to furnishings, to cars and to other belongings. You also can 
deduct damage to landscaping. You can also deduct spoiled food. 
</P>
<P>
 You cannot deduct lost earnings or profits you suffered because of the 
earthquake or fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, you cannot deduct personal expenses resulting from the earthquakes or 
fires, or temporary housing or moving expenses. You cannot deduct medical 
expenses from earthquake or fire injuries as disaster-loss deductions, although 
they may be deductible under the regular medical-expense deduction. 
</P>
<P>
 And you cannot deduct the loss in value of your home because of the threat of 
future earthquakes or fires.  
</P>
<P>
 What happens if you do not repair or replace the damage? You are entitled to 
the deduction when the loss occurs. You do not have to fix the damage to claim 
tax deductions. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you prove your loss? The IRS may not just accept your claim that you 
suffered a $50,000 loss in the earthquake. You must prove what was damaged and 
how much damage you suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 Your tax deduction for earthquake damage to your home is the loss in value due 
to the earthquake. You could have an appraiser determine the value before and 
after the earthquake and subtract the two; the difference is your disaster 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 However, most people will base their deductions on the cost of repairs. Take 
pictures of the damage. Get a good written estimate from a contractor, 
structural engineer or architect. Keep invoices when the work is done. Keep 
insurance claims and reports. These should be enough to get you through an IRS 
audit. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember that your loss is limited to the lesser of your property's cost, or 
its fair market value before the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens if you lost dishes and glassware in the earthquake or furniture 
in the fire? Your loss may be more difficult to prove, but it still is 
tax-deductible if you can prove it. Take detailed pictures of the damage if you 
still can. Before and after shots will help in an IRS audit if you have them. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep receipts when you replace dishes, glassware, furniture, etc. Insurance 
inventories and reports also are good evidence for an audit. 
</P>
<P>
 You may have some tax deductions even if you were insured. Earthquake 
insurance policies have high deductible amounts and pay you only for damage 
above those limits. Uncompensated losses below those limits are tax-deductible. 
Also, you can deduct other damage not covered by your insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Disaster losses (other than business losses) are an itemized tax deduction. 
Claim them on Schedule A (Itemized Deductions) to your tax return. This means 
you have to itemize tax deductions to claim a disaster loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's an example: 
</P>
<P>
 Let's say that you suffered a $100,000 loss, that you received $60,000 from 
your insurance company, and that your adjusted gross income is $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Your starting loss in filling out IRS Form 4684 (Casualties and Thefts) is 
$100,000. You reduce that loss by the $60,000 insurance payment to a $40,000 
uninsured loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The first $100 of your loss is non-deductible. The $40,000 uninsured loss is 
reduced by $100, leaving a $39,900 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 You can deduct the $39,900 loss only to the extent it exceeds 10% of your 
adjusted gross income. Your adjusted gross income is $50,000, and 10% is 
$5,000, so subtract $5,000 from your $39,900 loss. That leaves a $34,900 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 You can claim that loss as an itemized tax deduction on Schedule A (Itemized 
Deductions) to your tax return. This disaster loss deduction is not subject to 
the 2% itemized deduction floor or the 3% adjustment to itemized deductions for 
tax returns reporting adjusted gross income in excess of $111,800. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS is waiving penalties on tax returns filed late on account of the 
earthquake. Generally, penalties will be waived on tax returns due to be filed 
or amounts due between Jan. 15, 1994, and Feb. 28, 1994. Write "L.A. 
Earthquake" on top of these tax returns when you file them. Although penalties 
will be waived, interest on late payments will still be charged. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS has several publications that are useful in determining disaster-loss 
tax deductions. You will need IRS Form 4684 (Casualties and Thefts). You also 
can get IRS Publication 547 (Nonbusiness Disasters, Casualties and Thefts), IRS 
Publication 584 (Nonbusiness Disaster, Casualty, and Theft Loss Workbook), and 
IRS Publication 334 (Tax Guide for Small Business) from the local office of the 
IRS or from the offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. You can 
also order them by calling toll-free (800) TAX-FORM (829-3676). 
</P>
<P>
 For additional tax information, you can call toll-free (800) TAX-1040 
(829-1040), or you can visit an IRS office for walk-in help. Hours are Monday 
through Friday from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. For Spanish-language assistance, you 
can call toll-free (800) 829-4672.

INNOVATIVE OR WACKY, OWNERS CALL THEM HOME

<P>
 Southern California has always been a place where reality and fantasy 
intertwine in commercial architecture. Most home design, however, has remained 
remarkably predictable, even ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 But a few Southland homes stand dramatically apart from their neighbors in 
appearance. It's as if their builders tossed out the rule books to create 
houses unlike any others. Here are five homes that would cause most people to 
ask, "That's a house?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara's Whale House, easily one of the most unusual anywhere, is a 
work of housing art that took engineer/developer Michael Carmichael and a crew 
of 20 workers three years to build. 
</P>
<P>
 When he looked around his wooded one-acre lot in Mission Canyon, Carmichael 
wondered how he could design a house without destroying the natural beauty of 
the site. Finally, he thought, "Why not go with the free-form shape of the 
property?" 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by the fanciful creations of Antonio Gaudi, a turn-of-the-century 
Spanish architect, Carmichael let his imagination run wild. The resulting house 
has no straight lines, no flat walls, no conventional floor plan. In fact, 
nothing about the house is conventional, including the entrance, which is edged 
with rocks to look like a whale's mouth full of teeth. A window high above the 
front door resembles the whale's eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Three levels of living space wind around a rock-covered elevator shaft. Some 
stained-glass windows look to the outside, but most windows overlook the open 
interior courtyard full of oaks and sycamores. Curving rows of cedar shingles 
make up the outside skin of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 What is life like in such an unusual house? Tobias Hildebrand, the house's 
current occupant, described it as "very, very peaceful . . . almost magical." 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I'm in the world's most luxurious tree house," he said. "It 
provides a natural and nurturing environment that encourages flow and 
creativity and helps me focus." 
</P>
<P>
 During construction, the city of Santa Barbara required Carmichael to erect a 
10-foot fence around the property, to prevent gawking passersby from getting 
into accidents. Now, with mature vegetation providing additional cover, the 
Whale House is seldom seen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Privacy is harder to come by in the seaside Orange County community of Sunset 
Beach. But it helps when your house sits 87 feet above ground. 
</P>
<P>
 While utilitarian objects have been converted into homes before, few of these 
have resulted in structures as dramatic as the Water Tower House, located at 
Pacific Coast Highway and Anderson Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The house, which from below resembles a large wooden tub on stilts, takes full 
advantage of a 360-degree view with windows in each room and an observation 
deck at the kitchen/dining level. 
</P>
<P>
 Former owner George Armstrong bought the 45-year-old abandoned tower and the 
ground it sits on from the city of Seal Beach in 1980, and embarked on a 
four-year project to make the interior space livable. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong began by cutting the tower off its supports and lowering it to the 
ground to do the remodeling. Then he removed the outer wooden skin, saving most 
of the original material to reuse (and protecting its status as an historical 
landmark). Adding four feet to the diameter and six feet to the height of the 
tower, Armstrong created a windowed, trilevel, 2,900-square-foot round house 
from the original shell. 
</P>
<P>
 When the building was completed, the tower was hoisted back up to its elevated 
position overlooking the ocean, Huntington Harbor and northern Orange County. 
An elevator moves passengers from ground level to the three living levels above 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The Water Tower is the perfect home for a person who loves privacy and an 
unobstructed view of the ocean. "I've lived in many beach locations and this 
has it all," said current owner Bob Odell. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Far inland, in Mockingbird Canyon near Riverside, another one-of-a-kind house 
is almost impossible to see from the street -- much of the house is 
underground. 
</P>
<P>
 Earth-sheltered is a more accurate term than underground because Riverside's 
building codes didn't permit a completely underground house when Solar Terra 
was built in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Conceived at the height of interest in energy conservation, the house has a 
conventional feel inside and plenty of natural light, although the structure 
was built into a north-facing slope and uses the insulating power of its 
underground location for heating and cooling. 
</P>
<P>
 Architect Charles Brown called Solar Terra a "back to the future" house 
because man has used the inherent heating and cooling features of the earth for 
eons. "We added mechanical systems because we didn't have enough faith or 
experience with the natural technology of earth heating and cooling," Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners Scott and Pam Bergy haven't felt like pioneers in the 11 years they've 
lived in the underground home, even though it came equipped with sophisticated 
UC Riverside monitoring equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Solar Terra proved that earth-sheltered houses like this work," said Scott 
Bergy, a commercial pilot. "And we've saved thousands of dollars on electric 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest problem we've had with our home is when a tree root pierced the 
bedroom wall. It had broken through the outer rubber lining of the house," 
Bergy said.  
</P>
<P>
 Architect Brown designs more-conventional houses these days, but still has a 
soft spot for Solar Terra. "We were trying out the technology then, 
anticipating much-higher energy costs in the next few years," he said. 
"Everything in the house was the best that could be done. The house still makes 
us proud." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 When Catherine Gallagher, a clinical social worker, spotted a picture of the 
Glass Pyramid House, about to be auctioned in foreclosure, she was intrigued. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had just decorated a condo that I adored," she said, "but I was drawn to 
this most unusual of houses. When I saw it, I knew I wanted to live here." 
</P>
<P>
 Set on a Sierra Madre knoll, out of view of neighbors, the pyramid house is 
visited by wild animals more often than by curiosity seekers. Gallagher and a 
maintenance man send the occasional trespasser packing. 
</P>
<P>
 The original design of the 2,900-square-foot pyramid, built in 1972, brought 
visitors into the house across a koi pond and through a heavy, round door to 
the partially underground lower level. But the steps became mossy and the door 
was hard to roll. Now Gallagher uses a ground-level door as the main entrance 
into her glassy domain. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower level of the three-tier house enjoys a constant temperature, because 
it's partly underground. In summer, a fan pulls in cooler air through screened 
openings in the floor of the ground level and expels warm air at the top of the 
pyramid. In the winter Gallagher wears sweaters and uses a portable heater. By 
utilizing both above- and below-ground living areas, she keeps her electric 
bill at a reasonable $60 monthly average. In all seasons, house plants relish 
the abundance of light. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much of the fun of living here is sharing this wonderful space with friends," 
Gallagher said. "They can't understand how I can live in a glass house until 
they come over and see what a practical and comfortable home it is." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another of the Southland's unusual houses is located in a quiet corner of 
Riverside where it points its nose in the air at a 30-degree angle: It's a 
World War II airplane, converted into a home. 
</P>
<P>
 Towed to the isolated site and lifted into place almost 50 years ago, the 
Airplane House rests serenely aloof from the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Beverly Hills, the most visible of the Southland's unusual residences, the 
Spadena House, or the "Witch's Cottage," as it is called, is a stop on the 
star-home tours even though the owner is not in the movies. The house is the 
star.  
</P>
<P>
 Described by architect Charles Moore as the "quintessential Hansel and Gretel 
house," it was originally built as the office for a movie studio in 1921, and 
later moved from Culver City to its present location. 
</P>
<P>
 With a steeply pitched roof gable over the entry, shutters that hang askew and 
small leaded-glass windows, the Spadena House appears modest in size from the 
street. Yet it has two master suites and a 3,500-square-foot interior that is 
charming and spacious. "We can't live like the seven dwarfs," said Doris Green, 
who has owned the house for 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The cottage's fame has grown during Green's ownership, forcing her to learn to 
garden in her front yard without being distracted by onlookers. "I used to run 
in the house when people came by," she said. "Now I'm in a lot of pictures with 
my gardening clothes on." 
</P>
<P>
 When the moat in front of the house began leaking, Green filled it with dirt, 
and planted a cottage garden with cuttings from the neighborhood. Otherwise, 
she has scrupulously maintained the Witch's Cottage in all its original 
fairy-tale exaggeration. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of homeowner chooses an unusual house? Often a surprisingly 
conventional person, according to Dr. Gladys Whipple, a Pasadena psychiatrist. 
"People can express a streak of unconventionality in their personality by 
choosing a house outside the norm," Whipple said. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how you evaluate the advantages of owning a house that is different 
from the neighbors', there is one very big downside. When you want to sell, you 
have to find a buyer willing to take on the care and tending of a whale, keep 
up with the maintenance of a water tower or live with the unrelenting interest 
in a fairy-tale cottage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bergys want more room, Green wants less, Odell's business has moved north 
and the owner of the Whale House has relocated.  
</P>
<P>
 So how do you sell a one-of-a-kind house? 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Water Tower House has been for sale intermittently for five years. 
Recently, however, said agent Elgin Johnson with Coldwell Banker in Costa Mesa, 
the house received commercial zoning, and interest has picked up. The listing 
price is $1.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Brown of Westcoe Real Estate in Riverside has been searching for the 
right buyer for Solar Terra for more than three years. The house is priced at 
$399,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Witch's Cottage has just been re-listed, with John Bruce Nelson & 
Associates of Beverly Hills, at $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Agent Tobias Hildebrand of Fred Sands' Montecito office is marketing the Whale 
House for its investor-owner at $995,000. While waiting for a buyer, he rents 
out the house for small special events, such as weddings.

GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week:  
</P>
<P>
 * For a lush, green lawn this spring and beyond, it's time to aerate, 
fertilize, use pre-emergent weed control, mow at 1 1/2-2 inches and water 
deeply and thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Check out the tuberous begonia bulbs at your garden center.There is a 
delightful array of different varieties that resemble other flowers such as the 
daffodil, camellia, rose or carnation when in bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 * February is a good time to have a special gardening project and one of them 
might be to install a tub garden. Any container can be used so long as it's 
water tight and holds four gallons of water.

INSIDE THE NEW LAS VEGAS; IN THE BELLY OF THE BEAST; WITH 5,005 ROOMS, THE MGM 
GRAND IS THE WORLD'S BIGGEST HOTEL. HOW DO YOU RUN A BEHEMOTH AND KEEP EVERYONE 
HAPPY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The numbers never stop. The stucco-maned lion out front is 88 feet tall. The 
room count is 5,005. The construction bill was $1 billion. The guy in 8303 
wants a continental breakfast, 21303 wants 10 liters of mineral water, and the 
boxer's entourage on the 29th floor -- well, they want a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Which should be fine, because if anybody is in the business of massive 
quantities, it's the people behind the green-tinted glass at the MGM Grand 
Hotel, Casino & Theme Park. Among Las Vegas' three new mega-hotels, the Luxor 
sphinx across the street may exude more hotel-mascot magnetism, and Treasure 
Island down the block may collect greater sidewalk crowds with its marauding 
pirates and sinking ship. But these 5,005 rooms make the MGM Grand the largest 
hotel in the world. Under the same roof, the largest casino pulsates with 3,500 
slot machines, a 15,200-seat arena is just down the hall and 33 acres of theme 
park wait beyond the back door. Just two months after their Dec. 18 opening, 
the MGM's operators say they are routinely renting 4,000 rooms, serving 20,000 
meals and grossing something like $1.6 million per day. In a city that lives by 
numbers, these are figures to reckon with. 
</P>
<P>
 How does such a place handle all the little things that go into making a guest 
happy? By gambling, of course. The house bets that about 350 maids per shift 
can keep up with turnover of 1,500 or more rooms daily. It puts up 38 windows 
at the reception desk and hopes that 500 guests don't step up simultaneously. 
It assigns nine order-takers and 50 waiters and waitresses at a time to handle 
room service on a busy day, and prays that they don't get 2,000 breakfast 
requests at once. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, the house wins. But when the house loses, its guests do, too, and in 
the shakedown of the MGM Grand's first two months, there have been many losses. 
Even Barbra Streisand -- who might have been expected to keep quiet, 
considering the millions she was being paid -- spiced up her New Year's Eve 
concert here with quips about the shortcomings of her quarters. The next 
morning, insiders say, things got worse: 2,000 room-service orders came in 
between 6 and 11 a.m. Service elevators broke down. A computer went down. A 
dishwasher went blooey. The wait for room service stretched from the usual half 
an hour to two hours and beyond. When the hotel's food people talk about that 
morning, they have the look of soldiers who have seen awful, awful carnage. 
</P>
<P>
 Too many mornings like that and the MGM will begin to look like a 
billion-dollar bad bet. Conversely, if the place can consistently keep so many 
guests and gamblers satisfied, it deserves to be studied as a wonder of 
American ingenuity. And so, on the fifth weekend in the young lion's life, I 
stepped down its throat to see what goes on in the belly of the beast. 
</P>
<P>
 The lion is the hotel's public face on The Strip, but for many guests, parking 
is where the MGM experience begins. You find your way to the corner of Las 
Vegas Boulevard South and Tropicana Avenue, roll up the driveway and leave your 
vehicle in the hands of a valet, your luggage in the hands of an attendant. But 
because there are only about 1,200 valet parking spaces to serve 5,005 rooms, a 
casino and eight restaurants, you may instead be redirected to the hotel's 
self-parking structure, as my wife and I were on a busy Saturday night. The 
parking is free there, but the spaces are uncomfortably tight, and a 
100-yard-long tunnel separates you from the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Checking in, you find the long desk, its 38 windows, and behind them, to 
occupy the waiting masses, an 80-panel video screen that flashes panoramic 
images of desert scenes, baseball stadia and advertisements. VIPs have their 
own guarded, glassed-in registration area. Hotel staff members say the goal is 
a 15- to 20-minute check-in for ordinary guests, but during peak hours the wait 
can stretch to 40 minutes and beyond. That situation could ease when the hotel 
opens six windows elsewhere that have been earmarked for guests in large 
groups, but it's hard to be sure. Five weeks after its opening, about 700 rooms 
in the Emerald Tower were not yet in service, which made the MGM's peak guest 
population about 15% smaller than it eventually will be. (By the end of this 
month, MGM management says, all rooms should be finished.) 
</P>
<P>
 On the ground floor, in its casino and public rooms, the hotel is as loud and 
colorful as any Las Vegas lover could hope. The registration area leads 
immediately to the din of gaming: a Monte Carlo area, a Hollywood area, a 
sports area, an Emerald City area. Wolfgang Puck's Cafe stands brightly tiled 
in the middle of it all, offering a short menu with no entrees over $14.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the Emerald City casino, near the lion's head entrance, a 75-foot-high 
crystalline Emerald City rises in a broad atrium. A cast of three-dimensional 
figures from "The Wizard of Oz" stand out front inviting gee-whiz snapshots. 
Around the periphery, the 1,000-seat Oz Buffet attracts long lines; the 
750-seat Studio Cafe surrounds casual diners with posters from old MGM movies; 
a couple of stages offer live entertainment, and a corridor leads to five more 
restaurants, a fast-food court, a couple of retail shops, an arcade, an Oz 
Midway, a supervised youth center and, finally, to the theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 Underfoot sprawl carpets in the best Las Vegas keep-'em-awake-and-spending 
tradition: floral, purple, yellow, red, green and pink. One afternoon, while I 
eavesdropped near the Emerald City, an earnest-looking visitor asked a security 
guard: 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you get used to this carpet?" 
</P>
<P>
 Upstairs, the guest rooms come in four basic flavors: Oz (complete with prints 
of scenes from the movie, gold crown moldings and bedspreads with bright-red 
poppy patterns), Hollywood, the Deep South and Casablanca. There are about 750 
suites, about 330 of which are really oversized bedrooms with a sofa and two 
TVs. Some others, however, perch on the 29th floor, fill 3,000 square feet in 
split-level design and are served by one butler and up to 27 telephones each. 
Prices for standard rooms usually range from $59 (on the slowest nights) to 
$129. The priciest suites, often reserved by the casino and offered free to 
high-rollers, fetch up to $2,500.

<P>
 What kind of service does one get for $2,500 a night? One morning as I spied 
on the food preparation area, one of the butlers suddenly emerged with a custom 
order from the room where fruit is sculpted. He was in a hurry, and on his tray 
he balanced a green melon carved into swanhood, complete with tail feathering. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two-and-a-half minutes!" the butler exulted, never breaking stride. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Woolf, the chairman, president and chief executive officer of the MGM 
Grand, is fond of recalling that he grew up on a farm in Idaho and that he 
comes from a high-school graduating class of 36. When he started work at his 
first 150-room hotel, he says, he asked himself: "My God, how do they do this?" 
</P>
<P>
 That was then. Now, he says, running a 5,005-room hotel is mostly a difference 
of scale, and not as complicated as it may seem. He describes how carefully the 
hotel screened its 100,000 job applicants down to about 8,000 employees ("cast 
members" in the corporate lexicon), how each one had to test drug-free, how he 
hopes that paying well and running a non-union shop (in a highly unionized 
town) will allow better cooperation between management and workers, how he 
plans to carefully measure customer and worker satisfaction. All things 
considered, says Woolf, resonating grandfatherly calm, "I would rather run one 
5,000-room hotel than five 500-room hotels." 
</P>
<P>
 But resonating calm is his job. Just outside Woolf's office, a maintenance 
crew has arrayed buckets and a tarp to catch copper-colored water leaks from 
the new ceiling. Down the hall, an incredulous voice is heard in the 
advertising and promotion office: "Forty-three-foot logos? Today?" A floor 
below in the kitchen area, vice president for food and beverage service Leon 
Schelbert, a 48-year veteran in the business, says opening this hotel was "the 
toughest thing I've done in my life." Behind the front desk, vice president for 
hotel operations Vince Matthews, a 22-year man, calls this "one of the hardest 
things -- and most rewarding things -- I've ever gone through." 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend at hand won't be dull, either. On Saturday, Mexican 
super-lightweight champion Julio Cesar Chavez will top the first major boxing 
bill at the MGM Grand's Grand Garden. On Sunday, the Super Bowl will be 
televised amid much betting and bellowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's about noon on Friday. At a counter in the employee wardrobe area 
downstairs, a waitress arranges herself in a snug black vest. When the costume 
specialist behind the counter punches her computer keyboard, the clothing racks 
mechanically delivers someone's costume from the back of the shop to the front. 
The computerized, motorized, alphabetized storage system serves as repository 
for uniforms of about 6,000 employees, from rainbow-hued epaulets to carefully 
creased slacks, almost every item devised to harmonize with the hotel's 
dominant hue of deep green. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to maintain a dignified silhouette," says Jackie Murphy, the 
costume and uniform manager, decrying the goofiness of garments at other hotels 
along The Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 MGM cast members arrive for work in street clothes, retrieve their lockable 
garment bags and slip into their uniforms. At the end of their shifts, they 
reverse the process and the uniforms are dispatched to an off-site laundry. A 
computer printout of the uniform inventory runs to 60,000 garments. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the hall, uniformed cast members queue up for cafeteria meals -- free 
food on workdays is part of the employment package -- and beyond them, a 
massive preliminary kitchen prepares food for forwarding to the six hotel 
restaurant kitchens. Executive chef Bruno Wehren stands over a 100-gallon vat 
of soup, musing about how "it was always my dream to get a big place and start 
from the beginning." But this place is so big and busy, he says, "I don't think 
anyone can visualize it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the phone reservation rooms, operator are stationed at 62 desks, repeating 
the corporate mantra into their headsets ("Thank you for calling the MGM Grand 
. . . Have a Grand day"), booking rooms and show tickets. Three days before, on 
a slower day than today, the reservation room took 12,151 calls and booked 
1,434 rooms. The tote board shows five of the next seven days booked solid. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight? "Nothing at all," warns the scrawl on the employee bulletin board 
behind the check-in counter. "No walk-ins, no stay-overs, no late checkouts -- 
don't even think about it!" 
</P>
<P>
 In his office behind the reception desk, Matthews ticks off a few staffing 
numbers. There are 86 parking attendants (35 at a time during peak checkout 
times on Sunday afternoons). There are 740 guest-room attendants (usually known 
as maids) who work in shifts of about 350, deployed in pairs. Once things 
settle down to normal, those two-person teams will be expected to clean 16 
rooms per eight-hour shift). 
</P>
<P>
 But in a broader sense, Matthews allows, "I don't know if there will be a 
normal here. Just when you think it's normal, they announce a Barbra Streisand 
show or a Jackson family reunion." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, a little after 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vaso de leche? Mucho gusto."  
</P>
<P>
 So says Robert Corbin, speaking into a telephone headset in the nerve center 
of the MGM's room service operation. Through the window before him, Corbin sees 
hundreds of metal carts and a squadron of cast members arranging fresh flowers 
in tiny vases, juggling coffee carafes, counting cutlery. When a cart is 
cleared for departure, its pilot grabs it and dashes out the swinging double 
doors and down the hall to the service elevator. Two coffees and an orange 
juice to 13209. Bagel, English muffin and coffee to 18327. 
</P>
<P>
 Corbin, 23 years old, born in Puerto Rico and adept in half a dozen languages, 
is this shift's designated Spanish speaker, fielding calls forwarded by the 
eight other room service operators who sit alongside him. The calls come fast 
-- scores of high rollers from Mexico City are here to see Julio Cesar Chavez 
fight -- and Corbin has no chance to browse through the "Let's Study Japanese" 
handbook he keeps by his phone for idle moments. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8:48 a.m., the Chavez people themselves call from the 29th floor to place a 
pre-fight meal order: 12 servings of boiled orange roughy, 12 steamed vegetable 
plates, 12 spaghettis, 12 slices of strawberry shortcake, 12 bowls of fish 
soup, along with sodas and waters. The bill is more than $500 -- not small 
change, but not all that remarkable, either. In its first 21 days, says room 
service manager Suzanne Poland, this operation grossed $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 As the afternoon progresses, fight fans flood the hotel and the valet parking 
area fills to capacity. Boxer Thomas Hearns and his entourage cut a swath 
through the crowds of mere mortals, his handlers ordering strangers to please 
move aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that night, underdog Frankie Randall astounds a crowd of about 12,000 by 
defeating the previously unbeaten Chavez in a 12-round split decision. Chavez 
had been a 17-1 favorite. Soon the halls soon are flooded with men who have 
lost large wagers. By one bank of elevators, two men in sports jackets stand 
with thick wads of cash in hand, silently peeling off $100 bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday is Super Bowl Day, and my cue to exit. While most of the hotel turns 
its attention to the game, my wife and I approach the checkout counter with my 
bags and, tucked away inside them, an MGM guest-opinion survey. The results are 
bound to be incomplete, for several reasons. The hotel's pool wasn't ready yet 
(it has since opened). In the theme park, the Deep Earth Exploration attraction 
is aiming for a spring opening. The hotel's signature production show, to be 
staged in the 1,700-seat Grand Theatre, is scheduled to open later this year; 
no dates have been decided. That unfinished business aside, lodging 
professionals agree that it takes months of operation to get any hotel running. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the MGM is ready enough to rent out its rooms, a guest should feel free 
to let loose with his mixed marks. 
</P>
<P>
 Good marks: Our Thursday night check-in took all of nine minutes. Our 
16th-floor room had a fine view of The Strip and the mountains beyond. We had a 
terrific Southwestern dinner at Mark Miller's Coyote Cafe (an independently run 
restaurant in the compound), and two good and timely room-service breakfasts. 
We enjoyed an expertly assembled Smokey Robinson show in the 630-seat Hollywood 
Theatre (tickets: $44 each). Wake-up calls came on time. When little things 
went wrong, service personnel were cheerful and acted quickly to remedy them. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad marks: Many little things were amiss. The only phone was in a far corner 
of our room, about six paces away from the bed. Busy signals blocked all my 
efforts to directly call any room in the first nine floors. In the shower, the 
hot and cold water indicators were reversed. Downstairs at Leonardo's 
restaurant, a waitress accidentally substituted bruschetta (bread) for 
prosciutto (ham). At breakfast in the Studio Cafe, another waitress substituted 
blueberries for bananas. At the theme park, a computer crash and communication 
breakdown left us standing in line for half an hour. Back up in our room and 
unable to reach room service on Saturday night, we found no mini-bar. (Only the 
hotel's 423 costliest suites, I learned later, have mini-bars.) 
</P>
<P>
 But checking out proves as painless as checking in. With the Super Bowl 
preoccupying the masses, we're in our car and on our way within 20 minutes. 
Soon the world's largest hotel is a distant green speck in the desert, and I'm 
formulating advice for those who would seek it out. 
</P>
<P>
 First, expect big things and friendly people, but keep in mind that whether 
you lay down a penny in the casino or not, you'll be a hostage of odds. Second, 
don't begin your day with the roughy and vegetables and spaghetti and 
strawberry shortcake and fish soup -- it's clearly not the breakfast of 
champions. The City Within a City / MGM GRAND HOTEL, CASINO & THEME PARK

TRAVEL INSIDER: READING BETWEEN THE LINES OF CALIFORNIA B&B GUIDES; LODGING: 
CONSUMERS BEWARE. LISTINGS FREQUENTLY ARE WRITTEN BY THE INNKEEPERS THEMSELVES, 
AND PROPERTIES OFTEN ARE NOT INSPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS, TIMES TRAVEL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not everyone wants to sleep in a stranger's house beneath a shelf of quaint 
collectibles (especially after the events of Jan. 17). But California travelers 
by the thousands continue to look for just that kind of lodging experience, 
even when the alternative is a night in an impersonal but less-costly hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard figures on the B & B trade have always been difficult to come by, since 
the distinctions between a B & B and a small hotel are so hazy. But Neale-May & 
Partners, a San Francisco marketing firm, has pored through guidebooks and 
advertisements to compile a list of 773 California lodgings that call 
themselves bed and breakfasts. That, says Neale-May's Michele Bernhardt, is 
roughly three times as many as five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Other industry observers, including Sarah Sonke, director of the 
Virginia-based American Bed & Breakfast Assn., suggest that growth here and 
around the country has been far more modest. But there seems to be wide 
agreement that bed-and-breakfast operations will continue to hold a high 
profile in years to come -- as evidenced by the estimated 200 B & B guidebooks 
now on the market nationally. This comes despite the price tag attached to B & 
B living: The average California hotel room rented for about $69 last year; 
though no one keeps figures on B&B's, professionals agree that the average room 
would fetch substantially more. 
</P>
<P>
 How does one find the right inn at the right price? 
</P>
<P>
 One potential answer is the 1994 Guide to California Bed & Breakfast Inns, 
compiled by the California Assn. of Bed & Breakfast Inns, published this month 
and available free from the state. (To request one, call 800-862-2543 or write 
the California Division of Tourism, P.O. Box 1499, Sacramento 95812.) The 
60-page guide includes 211 lodgings with descriptions, prices, phone numbers, 
addresses and some drawings. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first time the B & B association has published such a guide 
(though the state has distributed similar efforts from other publishers), and 
the information in it comes principally from the innkeepers. To be listed, they 
must be dues-paying members of the association, an investment of $250 to $300 
per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting this year, association director Sandy LaRuffa says she plans to have 
each member lodging inspected, and to exclude those that fail to meet criteria 
set by the association's leaders. For instance, says LaRuffa, if the word motel 
is on the sign, it shouldn't be advertising itself as a bed-and-breakfast. 
Also, all room doors should have locks and free breakfasts should include "no 
Twinkies. No packaged food." Other recommended attributes may seem less crucial 
-- individually named rooms, personal collectibles on display, an atmosphere 
that will "facilitate networking among guests" -- but on the whole, inspection 
may mean a big step forward for California consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 For Southern California readers, one shortcoming will stand out in the 
guidebook. Just 20 inns are included from the state's eight southernmost 
counties. One reason is that this area has spawned fewer inns than have other 
parts of the state. But several insiders in the California B & B trade say 
another factor is the enduring schism between some innkeepers in the south and 
some in the north. LaRuffa's group is based up north in Soquel, near Santa 
Cruz, and is campaigning to build membership in the south. 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty of other sources in print for B & B information, but they, 
too, need to be examined closely. The guidebook "Bed and Breakfast 1994" (Plume 
Books, $14) has more than 1,000 listings and a track record of nearly 20 years. 
But to be listed, an innkeeper must join the Tourist House Assn. of America and 
pay annual dues of $35. "The Annual Directory of American and Canadian Bed & 
Breakfasts" (Rutledge Hill Press, $18.95) has even more listings, but the 
descriptions of the establishments were written by the innkeepers themselves, 
and the publisher has not visited the inns. 
</P>
<P>
 There are at least two guidebook series with sources that may be more 
reassuring. Authors of the "Recommended Country Inns" series (books on seven 
U.S. regions, from Globe Pequot Press; 1994 editions due out in November) 
pledge that they have visited all inns listed, and that no fees were required 
for inclusion. "Inspected, Rated & Approved" (American Bed & Breakfast Assn., 
$16.95) includes only the 450 lodgings nationwide that paid annual dues of $300 
and passed site inspection. (The director reports 10% to 12% of lodgings that 
apply every year are turned down.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Auto Club of Southern California distributes "Bed & Breakfast Southern 
California" and "Bed & Breakfast Northern and Central California and Nevada" -- 
but unlike American Automobile Assn.'s well-respected regional tour books, 
those listings are not backed up by site inspections. (Copies of the auto 
club's California B & B guides are available to auto club members for $3 each; 
AAA's Southern California B & B guide is available in many bookstores for 
$6.95.)

<P>
 More than 200 Renaissance portrait medals -- pocket-sized pictures cast in 
everything from lead to gold -- are on exhibit through May 1 at the National 
Gallery of Art in Washington. "The Currency of Fame: Portrait Medals of the 
Renaissance" is the first major survey in America of the images that were often 
produced in bulk for distribution as tokens of friendship or business 
relationships. Popes and other grandees sometimes had their likenesses run off 
by the thousands. While many medals were rather crude, some were considered 
masterpieces. Munich councilman Sebastian Ligsalz, above, from left, had his 
portrait done in wood in 1527; King Henry II of France in bronze, 1575, and 
London goldsmith Richard Martin in silver in 1562. When Two-Wheelers Take to 
the Air 
</P>
<P>
 Bicyclists wondering how to pack up their two-wheelers and take them traveling 
may be interested in "Bikes Can Fly: Survey of Airline Baggage Regulations for 
Bicycles," new from the International Bicycle Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will find that taking a bike requires some forethought," says David 
Mozer, director of the fund, a nonprofit organization that promotes bicycle 
transport. Each airline, he says, has its own policies for domestic and 
international flights -- and the rules can change at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bikes Can Fly" describes in detail how to fly with a bike, looks at packing 
options and gives step-by-step instructions to meet airline requirements. It 
also compares domestic and overseas regulations on 40 major airlines. "Bikes 
Can Fly" is available for $5, including postage, from the International Bicycle 
Fund, 4887 Columbia Drive South, Seattle, Wash. 98108. Extremists in Egypt 
Repeat Warning 
</P>
<P>
 Islamic extremists in Egypt are repeating demands that all foreigners, 
including tourists, leave Egypt. Officials at the U.S. Embassy are taking the 
threats against foreigners seriously, although are not urging Americans to 
leave Cairo at this time. 
</P>
<P>
 The militant Islamic Group, which is seeking Islamic rule in Egypt, has 
targeted tourists as part of its campaign to destabilize the government and 
disrupt the economy, which depends heavily on tourism. In December, suspected 
Islamic extremists opened fire on a busload of Austrian tourists visiting an 
ancient church site that was said to have sheltered the holy family during 
their flight into Egypt. Eight tourists were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they do not believe Americans face greater risks than do other 
foreigners, but has cautioned Americans traveling or living in Egypt to 
heighten their security awareness, maintain a low profile and not call 
attention to themselves or their activities.

 For visitors eager to explore one of the most popular attractions in Britain 
-- historic Windsor Castle -- there is good and bad news this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news is that Windsor Castle, just west of the city, has raised its 
entry price to $12 per adult. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that the admission ticket covers all attractions inside the 
castle, where separate fees had been charged. This makes the overall cost of a 
castle visit cheaper by $1.50 than paying separately to see the State 
Apartments, the Queen's Gallery, St. George's Chapel and the Albert Memorial 
Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 Castle officials say the income from the single-price ticket should raise 
about $1.87 million in 1994 toward reconstruction of parts of the castle badly 
damaged by a November, 1992, fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the castle, there are separate charges, as in the past, for Queen 
Mary's Dolls' House and the Exhibition of the Queen's Presents and Royal 
Carriages in St. Albans Street, since these proceeds go to Royal charities. 
</P>
<P>
 After complaints by local residents that, under the new policy, they would not 
be allowed to enter the grounds freely as had been their custom, castle 
officials relented -- and have issued residents' passes. 
</P>
<P>
 For Americans who believe the $12 entry ticket seems steep, Buckingham Palace 
officials, who set the price, say the admission is in line with other royal 
attractions such as the Tower of London, Hampton Court, Warwick Castle and 
Buckingham Palace. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans are not alone in complaining about the high price of some London 
attractions. A report for the British Tourist Authority found that 51% of 
foreign tourists rated London hotels and shops as "expensive" or "very 
expensive." But the brighter side for Americans is that with a stronger dollar, 
prices this year in Britain may be less expensive than last year. WILLIAM TUOHY

WEEKEND ESCAPE: SAN DIEGO COUNTY; DEL MAR WITHOUT A CAR; CAN TWO AUTO ADDICTS 
SURVIVE AS PEDESTRIANS IN LOW-KEY BEACH TOWN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA ELLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angelenos are totally addicted to their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 So imagine me, a native, planning a weekend jaunt sans auto. The mere thought 
gives me separation anxiety. After all, we don't go anywhere without our 
wheels. Not to the neighborhood supermarket, not to a nearby friend's house, 
let alone a weekend 90 miles and 2 1/2 hours away from our City of Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 And call me old-fashioned, but I wanted to ride the rails. Taking the train 
somewhere seemed romantic and adventurous. So I persuaded my friend Amy -- a 
die-hard New Yorker who moved to Los Angeles five years ago and is hopelessly 
addicted to her car phone -- that we should throw caution to the wind and leave 
our automotive security blankets behind. Our destination was the historic 
village of Del Mar, whose development at the turn of the century as a seaside 
resort engendered the building of a train station 18 miles north of downtown 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Del Mar's famous "where the turf meets the surf" horse racing track 
draws hordes of visitors each year for the late-summer racing season, we 
decided an off-season trip would be a more enjoyable and low-key vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 We bought our tickets in advance at Downtown L.A.'s classic Art Deco Union 
Station, and like breezy weekenders of a pre-freeway era, hopped the train 
bound for Del Mar on a recent Friday night. As soon as we boarded the 6:25 p.m. 
San Diegan, we realized our first mistake: not arriving early enough to find 
two seats together. Our second rude awakening was discovering that paying extra 
for first-class tickets meant nada. It didn't guarantee reserved seating, as 
one would expect. Sure, the seats in the so-called "Custom Class" are a bit 
wider and the legroom marginally better, but it's not worth the extra $12. 
</P>
<P>
 The only seats we could find together were in the last row, where we were 
forced to sit face to face and knee to knee with two other passengers. To two 
work-weary souls who just wanted to read and talk to each other, the loud and 
chatty guys who wanted to flirt sent us bolting for an alternative seating 
arrangement. We ultimately found two seats together after a sweet teen-ager 
offered up hers. We discovered that people on trains are a lot friendlier than 
the often-cranky drivers on the freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 When we arrived with too much luggage, we decided that instead of schlepping 
six minutes up the hill to our hotel, we would call a taxi. One of our other 
"slips" was choosing an out-of-town restaurant to dine in Saturday night, which 
required a 20-minute cab ride. But, those notwithstanding, we kept to our 
weekend pledge to be car-less. 
</P>
<P>
 A chummy cabby took us up to our historic B&B, the Rock Haus Inn, a 1911 white 
clapboard house overlooking the Pacific in a hilly, wooded residential 
neighborhood two blocks from the beach. We had discovered the inn -- which 
bills itself as "Del Mar's Only Bed & Breakfast in the Village," on an earlier 
visit when we stayed at the plush L'Auberge Resort and Spa on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Since we would be arriving after dinner Friday, our innkeeper, Doris Holmes, 
left our key in the brochure box at the front door. We had booked what we 
thought would be the best of the 10 guest rooms, the Huntsman, because it was 
the only unit with a fireplace and one of two with its own entrance. After 
surveying the other rooms (six rooms in the main house share three bathrooms -- 
no thanks!), we agreed it was the pick of the lot despite the lack of an ocean 
view, which most of the others had. Although the decor was kind of hokey -- 
done up in the red, white and green colors of a traditional fox hunt, with a 
plaid goose-down comforter -- it wasn't nearly as contrived as the 
theme-decorated rooms like Top O' the Rock, the Whale Watch, the Cabana, the 
Court Room or the Wren's Nest. 
</P>
<P>
 The main drag, Camino Del Mar, winds along a ridge of sloping hills set 
against the ocean, boasting blocks of attractive shops, restaurants and a 
historic library in a Craftsman-style home -- a reminder of what the village 
must have looked like in earlier days. The Art Deco Del Mar race track and 
fairgrounds -- which attracted Hollywood's elite when it opened in 1937 at the 
height of the Depression -- is about a mile north of the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday night, we had a delicious dinner at Il Fornaio, located on the top 
level of the Del Mar Plaza -- a classy collection of eateries and shops that 
defies the mall concept with its innovatively designed spaces, lighting, 
waterways and outdoor patios with spectacular ocean views. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting on the restaurant's patio, sharing pizza, pasta and salad and 
breathing in the fresh sea air, Amy and I agreed we had found the perfect way 
to begin our weekend. The next morning, instead of eating at our B&B (breakfast 
is included), we had brunch at an informal restaurant on the beach, Poseidon, 
which friends from L.A. had recommended. Other than being overcharged for two 
beers we didn't order and mediocre food, it again was a great setting for just 
relaxing, reading the paper and people-watching. Sunday, we had a much better 
culinary experience at the Rock Haus, where, in the glass-enclosed sun room 
overlooking the ocean, we ate a self-served breakfast that included three kinds 
of home-baked breads, cakes, fresh fruit, cold cereals and freshly brewed 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 After our Saturday brunch, we took a walk north on Camino Del Mar to an 
open-air green market, which was teeming with locals buying and selling produce 
and fresh-cut flowers. We bought a bunch of fragrant white clover for the room 
(such a bargain at $1.50), then walked several more blocks to the Del Mar Cycle 
Works, where we rented bikes for our day. Then we headed north on the old Coast 
Highway. The weather could not have been more beautiful, the scenery more 
breathtaking, as we pedaled along the highway with the startling-blue Pacific 
at our side. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time we made it back to Del Mar and returned our bikes, it was nearly 
dark -- but not too dark to prevent us from joining the crowd of locals and 
tourists that gathers daily in the park on the bluffs at the foot of 15th 
Street for the ritual of watching the sunset. 
</P>
<P>
 We returned to our room to get ready for dinner. This is where we cheated 
again and called a cab for the out-of-town eatery, Delicias, in the exclusive 
enclave of Rancho Santa Fe, just northeast of Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 After a costly cab ride through the winding back roads of polo fields and 
glorious horse ranches, we arrived at the restaurant, whose country elegance 
perfectly reflects its affluent clientele. Seated on a partially enclosed patio 
with a Santa Fe-style hearth blazing, I had delicious grilled free-range 
chicken with Delicias fries. Amy equally enjoyed the grilled tuna au poivre 
with charred tomato salsa. Our sweet and attentive waiter forced us to eat 
something decadent for dessert that was exquisitely chocolaty. We ended the 
evening at the movies with a lousy, mindless comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, after a light breakfast at our inn Sunday, we bought a $12 
tennis-and-spa pass at the L'Auberge Del Mar hotel, played 1 1/2 hours of 
tennis on courts overlooking the ocean, took a sauna, and then checked out of 
the inn, leaving our bags to pick up later. We walked to the Cafe Del Mar just 
down the road and feasted on great grilled chicken breast sandwiches while 
sitting on the tree-shaded patio of the unpretentious ivy-covered restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 With only a little time left before our departure, we went to a great 
bookstore and coffeehouse, Esmeralda, at the Del Mar Plaza, where we hung out 
until it was time for the train back. Speaking of which, you might want to 
think about taking the train to Del Mar sooner rather than later. There's talk 
that Amtrak may abandon its direct service to Del Mar later this year, in favor 
of a more modern station to be built in nearby Solana Beach (five minutes 
north). The argument is that the Del Mar station is inefficient . . . 
ironically due to inadequate parking.

HIKING: SAN DIEGO COUNTY: HISTORIC SAN PASQUAL VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Pasqual Valley is a peaceful place, a pastoral lowland backed by dramatic 
granite foothills. For the most part, it has resisted San Diego's eastward 
suburban sprawl by virtue of its agricultural zoning. 
</P>
<P>
 The valley is an inviting place to hike, picnic and step back into California 
history. Hikers can follow easy pathways through San Pasqual Battlefield State 
Historic Park, and more challenging trails in nearby San Dieguito River Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The state historic park interprets the battle of San Pasqual -- a small 
conflict, but the most severe of the Mexican-American War fought on California 
soil. A modern visitor center and museum tell the story of the battle with 
maps, displays and a video. Other exhibits feature the history and natural 
history of the San Pasqual Valley. The park's short nature trail and 
Battlefield Monument Trail are also good introductions to the life and lore of 
San Pasqual Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, most valley visitors are en route to the San Diego Wild Animal Park, 
which surrounds the state park on three sides and whose entrance is 1 1/2 miles 
west. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Interstate 15 to Escondido, exit on California 78, and follow the road 
eight miles east to the turnoff for San Pasqual Battlefield State Historic 
Park. Leave your car in the lot by the visitor center, which is open Friday 
through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Join the nature trail, which begins on the hillside behind the visitor center. 
After a quarter-mile, you'll join Battlefield Monument Trail and ascend a slope 
bristling with prickly-pear cactus. 
</P>
<P>
 At a picnic area, you get an inspiring view of the wide San Pasqual Valley as 
well as a fine place to eat lunch. Sometimes you can see some of the larger 
animals roaming through the nearby Wild Animal Park. You can return to the 
visitor center the way you came, or continue another half-mile on Battlefield 
Monument Trail to a historic monument next to State 78. 
</P>
<P>
 For more challenging hiking and terrific valley views, drive four miles 
further east on 78 to the city of San Diego's San Dieguito River Park. Pull 
into the parking area on the south side of the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 This area of the park, known as the San Pasqual Trails, is divided by 78 into 
a south and north trail system. The south trail system is the easier of the 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 For a good panoramic view of the San Pasqual Valley, take the 2.6-mile round 
trip (900-foot elevation gain) to Peak 1550. From the signed trail head, ascend 
the boulder-strewn slope to a junction. Go right and continue your steep ascent 
to the peak. 
</P>
<P>
 To reach the north trail system, drive another half-mile east on 78. Look 
carefully for the unsigned parking lot and trail head on your left. Use caution 
when you make the sharp and awkward left turn into the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The northern San Pasqual Trails zigzag over steep slopes and offer the 
ambitious, switchback-loving hiker the opportunity for a 10- to 15-mile hike, 
as well as the chance to conquer half a dozen or more peaks. Battlefield 
Monument Trail, San Pasqual Trails 
</P>
<P>
 WHERE: San Pasqual Battlefield State Historic Park, near Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
 DISTANCE: Visitor center to overlook, 1 mile round trip; to monument, 2 miles 
round trip. 
</P>
<P>
 TERRAIN: Cactus-dotted slopes above San Pasqual Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 HIGHLIGHTS: Mexican-American War history; wild land on the edge of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY: Easy. 
</P>
<P>
 FOR MORE INFORMATION: Contact San Pasqual Battlefield State Historic Park, 
15808 San Pasqual Valley Road, Escondido 92025, (619) 220-5430.

BACKPACK & BUDGET; LANTAU: AN ISLAND ESCAPE IN HONG KONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's almost impossible not to feel as if you've reached the exotic Far East 
when you land on Lantau. Dominating the skyline of this island, which is only a 
one-hour ferry ride from Hong Kong Island, is the world's largest outdoor 
bronze statue of Buddha. The massive statue and its majestic staircase were 
completed in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong Island is one of 236 islands that, together with Lantau Island, the 
Kowloon Peninsula and the New Territories, make up Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong Island's population exceeds 1 million. When you need a break from 
its bustling atmosphere and jungle of high-rises, Lantau is an easy and 
inexpensive place to escape. It's twice the size of Hong Kong Island, but has 
only about 30,000 residents. It is, however, wise to schedule visits to Lantau 
on weekdays to avoid the weekend holiday crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 Lantau is known for its beaches, hiking trails and picturesque settings such 
as the stilt-house fishing village of Tai O. 
</P>
<P>
 The 112-foot, 250-ton Tian Tan Buddha is perched on a mountaintop above the Po 
Lin Monastery, a temple complex that is also a popular tourist stop. 
</P>
<P>
 The monastery (local telephone 985-5113) formerly had limited Spartan 
dormitories for travelers, who would spend the night so that they could catch a 
glimpse of the massive statue at sunrise. Accommodations are no longer 
available, but travelers may purchase vegetarian meals at the monastery. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget lodging is available to members of Hostelling International at the S. 
G. Youth Hostel, a five-minute walk from the temple complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers who decide to stay on Hong Kong Island or Kowloon can find out about 
budget accommodations at the Hong Kong Tourist Assn. information centers. 
There's one at the Star Ferry Concourse in Kowloon, and at Shop 8 Basement, 
Jardine House, 1 Connaught Place Central, Hong Kong Island. 
</P>
<P>
 The offices have information on budget accommodations in youth hostels, Y's, 
guest houses, budget hotels and backpackers' hostels (although you won't find 
the independent backpackers' hostels listed in official HKTA directories). 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong's student travel service has its own low-rise hostel for budget 
travelers, located close to the Temple Street Night Market. The STB Hostel is 
at 2/F Great Easter Mansion, 255-261 Reclamation St., Mong Kok, Kowloon, local 
phone 710-9199 or fax 385-0153. Dormitory beds are available for $8.40 per 
night. A double room costs $36, while triples are $42. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong is known for its inexpensive public transportation. The fast, 
efficient underground (which is air-conditioned) costs only from 40 cents to 
$1.10. A taxi from the airport to the STB hostel is about $3.50. One of the 
city's best buys is the scenic eight-minute Star Ferry service between Hong 
Kong and Kowloon for 20 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 For self-guided walking tours, the HKTA also publishes five booklets, sold at 
its information centers for $3, with detailed maps for fishing villages, 
antique shops, beaches and markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Information on events, including the colorful festivals, is available from the 
HKTA office in Los Angeles (address below). 
</P>
<P>
 For example, on May 18, the seven-day Cheung Chau Bun Festival begins. The 
highlight is a parade with lion dances, drum dances and decorated floats. The 
Dragon Boat Festival (June 13) is one of Hong Kong's most popular events. Stick 
around until Aug. 21 and you can experience Yue Land (the Hungry Ghost 
Festival). 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on Hong Kong, contact the Hong Kong Tourist Assn., 10940 
Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1220, Los Angeles 90024; tel. (310) 208-4582. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep in mind that there is an $18 airport tax charged when you fly out of the 
country, and you'll need to have it in local currency.

TAKING THE KIDS: LAS VEGAS: INSIDE THE NEW LAS VEGAS; GAMBOLING FOR CHILDREN; 
SIN CITY'S DRIVE TO ATTRACT FAMILIES TRANSLATES TO NEW VENUES FOR PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Be prepared. They're everywhere you go on The Strip these days, especially on 
weekends and holidays -- walking (or being carried) through the casinos, 
impatiently awaiting service in the restaurants, hogging the arcade games, 
sprawled on the floor in front of Gargantuan hotel check-in counters, noisily 
making their presence felt in even the elegant shops. 
</P>
<P>
 They're a new generation of visitors that hotel officials say is growing by 
the month. Kids -- from babies in strollers to 14-year-olds in oversize 
T-shirts and expensive high-tops -- have invaded Vegas . . . just as city 
officials promised they would. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no secret that Las Vegas hoteliers set out to lure families by creating 
resorts with facilities that children and non-gamblers could enjoy. But now, 
just a few months after three major family-friendly attractions opened, it 
appears that the experiment is already paying off. 
</P>
<P>
 With the opening of such kid-attractive hotels and resorts as the Treasure 
Island resort, where mock pirate battles are fought aboard a frigate in front 
of the hotel; the MGM Grand Hotel, Casino & Theme Park, the city's first theme 
park; the pyramid-shaped Luxor, with its futuristic, state-of-the-art Sega 
Virtualand game arcade, and Circus Circus' Grand Slam Canyon, complete with 
indoor roller coasters -- this most adult of cities is trying to sell itself as 
a destination resort, not just a place for gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 The openings have spurred an instant and dramatic demographic shift, startling 
even the experts here with its swiftness. At the 5,005-room MGM Grand on some 
weekends, half of those checking in have a child along, according to Dan 
Shumny, vice president of sales, while officials at the 2,900-room Treasure 
Island say as many as 40% do. Vegas hotel officials are also reporting that 
since the new family-friendly attractions have opened, many visitors are 
staying an extra night. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say that we should confuse Las Vegas with Disney World. 
Gambling is still what Vegas is about. "We're not selling the kids," Shumny 
said. "We're telling people that now it's OK to bring the kids and the 
grandkids." 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line, of course, is money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realized if we wanted to continue to be popular with adults, we had no 
choice but to recognize that they were going to bring the kids," said Treasure 
Island spokesman Alan Feldman. "Las Vegas was going to be left out of the 
kitchen-table vacation discussion if there was nothing for the kids to do." 
</P>
<P>
 But are the new attractions interesting to children? Accompanied by my 
10-year-old son, Matt, 7-year-old daughter, Reggie, and a local guide (my 
6-year-old nephew, Michael Fieldman), I set out to explore the new offerings. 
First stop: the 33-acre MGM Grand Adventures theme park, which more than 
170,000 people visited in its first month. 
</P>
<P>
 It is small compared to Disneyland -- just seven rides, one of which, the Deep 
Earth motion simulator (hyped as a wild journey to the Earth's core), will not 
open until spring. It also has five shows in four theaters spread across nine 
themed areas, in addition to restaurants and exhibitions designed to make 
visitors feel like they're on an old MGM lot. We easily walked from a New York 
street, where New York-style pretzels are sold, to the New Orleans area, where 
the Cotton Blossom Riverboat vends Cajun food. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the theme park, we all enjoyed the Backlot River Tour that took us on 
a riverboat cruise through several simulated movie sets. "All of a sudden a 
swamp monster pops up at you and then you go through a war zone and everything 
blows up," said Matt, summing up the experience. We also took the "Over the 
Edge" ride in log flumes through an old mining camp and over a water drop. 
Reggie rated the ride: "I liked it because it felt like we were really 
falling." 
</P>
<P>
 The kids also gave the shows we saw a thumbs up -- especially the live "Three 
Stooges" show produced by Moe Howard's grandson, Jeffrey Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 Even better, because the MGM has placed a cap on crowds -- no more than 7,500 
tickets are sold a day -- the lines weren't bad anywhere. Our longest wait was 
about 20 minutes for the indoor roller coaster Lightning Bolt. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt's favorite ride turned out to be the Lightning Bolt. "It's really 
realistic because you see all this stuff that looks like you're in space -- 
flashing lights and big drops." He also liked slamming into his sister on the 
Parisian Taxis bumper cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The MGM theme park is cute and plenty big to keep us amused for several hours. 
But I'd think twice about taking my preschooler there for an extended visit. 
Other than seeing the life-size characters of Popeye, Olive Oyl and Betty Boop, 
there isn't much of interest for the diaper set. 
</P>
<P>
 (Tickets may be purchased in advance for the theme park; call 800-929-1111. 
Admission until March 31 is $15 for adults, $10 for children ages 4 to 12. 
Senior citizens and children under 4 are free.) 
</P>
<P>
 When we had had enough rides, we walked through the new MGM casino (children 
aren't allowed to stay but families may pass through), gaping at its sheer 
size. We checked out the hotel's sparkling, 3,000-square-foot King Looey Youth 
Activity Center -- a day-care facility open to the 3- to 16-year-old children 
of hotel guests (child-care costs begin at $5 per hour). It had every toy 
imaginable, from Duplo building blocks for preschoolers to Ping-Pong and Super 
Nintendo for preteens. Open from 8 a.m to midnight, the center is staffed by an 
enthusiastic group of 25, chosen from 500 applicants. In just the first month, 
more than 1,000 kids took part in the programs. 
</P>
<P>
 On our way out, we stopped by the sparkling green, 75-foot-high Emerald City 
attraction in the hotel. Though "Wizard's Secret," the 15-minute, 
special-effects magic show, wasn't open during our visit ($3 entry fee for 
children and adults), we followed the Yellow Brick Road around Emerald City, 
encountering singing and talking animatronic Oz characters along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the hotel, my kids liked the Oz Midway and Arcade, a 
30,000-square-foot center, with 33 carnival games and a video arcade. 
</P>
<P>
 On to Treasure Island, which has a lot of kid appeal -- particularly Mutiny 
Bay, the hotel's 18,000-square-foot arcade full of the latest video, pinball 
and other electronic games. "Just one more quarter!" they pleaded in unison. 
They also admired skeletons (fake, of course) in stone alcoves in the wall, and 
treasure chests filled with mock gold pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 But we found the best action at the pirate village Buccaneer Bay. Here, on The 
Strip in front of the hotel, every 90 minutes beginning at 3 p.m. there's a 
mock sea battle played out between pirates and British naval officers aboard a 
full-scale frigate. Cannons are fired. Men fall overboard. The kids thought it 
was great entertainment. It's free, too. "Get there early," is Matt's 
recommendation, "otherwise you're stuck behind too many tall people." 
</P>
<P>
 He also liked Grand Slam Canyon, the climate-controlled, pink-glass domed 
amusement park that opened last summer behind Circus Circus. It contains 
30-foot-tall animated dinosaurs, an arcade filled with games, and fossil 
replicas. It also has a double-loop, double-corkscrew roller coaster, a water 
flume ride, two tubular slides, a replica of a stratified fossil wall, pretend 
tar pits with pretend dinosaur bones, and even a fake cliff dwelling of ancient 
Native Americans, as well as the obligatory restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt especially liked Hot Shots laser tag, played with non-injury-inducing 
laser guns in a black-lit room. My vote went to Rim Runner, a heart-stopping 
flume ride. (Rides are sold individually and cost from $1.50 to $2.50 each.) 
</P>
<P>
 At the Luxor, the 18,000-square-foot Virtualand arcade, featuring Sega 
Enterprises' most advanced games, was Matt and Michael's idea of heaven. (My 
13-year-old nephew from Orange County, who was there at another time, also gave 
it high marks.) 
</P>
<P>
 The pyramid-shaped Luxor hotel clearly is fun to look at. In its favor is one 
of Las Vegas' largest pools, as well as an indoor 3,000-feet-long River Nile 
that runs through the hotel. It is open to visitors, who can take a barge ride 
on it as guides give lectures on Egyptology ($3). Check out the beam of light 
that shines from the tip of the pyramid. On a clear night, hotel officials 
claim, it can be seen from a plane over Los Angeles. Of course, there's a 
replica of King Tut's tomb and a 10-story sphinx at the front entrance. But a 
series of three special-effects shows -- "In Search of the Obelisk," "The Luxor 
Live" and "Theater of Time" -- were too complex for smaller kids (and this mom) 
to understand. And at $13 for all three, each lasting about 30 minutes, were a 
bit pricey. 
</P>
<P>
 My kids wolfed their breakfast in a Luxor coffee shop and headed straight to 
the two-story arcade, where they would have been happy to stay all day. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt couldn't wait to get back to the arcade. But no one wanted to see King 
Tut's Tomb and Museum, a reproduction of King Tutankhamen's tomb as it was when 
it was discovered in Egypt in 1922 ($2). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all fake," Matt said, shrugging. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's Las Vegas," I replied.

DESTINATION: COLORADO; CITY OF OLYMPIC TRIBUTES; BUT HARDING SCANDAL IRONIC 
FOOTNOTE AT SKATING MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIBBY SLATE, Slate is a Los Angeles free-lance writer who has covered figure 
skating for two decades. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The costume is unremarkable by figure-skating standards: a long-sleeved, 
conservatively beaded light-aqua dress with a short skirt cut to resemble the 
petals of a flower. But it represents a most remarkable moment in 
figure-skating history: It was the costume worn by Tonya Harding at the 1991 
United States National Figure Skating Championships, when she became the first 
U.S. woman ever to perform a triple-axel jump in competition. 
</P>
<P>
 As I stood last summer before the case displaying that costume, at the World 
Figure Skating Museum and Hall of Fame in Colorado Springs, I could never have 
imagined that the woman who wore it would soon become the center of a scandal 
that has turned world attention on the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum contains nothing of her rival Nancy Kerrigan, whom Harding will 
duel for Olympic gold this Wednesday and Friday. Kerrigan, of course, is the 
1992 Olympic bronze medalist who was whacked in the knee at this year's 
National Championships in Detroit in a plot Harding's former husband has 
admitted to masterminding along with, he alleges, Harding herself. With the 
media frenzy that the Kerrigan attack has produced, not only die-hard 
figure-skating fans like myself but people who previously did not know a triple 
axel from a car axle might find some fascination with this museum. 
</P>
<P>
 And, for those caught up in the Olympic spirit after watching the Winter Games 
in Lillehammer, Norway, the skating museum is only one of a number of sporting 
sites to see here. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the United States Figure Skating Assn., the sport's governing 
body, and located on two floors at USFSA headquarters, the museum may be the 
only institution in the world devoted exclusively to all aspects of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 For skating fans, the museum is an "ooh and ah" kind of place. But even 
visitors not interested in skating may be intrigued. There is interesting 
history in the museum's Skate Gallery where, for example, skates made of cow 
and sheep bones, dating back to the 8th Century, are on view. The World and 
United States Hall of Fame galleries, with their trophies and photographic 
plaques, detail the accomplishments of skating greats. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on display are more than 20 versions of "Hans Brinker and the Silver 
Skates," perhaps the best-known skating story in the world, along with an 
assortment of other novels, magazines and show programs. A video plays skating 
highlights from ABC continuously. 
</P>
<P>
 The art exhibits begin with a life-size bronze sculpture of Britain's Patricia 
Dodd, former star of the John Curry Skating Co., at the entrance. It was 
donated by its sculptor, Stanley Taub, but the bulk of the artwork on display 
is from the "Skating in Art" collection of Swedish skater Gillis Grafstrom, a 
1920s Olympic champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Grafstrom's extensive assemblage of skating-related art, figurines, porcelain, 
silver, crystal, antique skates and other historical items is exhibited 
throughout the museum. Among older holdings are a calendar print, circa 1580, 
and a 1784 copper engraving of a Massachusetts River ice sports scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the world's most renowned skaters merit their own sections, with 
photos and memorabilia. One is Brian Boitano, the 1988 Olympic champion from 
Northern California who returned to amateur competition this season after six 
years as a professional. He came in second at the U.S. Nationals in January, 
and on Saturday was scheduled to make his second bid for Olympic gold. On 
display is a mannequin bearing the costume, a scarlet and blue military-style 
outfit, that Boitano wore at the 1988 games. 
</P>
<P>
 A tribute to 1984 Olympic gold medal winner Scott Hamilton features his 
Olympic and World Championship medals, red-and-blue Olympic skating costume, 
Olympic team member certificate, a Senate citation and trophies won as an 
amateur and a professional. 
</P>
<P>
 Three-time Olympic champion, Norwegian skater Sonja Henie, who won movie 
stardom in the late 1930s and '40s, is represented in a display of Madame 
Alexander dolls that more closely resemble Shirley Temple. And there are photos 
galore, plus Henie's last pair of skates and final exhibition costume. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, the highlight of the museum was the costumes, beginning with 
Boitano's. Other favorites were the navy-blue attire of surprise 1992 Olympic 
silver medalist Paul Wylie, the striking black-and-red "Carmen" dress worn by 
Debi Thomas when she won the 1988 Olympic bronze, and the simple, powder-blue, 
rainbow-themed exhibition outfits of Los Angeles' 1979 World Champions, Tai 
Babilonia and Randy Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
 In sharp contrast to these happy reminders, one exhibit brought tears. It was 
the tribute to the 1961 World Figure Skating Team, whose members, along with 
coaches, officials, family and friends, died in a plane crash in Brussels en 
route to the World Championships in Prague. Four were Los Angeles-area skaters. 
Photos, medals and costumes pay tribute to promises unfulfilled, and a memorial 
book contains expressions of sympathy from skaters and devotees around the 
world, beginning with President John F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum also hosts changing special exhibits, such as the one on view 
through March: a collection tracing Olympic figure skating from 1908, when the 
sport was introduced during the Summer Games in London. Another exhibit, 
featuring the work of well-known skating photographer Paul Harvath, continues 
through August. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum may have been a figure-skating mecca for me, but it was just the 
first stop on my pilgrimage. From there, I took the 10-minute walk south to the 
Broadmoor Hotel to check out the skating at the legendary Broadmoor World 
Arena. And not a moment too soon: The venerable rink has been the site of six 
previous U.S. and five World Championship events, and the 1994 World Junior 
Championships held last December. It was also the training home of 1968 Olympic 
champion Peggy Fleming. Sadly, the historic rink will close March 15 for 
demolition to make way for a new addition to the resort hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, the legacy of more than 50 years of competitions and training sessions 
was almost palpable. Practicing on this particular July day were 1994 Olympic 
contender and 1993 and '94 U.S. men's champion Scott Davis, who regularly 
trains here, and this year's Olympic silver medalists, pair skaters Natalia 
Mishkutienok and Artur Dmitriev of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Figure skating isn't the only sport celebrated here. The city, is, after all, 
the site of the largest of three U.S. Olympic training centers, which, in turn, 
house the U.S. Olympic Committee, the governing body for the Olympic and Pan 
American Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Established in 1978 at the behest of then-President Gerald Ford, who was 
dismayed by U.S. athletes' poor showing at the 1976 Olympics, the center hosts 
about 17,000 athletes per year, usually for one or two weeks. I took a one-hour 
tour of the 36-acre complex, formerly a U.S. Air Force base and NORAD 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, even I, who despise boxing, was impressed by the pageantry of the 
brightly colored boxing rings, with their bags and mirrors for shadow boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a glass wall adjoining the boxing area, I could see a large gymnasium, 
complete with television lighting, which can be divided into three gyms for any 
of 13 Olympic events, including gymnastics, volleyball and basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Our next stop was the Shooting Center, which claims to be the largest indoor 
gun-shooting facility in the Western Hemisphere. In the lobby were 
shooting-related artworks, among them a bronze sculpture of an arrow-toting 
goddess, and a Korean crown -- trophies from national competitions. We learned 
the finer points of the sport while observing junior-level shooters wearing 
jackets and gloves, we were told, to muffle their heartbeats so they would not 
be distracted by the sound. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour ends at the gift shop, jampacked with Olympic-logo merchandise, with 
proceeds benefiting athletes. Each tour participant receives a glossy, 
photo-laden book detailing Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
 I had planned the Olympic Training Center as the end of my sports trek, but I 
was mistaken. At the summit of 14,110-foot Pikes Peak, just outside the city, I 
discovered a granite monument erected by the U.S. Olympic Committee with the 
names of all Olympic athletes who have trained in Colorado Springs. Seeing this 
tribute, set against the vistas that in 1893 had inspired Katherine Lee Bates 
to write the lyrics to "America the Beautiful," proved a truly grand finale to 
my pilgrimage. GUIDEBOOK: An Ice Time in Colorado 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: Several airlines offer direct or connecting (but no nonstop) 
service to Colorado Springs. Morris Air has the least-expensive, 
advance-purchase round-trip fare: $178. America West, Continental, United and 
Delta also fly there. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to stay: Numerous accommodations are available, from the deluxe to 
cabins and hostels. The ultimate is the Broadmoor, an elegant resort with its 
own lake set against a mountain backdrop. Double occupancy rates now through

CRUISE VIEWS: LIKE ITS NAMESAKE, MARCO POLO IS AN EXPLORER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH, Slater and Basch travel as guests of the 
cruise lines. Cruise Views appears the first and third week of every month.

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was hard to tell who was enjoying the evening more, the Marco Polo's 
passengers or the exuberant Zulu dance troupe from the Valley of the Thousand 
Hills in KwaZulu, which was brought on to entertain them. 
</P>
<P>
 One signature detail of the new Orient Lines is to present local folkloric 
performers in as many ports of call as possible. Passengers on this sailing 
also had the chance to applaud the National Folkloric Dancers of Zanzibar, a 
Kenyan dance troupe, and a dazzling company of Cape Town performers reminiscent 
of New Orleans parade bands -- in gold and shocking pink satin with twirling 
umbrellas. 
</P>
<P>
 Orient is a brand-new cruise line founded by British entrepreneur Gerry 
Herrod, former chairman of Ocean Cruise Lines and Pearl Cruises. Herrod's 
800-passenger Marco Polo is a major make-over of the Alexandr Pushkin, built in 
Germany in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a series of spring sailings in Australia and New Zealand, the Marco 
Polo will cruise between Singapore and Hong Kong May 11 (and again Oct. 2), 
calling in Vietnam, Malaysia and China, with three nights in Bangkok and three 
nights in Hong Kong also included. China, Japan and the islands of Indonesia 
are among the ship's summer destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 When we joined the ship in Durban last Dec. 2, five days before the end of the 
cruise, a lot of work remained on the outer decks, including laying new teak 
areas and making the spa tubs operational. Strikes in Greece had delayed the 
scheduled completion of the vessel and forced the cancellation of its original 
inaugural voyage, from Piraeus, Greece, to Mombasa, Kenya, planned for Oct. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The passengers we joined had boarded in Mombasa Nov. 19 after a three-day 
safari in Kenya, and had already visited Tanzania, the Comoros, Madagascar, the 
Seychelles, Reunion and Mauritius. 
</P>
<P>
 But, for all of us, South Africa was the most-anticipated destination. With 
the lifting of international sanctions, the abolishment of apartheid, the 
recent adoption of a new constitution, and the upcoming "one man, one vote" 
April elections, it meant a chance to see a country on the brink of astonishing 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 Marco Polo the explorer journeyed to China in the 14th Century and returned to 
Italy with, among other things, pasta. Our cruise vessel Marco Polo was 
carrying two California cuisine signature dinners from famed Los Angeles chef 
Wolfgang Puck. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship's public rooms are faintly Art Deco in design and quite chic, 
especially the black-and-white Casino Bar with its framed black-and-white 
photographs of Fred Astaire and Ingrid Bergman. The small casino provides 
roulette, blackjack and slot machines for passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 A splendid collection of Oriental art and antiques decorates the public areas. 
Outstanding is a stone Buddha at the entrance of the dining room on a 
glass-and-marble base. 
</P>
<P>
 The central meeting place is the handsome Polo Lounge, adorned with potted 
palms, antique art objects and leaf-patterned carpet and banquettes. Pianist 
David Perry alternates here with the Cafe Concerto, a classical Romanian string 
trio. In the main show lounge (sight lines are weak because the floor is nearly 
the same level as the stage), a company of singers and dancers which doubles as 
cruise staff perform musical revues and variety shows. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also a special grill room dinner offered some evenings in the 
alternative Raffles restaurant. About 75 passengers with reservations, who pay 
a $5-per-person surcharge to tip the servers, can feast on Italian specialties 
from an Italian Guide Michelin one-star chef, Donatella Zampoli. 
</P>
<P>
 Our cabin was in the mid-range price D category, about $250 a day per person, 
double occupancy, including some air fare, with twin beds, a large single 
window, TV set with remote control, double dresser with eight drawers, and a 
handsome rose-colored carpet with matching bedspreads and curtains. Closet 
hanging space was generous. 
</P>
<P>
 Top accommodations are six suites, two of them deluxe and four called junior 
suites, that cost about $350 to $400 a day per person, double occupancy. All 
the suites have sitting areas and marble bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 131 inside cabins and 288 outside, all spacious enough for comfort, 
beginning at $185 a day per person, double occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marco Polo returns to South Africa in November for a 20-day itinerary from 
Mombasa to Cape Town that includes a three-day safari in Kenya and two 
overnights in Cape Town with the ship as the hotel. The tour departs the United 
States Nov. 25 and returns from Cape Town Dec. 14; prices range from $3,995 to 
$10,500 per person, double occupancy, plus an air add-on of $895 from Los 
Angeles. The cruise-only credit for passengers wishing to provide their own air 
fare is $900.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: INSIDE THE NEW LAS VEGAS; FEW CASINO DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hotel discounts for seniors in Las Vegas are rare. Though a survey 
commissioned last year by the Clark County Convention and Visitors Authority 
revealed that nearly half of all visitors to Las Vegas are age 50 or older, the 
thinking is that competition alone seems to keep prices to a minimum. Still, 
some resorts and casinos occasionally offer special incentives. Because of the 
gaming mecca's popularity, it is always wise to call in advance to confirm 
discount programs and reservations. Some highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Stardust Resort and Casino, in the center of the Las Vegas Strip, is 
offering a Senior Spring Fling package for members of the American Assn. of 
Retired Persons. Room rates in the Stardust's Motor Inn are $28 per night, 
double occupancy, or $38 in the new Tower. Bonus features of the Spring Fling, 
at no additional charge, include two free tickets to two of the resort's their 
popular shows. One is "Enter the Night," which normally costs $24.95 per person 
and includes two cocktails; the other is its afternoon show, "Star Odyssey," 
usually $4.95 per person. Guests also receive $16 in discounts at the 
Stardust's all-you-can-eat buffet, and each person receives the Stardust's 
casino fun book, which has coupons for food, beverage, souvenirs and gaming 
discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The offer is valid until April 30, and reservations are required. Present your 
AARP membership card upon registering at the hotel. For information and 
reservations, call (800) 824-6033. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Imperial Palace has a new tower, bringing its room total to 2,700. It 
also has one of the world's largest collections of antique and classic

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 SOUTHEAST (American Automobile Assn., 60 minutes, 1992).  
</P>
<P>
 This tour of three of America's southeastern states -- North and South 
Carolina and Georgia -- is beautifully photographed and crammed with 
information on major industrial, cultural and historic sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The video begins with scenes of North Carolina's Outer Banks that include Cape 
Hatteras National Seashore; Roanoke Island, where the first British settlements 
were made (1585 and 1587), and Kill Devil Hills' monument to the Wright 
Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving inland, the video explores North Carolina's capital city of Raleigh, 
which, along with nearby Chapel Hill and Durham, constitutes the huge Research 
Triangle Institute, a well-known scientific research center. 
</P>
<P>
 The far western area of the state is a vacationland that includes the scenic 
Blue Ridge Mountain Parkway to the Great Smoky Mountains and the city of 
Asheville, home of author Thomas C. Wolfe and site of the elegant Biltmore 
Estate. 
</P>
<P>
 South Carolina features a tour of Charleston, with its regal old homes and 
numerous historic churches, cemeteries and museums. Also visited in the harbor 
area are Ft. Sumter, Ft. Moultrie, Patriots' Point and the aircraft carrier, 
Yorktown. A visit to the capital city of Columbia offers views of the Trinity 
Episcopal Cathedral and lovely homes and gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the coast, viewers get a look at the resort areas of Myrtle Beach and 
Hilton Head Island. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour of Georgia concentrates on the cities of Atlanta and Savannah, and 
the many sites related to the Civil War. Atlanta, rebuilt after the war, is the 
site of has numerous battlefields and museums. Also featured is a look at the 
memorial to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and the Carter Presidential Center. 
Farther south is Franklin D. Roosevelt's Little White House at Warm Springs. 
There's also a visit east of Atlanta to Stone Mountain, the world's largest 
granite monolith. 
</P>
<P>
 The highway to Savannah from Atlanta passes through Macon and the Ocmulgee 
National Monument, site of vast excavations of indigenous settlements. 
</P>
<P>
 In Savannah, viewers hear about the role the city played in the Revolutionary 
and Civil wars, while the film shows scenes of the historic waterfront area, 
the Ships of the Sea Maritime Museum and the beautiful residential area. Just 
east of Savannah is Ft. Pulaski National Monument, and, on the border with 
Florida, the video visits the Okefenokee Swamp and wildlife park.

 TOURING ITALY (Questar Video Inc., 60 minutes, 1993).  
</P>
<P>
 With maps, history-filled narration and a look at the wondrous works of art 
and architecture, this video offers viewers a wonderfully filmed tour of Italy, 
"the living museum." 
</P>
<P>
 The tour of Naples includes the home of Enrico Caruso. Viewers see and hear 
old film and recordings of the tenor, tour the ghostly ruins of Pompeii, and 
drive the Amalfi Coast through Sorrento, overlooking the isle of Capri. 
</P>
<P>
 Off the toe of Italy there are scenes of the island of Sicily and a visit to 
the resort city of Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
 In Northern Italy, the video tours Bologna, then visits Padua and Verona, both 
reflecting a Shakespearean connection. In Venice, scenes include the glittering 
bay, its many islands, canals, bridges, plus the opera house, Piazza San Marco 
and Rialto Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers can see mountain climbers in the Italian Alps, visit beautiful Lake 
Como and the fashion and business center of Milan. Here, scenes and narration

Benito Mussolini, who was both born and executed in Milan. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the northwestern coast, scenes cover the Riviera resort towns, with 
stops at the sidewalk cafes of Portofino and at Christopher Columbus' home in 
Genoa. 
</P>
<P>
 The video then heads south to the Chianti vineyards and the cultural 
attractions of Florence, including scenes of the Uffizi Gallery, the 
magnificent Duomo and Michelangelo's David in the Accademia Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 The video winds up with a tour of Rome and the nearby areas of Tivoli and 
Ostia. In Rome, viewers see many of the historical sites, shops, piazzas and

MEMORIES OF 'THE DEL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article about the Hotel Del Coronado ("Birthday Suite," Jan. 30) brought 
back unforgettable memories of the two nights my husband and I spent there in 
April, 1992, on our 50th anniversary. For almost 45 years, every time we went 
to San Diego we made a habit of going over to the Del just to walk around and 
admire this great old hotel.But we never stayed there until our anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 When we told the desk clerk it was our 50th, he surprised us by giving us a 
suite at the same price as the one room we had reserved. That gracious gesture 
and the champagne the management sent to our room and the beautiful basket of 
flowers our children sent us made that one of the happiest times Joe and I have 
ever had.

ONE THAT GOT AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a former longtime resident of San Diego and a fish taco devotee, I read 
with great interest your article entitled "Scaling Back" (Jan. 16). However, I 
feel compelled to point out that the article neglected to mention what are 
arguably the best fish tacos in San Diego, if not the world.These fish tacos 
can be found at the Brigantine chain of restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite Brigantine is the one in Old Town, which also has a great Sunday 
night happy hour, when you can get both a fish taco and an excellent margarita 
for $3.25. Until I moved to Monterey (where I have yet to find a good fish 
taco), the Brigantine Sunday night happy hour was a regular meeting place for 
myself, my friends and our out-of-town visitors.

DESERT LOVERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "Poolside in Palm Springs" (Jan. 30): 
</P>
<P>
 Those of us who reside in the beautiful desert love it all and welcome guests 
to show off the loveliness of it all.Although your article was interesting, it 
catered to the jet-set crowd, those who can well afford room rates of 
astronomical numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not have a follow-up story that shows where the average traveler can go 
and still have money left over for dining out? Please understand that I'm not 
taking away anything from the places named in your article. It's just, who can 
afford them?

THROUGH THE MORAL LOOKING GLASS; JUST WHAT DOES SPORTS SAY ABOUT SOCIETY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD RODRIGUEZ, Richard Rodriguez, an editor at Pacific News Service, is 
the author of Days of Obligation (Viking). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By the time the Winter Olympics began last week, many Americans said they were 
fed up -- fed up to here! -- with news about Tonya Harding and lawsuits and 
Tonya's ex- husband and his band of goons. People said the media's attention on 
Tonya was unfair to the "real athletes" gathered in Norway. Let the games 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
 On TV and the sports pages, there were faces of kids who were "good sports" -- 
good losers and humble winners, with straight teeth and nice smiles. But who 
could watch the Olympics these days without thinking of Harding? 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not she wins a medal, whether we will know in a year what has 
become of her, Harding has denied Americans a certain innocence about the way 
we regard athletes and athletics. Americans may not believe in very much any 
more, but Americans want to believe in sports. Who cares if the President is a 
Lothario or if the parish priest is a pederast? What troubles Americans is the 
guilt of Pete Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 It's only a game, parents tell kids. But what a game! Mama goes berserk when 
the Little League umpire makes a bad call; Papa gives up his job to train his 
daughter to be a great tennis star. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't we also believe that the game "builds character"? A century ago, the 
Duke of Wellington modestly proposed that "the Battle of Waterloo was won on 
the playing fields of Eton." He meant, I think, that boys become men playing 
rugby. Boys (upper-class British school boys, that is) become leaders, gain 
assurance, are schooled to excellence and gentlemanly rules of the game, by 
tossing around a ball in the mud. 
</P>
<P>
 The notion of "pure athletics" comes from the upper class. It is a notion that 
relies on leisure. The best footballer at Eton, after all, does not sign a 
contract after graduation to play for Manchester United before cheering 
skinheads on Saturday afternoons. The best footballer at Eton plays instead, we 
like to say, for the pure joy of playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Many middle-class Americans probably share this elitist romance about sports, 
the belief that money ruins sports. We liked baseball players more when they 
got little money and played before wooden bleachers where there were no "luxury 
boxes" or prowling sports agents. Isn't that why we like a sport like the luge 
-- because it is so removed from the grasp of agents and Nike endorsements? 
</P>
<P>
 Ask middle-class Americans (in private) and what many will tell you is sports 
are being ruined by too many poor kids, too many Tonyas who grew up in trailer 
courts, too many little black kids, too many kids with bad teeth who don't know 
the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, there is something about the level playing field that moves us. We are, 
after all, people who believe in fair play. Where better to see it enacted than 
on a field under the reassuring scrutiny of instant replay? We are people who 
believe in equal opportunity. Individual talent, not Etonian heritage, rules on 
American Sunday afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the greatest achievements of our national life was the racial 
integration of baseball. Baseball may have been only a game, but Americans 
realized the exclusion of blacks was too damning an indictment of our real 
lives and a distortion of our ideals. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, feminists have rightly demanded their share of school 
athletic facilities. Feminists understand, too, as Americans must, the glamour 
that attaches to the athlete. The athlete is strong; the athlete is individual; 
the athlete is the best of America. Some feminists I know have gone positively 
giddy over the Evian ads showing sweaty lady joggers, and the running-shoe 
pronouncements -- Your Time Has Come! 
</P>
<P>
 One could not help but hear the silence from middle-class feminists these last 
few weeks during the Harding controversy. Didn't they have anything to say 
about the plucky girl who scraped and clawed to make it onto the ice? Or was 
the Evian ad only about nice girls with good teeth? 
</P>
<P>
 In the 19th Century, while the boys at Eton were playing rugby, slum kids who 
spoke a London Cockney were becoming prizefighters. What a violation of the 
ideal of pure sport, prizefighting. Not what the Duke of Wellington had in 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya's complaint is that the figure-skating Establishment is rigged -- an 
upper-middle-class conspiracy of nice ladies and silver-haired gentleman. Poor 
kids will tell you -- if you bother to ask -- that sports are not pure, but are 
as real as the lady in the unemployment office or the cop. Kids will tell you 
that, beneath all the platitudes, "the game" in America is about winning. Al 
Davis expects you to win. Disney expects you to win. Adidas expects you to win. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last few weeks, the Campbell Soup Co. has been running an ad with 
Nancy Kerrigan that is meant to capitalize on her image as Snow White. There 
she is on TV with her dazzling smile, skating nonchalantly into a cluster of 
male hockey players. She ends up tossing a few guys off their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The values of our society become the values of sports -- not the other way 
around. If in real life we admire the winner, if in real life we admire the 
woman who pushes her way through a group of men, then in sports we will not 
remember the good loser. 
</P>
<P>
 In the age of Tonya, athletes take steroids. Athletes know how to play dirty 
to win. In the age of Tonya, America loves its athletes to be big and mean. 
Mothers trusted their sons to Woody Hayes. Or how about the basketball coach 
from Temple University who lunged at the opposing team's coach last week, 
screaming, "I'll kill you"? 
</P>
<P>
 Sissies never got picked in gym class. Or else we got picked at the end, and 
nobody paid us much mind when we got behind the gym and had a smoke. Sissies 
laughed at the coach, with his bark and bluster. Sissies rolled their eyes when 
the coach made one of his inspirational speeches. Sissies had thin legs and 
arms, but we always knew it was stupid -- a neo-Platonic fallacy -- to expect 
the playing field to be our moral teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not saying athletics are morally useless. Children can learn dedication 
to a goal, a notion of excellence, discipline, camaraderie on the playing 
field. But sports do not make the adult. Parents, teachers, neighbors, coaches 
and entire communities' values -- shape the child, teach the child how to use 
athletic skills. 
</P>
<P>
 If our athletes are turning out to be moral cripples, it is because the real 
world beyond the playing field is morally crippled. On the other hand, there 
are athletes like Duncan Kennedy. Kennedy became famous for defending a black 
team mate against some German neo-Nazies a few months ago. If we regard him as 
a moral hero now, it is not because of his skill in the luge, but because of 
the kind of man he is off the playing field. 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympics are a neo-pagan celebration. The eternal flame. Young, strong 
bodies. The "best" of their generation, pursued by agents and TV correspondents 
with orange hair. The neo-Platonic myth is that the strong body is evidence of 
moral heroism. 
</P>
<P>
 But if we have nothing else to learn from Harding, then let it be this -- she 
has reminded us that there is nothing intrinsically moral about being a 
brilliant athlete. And maybe, just maybe, the moral failures of our athletes 
should embarrass all of us watching at home.*

THE NATION; TO THE GOP'S DISMAY, THE REAL CLINTON EMERGES -- AS A 
NON-IDEOLOGICAL BLUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kevin Phillips, Kevin Phillips, publisher of the American Political Report, 
is author of The Politics of Rich and Poor. His most recent book is Boiling 
Point: Republicans, Democrats and the Decline of Middle-Class Prosperity 
(Random House). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The recent change in Bill Clinton's political fortunes represents: a) gains 
from his new sounding-like-a-Republican crime, welfare and budget policies; b) 
losses in Febru ary poll ratings after further developments in Whitewater and 
other Arkansas-related scandals; c) favorable public reaction to better news on 
the economy; d) uncertainty about his get-tough tack with Japan, or e) all the 
above? 
</P>
<P>
 The best answer is "e) all the above" -- and it's a confusing set of 
crosscurrents. Today's reality is that Clinton is both weaker and stronger than 
he appears, and the politics of 1994 -- and perhaps also 1996 -- will be 
confused accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 The notion of Clinton as a blurry, non-ideological centrist is gaining ground 
-- with good reason. Talk that he now sounds like a Republican on issues like 
welfare reform and crime is an exaggeration voiced most easily by liberals who 
know few Republicans. But his crime policies -- from lifetime incarcera- tion 
for three-time violent felons to advocacy of 100,000 added policemen -- do 
represent a significant shift for a Democratic President. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever Clinton sounds like -- committed centrist or talented opportunist -- 
what he no longer sounds like is clear: the type of liberal Democrat who 
Americans started getting tired of in the 1960s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the great benefit for Clinton-era Democrats. They are free to take 
middle-of-the-road, even moderately conservative positions on crime, federal 
spending cuts and welfare reform. This is tough for the GOP, because Democrats 
have stopped being a liberal-caricature opposition and started taking 
reasonable positions on issues the GOP used to dominate. The result is that 
Republicans, who started losing domestic- and economic-policy credibility 
during the Bush years, in January actually found themselves trailing the 
Democrats as the better party to handle crime, welfare reform and reducing the 
budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Health-care reform, meanwhile, has become an unexpected yellow light for the 
Democrats. True, they have a large lead in the polls as the better party to 
deal with health-care reform, but that is in the abstract. The actual Clinton 
health plan, designed back in the 1993 period of Hillary and Bill Clinton's 
ambitions for a bigger role of government, has been losing support. 
</P>
<P>
 When first announced last fall, national polls showed Clinton's program had a 
lopsided 65% support to 25% opposition. But by early 1994, as doubt about its 
bureaucracy and costs grew, pollsters found a standoff: Supporters and 
opponents more or less balanced each other, and the all-important middle class 
was tilting toward disapproval. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, health reform, which Democrats had counted as their high-scoring 
issue, was turning out not to be. Swing voters were beginning to think the 
Clinton program was too ambitious, that it raised as many problems as it 
answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming that Clinton and Congress produce a compromise health-care package 
this year, the President should still profit. But even this proposal must be 
qualified by the evidence of a new global political reality. Many welfare 
states that expanded in the 1970s and even the 1980s -- Britain, Canada, 
Scandinavia and Germany, for example -- are now retrenching. Too many people 
are finding services reduced or new charges imposed -- or both. Fewer 
governments are finding health coverage a winning issue, and the Clinton White 
House may ultimately count itself in this group. 
</P>
<P>
 The other big question mark with an increasingly negative tilt for the 
President is his collection of alleged Arkansas scandals -- ranging from the 
Madison Guaranty-Whitewater land deal to the charges of sexual misconduct made 
by two Arkansas state troopers. Several women have come forward to confirm the 
troopers' account, and Whitewater special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. has taken 
office space in Little Rock on a lease that runs through January, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans are excited at the prospect that both these issues -- and, with 
them, Clinton's ethics and alleged untrustworthiness -- could be major 
undertows working against him in the 1996 race. This could be important, 
because when Iran-Contra charges echoed against George Bush in the last days of 
the 1992 campaign, they cut short a Bush resurgence. Republicans may have the 
same thing in mind for Clinton in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 They are certainly going to need all the help they can get. Not only has 
Clinton's move to the center preempted several once-Republican themes, but also 
the GOP has a number of other emerging weaknesses. First, like many parties out 
of power after a long period of rule, it doesn't have much of an agenda.  
</P>
<P>
 Second, the GOP could gain enough seats in Congress in November's elections to 
get blamed for what could be 1995-96 gridlock. Meanwhile, strains between their 
leaders -- Bob Dole of Kansas in the Senate, Newt Gingrich of Georgia in the 
House -- could add to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there's the lack of any strong GOP presidential nominee for 1996, 
coupled with significant ideological splits in the party and the possibility of 
a second independent presidential bid by Ross Perot. These GOP weaknesses -- 
all hard to correct -- count as pluses for Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time, any assessment of the President's circumstances must 
take several points into account. His job ratings, which hit 60% last month, 
have dropped into the mid-to-low 50s, and one recent Newsweek poll had him 
slipping to 49%. The public remains standoffish toward Clinton, and, in the 
next three years, two issues now relatively quiet -- the economy and the perils 
of U.S. foreign policy -- are likely to come to the fore. Right now, both are 
"X factors." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no doubt that the improving economy has been a boon to Clinton, 
helping to pull his ratings up from the high 30s in some polls and the low 40s 
in others. Too many people forget, though, that a similar economic surge in 
late 1992 raised Bush's ratings from the high 30s on Election Day in November 
to the mid-50s in January as he prepared to retire. Part of Clinton's gain over 
the last three months could be just as shallow -- especially if the economy 
starts to sag again. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a possibility no Democrat strategist can ignore. But in a few weeks, 
believe it or not, our current economic recovery -- it officially started back 
in March, 1991 -- will be entering its fourth year . In other words, we may not 
be looking at economic or cyclical springtime; because the typical postwar 
business cycle has lasted 3 1/2 to 5 years, we could now be looking at some 
pleasant autumn economic weather, with a possible winter chill not too far off. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, there are some specific cautions to keep in mind. Experts worry that 
the huge amount of money put into mutual funds over the last few years has 
created a stock-market bubble, while others are now concerned that the 
possibility of a trade war between the United States and Japan could wind up 
damaging the international financial structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The second "X factor" that should haunt the Democrats is the unpredictability 
of international affairs and the possibility of some debacle linked to 
America's declining power to control overseas events. Democrats have particular 
reason to be nervous, because three of the last four Democratic Presidents left 
office in disrepute partly because of a failure to effectively apply U.S. 
military power: Harry S. Truman because of the Korea War, Lyndon B. Johnson 
because of Vietnam and Jimmy Carter because of the botched Iranian hostage 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, this President may not be in as good shape as many think because of 
the extraordinary economic, moral and international crosscurrents at work. 
Sometimes, it's not even enough to be blessed with a second-rate opposition.*

THE WORLD; OFFER NORTH KOREA A PACKAGE DEAL TO DROP ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert A. Manning, Robert A. Manning, a visiting fellow at the Progressive 
Policy Institute, is a former policy adviser in the East Asia and Pacific 
bureau of the State Department, .

<TEXT>
<P>
 Is Bill Clinton's major foreign-policy nightmare -- a confrontation with a 
North Korea armed with nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles -- over? Don't 
pop those champagne corks, yet. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea's 11th-hour decision to allow the International Atomic Energy 
Agency to resume inspections of its seven declared nuclear facilities merely 
averts an immediate clash. While the political furor over the nuclear issue has 
subsided, the dispute is far from resolved: The potential risks -- ranging from 
another Korean war to instability and a nuclear arms race in Asia, to a 
collapse of an Orwellian family dynasty and chaos on the peninsula -- are as 
large as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if North Korea had not blinked, the IAEA's board of governors, which 
meets tomorrow in Vienna, would have had little choice but to declare that 
North Korea had violated its Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty commitment. The 
agency would then have had to refer the matter to the U.N. Security Council, 
which probably would have imposed some economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 If IAEA agents are actually permitted to inspect the facilities, the nuclear 
issue will come back to where it was a year ago. Then, the agency had demanded 
to see two suspected nuclear-waste sites that satellite photos revealed North 
Korea had hidden from it. 
</P>
<P>
 It was this demand for a "special inspection" that triggered the current 
imbroglio. North Korea threatened to become the first nation to withdraw from 
the non-proliferation regime, refusing to allow the IAEA to continue its 
regular inspections. Now we are back to negotiating over access to the waste 
sites amid continuing suspicions that North Korea is secretly trying to build 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea's success in dragging out the crisis is due as much to a confused 
U.S. policy as it is to Pyongyang's subterfuge. The large stakes and enormous 
complexity of the issue; competing bureaucratic interests producing a rash of 
leaks and conflicting public statements, and the perception, if not reality, 
that nobody is in charge -- all sent mixed signals to North Korea's leaders. 
Until November, the Administration had pursued an incremental approach, with no 
sense of what the end game might be. Then Clinton announced he would pursue a 
comprehensive approach. 
</P>
<P>
 But to date, Washington has not said what is in the comprehensive package or 
even if there has been agreement on one. If Pyongyang showed up at a meeting 
and offered to trade its nuclear program -- the only "card" the destitute and 
isolated regime has to play -- Washington, in return, could only offer "another 
meeting." If North Korea permits the IAEA to inspect the waste sites, 
implements its December, 1991, agreement with South Korea to create a 
denuclearized Korean Peninsula -- including an intrusive challenge-inspection 
regime -- and accounts for all its plutonium, the United States and its key 
allies, South Korea and Japan, should reciprocate. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea's concerns -- political legitimacy, economic help and security 
assurances -- are fundamental to its survival. The nuclear issue is 
inextricably bound up with the reunification of Korea. To succeed, U.S. policy 
must address the proliferation and the East Asian issues simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 So what is to be done? First, there is a need for a special coordinator on 
Korea who would report directly to the President. Whether it is North Korea 
acquiring a nuclear weapon or the collapse of the regime, Korea is an issue 
that can make or break the Clinton presidency. An experienced, no-nonsense 
negotiator respected on Capitol Hill and well regarded by our allies is 
necessary to manage the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a person would provide the best hope of disciplining the cumbersome 
bureaucracy, building bipartisan support, reaching timely decisions and, over 
the longer term, manage the impact of Korean unification. I say this as one who 
tried to navigate through this bureaucracy on the Korea issue while serving in 
the State Department for almost four years. 
</P>
<P>
 A "package deal" should be, in essence, a reciprocal political and 
confidence-building process involving several stages. For example, if the IAEA 
is allowed to visit the waste sites or if Pyongyang dismantles its reprocessing 
facilities, lifting the trade embargo against North Korea might be considered. 
Any such step should be closely coordinated with parallel steps by Seoul and 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the nuclear bombs, North Korea's sale of ballistic missiles and 
its development of a 1,000-kilometer missile capable of striking South Korea 
and Japan, as well as its forward-deployed conventional forces, should be 
elements of a grand bargain designed to reduce tension, facilitate North-South 
reconciliation and engineer a "soft landing" for North Korea, which is 
undergoing a political succession whose outcome will not be complete until Kin 
Il Sung leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little risk in a comprehensive approach. If North Korea rejects a 
magnanimous proposition, Pyongyang would, in essence, be saying a nuclear bomb 
is its best insurance policy. In that case, having gone the extra diplomatic 
mile, the United States would be well-positioned to assemble a global coalition 
to impose U.N. sanctions on North Korea. Despite fears of Chinese 
obstructionism, if Washington made such a reasonable offer, Beijing is likely 
not to oppose sanctions. During the Gulf War, it should be recalled, China 
abstained on a vote on sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 If North Korea accepts the offer, it would have to open up its hermetically 
sealed society to absorb economic aid, trade and investment. Such a process 
would either dramatically change the regime or lead to its demise. Whichever, 
U.S. interests would be advanced: It is a win-win proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 To do any less would not only risk erosion of the non-proliferation regime, 
but increase the risk of confrontation by miscalculation and tarnish U.S. 
credibility in East Asia -- an area of growing importance to the United 
States.*

THE WORLD; AMERICA IS BEATING UP ON A COUNTRY THAT'S TRYING TO PLEASE IT;

MORE RECEPTIVE TO HELPING REDUCE THE TRADE DEFICIT.

<P>
 The post-Cold War era is tough on U.S. allies. 
</P>
<P>
 When Clinton Administration officials said "time is up" and figura tively drew 
a line in the sand against intolerable international behavior, they were not 
threatening unilateral action against the gang of Haitians who prevented U.S. 
troops from landing in Haiti to help implement a U.S.-brokered agreement 
transferring power from military to civilian authorities. Or the North Korean 
government that, despite agreeing to international inspections of seven nuclear 
facilities, continues to dodge questions about its nuclear-weapons capability 
and ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 No, the Clinton Administration was targeting a Japanese leader who has opened 
up his country's rice and construction markets, adopted a huge 
economic-stimulus plan to encourage more Japanese imports and who has committed 
himself to deregulating his economy and initiating major political reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The press conference after the failed talks between President Bill Clinton and 
Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa did nothing to dispel this 
impression. Although Clinton was gracious, even effusive, in his praise of 
Hosokawa, the President made it clear that he has reached the end of his 
patience with Japan. The subsequent U.S. threat to impose sanctions unless 
Japan fully opens its cellular-phone market, official hints of renewing the 
Super 301 provision, which mandates retaliation against trading practices that 
the United States deems "unfair," and the implicit warning to drive up the 
value of the yen as a means of reducing Japan's trade surplus -- all underscore 
the Administration's determination to alter the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 These developments, coming immediately after Clinton's public call for a 
"period of reflection," also suggest that the Administration has come to see a 
hard-line stance on Japan as something of a "win-win" situation: Either 
Japanese leaders cave in to U.S. demands for specific import targets and 
numerical indicators of progress in opening the Japanese market, or Clinton 
gains stature and credibility with the American public for hanging tough. This 
suggests a second lesson: Slamming Japan is good politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Both lessons are products of long-evident changes. The collapse of the Soviet 
Union and end of the Cold War not only removed the sense of common threat but 
also weakened the glue cementing U.S.-Japan relations. The advent of global 
economic interdependence linked the creation of domestic jobs directly to the 
behavior of America's key trading partners. And the increased U.S. dependence 
on trade and exports for stimulating domestic economic growth boosted the 
importance of opening the Japanese market. Cumulatively, these changes did not 
so much relegate strategic issues to a back burner as they made critical 
domestic imperatives key strategic objectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts agree that the overwhelming share of the U.S. trade deficit is 
caused by macroeconomic factors. They also agree that structural differences 
between the U.S. and Japanese economies are at the heart of bilateral economic 
tensions. Addressing these differences will necessarily be a time-consuming 
process. Even so, it is striking how slow Japan has been in responding. 
</P>
<P>
 The dominant U.S. inclination is to ascribe this slowness to the power of 
Japan's bureaucracy and the unwillingness of Japanese political leaders to 
compel change. While there is some truth to this explanation, a number of 
underlying factors appear more salient: 
</P>
<P>
 * Principles . No matter how packaged, U.S. insistence on "objective criteria" 
and "numerical indicators" for measuring progress in opening Japan's markets 
comes across to Japanese as managed trade. Nearly universal Japanese opposition 
to this approach has enabled the government to claim the moral high ground and 
bolstered bureaucratic and political opposition to U.S. pressure. The 
Administration's inability to redefine the issue in terms that could enlist 
greater public support in Japan may represent the single greatest failure in 
U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Distrust . Japan's "principled" opposition to managed trade is bolstered by 
its semiconductor experience: A specified goal was transformed into a minimum 
level of imports that had to be reached to avoid U.S. sanctions. Underlying 
this experience, however, are years of mounting resentment of what many 
Japanese, rightly or wrongly, perceive to be U.S. unilateralism and 
highhandedness on trade issues, which make Japanese suspicion more resistant to 
persuasion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Recession . It was the misfortune of the Clinton Administration to present 
its demands for greater shares of Japan's markets at precisely the time when 
the Japanese economy is going through a long and deep recession. Whatever 
willingness Japanese companies might have had in the days of growth and 
prosperity to consider voluntary import arrangements, their enthusiasm for 
affirmative-action programs at a time of low domestic growth and strong 
pressures on Japanese exports is clearly minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 * Competitive politics . The establishment of a new coalition government in 
Japan signified more than the defeat of the Liberal Democratic Party. It marked 
the advent of competitive politics, with its emphasis on public persuasion and 
ad hoc alliances. Together with Hosokawa's weak political base, the end of 
single-party rule has both complicated consensus-building and exacerbated the 
task of implementing political change. 
</P>
<P>
 All this may suggest a third lesson: A weak Japan is not a strong U.S. 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens next? 
</P>
<P>
 The most likely outcome remains some sort of compromise. Both sides agree that 
there must be some means for measuring progress in expanding foreign access, 
and the high stakes weigh against a major rupture. In the end, Japan will exert 
maximum efforts to reach an accommodation, because the United States is central 
to Japanese interests. 
</P>
<P>
 These efforts are likely to involve the implementation of market-opening 
measures already proposed in U.S.-Japan discussions, along with plans to 
stimulate and further deregulate the Japanese economy. Japan will strive to 
avoid tit-for-tat retaliation, although it may well initiate actions under the 
General Agreement on Tariff and Trade against any U.S. sanctions. New efforts 
to find a term other than numerical targets are likely. Tentative indications 
that the U.S. might not insist on guaranteed market shares and specific sales 
numbers if some other means of tracking Japanese performance is developed 
suggest a possible resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 But the danger should not be underestimated. Already, charges of "betrayal" 
and "bad faith" are heard. The slope leading to souring relations is that much 
slippery. Underlying forces in both societies make political paralysis in Tokyo 
and gridlock between Japan and the United States a real possibility. A 
ratcheting up of tensions and some form of trade war cannot be ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the current impasse is surmounted, however, the collapse of the 
framework negotiations raises a number of longer-term questions. Is it possible 
to maintain a mutually advantageous relation in an environment where either of 
the parties sees at least temporary political payoffs from its deterioration? 
Can we move away from defining U.S.-Japan relations so singularly in terms of 
trade and approach the relationship as a critical means of extending our global 
interests? As we look to the 21st Century, what kind of world do we want to see 
develop and what role do U.S.-Japan ties play in facilitating its development? 
</P>
<P>
 Once U.S. officials get done patting themselves on their backs for having 
avoided a "bad" agreement, and Japanese leaders get over their rush at having 
finally "said no" to Uncle Sam, they should address such questions.*

PERSPECTIVE ON MIDEAST PEACE; A LOGJAM IN NEED OF A U.S. NUDGE; ISRAELI-PLO 
NEGOTIATIONS ARE STUCK OVER HOW MUCH CONCESSION IS ENOUGH; MEANWHILE, STAKES 
RISE IN 'GREATER JERUSALEM.'

<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't be fooled by the applause that accompanied the Arafat-Peres signing of a 
partial agreement in Cairo two weeks ago. The Israeli-Palestinian peace process 
is in trouble and may flounder without U.S. leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Five months after the signing of the Declaration of Principles between Israel 
and the Palestine Liberation Organization, the process of negotiating 
disengagement and peace has yet to produce anything concrete. This inability to 
move forward is a function of problems inherent in the negotiating partners 
themselves: the weakness of both the Labor government of Israel and the PLO, 
and the asymmetry in the power relationship between them. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, Israel holds all the cards: It controls all of the Palestinian 
territory and all aspects of daily life there. As a result, the negotiating 
process has been reduced to Palestinian reactions to Israeli positions, all of 
which are presented as "firm and non-negotiable." The only options available to 
the Palestinian negotiators are saying "no" and threatening to abort the 
process, or attempting to whittle away at the "firm" Israeli positions in hopes 
of winning some face-saving gestures. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said as much in a Feb. 11 interview when 
he observed, "These negotiations are with ourselves. The Palestinians don't 
have so much to give us." 
</P>
<P>
 So the fate of the process rests in Israeli goodwill and the willingness of 
the Labor government to respect Palestinian rights and dignity and to give the 
Palestinians enough concessions to maintain the integrity of the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 This leads to the second difficulty facing the peace process, which is the 
belief of both Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat that they have only a tenuous 
hold over their respective constituencies. While both leaders are invested in 
the process and publicly recognize the need to support each other's position, 
Rabin's government seems to be afraid of giving more than it has, and the PLO 
-- as Peres accurately expressed it -- doesn't have much to give.  
</P>
<P>
 The product of this rather weak recipe has been an unpalatable stew. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Cairo signing, the Israeli press gloated that Israel got everything 
it wanted -- control of all security arrangements -- while making few, 
primarily symbolic concessions. The Arab and Palestinian press chafed at the 
insult of the "humiliating" security agreement. Palestinian and Israeli 
extremists, sensing the weakness in the process, have used violence and harsh 
rhetoric to agitate popular fears and further constrain their leaders.  
</P>
<P>
 If left alone under this scenario, the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators 
cannot successfully complete an agreement that meets both parties' minimal 
needs. Outside assistance, and specifically U.S. leadership, will be required 
to give each side the strength and support it needs to move forward. 
</P>
<P>
 While the United States has until now refused to become engaged in the 
negotiating process and will not put pressure on Israel to make concessions, 
there are at least two steps it could take to help bring the process to 
fruition. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the situation with regard to Jerusalem: All parties agreed that the 
question of Jerusalem would be left for final-stage negotiations, and that no 
unilateral steps would be taken to alter conditions on the ground during the 
negotiating process. Nevertheless, Israel acknowledges that it is constructing 
15,000 new housing units (in addition to completing the 13,500 units begun by 
the Likud government) in what it describes as Greater Jerusalem -- an expanded 
area stretching at some points more than six miles from the historic city. This 
building, coupled with the "security roads" and tunnels that Israel is 
constructing to connect settlements with each other and Jerusalem, is cutting 
the West Bank into cantons and serves as a daily reminder to the Palestinians 
of their lack of control over their lives; it sharpens their fear of never 
gaining any semblance of control over their territory. 
</P>
<P>
 A firm and public U.S. position against the construction within the occupied 
territories would enhance the integrity of the process and give the powerless 
Palestinians some sense of support in their quest for a just and lasting 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, a continuing concern of the Palestinians has been their inability to 
gain direct access to foreign markets during the 27 years of Israeli 
occupation. A single U.S. announcement that the terms of the U.S.-Israel 
free-trade agreement would apply to Palestinian products exported from the 
autonomous regions would go a long way toward assuring Palestinians that they 
can benefit economically from peace. 
</P>
<P>
 It is axiomatic that an enduring peace settlement is one in which both victor 
and vanquished emerge strengthened. So far, negotiations within the context of 
the current, uneven Israeli-Palestinian relationship and the lack of outside 
support have served to enhance Israeli strength while further eroding the 
Palestinian position. But a weakened Palestinian authority will not and cannot 
produce peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Since both leaderships feel compelled to push the process forward, it may be 
possible for Israel to press the Palestinians to agree to its terms for 
autonomy and strip the Palestinians of even the trappings of sovereignty and 
dignity. But such an accord would be impossible for the PLO to sell to its 
already restless and angry constituency. Israeli Environment Minister Yossi 
Sarid recognized this point when he said, "When we are talking about security 
matters, we have to twist the arms of our dialogue partners. But when we twist 
the arms, we have to be careful not to break them." 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Rabin may feel that he is unable to offer more to the 
Palestinians, and Chairman Arafat surely feels that he doesn't have nearly 
enough to offer the Palestinians. Without directly entering the process, the 
United States can -- must -- take steps that will open up this impasse.

<P>
 * Even though their daughter, Patti, has made a lifelong career of bashing her 
parents, President and Mrs. Reagan have refrained from any public rebuttal of 
her outrageous claims. President and Mrs. Reagan have tried continuously to 
resolve Patti's problems privately as a family matter, yet every effort to 
reach out to her has been rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 I cannot understand why The Times gives such high visibility to the outrageous 
charges of such a deeply disturbed woman (Feb. 15). I see little news value in 
covering a subculture educational program she conducted which could only draw 
25 attendees. Furthermore, I can't begin to think that Patti's latest attempt 
as an author could be deemed newsworthy since few, if any, pages of her lewd 
book could be printed in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is it that just two weeks ago, when Margaret Thatcher led thousands of 
people in a highly visible tribute to President Reagan and his service to the 
world, The Times did not even report it? Yet, when his emotionally disturbed 
daughter again repeats her mean-spirited charges against her parents you devote 
a front-page Metro article to it?

 * So pleased to see yet another rapacious offspring cashing in on her parents' 
good name and fortune by dragging it through the mud. After all, if Patti Davis 
were not the daughter of former President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan, who would buy 
her books and pay to listen to her speak, and what newspaper would devote an 
entire cover page, plus, to the coverage of Davis' seminar? 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly, I am surprised that with Davis' liberal approach toward politics she 
is not adhering to Clinton's policy of "don't ask, don't tell." I have two 
succinct words for Davis: private life -- get one!

A HISTORY WORTH WORKING FOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A history free of bias. That was the goal of Carter G. Woodson, an African 
American historian who in 1926 -- when this nation was racially divided by law 
and custom -- proposed devoting one week to celebrate and study black history 
and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to dispel stereotypes about black Americans, the Harvard-trained 
professor called for selection of the second week in February because that week 
included the birthdays of two famous orators and abolitionists: Frederick 
Douglass, the black journalist, and Abraham Lincoln, the president who freed 
the slaves. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, during the American Bicentennial celebration and 50 years after the 
first observance, Negro History Week was expanded to Black History Month. Since 
then February has become a time to annually acknowledge the accomplishments of 
black Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 For many non-blacks it is the only time to formally remember the ravages of 
slavery, the shackles of Jim Crow and the legacy of discrimination. For too 
many, it is the lone opportunity to acknowledge the battles to overcome 
discrimination and all the work that remains to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 American history is the story of a rainbow of cultures and contributions. All 
should be included equally. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter Woodson, an integrationist, envisioned a time when no separate 
celebration would be needed to call attention to the accomplishments of black 
Americans. His ultimate goal was an integrated history that reflected no bias. 
That remains a worthwhile objective.

CAREFULLY INTO THE BREACH; BEST RX FOR HEALTH CARE REFORM? SLOW, BUT KEEP GOING 
FORWARD STEADILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Semantic squabbles over whether the U.S. system of health care is in "crisis" 
miss the point. It's no secret that the nation's system is not what it should 
be and that Americans pay a terrible price for its shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
 At long last, lawmakers are beginning to focus on what most have known for a 
long time: This nation's health care system works well for only a steadily 
shrinking number of Americans. Physicians and nurses see horrific inadequacies 
in how the system rations care. They see emergency room patients waiting for 
treatment for a once minor ailment that has become a costly, life-threatening 
illness because the patient could not afford to get treatment earlier. Insurers 
see millions of dollars in fraud each year perpetrated by unscrupulous 
physicians, lawyers, patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients want to receive the best possible treatment; but what if a 
state-of-the-art test costs $1,500? Who pays? 
</P>
<P>
 Already the average American who is insured finds he or she is paying more and 
has less freedom in choosing a doctor. And those are the lucky ones; 37 million 
have no health insurance at all. To bring it full circle, it's the uninsured 
who typically crowd hospital emergency rooms seeking what should have been 
routine care. Who gets the bill? Everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians hear the public roar for change, but every step in that direction 
is met with fierce opposition from one or another of the many competing special 
interests. That is why as lawmakers review the health care reform options they 
must resist the temptation for quick or easy fixes. In health reform, if the 
fixes are quick they're dangerous and if they're too easy they're not real. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there are good starting points on which many lawmakers already agree: 
cracking down on fraud and excessive paperwork; prohibiting the unfair practice 
by insurers of denying coverage based on pre-existing medical conditions; 
establishing purchasing pools that would give individuals and small businesses 
greater clout to negotiate rates with insurers; promoting a package of benefits 
that covers preventive services, such as childhood immunizations or Pap smears. 
</P>
<P>
 The financing and cost-control elements of health care reform clearly are 
those with the greatest chance of causing unintended consequences. For example, 
would President Clinton's plan to require employers to provide employee 
coverage encourage companies to contract out more jobs? Would limits on federal 
tax deductions allowed for employers encourage them to dump insurance coverage 
for their workers? 
</P>
<P>
 As Congress studies options for health care reform, the unintended 
consequences must be carefully explored. As one analyst aptly put it, "It is 
things like this that make me a gradualist when it comes to public policy."

THE NEXT LOS ANGELES: REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; EARTHQUAKE AS WAKE-UP CALL: THE 
OPPORTUNITY; THE REGION IS JOLTED INTO NEW RECOGNITION OF POSSIBILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles in the 21st Century. What might that vision be? An ultra-modern 
City of Angels cleared of smog and heavy traffic thanks to sleek rail lines 
that people actually use? A high-tech city that is a world telecommuting mecca 
where sophisticated computers, phones, faxes and other interactive media 
instantly connect people within and outside the region, across continents and 
oceans? A Los Angeles that once again is home to a respected public education 
system? 
</P>
<P>
 All beyond the realm of possibility? No. Southern California long has been 
known as a place where people can remake themselves, their lives and even the 
environment. But when the Northridge earthquake shook Los Angeles Jan. 17, it 
made us all too aware of the region's vulnerability. The quake disrupted our 
normal patterns of living, working and commuting. 
</P>
<P>
 But out of the adversity come opportunities -- new ways to reconnect a 
sprawling, fragmented region. We all pulled together to get through the 
earthquake's aftermath, and that process has caused us to critically examine 
the status quo -- what works, what does not. More important, we have had to 
experiment, to change to accommodate new demands. New ideas, many of which were 
included in The Times' special section last Sunday, "The Next Los Angeles: 
Reinventing Our Future," should be entertained and adopted as we rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 As the old saying goes, necessity is the mother of invention. The earthquake 
knocked down parts of the Santa Monica, Golden State and other freeways, 
forcing us into commuting alternatives. Commuters swarmed onto Metrolink trains 
in the days after the quake . . . but in recent weeks ridership has dropped off 
as Angelenos once again returned to their cars. That's unfortunate. We need to 
rethink ways to eliminate traffic gridlock and encourage greater use of mass 
transit and car pools. We should consider incentives to both employers and 
employees to foster car-pooling and a return to Metrolink. One truly innovative 
idea is to create a market in commuter miles -- similar to the market in smog 
credits -- in which companies would be allotted miles based on a formula that 
takes into account the number of people they employ; companies then could trade 
these commuter miles in an orderly market. We also need to expand the rail 
network to include an east-west corridor along Exposition Boulevard and from 
Downtown to Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Telecommuting should be more widely used as an alternative to centralized 
operations. More than 1 million employees in Los Angeles, Ventura and Orange 
counties already use computers, faxes, modems and phones to work from home on a 
regular basis. Such setups reduce office and parking expenses for companies and 
lessen stress on employees and save them time, making them more productive. 
</P>
<P>
 With some schools out of commission, we need to consider alternative sites, 
possibly even converting vacant commercial office space into teaching 
facilities. Might this be the time to experiment with districtwide open 
enrollment? Providing transportation for students would be key to making this 
idea work. Granting autonomy to individual schools and their communities, or at 
least greater flexibility, also would expedite school reform efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 While the San Fernando Valley suffered the worst of the damage, other parts of 
the city cannot be ignored in rethinking Los Angeles. Downtown Los Angeles, for 
all its gleaming high-rises, is virtually a ghost town after dark because it 
lacks affordable housing and a sense of community and most Downtown workers 
live far from their jobs. In Santa Monica, the rebuilding of damaged hospitals 
provides an opportunity -- to be explored on this page Monday -- to build a new 
health care model. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the need is for leadership and vision to replace partisan politics 
and indifferent citizenship. We must take a fresh look at the idea of regional 
governance to address problems that transcend city and county lines. Should we 
give the mayor more power? Should we add members to the City Council, or elect 
them citywide? Should neighborhood councils be instituted? What's needed, as 
Times political writer Ronald Brownstein put it last Sunday, is "smarter, more 
imaginative and more ambitious government." Reinventing the region for the 21st 
Century will require that -- and the will of its people to change.

'THREE STRIKES' CRIME PROPOSALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * American Bar Assn. President R. William Ide is using the wrong data when he 
states that "the United States has 1.3 million people in prison . . . with very 
little impact on crime rates over the past decade" (Jan. 27). Regardless of the 
number of people in jail, the data reported by Joseph Bessette (Commentary, 
Jan. 17) are more revealing: median time served for homicide, three years, four 
months; robbery, one year, 11 months; assault with a deadly weapon, one year, 
11 months. There may be a lot of people in jail, but these criminals are not 
staying very long. Get out quick and do it again is what "three strikes" is 
trying to stop. Yes, it will cost serious money for more jail facilities unless 
we release so-called "victimless crimes" inmates. As for resources to try the 
accused, excuse me, but I think they are already being tried for their 
felonies, not once but several times. If they don't come back again we will 
save money in the long run.

 * Before we get swept away by this lock-'em-up-and-throw-away-the-key 
mentality with the "three times and out" approach to crime, let's consider one 
probable result of such a plan. Consider the two-time offender. What will be 
his reaction to the new law? When committing further crimes, he has been given 
an incentive to kill all witnesses. What has he to lose? He's going to jail for 
life if he is caught, anyway.  
</P>
<P>
 Will we be making killers out of criminals who otherwise would probably not 
kill? We had better consider carefully all of the possible consequences of such 
laws.

<P>
 * Re the Feb. 14 editorial, "Three Strikes and You're Where?": What is missing 
from this dialogue is that victims are left out of the equation. Crimes that 
occur are crimes against a real victim, not crimes against the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Fellowship, a national criminal justice reform organization founded by 
Charles Colson, former special counsel to President Nixon, introduces the 
concept of "restorative justice." This means seeking justice and healing for 
those impacted by crime: the victim, the community and the offender. The 
offender must be held accountable for his actions, he must pay back his victim 
and seek to "make things right." 
</P>
<P>
 If we are not seeking to do these things, "three strikes and you're out" 
doesn't help much. With overcrowding at 180% in our state prisons and rising, 
we know we cannot incarcerate everyone. Close to 60% of all those inmates 
serving time in our state prisons are nonviolent offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Fellowship supports community punishment for non-dangerous, nonviolent 
offenders. Giving judges an array of intermediate sanctions for targeted 
nonviolent offenders punishes the offender, holds the offender accountable to 
his victim, and promotes healing in the community where the crime occurred. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * In all the current talk regarding crime, a central fact is ignored. For 
every 100,000 U.S. citizens, 407 are incarcerated. But for African Americans, 
the rate is 3,100 -- nearly eight times the national average. Coupled with this 
appalling figure is the fact that 60% of black males under the age of 24 are 
unemployed. The connection seems obvious: Unemployment and crime go together. 
</P>
<P>
 America needs to offer all young people access to meaningful jobs. This means 
proper education. Some community programs already are providing counseling and 
training for at-risk youth. In the South Bronx, for example, the Argus Learning 
for Living Center tutors in reading and other marketable skills. And in Los 
Angeles, a program called the Rites of Passage teaches skills needed to 
successfully complete educational programs. These programs gear at-risk youth 
away from crime and toward the marketplace.  
</P>
<P>
 In California, the cost of mandatory sentencing is likely to break the back of 
the state's already straining economy. Estimates have projected that the $300 
billion spent annually on California prisons would at least double by the end 
of the decade if third-time felons were jailed for life. Instead of making the 
government piggyback more tax burdens, why don't we try to create taxpayers?

 * I would be in favor of "three strikes" legislation if it also applied to the 
higher echelons of corporate America, i.e., three jobs sent overseas and you're 
in for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's face it. Crime is a social condition and is just as much the fault of 
ignorance in the infrastructure as it is of ignorance in the individual. We all 
suffer. We all pay. Wake up, society!

MCA SUBWAY STOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * To Universal/MCA officials may we all say, "For shame," for their effort to 
grab for their corporate pocketbook (Feb. 11) monies generated to help 
alleviate the misery, pain and suffering inflicted by our Jan. 17 earthquake! 
Lives have been shattered; homes have been rendered uninhabitable; businesses 
both small and large have been destroyed, leaving thousands without jobs or 
income. And while area residents and businesses are struggling to piece 
together what they can -- to rebuild, to support themselves and their families 
-- we learn that MCA wishes to use federal assistance funds to change the 
location of a subway stop so that it will better line its corporate pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Were the sum involved here even just a few thousand dollars, the mere idea of 
raiding earthquake relief funds for such self-serving, profit-driven purposes 
would be distasteful; we are not talking, though, of "just" a few thousand 
dollars, but rather of tens of million, of $40 million, $50 million, $60 
million.  
</P>
<P>
 Let us hope that our public officials will respond accordingly and say no to 
this attempted raid by the greedy on funds intended for the needy.

COLUMN RIGHT/ JONATHAN CLARKE: THE BIG STICK NO LONGER CARRIES WEIGHT; 
WASHINGTON'S THREATS DON'T IMPRESS FOREIGNERS WHO CAN READ THE U.S. 
ELECTORATE'S INTERESTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN CLARKE, Jonathan Clarke, a member of the British diplomatic service 
for 20 years, is now at the Cato Institute in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The breakdown of the trade talks with Japan provides more troubling evidence 
of the Clinton Administration's inability to develop a credible foreign policy. 
Yet again, it has allowed big talk to run far ahead of the means available for 
achieving its objectives. Unless this habit is checked, foreigners will 
continue to run negotiating rings around the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The fault does not lie primarily with the policy objectives. No one would 
argue against efforts to assist the Russian transition to democracy, to bring 
about peace in Bosnia or to counter nuclear proliferation. Execution, however, 
has been woefully inadequate. As George Kennan remarked, the errors reside in 
the "how" rather than the "what." 
</P>
<P>
 Time and time again, the Administration has permitted a hopeless 
overestimation of its ability to mold the world after its own designs to take 
charge of its rhetoric and operational methods. Under the influence of the 
intoxicating vision of America as the sole remaining superpower, many inside 
the Administration and on Capitol Hill believe that they can demand foreign 
acquiescence in their wishes, either as America's due or by threat of 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 The sight of the Japanese prime minister not merely refusing to be intimidated 
by his host in Washington, but talking with nonchalant equanimity about the 
worst that the Administration could throw at him by way of retaliation, should 
surely be enough to demonstrate the waywardness of this approach. 
</P>
<P>
 A greater sense of strategic finesse is needed. The time has long departed 
when foreign leaders, even those of major powers, would undertake meek 
pilgrimages to Washington to collect their marching orders. They no longer need 
the security guarantees on which this deference was based. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, the basic facts of American politics do not go unnoticed by foreign 
nations, friendly and unfriendly alike. Even an international cause celebre 
like Bosnia attracts the close attention of only 0.5% of the electorate, 
compared with the 48% that reports itself transfixed by Tonya Harding. They 
deduce from these figures that, for all the macho talk in Washington, no public 
consensus exists in favor of costly foreign-policy ventures. North Korea, for 
example, can easily calculate that few Americans are in the mood for a land war 
in Asia. Administration statements or congressional resolutions to the contrary 
ring hollow and compromise America's ability to address the Korean nuclear 
problem with the seriousness it deserves. 
</P>
<P>
 On economic matters, foreigners also have a shrewd idea of the American 
self-interest. They know that this nation's welfare is crucially linked to 
foreign trade and they expect that Americans, rational beings that they are, 
will act with this in mind. Asians, for instance, cannot believe that American 
policy-makers would be so illogical as to jeopardize the nearly 3 million 
American jobs that currently depend on Asian trade, or the prospects for many 
more such jobs, about which President Clinton waxed so lyrical at November's 
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. Threats of trade sanctions, 
therefore, command scant respect. 
</P>
<P>
 The big stick brigade will dismiss this analysis as "declinist" or "selling 
America short." They will argue that the United States must negotiate from 
strength and hang tough. This makes for good sound bites at home, but as 
foreigners increasingly perceive an absence of commitment behind the stern 
American language, they will feel able to disregard American positions, 
including those that are central to the nation's interests. Those draping 
themselves in patriotic colors are in fact rendering their country a 
disservice. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has many vital national interests on which no compromise is 
possible. To safeguard these, the United States needs a reformed diplomatic 
strategy based on realism rather than rhetoric.  
</P>
<P>
 First, stop treating the Asians and Europeans as though they were small-town 
mayors who can be browbeaten or bought off. Work with them as though they were 
powerful members of Congress who might be on the different side of today's 
issue but whose support may be vital tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 And when dealing with adversaries, ensure that the prospective punitive action 
is credible and that the means are appropriate to the ends desired. It is 
pointless, for example, to cut off aid to punish a country that is lagging in 
drug eradication if the aid cut-off only stimulates drug production. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington is a noisy town, so some high-decibel diplomacy is inevitable. But 
the less vainglorious the talk, the better the chance that the United States 
will attain its foreign-policy objectives.

PLATFORM; EPA COULD EASE UP A BIT ON QUAKE-SHOCKED BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY C. GROVEMAN, BARRY C. GROVEMAN, an attorney specializing in 
environmental matters with the law firm of McKenna & Cuneo, says that the 
Environmental Protection Agency is impeding business' earthquake recovery: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A family-owned San Fernando Valley heat-treating firm that employs 30 people 
faces the prospect of coming up with $100,000 over the next several months and 
as much as $1 million over the next few years for ground-water cleanup. The 
quake will eliminate at least a month's worth of income for the firm. It needs 
a break from the EPA to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 A small manufacturer's plant was damaged, along with the homes of some of its 
140 employees. The firm is under an order to spend $500,000 immediately to 
upgrade the plant to satisfy the EPA's strict interpretation of a regulation 
that even the agency admits is confusing. Local sanitation officials say that 
sewage treatment won't be compromised if the upgrading is delayed, but the EPA 
has to agree and has been unwilling to exercise discretion. 
</P>
<P>
 Quake-damaged small businesses that have been directed by the EPA to clean up 
contaminated ground water need additional time to develop less costly options 
for doing the job. The financial burden of expensive new purification 
technologies will be the last straw for many firms, on top of damaged plants, 
employee absenteeism, disrupted work orders and lost revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS, not known for its flexibility, waived penalties for taxpayers who 
missed the January filing deadline and instructed them to write "L.A. 
Earthquake" on the top of their tax form. The Franchise Tax Board postponed the 
due date for sales-tax payments by a month. The Agriculture Department issued 
food stamps to quake victims on request. Even the giant Social Security 
bureaucracy mobilized to produce monthly checks a week early to ensure that 
earthquake victims received them on time. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA sees itself as a cop, catching and penalizing polluters who deserve no 
sympathy. But if the EPA doesn't take into account the scope of the disruption 
and damage caused by the earthquake, it is, in essence, punishing small 
businesses with "three strikes and you're out!" That approach may be justified 
for locking up habitual criminals, but for many small businesses, suffering the 
EPA's indifference on top of the recession and the quake will mean a third 
strike that knocks them out altogether.

 As Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. did in the 1992 Democratic presidential 
primary, state Sen. Tom Hayden is trying to hold Democrats hostage to a 
political reform agenda. And, as Brown did in '92, Hayden promises to bow out 
if the major Democratic candidates embrace his reforms. No wonder Hayden has 
been labeled the Jerry Brown of the '94 gubernatorial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Brown carefully cultivated a populist, anti-Washington image. 
Hayden has carefully cultivated a populist, anti-Sacramento image. Both men are 
consummate "insider-outsiders," using media savvy gained through years of 
political maneuvering to rail against a system that has never fully embraced 
them or their ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 The '92 Democratic National Convention was abuzz with speculation over how 
Brown's guerrilla antics would affect the party's nominee, Bill Clinton. Would 
they push Clinton to the left in order to hold his party base? Or might they 
allow him to spotlight his move toward a moderate "third way"? 
</P>
<P>
 Today's conventional wisdom holds that Hayden's candidacy will likely hurt 
Kathleen Brown more than state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi. At this 
point, front-runner Brown doesn't need California's political media to shake 
off its boredom and begin paying serious attention to the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Hayden candidacy could do that. Reporters like covering Hayden; they 
relish a livelier race. That's good news for Garamendi, still lagging in 
fund-raising and name recognition. But better coverage can also help Kathleen 
Brown. The camera does love her. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1992 primaries, Jerry Brown's "scorched earth" tactics forced 
Clinton to more clearly define his persona. Similarly, Hayden's candidacy could 
help Kathleen Brown define herself -- at a time when she is increasingly 
accused of "fuzziness." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, if being specific translates into sounding too liberal, Kathleen 
Brown could be in big trouble come the general election. But, again, 1992 is 
instructive. By pressing his reform agenda, Jerry Brown helped Clinton look 
more moderate. If Hayden remains in the race, Kathleen Brown will have to work 
harder and risk more in June, because she needs to win as Clinton did -- 
without veering left or right. But if she survives the primary, that could make 
her a stronger candidate for November. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Kathleen Brown could panic and list to port. Indeed, 
Hayden, who plays the populist card more convincingly than Garamendi, could 
force both Brown and Garamendi to the left. The better to capture likely 
Democratic primary voters, perhaps -- but not a comfortable position for the 
party's nominee in a California general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Being Jerry Brown's sister might have helped in the primary, if Kathleen could 
have quietly inherited the remnants of the "Brownies" -- party activists whose 
enthusiasm helped keep Jerry Brown alive and pumping politically. He appealed 
to environmentalists, disaffected Democrats and younger, liberal activists -- a 
nice primary base to have. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden's candidacy has precluded any stealth-liberal strategy. To hold 
supporters of Hayden's strong stands on environmental issues and political 
reform, Kathleen Brown may be tempted to use her brother far more visibly than 
she would like. And that could prove to be heavy baggage in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The general electorate is more moderate than primary voters, and thus likely 
to be less tolerant of Jerry Brown. And with crime still a hot issue, Gov. Pete 
Wilson gleefully continues to tar Kathleen Brown with her brother's liberal 
state Supreme Court appointments and opposition to the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the matter of pre-primary debates. Hayden could certainly spice 
them up, because he's scrappy and can give good sound-bite. No front-runner -- 
particularly one whose momentum appears to have stalled -- wants to face that 
kind of buzz-saw. But can Kathleen Brown afford to duck out? Not in this era of 
"teledemocracy." Not when her opponents are panting to prove the lady is not 
tough enough for the rigors of campaigning, let alone governing. 
</P>
<P>
 So Kathleen Brown will probably have to participate in a few debates, and she 
could easily find herself overshadowed as Garamendi and Hayden policy-wonk it 
out. But that's not necessarily harmful. Clinton, the ultimate policy wonk, 
often loses his audience when he abandons the rhetoric of the bully pulpit for 
technical jargon. Voters want leaders, not middle-level managers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Jerry Brown finally chose not to be an obstructionist. Hayden says he 
won't be one, either. Indeed, if his candidacy ensures a spirited Democratic 
primary, it could boost Democratic chances in the nonpartisan race for 
superintendent of public instruction, the only statewide constitutional office 
that can be won outright in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin (D-Fremont), the front-runner, is supported by 
the Legislature's Democratic leadership, teachers and women's groups. Her 
strongest opponent is likely to be Maureen DiMarco, an apostate Democrat who 
has served the last three years as Wilson's secretary of child development and 
education. A hotly contested gubernatorial primary on the Democratic side, 
coupled with what looks to be a lackluster Republican race, could conceivably 
produce a lopsided turnout that would give Eastin a June victory. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, Hayden, the wild card, and Brown, the shadow candidate, 
might bring to this election year the kind of unpredictability that makes 
California politics fun to watch. Countering a reporter's characterization of 
his campaign as "whimsical," Hayden retorted, "We need more whimsy in 
politics."

THE MYTH THAT THREATENS TO EAT CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David B. Friedman, David B. Friedman, a Los Angeles attorney, is director of 
the New Economy Project. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The economic foundations of California are slowly eroding because of the 
unchallenged dominance of an economic theory -- the technocratic myth -- that 
shakes self-confidence and distracts attention from the imperatives necessary 
for success in the new world economy. Its main premise is that anything of 
value in California only derives from a few high-tech industries -- large 
aerospace and publicly held computer companies. Since these industries face 
stiff global competition or are declining with federal budget cuts, California 
is doomed to a low-tech, low-wage service or menial assembly economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Relentlessly promoted by the media and the bureaucratic entities that would 
benefit the most from its policies, the technocratic myth dominates the state's 
economic-development debate. A recent article in The Times, for example, 
report- ed that, since large defense companies are the wellsprings of Southern 
California's technological and "quality" jobs base, and since these firms 
aren't successfully converting to commercial markets, the region's vitality 
will inevitably decline. The myth is reinforced when high-profile politicians 
equate California's future with the rise and fall of the defense budget, even 
though nearly 95% of the state's economy is not defense-related. 
</P>
<P>
 The most basic problem with the technocratic myth is the violence it does to 
the state's economic confidence. In the rare instances when the real structure 
of the California economy is examined, the unparalleled vitality and 
opportunity that still exist -- even in areas hit hard by defense cutbacks like 
Los Angeles County -- becomes immediately apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a continuing study -- dubbed the "New Economy Project" -- of the 
Los Angeles economy, the county is home to more than 3,500 computer hardware 
and software, biomedical, industrial instrument, and commercial R&D companies. 
Collectively, they generate $33 billion in direct revenues and employ more than 
250,000 people. Much of this industrial base is growing; preliminary survey 
results show that the rate of growth for the region's biomedical companies 
alone increased during the recession from about 7%, in 1989-90, to 20% in 
1991-92. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 90,000 Angelenos work in roughly 3,400 firms in the 
entertainment-crafts industry, which earns approximately $9 billion a year. 
Highly skilled engineers and technologists in the fields of water- and 
air-pollution instruments and engineering -- a small slice of California's 
$20-billion environmental sector -- have built a $3-billion industry that 
employs 20,000 people at almost 300 firms. 
</P>
<P>
 These figures, though reflecting only a fraction of the county's commerce, 
reveal a high-tech industrial base that employs more people than the total 
population of Idaho, generates more revenues than most states and exhibits a 
vitality that deindustrialized cities like New York, Atlanta or Houston can 
only dream about. That's one reason why -- despite defense layoffs, regressive 
and anti-California federal tax laws, relentlessly negative global publicity 
and a string of disasters -- the jobless rate in Los Angeles County remains 
close to the levels experienced by most major industrial regions. Orange County 
has recouped all its job losses during the last four years and now has an 
unemployment rate more than a full point below the national average. 
</P>
<P>
 But these economic realities remain almost completely outside the public 
debate, because the privately held firms that make up the backbone of the 
California economy don't have time to court the media and don't want the 
heavy-handed government "support" implicit in the technocratic agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 The technocratic myth is also staggeringly elitist. Despite its close 
association with the Democratic Party, its largely white proponents, sporting 
fancy degrees from big-name universities, systematically deprecate the value of 
work in such major manufacturing sectors as apparel or consumer electronics, 
let alone the state's myriad, high-quality service and retail industries. They 
do this in the curious belief that such enterprises don't create wealth, while 
big, rapidly downsizing firms and rigidly hierarchical research facilities 
dependent on tax dollars do. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, big-ticket R&D and federal-procurement projects, managed by 
alphabet-soup bureaucracies, are becoming increasingly irrelevant to job and 
industrial development. In the last five years, it is people like Charles Woo, 
president of L.A.-based Megatoys, who have helped generate, from scratch, a 
billion-dollar toy retail and manufacturing industry employing thousands of 
workers in the heart of the city. In the last decade, the growth of more than 
421 textile mills has made Los Angeles one of the world's most sophisticated 
knitted-goods weaving and printing centers, employing 20,000 workers and 
earning at least $3.2 billion a year, mostly in the areas bordering Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most damaging effect of the technocratic myth is that it stimulates a 
perverse impulse not to learn about and assist the myriad industries that can 
and do create jobs, careers and wealth, instead diverting public energy and 
money to a fantasy world made up of subsidized programs tied to the least 
competitive institutions in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 An example is a remarkably wrongheaded proposal for a state and federal 
manufacturing-assistance policy contained in a report titled "California 
Economic Strategies: Partnerships for State Revitalization." Released last week 
with the participation, among other entities, of the state Assembly Speaker's 
office, the report asserts that "outmoded, labor-intensive industries (such as 
apparel, shoe and furniture manufacture) can again become competitive through 
redesign and retrofit of obsolete equipment. Computer-assisted design projects 
by CALSTART and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the apparel and furniture 
manufacturing industries, as well as the Manufacturing Technology Initiative 
(MTI), show that this is feasible." 
</P>
<P>
 CALSTART, however, has yet to achieve compelling success in the electric-car 
field that is its primary purpose, let alone make "competitive" wholly 
unrelated industries. MTI, an effort loosely organized around the transfer of 
auto-body manufacturing technology to Los Angeles, has yet to name a management 
team or receive operational funding. To claim that either program "shows" that 
publicly supported consortia can "revitalize" industries currently employing 
hundreds of thousands of workers and generating billions in revenues provides 
sobering evidence of the almost complete disjuncture between the people who 
actually live and work in California's economy, and the technocrats who hunger 
to govern it. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid signs of recovery -- California generated 120,000 new jobs last year -- 
it is time for the state's political and media leaders to abandon the premises 
of the technocratic myth. Even now, California sustains a non-defense economy 
that successfully competes in every major industrial and service sector in the 
world. In this election year, there is no more important issue than finding the 
leaders willing to represent and make government responsive to this new 
economy, rather than be seduced by technocratic fantasies to try and recreate 
the industrial system of the past.*

COMMENTARY; WHY JOE BUCK AND RATSO LIVE ON; TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AFTER IT BECAME 
THE FIRST MAJOR X-RATED RELEASE, 'MIDNIGHT COWBOY' RETAINS ITS POWER, IF NOT 
ITS SCARLET LETTER, A REMINDER OF THE ADVENTUROUS FILMS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, Kenneth Turan is The Times' film critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though it's dead and buried, declared obsolete by the people who classify 
Hollywood's films, the ominous X rating is hardly forgotten. It did too much 
damage to ever go quietly into the night. 
</P>
<P>
 All by itself, this unassuming letter struck dread in the hearts of moralistic 
video chains, timid theaters and concerned family newspapers, all of whom 
refused to have anything to do with films that earned that awful rating. An X 
came to signify pornography and worse, films that trafficked with the devil and 
deserved to die. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there was a brief moment 25 years ago when X stood not for degradation but 
for hope. A moment before the rating became a moral football, kicked back and 
forth between zealots on both sides of the hard-core issue, when it seemed that 
Hollywood could deliver thoughtful adult entertainment without the world coming 
to an end. A moment defined by "Midnight Cowboy." 
</P>
<P>
 Though it doesn't seem possible, it has been a quarter of a century since Jon 
Voight's Joe Buck and Dustin Hoffman's Ratso Rizzo first shivered in Times 
Square doorways, and to commemorate that event, "Midnight Cowboy" will reopen 
this Friday at the Bruin in Westwood, the same theater it played in for more 
than a year during its initial release. 
</P>
<P>
 And though this rebirth is accompanied by the usual hoopla about a newly 
restored print and an original mono soundtrack remixed especially for Dolby, 
there is more to think about this time than the familiar questions of 
filmmaking aesthetics and memorable performances. 
</P>
<P>
 For "Midnight Cowboy" did more than win a trio of top-drawer Oscars (best 
picture, best director for John Schlesinger, best screenplay adaptation for 
Waldo Salt). It was the first and only X-rated film to accomplish all that. In 
fact, it was the first major studio film to be so much as rated X, and its 
importance will always be linked to what that rating meant both then and now. 
</P>
<P>
 When James Leo Herlihy's novel of hustlers and the hustled was published in 
1965, its frankness made it an unlikely movie topic. In fact, a reader for 
United Artists, the studio that eventually made the film, reported that the 
book's action "goes steadily downhill" and recommended against it. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Jerome Hellman, however, believed in the project and persuaded first 
director Schlesinger, whose "Darling" had intrigued American audiences, and 
then UA President David Picker to sign on to what eventually became a 
$3-million movie. 
</P>
<P>
 An Off Broadway actor named Dustin Hoffman, who had yet to make "The 
Graduate," was everyone's choice for one lead, but director Schlesinger had 
Michael Sarrazin in mind for the other. When Sarrazin ended up in "They Shoot 
Horses, Don't They?" the job went to a 30-year-old actor making his 
major-studio debut, Jon Voight. 
</P>
<P>
 Voight was Joe Buck, a Texas dishwasher with a dream, a Candide in cowboy 
boots. Believing in nothing so much as his own talents as a lover, Joe hops a 
bus for New York City. "There're a lot rich women back there," runs his mantra, 
"begging for it, paying for it, and all the men are tutti-frutti." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite his elaborate hopes to be a stud for hire, Joe Buck in his black 
hat, fringed buckskin jacket and cowhide suitcase is the kind of innocent 
Manhattan eats for lunch. His bravado is a thin veneer and can't disguise a 
vulnerable soft touch who couldn't hustle himself out of a paper bag. 
</P>
<P>
 A mark, in short, which is what Enrico Salvatore Rizzo, Ratso to his 
confederates, sees at once. A grown-up Artful Dodger, Ratso with his horrid 
teeth, ragged cough and awkward limp is everything Joe Buck is not, an angry 
bedbug whose native street smarts haven't managed to get him any further along 
in life than the make-believe cowboy's naivete. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally Ratso rips Joe Buck off -- it's his nature -- but a chance meeting 
later on reunites them. And what develops from an uneasy rapprochement is a 
chaste love story with the pathos of "Camille," a brief on loneliness and the 
need for human companionship from characters who gain our sympathy by angrily 
refusing to have anything to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, 25 years makes a difference in how a film is perceived, and to see 
"Midnight Cowboy" now is to notice on the one hand how dated its attitudes 
toward promiscuity and homosexuality seem and on the other how much more 
immediate the subtext of homelessness appears in the light of the 1980s and 
'90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet much about "Midnight Cowboy" remains the same. The things that reviewers 
complained about in 1969 -- the overdone and confusing flashbacks, the 
too-fancy camera work that one critic groused turned the movie into "a kind of 
8th Avenue and 42nd Street 'Dr. Caligari' ' -- are still annoying. And what 
knocked people out 25 years ago, the parallel performances of Voight and 
Hoffman, still have the power today. 
</P>
<P>
 Though both were nominated, neither Voight nor Hoffman won the best actor 
Oscar; it went to the unstoppable John Wayne for his "True Grit" apotheosis. 
And both Voight and Hoffman have gone on to impressive careers, gathering in a 
total of nine Oscar nominations and three victories between them. But seeing 
the two of them again in "Midnight Cowboy" leads inevitably to the conclusion 
that neither one ever did better work. 
</P>
<P>
 Experienced stage actors but still young and relatively new to film, both 
Voight and Hoffman threw themselves into their parts, bringing in addition to 
their energy the confidence that comes with knowing just how rich these roles 
were. Rooted in sympathy for and understanding of the characters and completely 
free of condescension, these performances have only gotten more impressive with 
the passage of time. 
</P>
<P>
 But as well as "Midnight Cowboy" plays today, those who see it now for the 
first time will only understand half of the fuss it caused. Though no one today 
would call the film "generally sordid," as Variety did, or agree with Rex Reed, 
who described it as "a collage of screaming, crawling, vomiting humanity," the 
sense that it was made by adults for adults still exists and that was key to 
all the excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 For no matter how tamely the now R-rated "Midnight Cowboy" may currently play, 
it is important to remember that its candid treatment of the world of Times 
Square hustlers was definitely one step over the line in 1969, and when the 
film agreed to go out with an X, it seemed not a mark of shame but a badge of 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of films constrained by the outmoded Production Code, which made 
even married couples sleep in twin beds, "Midnight Cowboy" made it seem that 
Hollywood was now willing to talk to an adult audience on its own terms, 
willing to be as candid as the best literature in dealing with reality as its 
audience knew it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of a brave new world, the X rating proved the beginning of the end 
for adventurous films. Its original purpose, as a sign to let mature audiences 
know they were being addressed, was overrun in the rush of pornographers eager 
to label their films with the forbidden letter and the equally fervid response 
of groups for whom pornography equaled death. 
</P>
<P>
 What got lost, as it always does, was the middle ground, the great mass of 
Americans who yearn to see films like "Midnight Cowboy" that had the nerve to 
overrun moralistic boundaries but did it with grace and sensitivity and skill. 
</P>
<P>
 While a functioning ratings system would allow filmmakers to dare while 
protecting those who didn't care for daring fare, the breakdown of the current 
arrangement stigmatized the taboo breakers and meant that audiences were being 
denied the modern equivalents of "Midnight Cowboy," robbed of the kinds of bold 
films that will look as good in 25 years as this film does today.* 
</P>
<P>
 * "Midnight Cowboy" opens Friday at the Bruin Theatre in Westwood. The film 
will also open Friday in New York and next month in 10 to 12 other cities 
across the country.

DON'T GET BITTER ON US, BECK; THANKS TO HIS RAP-FOLK SONG 'LOSER,' THE 
23-YEAR-OLD MUSICIAN IS ONE OF THE HOTTEST FIGURES TO EMERGE FROM THE L.A. ROCK 
SCENE IN YEARS. BUT NOW THAT HE'S GOING NATIONAL, HOW WILL HE HOLD UP UNDER ALL 
THE ATTENTION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN, Steve Hochman writes about pop music for Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lot of people are eager to give Beck Hansen advice these days. 
</P>
<P>
 One cautioned the young musician not to become "angry and bitter." 
</P>
<P>
 Another took it even further: 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'Don't choke on your own vomit,' " recalls the singer, who goes by 
his first name, sitting in a small Mexican restaurant near his Highland Park 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to his song "Loser," a rap-folk concoction with witty wordplay, a 
catchy beat and an air of electric currency a la Bob Dylan's "Subterranean 
Homesick Blues," he's seen by some as the hottest and most intriguing new 
figure to emerge from the Los Angeles rock scene since Axl Rose and Perry 
Farrell in the mid-'80s. 
</P>
<P>
 An unknown just months ago and still largely a mystery, Hansen has come out of 
nowhere to become the young man of the moment. And we all know what's happened 
to successful young men of other moments in rock, from Dylan to Jimi Hendrix to 
Eddie Vedder: They become angry and bitter -- or worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Hansen seems so young and frail on first encounter -- he's 23 
but looks about half his age -- makes people especially protective of him. 
There's an almost waif-like air to him, a sense of wide-eyed, vulnerable 
sincerity mixed with a sparkle of mischief in his penchant for obtuse, 
stream-of-consciousness statements.  
</P>
<P>
 Even the team of professional advisers that has now assembled around him on 
the eve of the March 1 release of his first major-label album, "Mellow Gold," 
seems oddly in dread of the very stardom that it feels is inevitable for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep telling Beck that he's the guy who has to walk down the street and be 
recognized," says Mark Kates, the Geffen Records A&R director who signed Hansen 
to a deal in December after a fierce competition with Warner Bros. and Capitol. 
"He should enjoy his anonymity while it lasts, because when it goes, it goes." 
</P>
<P>
 And it's going fast. Before last summer, Hansen was virtually unknown, and to 
those who had encountered him he was something of an enigma, jumping on stage 
between acts at Los Angeles clubs and coffeehouses to play strange folk songs 
or, sometimes wearing a "Star Wars" storm trooper mask, do what could best be 
described as performance art. 
</P>
<P>
 Then last summer "Loser" started turning up on college stations KCRW and KXLU 
and eventually commercial outlets around the country, including L.A.'s KROQ. 
Before long his performances were drawing record-label scouts by the dozens. 
Hansen's shows were still the unrefined and seemingly uncommercial 
presentations as before, but there was such a buzz that even before he was 
formally offered a record deal there was talk of "bidding wars" and "hype."  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't really know what an A&R person was until maybe last July," Hansen 
confesses. "I thought an A&R person was like somebody who worked at A&M 
(Records). I had A&R and A&M mixed up." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, though, he is on a major label, surrounded by a powerful brain trust that 
includes John Silva, the manager of Nirvana, Sonic Youth and the Lemonheads. 
It's overseeing a ballooning career that Hansen says he never really pursued 
and is still not sure he wants. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen seems almost blithely oblivious to the fame that may be headed his way. 
Though "Loser" has been called "the ultimate slacker anthem," he believes its 
success is merely a fluke of luck and timing.  
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't intended as (an anthem)," he says. "It was just goofing around at a 
friend's house on an eight-track. There's a lot of ideas floating around in the 
song, but it wasn't meant to be some like triumphant message." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, the record, originally released last summer by tiny Bongload 
Records, has been No. 1 on Billboard magazine's modern rock chart, with the 30 
radio stations that report for the chart playing the song an average of more 
than 20 times a week.  
</P>
<P>
 And that raises a second fear: that Hansen will be a one-hit wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him, 'You gotta make sure this isn't the peak of your career,' " Kates 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Geffen executive believes he's dealing with an artist who can take 
care of himself: "He's a smart guy. I'm not that worried about him." 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen has plenty of experience taking care of himself. His childhood was 
spent shuttling between his office-worker single mother in Los Angeles and his 
grandparents in Kansas, where his grandfather was a Presbyterian minister. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was left to my own devices a lot," he says of his youth.  
</P>
<P>
 He dropped out of school after junior high ("I woulda got my ass kicked in 
high school") and worked a stream of menial jobs including loading trucks and 
being "a leaf-blower guy."

<P>
 It wasn't until he was 17 that music entered his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was at a friend's house and we were hanging out and his dad had a bunch of 
records," he recalls. "He had this Mississippi John Hurt record and the cover 
was just a close-up shot of his sweating, old face and it looked pretty cool. 
So I stole it.  
</P>
<P>
 "It totally blew me away. I'd never heard music like that before, but it was 
exactly the kind of music I wanted to hear. I wasn't into that much music 
before. I was into some punk bands, I liked Pussy Galore when I was like 14 or 
15. But this was so great." 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by the venerable singer-guitarist, Hansen explored blues and folk 
music further, learning how to finger-pick guitar and discovering such icons as 
Woody Guthrie and Blind Willie Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these old people, they were the original punk rock," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he moved with his girlfriend to New York and found himself part of a 
music community. 
</P>
<P>
 "She disappeared and I was kinda left to my own devices again," he says. "So I 
kinda started hanging out on the street in the Lower East Side. I had my guitar 
and there was this whole kinda punk-rock-folk scene and noise- music- chaos- 
poetry- underground- basement- 40-ounce- malt-liquor- being- crazy scene going 
on." 
</P>
<P>
 He fell in with the likes of folk singer Roger Manning and members of the 
bands King Missile and Galaxie 500 and played on shows at small clubs and 
coffeehouses. In 1990, daunted by the prospect of another New York winter, 
Hansen returned to L.A. and gradually tested the waters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was working in a video store and living in this rooming house over in Los 
Feliz and I would hang out at the Onyx (coffeehouse) and sometimes just bring 
my guitar and play a few songs," he says. "They gave me a show there and I met 
some guy who had a tape recorder in his living room and we went and made a 
tape, and I started making these tapes and passing them around."  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Slowly he started to attract a handful of music industry supporters. One, Rob 
Schnapf, had just started Bongload Records with his partners Tom Rothrock and 
Brad Lambert. After seeing Hansen play at Jabberjaw, Schnapf felt he would suit 
their small venture. 
</P>
<P>
 A loose comment by Hansen about a developing interest in rap led Schnapf to 
hook him up with Karl Stephenson, a young hip-hop producer. Hansen went to 
Stephenson's house, played a slide guitar lick that the producer sampled and 
surrounded with a solid beat, and started spewing out stream-of-consciousness 
lyrics that, intentionally or otherwise, summed up the experience of the young 
and the aimless.  
</P>

</P>
<P>

<P>

<P>
 I'm a loser baby  
</P>
<P>
 So why don't you kill me  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Loser" was really just a one-off experiment, and Hansen put the track aside 
and went back to his folk songs, making his home tapes and releasing several 
independent singles. "Loser" sat for a full year, until the Bongload guys asked 
if they could release it as a single.  
</P>
<P>
 Then the explosion happened. Geffen A&R man Tony Berg was struck by the song 
and played it for KCRW music director Chris Douridas, who played the song on 
his "Morning Becomes Eclectic" show. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of those unbelievable finds," says Douridas. "I called the record 
label that day and asked to have Beck play live on the air. He came in that 
Friday, rapped to a tape of 'Loser' and did his song 'MTV Makes Me Want to 
Smoke Crack.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The impact was immediate. Hansen played that night at the downtown club Cafe 
Troy and the place was packed, and soon the scouts were sniffing around. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen was flabbergasted.  
</P>
<P>
 "I never really wanted to draw attention to myself," he says. "I was just 
going to do my thing and play for friends of mine and make up songs about 
people that we knew and making up jokes that only my friends could understand." 
</P>
<P>
 He even seriously considered not signing a deal with any record company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided (not to sign) a few times," he says, insisting that money was never 
an issue with him. "I didn't want to fall into some situation where I had to be 
something I wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, though, the Geffen team convinced him that he would be able to do 
things his way with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were willing to take the music on its own terms and take a chance," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Geffen's got Beck, what do they do with him? 
</P>
<P>
 "With something that has developed a life of its own, the only thing a major 
label can do is get in the way and mess it up," says Geffen's Kates. 
</P>
<P>
 So the strategy is pretty much to stay out of the way. First of all, the deal 
Hansen got is notable for the creative freedom it allows him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I come up with songs, I give 'em to 'em, they say, 'Great,' press 'em up and 
put 'em out," Hansen summarizes. 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond that, Geffen has given him a non-exclusive contract, meaning Hansen 
remains free to release material through such small, independent labels as 
Bongload and Flipside. 
</P>
<P>
 Of more concern to Geffen's marketing and promotion staff, "Mellow Gold" is 
not an album full of "Losers." Fans of the hit may well be taken aback by its 
rough folk songs and blasts of experimental noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Kates sees the diversity as more a blessing than a curse, but it's still a big 
challenge to the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that because of 'Loser' we have this platform for people to check out 
what he's about," Kates says. "He's a complex guy, both musically and 
personally. So we'll do what we would have done without a major hit. We don't 
want to overestimate people's interest in him. But we're confident that when 
people see him and hear the extent of his music they'll like him even more." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is for Hansen to hit the road with a band he's now assembling, 
playing for the most part in the same small clubs he would have been in without 
the hit. And to follow "Loser," Geffen will release "Pay No Mind," a relatively 
straight, folk-type song.  
</P>
<P>
 As for the press, the big bugaboo for Vedder and others, Hansen has few 
qualms, at least for now.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, it's just talking to someone," he says. "It's just a bunch of words." 
</P>
<P>
 His main interest is just to keep exploring music, writing songs about his 
experiences and playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not doing this for some kind of big giant rock explosive overpowering 
transcendent feeling," he says. "There's nothing like that. It's just me 
getting up there and speaking my mind about anything and basically saying 
anybody can get up and do this. That's the whole point -- pick up an acoustic 
guitar, everybody's got ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "(People are) just fed all this stuff, all these CDs they have to buy, all 
these TV shows they gotta watch, all these, um, Pop Tarts they gotta toast. But 
(people have) plenty of songs themselves and they just don't realize they can 
get up there and just do it. It's not such a holy thing. You know, eat a 
burrito, write a song."*

HAS BLACK COMEDY BEEN BEATEN BLUE?; 'DEF COMEDY JAM' IS A HIT -- BUT WITH SOME 
AFRICAN AMERICAN COMICS TURNING TO CABLE SHOWS THAT LIMIT THE RAUNCHINESS, 
CLEAN AND SUBTLE COULD BE THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The makeshift "green room" at the Ebony Showcase Theatre in South-Central Los 
Angeles was filled with the sweet smell of fresh soul food and the sting of 
dueling punch lines from comedians waiting their turn to "kick it" with the 
overflow crowd waiting in the jammed theater downstairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Seasoned veterans of the African American comic scene -- T. K. Carson from 
"The Sinbad Show" and John Henton from "Living Single" -- mixed easily with 
aspiring comics while a monitor showed the live proceedings taking place below. 
</P>
<P>
 Onstage, comedian Paul Mooney, wearing a blue scarf over his head, was saying, 
"White people are always trying to bring big dead white people back to life, 
like Elvis. You don't ever hear anybody saying, 'Hey, I just saw Sammy Davis 
Jr. shopping at the supermarket.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The predominantly black audience roared its approval as cameras rolled. The 
steady stream of comedians had gathered for a marathon taping session of "Comic 
Justice," Comedy Central's showcase for black comedians and vintage film clips 
honoring black entertainers from the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Comic Justice" is one of a series of existing and proposed programs fashioned 
after "Russell Simmons' Def Comedy Jam," the HBO late-night showcase that has 
propelled the grass-roots popularity of black stand-up comedy into the national 
mainstream. The 3-year-old show has given unprecedented exposure to young 
performers who use comedy to express their anger and observations about growing 
up black. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet "Def Comedy Jam" has become just as infamous for the unabashed rawness and 
profanity used by many of the comedians in depicting X-rated sex and raunchy 
behavior -- no-holds-barred material that might make even fans of Richard 
Pryor, Redd Foxx or Eddie Murphy blush. And that has created a backlash. 
Comedians at the "Comic Justice" taping said the success of the HBO series has 
been a double-edged sword, making black comedians a hot commodity but creating 
an expectation among audiences and club owners that all black comics must be 
blue. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, "Comic Justice" was conceived last year in response to "Def Comedy 
Jam" as a showcase for "clean" black comedians. "We're trying to aspire to a 
higher energy," explained Jerry Kramer, the show's director and co-producer. 
"You can be funny without saying (expletive) before every noun. You can talk 
about any issue without cursing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival of "Comic Justice" and other black stand-up shows, such as 
"Comicview" on Black Entertainment Television, comes as "Def Comedy Jam" 
continues to grow far beyond its limited audience at HBO. Two "best of" 
compilations are available in video stores. Groups of comedians traveling under 
the "Def Comedy Jam" banner have been playing to sold-out audiences around the 
country, and future tours are planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Comics featured on the show continue to be feverishly courted by the networks 
as performers or writers. A special, "Bad Girls of Def," is scheduled on HBO in 
July, and "Def Jam" producers have been working on a toned-down version of 
their show that they hope to sell to a network. The series has even spawned a 
Latino version, "Loco Slam," which will air on HBO in June ( see story , Page 
62 ). 
</P>
<P>
 Comedians at the "Comic Justice" taping acknowledged the groundbreaking nature 
of "Def Comedy Jam" and praised the series for helping black comedians make 
inroads. But they and others maintain that the show's edgy style of humor has 
promoted an overemphasis among black comics on raunchy, in-your-face comedy 
rather than on more subtle, insightful humor. Much of the "Def Jam" humor, they 
charge, is degrading to women, employs racial epithets and uses stereotypes 
that portray black men and women as oversexed, loud and profane. 
</P>
<P>
 And young audiences, particularly those who like rap music, now expect black 
comics to perform "Def Jam"-style material. 
</P>
<P>
 "Audiences who have been attending comedy clubs haven't changed, but there is 
a new audience out there, the hip-hop audience, and the 'Def Jam' stuff is what 
they want to see," said A. J. Jamal, the host of "Comic Justice." "I've 
performed in front of mixed audiences, and young brothers will come up to me 
afterward and say, 'I guess you couldn't let yourself go off or talk about 
somebody's mama because there were white people in the audience, right?' Then I 
have to tell them I don't do that type of material." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jamal and others also complain that aspiring comics, influenced by "Def Comedy 
Jam," think they can get by with just a few minutes of raunchy jokes without 
providing a social context or a personal identity such as a Richard Pryor or a 
Redd Foxx. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Richard Pryor, you never knew the cursing was there," said Jamal, a 
former regular on Fox's "In Living Color." "It was brilliant. Now it's 'F this' 
and 'F that,' 'N this' and 'N that.' Like, where's the joke? These guys don't 
even introduce themselves. They just start right off saying those words. Why 
does it have to be so violent, and why does there have to be so much bad 
language?" 
</P>
<P>
 The creators and producers of "Def Comedy Jam" bristle at the blasts against 
their program, saying that critics have the wrong impression about the show and 
the style of comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not look for blue or raw material," said Stan Lathan, "Def Comedy 
Jam's" director and one of the executive producers. "When we sold this show to 
HBO, it was conceived as a show where we could present a club setting that was 
real and pure. We do not tell any of the comics what to say or what to do. 
There are lots of comics who do clean sets." 
</P>
<P>
 Lathan continued: "Sure, there is a lot of blue stuff on the show, a lot of 
extremely graphic sexual material. But this is the material that these comics 
do in the clubs. We're presenting the purest state of black American comedy. 
This is a fact." 
</P>
<P>
 Rap music mogul Russell Simmons, who created "Def Comedy Jam" and is another 
one of its three executive producers, said: "Black comics have a real forum on 
'Def Jam,' not these other places. No matter what anyone says, it's an honest 
expression of our culture. There is absolutely no emphasis on being dirty. The 
emphasis is on being honest." 
</P>
<P>
 Lathan, a television veteran who is also producer and director of Fox's "Roc," 
said: "I understand the sensitivity of many black people to the images that are 
presented on our show. I agree in many cases that television does a disservice 
to black people. But 'Def Comedy Jam' is a show that's on very late at night on 
an adult pay-TV network. It's available to a very limited audience. It's not in 
your face at 8:30 or 9 p.m. on the networks." 
</P>
<P>
 Mooney, a former writer for Richard Pryor and a veteran of the comedy scene, 
calls the finger-pointing "just more black-on-black crime. 'Def Jam' is part of 
the black experience. If things were equal, there wouldn't be a need for a 'Def 
Jam.' People need to get hip to that. " 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the creators of "Comic Justice" and "Comicview" say their 
programs provide a timely and essential alternative to prove that black doesn't 
have to be blue. Comedians appearing on the shows are told to check their 
four-letter and 12-letter obscenities, as well as their more sexually explicit 
material, at the door. Though some references to drugs and urban ills remain, 
the comics' delivery is closer to "Ed Sullivan" than "Def Comedy Jam." 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Wiseman of M. L. Management, which produces "Comic Justice" in 
association with Visualize Productions, said he and colleagues developed the 
show because "clean" black comedians needed a television showcase. "We wanted 
to focus on family values and honesty. We interview everyone beforehand, and 
all the comedians, including the ones who use profanity in their act, know this 
is a positive thing we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Adkins, Wiseman's partner, said: "For some of these comedians, it's a 
relief for them to do clean comedy. They can't use profanity, so they are 
challenged to do their comedy another way. This kind of show increases their 
marketability." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to showcasing comics, "Comic Justice" also spotlights vintage film 
clips featuring Hattie McDaniel, Eddie (Rochester) Anderson, Sammy Davis Jr. 
and vaudeville teams. "It's important to show the legacy," Wiseman said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike "Comic Justice," which features more established comics, BET's 
"Comicview" is designed as a competition for up-and-coming black comedians. The 
comics are told to do "clean and original" material, which is then judged by a 
panel of entertainment industry professionals. Weekly winners are eligible to 
star in their own half-hour comedy special. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Taylor, producer and director of "Comicview," said that though her show 
was not developed as a direct reaction to "Def Comedy Jam," "we thought there 
was a need for a lot of good and talented comics who do not use profanity in 
their acts. We wanted to show that you could enjoy this kind of comedy without 
having to send the kids or the grandparents out of the room." 
</P>
<P>
 Actor-comedian Dave Chappelle said he thought it was about time that shows 
like "Comicview" and "Comic Justice" came along: " 'Def Jam' is cool; it's a 
good thing. I just think people should realize it's not the only thing. There 
has to be a balance." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chappelle said "Def Jam" has definitely had an influence on the expectations 
of audiences and club owners toward black comedians: "You have to remember, 
when 'Def Jam' started, it was huge. It was a lot of white people's first 
introduction to (that kind of stand-up) comedy, and it's what they thought it 
was all about. I found when I was touring that, in a lot of people's minds, 
especially young people, your comedy was not as colorful if you were less blue. 
And club owners, when they would see that I'm young and black, would be 
reluctant to deal with me, saying: 'He's one of those "Def Jam" comics.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ajai Sanders, a comedian who was also a regular on NBC's "A Different World," 
said she had not planned to perform blue material when she appeared on "Def 
Comedy Jam" two years ago. But she said she altered her routine because of the 
audience: "When I was on 'Def Jam,' the pressure to be dirty was really there." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of her routine centered on the simulation of a sexually explicit act 
between her and her boyfriend. The young crowd responded enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Def Jam' started out as a venue where a comic could be fly but clever," 
Sanders said. "Now the cleverness has been thrown out. It's about time we had a 
show like 'Comic Justice.' We need this and 'Def Comedy Jam.' I like this 
better. I'm more comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she said she is grateful for the exposure she received from "Def 
Comedy Jam" ("I couldn't go anywhere without people recognizing me"), Sanders 
said she would never go on the show again: "I just feel like I need to 
challenge myself more." 
</P>
<P>
 Chappelle said he just taped his second "Jam" session, and "it went really 
well. The first time I did it, I was a bit blue, but this time, I was more 
myself. It was a show of all clean comedians." 
</P>
<P>
 Jamal and others said they believe that the raw style of black comedy is a 
passing phase. "Eventually clean comedy will come back, comedy that is 
mainstream, where the language will be more like Bill Cosby," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lathan said that he is not threatened by the competition and that there is 
room for all the black comedy shows, blue and non-blue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all feed each other," he said. "We as black producers are all going to 
benefit -- there's no question about it. It's gone from the grass roots to the 
mainstream, and we can have every aspect of the spectrum. And the whole 
entertainment industry will take on a flavor that will be a little more 
black."* 
</P>
<P>
 * "Comic Justice" airs Saturdays at 11 p.m. and Sundays at 10:30 p.m. on 
Comedy Central. (The episodes taped in Los Angeles will start airing in April.) 
"Comicview" can be seen nightly at 5:30 and 10 o'clock on BET. "Def Comedy Jam" 
airs Fridays at midnight and in various other late-night slots during the week 
on HBO.

THE LITTLE LADY AND THE VAMP; LINDSAY RIDGEWAY'S CRIMINAL-MINDED TYKE AND LOREN 
FREEMAN'S AGENT IN DRAG HAVE COMBINED MAKE THE SHOW-BIZ SENDUP 'RUTHLESS!' A 
HIT WITH BOTH THE MAINSTREAM-WITH-KIDS CROWD AND A HIPPER, GAY CONTINGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A row of extravagant hats, wigs and giant feathered who-knows-whats is perched 
on the ledge above the mirror. Actor Loren Freeman sits in front of the glass, 
facing a dressing table filled with containers of colored goop, as he paints 
layer upon layer of the stuff on his face. 
</P>
<P>
 The nightly transformation into agent Sylvia St. Croix, his role (and the only 
cross-dressed part) in "Ruthless!" -- a musical at the Canon Theatre in Beverly 
Hills -- is no quickie. Sylvia is a vamp. But, then, so's the dinky blond Tina, 
played by 8-year-old Lindsay Ridgeway, who's hanging out by his side. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody upstages these gals. So hold onto your feather boas and check your 
powder, dolls. You have now entered the "Ruthless!" zone. 
</P>
<P>
 A "Beach Blanket Babylon" for Sam Yorty voters and Jerry Dunphy fans, 
"Ruthless!" is a show-biz sendup with book and lyrics by Joel Paley, music by 
Marvin Laird and costumes by Bob Mackie. It's the story of Tina, a budding but 
criminal child star, and the women who surround her, including her daffy stage 
mom, a pushy agent and an acerbic critic. 
</P>
<P>
 When the show opened at the Canon Theatre in November, many critics responded 
with enthusiasm. Sylvie Drake, The Times' theater critic emeritus, called it 
"ruthlessly unredeemable fun." What makes this show stand out, though, is that 
it has been attracting two very different kinds of audiences: the mainstream, 
even family-dominated crowd, and a hipper, gay contingent. 
</P>
<P>
 "One night there was a birthday party for 12-year-old girls and they were 
sitting next to leather queens," says Joan Stein, who produced this West Coast 
premiere with Elizabeth Williams. "It's unusual to have a show where 
grandparents, parents, kids and people with a different lifestyle can come." 
</P>
<P>
 "With a show that has a camp sensibility, a lot of times that does appeal to a 
more diverse audience," Freeman says. "I wouldn't want to do a show that was 
just for the Beverly Hills people or just for the avant-garde Santa Monica 
Boulevard group. That's too insular." 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman, in fact, may be partly responsible for the crossover. His work with 
precocious co-star Ridgeway is central to the show's ability to appeal to two 
such ostensibly different crowds. And their rapport is emblematic of the show's 
achievement: 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman: "Tell her the new thing he (director Joel Paley ) put in today . . . 
about the crowbar."  
</P>
<P>
 Ridgeway: "Well, I kill for the part in the play that the other girl gets. So 
I say, 'I wrapped a jump - rope around her fat neck and hit her in the knee 
with a crowbar and pushed her over the side of the catwalk.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Freeman: "Get it? Tonya Harding. Lindsay understands where the jokes are and 
she knows how to play them, the way a lot of other people her age don't. I 
think about people that you're just show business or you're not. And she is."  
</P>
<P>
 Ridgeway: "Thank you, Loren."  
</P>
<P>
 Freeman: "You're welcome."  
</P>
<P>
 Ridgeway: "I'm giving him 20 bucks for that."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They're an odd couple all right, even if they both do like to camp it up. 
Freeman, in fact, acknowledges that he had some initial apprehensions. Actors, 
after all, are traditionally warned about sharing the stage with children, 
puppies or helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had been a while since I'd worked with a little kid," he says. "But we 
just started joking around so that she knew that I was a nice person and that I 
liked her. We tried to get comfortable with one another. Then we just ran with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman, 34, a native San Franciscan, trained at the American Conservatory 
Theatre and the Pacific Conservatory of the Performing Arts. He spent eight 
years in New York, before moving to Los Angeles four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And though Freeman has logged his share of TV ("Murphy Brown," "Love & War," 
"Who's the Boss?") and film roles ("Lionheart") since then, he didn't make his 
local stage debut until 1992. He won an L.A. Weekly award for his portrayal of 
the flamboyant Sammy Farrell in "Melody Jones," the Dan Gerrity-Jeremy Lawrence 
adaptation of the David Galloway book, directed by Ron Link at the Cast 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 A dark, brooding play set in a strip joint fronting for a gay bar, "Melody 
Jones" certainly wasn't the kind of place you'd find a nice girl like Lindsay 
Ridgeway. 
</P>
<P>
 But anyway, Ridgeway was only 6 then. She was born in Riverside -- where her 
parents, Lee and Ron, and sister Kelly, 7, still live -- and first performed at 
age 4 with the Riverside Civic Light Opera. Since then she's worked in 
commercials, TV (she's currently a member of the Prank Patrol on "America's 
Funniest People") and the theater (the touring company of "Annie Warbucks"). 
</P>
<P>
 "Ruthless!" threw Freeman and Ridgeway together. And, coincidentally, the two 
actors share a droll, nearly deadpan sensibility, not to mention the 
all-important comic timing. They're both kidders (so to speak), off stage and 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 "He reminds me of Jack Benny meets Paul Lynde and Roz Russell," director Link 
says of Freeman. "He's an actor who's not afraid to cross that gender-bending 
line, who's good in reality but isn't afraid of superficiality. I think of him 
as a consummate clown, and he has a natural manic dark side." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And while Freeman garnered a following for his work in "Melody Jones," he's 
now acquiring a fan club of ladies who lunch. "Matinee ladies talk about my 
legs now," he says. "They're a little meaty for my taste, but I guess they like 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 The approval may also be because Freeman doesn't play St. Croix simply as a 
drag caricature. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a character, which is what I like," he says. "There's never anything 
revealed (that indicates that) I'm a man. I don't think about the drag part 
when I'm up there. There are no drag jokes." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, his image for the character is as mainstream as a certain Andrew 
Lloyd Webber musical now playing in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was 22, somebody cast me as Don Quixote in 'Man of La Mancha' and I 
didn't know what to do," Freeman recalls. "So I did what I'm doing in this: 
Norma Desmond, the Grand Guignol. (St. Croix) is tragic and there are funny 
things that happen to her, but she's not a comedic character." 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge is to keep that high emotional pitch without sacrificing all of 
the character's veracity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a funny thing when you're out there playing real moments in this 
overblown setting," Freeman says. "That's really where the humor is, in the 
absurdity of the setting and the Bob Mackie clothes and the cartoonish 
ambience. I would like to be bigger than life. I think all actors would. I 
don't think any of us want to be down to earth. It's boring down there." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are on Earth, Loren," adds Ridgeway, who says Tina is "not like any other 
character that I've played; it's a funnier part." And Ridgeway plays Tina with 
an attitude that makes it seem as though she gets all the inside jokes. She 
also gets high marks from her co-workers: 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman: "She's solid."  
</P>
<P>
 Ridgeway: "What does that mean, Loren?"  
</P>
<P>
 Freeman: "You don't goof up too much."  
</P>
<P>
 Ridgeway: "No. (pause) Joan Ryan does."  
</P>
<P>
 If Ryan, who plays Tina's mother, minds the jab from her short-statured 
colleague, she doesn't let on. "Lindsay is so professional it's frightening," 
she says. "You know something's off if Lindsay is looking around. She can 
notice 1,000 things at once." 
</P>
<P>
 There have, in fact, been a number of times when Ridgeway has been put to the 
test. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the second act, she comes out in a coat with an outfit underneath," says 
Ryan, referring to Tina's reappearance in prison togs. "Well, (one time) she 
had gotten dressed in a hurry and was trailing a hanger. I cracked up. But 
Lindsay just looked at me. And I thought, 'Who is the adult here?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I took (the hanger) off and put it on the coffee table," Ridgeway says. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Producers Stein and Williams could only wish for such a savvy young lead when 
they first saw "Ruthless!" during its Off Broadway run last year. But what they 
saw for sure was a show that was pulling in the same mix of gay and straight 
ticket buyers that it's now attracting here. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ability to reach a diverse audience was one of the things that attracted 
us to the show," Stein says. "It's been greater than we expected, but we hoped 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't just hope, though -- they strategized. "My partner Elizabeth 
(Williams) and I have made a concerted effort to try and reach diverse 
audiences -- from offering discount coupons on the back of grocery receipts, 
which generally reach homemakers, to having Loren Freeman appearing in costume 
and singing at a gay club called the Revolver," Stein says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ruthless!" has advertised in the gay press and taken part in the Gay and 
Lesbian Exhibition, a trade show of organizations owned, run by or catering to 
members of the gay and lesbian community. The "Ruthless" booth sold show 
tickets and T-shirts and also had costumed cast members on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We both have backgrounds in marketing," says Stein, who, like Williams, is an 
Off Broadway veteran. "Elizabeth also produced 'Crazy for You' (in New York), 
which also has a big crossover audience, so we were able to examine some 
marketing plans from that." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with canvassing the gay community, the producers have also been 
targeting school groups. "Kids love seeing other kids on-stage," Stein says. 
"We have a lot of school groups that come, and we've invited principals and 
teachers to the show beforehand, because there's a dark side and they have to 
be the ones to say if it's OK." 
</P>
<P>
 That dark side, however, might suggest to some that "Ruthless!" isn't kiddie 
fare. "The things that are going on onstage are not as horrible as the things 
going on in the news, with Nancy Kerrigan," Stein says. "I haven't had any 
complaints from people who've brought their kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Ridgeway says children aren't likely to pick up Tina's naughty behavior: "They 
understand that it's, like, only a play and that I wouldn't really do that and 
that nobody else would do that. They know it's just fake." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor, she says, is she herself likely to go rotten. "I know that I'm really not 
to say those things when I'm not performing," Ridgeway says. "It's just part of 
the play and it's my character that says it. I would describe her as . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "Bad?" Freeman offers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bad, yeah -- when she's at school and not around her mom," Ridgeway 
continues. "And she's real sweet, like she doesn't really know anything about 
what she did when she's with her mother. I get the wig when I kill Louise, and 
I say, 'What wig?' and pretend I don't know anything." 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the dark side of the play is harmless, that still doesn't mean 
"Ruthless!" is a kiddie show. Stein and Williams' marketing notwithstanding, 
the humor is mostly made up of inside jokes that play off such old movies as 
"The Bad Seed," "All About Eve" and "Gypsy." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not really for kids," Ridgeway says. "Kids would like some of the 
characters -- the teacher is really funny; she always wears pencils in her hair 
-- and the dancing. But they really wouldn't get some of the jokes." 
</P>
<P>
 "What about your friends who came on Sunday?" prompts Lindsay's real-life 
mother, Lee Ridgeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsay, who plans to be a dance teacher and a whale trainer as well as an 
actress, doesn't budge on this one. 
</P>
<P>
 This, after all, is an actress who knows where she stands and how to take 
things in stride. Drag, for instance, isn't necessarily something they teach 
you about in third grade. 
</P>
<P>
 But it really hasn't been a big deal getting to know about these matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weirdest part was at the audition," Freeman says. "I had heard that 
(other actors) came in drag, and I said, 'Well, then I have to do it too.' The 
first moment, I thought, 'The poor little girl's gonna wonder why I'm wearing 
this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ridgeway, however, had been prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody told me that a man plays the part of Sylvia, and I thought, 'You 
know, I better warn Lindsay about this,' " says Lee Ridgeway, who accompanies 
her daughter to every show. "We were going into the parking lot, and I said, 
'There may be some guys here dressed like girls.' So when she finally did see 
them, Lindsay just went over and said, 'Oh.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "There were three of us," Freeman says. "We looked like real-estate agents." 
</P>
<P>
 Ridgeway: "I'm really not used to seeing men dressed as women and it's new to 
me. At first it was, I dunno . . . I had to get used to it."  
</P>
<P>
 Freeman (sotto voce): "She's from Riverside. You know."  
</P>
<P>
 Ridgeway: "And you're from San Francisco."  
</P>
<P>
 Freeman: "That says it all."

DAVE'S SIX-MONTH CHECKUP; WHY DID DAVID LETTERMAN BECOME A NICER GUY? WHY THEN 
DOESN'T HE LAY OFF NBC? IS HE GLAD THE RATINGS ARE GREAT?; WHERE THE HECK IS 
JAY LENO IN ALL THIS? IS DAVE REALLY HAPPY? DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO ASK? WELL, WE 
WERE JUST CURIOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, Rick Du Brow is The Times' television writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "We all went into this with more than a little sense of dread," says David 
Letterman, sizing up his late-night CBS show, which has become the talk of 
television. "I was worried about being embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
 But half a year now has passed since CBS' "Late Show With David Letterman" 
debuted, and it has taken off like a rocket in its head-to-head competition 
with "The Tonight Show" -- where NBC had rejected him as the heir to Johnny 
Carson, giving the plum job to Jay Leno instead. 
</P>
<P>
 In that half year, Letterman has turned late-night TV around, doing what no 
other performer has ever done -- stripping NBC of the "Tonight Show" dominance 
that it had established for nearly four decades under Steve Allen, Jack Paar 
and Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 Leno, as NBC repeatedly points out, is doing well himself -- and steadily 
improving -- in the ratings competition. But in that case, the Letterman series 
is a phenomenon. As of audience measurements through Feb. 6, it had defeated 
"Tonight" for 23 consecutive weeks in the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 If the pattern continues, NBC, which believed that Letterman had a cultish and 
essentially limited audience appeal -- fine for 12:35 a.m. but not mainstream 
enough for 11:35 p.m. -- will be stuck with the reputation of committing one of 
the major blunders in television history by allowing the comedian to get away. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC Entertainment executives declined to compare the two shows or their stars 
at this point. What they are hoping for, of course, is a late-night replay of 
the tortoise and the hare, in which Leno would weather the storm and eventually 
reclaim the top spot, vindicating NBC's judgment. What is certain, however, is 
that regardless of the eventual statistical outcome, Letterman has given 
late-night TV and CBS a huge shot in the arm -- and much sooner than even his 
most ardent supporters thought possible. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Letterman and his co-executive producers, Peter Lassally and Robert Morton, 
concur that they are all surprised at the quick payoff -- especially since 
their "Late Show" started with only two-thirds of CBS stations carrying it in 
its regular time slot against the 100% affiliate clearance of "The Tonight 
Show." 
</P>
<P>
 But Letterman the showman clearly had given his new gig and his image at 11:35 
p.m. some serious thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think David did a remarkable job in reinventing himself," says Lassally, 
who formerly worked on "The Tonight Show" with Carson. "I know the obvious 
things to see are that he wears suits and nice clothes. But his whole attitude 
is completely different. He's warmer and friendlier and has more energy than 
ever before. He used to have the tag on him of being mean-spirited, and that 
tag has been destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
 How intentional was that? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was very intentional," says Lassally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peter is exactly right," Letterman says of the changes. "And the only thing I 
can liken it to is, you meet a girl and you fall in love with her and now it's 
time to meet her parents and you want to make absolutely sure you make the best 
impression possible on these people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that was the kind of pressure I felt going from 12:30 to 11:30 -- new 
people you want to make an impression on. I know what my limitations are. I 
know the kind of mistakes I can make. And I just wanted to make absolutely 
certain that I could sidestep them." 
</P>
<P>
 Does that mean he decided to ease up on the show's edginess, a trademark of 
his 11-year NBC series? Has he gotten feedback from people who think he has 
become too nice a guy on CBS? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I've not heard that. I would guess that maybe people feel that. I don't 
think there has been a marked change, but I was bound and determined to get rid 
of the idea that I was mean to my guests. I believe that was something that was 
established early in the old show and just became part of the myth." 
</P>
<P>
 It is, of course, not myth to say that Letterman's appeal is based partly on 
his instincts for the jugular. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying I wasn't ever mean to guests," he says, adding that the 
reputation "was difficult for us to get out from under. That was the one goal I 
set for myself. I said, 'I just don't want this anymore,' because in my mind I 
was never being mean to guests. Yes, I could understand how it could be 
perceived that way, and of course perception is reality. So that was probably 
one thing that I would have at the top of my list: OK, whatever you have to do, 
don't let people have the reaction that you're being mean to somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 For Morton, other factors came into play in the move to CBS: "To do well with 
only 65% live clearance (now up to 80%) is almost shocking -- like having one 
arm tied behind your back -- but just getting the job has been such a kick in 
the pants for the staff. It's driven David to a quality level that's awesome. 
At NBC the last few years, we felt like bastard kids -- 'Let them do their 
little show at 12:30.' 
</P>
<P>
 "When we premiered (on CBS last Aug. 30), David saw the crown was up for grabs 
and went for it. NBC didn't realize that David Letterman was a franchise 
player. I think Jay Leno is very good but not a franchise. NBC did not think 
David could play at 11:30, and they misjudged it." 
</P>
<P>
 NBC's notion that Letterman -- an influential and money-making performer -- 
might have remained on the network at 12:35 a.m., in effect playing second 
fiddle to Leno, is hard to fathom. No way, says Letterman. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's even sillier," he says, "toward the end of my time at NBC, they came 
up with a plan whereby I would stay at NBC at 12:30, and then in May of '94, I 
would take over 'The Tonight Show.' 
</P>
<P>
 "And I considered it for a while. And occasionally we laugh about it because 
if I had done that, Conan O'Brien (Letterman's replacement on NBC) would still 
be a writer, I would still be doing 12:30 and we would still be waiting to do 
our show in May. And that's just completely ludicrous now. I can't even imagine 
why I would consider that for half a second. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did feel that when Jay got 'The Tonight Show,' for me that was really when 
my relationship with the network ended because I felt emotionally and in a real 
visceral sense that this doesn't make any sense -- that you have Jay Leno and 
then you have me. What's the point? You're duplicating programming. I think Jay 
Leno and Conan O'Brien make perfect sense. But not me." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Letterman acknowledges that he considered the eleventh-hour NBC offer 
because he had wanted to succeed Carson on "The Tonight Show" for so long. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, sure. Yeah. It was something that I took very seriously. I remember the 
day we were talking to Michael Ovitz (his agent), and he said, 'You have two 
offers. One is NBC: Take over "The Tonight Show" in May of 1994. Or you go in 
the next three months, six months, to CBS and start your own show.' Michael 
Ovitz said, 'We strongly suggest that you take the CBS offer.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we were all hoping there was a slight chance we could go to Burbank 
and start doing 'The Tonight Show.' But Peter (Lassally), who had been working 
long and hard to get 'The Tonight Show' after it had been given to Jay, and 
Morty (Morton) said, 'No, you can't take "The Tonight Show" under these 
circumstances.' So I wrestled with it for two or three days, and then I finally 
realized you have to take this chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, too much had happened. It would have been so unpleasant. It would 
have appeared that Jay would have been ousted from his job. And you know, he 
wanted that job as much or more than I did. If we had taken that deal, it would 
have been very unpleasant, very messy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I absolutely wanted 'The Tonight Show.' But I realized that I didn't get what 
I wanted, so I have to make the best of what I have. And it wasn't until maybe 
a week or two into (the new CBS show) that I realized that what I had maybe was 
the best thing after all for me. So it kind of dawned on me gradually." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What became clear during the protracted negotiations between NBC and Letterman 
from 1991 to 1993 was that the genial, Hollywood-based Leno had won the ear of 
management, particularly in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Letterman, New York-based, speaks warmly of his relationships with former NBC 
honchos Grant Tinker and Brandon Tartikoff: "These guys put me in business." 
But particularly after General Electric bought NBC in the mid-1980s, with 
Tinker gone and Tartikoff to follow later, it seemed that Letterman's 
relationships with management were not the same, and the stinging barbs he 
aimed at the network and GE were a little too realistic to be just fun and 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet here he was wanting "The Tonight Show" badly -- although he was tactfully 
restrained about it in public statements -- and at the same time he and the 
management that would decide his future appeared to be drifting apart publicly. 
How does he assess his difficult associations with the network's management 
during that critical period? 
</P>
<P>
 "I will take the responsibility for all of that," he says. "I think that we 
felt for a long, long time like we were laboring in kind of anonymity. And I 
allowed myself to generate some resentments -- most of them petty, by the way. 
And I think it was an area we just weren't actively nurturing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I would have to take responsibility for the deterioration of the 
relationship. At times we'd go years without trouble. The kind of thing that 
sort of upset me -- and I guess I overreacted to it -- was when they wanted to 
rent out our studio during the day to Maury Povich (in 1991). 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought: No, this isn't right. And it's not right because I'm Dave 
Letterman -- it's not right because that's not how you run a TV show. You don't 
slam another production in there and inconvenience everybody -- because TV, 
night in and night out, is a dogfight and you need every little advantage you 
can muster. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I felt like, 'This is an ideological disagreement. These people don't 
understand that it's not ego. It's not because I think I'm Mr. Big Shot. It's 
because it doesn't make any sense. It's a mistake.' And I believe that's when I 
sort of gradually got the feeling like my time there was limited, that I was 
ultimately expendable." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Letterman is definitely not expendable at CBS. In fact, his hourlong show gets 
prominent mention in the network's latest, upbeat earnings report, which shows 
a 39% increase in net income for the fourth quarter of 1993 compared to the 
previous year. Example: "The CBS Television Network is now heading toward an 
exceptional triple crown -- winning the ratings races in prime time, daytime 
and late-night television in the current season." 
</P>
<P>
 And this: "(CBS) Television Network revenue growth was aided by higher pricing 
during the prime evening hours and by the debut of 'Late Show With David 
Letterman.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors persist that CBS may merge with a studio -- perhaps Disney -- in the 
not-too-distant future and, if so, the Letterman show can only make the network 
more valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the success of his show is also a healthy boost for all of network 
TV because there now are three successful late-night series to shore up one of 
the few remaining strong areas of the Big Three broadcasters -- CBS, NBC and 
ABC. CBS has Letterman, NBC has Leno and ABC has Ted Koppel's "Nightline." 
</P>
<P>
 Letterman says he's surprised by the strength of the 11:30 competition: 
"Before we went on the air, I assumed that for us to succeed, we absolutely had 
to take away audience from 'The Tonight Show' and, moreover, pretty much put 
them out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt that you have 'Nightline,' you have 'The Tonight Show' and that's the 
limit of the audience. And while I think we have had an effect on the ratings 
of 'The Tonight Show,' it seems like we have generated or developed or brought 
in a brand-new group of people who are not directly affected by 'The Tonight 
Show' night in and night out. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning, it was also frightening because I thought that these people 
are tourists, they're not looking to buy into the neighborhood, they're just 
passing through. But so far we've been incredibly lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Letterman's value to top-ranked CBS -- where his ratings success is 
already paying off on his three-year, $42-million deal -- "his impact as a 
revenue generator is only going to grow in future negotiations (with 
sponsors)," says David Poltrack, the network's senior vice president of 
planning and research. 
</P>
<P>
 "His impact on our fourth-quarter earnings was reflected at a modest 
guaranteed rating. We sold this show at a 4.1 rating and it's getting a 5.6 
(each point represents 942,000 homes). In the next negotiation, we'll be 
selling it at a 5.6. There's always a one-season lag because you're always 
selling off speculation, which in this case was conservative. We didn't want to 
promise more than we could deliver." 
</P>
<P>
 Through their first 23 weeks of competition, Letterman, with his 5.6 ratings 
average, drew 18% of the available viewers. Leno, meanwhile, had a 4.4 rating 
and a 13% share. A year ago, says Poltrack, CBS, then showing action series in 
the time slot now occupied by Letterman, was averaging a 3.0 rating and 10 
share. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're up 87%, Leno is down 6% from a year ago," says Poltrack, adding that 
"Nightline" is "essentially unchanged." The CBS researcher says that, in 
replacing the old action series, Letterman has also lifted the network's 
tune-in by 118% with 18-to-49-year-old viewers and 144% with the 
25-to-54-year-old audience -- the categories most advertisers lust over. 
</P>
<P>
 The importance of CBS stations carrying the show in its regular network time 
slot -- rather than on a delayed basis -- was underscored by Poltrack. Citing 
key cities such as Washington, Dallas and Kansas City where ratings jumped 
significantly when they recently began carrying the series in its regular time 
period, he says: 
</P>
<P>
 "Affiliates are getting out of contracts and moving him into a live situation. 
We anticipate this will continue until he has virtually complete live clearance 
and that his advantage will thus grow. The track record of those stations that 
have converted is forming the major selling point to get the others to switch." 
</P>
<P>
 NBC Research counters that while he is behind, Leno has steadily "trended up" 
from his ratings six months ago in total homes, audience share and the key 
young-adult demographics. For example, in his first 12 weeks against Letterman, 
he averaged a 4 rating, but in the next 11 weeks he rose to a 4.6 -- a 15% 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
 For Letterman, being the solid leader at the moment is a bit mind-boggling: 
"With the disadvantage of the affiliate clearances . . . I thought if we could 
have been at least within striking distance of 'Nightline' or 'The Tonight 
Show,' then we could have thought, 'OK, we're trying, we're building.' But when 
we saw the ratings for the first night, a huge weight had been lifted." 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is down to the nitty-gritty. Letterman and Leno are doing well against 
each other in their home-base cities. So during the May ratings sweeps, they'll 
invade each other's territory for a week each -- Leno going to New York and 
Letterman coming to Los Angeles -- in hopes of gaining more viewers in a couple 
of their important weak spots, which happen to be the nation's two top TV 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles has not exactly gone overboard for Letterman despite his success 
elsewhere. CBS sources think it's partly because the network's local station, 
KCBS-TV, "is a weak performer," including its critical 11 p.m. news that is 
Letterman's lead-in. Poltrack thinks "community loyalty" for the hometown Leno 
show is another factor. Lassally agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're also coming (to Los Angeles)," says Letterman, "because we've 
established ourselves, we're doing very well and we want to come right into the 
heart of American television, which is obviously Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One day, after Leno had gotten the "Tonight Show" job, Letterman picked up a 
publication in New York and saw an advertisement touting the new heir to the 
late-night series, the man who would follow in the footsteps of Allen, Paar and 
Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It broke my heart," Letterman says. "I thought it would have been a real pat 
on the back, a real accomplishment, to have been in that picture." 
</P>
<P>
 Carson is a close personal friend, and Letterman's director, Hal Gurnee -- who 
has inventively incorporated the New York setting into the show -- once worked 
for Paar. There is little doubt that Letterman felt he was a natural part of 
"The Tonight Show" legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 He sought advice from some of those connected with the legacy, including 
Carson and Lassally, before finally saying goodby to NBC and accepting CBS' 
offer. In addition, says Letterman, he talked to Morton, Gurnee and Jude 
Brennan, one of his producers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Carson has done for me and means to me represents a great influence," 
Letterman says. "So after talking to all of those people -- and the opinions 
ranged from 'You're nuts if you stay' to 'You gotta get out' -- and then after 
I talked to Carson, I felt like I had now talked to the people who are the most 
important folks in my life. And I don't believe they would mislead me." 
</P>
<P>
 When Letterman left, it was yet a further breakup of a great, three-program, 
late-night NBC dynasty. At its height, it included Carson, Letterman and Bob 
Costas, who is also ending his wee-hours show on the network at the end of this 
week, although he is remaining at NBC. The new late-night NBC lineup is Leno, 
O'Brien and, beginning Feb. 28, Greg Kinnear, who has a program on the E! cable 
network. 
</P>
<P>
 Letterman, meanwhile, finally seems at peace with his decision. Beyond the 
ratings and the money, a sense of freedom permeates his enthusiasm: "We've been 
sort of giddy ever since we went on the air. We just couldn't believe that all 
of a sudden, people were looking at this little nickel-and-dime thing that 
we've been doing for years and were, by and large, pleased with it. It's the 
most rewarding thing I've ever encountered in my life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the underdog team that gets into the World Series and takes the 
first three games, and you think, 'Man, we've got a shot at this thing,' and 
then the rest of the Series they're playing over their head." 
</P>
<P>
 On Mom: 
</P>
<P>
 "CBS . . . said, 'You can do anything you want with the Olympics. You can send 
a crew over there, you can go there.' They gave us pretty much a blank check. 
We didn't know what to do. And then my mother's name came up. I think we were 
sort of out of ideas. When you're out of ideas, you go to your mom.' 
</P>
<P>
 On middle age: 
</P>
<P>
 "No one is more aware on a minute-by-minute basis that I will be 50 in four 
years. I have a quiet little goal . . . which is: Let's take a look at this 
when you're 50 and see if the thing is still viable. I don't believe we are the 
avant-garde. I wish I could say we're leading the way and know exactly what 
we're doing. The truth of it is we're hanging on, we're chasing a truck, we're 
doing the best we can.' 
</P>
<P>
 Dave, Jay and Arsenio have declared a truce in the late-night booking wars.

COMMENTARY; WHAT MAKES DAVE SO WATCHABLE? LET US COUNT THE WAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, Howard Rosenberg is The Times' television critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Call it bad timing or bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
 But how ironic that "The Tonight Show" has strong ratings, that its writing is 
consistently sharp, that host Jay Leno is funnier and his hour of late-night 
comedy more creative and less predictable than ever. In other circumstances, 
everyone would be buzzing about him. 
</P>
<P>
 Competing with his nemesis, David Letterman, seems to have made Leno better. 
Always supremely adept at telling jokes while standing on a stage, Leno is now 
tapping areas of comedy that may be surprising even him. Bravo. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet just as Gehrig had Ruth and Pippen had Jordan, NBC's Leno and "The Tonight 
Show" seem destined to be overshadowed, at least for now, by "Late Show With 
David Letterman" on CBS. Even when Leno soars, Letterman usually dunks right 
over him. 
</P>
<P>
 Leno obviously has lots of fans who prefer him to Letterman, but the pro-Dave 
army is larger, according to the Nielsens, and with good reason. No wonder more 
and more of the early-to-bed crowd are staying up to tune in at least part of 
"Late Show." When you hear that intro after half an hour of idiotic local news 
-- "Here he is, Da- vid Letterman" -- your expectations rise dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is Letterman's show so funny? 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough for a talk show, it appears to have little to do with the guests. 
In fact, it's hard to recall many of them, to say nothing of what they've said 
or done in the host's presence. What you do recall is the hour's edge, its 
sense of danger (even though it takes fewer risks than his scruffier old NBC 
show did) and its magnificent absurdity. It's the kind of practiced absurdity 
that Letterman has elevated to glossy art and that Leno has yet to master. 
</P>
<P>
 The highlight of last Monday night's show, for example, was not a 12-year-old 
duck caller or Letterman's mother stiffly checking in by satellite from the 
Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, a pretty fair farce of its own. It was 
Letterman giving an award to Charles Grodin for . . . for . . . for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, Grodin was overcome with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 With the pomp of an Oscar presenter, Letterman opened a fancy envelope and 
called out the name of the surprised but euphoric Grodin, who had been seated 
in the audience. He bolted from his seat and rushed down the aisle toward 
Letterman, whom he thanked profusely before departing. Given that Grodin had 
worked so hard and long for this recognition, the honor was something to savor. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut to Regis Philbin in the audience, baffled and dejected, obviously 
disappointed that he hadn't won. Well, perhaps next year. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a tiny blip of comedy, but one that acutely captured the essence of 
Letterman and set him apart from his late-night competitor on NBC -- a 
brilliantly, hilariously written and executed spec of nonsense that affirmed 
"Late Show With David Letterman" as TV's funniest show about nothing.

FILM CLIPS: A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: THE ACTING BUG BITES ETHAN 
HAWKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE DUTKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Reality Bites," a new film about a quartet of twentysome-things coping with 
life and love, was a marked departure from his previous cinematic outings, says 
its star Ethan Hawke, who at 23 is emerging as one of Hollywood's hottest young 
talents. 
</P>
<P>
 With virtually the entire cast, a first-time feature film director and a 
first-time screenwriter all under the age of 30, the movie not only deals with 
Generation X but was created by it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was sort of a 'Hey, kids, let's put on a play,' " recalls Hawke, who vies 
for the affections of Winona Ryder in the film. "(Director-actor) Ben Stiller 
worked hard to create a stimulating environment for us. He didn't want to be 
usurped by (the distributor) Universal Pictures. We knew the studio wanted the 
movie to be good and original but had little idea of how to get us there." 
</P>
<P>
 The title of the romantic comedy, which opened in Los Angeles on Friday, is a 
double-entendre: "Bites" as in "sound bites" of the reality captured by Ryder 
on a video she hopes will propel here into the big time. And "bites" as in 
"stinks." Though this generation has rejected the idealism of their 
countercultural parents, the film suggests, it has found little of meaning to 
put in its place. 
</P>
<P>
 Preparing for the role of Troy -- an ironic poet/musician who bucks compromise 
and commitment -- required little preparation on the part of Hawke. He 
performed at an L.A. club in anticipation of his first singing scene. For the 
most part, howev er, the character just kicked in. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Troy, Hawke grew up in Texas, the product of a broken home. Unlike the 
character, however, he knew where he was going. Acting was a refuge for this 
self-described "terrible student," a way to get out in the world for a kid who 
couldn't wait for life to start. Hawke's family eventually moved to Princeton, 
N.J., where, as a 13-year-old, he made his stage debut in the McCarter 
Theater's production of "St. Joan." A casting director who caught the show had 
him audition for Joe Dante's sci-fi fantasy "Explorers." Young Ethan got the 
part, but the film was a flop. "I dreamed they did a remake without me," he 
says. "On some level, I blamed myself." 
</P>
<P>
 After graduation, Hawke enrolled in Pittsburgh's Carnegie-Mellon University. 
When the role of the tongue-tied writer in "Dead Poets Society" came along a 
few months later, however, he threw academics to the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 No regrets, he maintains. " 'Dead Poets' made me an actor," he says on the 
phone from his New York apartment. "(Director) Peter Weir is very passionate 
about what he does and gave me the feeling that this is not a business but a 
creative place to be. I soon learned that all movies aren't like that -- but 
it's nice to know it's a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 The outgoing Hawke lost out on a flashier role, ultimately played by Robert 
Sean Leonard, when Weir cast against type. The actor emerged from the critical 
and box-office success with a measure of recognition, nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 Fame, Hawke acknowledges is a complicated animal. He's grateful, in 
retrospect, that his career took off incrementally -- "unlike a Johnny Depp, 
who went from out-of-work actor to wildly famous months after '21 Jump Street' 
hit the air." Still, part of him was drawn to the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 "For awhile, I was a little jealous of (the late) River Phoenix," he says of 
the actor he appeared with in "Explorers." "A part of me finds fame appealing. 
I just hope I can handle it as well as Peter Weir. Success just made him more 
confident instead of an asshole." 
</P>
<P>
 Acting, Hawke has learned, is a profession of compromise. The fact hit home 
during the physically arduous shoots of "Alive" -- based on the true story of a 
soccer team resorting to cannibalism after its plane crashed in the Andes -- 
and the Alaskan adventure "White Fang," in which he played the lead at the age 
of 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're on top of a mountain and have time for only two takes before the 
sun goes down, a lot of priority isn't placed on acting," he says. "You aspire 
to perfection, but it gets down to 'What do you have . . . and can you give it 
to me right now?' No one makes it easy. And there are no subtitles onscreen 
explaining that you did a damn fine job, considering that you'd been shooting 
all night or had only 15 minutes to prepare." 
</P>
<P>
 In film, some of an actor's best moments can end up on the cutting-room floor, 
Hawke observes. Likewise, cinematic magic can be created out of a lackluster 
performance. Theater, in contrast, is an actor's and writer's medium -- one 
which gives him particular satisfaction. This year, he and playwright Jonathan 
Marc Sherman rented space on Manhattan's Theater Row, where they put together a 
three-play repertory season, a coffeehouse and a literary journal. Next fall, 
he hopes, will hold more of the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawke's last few pictures took him away from the innocent, idealistic youths 
he'd been playing in films such as the World War II drama "A Midnight Clear." 
But, he suggests, it's anyone's guess what's ahead. Though his preference has 
always been drama over comedy, substantive projects are hard to get off the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "The better the script, the harder it is -- particularly if the lead is 
unlikable," he says. "And, yet, an 'Ace Ventura, Pet Detective' not only gets 
financed but turns out to be one of the most popular films in the country. I 
can't figure it -- which is probably why they'll never make me a studio chief." 
</P>
<P>
 What about "director"? He's already directed onstage and his short feature 
"Straight to One" screened at the Sundance Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to be the best actor I can be," says Hawke, before cutting 
himself off. "Hell," he comments in apparent disgust, "I sound like a 
(expletive) Army ad."*

LOOK WHO WE FOUND; MARIA SCHNEIDER'S STILL IN PARIS, BUT SHE DOESN'T TANGO 
ANYMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, Scott Kraft is The Times' Paris bureau chief. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maria Schneider was just 19 years old when she did the last tango and some 
rather more risque dances here with a middle-aged widower played by Marlon 
Brando. "Last Tango in Paris" became an X-rated movie classic in 1972, but the 
uninhibited young French star seemed to disappear as quickly as she was 
discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happened to Maria Schneider? The actress, now 41, pondered that 
question in the bar of the Ritz Hotel the other day, pausing to light a 
cigarette and sip her espresso. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you start your career like I did, with a film like 'Last Tango,' it's a 
little hard," she began, speaking in a soft, deep voice. "It's better to grow 
in a career steadily." 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider has made only one other appearance on the American big screen, in 
"The Passenger," a 1975 film starring Jack Nicholson. Since then, she has done 
20 films, all in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been working, but my only regret is that I haven't worked in the States 
since then," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Next month, she will be seen in a supporting role in Gramercy Pictures' 
"Savage Nights," a powerful French autobiographical film by Cyril Collard, who 
died of AIDS last March. Schneider plays a Moroccan psychic who appears to the 
HIV-infected man in a dream. She describes it as a "very small, very strong 
part."  
</P>
<P>
 The film was hailed by critics in France as a courageously honest portrait of 
a bisexual, 30-year-old man with AIDS who is torn between his love for a woman, 
18-year-old Laura, and a man, 20-year-old Samy. French audiences were 
fascinated by Collard's willingness to portray himself as an egocentric 
character who slept with a young woman several times before telling her he 
carried the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was touched by his true story," Schneider said. "It's quite admirable to be 
so honest. But I was quite depressed after seeing it. I guess I live in this 
very romantic world. I had no idea people could live like he did." 
</P>
<P>
 She considers Collard's film "a very interesting first effort," but she 
doesn't think it's a "masterwork. It would have been interesting to see what he 
would have done after that." 
</P>
<P>
 Since "Last Tango" and "The Passenger," Schneider's European roles have 
included a baby-sitter who kidnaps the children, a criminal who does 10 years 
in jail for killing her husband and, in her most recent film, "Sandscreen," a 
Saudi Arabian princess. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing jeans, a wool jacket and leather boots during a recent interview, she 
appeared thinner and more handsomely mature than the teen-ager who wowed 
American audiences as Brando's innocent femme fatale . She is bemused that 
anyone would still be interested in "Last Tango" and Jeanne, a role she was 
chosen for from hundreds of actresses in Paris, and for which she was paid just 
$5,000. To her, the film seems ages old. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you remember everything you did 20 years ago?" she asked. "And when I see 
'Last Tango' today, I have to say it got old. The film has aged." 
</P>
<P>
 But, when pressed, she admits that her American experience was enriching for a 
young actress. And she still recalls how Brando asked her what her astrological 
sign is on the first day of shooting, and seemed relieved upon learning it was 
the same as his -- Aries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm quite proud to be the only European actress to play opposite Marlon 
Brando. Quite proud," she said. "And then to play with Jack Nicholson, too. 
They're not weak actors, you know. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I was young in those days," she added. "I play mothers now." 
</P>
<P>
 She says she doesn't much miss the fame, fleeting though it was. "I did this 
one film and suddenly I couldn't travel without people recognizing me," she 
said. "It was insane. People saw me on the street and starting thinking I was 
like Jeanne in real life." 
</P>
<P>
 She spent two years in Los Angeles in the early '70s, but, homesick, returned 
to Paris. The daughter of a French actor, Schneider has never married and she 
leads a rather quiet life here.  
</P>
<P>
 She's an admirer of American films. "We still make some good films in Europe, 
but the women's parts in American films are much more interesting. We don't 
build many films on women stars. Here you play the wife or the mistress." 
</P>
<P>
 But she harbors little desire to return to Hollywood. Her heavily accented 
English is a drawback. And, as she has matured, her Romanian-Greek roots 
combined with her curly black hair have produced a look that is difficult to 
cast as French. "It's hard for me to find parts in America," she said. "I could 
play a Mexican maybe or a Colombian. Look, I'm objective about it." 
</P>
<P>
 She's not sure how Collard's tale of love and AIDS will play in America. "The 
attraction of romance is very French," she said. "But in the States, you aren't 
that romantic. It'll be interesting to see what happens."*

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: DIRECT APPROACH; 'EXIT TO 
EDEN' GIVES WRITER HER 'LAST SHOT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY BRENNAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While adapting Anne Rice's erotic fantasy novel "Exit to Eden" for the big 
screen, writer Deborah Amelon got to realize one of her own fantasies -- minus 
the sex. 
</P>
<P>
 While weaving together the "Eden" script for director and co-producer Garry 
Marshall ("Pretty Women"), she directed him as the lead actor in her own 
project, a short called "The Last Shot." It is a directorial debut for Amelon, 
who has spent the bulk of her career writing TV miniseries and movies of the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Last Shot" is about the dying patriarch of a family who has instructed 
his doctor and son to give him his last shot of medication since he's lost his 
will to live. In the process, he changes his mind. The short, which will air 
again on Showtime in March (it previously ran in September and October), is 
part of the cable channel's Chanticleer for aspiring directors. Amelon is 
hoping her piece will also get a theatrical showing in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my meetings on 'Exit to Eden,' I'd look at Garry and think, he's really 
the dad in my movie. It was scarier asking him to do it than directing him when 
he accepted. He said, 'I'm really not doing this as a favor. I really want to 
do the part.' He wasn't any trouble. He'd change a word or two here and there, 
but really followed the script," recalls Amelon. "There was one speech he 
didn't really want to do and I had to make him do it. It was really interesting 
to be put in that position . . . the student directing the teacher, telling the 
teacher what he had to do. I was very . . . nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Marshall: "She treated me the way that I would treat an actor -- firm, 
yet with enough finesse and sensitivity to make it a dignified experience. You 
must remember, I was in my pajamas for the entire movie, which is not exactly a 
major clout outfit!" 
</P>
<P>
 Production sources say Marshall may have a cameo bit in "Eden" as well, but 
Marshall, Amelon and producer Alexandra Rose refuse to discuss any details 
about the film, insisting it's premature. Marshall has played bit parts in a 
number of movies over the years, including "Lost in America," "Soapdish" and 
his director-sister Penny Marshall's "Jumpin' Jack Flash" and "A League of 
Their Own."  
</P>
<P>
 "Eden," which stars Paul Mercurio ("Strictly Ballroom") and Dana Delany 
("Tombstone," ABC's "China Beach"), is set for a July 22 release by Savoy 
Pictures. Essentially, the story is about a sex camp for adults. While Amelon 
and Rose won't talk about the screen adaptation, Rice's novel centers on an 
adventurous photojournalist (Mercurio) who sells himself into sexual slavery 
for a huge sum of money to spend two years on Eden, a sadomasochism island in 
the sun. Problems arise when he falls for the camp's headmistress (Delany).*

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: SEAGAL UNDER SIEGE; TOO 
DEADLY FOR CRITICS TO PREVIEW? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY BRENNAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steven Seagal's directorial debut, "On Deadly Ground," is teetering on a 
cliff's edge performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently Warner Bros., which is distributing the eco-thriller, nixed any 
pre-release press screenings before Thursday's celebrity premiere and the 
film's opening on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The official line from the studio is that last month's Northridge earthquake 
caused damage to its post-production facility and to the film's negative, 
housed in that building. It suffered water damage as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 But inside sources say that's only partially true and that the picture suffers 
from the box-office star's neophyte role as a director. They say Warner Bros. 
didn't want film critics to take early jabs at the movie, something studio 
officials flatly deny. Still, insiders and the studio expect "Deadly" will have 
a fairly strong opening based on Seagal's huge fan following and prior 
box-office prowess: 
</P>
<P>
 His scorecard to date: 1988's "Above the Law," $18.9 million; 1990's "Hard to 
Kill," $47.4 million; 1990's "Marked for Death," $46 million; 1991's "Out for 
Justice," $39.7 million, and his biggest, 1992's "Under Siege," $83.6 million. 
It was that film that gave Seagal the muscle to persuade the studio to let him 
direct a picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics at the studio snickered at Seagal's 10-minute diatribe at the end 
of the movie about saving the environment. The length of that soliloquy was 
clipped quite a bit, according to Warner insiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say Warners was also worried about the competition this weekend, when 
"Deadly" was to open against Paramount's basketball movie "Blue Chips," which 
stars Nick Nolte and was directed by William Friedkin.*

 Screenwriter Jeb Stuart and screen star Harrison Ford seem to be suffering 
from bouts of sequelitis. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart, who co-wrote the box-office blockbuster and Oscar nominee "The 
Fugitive," has been tapped to write "Fugitive 2." 
</P>
<P>
 Missing from the screenplay credits will be the prequel's co-author: David 
Twohy. While the film's producer Arnold Kopelson and financier/distributor 
Warner Bros. are mum on details of what the sequel's storyline will be, sources 
close to the project say several possibilities are floating around. Stuart is 
holed up in his Connecticut home, typing away on the third "Indiana Jones" 
sequel for Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, and isn't taking phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 One possibility has the one-armed man, Sykes (Andreas Katsulas), and his 
colleague in crime, Dr. Charles Nichols (Jeroen Krabbe), getting out of jail to 
taunt Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) once more. Kopelson's camp is 
reportedly hoping to persuade Ford and Tommy Lee Jones (who is nominated for a 
best supporting actor Academy Award as U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard) into 
reteaming for the sequel. 
</P>
<P>
 Those close to Ford who were involved in the movie remake of the popular TV 
series say that the actor originally balked at the notion of appearing in 
another sequel. He's currently in Mexico filming "Clear and Present Danger" -- 
based on the Tom Clancy novel and sequel to the author's "Patriot Games," which 
also starred Ford. He's also expected to star in the "Indiana Jones" sequel 
sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the third act (of filming "The Fugitive") someone said a scene was 
being cut so it could be used for a sequel, when Harrison snapped and said he 
wasn't doing a (expletive) sequel," said one source. He wasn't going to commit 
to a sequel if the film flopped, according to a source close to Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that the picture has grossed $190 million domestically (and an extra 
$176.1 million worldwide) and is an Oscar contender, Ford has changed his tune 
a bit. He's adopting a wait-and-consider attitude until seeing Stuart's script. 
Delivery is expected in June.

'LOCO' HOPES TO HIT GRAND SLAM FOR LATINOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coming in June, in the raunchy, X-rated tradition of "Russell Simmons' Def 
Comedy Jam," is more ethnic humor with some real spice. 
</P>
<P>
 The producers of HBO's "Loco Slam," the Latino version of the African American 
comedy show, are crossing their fingers that the show will be as big a boost 
for Latino comics as "Def Comedy Jam" has been for black comedians. 
</P>
<P>
 Comedian Paul Rodriguez, one of "Loco Slam's" executive producers, said he 
shopped the idea around to various cable outlets for 3 1/2 years before he 
could persuade HBO to take a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw how I could draw crowds in cities where there were hardly any Latinos," 
he said. "I just kept telling them it was like 'Field of Dreams' -- if you 
build it, they will come. The success of 'Def Jam' was very much responsible 
for us finally getting this through." 
</P>
<P>
 The format of "Loco Slam" is almost identical to that of "Def Comedy Jam." 
Host Carlos Mencia makes jokes and pokes fun at audience members while trying 
to keep the energy of the club pumped up. A deejay scratches disco and Latin 
tunes while a woman plays congas. 
</P>
<P>
 Four installments of the show, which will air in June, were taped earlier this 
month at the Mayan Theatre in downtown Los Angeles with comics from around the 
country. The raunch level of Mencia and the other comedians matched that of 
"Def Comedy Jam" host Martin Lawrence and any "Def Jam" performer: Routines 
were filled with references to oral sex, John Wayne Bobbitt and orgasms. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the coarsest comics -- and also the one to make the biggest splash with 
the audience during one of the tapings -- was Chris (Crazy Legs) Fonseca, who 
has cerebral palsy. Fonseca scored points with a routine that made a rather 
far-fetched connection between sex and a bag of Chee-tos. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't born handicapped," Fonseca said as he moved around in a chair. "I 
was once an Olympic figure skating champion. That (expletive) Tonya Harding!" 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Nely Galan, another executive producer of "Loco Slam," said the show is part 
of the programming slate of HBO Tropix, a division of the network that is 
involved in developing business opportunities in the English- and 
Spanish-speaking Latino markets in the United States and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to get Latinos into the system, to let the children of the immigrants 
see ourselves as we are," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mencia: "This show will cater to a certain audience, but in the end I 
hope it appeals to everyone. There's a lot we all have in common, and I hope 
someday we won't have to have shows like this that separate one culture from 
another." GREG BRAXTON

TRUCE DECLARED IN LATE-NIGHT BOOKING WARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE, Daniel Cerone is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A week ago Friday, Steven Seagal made his first appearance on David 
Letterman's "Late Show" to hype his new action film, "On Deadly Ground." Last 
Tuesday, Seagal visited the syndicated late-night talk show of his friend, 
Arsenio Hall, for the same reason. Two nights later, Seagal could be seen 
chatting up his movie with Jay Leno on "The Tonight Show." 
</P>
<P>
 So, whatever happened to those late-night Booking Wars? 
</P>
<P>
 Like most great battles, the often fierce behind-the-scenes struggles among 
late-night TV producers to secure exclusive bookings for top stars has run its 
course. There's a late-night armistice in effect, and guests are now roaming 
freely between Letterman, Leno and Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a new age here," said Paul Bloch of Rogers & Cowan, who worked on 
the publicity campaign for "On Deadly Ground." "Everybody understands that you 
can do two or three of the shows and, provided the actor wants to do them, it 
doesn't hurt anybody. It certainly helps us." 
</P>
<P>
 Not as clear, however, is which show is the favorite among Hollywood 
celebrities and the publicists who arrange their appearances. Ratings, 
demographics, physical proximity and personal preference all are factors that 
get weighed in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 After six months of ratings preeminence at 11:35 p.m. on CBS, Letterman is 
landing high-profile guests who never appeared on the host's more caustic 12:35 
a.m. NBC program, such as Seagal, Sean Connery, Rosie O'Donnell, Jeremy Irons 
and Sally Fields. And he gets some of them to engage in daring stunts and 
gimmicks. Alec Baldwin was recently seen driving a snowmobile on the roof of a 
nearby parking garage, and Connery flew in on a jet pack in October to disprove 
worldwide reports that he was terminally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 But Letterman does not get all the best bookings, by a long shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "The show that everyone looks up to creatively and wants to be on is 
Letterman's show," said the head of one major talent agency. "The show that 
you're on because you're on the West Coast and it does a rating and you want to 
promote something is Leno's show." 
</P>
<P>
 Letterman tapes "Late Show" on Broadway in New York, while Leno tapes "The 
Tonight Show" in Burbank. There's little doubt that location plays a key 
element in booking both shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's purely geographic," said Pat Kingsley, president of the public-relations 
firm PMK. For example, she placed Tom Hanks on Letterman in December when he 
was doing an Eastern publicity tour for the film "Philadelphia," while Roseanne 
Arnold will do Leno this week because she's still shooting the ABC sitcom 
"Roseanne" in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "If clients are back east, it's an automatic opportunity to do Letterman. Out 
here, it's easier to try to put them on Leno," Kingsley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the case of Tim Allen, who has done both shows, and of course can do both 
shows, the location in New York just becomes a headache," offered Allen's 
manager, Rick Messina. Allen did "The Tonight Show" last week to promote his 
ABC sitcom "Home Improvement," TV's top-rated program, for the February ratings 
sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
 "As it is, when Tim does 'The Tonight Show,' he runs over during a lunch break 
at Disney (in Burbank), does it really quick and then runs back," Messina said. 
"So the convenience is much better for a West Coast-based artist with a 
business schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Publicity strategists also look at the different audiences they want to reach. 
Letterman is hot right now, with a heavy concentration of educated young adults 
watching. Leno has maintained his broader, older audience. And Hall, whose 
ratings are much lower than those of the other two, scores with young urban 
viewers, especially women. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you basically try to do is cover all demographics," said Marleah Leslie, 
who handles publicity for a stable of comedians. "The strategy is you want to 
look at the demographic of the movie, and you want to figure out which talk 
show is geared toward the audience of that movie." 
</P>
<P>
 When Leslie booked Jim Carrey, whose film "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" was the 
surprise winner at the box office the past two weekends, she believed she could 
hit a wide enough audience by just scheduling him with Leno and Hall, who tapes 
his show in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Familiarity with the host can make a difference too. For Robert De Niro's 
directorial debut with "A Bronx Tale," the publicity-shy actor turned down 
Letterman, according to "Late Show" executive producer Robert Morton, but 
agreed to do "The Tonight Show" and Fox's failed "Chevy Chase Show." De Niro 
reportedly appeared on Chase's show as a favor to his friend Chase. 
</P>
<P>
 De Niro's publicist, Stan Rosenfield, would only say: "Certain artists have 
personal relationships with the host of a show that they just happen to work 
better with." 
</P>
<P>
 The relaxed attitude on all the talk shows is a breath of fresh air to 
managers, agents and publicists. When Leno took over for longtime "Tonight 
Show" host Johnny Carson in 1992, late-night TV became a hotbed of news with 
reports of high-pressure booking tactics, which resulted in NBC firing "Tonight 
Show" executive producer Helen Kushnick. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the problems that came about after the so-called Booking Wars, we 
realized we had to be more lenient," explained NBC spokeswoman Jennifer 
Barnett. "We like to have first shot at the best guests, but we don't worry 
about it if we don't get them first. If Dave has them first, we're still 
willing to have them." 
</P>
<P>
 Although "The Tonight Show" has relinquished its late-night ratings crown to 
"Late Show," Leno has managed to retain roughly the same size audience he had 
before Letterman moved opposite him. According to CBS and NBC research, viewers 
are tuning in to see their favorite host, not their favorite guest. So 
featuring a big guest first amounts to little more than bragging rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is, by the mere power of our audience, I like to have the guest on 
first," said "Late Show's" Morton. But he was trying hard at press time last 
week to get Kim Basinger to appear with Letterman a week after she was on with 
Leno. "If a guest does 'The Tonight Show' first, it's not the end of the 
world," Morton said.*

'EDU-TAINMENT' FINDS CREATIVE OUTLET IN NEW PACIFIC NORTHWEST MUSEUM; NATURAL 
HISTORY: CURATORS SHUN 'OLD BONES AND DINOSAURS,' ENVISION PUTTING FUN INTO 
EXHIBITS, CREATING SIGHTS AND SOUNDS AND SMELLS LIKE A DISNEY ATTRACTION.

<P>
 When people walk into the new Pacific Northwest Museum of Natural History this 
summer, they'll enter through a lava tube complete with flowing magma, hear the 
cries of wild animals and tap into computer databases. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't your old bones and dinosaurs museum," said development director 
Jerry Price. "This is absolutely the museum of the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Lamb, executive director of the museum, calls it edu-tainment, an 
entertaining approach to education. It's the same notion that prompted him to 
bring pizzas for students when he taught the ins and outs of the digestive 
tract in biology courses at Southern Oregon State College, which owns the land 
where the museum is built. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got to be made more hands-on and user-friendly or people won't come 
to them," Lamb said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new generation of museums form a perimeter around Oregon, catching 
tourists from all directions. 
</P>
<P>
 To the north is the new Oregon Museum of Science and Industry in Portland. To 
the east, there's the Oregon Trail Interpretive Center in Baker City. The 
$10-million Pacific Northwest Natural History Museum opens July 1 to grab 
people driving up from California. And the Oregon Coast Aquarium in Newport has 
staked out the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it opened May 23, 1992, the aquarium has shattered attendance 
expectations, drawing 1.5 million visitors, and has been credited with boosting 
bookings at local motels, reflected in an 18% jump in room-tax receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're sick of the gift shops and just spending money," said Craig Thomas, 
economic development director for the Greater Newport Chamber of Commerce. "If 
they're going to come to the coast, they want to learn about the fishing and 
different creatures." 
</P>
<P>
 Museums are starting to have something in common with Nevada casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Academy Studio of Novato, Calif., which is building the exhibits at the 
Pacific Northwest Museum of Natural History, also is doing research and 
development on a project for the Reno Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
 "They actually want to reconstruct a Northwest forest -- right down the center 
of the casino, a Northwest forest -- with a huge waterfall, a big 
special-effects sky with projected images, lightning bolts that split trees, 
and about 50 robotic pieces that go into that," said Dean Weldon, president of 
Academy Studio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Museums are being affected by entertainment and attractions, and, inversely, 
attractions are being influenced by museums." 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are the stuffed animals and the painted backdrop behind a big picture 
window that once were the standard of natural history museums, most of which 
were built in big cities before the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ashland exhibit is kind of like an educational attraction," Weldon said. 
"One thing that has happened is that society has de-emphasized schools. So 
cultural centers are much more important to the ongoing education of society." 
</P>
<P>
 Driven by Lamb's vision of environmental education, the $10-million museum is 
being built through a combination of public and private grants, including $2.7 
million from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which operates a wildlife 
forensics laboratory next door. 
</P>
<P>
 The main attraction will be the ecosystems of the Northwest. These will 
feature the smell of seaweed at the coast, the moss on the floor of an 
old-growth forest and castings from real volcanic formations to convey the 
texture of the high desert's rimrock. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout, the displays will illuminate six principles of ecology: ecosystems 
change through time, energy flows through ecosystems, nutrients are recycled, 
species are interdependent, organisms are uniquely adapted and biodiversity 
creates strength. 
</P>
<P>
 As government support for museums has fallen, they find themselves having to 
survive in a competitive world, which means making themselves more attractive 
and fulfilling a number of roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides teaching about the environment, this museum acts as a launching pad 
for tourists by giving them a "passport" to real-life places around Oregon that 
correspond to the exhibits they find interesting in the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "The survival of museums depends on trying to find ways of bringing visitors 
back," said Craig Kerger, president of Formations Inc., a museum design firm in 
Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the computer stations where visitors ask and answer questions 
adjust to different levels of knowledge and avenues of interest, making each 
visit different. Camps, educational programs and visiting exhibits are planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The permanent exhibits were designed to get away from the traditional linear 
approach to learning and to adopt something more spatial, Kerger said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're working on creating exhibits that almost act like opera sets," he said. 
"You really have a few moments within a large space where you need to create a 
mood, a feeling, an environment that sets the stage for the information you are 
going to portray." 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing on techniques developed for special effects in the movies, exhibit 
builders can create some stunning displays, Weldon said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lava tube entrance, there will be a fissure where people feel a blast 
of hot air and see either a video display or some kind of actual glowing sludge 
to represent the flowing magma that created the lava tube. 
</P>
<P>
 Weldon also hopes to install robotic bats and butterflies at the lava tube 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you go into the lava cave, I think there should be some things twitching 
and moving," he said.

BLACK MOTHER OF 5 FINDS HOME -- AND A HUG; TEXAS: SO FAR, FIVE MINORITY 
FAMILIES HAVE MOVED INTO PREVIOUSLY ALL-WHITE HOUSING COMPLEX. OFFICIALS ARE 
HOLDING UNITS OPEN FOR 10 MORE.

 Hugs were the last thing Donise Jackson expected when she and her five 
children moved in the middle of the night under federal guard into this town's 
all-white public housing complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Death threats, taunts and slurs, perhaps. But not hugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really surprised me because I wasn't looking for it and I don't have to 
say a word," said Jackson, 25, raising her voice to be heard over her 
children's playful laughter in their freshly painted new apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just come up to me and ask me, 'Are you one of the ladies who moved out 
here?' and I tell them yeah, and they just, you know, some of them hug me. Some 
of them shake my hand and greet me. It's really not something I thought would 
take place." 
</P>
<P>
 Not many did. 
</P>
<P>
 Not after last year's disastrous desegregation effort by the Orange County 
Housing Authority, when the complex's four black families were chased away by 
death threats and taunts. The last to leave, Bill Simpson, was killed less than 
12 hours later in a random shooting in nearby Beaumont. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Henry Cisneros, 
seized control of the authority, demanded the resignation of its director and 
vowed that blacks would live in Vidor, about 100 miles east of Houston near the 
Texas-Louisiana border. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros also ordered $2.1 million in improvements, including a new laundry 
facility, air-conditioning units, job training, GED classes and shuttle van 
transportation for residents. 
</P>
<P>
 And he beefed up security. The circling development of single-story duplexes 
sits behind a six-foot chain-link fence and 24-hour police guard shack. 
Outsiders are barred unless invited by a resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal marshals accompany the complex's black residents to school, the store, 
visits to relatives in nearby towns, everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, five black families have moved into the 74-unit complex. Federal 
officials are holding apartments open for 10 more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made up my mind from the beginning (that) I was coming, regardless of what 
had happened, because somebody just has to," said Jackson, 25, who moved from 
Port Arthur about 20 miles away. "You just got to fight for what's right. If 
somebody comes in here and harms one of us, somebody is going to have to answer 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacists have held rallies in Vidor 
against integration. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Jacksons have settled comfortably into their four-bedroom dwelling, 
highlighted by the collage of family snapshots carefully arranged on the living 
room wall. Jackson said her three school-age children have yet to report 
incidents of racial bias at their previously all-white school. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the problems in Vidor, Jackson said, it's better than Port Arthur, 
where she and her children lived under the stench of oil refinery emissions in 
one of the town's poorest sections. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like this is the best place for me and my children," she said, 
pointing to the front yard and nearby play areas. "I don't care who likes it 
and who don't like it. Because I'm not going nowhere. I'm staying right here. I 
want the same things for my children that the people out here want for their 
children: to grow up in a decent place and have good schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County is one of 70 public housing authorities in 36 East Texas 
counties targeted by a 1980 class-action discrimination lawsuit. In 1983, a 
federal judge in Tyler ordered the desegregation effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who during her childhood was shuttled from relatives to foster homes, 
says she doesn't intend to spend her whole life in Vidor. She plans to take 
advantage of the GED classes and job training programs. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . I want to be able to work," she said. "I don't want my daughters to 
grow up and see me stay on welfare for the rest of my life getting food 
stamps."

ENVISIONING THE FUTURE OF BOLSA CHICA WETLANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In this new age of conservation, it is exciting to see developers opting to 
preserve natural habitats such as the Bolsa Chica wetlands. Why are people, 
including the County of Orange with its alternative plan, trying to impede Koll 
Real Estate Group's efforts to restore and protect our wetlands? 
</P>
<P>
 I would not classify myself as a hard-core environmentalist, but I do know a 
good deal when I see one. The landowner is offering full funding to restore the 
wetlands, provide diversified housing and create much needed jobs and revenue 
for our community. 
</P>
<P>
 We should take advantage of the opportunity in front of us. We can't continue 
to pound the Bolsa Chica plan into a meaningless vision of what we would like 
to see but that can never be accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 We should not allow ourselves to slip into a time where the needs of the 
environment are put on the back burner, while politics and ignorance create 
constant gridlock and no progress is made.

 * Regarding the story "Bone Sites Verified at Bolsa Chica (Feb. 15)," the Koll 
Co. and Lucy Dunn, their senior vice president, is saying so many things about 
the bones on the Bolsa Chica that I think she needs help keeping her stories 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
 In regards to whether human remains have been found on the Bolsa Chica, Koll 
said in an official report to the county that there have been no human bones 
found. At the Jan. 31 town hall meeting, Dunn stated, before an audience of 600 
citizens, that the bone fragments in question were only the size of a quarter. 
Today she is quoted as saying, "There is no question that the site is of great 
importance to the ancient history of Orange County," after a map has come to 
light that proves, according to The Times, that there are "at least 20 sites 
where bone matter has been found." 
</P>
<P>
 Koll says the proposed development will bring many jobs to the area in the 
future. The Koll Co. can help the unemployment situation right now by hiring 
someone who can either tell the truth about what is actually happening on the 
Bolsa Chica or at the very least keep spinning the stories in a more believable 
manner.

 * Commentaries on the Bolsa Chica project by Councilman Dave Sullivan and Lucy 
Dunn, Koll Real Estate Group senior vice president, were presented Feb. 13.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Sullivan addressed some issues of great concern to the community of 
Huntington Beach and our organization, the Amigos de Bolsa Chica. He was 
concerned that Koll could go forward with mesa development without any wetlands 
restoration. However, the Bolsa Chica Coalition Concept Plan that both he and 
Ms. Dunn refer to specifically deals with this. Essentially, the plan provides 
that for any development to take place on the mesa, it must first provide for 
wetlands restoration -- with funding mechanisms in place ahead of development. 
</P>
<P>
 The Amigos share his concern about impacts the proposed project would have on 
the community, both financially and environmentally. We continue to meet with 
the Koll Co., addressing our concerns about both the lead agency and density 
issues.  
</P>
<P>
 It's imperative that community participation be optimized throughout the 
process of determining what happens with the Bolsa Chica area. We heartily 
endorse Sullivan's call for a conscientious effort by the county to thoroughly 
address these impacts. We call on the county to make every effort possible to 
solicit the input of the citizens of Huntington Beach at every step of the 
process.

SCHOOL LAYOFFS PREVENT CUTS IN SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am responding to your two letter writers ("Wrong People Laid Off in Orange 
Schools," Feb. 13). First of all, no one wants to see any layoffs of school 
employees; particularly those who most affect our children's education. 
</P>
<P>
 I have three children attending Orange Unified public schools. The last thing 
I want to see is a cut in my children's educational services. 
</P>
<P>
 The layoffs are the result of nine months of failed contract negotiations with 
the classified union. It should be noted, however, that the teachers' union did 
reach an agreement with our administration, as unpleasant as that agreement was 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason that money has been so tight these last few years is quite simple. 
George Bush raised our taxes, Pete Wilson raised our taxes, and now Bill 
Clinton has raised our taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as the public continues to allow our politicians to raise taxes, 
thereby sucking money out of the private sector and shrinking the tax base, we 
will have fewer dollars to spend on education. 
</P>
<P>
 When I first came into office a little more than two years ago, our school 
district had roughly one-third fewer administrators than the number recommended 
by the state Department of Education. Since that time, we have left five 
additional vacated administrative positions unfilled! 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Unified certainly has its share of problems to overcome, but an 
overabundance of administrators is not one of them.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NEEDS A BASIC LESSON; * $1.35-MILLION WARNING TO 
ADMINISTRATORS: FIRINGS SHOULD BE FOR JUST CAUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton administrators are apparently the ones who need to learn a 
lesson, judging by a jury's verdict that Jim Huffman was wrongly fired as the 
women's volleyball coach after filing a sex discrimination case against the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court jury this month awarded Huffman $1.35 million in damages. 
Punitive damages will be decided later, and will be kept private. The verdict 
or the award could be overturned, or damages lessened, on appeal. But that will 
not erase the jury's finding that the university's explanation for firing 
Huffman was inadequate. It is easy to see why. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman coached the women's volleyball team to a woeful record of 25 wins and 
80 losses over three years. In January of 1992, Cal State Fullerton announced 
it was dropping the sport. Soon after, Huffman and others filed suit against 
the university, contending it was violating state laws by discriminating 
against women. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 20, 1992, a Superior Court judge ordered the university to reinstate 
the program. That was a Friday. The following Monday, the school fired Huffman. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a precedent-setting settlement of the bias lawsuit, Cal State 
Fullerton agreed to reinstate the women's volleyball team, add a women's soccer 
team and equalize spending on men's and women's sports within 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 While Cal State Fullerton appears to be getting the message about sex equity, 
it must now get the message about unfairly firing someone because he filed a 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The university contended Huffman's record as coach justified his firing. But 
Huffman supporters disagreed, as did the jury. Several knowledgeable witnesses 
testified that the Cal State Fullerton women's volleyball team made substantial 
progress under Huffman. One witness said that on the Friday before the firing, 
the vice president for academic affairs said the school had to "get rid of" 
Huffman because he had caused the university enough aggravation. 
</P>
<P>
 One juror said the university produced no "paper trail" to support its claim 
it wanted to fire Huffman several months earlier, but decided to let him and 
women's volleyball leave the campus at the same time to let him get a job 
elsewhere without having the blot of firing on his record. The timing, and lack 
of documentation, made it seem like retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 The university can ill-afford such legal findings. It must be sure that future 
terminations are for just cause and that its actions leading up to the firing 
will lead impartial observers to agree.

IT'S TIME TO STOP THE WITCH HUNTS; * STATE SEN. JOHN LEWIS NEEDS TO WORK ON 
COUNTY'S BEHALF, NOT ON HIS PERSONAL BATTLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Sen. John R. Lewis (R-Orange) appears to enjoy witch hunts more than the 
real work of a legislator: introducing bills, lobbying for their passage, 
getting them signed into law. Lewis' latest target is a real humdinger, the 
mother of a man who had the effrontery to run against him in the 1992 
Republican primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis trounced his opponent, Newport Beach attorney Todd Thakar. Yet the 
legislator was unhappy with what he took to be personal attacks, and he is 
getting his revenge now. But it isn't Thakar who is his target, but Thakar's 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson appointed Rosemary E. Thakar to the California State 
University Board of Trustees. She has twice been the unsuccessful Republican 
nominee for Congress from a Northern California district; she is a 
businesswoman; for 10 years she has been on the president's advisory board at 
San Francisco State University. Her nomination, which requires Senate approval, 
cleared a Senate committee with nary a dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Lewis has been working behind the scenes to block the appointment. A Lewis 
aide acknowledged that politics might be a factor, but said Lewis' real concern 
was ideological, that Rosemary Thakar is insufficiently conservative. The aide 
also claimed Thakar had "no special expertise" to bring to the post. Nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Lewis took out after Henry R. Wedaa, a Yorba Linda city councilman 
whom Lewis wants removed as chairman of the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District. Wedaa has been a target of conservatives who wrongly claim he is 
anti-business. Lewis managed to win passage of a bill making it easier to 
remove Wedaa from his post. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, while Lewis was still in the Assembly, a fellow Orange 
County Republican assemblyman said the reason he and Lewis introduced so few 
bills was their belief they were sent to Sacramento to decrease the size and 
influence of government. But Orange County needs more vigorous representation 
in Sacramento, not less. The ineffectiveness of the county's legislative 
delegation has been a sore spot with county officials who complain they get 
less than other counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County would be better off if Lewis would work on its behalf, rather 
than devoting himself to personal battles.

WATER DISTRICT ENTERS A CAUTIOUS NEW ERA; * CODE OF ETHICS WILL HELP PREVENT 
REPETITION OF ABUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The disclosures of the way things were at the Santa Margarita Water District 
keep dribbling out in a form reminiscent of water torture. And with each new 
name of someone who received gifts but did not report them comes a deeper 
understanding of the problems facing the district and the work the new 
directors must do to restore public confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year the general manager of the district, Walter W. (Bill) Knitz, and his 
assistant, Michael P. Lord, resigned after The Times disclosed their 
spendthrift ways with district funds. Both men are under investigation by the 
county district attorney and the FBI to determine if conflict-of-interest laws 
were violated. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the district's longtime board chairman, Don B. Schone, resigned 
hours after it was reported that he stayed in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, as the 
guest of Robert Bein, William Frost & Associates, an Irvine engineering firm. 
Schone did not file the conflict-of-interest forms required by the state. Nor 
did he abstain from voting on matters involving the engineering company, as 
required by state law. 
</P>
<P>
 Then The Times Orange County disclosed that the district's two top engineers 
were treated to hundreds of meals and gifts valued at nearly $12,000 by the 
Robert Bein firm. Bill Dye, the district's top engineer since 1979, did not 
report meals and gifts from anyone on the forms he was required to file every 
year under state conflict-of-interest laws. Dye's chief assistant, Dan Ferons, 
was not required to file the forms. The district's new general manager, John J. 
Schatz, said Dye and Ferons were complying with the rules as they understood 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Robert Bein company was awarded nearly $14 million in district contracts 
over the past five years and also gave more than $20,000 in gifts to Knitz and 
Lord. There have been no charges that the firm did anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosures of the gifts to Dye and Ferons did prompt Schatz wisely to 
order top district employees to amend their statements of economic interest, 
dating back a decade or more, to include any unreported free meals and gifts 
from those doing business with the district.  
</P>
<P>
 Schatz said he would also require more district employees to list all sources 
of income, which is good. Too many district officials took gifts from companies 
and then recommended that they receive contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Schatz defended Dye and Ferons, he acknowledged that even after the 
scandal broke, Dye "did not receive clear direction" that he should amend his 
financial statements for previous years, despite a seminar for all district 
workers on reporting requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Let there be no confusion in the future. The district should be sure that all 
employees understand the law and comply with it. 
</P>
<P>
 The district board has instituted one of the toughest codes of ethics of any 
public agency in California, a good start in preventing repetition of abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Another troubling practice was removed last year. Previously, staff members 
could recommend to committees which companies should receive contracts and then 
could vote on those committees. New procedures to avoid potential conflicts of 
interest allow staff members to recommend who should receive a contract, but 
not to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the reforms, the continuing disclosures show that the problems were 
systemic, and board members cannot assume their job is done after they 
promulgate ethics codes and new procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 They must stay on guard to be sure the codes and state laws are obeyed.

BLAME THE DEVELOPER, NOT THE COYOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Lori Klunder must be upset after losing (her pet cats) Bugsy and Bianca to 
coyotes. However, you cannot blame the coyote. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers and planning commissioners are the culprit. Money-hungry, uncaring, 
ignorant developers take over the land where these creatures have resided for 
centuries. Planning commissioners, most of whom are appointed and know nothing 
of the habitats of areas, approve plans to develop housing for people. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliminating and displacing animals is racism. The human race is superior and 
the animal kingdom is supposed to be the nothings of the world. Not true. 
Everything and everyone was put on this world for a purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us humans have enough sense to keep a balance. Everyone and everything has 
a place. However, the human race wants it all. The best advice is keep the 
kitties in the house, your dogs on a leash. Keep the land normal. Leave the 
coyote alone.

ELIMINATING GUNS WON'T ENSURE SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Two weeks after my July transfer from St. Callistus Church in Garden Grove, 
I read of the shooting death of Omar Acosta, a 15-year-old who had been my 
organist. I was saddened but not surprised. For months I had not felt safe in 
the area, hearing gunfire, seeing so much graffiti, and watching tough-looking, 
small groups of young men cruise around the church and its environs. A short 
time later, big headlines announced a three-county law enforcement sweep that 
had arrested 200 gang members, some of whom were associated with the shooting 
death of my organist. It seemed very impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 Against this backdrop, I am amazed that so many politicians' solution to the 
criminal violence is to ban all firearms. It further amazes me to see the 
concerted effort to blame "assault weapons" and "semi-automatic" guns for our 
present misery, as if the presence of these things were somehow a new 
development. "Eliminate guns, then we will be safe." This skewed thinking 
delays our addressing the real issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, we have seen that gang members are quite capable of killing people 
with metal rods. In Santa Ana, some gangs rely upon baseball bats, and have we 
forgotten about knives? Will we close early all piers and parks because of the 
violence there? Is punishing the ordinary people the just way to handle our 
problems? 
</P>
<P>
 Guns are harder to buy legally than they were in 1968. The guns have not 
changed, people have changed. Recently, our President said that if American 
hearts do not change for the better, all the gun laws in the world will not 
bring us peace in our streets. 
</P>
<P>
 We must begin to deal with the real issues.

 * Your editorial ("Ducky Idea," Feb. 10) concerning Disney's "guns for 
tickets" promotion could have included the fact that Disney is attempting to 
have the citizens of Anaheim pay for about half of the proposed team-practice 
ice rink (cost of the land). Also, the editorial could have mentioned that it 
is costing Anaheim millions of dollars each year to provide the Anaheim Arena 
(Pond) where the Mighty Ducks have all of those sellout hockey games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guns for tickets" has very questionable public safety value if any at all. 
Its real purpose could be just a publicity stunt by Disney to obtain support 
for more public funds from Anaheim, such as for Disneyland's planned Westcot 
expansion.

ROHRABACHER'S STAND ON IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Regarding Antonio Asasta Sweet's diatribe, (Letters, Feb. 6): He writes that 
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) is a racist and is dehumanizing and 
criminalizing a whole population! What tommyrot. Rohrabacher has never referred 
to American citizens (as Acosta wrote he became) in his efforts for justice, 
only to illegal immigrants in this country.Acosta Sweet is the one who has his 
facts incorrect. Congrats, Acosta Sweet, on being a wage-earner, professional 
and "educated." Is this how we are rewarded for giving citizenship and 
educating people that come from other countries? 
</P>
<P>
 There are too many people like Acosta Sweet jumping on the word racism as soon 
as illegal immigrants are mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 We need more Dana Rohrabachers representing our districts.

FULLERTON, WESTMINSTER RECALL EFFORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It is time to hear from the many Fullerton citizens who stand behind their 
elected city members who are being threatened with recall for voting for a 2% 
utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton is considered one of the most fiscally responsible cities in the 
state. Unlike surrounding cities, Fullerton leaders since Proposition 13 have 
worked diligently to avoid additional taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's compare the utility taxes of our neighboring cities before we condemn 
those who are trying to keep responsible government in Fullerton and the 
standards we all enjoy: 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park, 2%; Huntington Beach, 5%; Irvine, 1.5%; La Habra, 6%; Los 
Alamitos, 6%; Placentia, 3%; Santa Ana, 5%; Seal Beach, 11%; Stanton, 6% and 
Westminster, 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's 2% utility tax is not out of line. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton voters should consider the following facts: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Recalling the three council members (Molly) McClanahan, (A.B.) Catlin, and 
(Don) Bankhead will not repeal the utility user tax. 
</P>
<P>
 2. The total cost to Fullerton taxpayers for the recall process, including a 
special election, will be around a quarter of a million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Recall should only be used for malfeasance or dereliction of duty, which no 
one has alleged against these people. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Our regular election process is a better way to express dissatisfaction 
with those we elected by an overwhelming margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you signed the recall petitions, please re-examine the facts before 
voting for recall of these fiscally responsible council members and the city 
clerk who was only carrying out her assigned duties. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * The Westminster City Council members have egg on their faces and are 
desperate to draw attention away from themselves, and are attacking the 
firefighters of this city. 
</P>
<P>
 They are making claims of overtime fraud allegedly perpetrated by the 
firefighters union. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, an audit found that the firefighters were not paid more than owed under 
terms of their contract with the city, which was approved over two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 How can the firefighters be blamed for wrongdoing if they were following their 
contractual agreement? 
</P>
<P>
 This City Council has continuously been telling the public one thing while 
doing something different. 
</P>
<P>
 First, they removed six firefighters and a firetruck from service while saying 
they were not cutting services. I guess they can't do simple math, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, not acknowledging 14,000 signatures of residents who asked that they 
reconsider this decision was a big political faux pas. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, they made statements saying they were not going to refit the existing 
paramedic vans to make them medical transport vehicles. Instead they purchased 
two new ambulances for nearly a quarter of a million dollars and hired 16 new 
EMTs, not paramedics, to man these vehicles. This circus and these smear 
tactics have got to end. 
</P>
<P>
 Term limits should begin in our own back yards. Mayor Charles V. Smith has 
become far too comfortable in his high-backed chair. Tony Lam, Charmayne Bohman 
and Craig Schweisinger also need to be sent packing. 
</P>
<P>
 We need new leadership in this community, and the current recall campaign in 
progress will begin that process.

PRAISE FOR SEN. MARIAN BERGESON AND HER RECORD IN SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your article, "O.C's Bergeson Has Proved a Capitol Asset, (Feb.13)," lists 
legislative accomplishments of our state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport 
Beach). 
</P>
<P>
 It does not mention "The Bergeson Act." Naming a law after one of its members 
is a special way in which legislators honor a colleague. Offhand, I can't think 
of anyone else Orange County currently sends to Sacramento that has been so 
honored. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bergeson Act" is the California Teacher Credentialing law of 1988. It has 
had two effects -- one intended, the other not. The intended effect was to 
boost teacher standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The unintended effect comes from entrusting responsibility for policing 
teacher training to a bureaucracy more sensitive to the institutions it is 
supposed to police than to the public in whose name it polices them. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) grants repeated 
postponements of evaluation to the UC Irvine Education Department. It will soon 
be three years after that was originally scheduled. To Orange Countians, who 
wish to input in that re-approval process, the CTC is trying to say, "no way," 
in spite of Bergeson Act provisions for "the community" to be involved. Sen. 
Bergeson deserves commendation for the Bergeson Act and praise for the extent 
to which it provides children with better teachers. How bureaucracy handles her 
law deserves a thorough performance review. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Thanks for a terrific article on Marian Bergeson. It made the point very 
nicely that a class act is a class act whether it is in Sacramento or Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 As a negotiator, Marian has felt that almost anything can be accomplished when 
you get everyone to the table. When things seem stalled on dead center (beach 
curfews, and county transportation issues come to mind), she always manages to 
find an area of agreement between the disparate opinions -- whether it's 
conservatives versus liberals, or cities fighting the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The only way her departure from the Legislature could hurt Orange County would 
be if she packed up and went home for good. Having her on the (county) Board of 
Supervisors will mean a new venue for her, but the same determination and 
intelligence working for us. All of us. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Your article on Marian Bergeson's expected departure from the state Senate 
leaves me more than a little concerned about our county's legislative 
representation once she leaves. If Bergeson was such the hard worker, where has 
the rest of the 13-member delegation been? 
</P>
<P>
 Here's hoping that Bergeson's successor will somehow emulate the 
characteristics that made her successful -- honesty and integrity, conservatism 
with a smile, persistence behind the scenes, and a willingness to look for a 
sound solution before looking for a sound bite. 
</P>
<P>
 If we can't find a suitable replacement, will the county consider letting 
Bergeson job-share?

SOME GOOD NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Many days I read in the newspaper of shootings and many other inhumanities.I 
feel the need to tell you about another brand of news. One night recently I 
went to see "Schindler's List" at the Cinemapolis in Anaheim Hills. The next 
morning, I realized I had lost my valuable watch, with the little diamonds all 
around. When I drove to the theater, a cleaning person by the name of Tom had 
picked it up and it was waiting for me.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON RACIAL EQUALITY; BLACKS NEED TO ENSURE THEY 
PARTAKE IN SHARED POWER, PRIVILEGE; O.C.'S AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY MUST 
REDEFINE, RESHAPE, REFORM AND RESTRUCTURE THE PURPOSE AND GOAL OF PROGRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McREYNOLDS, John McReynolds is senior pastor at the Second Baptist 
Church in Santa Ana. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1967, Stokely Carmichael and Charles Hamilton, in their book titled "Black 
Power: The Politics of Liberation in America," defined racism as being " . . . 
the predication of decisions and policies on consideration of race for the 
purpose of subordinating a racial group." With this factor as a foundation for 
liberation within the black community, there is the productivity of progress 
predicated upon the dogma of victimization. 
</P>
<P>
 The demographics of Orange County inform us that the African American 
community is approximately 2% of the total Orange County population, and 
because of the strategic uniqueness of the multiethnic character of Orange 
County, the dynamics of social-racial integration will perhaps indicate just 
how good race relations are between blacks and whites. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a notable feature of our community that blacks are very well integrated 
into the social dynamics of our community. However, the character of 
socialization in Orange County has presented black leadership with obvious 
problems and difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 A monolithic view of racial equity stipulates that the design of social 
integration is designed after the 1960s model, wherein in one specific view of 
integration is that of African Americans being mainstreamed into the cultural 
whole of society. 
</P>
<P>
 However, even with the sociological gains of the 1960s and '70s, the black 
community within Orange County still struggles with the issues of identity, and 
political and socioeconomic success within the multiethnic and cultural context 
of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 It is still an acknowledged fact that African Americans are yet denied avenues 
of certain areas of politics in our communities at large. The question still 
remains as to whether or not it is because of the dynamics of racism in Orange 
County, or the lack of preparation of blacks to participate in these social 
avenues of power. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been demonstrated beyond any doubt that the African American community 
in Orange County is academically and sociologically prepared to participate in 
the growth and development of our community. The real issue is whether or not 
the non-black ethnic groups are willing to allow this participation to occur. 
</P>
<P>
 What must be remembered regarding integration is that social integration of 
African Americans was not only meant to be a matter of social privilege, but 
that also African Americans would be allowed to partake in the mediums of 
shared power alongside of shared privilege. One of the major concerns in Orange 
County in some African American circles is whether or not those blacks that are 
given some of the positions of power and responsibility are victims of 
neo-tokenism in order to assuage the social pain of "some," while distributing 
some elements of the power to the "few." 
</P>
<P>
 African Americans in Orange County, on the whole, have many of the same hopes, 
dreams and aspirations as other ethnic groups within the community. However, 
with this being said, the African American community still waits with 
anticipation on being able to elect one of their own to the Board of 
Supervisors, or to a City Council, or to represent the interests of the entire 
community in Congress or in our state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 These and many other issues are complex. In a neo-liberation-oriented era, 
wherein the desire for rights, freedoms and privileges is seen in every aspect 
of American socialization, there is a need within the black community in Orange 
County to redefine, reshape, reform and restructure the purpose and goal of 
black progress. 
</P>
<P>
 In our community, black progress can no longer allow racial pain and angry 
urban plight to speak for the quest of liberation and its ultimate goals. The 
anger of the ghetto is caused not only by an anger toward the oppression of the 
past but also the anger and bitterness that exist within middle-class blacks in 
Orange County, because they are denied participation in every area of social 
mobility within our community. 
</P>
<P>
 To overcome this, the black community must consider developing networking 
family coalitions that can impact the political arena of every community where 
they live. They must come together and seek innovative measures as to how they 
will elect themselves to unified school boards and city councils and become 
county supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the other ethnic groups must begin to apply the principle of 
honorable ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 All blacks are not liberal Democrats, and not all blacks are socially, 
politically and economically monolithic. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the community at large must become socially educated to the 
academically and economically viable African American community in Orange 
County, which desires also to express its own high privilege.

SET SCHEDULE IS NEEDED FOR FEB. HOLIDAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Am I confused, or wasn't there a decision a few years ago to consolidate 
Lincoln's Birthday (Feb. 12) and Washington's Birthday (Feb. 22) holidays into 
one Monday holiday, celebrated somewhere in between the two? 
</P>
<P>
 As I recall, the Monday holiday arrangement would establish a legal holiday 
called Presidents' Day which banks, schools and government offices would 
observe.It would also create a three-day weekend for workers. 
</P>
<P>
 What I have noticed these past few years is that various businesses and 
government agencies have reverted back to celebrating the February holidays 
whenever they please. For example, I was hoping to use the public library in El 
Toro Saturday, Feb. 12, but it was closed for Lincoln's Birthday. The school 
district for which I work observed Monday, Feb. 14, for Lincoln's birthday and 
the legal holiday Monday, Feb. 21, for Presidents' Day. Who knows, perhaps some 
organizations are celebrating Tuesday, Feb. 22, as Washington's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 I am finding it very frustrating each year trying to figure out who is open 
when. Shouldn't we make a decision once and for all and have all government 
agencies observe that holiday schedule?

EYES ON A COSMIC PRIZE; ARIANNA HUFFINGTON WANTS TO DO MORE THAN HELP HER 
HUSBAND WIN A SEAT IN THE SENATE. SHE IS ALSO TRYING TO RAISE POLITICS TO A 
HIGHER PLANE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE LACHER, LOS ANGELES TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arianna Stassinopolous Huffington was framed in American flags. 
</P>
<P>
 To her right drooped Old Glory. To her left, the California bear. Before her 
was splayed a veritable cornucopia of Orange County Young Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Summoning all the wit and finesse she had earned long ago as head of the 
Cambridge University debating society, the elegant author, socialite and 
congressional spouse set to work on her unsuspecting audience. Her mission: to 
nudge the Grand Old Party into examining its collective soul. 
</P>
<P>
 And, oh yes, help her husband, Michael, win Democrat Dianne Feinstein's Senate 
seat in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not enough for (President) Clinton to fail for us to succeed," she said 
to the hushed hotel function room in Costa Mesa, the heart of California 
Republican-land and home to Michael Huffington for Senate headquarters. 
"Ultimately, we need to provide the American people with an alternate vision." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, 43, statuesque in a Carolina Herrera pleated brown suit and auburn 
coif, laid out her case. Cribbing from her startling speech -- "Can 
Conservatives Have a Social Conscience?" -- that gently chastened a National 
Review magazine conference in Washington a year ago, Huffington reminded her 
fellow social policy critics that if government were to drop the welfare ball, 
they would all do well to pick it up. In Huffington's ideal future, a "critical 
mass" of spiritually inclined citizens would succeed where government had 
failed, volunteering time and money en masse to care for the tired and poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see it as a scientific equivalent of grace," she said in velvet tones laced 
with hints of her native Greece. "We do our part and God meets us halfway. 
That's why I'm a conservative. Because conservatives believe in the 
individual." 
</P>
<P>
 The wife of the Santa Barbara Republican opened the floor to questions. 
Despite her inch-by-inch, speech-by-speech campaign aimed at nothing less than 
a spiritual overhaul of the Republican Party and eventually the country, her 
speech whizzed by the kempt heads of her audience. Instead of marching toward 
the millennium as spiritual soldiers defending a shrinking government, they 
seemed like holdouts from the Me Generation. 
</P>
<P>
 What was Michael's position on federal taxes? And the National Endowment for 
the Arts? And, from a young Republican in a tight blond bun, what does he plan 
to do about illegal immigration -- "since you're an immigrant"? 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, people are preoccupied with the obvious political issues," 
Huffington said later. "I think when you expand the political debate to areas 
which are not the traditional issues of crime, economy and jobs, they're more 
likely to ask questions about what they're familiar with.  
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't see it as an indication that they're not listening. I intend to 
spend the next months drumming that message up and down the state." 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers believe the Huffingtons' sights include far more than 
California. Noting Michael's quick bid for the Senate after less than two years 
in the House, they speculate that the couple has its eyes on the ultimate 
political prize -- the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is interesting is the way people think that you want to be in the White 
House," Huffington said in an interview, perched on a pastel couch in their 
L.A. pied a terre. "To me, that is a very small ambition. There are many people 
who have been in the White House and have achieved nothing dramatic. What we 
are talking about is a crusade, which is so much bigger than being in the White 
House . . . to achieve this critical mass that can change our country. 
</P>
<P>
 "In that sense, my quote unquote ambitions are a lot larger than the ones 
people are assigning to me, and larger in the sense that they're not personal." 
</P>
<P>
 If Huffington fails to enlist a country's worth of eager recruits, it won't be 
for want of trying. In May, Simon & Schuster will publish her manifesto, "The 
Fourth Instinct: The Call of the Soul." Huffington's sixth book argues that big 
government cheats people out of the spiritual rewards of giving to the needy. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, a cable-TV show, as well as the recruitment soirees she calls 
"critical mass" dinners and the Senate race are the latest salvos in 
Huffington's longstanding and sometimes controversial campaign to mesh 
ostensible opposites -- spirituality and the halls of power. 
</P>
<P>
 Her latest bout is winning praise from fellow conservatives and spiritual 
leaders. Film critic Michael Medved, who appeared on National Empowerment 
Television's "Critical Mass" to discuss Hollywood as an enemy of traditional 
values, applauded her efforts to be "inclusive in assembling this critical 
mass." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's being inclusive in the political spectrum and within the religious 
world. I think she's going out of her way to work together with people from 
every kind of faith and community rather than rooting it firmly in one aspect 
of that community or another," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Huffington raised eyebrows in an earlier campaign she waged on behalf of 
New Age leader John-Roger, the former Rosemead schoolteacher and founder of 
Insight and the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness (MSIA). Huffington, 
herself an MSIA minister, tapped her social contacts in the mid-'80s to woo 
high society proponents to John-Roger's cause, holding recruitment dinners that 
sandwiched socialites between acolytes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had him thrust upon me by her," nationally syndicated columnist Liz Smith 
said. "He really sort of gave me the creeps. He wanted to lay hands on me 
because I had a headache and it was very dismaying and embarrassing to me. And 
also I thought he was a fake." 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, Huffington publicly reveled in her connection to John-Roger. In 
a 1985 article for Interview magazine, she wrote: "He dealt in the only thing 
that I was really interested in: helping people wake up to the spirit inside 
themselves, to their natural knowing and inner wisdom. I bought his books 
(ranging from 'The Inner Worlds of Meditation' to 'Sex, Spirit and You'); I 
subscribed to his monthly discourses; I went to meditation retreats." 
</P>
<P>
 John-Roger, whose foundation is based in Santa Monica, declared himself the 
embodiment of a Christlike entity called "Mystical Traveler Consciousness." But 
in the late '80s, he came under fire in the press for allegedly sexually 
seducing followers with spiritual promises, being hypocritical about the vow of 
poverty that kept him from paying taxes and being cavalier with church funds. 
He denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Huffingtons now soft-pedal Arianna's connection to John-Roger, whom she 
met in London in 1973. She says that they see each other socially and that she 
last took a seminar a year ago, "although I would be glad to take one if I had 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
 "John-Roger is a friend," said Huffington, a member of the Greek Orthodox 
Church. "And I get a lot of value from his seminars and his books. Why he's so 
attacked and why people are trying to present him as some kind of guru figure, 
I really don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Huffington, 46, an Episcopalian who doesn't share her interest in 
John-Roger, said: "It was before I met her, so I wasn't knowledgeable. I think 
John-Roger is a friend of hers. That's about all I really know about it." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, while "The Fourth Instinct" quotes myriad sources, nowhere does 
John-Roger's name appear. Huffington says he influenced her book "no more than 
hundreds of people, ranging from Jung and the Bible to friends who have been on 
some kind of spiritual path." In addition to John-Roger, she has befriended 
Werner Erhard and sampled est. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans perceive her critical mass campaign as compatible with mainstream 
conservative views. 
</P>
<P>
 Linking spirituality with politics "is a two-edged sword," said Howard Hull, 
former president of the Orange County Young Republicans. "It can be linked to 
extremism and linked to moderation. Moderation is, 'I may be very religious, I 
may be Christian, but I have Muslim friends and friends of the Jewish faith.' 
That's no problem. Extremism is, 'It's my way or the highway.' But I don't see 
that at all. Her views are right along party lines." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, questions about Huffington's connection to John-Roger linger in 
the press as the couple raises its political sights and stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Colacello, who investigated their relationship for Vanity Fair in 1986, 
said: "If she's sincere in her New Age beliefs, then she's not very bright, and 
if she is very bright, then I don't see how she could be sincere in believing 
some of the things that she claims to believe. To me, that's the paradox of 
Arianna Stassinopolous Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 "My real issue with her as a political figure, as someone who is married to a 
man with great political ambitions -- and they both have admitted they 
influence each other tremendously, as do every husband and wife -- is I don't 
understand what her spiritualism is about, and it frightens me to think that 
this kind of fuzzy but all-encompassing spiritualism could have an influence on 
our politics, on our government." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's spiritual yearnings go way back to her childhood in Greece. She 
says she remembers praying to the Virgin Mary unbidden at the age of 3. Thus 
began a spiritual journey that took 16-year-old Arianna to Shantaniketan 
University, outside Calcutta, where she studied comparative religions. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, she moved with her mother -- divorced from her journalist 
father -- to England to prepare for university entrance exams. At Cambridge, 
Arianna Stassinopolous was a star, making media waves as the first foreigner 
and third woman to head the Cambridge Union -- the same year another female 
foreigner, Benazir Bhutto, headed the rival Oxford debate team. 
</P>
<P>
 For her farewell debate, she skewered late-'70s feminism for ignoring "a 
woman's special needs" for children and family. Her televised address prompted 
English publisher Reg Davis-Poynter to offer her a book deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Considered an answer to "The Female Eunuch," her 1973 book was called "The 
Female Woman." She was attacked for being anti-feminist, even though she 
supported equal rights and work opportunities for women. 
</P>
<P>
 The first book also made her a celebrity author fresh out of school. And she 
says she was on book tour in Detroit when she was struck by the emptiness of 
her early success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything went wrong. I was on my own. I got to the hotel, and there was a 
line of 200 GIs checking in, so I had to wait. Then I got into my room, and it 
was the tiniest little room, a postage stamp that smelled of cigarette smoke, 
and there I was. I had nothing to do that night and I had to leave at 5 in the 
morning to go on an early morning talk show, and I suddenly felt this total, 
utter depression and despair. What am I doing here?" 
</P>
<P>
 She returned from her tour, drew the drapes of her London apartment and 
embarked on a long water fast -- "mostly because I so wanted to touch the 
spirit, to be filled by it, that anything that was not spirit or about spirit 
was an encumbrance," she writes in "The Fourth Instinct." 
</P>
<P>
 She ultimately realized that starvation was no solution, "although not before 
I could, blindfolded, tell the difference between sipsful of the various brands 
of bottled water I had in my flat." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, she published her second and least successful book, the scholarly 
"After Reason." Although the difficult book was little read, it held the seeds 
of her current campaign. In it, she argued that 20th-Century prosperity failed 
to satisfy mankind's deepest needs for meaning, and that a spiritual revolution 
was in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw myself more as a polemicist," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But her career reputation was soon sealed as a biographer. Already a fixture 
of English society, her connections led to the book contract that changed her 
as a writer. Her friend, publisher George Weidenfeld, suggested that she write 
a biography of Maria Callas soon after the singer's death, partly because the 
two Greek women bore a certain resemblance. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1981 book, "Maria Callas: The Woman Behind the Legend," was an 
international bestseller, displaying her talent for unearthing the stormy 
personal details of her subjects' lives. Her Callas biography stated that the 
singer's longtime lover, Aristotle Onassis, was planning to divorce Jacqueline 
Kennedy Onassis, whom he called "cold-hearted and shallow," shortly before his 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She went to New York to promote "Maria Callas" and immediately felt as though 
she had arrived home. She settled there in the early '80s and took the town by 
social storm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely had a very social 3 1/2 years. They gave me the sobriquet of 
socialite and I earned it!" she said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Walters served as her bridesmaid and is godmother to her oldest 
daughter. "The word special is extremely overused, but she's a very special 
person," Walters said of Huffington. "She is very brilliant, very sensitive. 
She's wonderful looking. I feel she has a conscience and a caring." 
</P>
<P>
 One person's special person is another one's social climber, and Huffington 
has been criticized for being socially ambitious. Still, even her critics say 
they like her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Arianna became very famous very young," said John O'Sullivan, editor 
of the National Review and a friend dating back to her London days. "She 
conquered London in the '70s, New York in the '80s and is now doing the same on 
the West Coast in the '90s. People with this kind of drive and success are 
always going to incite envy, but she's basically good-natured and level-headed. 
She's never been deceived by success and put off by envy."  
</P>
<P>
 Said journalist Colacello: "I think she's a highly desirable dinner-party 
guest. She's intelligent. She's articulate. She's beautiful. She knows how to 
really focus in on what the other person is saying. She's a great, great 
flatterer and we've all been seduced by it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she's a fascinating character and I wouldn't be surprised if she does 
reach the top or get pretty damn near to it. Because she is relentless. Because 
she does have the discipline of a religious zealot. Because she has a very rich 
husband. Because she's smart." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, Huffington moved to Beverly Hills. An important California friend was 
Francoise Gilot, wife of Jonas Salk and Pablo Picasso's former longtime 
mistress and the mother of two of his children. Huffington had sought her out 
for her new biography of Picasso, and her scathing memories of abuse helped 
fuel the fire that swirled around the author's 1988 book, "Picasso: Creator and 
Destroyer." 
</P>
<P>
 The critics' reaction was ferocious. 
</P>
<P>
 Newsweek called it "one-sided and hate-filled" and the New York Times sniffed: 
"Mrs. Huffington writes about Picasso's life as though she were breathlessly 
narrating a trashy novel." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington seems to relish the furor. "I think the reaction went much deeper 
than just challenging an idol like Picasso," she said. "I sum up what I believe 
about art, and why I don't believe Picasso was as great an artist as 
Shakespeare and Mozart and Rembrandt. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, really great art transcends the darkness, but if you look at a lot of 
Picasso's late art or if you look at Francis Bacon, it's like the crucifixion 
without the resurrection. Everything is dark." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The most influential friend from that period may have the socially prominent 
Ann Getty, another Weidenfeld contact. She took on the project of getting the 
thirtysomething Stassinopolous married, and during a 1985 flight drew up a list 
of prospects for her friend, among them conductor Claudio Abbado. 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, Getty met Michael Huffington in Tokyo at a board meeting of the 
Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael thought his idea of who he was going to marry was somebody blond and 
in her early 20s and willing to have five children. He said to her, 'You're so 
wonderful. Do you have any daughters?' 
</P>
<P>
 "And Ann said, 'I don't have any daughters, but I have a great friend. She's 
not blond and she's not in her 20s.' And she called me and told me she had met 
the man I was going to marry." 
</P>
<P>
 Getty orchestrated a three-day blind date -- with other people, including 
Huffington's friend, Dole Chairman David Murdock. They attended the San 
Francisco Opera, threading the days with lunches and dinners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I immediately saw her as my soul mate," Huffington said. "When we met, I 
said, 'What's the most important thing in your life?' She said, 'God.' " 
</P>
<P>
 They married seven months later -- in April, 1986 -- and Vanity Fair called 
their Park Avenue wedding "the one people are still talking about" in a banner 
wedding year that included Prince Andrew's and Caroline Kennedy's. 
</P>
<P>
 The 400-person guest list consisted of a melange of high society and 
John-Roger followers. Huffington wore a Galanos dress variously reported as 
costing $18,000 to $35,000, and she was flanked by bridesmaids who included 
Walters and Lucky Roosevelt, President Reagan's White House chief of protocol. 
</P>
<P>
 The reception was testimony to the bride's talent for friendship -- Getty paid 
for it. Henry Kissinger has been widely quoted as saying the wedding had 
"everything except an Aztec sacrificial fire dance," although Huffington says 
that was apocryphal. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Michael Huffington's family had been prominent in Houston, where his father, 
Roy, made the family fortune by founding an oil company, Roy M. Huffington 
Inc., a.k.a. Huffco. The Huffington coffers have been estimated at $350 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington says she sees no contradiction between living a life that's both 
luxurious and spiritual: "I don't think having a beautiful home or having 
beautiful things is a problem in itself. Far from it. It's the difference 
between being in the background of your life or being in the foreground." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple settled in a $4-million Italian villa in Montecito. They've stopped 
giving interviews there in the wake of accusations that the freshman 
congressman bought his seat by outspending his opponent, nine-term Republican 
Rep. Bob Lagomarsino. Huffington spent $3 million on the primary, more than any 
other congressional candidate in the country's history. Huffington denies that 
the home has become a political liability. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at Ross Perot," she said. "He does all his interviews in his home or his 
private plane. I think Perot used his wealth to show he's independent, to show 
he can't be bought, that he's not in politics for reasons of personal gain. So 
it's not a campaign consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Huffingtons don't at all mind Michael's sobriquet, 
"Perot-by-the-Sea." With their voluntarism spin on it, they've founded the 
Partnership for the Children of Santa Barbara, which provides medical care, 
partly with the help of Michael's first-year congressional salary -- $133,600. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington says her concern for children stems in part from her love for her 
own -- Christina, 4 1/2, and Isabella, 2 1/2. She says motherhood has been a 
profoundly transforming experience. And in "The Fourth Instinct," she reveals 
that she had an out-of-body experience a few hours after Christina's birth:  
</P>
<P>
 "We put her in a crib next to my bed. A few moments later, after everyone had 
left the room, I began trembling convulsively. . . . And then my body was no 
longer shaking. I had left it. I was looking down at myself, at Christina, at 
the tuberoses on the night stand, at the entire room.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had no fear at all. . . . I knew I would return. And I was being washed in 
a sense of enormous well-being and strength. It was as if the curtain of heaven 
had been pulled back to give me a glimpse of wholeness: birth, life and death 
-- and seeing them all at once, I could accept them all." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Huffington largely disappeared from public view as a new mother, some 
people have tagged her as the engine for Michael's political ambitions. Michael 
denies the scuttlebutt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I chuckle," he said. "First of all, if one looks back at the record, which 
people don't do, the first time I walked precincts in politics was in '68, when 
Reagan was running for President. I was a student senator at Stanford and 
co-president of the senior class. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a naive statement or an uninformed statement that Arianna got me to run 
for office. I've been doing that since I was 20 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 Now their respective campaigns have become one. "Michael is helping me," 
Huffington said, by introducing legislation this month to make volunteering 
more attractive, by eliminating the tax rule that says the first 3% of income 
donated to charity is not deductible and by giving people 
minimum-wage-equivalent tax breaks for donating their time. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they both talk the spirituality-in-politics talk, Huffington says she 
would carry on her crusade with or without her husband's political platform. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you had to convince everybody, it would not be doable," she said. "It's 
not an intellectual convincing. It's more like a catching. Catch the spirit of 
it. Then if enough people are doing this, it will spread like a positive 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're doing your part, and I do my part, and So-and-So does his little 
part, the whole thing mysteriously -- that's the thing -- beyond logic, will 
change everything."

<P>
 Nightclub deejays do more than play songs that make people dance. They set the 
mood, the flavor of a club, and can change it instantly with the spin of a 
turntable. 
</P>
<P>
 With thousands of records in their repertoire, they travel from club to club 
establishing followings of clubbies addicted to hip-hop, funk, '70s disco and 
oldies. Marques Wyatt 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 29 
</P>
<P>
 Music Style: House, acid jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Current Clubs: Brass, Does Your Mama Know, Velvet Crush 
</P>
<P>
 Clubography: Prague, Wild Rice, Maxx, Egg Salad, Lost Angels, Mayan, Stock 
Exchange, Power Tools. 
</P>
<P>
 It All Started When . . .: "Deejaying started out as just a hobby. First I did 
small parties, then I started my own club, BBC. Then my name got around to 
promoters and they started hiring me out. I had a friend who was a deejay, and 
I started picking up things from him, but no one ever really showed me how to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 First Gig: "It was for a high school party in Santa Monica. Was I nervous? Not 
really. I discovered nervousness later on." 
</P>
<P>
 On Mood and Music: "I set the mood myself. I think most of the gigs I get 
hired for, they want my music. It's key as far as I'm concerned to be in 
control and take the crowd on a journey. I feel like in a way I'm manipulating 
the crowd. It becomes like second nature -- instead of me thinking about 
setting the mood, I get to a point where I think I have them, and then I start 
trying other things. I use other songs as bait, and then kind of move into my 
own things." 
</P>
<P>
 When You Want to Make Them Get Up and Dance: "Aretha Franklin's 'A Deeper 
Love,' 'Givin' It Up' by Incognito and a remix of Soul II Soul's 'Back to 
Life.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Contribution to the L.A. Club Scene: "Taking the club population to another 
level, introducing them to a new form of music. That's usually what it comes 
down to, me introducing the circuit to something that would be considered an 
underground form of music and bringing it closer to the surface." 
</P>
<P>
 Choice of Music When Not Working: "All kinds. I usually like to listen to 
something a little bit mellow. I'm starting to get into a lot of Brazilian 
stuff, Latin jazz. And I love rock. I grew up with rock." 
</P>
<P>
 Number of Records You Own: 18,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Do You Wear Earplugs?: "No, but I'm going to start. It's not too late. Most of 
the time I'm working in a booth, but there's something about being on the 
floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Where Do You Go From Here?: "I started my own record label about eight months 
ago. It's called Brass Recordings, and it's a division of Delicious Vinyl. I 
also have some things in the works as far as doing a kind of show that could be 
pretty interesting. Sometimes at the club I do an interactive thing with live 
musicians, and they always want to stay. But I think I'm more into being a 
deejay now than ever, and I've been doing it a long time. . . . It never gets 
too monotonous for me. . . . I feel like I'm turning people on to something new 
constantly." Mike Messex 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 28 
</P>
<P>
 Music Style: Funk, soul, reggae, hip-hop, oldies. 
</P>
<P>
 Current Clubs: Friday nights at Dragonfly, Saturday Night Fever, every other 
Sunday at 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Clubography: Power Tools, Dirt Box, Opus Lilly, Impala. 
</P>
<P>
 It All Started When . . .: "I was working at Flip (the now-defunct clothing 
store on Melrose). I was in charge of the shoe department. But there was a 
booth and there were a couple of people in there playing records. When they 
weren't there, I'd change the records. The woman who ran the store said, 'Mike, 
why don't you deejay?' I'd take my paycheck and go to the local record store 
and buy used records. Then people would say, 'You play such good music. Would 
you do a party for us?' Then I got into the mobile deejay thing. That's how I 
learned how to make people happy, how to talk to people, how to be a good host 
and good deejay at the same time. From there I started doing my own clubs, and 
it progressed." 
</P>
<P>
 First Gig: "A wedding." 
</P>
<P>
 On Mood and Music: "When I used to deejay at Roxbury, I knew from experience 
that the people who go there aren't the hippest people on the planet. So I'd 
play some stuff that people wanted to listen to -- stuff on MTV, radio, not too 
pop-y. Then I'd kick in all the funk jams I like to play, the Mike Messex super 
funk jams. At my own clubs, I'd play everything from Tom Jones to Run-DMC to 
Bob Marley, some KROQ new wave, Black Crows, Led Zeppelin, Aretha Franklin. 
I've been playing the disco stuff for years at my clubs." 
</P>
<P>
 When You Want to Make Them Get Up and Dance: "You can always get people on the 
dance floor with 'Brick House,' 'I Will Survive,' 'Got to Be Real,' all those 
campy disco songs. Also hip-hop, whatever's currently on the radio." 
</P>
<P>
 Your Contribution to the L.A. Club Scene: "It's always been giving somebody 
the guarantee that if they see my name on the flyer, they're guaranteed to have 
a good time. And if they have my phone number, they can probably get on the 
guest list." 
</P>
<P>
 Choice of Music When You're Not Working: "I used to listen to KDAY (the former 
AM rap station), and KGFJ-FM, and on AM I listen to KNX, KRLA and KMPC. Also 
classic rock." 
</P>
<P>
 Number of Records You Own: 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Do You Wear Earplugs? "I usually wear headphones." 
</P>
<P>
 Where Do You Go From Here?: "What I'm getting into lately is owning clubs. I 
know just from watching people how to run things correctly, who does and 
doesn't have money. I just keep my ears open for bars and clubs. Or I'd like to 
own a record company. I'd like to own Sony Records and Paramount Pictures." Rob 
Harris 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 26 
</P>
<P>
 Music Style: Hip-hop, funk, house. 
</P>
<P>
 Current Clubs: Naive, Empire, Society 
</P>
<P>
 Clubography: Orbit, Truth, the Boogie Lounge, Roxbury, Jamaica House, Shelter, 
Dragonfly, Maxx 
</P>
<P>
 It All Started When . . .: "I started doing parties in high school, then some 
teen clubs in the South Bay area. When I was a senior I started making the move 
up to L.A. I started collecting records when I got into high school. I've 
always been into music. I'm always out record shopping." 
</P>
<P>
 First gig: "I went to Mira Costa High School in Manhattan Beach, and I'd do 
little parties and dances." 
</P>
<P>
 On Mood and Music: "A room has a certain vibe about it. I play off the crowd, 
but I work that in combination with delivering what I would like the crowd to 
vibe off of. I mostly play off of the crowd. My main priority is to get a good 
energy going in the room. I'm looking for what people are responding to. A 
place can have a certain kind of energy one night, and a completely different 
energy another night." 
</P>
<P>
 When You Want to Make Them Get Up and Dance: "A Tribe Called Quest, the new 
Snoop Dogg." 
</P>
<P>
 Contribution to the L.A. Club Scene: "I think I've contributed a wide variety 
format which pleases people who can appreciate different types of music, from 
hip-hop to '70s funk to house to reggae to your overall soulful groove stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Choice of Music When You're Not Working: "I like everything, from hip-hop to 
house, Rage Against the Machine, jazz, soul." 
</P>
<P>
 Number of Records You Own: Between 5,000 and 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Do You Wear Earplugs?: "No, because I'm usually always in the booth, and 
usually the booths are behind the speakers." 
</P>
<P>
 Where Do You Go From Here?: "Right now I'm working on remixing -- that's the 
route I'm taking right now. I feel producing will come down the line."

<P>
 Sometimes I look at people and wonder if they are related to me. I do this in 
public places and private spaces. There I am, in airport terminals and train 
stations, on ballroom floors and sandy beaches, studying people who might be my 
relatives. At parties and dances I have become momentarily distracted by 
familiar yet unknown faces. I scrutinize the shape of the nose, the cast of the 
eyes, the curve of the lips and the jut of the chin. Whenever I see a tall 
white man with a slightly kinky golden brown hair, subtly flared nostrils and 
large ears of my brother, I say, "there's a Morris." 
</P>
<P>
 I am a black woman, but many of you would never know it. My skin is as light 
as that of an average white person. The skin of my sisters and brother is as 
light as, if not lighter than, mine. But we have lived as, worked as and mostly 
married black people. Our psyches, souls and sensibilities are black. Yet our 
lives have been deeply colored by our absence of deep color. 
</P>
<P>
 In a broader sense, my family's story reflects white and black America's 
historical attitude toward skin color. Our experience suggests that America is 
not what it presents itself to be. Some geneticists have said that 95% of 
"white" Americans have varying degrees of black heritage. According to "The 
Source: A Guidebook to American Genealogy," 75% of all African-Americans have 
at least one white ancestor and 15% have predominantly white blood lines. All 
statistics are subject to interpretation, but the fact that anthropologists and 
biologists continue to glean these truths from genetic data gives weight to the 
claim that there are no "real white Americans." I began the search for my 
mother's family believing that I was looking for black people "passing for 
white." And they did indeed pass. But what I ultimately found, I realized, were 
black people who had become white. After all, if you look white, act white, 
live white, vacation white, go to school white, marry white and die white, are 
you not "white?" 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, I have grown a great deal less certain about the vagaries of race 
and know that I am ambivalent about its implications. But I am comfortable with 
that ambivalence, for it keeps my doors and windows open.*

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; PHILIP HEYMANN; A VETERAN OF FIVE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENTS REFLECTS ON HIS BOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ronald J. Ostrow, Ronald J. Ostrow covers the Justice Department for The 
Times. He interviewed Philip B. Heymann in his temporary offices at Georgetown 
University Law Center. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Philip B. Heymann was sworn in as deputy attorney general last June in 
the Department of Justice, where he had served four previous attorneys general, 
he apologized "for looking so pleased," and said he had accepted Atty. Gen. 
Janet Reno's offer "with unseemly haste." 
</P>
<P>
 The comments were vintage Heymann: A puckish manner combined with a deep 
reverence for the institution of federal justice. Heymann's biography made him 
a textbook candidate for the second most powerful position at Justice: 12 years 
as a Harvard Law School professor and senior counsel to Common Cause; head of 
Justice's criminal division during the Carter Administration; an associate 
Watergate special prosecutor during summers off from teaching at Harvard; four 
years in the solicitor general's office through the Kennedy Administration and 
part of the Johnson Administration, and clerking for Supreme Court Justice John 
M. Harlan. 
</P>
<P>
 These impressive credentials contributed to the surprise at his resignation 
after only seven months as deputy -- a decision both he and Reno explained was 
necessary because of differences in style and chemistry. And then Heymann spent 
his first day out of government condemning the largely Administration-backed 
crime bill as doomed to failure in combatting violence and far too costly. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall, Heymann, 61, will be back at his tenured seat at Harvard, but 
first he goes to South Africa with Ann, his wife of 40 years. There he will 
work for Justice Richard Goldstone on a commission charged with holding down 
violence through South Africa's election at the end of April. It's not a new 
line of work. As director of Harvard's Center for Criminal Justice, Heymann 
managed projects to improve the systems of countries seeking to create or 
preserve democratic institutions -- helping Guatemala and Russia, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 Heymann's son, Stephen, is deputy chief of the criminal division in the U.S. 
attorney's office in Boston, and his daughter, Jody, is an assistant professor 
at Harvard Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in times of distress, like those following his resignation, Heymann can't 
keep his sense of humor in check. Asked what he would have done differently, he 
said he would have rented a house in Washington, not bought.* 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: With regard to your scathing criticism of the Senate-passed crime 
bill, isn't this a Democratic Party problem? The White House reelection 
advisers contend the President has to be tough on crime if he's going to be a 
New Democrat.  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Yes. Crime is one of the great political issues in most Western 
democracies. It generally breaks down along partisan lines. We're seeing a time 
when it's being handled in a nonpartisan way, with both parties competing to be 
as firm and tough on crime as they can be. I don't have any objection to that, 
but you can't be both the toughest and the smartest. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton said he wanted to be tough but smart. If you want to be 
decently smart and exercise some common sense, you can't be tougher than 
anybody who's competing for toughness. The toughest guy will say one strike, 
and you're out. Or the toughest guy will say, build 10 times more prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 So the difficult trick is how to be smart as well as tough in a political 
environment that rewards toughness more than smartness. The reason for that is 
it takes a little while to explain why one thing's smart and the other thing 
isn't. It doesn't take any time at all to explain why one thing's tougher than 
the next. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: With your service under four attor - neys general, you're in a position to 
evaluate what works and what doesn't. Would you compare their styles?  
</P>
<P>
 A: None of the attorneys general that I'm talking about would permit political 
considerations to enter into any prosecution or anything like that. I want to 
be very clear on that. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robert Kennedy was famous, at my time, for a meeting involving 
reapportionment when decisions were to be made as to the litigation of 
reapportionment. This would, obviously, have significant political effects on 
the Democratic Party. He refused to allow those to be considered, and insisted 
the discussion take place on a totally different plane -- constitutional (law). 
</P>
<P>
 He also was -- I was then in the solicitor general's office -- very respectful 
of the solicitor general. Until he could bring the solicitor general along, 
until they came to see reapportionment issues in the same way, he wouldn't 
move. He would not insist on one-person one-vote until he and (Solicitor 
General Archibald) Cox could both see their way clear. 
</P>
<P>
 So what I have a picture of is an attorney general who was inspiring in the 
sense of breathing life into the Department of Justice. Somewhat self-effacing, 
tough, very tough on crime -- especially organized crime. Also, of course -- 
and I think this is important -- very powerful with the President. He was very 
close to the President. It makes a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Let's move to Griffin Bell.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Bell was very concerned about espionage and intelligence matters -- created 
new institutions in that area. Put in effect an order which left me, as head of 
the criminal division, almost absolutely independent of any control by the 
deputy or the attorney general -- let alone anyone in the White House and the 
Congress. The rules that we now have put into effect for the Clinton 
Administration on contacts by the White House and the Congress were developed, 
in the first instance, I believe, under Griffin Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 He did something that went much further. He said that my decisions on 
prosecution or not prosecution could not be overruled by either him or the 
deputy without their giving a written explanation, and public if it was proper, 
of why they were overruling it. Very supportive of civil rights. Famously 
independent of the President, which requires the President to support that 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
 He respected the career service in a very real way. He protected the 
department against any desire that there might have been in the White House to 
interfere. I don't think there's ever been a White House that kept more of a 
distance from the Department of Justice than the Carter White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Civiletti was very much in that tradition. What struck me most about him 
is that he was deputy -- he had been head of the criminal division just before 
becoming deputy -- and from the moment he became deputy, he kept his hands off 
the criminal division. He left it to me. I was brand new. He knew where every 
problem was -- and yet he left it pretty much to me . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Let me switch to the present Administration. This attorney general is much, 
much more of a speaking public figure than Bell or Civiletti -- or almost any 
in between. 
</P>
<P>
 In a remarkable way, Janet Reno managed to change substantially the way people 
talk about violence by adding the prevention dimension. Never dropping the 
law-enforcement dimension, but adding prevention. It's been hard for her to 
hold that position or to put that into effect as the crime issue has become 
bigger and bigger -- and the competition between parties, and between everyone 
else, moves for tougher rather than smarter. 
</P>
<P>
 She has a different attitude toward the department than Griffin Bell's -- 
particularly toward career. Maybe she has a more traditional, somewhat 
skeptical kind of attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the attorneys general, only Civiletti probably knew the federal system and 
the federal structures very well at the start. Maybe Robert Kennedy did from 
his Senate years. They're still a little bit foreign to Atty. Gen. Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Reno comes in as, and in many ways continues to think like, the chief 
prosecutor of a major urban area. Obviously, noticeable, too, in an interesting 
way for the extent to which she cares about child development and believes in 
the importance of all the things that bring up children so they have a chance 
in life. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to do those things and influence those things from the Justice 
Department. It's extremely hard . . . . The big question is whether she and the 
people around her know that you need a very rich understanding of how federal 
institutions work to do this, and whether they have the capacity to generate 
programs that are effective out of visions that are inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've said the communications between the White House and the Justice 
Department now are too informal.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Basically, it largely has been working through (Associate Atty. Gen.) Web 
Hubbell. I like Web. I think he's very intelligent. I think he's very 
well-connected in the White House -- which he obviously is. 
</P>
<P>
 But it doesn't work to run criminal matters through the associate who has no 
responsibility on the criminal side, or FBI matters, or other things. It's like 
one team goes off the field and another team comes on the field in the middle 
of a play. A crime bill or the appointment of a DEA (Drug Enforcement 
Administration) administrator, or anything like that is a single course of 
events. The way we were doing it, when I would take it the long way down the 
field, and then when it came to making sure that the White House was agreed, it 
would shift into Web's hands. So on the same issue . . . there's no way that he 
could be nearly as familiar as I could be with it. And that shift was clumsy 
and harmful . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The other thing is, there was not a structure in the White House on the issue 
of crime. If you asked me who do you talk to, who should I talk to on crime 
issues, there was no way of knowing the answer, other than Bruce Reed, who's 
always there, but you didn't know whether it was the chief of staff, the deputy 
chief of staff, David Gergen, (George) Stephanopoulos, the White House counsel, 
the deputy White House counsel. It could be any of those people. There was no 
structure created. We had no structure on our side for dealing with the White 
House; they had no structure on their side for dealing with us; and Web was the 
substitute in both places. That made it a very ineffective and often 
demoralizing way of working. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Aren't problems that you described inevitable when you have a friend as 
close as Web Hubbell is to the President in the No. 3 spot?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No, it's not inevitable. There was this wonderful story that Robert Kennedy 
told. He came to the goodby party for Archibald Cox, who had been solicitor 
general, and told the following story: 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to tell you what it was like to be the President's brother. I had a 
red phone on my desk, and the phone would ring, and I'd pick it up and I'd say, 
'The attorney general speaking.' And on the other end of the line I'd hear, 
'Bobby?'  
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say, 'Yes, this is the attorney general, Mr. President.' And he would 
say, 'Bobby, I want to seize the steel mills and I have to know whether it's 
legal.' I would think for a minute and I would say, 'Mr. President, you can do 
it.' He would say, 'Bobby, ask Archie.' " 
</P>
<P>
 What the story reflects is -- and it was almost certainly apocryphal -- Robert 
Kennedy describing that the President wanted professional advice. I've 
described Griffin Bell wanting career advice. 
</P>
<P>
 It's inevitable that you continue to rely and value people you've known for a 
long time. But it's not inevitable that you don't come to also depend upon 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You were an associate Watergate special prosecutor for some years. It looks 
as if the independent counsel now will be back on the books. What changes would 
you like to see?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There's only one change that I'd like to see, and that's almost more a 
matter of practice. It's a terrible thing to be investigated. It really is. But 
what we get in exchange is we manage to get a government . . . that can go on 
and function even when there are accusations . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that could be done that I think would help immensely -- and I don't 
think it requires a change in the statute: Whenever something is referred to an 
independent counsel, the first thing an independent counsel ought to do is say 
if all the facts that were alleged were true, would I think this was a case for 
federal prosecution? Or do I think it's too trivial, too unimportant, for 
federal prosecution? 
</P>
<P>
 If the independent counsel would do that in the first two weeks, it would help 
a lot . . . . * 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This attorney general is much, much more of a speaking public figure than Bell 
or Civiletti -- or almost any in between. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Reno comes in as, and in many ways continues to think like, the chief 
prosecutor of a major urban area. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There was not a structure in the White House on the issue of crime. If you 
asked me, who should I talk to on crime issues? There was no way of knowing.

CANYON OAKS PROJECT SHOULD BE APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It is tragic that, after 15 years, the Canyon Oaks owners are still not 
permitted to build a legally conforming project on their privately owned land 
("Board Puts Off Call on Luxury Project," Feb. 10). 
</P>
<P>
 The further loss for us, as county citizens, is that this project would 
increase the tax revenue from this property from $100,000 to $2 million per 
year; millions more would be paid in school and other fees; thousands of work 
hours would be generated during construction, and about 250 permanent jobs 
would result. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Cockburn alleged in a Feb. 3 column that two supervisors were 
beholden to this project through campaign contributions. I hope Mr. Cockburn 
does not presume us ignorant of the political and monetary power wielded over 
certain politicians by various environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
 No one these days is naive enough to believe elections can be won without 
major contributors (e.g., Zev Yaroslavsky has reported amassing $700,000 from 
various interest groups -- including developers -- to run for county supervisor 
against an opponent whose only chance would be a victory by default). What 
matters is not who makes a contribution but whether it results in an official 
voting contrary to personal convictions and/or to the detriment of the 
constituency. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisors Deane Dana and Michael Antonovich consistently vote for any 
building project that complies with county laws and benefits the community. 
They encourage development because without it, we have plummeted into an 11% 
unemployment rate. Supervisors Yvonne Burke and Gloria Molina should remember 
that when the eastern and central portions of this county voted for Proposition 
A for "safer parks," they did not have in mind the confiscation of the Santa 
Monica Mountains and the rejection of employment opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Terry Friedman, proclaiming that Canyon Oaks should sacrifice its 
private property rights for the "common good," and Tom Hayden and his wilting 
"flower children" colleagues should look around. The San Fernando Valley is no 
longer a bed of roses! Failure to approve the Canyon Oaks project will be the 
kiss of death to attracting badly needed investors to this area in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The designer of Canyon Oaks has acted in good faith. He has satisfied all 
county and Santa Monica area plan requirements. He is proposing less density 
than surrounding residential communities. He has designed a golf course 
uniquely contoured around the natural topography. Canyon Oaks should be 
approved because it is good and because it complies with the law.

A BIGGER ROLE FOR NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Josh Meyer's excellent piece on the response of Neighborhood Watch groups to 
the Northridge earthquake underlined a key tool that has been ignored in the 
talk of rising crime and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago he wrote about the Ivar Hawks Neighborhood Watch in 
Hollywood, which made more than a dozen citizen's arrests of drug dealers in 
the process of turning our troubled central Hollywood community around. 
</P>
<P>
 In its Jan. 17 cover story, in fact, U. S. News and World Report cited the 
Ivar Hawks and another program as "the best hope for progress against violence" 
at the local level. 
</P>
<P>
 During the earthquake, the Hawks and other members of our Ivar Hill Community 
Response Team, trained by the Los Angeles Fire Department disaster preparedness 
division in a seven-week course two years ago, performed precisely as hoped, 
just as the valiant Northridge groups did. 
</P>
<P>
 West Valley Los Angeles Police Department Capt. Val Paniccia suggested that a 
special shed be provided to each group with the necessities of earthquake 
relief, and that's a terrific suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 But where is Neighborhood Watch in the annals of Mayor Riordan's Project 
Safety? Why not panelists or presenters on Neighborhood Watch at the governor's 
crime summit? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer may be that many people still believe Neighborhood Watch is a 
little old lady peeking out through her curtains. It is that and much, much 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 It deserves a very significant role in the fight against crime and disaster, 
and Josh Meyer's fine article may well help it find one.

COMMENT ABOUT HAYDEN WAS A CHEAP SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your political column suggests "a case of amnesia," because state Sen. Tom 
Hayden asked for some greening of a few miles of the Ventura Freeway (Feb. 11). 
I think this is a cheap shot. 
</P>
<P>
 You distract from the valid point that Sen. Hayden is making, that the current 
administration mismanaged by spending too little on earthquake retrofitting, 
not that too much was spent on freeway landscaping.

LET'S NOT ALLOW PARKING STRUCTURES TO FAIL TWICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * How is it that we can send people to the moon but we can't seem to design a 
safe parking lot? Going to our favorite mall used to be fun. Now we wonder if 
we can get out alive before the parking structure comes crashing down on our 
heads. 
</P>
<P>
 We're in this spot because our structural design standards appear to favor 
cost rather than safety. Maybe we need to consider the people aspect and go 
back to first design principles. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the seismic results quoted in recent Times news articles indicated, 
among other things, that the earth moved back and forth several inches during 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Assume that the earth moves back and forth about three inches and that this 
shaking occurs at about two times a second. The resultant side force applied to 
a typical building would be more than the weight of the whole building! That's 
a pretty high load, and even the proverbial brick outhouse would have trouble 
standing up to it. I seriously doubt that present-day parking structures have 
anywhere near this strength capability. And so they fall down, smashing 
everything and every person inside. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be tragic to ignore such dire effects when new parking structures are 
approved by the Building and Safety Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's not allow our parking structures to fail twice. They might be full of 
people next time.

IMPROPER PRUNING OF TREES IS SHOCKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am constantly shocked, appalled and amazed at the care of trees in Los 
Angeles and the Conejo Valley area. I am shocked at the way these trees look 
after they have been "topped," that is, trimmed so drastically that little is 
left of the branches and leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 I am amazed to see no reason for this (i.e., overhead wires or other trees), 
and appalled that this horrendous practice is done by people calling themselves 
tree-care professionals. I have also seen this despicable practice on street 
trees. Cities and towns should have at the very least a forester if not an 
arborist to oversee the care of these valuable assets. 
</P>
<P>
 I am an arboriculture student in my senior year at the University of 
Massachusetts. I have also practiced proper tree care for 12-plus years as a 
professional. Topping is detrimental to the tree in every respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Without trees there would be no life. We need trees. Trees do not need us. 
Proper pruning of trees enhances structural soundness, safety and aesthetic 
value. For these detrimental practices to continue in this day and age of town 
foresters, oak tree consultants and experienced arborists is utter lunacy. 
</P>
<P>
 When a tree is topped, the problems only begin. First, the leaves are being 
removed, by a third or more in particularly heinous cases. The leaves absorb 
sunlight which the tree needs to thrive and survive. And the trees have an open 
wound that may let damaging insects in and weaken the structure of the tree 
when and if it grows back. 
</P>
<P>
 Properly maintained, healthy trees can raise the value of a property by 25%. 
Just say no to tree topping.

ANGRY RESIDENTS NOT TAKING IT ANYMORE; CITIZEN INVOLVEMENT IS WELCOME, BUT 
THERE ARE LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 20 years ago, Neighborhood Watch groups here and elsewhere were 
relatively scattered and isolated. Such groups had already become something of 
a symbol, however, of the ability of people to organize, take action and fight 
back against crime. Perhaps even more importantly, Neighborhood Watch efforts 
had begun to restore a sense of community in those areas where residents might 
have previously been strangers to each other. Those acts were born of 
frustration and necessity; suspicious characters were simply less discernible 
when residents did not even know who their neighbors were. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, all manner of groups have surfaced to act as extended sets of eyes 
and ears for local police. No longer do members merely keep a wary eye on the 
field of vision from their bedroom or living room windows. These days, the most 
ambitious, inspired, and organized communities (or those most fed up with 
crime) have civilians walk the streets of their neighborhoods or patrol in cars 
with cellular phones and two-way radios, cameras and camcorders. Some are 
better equipped, in that respect, than the Los Angeles Police Department. The 
best of these groups realize that their role is to report crime and suspicious 
activities, not to take the law into their own hands. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been many variations on this theme. Some groups specifically target 
graffiti vandals, carefully logging who uses what "tag," and the location of 
their costly spray-paint mischief. Arson watch groups are on the lookout for 
fires and those who might set them. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only logical that such groups in the west San Fernando Valley were 
better organized, better equipped, and able to respond most quickly to last 
month's earthquake. And it was only a matter of time before someone came up 
with the eminently sensible idea of tapping that resource now, to train them to 
help authorities and successfully weather the next natural disaster to strike 
Los Angeles. The LAPD and Valley elected officials such as City Council members 
Hal Bernson and Laura Chick want to do exactly that. But it would be wrong, and 
perhaps a mistake, to place too heavy a burden on citizens who must ultimately 
depend on the authorities to maintain social order. And there is a limit to the 
sophistication they will be able to maintain. Certainly, trained citizens can 
be quite useful when they know how to check for gas leaks and other problems, 
by knowing which neighbors are likely to be in need of the most assistance, and 
by directing police and fire department crews to trouble spots as they arrive 
on the scene. Citizens groups, however, will never supplant well-trained, 
full-fledged emergency preparedness teams, nor should they be expected to on 
even a limited basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, it would be relatively easy to inspire such civic interest in those 
areas where civilians are already motivated. What about those neighborhoods 
where such inspiration -- if not courage -- is lacking? Many of us have heard 
of neighborhoods that are under such siege by crime, for example, that those 
who live there are too frightened and intimidated to even report crimes to the 
police. People in such circumstances might also lack the cohesiveness to pull 
together in a natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps there is a way to reverse the process here. It's one thing for a 
neighborhood to be bludgeoned into submission by unrelenting crime. It might be 
easier for such communities to rally together against a less vengeful foe, such 
as the next earthquake, and to achieve the kind of preparations that will be 
needed to lessen its blow. 
</P>
<P>
 Once such a nucleus of community organization and spirit is created, perhaps 
the local authorities will find those same folks newly emboldened in terms of 
crime and the need to help police fight another battle.

WHY SHOULD MORTGAGE FIRMS ESCAPE THE PAIN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The story "Middle Class Between a Rock and a Hard Place" (Feb. 7) obviously 
touched a raw nerve, for it seemed to go through the Valley like a sonic boom. 
It popped up in the conversation of literally every person I encountered that 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 I too am angered, but I am not angry at the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, nor am I angry at the government. I am angry in being placed in a 
position in which I must ask other middle-class citizens, who just like myself 
are struggling to make ends meet, to take on yet another burden in extending 
help to me. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's face it folks, when we run to FEMA for aid, we are running to ourselves 
and paying twice for the pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA is taxpayer dollars. Small Business Administration loans are taxpayer 
dollars. We will pay for these loans and grants both as givers and receivers. 
How many of us are really in a position to take on any more personal debt to 
repair our properties? How many of us feel we can collectively increase our tax 
burdens? 
</P>
<P>
 In this picture, I am beginning to wonder why our business partners, those 
holders of our mortgages who are the true "homeowners," should face this "act 
of God" unscathed? Why are the home dwellers facing the burden alone? Mortgage 
holders are, after all, businesses. These institutions know all business has 
some inherent risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the time has come for us to unite and collectively tell our business 
partners that their greed is showing and it is time for them to assume some of 
the collective loss.  
</P>
<P>
 I am not calling for anything but a reasonable and workable solution. Perhaps 
a three-month waiver of interest (not principal) might be a universally 
acceptable formula. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not claim to have the solution, but I feel strongly that lending 
institutions must become participants in solving the problem.

SHEDDING LIGHT ON THE GANG PROBLEM; BULLET-RESISTANT STREET-LAMP SHIELDS ROB 
CRIMINALS OF THEIR CLOAK OF DARKNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A street light that has been put out of commission by gunshots or other means 
may have been the target of a simple act of vandalism. In another respect, 
however, the stretch of darkness that results can be a sign that an important 
public place is no longer under public control. If the street-light busters can 
operate with impunity and if a cash-strapped local government can't keep up, 
then gang members and muggers may feel as though they can attack people on that 
street with equal impunity. 
</P>
<P>
 The criminals are emboldened; the law-abiding citizenry is left with less 
confidence. As Jean Green, the Los Angeles Police Department's senior lead 
officer for the Blythe Street area in Panorama City puts it: "The darker the 
street, the more crime that can occur on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of thinking is part of the essence of community-based policing, a 
concept we have long supported. In it, police work in concert with other 
municipal agencies to correct the problems that help crime flourish. The city's 
Bureau of Street Lighting has come up with such a problem-solver: a 
street-light shield that is impenetrable to most bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been tested on about a dozen street lights throughout Los Angeles. As 
Times reporter Hugo Martin wrote recently, the results, so far, have been 
glowing. As Green suggests, the street-light cover that has been tested on 
Blythe Street has lasted for weeks and has discouraged crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The shield will save the city money on repairs because it costs $130 per 
light, while the price tag for replacing shot-out lights can go as high as 
$500. But there is another way to consider the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Blythe Street has been the site of some of the city's costliest crime-fighting 
initiatives, such as a labor-intensive ban on gang activity in which police 
must scour the streets for suspects. The gang in question has done much to 
alter the neighborhood to suit its own needs, such as installing lookouts on 
rooftops and fashioning escape routes through yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say light shields have been installed only on lamps that have been 
shot out five or six times. But ensuring that the lights are always on on 
Blythe Street, so to speak, and similarly afflicted neighborhoods would be one 
way to fight back. 
</P>
<P>
 It would make police work a bit easier. Law-abiding citizens would be better 
able to observe and report crimes. Better yet, it would be a sign that the 
public and the authorities, not the criminals, control the streets.

METROLINK MUST RE-EMPHASIZE SAFETY; TRAIN SERVICE EXPANDS AFTER QUAKE, BUT OLD 
DANGERS REMAIN FOR DRIVERS AND PEDESTRIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The earthquake-inspired effort to rush more Metrolink commuter train lines and 
stations into service is a vitally important step that might help the Los 
Angeles County transportation system become far more versatile and efficient. 
But with new and more frequent service rolling out of Lancaster, Palmdale, 
Santa Clarita, Canyon Country, Sylmar and other locations, it is equally 
important to remember that the public must be reacquainted and educated about 
the easily avoidable dangers trains present to motorists and pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 The dangers should be obvious, but the frequency of carnage and death along 
the Metrolink lines suggests otherwise, particularly in the San Fernando 
Valley. In North Hollywood in December, a teen-age boy was struck and killed by 
a Metrolink train as he walked along the tracks while listening to music on a 
headset. In Sunland earlier this month, a boy on his bicycle ignored a train's 
warning signals, rode around lowered crossing gates and was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 That last fatality occurred eight miles south of a stretch of track where four 
lives were lost in only an eight-month period. We note here also that 
statistics from the national nonprofit public education program called 
Operation Lifesaver show California with the nation's highest percentage of 
motorist crashes at railroad crossings with active warning devices -- exactly 
the type of crossing that ought to be accident-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of such statistics, it is incumbent upon Metrolink officials to 
conduct the same kind of public information campaigns that it has in the past 
in response to high numbers of citations and accidents. A certain amount of 
common sense on the part of citizens is also in order. 
</P>
<P>
 It simply never makes sense for a motorist, for example, to attempt to beat a 
Metrolink train to a crossing. These are quick, short trains and the delays 
created by their passage are minimal at most. Pedestrians also need to remember 
that a train traveling at just 59 m.p.h. will cover 100 yards in less than 3 
1/2 seconds. A railroad track is one of the last places where caution and 
attentiveness should be cast to the wind.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES ARE ADRIFT IN A SEA OF BUREAUCRACY; 
SIGNIFICANT ECOLOGICAL AREAS HAVE DECLINED IN QUALITY BECAUSE OFFICIALDOM CAN'T 
OR WON'T ACT. COURT ACTION MAY BE THE ONLY WAY TO RESCUE THESE OPEN-SPACE 
PRESERVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDY WOHLGEMUTH, Sandy Wohlgemuth of Reseda is conservation chairman of the 
Los Angeles Audubon Society. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If a poll taker asked for a definition of the acronym SEA, most people would 
have no idea. Yet Significant Ecological Areas are important if one believes 
that Southern California is well on its way to becoming wall-to-wall housing 
tracts and commercial zones. 
</P>
<P>
 SEAs are designated by Los Angeles County as open spaces of special value for 
native plants and wildlife that must be preserved from inappropriate 
development. They were included in the county's General Plan in 1980, five 
years after a lawsuit alleging a lack of open-space protection in the plan 
forced the Board of Supervisors to rewrite it. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the excellent SEAs are Tujunga Wash, Santa Susana Pass, Chatsworth 
Reservoir and the Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounded wonderful, containing a commitment "to preserve the county's 
ecological resources and habitat areas in as viable a natural condition as 
possible." Those of us with affection for canyons, wetlands and woodlands took 
heart. Alas, we were soon disenchanted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The board was controlled by a conservative majority -- Michael Antonovich, 
Deane Dana and Pete Schabarum -- that never met a developer it didn't like. 
They were unable to get rid of SEAs, but they were not obligated to make them 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 SEAs are almost all in private hands. Under the General Plan, homes may be 
built "at densities compatible with the resource values present." Who decides 
what's a compatible density? A technical advisory committee of volunteer 
biologists, called SEATAC, was set up to make this judgment. But it was given 
no real power. It can only advise and suggest. The Planning Commission and the 
Board of Supervisors make all the decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Over time, SEAs have gradually declined in quality. With increased population 
and the disappearance of land suitable for homes close to jobs, developers have 
reached out to more distant locations, which is where the SEAs are. Permits to 
build were generously issued until some of the SEAs were so exploited that they 
lost the values that made them significant. SEATAC cannot monitor the condition 
of the 61 SEAs because the county refused to pay for a study. The county can 
protect an SEA by buying it, but the supervisors have successfully resisted the 
temptation. Although federal and state agencies have sought to acquire SEAs -- 
and had the funds -- they received no encouragement or cooperation from the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 What can be done to stop the eventual destruction of SEAs? A tough question. 
Electing a Board of Supervisors that gives a damn would help. Changing the 
General Plan to further restrict development in SEAs might make a difference. 
Buying them outright would solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 At this time the answer must be: None of the above. What about the courts? 
Several lawsuits have been filed recently, and that may indicate a way out. A 
strong challenge to the inadequate SEA system is called for, a test case that 
will establish genuine protection for natural habitats. 
</P>
<P>
 One is in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As you approach Magic Mountain going north on Interstate 5 from Los Angeles, 
you pass a marvelous stretch of undisturbed valley oaks. These elegant trees 
with their wide sweeping branches are surrounded by grassland that rises gently 
to form low, sensuous hills. Because this habitat is so scarce, 300 acres was 
designated SEA 64, Valley Oaks Savannah. There are about 1,200 oaks in the SEA, 
one of the last two remaining oak savannahs in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 What many people were dreading finally came to pass. A project was proposed 
for almost 2,000 homes and a golf course for 200 acres of the SEA. SEATAC, the 
California Parks Department and even the staff of the county Planning 
Department opposed the project. But the Planning Commission and the supervisors 
approved it anyway. Environmentalists sued, charging inconsistencies with the 
General Plan and violation of the California Environmental Quality Act. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1993, the court agreed that the project would generate excessive air 
pollution and overtax school and library facilities. Unfortunately, the judge 
did not rule on the most important issue: the county's refusal to adhere to its 
own General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was appealed. A favorable decision would establish the precedent that 
the county must honor the spirit of the General Plan. A victory would mean the 
potential rescue of all SEAs from their inevitable oblivion. Unhappily, a 
procedural error by the plaintiffs threw the case out and the opportunity was 
missed. Bad luck, but not the end of the world. Another lawsuit is in the 
making for SEA 64.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; LET'S NOT STALL; A COMPUTER-AIDED '90S VERSION OF 
HITCHHIKING CAN BE A RELIABLE, SAFE WAY OF MAKING ROADS LESS CONGESTED. THE 
SYSTEM WORKS WELL IN GERMANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SONDERS, Scott Sonders is a free-lance writer who lives in Tarzana.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Earthquakes are here to stay. Traffic will be delivering aftershocks for a 
long time to come. The pols insist that solutions to our car problems will be 
costly and difficult. But here's one that's cheap and easy. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a form of hitchhiking based on a system used in Germany. It's a little 
more complicated and a lot safer than sticking out your thumb or picking up 
riders. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitfahrerzentrale is a central ride-sharing agency that, with a simple phone 
call, connects a driver traveling somewhere with an empty seat to a passenger 
going in the same direction. It's hitchhiking computerized and made safe. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent business trip, I was impressed that Berliners, Hamburgers and 
residents of most major cities have the system, with a toll-free 24-hour phone 
number that hooks up riders with drivers on relatively short notice. The plan 
is well-used, especially among students and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 The number is in telephone directories, on billboards near bus and subway 
stops and in tourist publications. It works! Similar agencies exist in other 
European cities and England, where an outfit called Freewheelers has a system 
that includes photo IDs and extensive intercity trip-sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 We have something vaguely similar called the Commuter Computer, operated since 
1974 by Commuter Transportation Services. But it connects only commuters 
regularly going to the same location. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitchhiking was once widespread. However, thumbing a ride has declined in 
ratio to the increase of urban violence. Although I hitchhiked through my 
university years, I wouldn't chance it now. Some of the people inhabiting our 
roadsides might as well carry signs threatening, " Don't give me a ride, or 
else!" 
</P>
<P>
 But risk can be reduced, if not eliminated. A safe plan can be created for 
Valley residents. 
</P>
<P>
 We would need an agency with access to police and Department of Motor Vehicles 
files. It would issue "hitchhiking licenses" to riders and drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants would be required to pass a police-type inspection to eliminate 
those with aberrant or criminal backgrounds. Those qualified would be issued 
waterproof licenses prominently displaying their photographs, fingerprints, 
physical descriptions and a permit number. The licenses should be large enough 
to see from several feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 Driver and hitchhiker would then regard one another and their corresponding 
licenses from a secure distance, before offering or accepting a ride. A woman 
could decide to travel only with another woman, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitchhiking pickup spots could be established at bus stops and freeway 
on-ramps. This would allow quick, safe entry and exit for passengers, requiring 
no tax dollars for new construction. Participants could go anywhere with 
greater speed, ease and comfort. It would be easier than driving solo, planning 
difficult ride-shares or waiting for the public transport. 
</P>
<P>
 One can imagine incentives to encourage safe hitching. One idea: coupon books 
good for 10 rides that a rider would buy for $5, or 50 cents per ride. The 
driver could collect the coupons and redeem each stamp received for a 40-cent 
discount on a gasoline purchase. The 10-cent difference might be split between 
the service station operator and the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Byproducts could be increased social interaction and community friendliness, 
as former strangers exchange rides and conversation, and become acquainted. 
People that share are people that succeed. And that holds true for those torn 
by stress, or earthquakes.  
</P>
<P>
 Without new taxes, this plan would give communities a way to reduce air 
pollution, traffic congestion and petroleum consumption. And that, in turn, 
would bolster our quake-ridden economy.

<P>
 Planning to catch up on your rest this weekend? Or do you insist (yawn!) that 
you have better things to do than sleep? 
</P>
<P>
 You're in good company: 
</P>
<P>
 * Napoleon had a reputation for getting by only a few hours of sleep a night, 
especially while waging one of his many wars to conquer Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 * President Kennedy would work in the Oval Office until 2 or 3 a.m. and rise 
at 7:30, with daily one-hour naps. 
</P>
<P>
 * President Clinton tries to get by on five hours and a nap, but he says he 
knows his limit is about 12 hours of work a day. 
</P>
<P>
 * Winston Churchill slept little and sometimes ridiculed those who slept more. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, kept up the tradition. 
She sleeps three to four hours a night. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Today" show anchor Bryant Gumbel, who has to be up and out by 4 a.m., is 
able to stay up late without feeling tired on the set. "I'm lucky," he says. "I 
only need four hours of sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 * The artist Salvador Dali felt the same way. When overtired, he used to sit 
holding a spoon over a tin plate on the floor. When he fell asleep, he'd drop 
the spoon, waking himself up, claiming to be completely refreshed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Leonardo da Vinci decided to sleep 15 minutes every four hours, a total of 
an hour and a half each day. After five months he gave up -- reporting that he 
felt all tingly around the head and was biting his tongue frequently -- and 
went back to his regular four hours.

SONG OF SOUTH-CENTRAL; IN NOVEL 'UNDERSTAND THIS,' COMPLETED AT UCI, TERVALON 
GIVES AN ELOQUENT, GRITTY VOICE TO BLACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Growing up in South-Central Los Angeles in the '70s, Jervey Tervalon managed 
to avoid getting caught up in the burgeoning gang lifestyle. When outside gang 
members would scale the fence at notoriously tough Foshay Junior High School 
like a band of marauders, he and a friend would hide in the gym-ball box. In 
high school, he and his college-bound friends were interested in girls and 
grades, not gangs and guns. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tervalon couldn't escape the sometimes-tragic fallout of gangs a decade 
later when he was teaching English at Locke High School, a South-Central L.A. 
outpost fellow teachers wryly referred to as the "foreign legion." 
</P>
<P>
 One of his students -- "the last kid in the world who would be disrespectful" 
-- was shot to death in a phone booth after basketball practice, a case of 
mistaken identity. Another student suffered a nervous breakdown after a cousin 
was gunned down during a dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was another impressive young man: polite, hard-working, a good student -- 
the kind of guy that if you had him for a son you'd be happy," said Tervalon, 
35. "When I saw him starting to crack up, displaying odd behavior that was just 
totally unusual for him -- crying and laughing, causing scenes -- I wondered, 
'What the hell is going on? It's like a war out there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And like post-traumatic stress disorder in returning war veterans, Tervalon 
realized, "You're seeing this in kids. Young people are shattered. And these 
are not your kids who are considered losers. These are kids coming to school, 
getting good grades." 
</P>
<P>
 Galvanized by the experience, Tervalon, who had been writing short stories 
since high school, began writing a novel about the life-and-death struggles of 
young blacks coming of age in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Understand This" (Morrow; $20), which Tervalon completed while in the UC 
Irvine graduate Program in Writing and was published this month, is a gritty 
tale that delves below the surface of "news at 11" crime footage to show the 
emotional aftershocks a senseless killing has on surviving friends and 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Told from eight points of view in alternating chapters that crackle with 
street argot, the novel opens with high school senior Francois Williams 
witnessing his best friend Doug being shot and killed by Doug's drug-addict 
girlfriend only minutes after the two youths had been throwing a football in 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "A little burst of white from the car, another one, Doug rolls away, flips on 
his back. Rika tears out, runs a stop sign and poofs. I get there before I know 
what I'm gonna do. . . . "  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Francois is numbed by his friend's death, his no-nonsense girlfriend 
Margot dismisses his "crying over some . . . woman beater, some wanna-be high 
roller, some fool that never (cared) about anybody but himself."  
</P>
<P>
 Spirited and unfailingly forthright, Margot has her eye set on going to UC 
Santa Cruz, while the shattered Francois walks the fine line between what's 
legal and what's not. 
</P>
<P>
 Six supporting characters, including Francois' mother and the dead boy's 
brother, sister and girlfriend, move the narrative forward with their own 
chapters to create what Publishers Weekly calls "a dizzying mosaic of struggle 
and despair, promise and hopelessness." 
</P>
<P>
 There's even a teacher, Michaels, who resembles Tervalon at the end of his 
five-year stint at Locke in the late '80s when he was verging on burnout yet 
felt reluctant to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 Tervalon, a Pasadena resident who teaches a weekly literature class and a 
literary symposium at UC Santa Barbara, calls "Understand This" a novel of 
"voices and perspectives that portray a patchwork reality" that shows "the 
complexities of society in black Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was impressed by Tolstoy's encyclopedic vision of 19th-Century Russia, and 
somehow I hoped to be able to create a novel that would share that kind of 
dynamic, but in the oral traditions that I had grown up with: creating a spoken 
novel that would reveal the internal lives of these various characters that I 
knew and that I had grown up with. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to see them represented in their complexity instead of seeing them 
reduced to a sociological analysis; I wanted to see their flesh and blood, and 
I found out I could accomplish this by having them 'speak' themselves into 
existence." 
</P>
<P>
 The youngest of four brothers, Tervalon moved to Los Angeles from New Orleans 
when he was 4. Home was in a predominantly black "working class to middle 
class" neighborhood where, he said, "there was a real sense of community." 
</P>
<P>
 Although his parents -- his father worked for the post office, his mother was 
a key-punch operator -- divorced when he was 10, Tervalon said they were always 
there for him: "My father and mother were avid readers, and they encouraged me 
to go to college." 
</P>
<P>
 At Dorsey High School in the mid-'70s, Tervalon was an honors student who took 
advantage of opportunities -- from photography classes to flying lessons given 
through the aviation club. There also were creative writing classes in which he 
wrote poems about love and death, as well as horror and kung fu stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very stimulating world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a teen-ager, Tervalon and his friends didn't just hang around the 
neighborhood. They'd go to the beach and Griffith Park, catch the bus to 
Hollywood to "stare at the crazies" and go to the downtown museums with their 
girlfriends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles wasn't a claustrophobic closet like it is today for a lot of 
kids," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To join or not join a gang "wasn't really a choice I had to make. I basically 
had strong interests, and I tried to follow them up." 
</P>
<P>
 As a literature major at UC Santa Barbara, Tervalon continued to take creative 
writing classes. After graduating in 1980, he returned to South-Central Los 
Angeles to teach English at Locke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to teach at an inner-city high school," he said. "I was just 
primarily interested in teaching literature to the students because reading was 
so important to me. I thought maybe I could make a difference in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 The experience also changed his life. 
</P>
<P>
 In deciding to write a novel about young people growing up in South-Central, 
Tervalon combined his feelings over the death of one of his favorite students 
with the memory of a striking image that had haunted him since his high school 
days: A friend had told him about seeing another boy shot in the face by his 
girlfriend after slapping her in an argument in the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I began wondering what would be the reaction of a kid -- the kind of internal 
dialogue, the psychic repercussions -- of witnessing something like that," 
Tervalon said. "I think one thing that's neglected in these discussions about 
what it's like to grow up in these inner cities is that these children are not 
adults, they're not monsters, they're not soldiers or supermen or superwomen. 
They're people.  
</P>
<P>
 "We rarely talk about the internal psychology of these kids. We kind of ignore 
it and think only of the external. Sometimes there's fear and depression, but 
you don't see it. You just see the veneer of a kid that's unscarred, but inside 
they're suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 Encouraged by his wife, Gina, a personnel analyst for the city of Los Angeles, 
Tervalon applied to UC Irvine's nationally acclaimed graduate Program in 
Writing. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he started attending the weekly writing workshop, however, 
Tervalon had abandoned "a really bad first draft" of his South-Central novel 
and was writing a novel about his family in New Orleans.  
</P>
<P>
 But in reading his work-in-progress to the dozen other workshop members, 
Tervalon -- the only black in the group -- found his dialogue being criticized. 
</P>
<P>
 A "well-meaning friend" who told him his characters "don't talk like black 
people" gave him a copy of a novel that contained what he considered 
stereotypical "Song of the South"-style Southern dialogue.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think she thought she was doing a service," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus motivated to write a novel with characters who talk like the people he 
knows, Tervalon dropped his family saga and began rewriting his South-Central 
novel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided to write something so much in the vernacular, so dense with 
dialect, that if the readers weren't from that community they would sometimes 
be at a loss," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When he began reading passages of the new novel in the workshop, he said, 
"They didn't understand a lot of the dialogue, but they liked it. And I liked 
that reaction: They were sort of intimidated by it, so I continued to write at 
a pretty quick pace." 
</P>
<P>
 Tervalon views UCI's writing program as invaluable in providing an 
"enlightened" audience for his writing. "It also provided time and the 
opportunity to write, and I got to meet people who really championed my work 
like (writing teachers) Oakley Hall and Thomas Keneally," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was through the now-retired Hall, founder of the Squaw Valley Writers 
Community -- an annual writers conference -- that Tervalon's manuscript was 
given to an agent, who sold the book within three weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 "I felt very fortunate," said Tervalon. "I had people telling me ever since 
1978 that 'Things will work out -- you'll make some money; you'll establish 
yourself as a writer.' I'm glad I wasn't impatient. I knew it would be a 
long-term process; I'd have to just carry on with a stiff upper lip with my 
chin forward and just march on." 
</P>
<P>
 Tervalon, who recently completed a one-year screenwriting fellowship at 
Disney's Hollywood Pictures division, is continuing to march on. 
</P>
<P>
 He has completed a second novel -- "a fictional family history of black L.A. 
over the last 30 years" -- that's in the hands of his agent. And he's well into 
a third novel, this one about the black community in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd just like to put together a body of work that really explores the 
material of black life toward the end of the 20th Century," he said. "I just 
hope I can really utilize the material like Faulkner did -- take the problems 
and complexities of a small community and make them timeless and universal."

VIOLENCE ON SCHOOL CAMPUS ELUDES SOLUTIONS; SAFETY: STUDENTS ARE REMINDED OF 
THE THREAT DAILY. OFFICIALS AND POLITICIANS ADDRESS THE ISSUE, BUT 'WITHOUT 
MONEY, IT'S A TOUGH ONE,' L.A. SUPERINTENDENT SAYS.

 The memory of rushing her son off to school last Feb. 22 still haunts Margaret 
Ensley. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so slow, he just moved so slowly," she recalled. "I kept after him: 
'Hurry up, you'll miss the school bus.' . . . I hurried him to his death." 
</P>
<P>
 At 10:10 that morning, Michael Ensley was shot dead during a snack break at 
Reseda High School -- the second Los Angeles Unified School District student to 
die from campus gunfire in a month. One year later, the tragedy haunts his 
mother as well as school officials struggling to reduce campus violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The school system has expelled a record number of students for bringing guns 
and knives on campus and has begun using metal detectors to search students for 
weapons. But students continue to bring weapons to school in large numbers. 
Supt. Sid Thompson acknowledges that school officials remain unable to ensure 
the safety of the district's 640,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't do anything that's absolutely going to guarantee the safety of kids," 
Thompson said in an interview. "If I had a magic wand, I'd get additional 
funding for more police officers. I'd put 300 additional campus aides to assist 
in supervision on our campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without money, it's a tough one," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the year since Ensley died, school violence has become a hot political 
topic. Both Gov. Pete Wilson's crime summit and Assembly Speaker Willie Brown's 
education summit had panels on the subject. Two mothers of students killed on 
campuses -- including Margaret Ensley -- have formed a group to keep the issue 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On campus, students are reminded of the threat of school violence by the metal 
detectors used at every high school and middle school and signs proclaiming 
that bringing a gun to school can get you expelled -- and advertising a phone 
number for students to turn in their classmates. Teachers, for the first time, 
are being told when violent students are transferred to their classrooms. And 
principals have been directed to keep campuses secure and gates locked. 
</P>
<P>
 Students say there is a climate of fear on some campuses and that they are 
reminded of the problem continuously. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone worries about it," said Glenn Browne Jr., who was shot and 
critically wounded at Dorsey High in September and has transferred to a new 
campus. "I know I do and my friends all do." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem has escalated so high that many students believe they must arm 
themselves for protection and there is little shock at seeing a weapon on 
campus, said school district police chief Wes Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has become an informal social norm that kids need to protect themselves, 
so why not carry the tools to protect themselves?" said Mitchell, who added 
that the district should provide more education about guns and violence. "There 
are no short-term solutions to this problem. The only real solution is to 
change attitudes. In our society, it's as normal to shoot someone now as it was 
to punch someone 10 years ago. When is this going to change in our kids?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Education toughened its expulsion policy after last year's 
shootings and has kicked out a record number of students for bringing weapons 
to school. In the 1992-93 school year, the board expelled 241 students compared 
to 95 the previous year, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 But expulsion records also suggest that the number of students bringing 
weapons to school has not dropped. In the 1992-93 school year, 592 students 
were recommended for expulsion for weapons compared to 504 the previous year. 
Some students were sent to alternative schools or were not expelled for a 
variety of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting incidents last year struck campuses across the district. Because 
the cases were not isolated in one section of the city, parents and students 
throughout the system were forced to confront the problem. Ironically, two of 
the shooting victims were attending schools they believed were safer than 
campuses in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ensley was bused to Reseda from his home in South-Central Los Angeles because 
his mother believed the school was safe. She said she would have done anything 
to give her son a secure school atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't like he was out robbing someone," Margaret Ensley said. "The law 
says I have to send my son to school. So I sent him to a school I thought was 
safe. It wasn't like he was in the wrong place." 
</P>
<P>
 Ensley was shot by a 15-year-old classmate, Robert Heard, who ran sobbing 
across the campus and was arrested in a nearby doughnut shop. Heard is awaiting 
trial on murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Ensley's violent death came a month after another fatal shooting on a Los 
Angeles campus. Demetrius Rice, a 16-year-old student at Fairfax High, was shot 
to death by a classmate who accidentally fired a .357 magnum during an English 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 Since those incidents, a student was wounded at Dorsey High while waiting in a 
registration line on the first day of school in September. Another student was 
critically injured at Chatsworth High while waiting for his mother to pick him 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 Ensley and the father of the Dorsey student sued the district in the past 
week, charging that the schools failed to provide adequate safety and 
supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Browne Sr., whose son was shot Sept. 7, said the district should have 
provided more supervision and never should have allowed outsiders on the 
campus. His son was shot by an 18-year-old gang member who was looking for 
someone else, officials said. Bryant Boyd has been arraigned and is awaiting 
trial on attempted murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something like this should have never happened," Browne said. "When I send my 
kids to school, I expect them to be safe. I enrolled them at Dorsey for a 
reason." 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Browne Jr. lost a kidney and will never again participate in sports. His 
younger brother, Deon, was at his side when the shooting occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm scared -- I'm still scared," said Glenn Jr. "I'm scared that they will 
come back and get me. I think about my body (and) how messed up I am. I can't 
play football or any sports at all. I can't really do nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, 17-year-old Gabriel Gettleson was shot at Chatsworth High when 
he refused to give his backpack to two boys. Gettleson was waiting for his 
mother to pick him up and take him to his job. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After weeks in the intensive care unit at Northridge Hospital Medical Center, 
the Gettleson family moved from Northridge to an undisclosed location, school 
officials said. "After the earthquake, it was too much and they moved," said 
Donna Smith, principal at Chatsworth High. 
</P>
<P>
 The shootings at Fairfax and Reseda brought two mothers together to fight for 
school safety. Mildred Hillard, whose son Demetrius Rice was killed at Fairfax 
on Jan. 21, 1993, formed Mothers Against Violence in Schools with Ensley. They 
have appeared on panels, met with politicians and say they will never let their 
children be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a year and we're just now talking about protecting our children," 
Hillard said. "How many more children are going to die? How many more lives 
will it take before they start acting faster?" 
</P>
<P>
 The district spends $25 million of its $3.9-billion budget on its police force 
and Thompson said he will not spend more. "I could have bought a lot of books 
with that," he said. "I'm just not willing to cut jobs from one place to add to 
another." 
</P>
<P>
 School crime reports show that district police took 774 reports of 
weapons-related incidents in 1993 and 895 reports in 1992. The school police 
recovered 127 guns in 1993 and 168 guns in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's metal detector program, which randomly screens about 25 
students per day at each high school and middle school, has failed to turn up 
any weapons. An anonymous tip hot line received about 20 calls a day at its 
height last fall but dropped to about three by December. Almost none have come 
in since the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has made some cosmetic changes: Police cars are being painted 
white with a bright blue "police" logo and officers now are in uniform on 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A task force created by school board member Mark Slavkin in the wake of a rash 
of school violence came up with some new safety measures but anything that 
costs money has been tabled. The panel proposed training teachers and other 
school staff members in gang prevention methods and using school psychologists 
to intervene with problem students. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said he has been studying the recommendations and plans to announce 
his new proposals for better security next month. They will include requiring 
every school to have a safety plan and better coordination between agencies and 
services that deal with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the district's 292 police officers patrol the 400 elementary schools and 
are stationed on all but 22 junior high and high school campuses. Thompson said 
he would like every secondary school to have a police officer on campus but 
that he probably will not have the money. 
</P>
<P>
 At the campuses where the shootings occurred -- Fairfax, Reseda, Dorsey and 
Chatsworth -- administrators say there is a renewed effort to focus on school 
security. They say they are working on new programs to increase students' 
awareness of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 At Reseda, students are producing skits about weapons and breaking the code of 
silence that exists among them about guns. The students also follow a dress 
code that bans clothing that could be viewed as gang attire. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of the shootings has been deep for students and staff on those 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I was going through that experience on January 21st, I knew that no matter 
what I did in this school district -- good or bad -- nothing would ever equal 
what I was doing that morning," said Michael Bennett, the principal at Fairfax. 
"It was 8:15 in the morning and boom, the history of this school changed with 
that heartbeat."

TIME RUNNING OUT ON LIBRARY'S SUNDAY HOURS; DOWNTOWN: POPULAR TIME AT THE 
CENTRAL LIBRARY MAY END SOON. PRIVATE FUNDING IS ABOUT TO CEASE, AND THE UNION 
OPPOSES KEEPING THE FACILITY OPEN AN EXTRA DAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sunday afternoon at the Los Angeles Public Library in Downtown has become a 
happy tableau of families pushing strollers through soaring rotundas, 
teen-agers playing computer games at handsome wooden carrels, and children 
reading books under panoramic murals.  
</P>
<P>
 The renovated and expanded edifice has the welcoming air of an intellectual 
shopping mall, with escalators taking patrons up through a sunny atrium into 
departments whose glass fronts seem to make them boutiques of history, 
literature and science. 
</P>
<P>
 But these leisurely weekends may be ending soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Private funding from the Ralph M. Parsons Foundation, not public dollars, is 
keeping the financially strapped library open on Sundays. All the money from 
the $100,000 grant will be used by the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the librarians union wants the library to close on Sundays and has 
told its members not to volunteer for Sunday duty. The union argues that even 
without Sunday duty, librarians are overworked, with 21% fewer librarians 
systemwide than three years ago. The union also says that on Sundays, when 
reference desks are staffed mostly with branch librarians relatively unfamiliar 
with the Central Library collection, the public gets substandard service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having (the library) open on Sundays is a public relations stunt," said Ivan 
Corpeno-Chavez, president of the librarians guild. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, the gimmick seems to be working. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sundays, dozens of people line up by the fountains outside the library's 
Flower Street entrance before its doors open at 1 p.m. On a recent weekend, 
many patrons were distressed to hear that Sunday hours may soon be ending. 
Although the library is open Saturdays, they said Sunday hours provide a 
precious resource on the only day they have time to come. Parking is cheaper 
and traffic is lighter on weekends, and other Downtown attractions nearby make 
even a long drive worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,000 people visit the library on a typical Sunday. That is fewer 
than on weekdays, even adjusting for the shorter Sunday hours. But usage is 
heavy; the library checks out nearly twice as many books per hour as on other 
days. When the library reopened in October, administrators decided to leave it 
open on Sundays for the first month to help showcase the renovations. The added 
hours proved so popular the library has been open on Sundays ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria and Chris Ondatje, waiting outside the library doors, said they come 
about twice a month, always on Sundays because of their work schedules. For 
this couple, the library has a sentimental attraction. Twenty-eight years ago, 
they met and courted here.  
</P>
<P>
 The library's resources helped Gloria Ondatje make a career change from 
banking to teaching, and she was here to research lesson plans for her classes 
with developmentally disabled children. Her husband was studying export 
opportunities overseas in hopes of starting his own business after he retires 
from a job with Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Ondatje argues that Sunday hours are so crucial that they are worth a 
sacrifice on the part of library staff. "If they're librarians and . . . enjoy 
serving the community, they have to give more than an ounce." If not, she says, 
"maybe they shouldn't be in that position." 
</P>
<P>
 Many people use Sundays at the library to do serious research, while others 
enjoy it for a family outing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lonna Balderas and her family drove from Lancaster, despite earthquake-damaged 
freeways, to see the newly renovated Pershing Square, visit the Grand Central 
Market on Broadway and enjoy the library. Her 13-month-old son grabs 
enthusiastically at a three-foot-high picture book in the children's section.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's very important to have Sunday hours. Sundays provide a great opportunity 
for families to spend quality time together in a beautiful building," Balderas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Librarian Elizabeth Martinez said that is an important role for the 
library. "I think we're changing Sundays in Downtown L.A.," she said. Several 
nearby restaurants have opened on weekends to serve library users, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Corpeno-Chavez of the union argues that revitalizing Downtown is not the 
job of librarians, and that their first priority should be connecting the 
public with the vast resources of the 2.2-million-volume library as effectively 
as possible. That is not happening on Sundays, many librarians say. 
</P>
<P>
 The quality of service goes down on Sundays, they say, because most of the 
people staffing the reference desks are relatively unfamiliar with the 
collections. Most staffers at the Central Library do not want to work Sunday as 
a sixth workday, so the majority of librarians are visiting from branches in 
order to expand their knowledge and earn overtime pay -- in defiance of the 
union's instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although librarians are professionally trained to be able to negotiate any 
collection, those fluent in a specialty can find sources more quickly for 
patrons, and help them find resources less familiar librarians might miss. 
</P>
<P>
 In the business and economics section one Sunday, three reference librarians 
scrambled to help long lines of library users. Dan Strehl, who works full time 
in the section and is thoroughly familiar with the section's 40 computerized 
databases and print collections, quickly referred a patron looking for listings 
of companies producing specific chemicals to a specialized directory. He knew 
off the top of his head where to find a list of the best prospects for export 
to Israel, and quickly helped a high school student doing a paper on the 
history of Coca-Cola. His two colleagues, children's librarians visiting from 
branches, frequently had to ask him and each other for advice.  
</P>
<P>
 "As a user, if you come on Sunday you don't get the best value for your money 
(as a taxpayer)," Strehl said. "The collection represents a significant public 
investment, so it's a waste if you get only 10 cents of information when 
there's $400 out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday duty is on a volunteer basis and merits overtime pay. But the union's 
chief objection is that Sunday may become part of the regular workweek at 
regular pay. Pay is a major point of contention since union members have been 
trying to renegotiate their contract for 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Another big problem with being open on Sundays, Corpeno-Chavez said, is that 
"it gives people the impression that everything's OK at the library when we're 
reeling from cutbacks." 
</P>
<P>
 The library got some good news Friday when the City Council approved a request 
from Martinez to free up 80 positions that have been frozen for several years. 
Although that will partially ease the staffing crunch, it will probably have no 
effect on Sunday hours. 
</P>
<P>
 While Martinez lobbies the city for more resources and the library's private 
fund-raising arm seeks corporate donors, the library is mulling a variety of 
options. One thing Martinez is considering is asking taxpayers to contribute 
more.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such a strategy might seem outlandish in tough economic times, but last year 
Pasadena showed that many citizens are willing to support their libraries. 
Voters decided overwhelmingly to tax themselves $20 per house and $13 per 
apartment each year in order to keep branches open and maintain the main 
library's Sunday hours.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Library Commission President Gary Ross said raising taxes would be 
"my last choice." However, "it is very, very necessary that something that 
plays this pivotal a role be open on Sundays," he said. "It's vital to the 
city's cultural life." 
</P>
<P>
 Other options being considered, Ross said, include attracting endowments by 
naming libraries after donors, allowing people to donate $1 through their water 
bills, and providing on-line catalogue and lending services to other library 
systems for a fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, at a time when law and order is on the minds of many voters, libraries 
are finding themselves a tough sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money is being taken from us and given to cops," Corpeno-Chavez said. "(Are) 
more cops going to make this a better city?" 
</P>
<P>
 Library boosters argue that giving children a safe and educational place to 
spend time on evenings and weekends is basic to improving public safety. The 
library is starting a program called Teenspace to address the interests of 
teen-agers and help them learn about careers and college.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of kids spend their time in the library. If they did not have the 
library they'd be on the street," Gloria Ondatje said.  
</P>
<P>
 On weekends, baggy-trousered teen-agers seem to be enjoying the library as 
much as grandmothers and small children. The library offers them not only 
books, but computers, videos and audiotapes, as well as storytelling hours and 
lectures. 
</P>
<P>
 "The library is the only public institution open to everyone all these hours, 
and free," Martinez said. "There is no alternative to the public library, 
period."

EVEN THE KEY TO DOUG HUSE'S HEART WAS MADE BY YALE & TOWNE; ANTIQUES: TWO 
WEATHERED OLD PADLOCKS SPARKED COLLECTOR'S PASSION FOR PIN-TUMBLER LATCHES. 
THIS WEEKEND, HE HAS ORGANIZED AN ANNUAL SHOW OF THE DEVICES.

<P>
 In a world where everything seems to be collected by somebody, Doug Huse has a 
lock on his hobby. 
</P>
<P>
 He collects Yale padlocks. And his cache of 500 produced over the last 130 
years by the Connecticut company has grown to be the largest in the western 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Huse's treasures are kept under lock and key, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 That is because although some weather-beaten old padlocks can be purchased for 
only a few dollars at garage sales, serious collectors are willing to pay up to 
$4,000 for the earliest Yale models. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, a weathered look can add to an old padlock's value. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to shine them up or paint them," Huse said. "If you find one 
with a nice patina on it, you can't make it look any better." 
</P>
<P>
 Locks have been around for several thousand years. But it took Linus Yale 
Jr.'s invention of a pin-tumbler latching device to produce the lock-and-key 
combination that remains in use today in homes and cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Yale patented his revolutionary lock in 1861. It uses a series of pins that 
hold a rotating locking plug in place until a properly notched key is inserted. 
The notches make the pins rise and release the plug. 
</P>
<P>
 Huse's interest in Yale was triggered by a pair of old padlocks clamped to two 
forgotten gates at his uncle's sprawling cattle ranch in the Cuyama Valley, 
between Bakersfield and Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a kid I'd go up there in the summers. I'd always see these old locks on 
ranch gates that were way back off Highway 166," said Huse, 52. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 15 years ago I found a key hanging on a nail in the barn and decided to 
see if it fit those old locks. I went out and tried it and, sure enough, it 
worked! It was amazing -- what still works after 50 years?" 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery unlocked Huse's curiosity about mechanical devices that are 
sturdy enough to survive freezing winters and blazing summers in the dusty 
foothills -- not to mention pushy cows and determined, two-legged trespassers. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon he was buying every Yale lock he could find. Then he started hunting for 
Yale & Towne Manufacturing Co. posters, catalogues, lock code books and keys. 
</P>
<P>
 Patiently tinkering with his Yales turned Huse into a lock-picking expert. 
Eventually, he left the advertising business and became a Pasadena locksmith. 
</P>
<P>
 During this weekend, Huse organized the 17th annual West Coast Lock Collectors 
Show, which drew 45 collectors and several thousand visitors to the Embassy 
Suites Hotel in Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
 Displays include handcuffs, miniature vaults and antique chastity belts. Even 
better, there is an 1832 lock made by Linus Yale Sr. that was brought by 
collector Tom Gallian of North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Huse does not own that lock. Yet. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he remains a patient man. And with a hobby like his, patience is 
the key.

 Oxnard resident April Senecal darted toward the rows of gaudily decorated cat 
cages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you seen the cat in the hammock?" she called out. "Oh, this is 
incredible. You have to see this." 
</P>
<P>
 Hidden beneath the orange drapery cloaking his cage, an 8-month-old cat named 
Hammer lay on his back, napping soundly in a kitty-size hammock stretched 
across his compartment. His paws neatly folded over his stomach, the feline 
appeared undisturbed by the dozens of people wandering around him. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is how he acts at home," said Dick Kallmeyer of Castroville, who takes 
Hammer -- a member of the Scottish Fold breed -- to shows almost every weekend. 
"But he loves motel rooms. He loves to run and jump around." 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer was one of 180 cats being shown Saturday at the Cat Fancier's Assn. 
regional competition, which drew breeders from across the state to the Ventura 
County Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, which continues today, is the only major cat show in Ventura County 
this year, show manager Becky Orlando said. The next one will be in January, 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the only place you can see 40 different cat breeds as well as people 
selling everything from ridiculous toys to necessities," said Orlando, who 
breeds exotic shorthairs and had four cats in the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando said 101 purebred champion-class cats competed Saturday, with every 
breed from Abyssinian to Siamese represented. Also vying for honors were 35 
kittens, 10 household cats and 28 premiers -- the term for a purebred cat that 
has been spayed or neutered. 
</P>
<P>
 Breeders washed, brushed, combed and polished their cats with hairspray-like 
products before taking them into competition. Instead of show rings seen at dog 
shows, the cats were presented on tables, where judges examined them for 
appearance and conformity to standards for each breed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some owners brought as may as four or five felines in hopes that one would be 
named First Cat. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors watched as the judges poked and prodded the fluffy competitors. 
Although the household cat division was the smallest, it was one of the most 
popular. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the household cats better because they're not all poofed," said 
10-year-old Jade Gutierrez of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura resident Mary Lindley, a regular cat-show visitor, said her two 
felines -- especially the 19-pounder -- would probably be unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I brought mine here, they'd probably say they were overweight," Lindley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando said many people don't enter household pets because of the expense. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a $50 entry fee," she said. "It's a lot of money for people." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvia Fitzgerald, one of the judges for household cats, said she has seen 
some unusual combinations in her 20 years of judging. 
</P>
<P>
 "I often wonder how Mother Nature arrived at some of these cats," she said. "I 
always feel very sorry for them. I find myself apologizing to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the purebreds, Fitzgerald said, the household cats aren't judged by set 
standards. Instead, they are rated on their appearance or presentation and how 
they handle themselves in competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Such any-pet-can-enter competitions are unique to cat shows, Fitzgerald said. 
"They don't do this in the dog world." 
</P>
<P>
 Nipomo resident Dianne Mullikin would know. Mullikin, a professional dog 
breeder, said she takes her feline pets to cat shows as a vacation from dog 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just for fun, to get out of the house," she said. "These are just 
household pets, they don't have a pedigree." 
</P>
<P>
 They don't have pedigree names either. Mullikin's cats -- David and Mr. Cat -- 
stood out in a room full of exotic names like Pawsitively, Azurski and 
StormSong. 
</P>
<P>
 And unlike the polished purebreds around them, Mullikin's cats have seen life 
on the other side of the tracks. Both of the felines she has in competition 
were rescued. She found David, a black-and-white alley cat, at a gas station in 
Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was his first time in the show ring and he was First Cat," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But David didn't appear to care about his peach-colored ribbon. He seemed more 
interested in the container of chicken livers just beyond paw's reach from his 
cage.

STUDY'S GOOD NEWS CLOUDS WATER DEBATE; VENTURA: TOLD THAT ITS SOURCES ARE 
ADEQUATE FOR 16 YEARS, CITY MAY DELAY PLANS FOR EITHER A DESALINATION PLANT OR 
A PIPELINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Since the depths of the drought, Ventura has been wracked by debate over the 
best way to supply the city with more water: a desalination plant or a pipeline 
to the state water system. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a consultant has told the city it won't need a new source of water for at 
least 16 years. But that seemingly welcome development has only complicated the 
politically charged debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a case of getting good news and not wanting it," Mayor Tom Buford said. 
"It would almost be easier to make a decision if the news was bad." 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders and political activists say the latest study, which concludes 
that Ventura has more water available than was previously estimated, may simply 
postpone a resolution of the city's water options. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall, the Ventura City Council is scheduled to vote on whether to scrap 
a proposed desalination plant, consider other water sources or let a future 
City Council decide. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura now gets its water from Lake Casitas, the Ventura River and 
underground aquifers. All three sources were depleted during the drought, 
causing city leaders to look for an additional source of water. 
</P>
<P>
 After ruling out such exotic options as towing icebergs from Alaska, city 
leaders were left with two possibilities: a desalination plant -- favored by 
environmentalists and slow-growth advocates -- or a state water pipeline, 
preferred by business and agricultural interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters had their say in an advisory measure in November, 1992, and they 
preferred desalination over state water by a margin of 55% to 45%. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the City Council was divided on the desalination plant, council 
members began spending money on studies for the plant, even after the drought 
ended and the urgency of building a plant lessened. To date, the city has spent 
nearly $530,000 on such studies. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest findings by Boyle Engineering could be used by desalination 
opponents to justify delaying or dumping the project -- a move that would leave 
the door open for state water. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Weber Young, who helped lead the 1992 campaign for state water, called 
the report "a large blow" to the desalination movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said she doubts state water interests will begin clamoring to build a 
pipeline instead. But she said city leaders now have time to look at 
opportunities for cooperation with other cities and water agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The city could consider building a pipeline in conjunction with other agencies 
-- an option not seriously considered in 1992 -- that would be cheaper than 
constructing a desalination plant, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Steve Bennett, who helped lead the campaign for desalination in 
November, 1992, said the report is not a major setback for the desalination 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what this report did was validate the desal option," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 While saying a desalination plant won't be needed for at least 16 years, the 
report also said it would face no significant regulatory obstacles and that the 
water it produced would be cheaper than originally estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said he will continue to push his fellow council members to approve a 
long-term water plan that would include building a desalination plant as well 
as increasing water-storage capacity and building new treatment plants. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bennett may have a hard time doing that. He and Gary Tuttle are the only 
members of the seven-member council who publicly support desalination. Two 
others favor state water, and the other three say they are undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 With three council members up for reelection next year, the report could also 
be used to postpone the tough decision of whether to go ahead with the 
desalination plant. Both desalination and state water supporters may want to 
delay a decision in hopes of electing council members who will vote the way 
they want. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jim Monahan, an avid state water supporter, said he thinks the 
council now has some leeway to make an informed decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we need to do anything just now," Monahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monahan said he does not put much stock in the citizens' advisory vote 
because, he said, residents were confused about what they were voting on. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of misinformation circulating during the campaign," Monahan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buford said he is undecided, but he wants the council to make a decision soon. 
Council members Greg Carson and Rosa Lee Measures say they also are undecided, 
while Councilman Jack Tingstrom favors state water. 
</P>
<P>
 Most council members say they want to resolve the issue this year to avoid 
looking indecisive with the public. City officials say all work on the 
desalination plant has been halted until the council makes a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we should become comfortable because of the new time frame and 
put it on the back burner," Measures said. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members acknowledged that even if they do approve a long-term 
water plan for the city that includes a desalination plant someday, there is 
nothing to prevent a future council from junking the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to set a definite course," Buford said. "The only way to prevent the 
issue from surfacing is to either build a desal plant or build a pipeline. But 
nothing will be built right now because I think we'd all agree at this point, 
we're not desperate."

APPEALS OVER PROPERTY ASSESSMENTS SOAR; REAL ESTATE: ABOUT 3,600 CLAIM THEY ARE 
PAYING BLOATED TAXES. AUTHORITIES WARN SOME OF THE CASES MAY NOT BE HEARD FOR 
TWO YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Record numbers of frustrated property owners have filed appeals with Ventura 
County since July, requesting cuts in the assessed value of their homes and 
businesses because of the continuing decline of the region's real estate 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 From Simi Valley to Ventura, about 3,600 owners have claimed that they pay 
bloated taxes on properties whose market values are far less than shown on 
county rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the fiscal year on June 30, officials expect appeals to rise to 
4,000 -- about 5 1/2 times greater than in 1989-90 when real estate values 
peaked. 
</P>
<P>
 Those filing appeals include the owners of such high-profile properties as the 
Price Club in Oxnard and The Oaks mall in Thousand Oaks. But most are 
homeowners such as Jeanne Clark, who bought her house when real estate prices 
peaked, only to see values drop for four consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the perfect victim of the economy in California," said Clark, 35, a real 
estate broker who bought her modest Oxnard home in 1989 for $230,000. It is now 
officially valued at $178,000 after two successful appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's for sale for $170,000," she said. "And I haven't had an offer yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Clark is fortunate in one way. Her most recent appeal has already been 
granted. Authorities warn that some of the 4,000 new appeals may not be 
considered for nearly two years because of an ever-growing backlog of cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The current backlog is about 3,600, including 300 complicated business and 
industrial cases filed at least 18 months ago but which require special 
attention, county Assessor Glenn Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know the values have gone down, so it's just a matter of us getting to 
them," Gray said. "We've had some huge increases in workload." 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors impaneled a second Assessment Appeals Board last fall 
so the county can deal with appeals within two years, as required by state law. 
Failure to meet that deadline would result in an automatic lowering of values 
to the levels claimed by owners. 
</P>
<P>
 While adding a second appeals panel, county supervisors have cut staffing in 
the assessor's office by 36 jobs over three years to 113 today because of tight 
budgets, Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
 The surge of pending appeals -- up from just 730 four years ago -- has 
occurred not only because property values continue to drop, but because owners 
now expect the real estate slump to last, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a greater public awareness as time goes on that these reductions in 
value are not for just a year or two," said Bruce Gray, chief deputy assessor. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor John K. Flynn, who sits on one of the assessment appeal boards, 
said homeowners used to dominate the appeals process, but many more businesses 
are now seeking relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mood of the appellant is just one of, 'Hey, the economy hit us and here 
we are,' " Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses seeking help range from old shopping malls to newer industrial 
buildings and vacant parcels improved with water and sewer hookups, but which 
languish without construction. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Parker Hannifin Corp. has filed to reduce the $10.8-million 
assessment on its 9-year-old aerospace parts plant in Moorpark to $5.5 million. 
Resolution is expected soon to meet a July deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Other older, complicated cases include the Price Club's request to drop the 
value of its 8-year-old Oxnard outlet by more than half, to $4.9 million. That 
appeal, like many others, is based on a reduction in the value of real estate, 
said county tax analyst Jim Dodd. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, the partnership that owns a nearly new Westlake Boulevard 
office building wants its value cut from $16 million to $9 million. At the 
nearby Oaks mall, owners have appealed for a cut in value from $129 million to 
$35 million, Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a government-versus-government twist, two federal agencies that have 
seized dozens of insolvent local businesses have filed several appeals. In one 
case, the federal Resolution Trust Corp. has agreed to continue paying taxes on 
the small Bellwood Center in Simi Valley, but wants its value cut nearly in 
half to $4.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 95% of all appeals are resolved before reaching the two assessment 
boards, Assessor Gray said. But in the older cases, even successful property 
owners sometimes are dissatisfied because their new values are pegged to the 
date they appealed -- nearly two years before. As a result, their properties 
may now be worth much less than they had claimed. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion of appeals has occurred despite the assessor's effort to cut 
property values automatically, without owners ever filing an appeal, Assessor 
Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
 The assessor has already granted reductions this fiscal year on 49,000 parcels 
-- about 22% of all those in the county -- after a computer compared current 
sales prices with values of comparable homes. Automatic reappraisals will be 
expanded even more next year as many businesses are included for the first 
time, Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
 The value on the vast majority of homes purchased between March, 1988, and 
December, 1992, was rolled back for 1993-94, Assessor Gray said. The rollbacks 
are required since the current market value is not as great as original 
purchase prices, which established taxable value. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of properties automatically receiving lower appraisals has nearly 
doubled in three years as the value of the average Ventura County home has 
continued to drop. 
</P>
<P>
 An average home here cost $261,600 in 1989 after an increase from $189,625 in 
1987. But that inflated price was pricked by the recession. The average price 
last year was $234,381, and it is still declining despite a promising increase 
in home sales, according to TRW REDI Property Data. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with so many reassessments, the value of all property in Ventura County 
increased 2.2% last fiscal year because of new construction and because most 
properties that sold were reassessed at higher values. 
</P>
<P>
 But last year's growth was modest compared to the 13.5% increase in 1990-91. 
And officials expect the increase to be even less this year. Home Prices 
</P>
<P>
 Average home prices in Ventura County have dropped each year since peaking in 
1989.

WEEDING OUT A KILLER; REPLANTING AIMS TO RESTORE HABITAT OVERRUN BY ARUNDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RODNEY BOSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Using a stick of dried arundo grass as his measuring tool, 7-year-old Andrew 
Krasowski got on his knees to mark a spot every three feet. That way, his dad 
would know just where to plant the mule fat and willow branches. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Krasowski, his wife, Jo, and Andrew were part of a team of volunteers who 
offered their elbow grease Saturday to help restore the Arroyo Simi in Moorpark 
to its natural state. 
</P>
<P>
 It was part of an effort, led by the Moorpark chapter of the Environmental 
Coalition, to replant five acres of shoreline habitat with native vegetation 
along a meandering stretch of the flood channel running through the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Once sprouting a variety of willow bushes and other native vegetation, the 
arroyo has become congested with arundo, a weed which -- if left unchecked -- 
could choke out all other vegetation, said Environmental Coalition member 
Roseann Mikos. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearty arundo grass, which lines many of Southern California's flood 
channels and rivers, was originally introduced to prevent erosion, but has had 
unforeseen consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 "The arundo grass overpowers the roots of native plants that belong there," 
Mikos said. "And it's no good for wildlife. The animals that would want to live 
there can't -- it's not their natural habitat." 
</P>
<P>
 The first phase of the restoration was completed last October, when work crews 
cut down several tons of the dense growing, bamboo-like grass, which can grow 
up to 30 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
 By noon Saturday, about 40 volunteers -- including a Moorpark Cub Scout pack, 
high school students and Environmental Coalition members -- were scattered 
along the gently flowing flood channel for the next phase. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking instructions from project manager Mikos, work crews picked up trash 
that littered the area and commenced the replanting, which is scheduled to 
continue through March. 
</P>
<P>
 First they created holes by driving into the ground one-inch-think "rebar," a 
steel pipe commonly used for reinforcement. Then they pushed 20-inch cuttings 
-- trimmed from existing native plants in the area -- into the moist ground and 
firmly packed the surrounding soil. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're out here because we wanted to help save the riverbed," said Mike 
Krasowski, 42, of Moorpark. "Driving by here, I'd rather see a little bit of 
nature than cement." 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret and John Kirnig of Moorpark searched for the elusive red willow -- 
which they hoped to use to make cuttings -- along the banks of the arroyo, 
where the chirping of songbirds mixed with the drone of passing cars on the 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a perfect day to be out here," said Margaret Kirnig, who was enjoying 
the sunny weather and cool breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the cuttings from native plants, about 200 sycamore and cottonwood 
trees -- purchased with grant money -- will eventually be planted along the 
five-acre stretch of arroyo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark portion of the Arroyo Simi was chosen for replanting because its 
banks are lined with the least amount of concrete, Mikos said, and offers the 
best hope for a return of natural habitat -- if the arundo grass can be 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "The arundo grass is like Freddy Krueger from 'Nightmare On Elm Street,' " 
said California Department of Transportation biologist Paul Caron as he 
prepared willow branches for planting. "It just keeps coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 "But by replanting, we're giving the native vegetation a chance to dominate," 
said Caron, who was helping supervise the effort for Caltrans, which owns the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 A return of native vegetation will attract and maintain bigger populations of 
songbirds, snowy egrets, herons and the endangered least Bell's vireo, Caron 
said. Hawks and owls are also expected to return to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the weekend volunteer efforts, California Conservation Corps crews and 
students from local schools will be assisting during weekdays, Mikos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikos said the replanting must be accomplished by the end of March, the end of 
seasonal rain and the beginning of the nesting season. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an ideal place to encourage nesting, and we don't want to be here 
when the birds try to nest," she said.

22 INJURED AS PICKUP, MTA BUS COLLIDE; CRASH: TRANSIT AGENCY SAYS THE TRUCK'S 
DRIVER APPARENTLY RAN A RED LIGHT. HE AND HIS PASSENGER WERE LISTED IN CRITICAL 
CONDITION.

 Twenty people were injured, two critically, after a Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority bus collided Saturday afternoon with a pickup truck at 
a busy South-Central Los Angeles intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 1:20 p.m. at Avalon Boulevard and Manchester 
Avenue, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck, a tan, 1982 Chevrolet, was traveling north on Avalon Boulevard and 
apparently ran a red light, said Clara Poltes-Fellow, an MTA spokeswoman. It 
hit the bus head-on as it headed west on Manchester Avenue, Poltes-Fellow said. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck's two occupants, a 77-year-old man and a woman, were taken to Martin 
Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center where they were reported in critical 
condition, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was identified by a hospital spokeswoman as L.T. Arimington, who 
received injuries to his head and abdomen. The woman, who was not identified, 
was believed to be Arimington's wife, the spokeswoman said. She received head 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus, which travels along Manchester from Norwalk to Marina del Rey, was 
hit near the driver's side. As many as 20 people aboard, including the driver, 
were injured. About half were treated at the scene, said Jim Wells of the Los 
Angeles Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten were taken to hospitals, including Daniel Freeman Memorial Medical Center, 
St. Francis Medical Center, H. Claude Hudson Hospital and Hubert Humphrey 
Hospital, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus driver was treated at the scene for neck and shoulder injuries.  
</P>
<P>
 The accident is under investigation, but Clark said witnesses, apart from 
those involved in the accident, are scarce.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SANTA CLARA RIVER; 13 BIRDS INJURED IN OIL SPILL RETURNED TO 
WILD

 Weeks of scrubbing and rehabilitation paid off Saturday for 13 birds as they 
returned to the wild after being injured by oil spilled into the Santa Clara 
River. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescue crews from the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the state Department of 
Fish and Game and the International Bird Rescue and Research Center watched as 
biologists pulled the cleaned birds from cardboard boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13 Virginia and Sora rails were found covered in oil after a pipeline in 
Valencia ruptured during last month's earthquake and dumped about 200,000 
gallons of oil into the river. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very satisfying to see that they at least get a chance to survive," said 
Barrie Todd, a U. S. Fish and Wildlife worker on hand for the send-off. "A very 
small percentage of the wildlife injured in a spill like this are found and 
successfully rehabilitated." MATTHEW MOSK

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OJAI; MAN SERIOUSLY INJURED AFTER 75-FOOT FALL

 An Oxnard man was in serious condition Saturday after he fell 75 feet while 
rock climbing on an icy mountainside north of Ojai, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saul Magana, 18, was taken by helicopter to Ventura County Medical Center 
after sustaining head trauma from the fall, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Magana had traveled with friends to the mountain area in search of snow, said 
officials of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. When they found none, the 
men attempted to climb up the back side of Pine Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Magana's climbing partners told hospital officials that as the climbers got 
higher on the rocks they ran into patches of ice, which caused Magana to fall, 
a nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials said Magana had consumed two 40 ounce bottles of beer 
before starting the climb. 
</P>
<P>
 After Magana fell 75 feet from the rocks, his friends hiked down the mountain, 
hailed a passing motorist on California 33 and asked him to call for help, a 
sheriff's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 When deputies arrived, Magana was unconscious, and hospital officials said he 
had not regained consciousness by late Saturday. MATTHEW MOSK

GROUP SAYS HISTORY OF WOMEN'S INEQUITY STILL REPEATS ITSELF; RIGHTS: LOCAL AAUW 
BRANCH FOCUSES ON EDUCATING CHILDREN. GROUP'S ACTIVITIES VARY, BUT THEIR COMMON 
THREAD IS EQUALITY. 
</P>

<P>
 A young girl's declaration that "only boys could be doctors" still motivates 
the Thousand Oaks members of the American Assn. of University Women. 
</P>
<P>
 It began innocently enough, about nine years ago, when teacher Sandy Hindy 
took her 7-year-old daughter to the doctor after she had fallen from the bars 
on the school playground. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said she thought it would be fun to work in a doctor's office, but when I 
asked her what she would want to do, she said she would be the nurse because 
only boys could be doctors," Hindy recalled. "I was shocked that my 
second-grade daughter could have such a thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Hindy told the AAUW members about the comment, and it inspired them to begin a 
program in Thousand Oaks elementary schools in 1985 to educate students about 
women's history. Today, Hindy's story is passed along like folklore, a lesson 
for members about getting involved and solving problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women still face discrimination in schools at every level," said Beverly 
Khoshnevisan, president of AAUW's Thousand Oaks branch. "Whether it's 
elementary school books which ignore women's contributions or university 
professors being held back because of their gender, there is still a lot to be 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 And AAUW is attempting to do it.  
</P>
<P>
 The group, with 335 active members, is one of the largest nonprofit 
organizations in the Thousand Oaks area and has dozens of programs, ranging 
from the purely social to the intensely political. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the group's largest and most popular events is an annual, daylong fair 
called "Creative Options: A Day for Women," scheduled for Saturday. This year's 
seminars, which attract people from around the state, are already filled, 
organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The branch has a bridge club and a book club. They run educational seminars 
and a summer day camp. But there is a common theme for all the programs -- 
equity for women. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal of the organization from the very beginning was the advancement of 
women," Khoshnevisan explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, much has changed since a group of 17 college women met for the 
first time at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1881. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time it was impossible for women to find jobs commensurate with their 
college degrees," Khoshnevisan said. "Back then it was mostly a matter of 
networking, but the problems we look at today are a bit more complex." 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks branch, which formed in 1966, has focused since its 
inception on a handful of issues pertaining to the treatment of women and girls 
in education. 
</P>
<P>
 Hindy said her program to teach elementary students about historical 
contributions of women helps compensate for what she said is the lack of 
recognition given to women in most history textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 She and a group of AAUW members decided that the best way to inform boys and 
girls about the role of women in history was to research important women, dress 
up in costume and role-play. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year they visit local schools dressed as different women in history. Past 
presentations have included pilot Amelia Earhart, astronaut Sally Ride, U.S. 
Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and, of course, the first woman 
doctor, Elizabeth Blackwell. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was so well received that the AAUW decided to publish a book 
including 15 of the scripts it had written for the talks. The book, titled 
"Profiles of Women, Past & Present," has sold about 600 copies nationwide, and 
Hindy said it continues to sell well and is becoming more widely used. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another focus of the group is to increase the number of girls who are 
interested in careers in science. 
</P>
<P>
 The group holds a science fair for girls in grades six through 10 that brings 
together local female doctors, biologists, engineers and scientists from nearby 
companies such as Amgen and Rockwell International. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal is for the girls to see that there are options for them in math and 
science," said Ricki Mikkelsen, the group's president-elect. "When they meet 
these women and see what they've accomplished, it really opens their eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's Math and Science Conference, originally scheduled for Jan. 17, was 
canceled because of the earthquake and has not yet been rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to educating young people on the opportunities for women, the 
group occasionally attempts to tackle political issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Khoshnevisan calls the group nonpolitical, it has been known to take 
stands on some controversial issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The AAUW caused a stir last year when board members from the Thousand Oaks 
branch appeared at a Conejo Valley Unified School District meeting to protest a 
sex-education pamphlet that was proposed for use in the district's schools. 
</P>
<P>
 While hundreds of parents showed up to support the 19-page booklet, the seven 
members of AAUW stood their ground, arguing that the pamphlet was inappropriate 
because it tied sexual issues to Christian values. 
</P>
<P>
 The AAUW's objections resulted in the deletion of a portion of the pamphlet, 
and the booklet was eventually approved only for teacher reference and not for 
distribution among students. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Mikkelsen said, religious groups protested the AAUW's annual "day for 
women" at Cal Lutheran University because of a round-table discussion on 
abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may not be a political group, but we don't ignore political issues that 
are important to women," Mikkelsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stir over abortion was good for everybody because it got us talking," she 
said. "Even though people in AAUW don't all agree on the issue, we all feel 
like it's a good thing to be discussing it openly." 
</P>
<P>
 Barb Wilson, a vice president, said the national organization chooses stands 
on issues by polling its more than 135,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a small group of people at the top saying, 'You're going to support 
reproductive rights,' " Wilson said. "This is very much a grass-roots type of 
organization." 
</P>
<P>
 To keep it that way, she said, AAUW needs to attract all types of people. And 
to do that means a diverse type of programming. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Each month, across Thousand Oaks, the women of AAUW meet to collectively read 
plays, discuss international issues, or participate in a number of outings and 
athletic trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Khoshnevisan said she first learned of the AAUW when she moved to Newbury Park 
and needed to find a baby-sitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard about a baby-sitting co-op run by this group called AAUW, and I had 
no idea what it was, but I was a desperate mother," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the co-op, she learned about the dozens of other programs, like the 
investment club, the children's theater and the positive parenting group. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how most people get involved," Khoshnevisan said. "We have so many 
different things going on that people just get drawn in." 
</P>
<P>
 Much like the group itself, the fair at Cal Lutheran has a diverse program of 
events, with talks on subjects ranging from women's spirituality to conflict 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spirit of AAUW's original founders, there will even be a talk about 
networking. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want there to be something for everyone," said Mikkelsen, who is one of 
the organizers of the event. "We want to help women get involved and get ahead. 
It's what our group has always stood for."

YOUTH DRUG STUDY HAS MIXED RESULTS; SURVEY: COCAINE AND ALCOHOL USE BY HIGH 
SCHOOL UPPERCLASSMEN SHOWS DROP WHILE YOUNGER STUDENTS REPORT RISE IN MARIJUANA 
AND INHALANT USE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A recently released survey has given Pasadena Unified School District students 
mixed marks on drug use. The same study sent a somber message on their exposure 
to violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey of 2,800 Pasadena and Altadena students in grades four through 12 
was the second of five annual studies by the USC Institute for Health Promotion 
and Disease Prevention Research. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent results showed alcohol and cocaine to be on the decline with 
upperclassmen. Underclassmen and middle-school students, however, showed signs 
of increasing marijuana and inhalant use. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of grade level, the majority of students reported fear of violence. 
Many said they knew someone who had been shot or otherwise injured by gang 
violence, some fatally. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, conducted last spring, found that slightly more than 36% of 11th- 
and 12th-graders reported alcohol use in the preceding 30 days, down from about 
46% in 1992. The number of students in those grades who said they had consumed 
alcohol during the preceding week declined to 16.5% from 29.5% in 1992. Cocaine 
use among that group declined from 5.2% to 1.7% in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Marijuana, however, made a comeback among ninth- and 10th-graders, with 12.6% 
having used that substance in the preceding 30 days, up from 7% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Among younger students, the survey contained both good and bad news. On the 
positive side, there was a 10% decline in the number of seventh- and 
eighth-graders who said they had tried alcohol -- 65.6%, compared with 75.2% in 
1992. But 5% more students sniffed glue, paint, gasoline and other noxious 
substances than in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Cigarette-smoking declined among younger students. Of those in grades four 
through six, 5.9% said they had tried cigarettes, compared with 8.8% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual survey is sponsored by Day One, a coalition of Pasadena and 
Altadena businesses, city agencies and nonprofit groups. The goal of the 
five-year study is to assess the effectiveness of drug programs for youths and 
determine ways to improve them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she was "pleasantly surprised" at the sharp drop in alcohol use, Day 
One Executive Director Francisca Neumann did not find the increased use of some 
other substances surprising. 
</P>
<P>
 She attributed the disparity to more focused efforts against alcohol and 
cocaine. "But on marijuana and inhalants, you don't see that message broadcast 
loud and clear as a no-no. They haven't been targeted as strongly," Neumann 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Day One survey results were released shortly after the publication of 
national figures on school-age drug use compiled by the University of Michigan 
for the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The national study showed that after 
years of steady decline, illicit drug use is making a comeback on some levels, 
particularly involving marijuana, LSD and amphetamines. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the national results, 28% of high school seniors admitted having 
had five or more drinks in one sitting during the two weeks preceding the 
survey. The local figure was half that, with 14.2% of Pasadena and Altadena 
upperclassmen reporting they had been drunk within the preceding 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 While the respondents may have sent mixed messages on the use of illicit 
substances, the statistics formed one clear message: An increasing cloud of 
violence hangs over students' lives. 
</P>
<P>
 In the local survey, 55% of ninth- and 10th-graders said they knew individuals 
injured or killed as a result of gang fights. Fifty-one percent feared being 
shot. Eleven percent carry a gun when they go out. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a third of 11th- and 12th-graders said they have had a firearm pointed 
at them. Two-thirds knew someone who had been shot and nearly half -- 48% -- 
said they knew someone who had died or been injured in a gang fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Vera J. Vignes, Pasadena Unified School District superintendent, said the 
statistics on violence were among the survey's most jarring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Day One survey, she said, "does not let us forget that we have to come 
together to ensure the safety of our children."

OFFICIALS, FAMILY BATTLE OVER TEEPEE; CLAREMONT: RATHER THAN PURCHASE A $150 
CITY PERMIT, THE OWNERS HAVE REMOVED THE STRUCTURE. THE INCIDENT HAS SPARKED A 
COMMUNITY CONTROVERSY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CARLSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Little tepee is not small. It stands about 18 feet high and towers over 
the white picket fence that borders Edward F. Little's yard at 1170 Indian Hill 
Blvd. in Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
 The Littles would erect the tepee whenever their nieces and nephews came to 
visit, or for occasional educational field trips for school groups. 
</P>
<P>
 So for the past 30 years, neighbors caught occasional glimpses of children 
playing in front of the buffalo painted on its canvas sides as they pulled into 
their driveways. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Jan. 7, the Littles received a letter from the Community Development 
Department stating that the tepee "detracted from the character of our 
neighborhoods" and violated the city's land use and development code. 
</P>
<P>
 The department issued an ultimatum: Take down the tepee, purchase a $150 
permit for an "unattached accessory structure," or face a fine. The Littles 
complied and removed the tepee, but the incident has sparked a community 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The tepee) doesn't bother a soul except bureaucrats and people who think 
they should run our lives for us," said Conrad Casler, a neighbor who wrote a 
letter to the Claremont Courier to protest the city's action. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real ironic thing is that the city doesn't want a tepee on Indian Hill 
Boulevard," said Casler, a 64-year-old retired journalist, who noted that the 
Cahuilla Indian tribe used to live on the real Indian Hill about three blocks 
away from Little's house. 
</P>
<P>
 Courier Publisher Martin Weinberger added that the tepee has been embroiled in 
controversies previously. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the '60s, we used the tepee in a Fourth of July celebration, and city 
officials told us we had to take it down. They thought it might be interpreted 
as a Communist protest of the Vietnam War," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the issue is more a matter of codes than politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has nothing to do with whether it's a tepee or a yurt or an igloo," said 
Sharon Wood, director of community development. "It was an accessory structure 
without a permit, and it was up for a month, and it was large and visible from 
the public right of way." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood explained that when one of the Claremont Colleges wanted to erect a yurt 
a few years ago -- a Mongolian tentlike structure -- the students had to apply 
for and buy a $150 special use and development permit. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he had applied for a permit, there would have been no problem. If he had 
left it up for just a weekend, we probably wouldn't have bothered," she said. 
"But it was up for a month, and many of us on staff kept driving by and seeing 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Little tepee's big controversy has left family members pondering why the 
community is making such a fuss. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, I haven't dealt with it, but at some point I'll go down to 
City Hall and talk to them. So far, it's been a basic laugh for me," said Lance 
Little, who inherited the tepee from his father Edward, who built it. 
</P>
<P>
 The tepee remains at his father's house, but Lance started putting it up and 
taking it down when his father tired of the chore. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put it up for my niece and nephew over Christmas. We can't leave it up all 
the time, anyway -- it's too hard on the canvas. Well, I got busy and didn't 
take it down, and about the time I was ready to take it down, we got the 
letter," said Little, 41, who owns a garage door-installation business in 
Upland.

CHURCH TAKES PUPILS DISPLACED BY QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The row of fluttering blue and yellow balloons tethered to a chain-link fence 
at St. John the Evangelist Church welcomed 190 students recently from 
earthquake-damaged Nativity School, a small campus in South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the quake happened, the diocese was brainstorming about what they could 
do, and came up with this," said St. John Principal Margaret Welle. "It's real 
lucky we had the space here. We're glad to be able to accommodate them." 
</P>
<P>
 As Catholic school officials pondered what to do with the displaced Nativity 
population, Welle and a local Catholic school administrator suggested using the 
little-used rooms on St. John's campus and in its parish hall basement across 
Victoria Avenue from the church.  
</P>
<P>
 Though it meant that the school would be divided -- kindergarten through 
fourth grade on one side of the street, fifth and sixth on another -- most of 
the Nativity staff, students and parents welcomed the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "To find all this room was nothing short of a miracle," said Nativity 
Principal Sister Ann Dermody, surrounded by stacks of cardboard boxes in her 
makeshift office in the basement. 
</P>
<P>
 Classroom essentials, such as desks with books still inside, were moved 
wholesale; computer and library materials, file cabinets and other equipment 
will remain while Nativity's fate is being decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Nativity's church was relatively unharmed by the quake, the school 
was hit hard. The main kitchen and several bathrooms are unusable, access to 
rooms was cut off, holes were ripped through walls, ceilings cracked and many 
rooms have been condemned. 
</P>
<P>
 The school was seismically retrofitted in 1988, "probably the only reason it's 
still standing," Welle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though quickly prepared, the basement quarters at St. John's parish hall have 
the pleasant air of a new apartment, smelling of fresh paint and just-laid 
carpet. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth- and sixth-grade students readily adjusted to being seated in an 
open room, remaining studiously quiet as teachers alternated instruction and 
individual activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy to be in school again, even though we have to work extra hard to 
catch up," said 11-year-old Jose Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being at home three weeks felt like being in jail." 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of Nativity's students swells the kindergarten through 
eighth-grade population at St. John by two-thirds, but the schools will operate 
fairly independently of each other. 
</P>
<P>
 While bathroom and playground facilities are shared on the main campus, the 
parish hall has its own playground and other facilities. Ill-equipped to deal 
with more students, the small cafeteria serves cold lunches to Nativity 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they are pleased with the arrangement, Welle and Dermody said they are 
worried about ongoing student transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Nativity parents don't own cars; few can afford monthly bus passes for 
their children. Most students were taxied over to St. John by teachers and 
parents who coordinated pools.  
</P>
<P>
 The principals have been unsuccessful in getting bus services donated by local 
politicians or organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "MTA has already said no," said Dermody. "Parents said at a meeting we had 
before coming here that they wanted to do something about transportation, but 
didn't know what to do. We're hoping something will happen. Today everything is 
fine, but tomorrow, who knows?"

NEIGHBORS ORGANIZE AGAINST DEVELOPMENT; BRENTWOOD: THE GROUP HAS MOUNTED SUCH 
STRONG OPPOSITION TO A PLAN FOR 34 ESTATE-SIZE HOUSES THAT IT MIGHT BE 
SCUTTLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On a March morning four years ago, Eric Edmunds awoke to the sounds of the 
future outside his door: Down below his Mandeville Canyon home, workers were 
busy chopping away the chaparral to make room for a housing development, the 
first in Brentwood in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was too late to prevent construction of that 13-lot, 98-acre 
project, known as Brentwood Country Estates, Edmunds and other like-minded 
residents of the Santa Monica Mountains vowed not to let another development 
invade their scenic environs.  
</P>
<P>
 So when a Canadian developer announced plans the following year for an even 
bigger project on a hilltop a quarter-mile northwest of the first, Edmunds and 
others joined in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 They formed a nonprofit organization called Save Our Mountains Inc. and are in 
a pitched battle with a subsidiary of the Toronto-based Coscan Corp. over 240 
acres on which the company envisions developing 34 estate-size lots. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal has rocked the normally staid community. Opponents collected 
10,000 signatures on a petition asking city officials to halt the project, 
which the developers have promised will not irreparably damage the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the developer is negotiating to sell the land to the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy, which would scuttle the project, the mere idea of 
building something like Brentwood Country Estates has put the fear of 
overdevelopment in people. 
</P>
<P>
 "The development will have a profoundly destructive ecological impact on the 
Santa Monica Mountains," said Edmunds, adding that the project will unearth 
nearly 3 million cubic yards of dirt -- a figure the developers do not dispute. 
"This is an immense project. It can't help but trash the ecosystem." 
</P>
<P>
 The project's proposed design has escalated the controversy. One item under 
dispute is the number of lots that would be located atop the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of different interpretations of density regulations in the area, 
Coscan plans to build either 15 estate sites along Mandeville Canyon Road and 
19 at the top of a hill north of Chalon Road, or put all 34 sites -- 
encompassing three to 15 acres each -- on the mountain peak. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmunds and other critics say they believe zoning restrictions would limit the 
number of lots to 17. 
</P>
<P>
 City planners have not yet formally weighed in on the project. They will begin 
reviewing the plans when Coscon/Davidson submits an environmental impact 
report, which the developer expects to complete by March. 
</P>
<P>
 Another source of dispute is a proposed 200-foot tunnel road designed to bore 
through a hill and emerge onto a corkscrew highway to take drivers to the top 
of the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Coscan/Davidson officials say the tunnel was designed to prevent the mountain 
from being graded for a road. But critics view the tunnel idea as too 
ambitious. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, project manager Andrew Oliver maintains the development will not 
seriously harm the environment, saying that Coscan/Davidson has taken pains to 
be as least disruptive as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he said, of the 240 acres available for development, only 67 
acres will be built upon. Likewise, he said, putting 34 estate lots on top of 
the hill would be environmentally sensitive because the houses would be out of 
view of canyon-dwellers and it would avoid grading along Mandeville Canyon 
Road, which would require ripping out the sides of the hill and installing huge 
retaining walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the opposition is emotional opposition that doesn't give 
consideration to what is being planned," Oliver said. "These proposals were 
very sensitive on our part." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute could be rendered moot if Coscon/Davidson sells the land to the 
conservancy. Coscan/Davidson is trying to work out a deal with the conservancy, 
but the state agency is prohibited by law from paying more than the land's 
appraised value. 
</P>
<P>
 The appraisal was submitted last week to Coscan/Davidson and the conservancy 
but was not made public. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, the good people who want us to go away will allow us to go away 
properly," Oliver said. "We have no intention of selling for anything less than 
what we feel is fair market value." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the developers and homeowners agree on one thing: Brentwood Country 
Estates galvanized opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people I've talked to in (the residents group) and in Mandeville Canyon 
feel that (it) was one they let through," Oliver said. "It gave the opposition 
a chance to go back and reflect on ways they could better oppose us." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Edmunds and other residents remain angry over the presence of 
Brentwood Country Estates. Though the development was finished in late 1991, 
complete with paved roads and sidewalks, so far, no estate lots have been sold. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Only one house, to be built by the partners in the project, is scheduled to go 
up on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodrigo Iglesias, the listing agent for the $2.5-million to $7-million lots, 
blames the recession and the soft real estate market. For many prospective 
buyers, Iglesias said, it's cheaper to buy an existing house rather than 
purchase a lot and then build. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of construction has also put off buyers, who tend to be apprehensive 
about being the first residents in the development. Still, he said, 
"eventually, it will be the most exclusive gated community in Los Angeles."

HOW TRW CAME DOWN TO EARTH; SATELLITES AND CREDIT REPORT ARE THIS 
LITTLE-UNDERSTOOD FIRM'S BEST-KNOWN PRODUCTS. BUT IT IS AUTO PARTS -- 
ESPECIALLY AIR BAGS -- THAT SUSTAIN IT., INDEED, SOME ANALYSTS SAY THE COMPANY 
SHOULD DUMP HIGH-TECH ALTOGETHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Once, TRW was a company that fattened its profit and burnished its reputation 
by helping land American astronauts on the moon. Today, its fortunes ride in 
large part on keeping American motorists from slamming into their dashboards. 
</P>
<P>
 Automotive parts -- especially air bag safety restraints -- are the products 
powering TRW today, though the Cleveland-based conglomerate still fields a 
motley mix of businesses. Its space and defense operation, based in Redondo 
Beach, remains a premier builder of satellites and other spacecraft. Its 
consumer credit-reporting division is headquartered in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, that diversity was considered one of TRW's greatest strengths; its 
fortunes were not tied to any single business or geographic region. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, the wisdom of the mix is being questioned, as the auto industry 
shows new vigor and aerospace continues an unrelenting fade. 
</P>
<P>
 Long gone are the 1980s, when TRW's auto parts and space divisions carried 
nearly equal weight. TRW is now primarily an auto supply company; its white-hot 
sales of air bags, engine valves and other car equipment generate nearly 
two-thirds of its business. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some analysts suggest that now is the time to sell the space or credit 
divisions -- or, perhaps, spin them off. That would cut loose the anchor from 
TRW's fast-moving automotive group and enhance the prospects for the space and 
credit groups themselves, the analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet TRW has no such intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it has embarked on a patient, stay-the-course strategy at a time when 
many of its competitors -- particularly those in the slumping aerospace 
industry -- are trying to reinvent themselves through acquisitions, spinoffs 
and other corporate razzle-dazzle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no present plans for any sort of dismemberment," TRW Chairman Joseph 
T. Gorman said flatly in an interview from Cleveland, where the firm has its 
headquarters. "Our current intention is to continue to run the company as one 
company." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Gorman said, TRW's diversity now has a new purpose. The space and 
credit groups will bolster TRW's automotive division, he said, by providing 
aerospace technology and computer management know-how that can be transferred 
to auto parts production. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is tremendous opportunity for synergy between and among our three 
businesses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 56, Gorman is in his sixth year of what has been a down-and-up ride as 
chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 He assumed the job from the legendary Ruben F. Mettler, a Caltech-trained 
engineer for whom a street is named in Redondo Beach. Mettler retired in 1988 
after 11 years as TRW's chief executive, leaving behind a firm with a unique 
blend of technological sophistication and financial savvy. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, not long after Mettler's departure, TRW ran into deep financial trouble, 
leaving it up to Gorman -- a square-jawed Yale Law School graduate -- to 
engineer a strong rebound that began in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by the sales growth of its air bag systems, TRW's auto parts group 
generated 57% of the company's $8 billion in revenue in 1993. The 
space-and-defense group kicked in 35%, and the credit group and other 
information services provided 8%. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto parts division is expected to keep growing sharply in the years 
ahead, with air bags selling faster than cars themselves, because new autos are 
increasingly coming equipped with two of the inflatable restraints. TRW is the 
only major producer of complete air bag systems, including both the bag and the 
components that do the inflating. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts estimate that TRW's air bag sales approached $1 billion in 1993, up 
nearly 50% from the prior year. (The company does not break out sales by 
product line.) Sales could jump further, to $1.8 billion, over the next three 
years, said Mark B. Johnson, an analyst at Roulston Research Corp., a 
securities firm in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Although second air bags for front-seat passengers won't be mandatory for cars 
until 1997 (and for light trucks the next year), more than 60% of 1994 model 
cars are already coming equipped with dual air bags. 
</P>
<P>
 "The air bag phenomenon has grown faster than even the government expected, 
because safety has become a really hot issue with consumers," said Christopher 
Cedergren, senior vice president of the research firm AutoPacific Group in 
Santa Ana. "That has pushed many manufacturers to offer air bags really before 
they've been mandated, and that's helped TRW tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
 Buoyed by air bag sales, TRW saw a profit of $220 million in 1993, up 14% from 
$194 million the year before (excluding onetime charges related to accounting 
changes), even though overall sales slipped 4% to $7.95 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors like the results. The company's stock price has doubled since 
hitting bottom in 1991. It closed at $72.50 a share Friday in New York Stock 
Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the comeback is hardly complete. 
</P>
<P>
 TRW's credit-reporting and aerospace operations are staring at uncertain 
futures with modest or no growth. And TRW is still earning less on 
stockholders' investment than are rival conglomerates following a similar 
strategy of trying to solve their problems largely from within. 
</P>
<P>
 Two examples: Rockwell International Corp. and AlliedSignal Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Like TRW, both companies have major aerospace and automotive lines. And, like 
TRW, both have used massive layoffs and other means of cost cutting to bolster 
profits in the face of slumping defense budgets, while exploiting the current 
strength of the auto market. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet whereas Rockwell and AlliedSignal last year earned returns on stockholder 
equity of 19.6% and 18.1%, respectively, TRW's return on equity was 14.3%. That 
lagged not only its competitors, but the rate of return TRW itself posted back 
in 1987. (The figures exclude accounting-related charges incurred by all the 
companies.) 
</P>
<P>
 TRW is "just sort of hanging in a respectable manner," said analyst Michael 
Lauer of Kidder, Peabody & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Lauer and other analysts praise Gorman for leading TRW to a solid 
rebound from 1991, when the company was in serious financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 TRW lost $140 million that year on sales of $7.9 billion, as its auto parts 
group was pummeled by the recession and disrupted by an explosion at one of its 
air bag plants. The space group, like other defense contractors, was caught in 
the grip of Pentagon cuts. And TRW's credit-reporting business was not only a 
financial mess, but it had just settled regulators' lawsuits stemming from 
massive errors in consumers' reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all this, TRW's stock price drifted down to the mid-30s, and the 
company's institutional stockholders grumbled. "There was a lot of 
displeasure," said Wayne Nordberg, a partner in Lord Abbett & Co., a New York 
money manager and major TRW stockholder. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gorman restored order. And he put TRW back in the black, cutting nearly 
half its space-and-defense work force -- bringing that sector down to 17,000 
people today -- and shedding several small or poorly performing pieces of its 
information services unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've done a reasonably decent job of cleaning up their businesses," said 
Eli S. Lustgarten, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Herb Dyer, executive director of the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio, 
said his group's ownership of 1.2 million TRW shares reflects its endorsement 
of Gorman's approach.  
</P>
<P>
 Gorman has also maintained TRW's market leadership in several automotive 
markets worldwide -- not just in air bags. The company is a major provider of 
steering and suspension gears, seat belts and engine valves.  
</P>
<P>
 Prospects for TRW's space and credit groups are another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The many layoffs have helped the space group remain profitable despite the 
downturn in defense and NASA spending, and its order backlog remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
 But the division's earnings and sales continue to shrink, despite TRW's work 
on such high-profile defense satellite systems as Milstar (the first satellite 
was launched earlier this month) and the Defense Support Program early-warning 
orbiters. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the space group's operating profit and sales dropped for the third 
straight year, to $205 million (excluding accounting charges) and $2.8 billion, 
respectively. Kidder Peabody's Lauer predicts the space group will see its 
share of TRW's overall operating profit dwindle to about 20% by 1996, from more 
than 50% in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The division's problems -- and even the suggestion that the division should be 
unloaded -- are particularly painful for TRW, because its roots are in space. 
</P>
<P>
 The company began in a Los Angeles barber shop in 1953. Two Caltech graduates, 
Simon Ramo and Dean Wooldridge, opened for business after leaving Howard 
Hughes' fledgling Hughes Aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair hoped to speed the development of a missile system they had devised. 
And they were quickly rewarded in the mid-1950s, when Ramo-Wooldridge Corp. was 
tapped to oversee the nation's development of a ballistic missile system to 
counter the Soviet Union's nuclear threat. 
</P>
<P>
 After merging with auto parts maker Thompson Products Inc. in Cleveland, the 
new TRW began winning satellite and space vehicle contracts as the Space Age 
flourished in the 1960s. When man first landed on the moon in 1969, it was a 
TRW engine that gently lowered Apollo 11's lunar module onto the Sea of 
Tranquillity. 
</P>
<P>
 TRW attracted some of the nation's brightest scientists and engineers, drawn 
by the challenges of the early space and missile programs and California's 
allure. 
</P>
<P>
 The company became a premier maker of spy and telecommunications satellites 
and other spacecraft -- it has built more than 180 to date -- including Pioneer 
10 and 11, which provided the first close-up looks of Jupiter and Saturn. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, TRW went on a diversification binge, getting into such areas as 
oil field drilling equipment, electronic components and its credit-reporting 
service. But by the mid-1980s, the firm began unloading many of those lines to 
focus on the three divisions it has today. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorman said he is confident the space group's shrinkage can be reversed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our productivity has improved dramatically" in the aftermath of the layoffs, 
he said. "We've reduced the bureaucracy, we've reduced layers of management. I 
believe we can grow it from here." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, counters analyst Lauer. "I disagree with the management that revenue 
with space and defense will commence a recovery," he said. "It will decline." 
</P>
<P>
 But the space division could grow, Lauer asserted -- if it were uncoupled from 
the company, much as Litton Industries Inc. is about to separate its defense 
business from its commercial operations -- or if the division had its own 
separate stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter step was taken by General Motors Corp. a decade ago when it sold 
shares in its Hughes Aircraft and Electronic Data Systems units but kept 
control of the units. The move enabled Hughes and EDS to raise cash and map 
their own futures outside GM. 
</P>
<P>
 Lauer said TRW's space group could use the same method to acquire other firms, 
enter new ventures and pursue other steps that its parent company would 
probably skip because they would detract from its robust auto group, Lauer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's all moot for Gorman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have absolutely no intention -- let me make myself very clear -- no 
intention whatsoever to sell our space-and-defense business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the credit-reporting division, "we have no current plans to sell that 
business, either," Gorman said, even though analysts don't see the division 
contributing much more to TRW's overall results in the next few years than it 
currently does. 
</P>
<P>
 The credit group has gradually been rebuilding its sales and profit after 
slashing costs and eliminating the errors and mismanagement that prompted the 
lawsuits and regulatory clampdown in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hadn't paid enough attention, frankly, to the nitty-gritty details of 
making certain that our quality was high enough," Gorman said. "On top of that, 
the (division's) cost structure had become bloated." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "We have fixed (the division) in terms of quality and service." 
</P>
<P>
 Fixes, in fact, are becoming the TRW way. Although the company has frequently 
dumped troubled assets in the past, TRW now plans to keep what it has, 
rehabilitate those operations that are struggling and hope they prosper on 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt we could create much more long-term value for the patient shareholder 
by fixing the businesses," Gorman said. "I think we have done that. We're happy 
with our performance." Reasonable Returns from a High-Tech Smorgasbord 
</P>
<P>
 After a dismal showing in 1991, TRW's profits are climbing again despite lower 
sales. But the company still has not achieved the same high yield on its 
stockholders' investment that it enjoyed seven years ago.

TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS: 'MAINFRAME RENAISSANCE' IS REALLY THE REVENGE OF THE

<P>
 Is the mainframe computer back in style? 
</P>
<P>
 It seems a ridiculous question to ask in this day and age. IBM, the leader in 
mainframe computing forever, has seen its sales of mainframes cut nearly in 
half over the past five years. Sales of its minicomputers, in which it is also 
the market leader, declined for the first time last year by about 10%. Other 
mainframe or minicomputer companies are either dying or stagnant.

 Nonetheless, the corporate keepers of computing argue that mainframes are 
roaring back. My colleague at Computerworld, Editor-in-Chief Bill Laberis, 
wrote an editorial a few weeks ago titled "Big Box Redux." 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems that after suffering through the dark ages of hyperbole, 
overselling, misrepresentation and outright fraud," he wrote, "users are now 
being sung a different tune by vendors, analysts and others about client-server 
computing and the real world." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, you can observe -- at gatherings of people who manage corporate 
computer systems -- a kind of growing ebullience, a sense that the world has 
come to its senses and will let the computer managers once again do their jobs 
as they should. 
</P>
<P>
 The fortunes of the mainframe computer are a kind of analog for the balance of 
power between the keepers of computing inside large companies and the users of 
computing -- executives, owners, managers and workers. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, between about 1965 and 1985, the non-technical people in 
corporations were held hostage by the technical people. Mainframes and 
minicomputers were so expensive, so difficult to comprehend, so unrelated to 
the skills of managing the functional areas of a company, that the people who 
knew how to run them could affect the most basic fortunes of the company. And 
the functional managers weren't able to tell how they did it. 
</P>
<P>
 The classic case of this occurred when American Airlines' computer people 
figured out how to make all the reservations on their computers, thereby taking 
control of an entire industry's ability to record its transactions with 
customers. American's "Sabre" system has been cited repeatedly as an example of 
how information was becoming a functional area itself, rather than just a 
service for the other functions in the company. It was enough to make the 
non-computer people feel like the computer people were taking over the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 So this question of the status of the mainframe can be pretty important. The 
power of computing officials has been declining along with their big, 
centralized computers. In job surveys, "chief information officer" ranks as the 
most unstable position in executive ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no wonder then that after more than a decade of being roughed up by the 
chaos of millions of personal computers, computer managers want to believe they 
are getting back in control. 
</P>
<P>
 The change that lets them believe this is the arrival of "client-server 
computing," which has transmogrified from a description of a particular kind of 
computing into a kind of clarion call for what Computerworld's Laberis calls "a 
more structured mainframe mentality." Others might describe it as a call for 
returning to Soviet-style, centralized control of information processing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, mainframe computers were controlled by terminals attached to 
the central processing unit by wires. The rise of personal computers 
represented a real problem for corporate computing managers, because PCs 
weren't attached to anything and could be controlled by individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Then groups in corporate departments started linking PCs together to keep 
track of small pieces of information that hadn't been important enough to 
manage on mainframes or minicomputers. The groups started to link each other 
together into loose networks of networks, often for the purpose of using 
electronic mail. 
</P>
<P>
 By last year, most big companies had launched some kind of formal effort to 
begin to integrate all of these networks and all of their mainframe systems 
into a single integrated system. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter client-server computing. 
</P>
<P>
 The original idea of client-server computing was to describe the notion that, 
in a larger system, you would have large and small computers cooperating with 
each other, as "clients" requesting services and "servers" providing services. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was to differentiate this kind of computing from the old kind of 
computing -- described as "host-terminal" or, more appropriately, master-slave. 
Servers and clients are supposed to cooperate and spread the computing around 
the system in a perfect digital representation of a kind of free-enterprise 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In their attempt to regain some semblance of control over the fortunes of the 
company at large, the corporate computing officials are now looking at 
client-server computing as their salvation. They see a vast sea of wires 
connecting together all those obstreperous personal computers -- and they 
believe they can once again gain control of the computing resources of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 What they fail to recognize is that client-server computing is actually the 
ultimate revenge of the non-technical managers. 
</P>
<P>
 All the economic pressures are for vendors to build small, inexpensive 
components that can be plugged into these vast information systems by anybody 
-- even those without serious technical training. The portion of the system 
that will be managed by the computing officials will inevitably become a 
smaller piece of the whole pie. And the functional managers of the company will 
gain increasing control over the resources they need -- whether to design and 
manufacture products, to market and distribute them or to manage the operations 
of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The mainframe may look like it's back in style. But it won't be long before it 
becomes clear that 1994 was just the last gasp of a dying technology.

A LITANY OF COMPLAINTS IN THE BOOMING FRANCHISE INDUSTRY; UNHAPPY STORIES SPAWN 
CALLS FOR TOUGHER REGULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON and SUSAN CHRISTIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sports writer Cary Koegle had spent more than half his life working for 
someone else, but the newspaper journeyman from Bellflower always wanted to be 
his own boss. 
</P>
<P>
 So in 1991, Koegle retired early from the Pasadena Star News, cashed in his 
employee savings plan and went shopping for a business. At a franchise trade 
show in Anaheim, the Sign-A-Rama booth caught his eye. After investing $30,000 
in a franchise, Koegle and his two sons opened a sign-making outlet in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 But Koegle's dream faded as the business faltered. His financial woes 
worsened, and he was forced to sell his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Last January -- on moving day -- Koegle had a heart attack. Two days later, 
the 48-year-old was dead. His son places part of the blame on stress from the 
failed business. "He knew he had been naive," Charles Koegle said. "He felt 
very depressed." 
</P>
<P>
 The Koegles' is one of many unhappy stories in the booming franchise industry. 
The complaints have grown so loud that state and federal regulators are 
considering an overhaul of franchise laws that in many cases have not been 
updated in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomers to the business -- which now counts more than 558,000 franchise 
units -- aren't the only ones with complaints: 
</P>
<P>
 * Richard L. Cohn, a Chicago businessman who has owned Taco Bell franchises 
since 1983, alleged in an August lawsuit that Irvine-based Taco Bell engaged a 
corporate spy in an attempt to drive him out of business. Taco Bell denies the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Also last summer, a frustrated franchisee of Anaheim-based Carl Karcher 
Enterprises sued the company for willfully misleading him on the value of a 
dozen Carl's Jr. restaurant franchises in Arizona. What made the suit unusual 
was that the plaintiff was Frank Karcher, the company's former vice president 
of franchising and a brother of founder Carl N. Karcher. The suit eventually 
was dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Late last month, Ventura County residents Alexander and Sabrina Shin filed 
suit against Karcher Enterprises in Santa Ana Superior Court, alleging that the 
company misled them on the value of eight restaurants they purchased in 1990. 
They contend the firm fraudulently assured them that the Northern California 
restaurants were likely to turn a profit, even though a company study indicated 
that they would lose money. A Karcher spokesman declined comment on the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Militant franchise holders have formed two trade groups to lobby legislators 
and exchange information. 
</P>
<P>
 Franchisers offer their own litany of complaints about the 
$803-billion-per-year industry, whose rapid growth has transformed the way 
people eat, shop and work. Many companies say longstanding franchisees won't 
acknowledge a dramatic change in consumer buying patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole industry has changed," said Jonathan Blum, spokesman for Taco 
Bell, which is alienating some franchisees by selling its Mexican-style fast 
food through a growing array of unconventional outlets, including kiosks, carts 
and grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Other franchisers argue that agreements signed decades ago are woefully out of 
date. "We're trying to ensure that we don't become tomorrow's Hula Hoop, and 
(franchisees) aren't willing to help," fretted one franchising executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislators and regulators in California and beyond want to settle the feud. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Rep. John J. LaFalce (D-N.Y.) has introduced three bills that would force 
franchisers to make fuller financial disclosures and otherwise bolster 
protection for franchisees. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, State Sen. Steve Peace (D-Chula Vista) last month introduced 
legislation that would allow California-based operators to sue out-of-state 
franchisers in state courts rather than having to file in the franchiser's home 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of states are reviewing a groundbreaking law passed in Iowa last year 
that established what proponents call a "franchisee bill of rights." A federal 
court struck down part of the Iowa legislation, and franchisees lost a 
hard-fought battle last year for similar protection in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 But "franchisees tasted blood in Iowa, and they're going after the same 
protection elsewhere in the country," said Susan Kezios, president of the newly 
formed American Franchisee Assn. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 While legislators consider new laws and franchisers offer proposals for 
self-regulation, franchising continues to flourish -- especially in the retail, 
restaurant, and home and office service sectors. The International Franchise 
Assn. projects that total franchise sales will hit $1 trillion by the year 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Franchising is an especially appealing alternative for people who have lost 
jobs with big companies -- or who start businesses on the side in anticipation 
of being laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 There's certainly no shortage of opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 The cover of Irvine-based Entrepreneur magazine's January issue boasts that in 
California alone there are "over 777" different franchise opportunities. The 
magazine is chock-full of ads that promise financial security, big money and 
unlimited income -- including one from a Mississippi company that for $599 
offers entry to the "$12-billion a year untouched market (for) renewing tennis 
shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 But the dramatic growth is generating controversy. In California, complaints 
"have definitely been on the uprise in the last couple of years -- partly 
because of the proliferation of franchise trade shows that target all the 
people who have been laid off from work," said Judy Hartley, a lawyer for the 
state Department of Corporations.  
</P>
<P>
 The International Franchise Assn. urges consumers to "do their homework, to 
check with lawyers and accountants," said spokesman Andy Trincia. "We are 
always telling people that if it seems to be too good to be true, then it 
probably is."  
</P>
<P>
 Dean Sagar, economist for the House Committee on Small Business, notes that "a 
whole franchise industry developed in the mid-1980s -- enormous chains were set 
up merely to sell franchises. Unlike the established franchisers, such as 
McDonald's, these new franchisers (don't) have a proven concept." 
</P>
<P>
 Some established franchisees, dealers and distributors also are grumbling 
about what they perceive as shabby treatment from their longtime corporate 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
 A growing concern is encroachment on a license holder's territory by other 
franchisees -- or the company itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Yorba Linda resident Danny Stone, who operates a Snap-On Tools franchise, 
complains that the Wisconsin-based company has shrunk his territory in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like having a gym floor that takes one guy an hour to sweep: You could 
hire three more guys, cut everyone's salary and get the job done in 15 
minutes," said Stone, 42. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Clark, Snap-On's director of franchise operations, defended the 
Wisconsin-based company's decision to cut back Stone's previous territory to 
225 customers from 300. "If you call on your customers once a week, there's no 
human way you could service more than that," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the country, newly militant franchisees are banding together. After 
just more than a year, the American Franchisee Assn. claims 13,000 franchised 
locations under its umbrella, including holders of Taco Bell, Dunkin' Donuts 
and Jack in the Box franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 Another organization, the San Diego-based American Assn. of Franchisees & 
Dealers, says its charter is "providing a counterbalance in the franchising 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
 The emergence of those groups hasn't gone unnoticed by the International 
Franchise Assn., long the industry's dominant trade group. Last year, the IFA 
took the unprecedented step of inviting franchisees to join the organization. 
The 33-year-old IFA, which represents most of the biggest franchise names, also 
created a voluntary dispute-resolution program and crafted what its officials 
describe as a tough professional code of ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 "By and large, the vast majority of franchisees are happy and making money, 
but there are some who aren't happy, and there's enough dissension that the 
board of directors recognized that it's time for more teamwork," spokesman 
Trincia said. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials at the newly formed franchisee organization question whether the 
IFA's invitation to franchisees is sincere. 
</P>
<P>
 Flexing its new-found muscle, the American Franchise Assn. anheld its first 
national meeting in Las Vegas last week -- on the same days that the IFA held 
its annual meeting. The Most Popular Franchises 
</P>
<P>
 Franchises accounted for more than $803 billion in 1992 retail sales -- 35% of 
all retail sales in the United States. They employ 8 million people -- an 
average of eight to 14 per establishment. Here is a list of the most popular 
categories of "business format" franchises, those that offer franchisees a 
complete system of doing business. 
</P>
<P>
 Franchise Sales in billions: Restaurants: $85.5 Non-food retailing: $31.4 
Hotels, motels: $26.0 Business services: $20.8 Auto products, services: $15.4 
Convenience stores: $15.0 Retail food (non-convenience): $12.1 Auto-truck 
rental: $8.0 Construction, home improvement: $7.1 Recreation: $4.8

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: SOMETIMES BUYING IS CHEAPER THAN RENTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ed and Blythe Tellefsen thought they'd never be able to afford a Southern 
California home. But thanks to low interest rates and the state's nagging real 
estate slump, they recently purchased a three-bedroom house in La Crescenta. 
</P>
<P>
 Their mortgage payment is comparable to what they'd pay to rent the same 
house, Ed says. That proved a compelling argument to buy, even for longtime 
renters. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar scenes are being played out nationwide as depressed home prices and 
low interest rates combine to push mortgage payments down to levels that are at 
or below rental costs in many areas -- a phenomenon not seen in recent memory, 
if ever, according to realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, when housing prices are soft and interest rates are low, rents also 
drop, which tends to keep rent payments below mortgage payments for comparable 
residences. However, that pattern reversed recently because the residential 
rental market has remained fairly tight, even while the housing market 
languished, realtors say. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California's earthquake, which destroyed or rendered unlivable 
thousands of rental units, tightened the rental market further. The result is 
that rents have remained steady or climbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Largely as a result of improving economics for buying compared to renting, 
first-time home buyers are flooding the market, realtors say. Nearly 4.5 
million new homes sold nationwide in 1993 -- the best year for housing since 
1979. Sales were particular strong in November and December, which historically 
are slow months for real estate. And agents say would-be buyers are still 
flocking to their seminars for first-time home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason boils down to dollars and cents. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look through the computer listing for Orange County (home sales), you 
could pull up any number of properties where the mortgage rate would be less or 
equal to the rental rate in the same area," says Pat Neal, a Garden Grove 
realtor and president of the California Assn. of Realtors in Los Angeles. "This 
is a tremendous window of opportunity for somebody to get into a home." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 * Two Burbank townhomes were recently advertised -- one for sale, the other 
for rent. Both are in security buildings and feature two bedrooms and 2 1/2 
baths. The one for sale was listed at $154,000. Assuming the buyer put down 20% 
of that and secured a loan at 7% interest, the monthly payment would be about 
$980. 
</P>
<P>
 The advertised price for the rental was $1,050 a month -- $70 a month more. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Clearwater, Fla., it costs roughly $800 a month to rent a three-bedroom 
apartment, brokers say. But you could buy a comparable three-bedroom house for 
$100,000, or $650 a month, saving $150 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Denver, a three-bedroom home costs $115,000 -- about $740 a month -- 
which is just slightly less than the $750 average rental rate for a comparable 
residence, says Barry Miller, president of Buyer's Resource, a franchised real 
estate service for buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Home buyers also receive substantial tax benefits that renters don't get 
because mortgage interest and property taxes are deductible. 
</P>
<P>
 To illustrate how that plays out, let's assume the buyers of the Burbank 
townhome are a husband and wife who earn $50,000 annually, pay $1,500 in state 
taxes, $1,500 in property taxes and give $1,000 annually to charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they're buying a house, they'll itemize tax deductions for the first 
time. In the end, they save about $1,500 in federal income tax and about $400 
in state income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the tax savings and the lower housing costs, they have $227 a month 
more than the renters. However, the renters have $30,800 more in the bank -- 
the amount of the buyers' down payment. 
</P>
<P>
 If the renters paid the same rent for the next 30 years and kept that $30,000 
invested, earning 10% a year, they would have $603,763 saved at the end of the 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 If the buyers invested their $227 monthly savings in a mutual fund earning 10% 
a year, they would own their home and still have an investment portfolio worth 
$508,772. 
</P>
<P>
 If the home's value did not increase at all over the next 30 years, the buyers 
would still end up with total assets worth $662,772 -- some $59,000 more than 
the renters. If their home appreciated at a modest 2% average annual rate, they 
would end up $185,000 richer than the renters. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the numbers don't always pencil out so neatly. Some realtors 
maintain that the buy-versus-rent equation works in favor of buyers when they 
purchase modest homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the grander the residence, the less likely it is that a mortgage would be 
cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the rental market is soft in some communities where there has been 
adequate building and modest population growth. For example, in Beverly, Mass. 
-- a Boston suburb -- it costs roughly $750 a month to rent a three-bedroom 
home, while it costs about $130,000 -- roughly $835 a month -- to buy, Miller 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 With tax benefits, the buyers still may have a slight edge, using the same 
assumptions as before. But the house would have to appreciate by 3.5% or more 
annually before the buyers would come out ahead in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, if you're renting a fairly sizable apartment or house, you ought 
to start crunching the numbers, realtors say. There's a good chance you'd be 
better off with a mortgage.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: TAX TIP: DON'T TOUCH 401(K) FUNDS! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. I recently got a new job. My previous employer offered a 401(k) plan; my 
new employer does not. What should I do with the money from my old 401(k) plan 
when the funds are disbursed? Is there anything I can do to defer paying taxes 
on the money? -- A.W . 
</P>
<P>
 A. To avoid immediate taxation, you should transfer the proceeds in your old 
employer's 401(k) plan to a tax-deferred individual retirement account. Those 
proceeds and the accumulated interest will be taxable when you withdraw them. 
</P>
<P>
 The transfer from the 401(k) plan to the IRA must be made in strict accordance 
with federal regulations. Under rules effective last year, taxpayers cashing 
out of a former employer's 401(k) or other qualified pension plan must have 
that money transferred directly -- trustee to trustee -- to a qualified IRA. If 
the taxpayer takes possession of the money -- even to make the transfer -- he 
will be slapped with 20% withholding on the disbursement. Even if the taxpayer 
puts the pension money in an IRA himself within the allowed 60 days, the 20% 
tax still applies. 
</P>
<P>
 To repeat: To avoid the tax, you must not take possession of the money. 
Rather, have the trustee of your 401(k) plan transfer it directly to the 
trustee of the IRA you establish for the funds. This isn't hard, but it does 
require planning. Equity May Improve Mortgage Eligibility 
</P>
<P>
 Q. My father recently died and left his home to my brother and me. I would 
like to buy my brother's half from him but don't have enough cash. How can I 
get a loan? I am a renter now and want to move into the house. -- R.C.M . 
</P>
<P>
 A. Although you could certainly approach any commercial mortgage lender, your 
best bet may be to ask your brother to carry the note. After you and he agree 
on a purchase price, loan terms and interest rate, you would simply pay him 
every month just as though you were paying rent. Of course, you would need to 
have the appropriate documents executed and recorded, clearly delineating the 
scope and terms of the purchase and loan. 
</P>
<P>
 If your brother wants his cash now, you will be forced to seek a commercial 
loan. But because you already own 50% of the home, you should be asking for a 
"cash-out refinancing." And because you already have 50% equity in the 
property, you should find many large mortgage lenders inclined to relax the 
usual income qualifying standard. Because you are purchasing only half the 
house, the most you would need to borrow would be 50% of its fair market value. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the following examples from Countrywide Funding, the nation's largest 
mortgage maker: A borrower is seeking a 30-year, fixed-rate loan of $78,000 at 
7.25%. With just a 20% equity stake in the home, he would need a monthly income 
of $2,500 to qualify for the loan. However, if the borrower already owns 50% of 
the home, has an unblemished credit history and no other outstanding consumer 
debt, he could get the loan while earning as little as $1,800 to $2,000 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there are no guarantees here. Most lenders will not make a loan if 
housing costs -- including principal, interest, taxes and insurance -- exceed 
36% of the borrower's income. The adage that equity does not repay a loan still 
applies. You must have sufficient income to show a lender you can repay the 
loan and still have enough left over to cover living expenses. Thrift Takeover 
Rules Allow Rates to Be Cut 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Several years ago, we put $99,000 into a certificate of deposit with a 
local savings and loan that promised to pay 9.25% interest for five years. 
Halfway into the term, the thrift collapsed and was taken over by the 
government. Another S&L took over operations and immediately cut the interest 
rate on our CD to 4.58%. Is there anything we can do about it? We thought we 
had a contract. -- W.C.W . 
</P>
<P>
 A. In order to entice healthy thrift institutions to take over ailing ones, 
the Resolution Trust Corp. allows the acquiring thrift to lower the interest it 
pays on depositors' accounts to match current rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Most ailing institutions were paying interest far above prevailing rates 
in order to attract deposits. This trapped them in a vicious circle of having 
to attract new money in order to cover their obligations to existing 
depositors. In an effort to break the cycle, the RTC allows thrifts taking over 
ailing institutions to bring depositor interest rates back into line with 
prevailing market conditions. In fact, the RTC allows them to pay as little as 
the prevailing savings passbook rate on assumed deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is any consolation, there are thousands of depositors just like you, 
forced to pay for the sins of high-flying thrift operators who stumbled and 
took their institutions down with them.

<P>
 By the way, in case you are wondering, you are not allowed to deduct the 
interest you would have earned if your account had not been assumed as an 
investment loss. 
</P>
<P>
 We've been asked this question before and had to remind readers that you can't 
deduct something you never had. Settlement Excluded From Taxable Income 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I am 75 years old and drawing Social Security. Last year, I received a 
wrongful-death settlement from the owners of the nursing home where my mother 
fell to her death from a fourth-floor window. Must I include this settlement in 
my modified adjusted gross income for calculating the taxable portion of our 
Social Security benefits? -- H.S.F . 
</P>
<P>
 A. Insurance settlements of the type you describe are not subject to income 
tax and are not included in gross income when calculating the taxable portion 
of Social Security benefits.

A.M.E. CHURCH IS A VOICE IN SOUTH COUNTY 'WILDERNESS'; RELIGION: AN UNLIKELY 
MINISTRY ABOVE AN IRVINE BOWLING ALLEY HELPS UNIFY A SMALL AND DISPERSED 
AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. 
</P>

 One floor removed from the rumble of bowling balls and the crack of tenpins 
lies the quaint little chapel of Irvine Lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 No steeple marks the church of Christ Our Redeemer African Methodist 
Episcopal, which also lacks a public sign or even a listing in the phone book. 
Yet its windowless, second-story sanctuary is filled with a young flock singing 
"We Shall Overcome" while struggling to ignore the occasional faint scent of 
sweat socks and old beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a year ago, this infant congregation had dwindled to the size of the 
original apostles, a chorus of voices so faint that the forlorn music made the 
church pianist want to weep. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came a preacher from Los Angeles with a mission to build up the lone 
black church in the sprawling southern suburbs of Orange County, where the 
scattered and isolated African American population had long ago lost its heart 
and center in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we're meeting in a bowling alley," observed the new church 
pastor, the Rev. Douglas M. Patterson Sr., "we're still in a place of worship. 
We have our prayer and we realize God can come to us in any place." 
</P>
<P>
 God may find them anywhere, but this is the only place among tranquil suburban 
neighborhoods and grassy office parks where black church members can glance 
around the room, see others like themselves, and greet each other without 
introduction as "Sister" or "Brother." 
</P>
<P>
 Here they are the majority at the Christ Our Redeemer church, which has 
managed to flourish despite the unheavenly ambience of bowling balls and 
strikes, a history of internal dissension and meager resources, and the 
difficulties of reaching out to a small, widely dispersed black population. 
</P>
<P>
 When they walk past the bowlers on the first floor and climb the flight of 
stairs to Redeemer's door, they leave behind a suburban world that is 
occasionally lonely, often friendly and sometimes hostile to the 42,000 black 
residents who make up a little more than 2% of Orange County's population. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came from a big Los Angeles church where we had some 10,000 members, three 
services a day," Patterson said. "Then I come here about a year ago to Orange 
County, to a church where there are 12 people, no piano and no choir." 
</P>
<P>
 Two centuries ago, Richard Allen, the original founder of the African 
Methodist Episcopal Church, launched the worldwide denomination from a 
Philadelphia blacksmith's shop with an anvil for an altar. 
</P>
<P>
 So, too, has Patterson improvised, with taped music and a donated piano, 
borrowed chairs and a portable communion rail, fund-raisers and charity appeals 
featuring his own "spiritual father," his former ministerial boss. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, Patterson will slip in his sermons, referring to the hymnals 
stored in "your pews" -- actually padded chairs. But like Patterson, members 
overlook these earthly matters of style, ignoring the fact that their church's 
most distinctive architectural feature is fluorescent lights instead of arched 
stained glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow Patterson's steady baritone singing voice and generous ration of hugs 
seemed to transform a bowling alley conference room into a community for a 
people searching for haven. His comforting words made awkward newcomers relax. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are at home here," he said, stretching both hands toward two strangers. 
"You are ours. You are from here." 
</P>
<P>
 At the 11 a.m. Sunday service, Patterson bounded into the conference room with 
a bright orange kente cloth hanging loosely against his black robes and a crisp 
white handkerchief in his hand. His smile never wavered as he intoned the words 
of the National Negro Hymn, "Lift Every Voice and Sing," urging the nearly 40 
worshipers to extend a handshake in greeting to their seatmates. 
</P>
<P>
 More often they embraced. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, the A.M.E. network has provided shelter for the black community 
since the original church, Mother Bethel, was a northern way station for slaves 
seeking escape in the caves and basements of the Underground Railroad. Noted 
black historian and educator W.E.B. DuBois once called the African Methodist 
Episcopal churches "by longest odds the vastest and most remarkable product of 
American Negro civilisation." 
</P>
<P>
 Vanessa Ashford Bussey, a recent Irvine transplant whose family boasts three 
generations of South Carolina A.M.E. ministers, offers a one-word description: 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I found the church in Irvine, I was so happy, being a traditional 
Southerner," said Bussey, 35. "The warmth of the church made a big difference. 
For one thing, it let me know there were more African Americans in the area. I 
had seen some here and there, but scattered. Just worshiping made a difference 
to be among other African Americans. It gives you a sense of belonging. I found 
African American friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Many church members had made a Sunday habit of commuting to black churches in 
Santa Ana, Long Beach, Los Angeles or San Diego until they found Irvine Lanes 
through friends or community advertisements in the Black Orange calender. New 
church member Karen Mizell would drop off her two daughters at a church with a 
white congregation near their Irvine home. But she always politely declined 
invitations to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "That church is great," she said, "but I couldn't bring myself to go. I've 
never gone to white churches. I don't know if that should make a difference, 
but it does." 
</P>
<P>
 A West Virginia native, Mizell grew up in the Baptist church with the rituals 
and gospel music that for centuries have provided a spiritual and cultural 
anchor for black worshipers. When she moved to Southern California from West 
Virginia four years ago, she immediately started searching for her community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of hard," Mizell remembered. "The first thing I wanted to do was 
to go to the black side of town. And my brother laughed at me. He said there's 
no such thing. It was like I had to get a shot. I had to be around my people." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 11-story office building where she works as a contract administrator in 
the Koll Center, there are only three other black employees. They immediately 
connected, "holding on to each other," as Mizell puts it. Her daughters have 
mostly white friends because there are few black students in their school. And 
so the girls immediately noticed color when they entered the doors of Christ 
Our Redeemer church. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'Mom, there's no white people,' " Mizell remembered. "And I said, 
'It's because it's a black church.' And they asked me, 'What's a black church?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 The roots of Christ Our Redeemer date back to 1991 when another A.M.E. 
minister, Linda Parker, started meeting on the campus of UC Irvine with black 
students seeking a church. That meeting quickly grew into a spiritual community 
of some 75 regulars who moved from a campus building to the conference room 
above the Irvine Lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came a period of internal strife and dissension that even today 
diplomatic members blame on a variety of vague difficulties: "personality 
clashes," problems with administration, the sex of the founding minister, a 
debate over the size and goals of the church. 
</P>
<P>
 By late summer of 1992, the church had dwindled to a loyal core of 12 whose 
resolve to stay together was as hard as a bowling ball. For nearly four months 
they worshiped together without a minister. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that a number of judgments were made that did not work out and the 
result was a personality clash," said A.M.E. Bishop Vinton Randolph Anderson, 
who presides over the church's Fifth District, which includes Irvine. "People 
also didn't have a great amount of stock in a room above a bowling alley. So 
they scattered. Had it been a church with its own building, they may not have 
deserted." 
</P>
<P>
 So Anderson shifted Patterson, a former associate minister at the prominent 
First A.M.E. church of Los Angeles, to Irvine to make sure the black church 
kept its stake in South County. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, the church regenerated by worshipers of twos and threes, partly with 
the inspiration of Patterson's energetic preaching and partly with the gentle 
prodding of existing members who personally call every new visitor to invite 
them back. If the new visitors lack transportation, the members pick them up. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, the congregation has been cautiously considering the notion of moving 
to a real church, perhaps sharing quarters with a Seventh-day Adventist church 
where members hold services on Saturdays. The price of Irvine real estate is so 
high that Patterson estimates it could cost from $1.5 million to $3 million to 
actually buy a church. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the congregation of Christ Our Redeemer will continue to 
share praying space with bowling balls. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all," noted the bishop, "most of us forget that our mothers and fathers 
began their churches in their homes, in their dining rooms, in their living 
rooms. That's where the churches really began."

MISSION VIEJO MAY GET OUT OF LIBRARY SYSTEM; POLITICS: CITY OFFICIALS SAY ITS 
FACILITY IS SOUTHLAND'S WORST. THEY WANT COUNTY TO EITHER BUILD A NEW ONE OR 
HAND OVER FUNDS COLLECTED FROM CITY TAXPAYERS. 
</P>

 City officials say this planned community might become the first city to 
secede from the Orange County library system now that a new report confirms 
what many residents have been saying for years: that the local branch library 
is the worst in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also states that at least $4.5 million in tax revenue from Mission 
Viejo residents has been spent to support other county libraries, a contention 
that is disputed by county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a whole generation of children in Mission Viejo who are growing up 
without a decent library, and we can't permit that to happen," City Councilman 
Robert D. Breton said.  
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has called a special meeting for Wednesday to discuss the 
possibility of separating Mission Viejo's library from the 27-branch county 
library system, which has cut back operating hours countywide because of budget 
troubles in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 No one, including county officials, disputes that the Mission Viejo branch 
library is woefully undersized. Built in 1972 when the community had a 
population of 15,000, the 9,155-square-foot building now serves 82,000 Mission 
Viejo residents and another 24,000 in Laguna Hills, Aliso Viejo and Leisure 
World. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials say they are willing to sell the current building and 
contribute the proceeds -- about $1 million -- to building a new branch 
library. But efforts to start the library project have bogged down over the 
county officials' contention that they won't be solely responsible for 
constructing libraries in incorporated cities. 
</P>
<P>
 A city-commissioned library report released Friday showed that most of the 
Mission Viejo library's problems relate directly to lack of space. The report 
found that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Only 49 programs for children were held last year, none for adults. The 
average for a library in a community the size of Mission Viejo is 317 programs 
for adults and children. 
</P>
<P>
 * The state standard for libraries is one-half square foot per community 
resident. The county's benchmark is two-tenths of a square foot. In Mission 
Viejo, the library is about half the county standard. 
</P>
<P>
 * The branch has only 34 parking spaces, including staff parking. Patrons 
often park several hundred feet down the street or circle the building, waiting 
for someone to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 * The 22-year-old building is not fitted for new technology that many 
libraries now have. 
</P>
<P>
 "It cannot accommodate modern technology," said Barbara Pearson, the head 
librarian in El Segundo who compiled the report. 
</P>
<P>
 And too often, city officials say, books gather dust in storage areas because 
there is no more room on the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 After Pearson gave a verbal preview of the report last week, Councilwoman 
Sharon Cody turned to the consultant and asked: "In your opinion, is this the 
worst library in the Southland?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson replied, "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before incorporating in 1988, Mission Viejo has pressed the county to 
build a new library. The city has spent $2.5 million to buy land for a library 
and commissioned drawings for a 25,000-square-foot building at La Paz Road and 
Marguerite Parkway that will cost an estimated $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a Mission Viejo ballot proposal to sell bonds to pay for the building 
was rejected by residents in 1992. Although 56% of voters approved the measure, 
the initiative needed a two-thirds vote to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials have agreed to sell the current library building on Chrisanta 
Road and apply the money to the project. But hit with a 34% cut in state 
revenue last year, the embattled county library system doesn't have enough 
money to be responsible for building libraries in incorporated communities, 
library officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county has been willing for some time to participate in the building of a 
library" in Mission Viejo, County Librarian John Adams said Friday. "However, 
the city is under the perception that the county has an obligation to building 
a library in an incorporated community. That has not been our policy." 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials say the report shows residents have already paid for 
another library. 
</P>
<P>
 A supplemental report compiled by city staff shows that Mission Viejo 
taxpayers have contributed $4.5 million to a special county fund since 1988.  
</P>
<P>
 The county "has been using Mission Viejo taxpayers' money to subsidize their 
other libraries," said Councilman Breton, who also sits on the city library 
committee. "We do believe they have an obligation to build a new library." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Adams said the special fund also is used for flood control and fire 
service. In recent years, the County Board of Supervisors has channeled the 
money into the County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how the supervisors have prioritized the special district funds," 
Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Mission Viejo secedes from the library system depends on whether 
county officials can be convinced to turn over Mission Viejo tax revenue to the 
city, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers in cities that don't run their own libraries pay into a library 
district administered by the county. Property owners also were taxed for the 
special fund until July, when the fund was eliminated by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they might be able to legally gain control of the portion 
of library district funds paid by Mission Viejo taxpayers, but admit that it's 
a gray legal area. 
</P>
<P>
 The city and county also differ on the costs of running the Mission Viejo 
branch. According to Adams, Mission Viejo taxpayers paid about $800,000 into 
the library system during the 1992-93 budget year, while operating costs for 
the local branch ran just over $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 However, city figures received from the county accounting office show that 
about $980,000 was paid into the library district by Mission Viejo taxpayers 
during that period. The consultant estimated the branch could be run for 
$837,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Four Mission Viejo council members have said they favor taking over the 
branch, but not without tax revenue to pay operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd have to be very cautious about taking over the library," Councilman 
William S. Craycraft said. "We'd have to have a lot more than two figures (tax 
revenue and operation costs) to make a decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo isn't the only South County city looking for help from the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest officials say their library is undersized, and expansion may 
become an issue in the future. Laguna Hills is the only city in the county 
without a library, and city staff are preparing a report on the issue that will 
go before the City Council in March. 
</P>
<P>
 A Mission Viejo library report shows that eight of 14 South County libraries 
will be undersized by county standards as the fast-growing communities continue 
to expand over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The future of their libraries may rest on what happens in Mission Viejo, city 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten the information we need," Mayor Susan Withrow said. "Now it's up 
to the county as to whether they're going to cooperate with us. It's a matter 
of fair play now."

HURTT PROPOSES LOWER WAGES IN QUAKE RECOVERY; PUBLIC WORKS: THE GARDEN GROVE 
STATE SENATOR RENEWS ATTACK ON STATE'S PREVAILING-WAGE RATE. UNIONS AND 
DEMOCRATS GIVE HIS LEGISLATION LITTLE CHANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Sen. Rob Hurtt of Orange County sees opportunity amid the rubble of last 
month's powerful Northridge earthquake to save taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
 With the temblor causing nearly $3.5 billion in damage to the region's 
freeways and other public property, Hurtt (R-Garden Grove) has introduced 
legislation he says would slice wages for repair work by 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt's attack on the so-called "prevailing wage rate" paid to workers on 
public projects isn't anything new in Sacramento. Republican lawmakers have 
been trying for years to get the wage rate cut, but have consistently been 
thwarted by Democratic lawmakers sympathetic to organized labor. Hurtt himself 
introduced such a bill that was defeated in committee just last month. 
</P>
<P>
 But the earthquake -- and the huge tab for repairs to shattered freeway 
bridges -- has offered Hurtt a chance to raise the issue anew, arguing that 
cutting the wage rate could save taxpayers more than $450 million on "inflated 
and exorbitant" rebuilding costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The gist of the legislation is to revamp the state's complicated wage formula 
to bring it in line with the method used by the federal government, a change 
Hurtt and other Republicans say would dramatically cut costs for public 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is utterly unconscionable to me that we would continue to waste taxpayer 
dollars in a time of crisis," Hurtt said. "Currently, a flag man on a road job 
makes nearly $30 an hour, and nearly $50 an hour for overtime. It's a slap in 
the face to taxpayers and the victims of this earthquake who will have to foot 
the public-works repair bill." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But even with the Legislature eager to offer whatever help possible to 
earthquake victims, Democratic lawmakers say they expect Hurtt's new bill will 
die like all the others. Labor leaders also remain confident that they can, as 
they have many times in the past, defeat the measure in committee. They also 
suggest that Hurtt and others are using the earthquake simply to push their 
conservative agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're aggressively opposed," said John F. Henning, executive secretary of the 
California Labor Federation, AFL-CIO. "It's fair to conclude that these bills 
represent sternly conservative thought. They are using the earthquake for their 
own philosophical purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 Henning said it would be unfair to reduce wages paid to workers doing 
earthquake repairs because owners of contracting firms aren't being called on 
to make a similar sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should workers be penalized? The contractors won't be, the firms that 
supply materials won't be," Henning said. "Everyone else will get their fair 
share, what they feel is their due. It's a one-sided approach." 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic lawmakers also are drawing their sabers in the fight against 
Hurtt's bill. Sen. Patrick Johnston (D-Stockton) sent a memo to members of the 
Legislature last week, suggesting that Hurtt was using "highly misleading 
information" to push his stand on the wage issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston argued that it was pointless to talk about reducing the state's 
prevailing wage rate because most of the earthquake restoration work is 
federally financed and will fall under federal wages that, in California, are 
nearly equal to salaries established by the state formula. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that Hurtt's estimate of a 20% savings comes from a "highly 
flawed" study by the legislative analyst in 1990 that measured the differences 
in rates in three rural counties that are not indicative of the state as a 
whole. A study conducted in 1992 showed that wage changes wouldn't yield a 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston also said that Hurtt had ignored "the basic purpose" of the wage law 
-- to prevent out-of-state contractors and workers from unfairly underbidding 
their California counterparts. He suggested the law was helping stem an erosion 
of jobs in the construction trades, where one in five workers is unemployed. 
Moreover, he said, slashing the wage rate would undermine "the quality of 
craftsmanship" on the earthquake work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do we really want to trust the restoration of our public highways and 
buildings . . . to low-paid workers with questionable skills?" Johnston asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Such arguments don't sit well with Hurtt and others eager to reform the wage 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Yocca, Hurtt's top Sacramento aide, said the federal standard for 
California is "inflated" because it is based largely on the high salaries paid 
under state prevailing-wage rules. He also argued that craftsmanship would not 
suffer, because the same construction workers would be doing most of the jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Yocca disagreed with Johnston's justification that the wage laws are needed to 
stem out-of-state competition. He said the system is based on the federal 
Davis-Bacon Act of 1931, which was originally intended to let labor unions 
dominated by whites avoid competing for scarce jobs with migrant black workers 
willing to take lower wages. "It was originally intended as a racist law," 
Yocca said, adding that the wage regulations continue to hinder minority-owned 
firms to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pat Johnston isn't fooling anyone," Yocca concluded. "That letter is simply 
playing apologist for the labor unions. It's very simple to see through." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such fighting words, Yocca and others concede that they face an uphill 
fight in the Legislature. Even so, they hope that debate on the measure -- and 
a dose of public pressure -- could push Gov. Pete Wilson to take executive 
action to suspend the prevailing-wage law. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although such an action would enrage organized labor, there is precedence for 
such a move. After hurricanes struck Florida and Hawaii, then-President George 
Bush ordered the relaxation of wage standards in those states to ease repair 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Few in California expected President Clinton to do the same after the 
earthquake. Support from organized labor helped get him elected, and the 
President undid his predecessor's wage changes shortly after taking office. But 
many Republicans say Pete Wilson could help post-earthquake repairs by cutting 
the state rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson Administration officials said they are looking at that possibility, but 
no decisions have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 John Duncan, spokesman for the state Department of Industrial Relations, said 
the administration might attempt to ask for changes during upcoming budget 
negotiations

 David Wilk loves hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 He started playing when he was 12. Led his graduate school team in scoring two 
years in a row. Ask him his height and he'll say "5-9, on skates." His favorite 
players? Well, there's Wayne Gretzky, Tony Granato and Gilbert DeJesus. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert DeJesus? 
</P>
<P>
 That's right. DeJesus was an 18-year-old from Harlem, one of hundreds of 
youngsters whom Wilk has taken from the streets of New York at an early age and 
exposed to the joys of his favorite sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "He couldn't skate too well, but he could sure handle the stick," recalled 
Wilk, 38, who seven years ago founded Ice Hockey in Harlem, a nonprofit 
organization aimed at helping underprivileged youths like Gilbert. "He had a 
lot of heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Wilk's program grew in size and reputation. Kids whose closest 
contact with ice had been a glass of soda started body-checking and 
slap-shooting their way to prep school scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Disney Co. officials were so impressed with Wilk's program that they 
hired him last week to head a similar youth hockey program in the poorest 
Latino neighborhoods in Anaheim. With typical Disney fanfare, the program was 
renamed, linked to the Mighty Ducks franchise and hailed as the National Hockey 
League's first such youth hockey program. 
</P>
<P>
 For Wilk, it's a chance to make a career out of what previously had been only 
a labor of love. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never got paid for this before," Wilk said at a recent interview from a 
Mighty Ducks office in Anaheim Arena. "I had wanted to be an example. I wanted 
to show that if I could volunteer my time, then so could other people." 
</P>
<P>
 That type of idealism, however, changes slightly when you have to uproot your 
wife and three children from Teaneck, N.J., move to Orange County and still pay 
the bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Living here, he said, is a necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't really start a grass-roots organization without hanging out in the 
grass," said Wilk, who was born and raised in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of his life, Wilk has had two obsessions: hockey and helping those 
less fortunate than he. After graduating from Rutgers University in 1977, where 
he "majored in hockey and economics," he went to work for a community 
development agency helping the elderly in a run-down section of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, he went back to school, this time at the University of 
Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, where he continued to play hockey 
and studied to become "a good government type." Upon graduating, he went to 
work for the city of New York in its real estate and finance department but 
"quickly discovered government was no fun." 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Wilk joined Joseph E. Seagram & Sons Inc. as a budget manager. But 
he grew restless working at the alcohol distilling giant and started to develop 
the idea of starting a hockey program. After two years, he left the company and 
began consulting work so he could devote more time to his youth hockey program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was something I felt was worth pursuing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its inception in 1987, Ice Hockey in Harlem has been widely praised for 
its work and has been visited by scores of NHL stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilk had recently started passing responsibility for the program to others, to 
give himself more time with his family, when Disney approached him last August 
with the idea of starting the program in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was exciting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Wilk was leery of Disney's intentions.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was concerned," he said. "I didn't want it to be just a surface program. I 
wanted to know how they would go. I didn't want it to be a schlocky PR deal." 
But after months of discussions, Wilk was convinced that Disney's interest was 
genuine. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I didn't feel that they were committed, I wouldn't be here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney had its own demands. Wilk would have to forsake his allegiance to his 
beloved New York Rangers and become a Mighty Ducks fan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the Ducks," he said. "They're scrappy . . . but I can still root for 
the Rangers." 
</P>
<P>
 As announced, the Disney program, dubbed GOALS -- Growth Opportunities Through 
Athletics, Learning and Service -- will target underprivileged youths in two of 
Anaheim's most crime-plagued neighborhoods: Jeffrey-Lynne, which is less than a 
mile from Disneyland, and Ponderosa Park. 
</P>
<P>
 As he did in New York, Wilk intends to teach a group of youngsters the skills 
of hockey. Along the way, he hopes to steer them away from the drugs and gangs 
that are so prevalent in their young lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you give kids alternatives that are fun, they are going to be drawn to 
them," he said. "We want to teach them how to be good hockey players, but we 
need to teach them to be good people and responsible people. And the only way 
to do that is to treat them as your own kid." 
</P>
<P>
 The program will go beyond athletics to include after-school classes and 
participation in community service events. All the equipment and ice time will 
be supplied to youths free of charge as long as they participate. More advanced 
skaters will be encouraged to become "mentors" to less-experienced ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifics on the number of youngsters, volunteers and staff involved in the 
program have not yet been determined, Wilk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim will present Wilk with a different set of challenges than New York. 
For one thing, there will be a language barrier between Wilk and his 
predominantly Latino pupils. Also, he said, many of the residents in the two 
neighborhoods tend to be very transient. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are things we're going have to deal with," he said. "On the plus side, 
there is a business community, civic community and political community that are 
wildly enthusiastic about the program. The folks in Anaheim have been very 
impressive." 
</P>
<P>

DANA PARSONS: LISTENING RELIGIOUSLY IN HOPE OF HEARING THE RIGHT WORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She's reclining in a soft lobby chair in the Anaheim Marriott, a middle-aged 
woman wearing a cross around her neck, at once awash in the spirit of the lamb 
but wary of the wolf. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Daleo Topdjian is but one in the throng of Catholics at this weekend's 
Religious Education Congress in Anaheim, which brings teachers and clergy 
together for refresher seminars and increased understanding both of their 
religious work and contemporary issues. She teaches Catholic catechism to 
fourth- and fifth-graders in Sun Valley and comes to these conferences to stay 
certified. It is a conference she takes very seriously. She says you need to 
get re-certified every three to five years; this is her 10th consecutive 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I come every year, because I want to," she says. "It teaches you new things." 
She says the conference adds "a couple more dots" to her life and that "it's 
like going to college for three days." 
</P>
<P>
 So, yes, she is just where she wants to be. And yet, she is edgy, because it's 
about 45 minutes before the start of her next scheduled seminar. It's a seminar 
the computer kicked out for her -- the only one she has a ticket for -- because 
the one she wanted to attend was full. 
</P>
<P>
 What's upsetting her is that the listed speaker, identified as an "ex-priest 
and catechetical author," was among those vilified in a flyer distributed by a 
group of conservative Catholics. The flyer is headlined "WARNING" and 
identifies various speakers as "dissenters in sheep's clothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Topdjian is taking the warning seriously. "People wouldn't be picketing if it 
was not real," she says. "Nuns were passing out the flyers, so you know they're 
not fake. It (the flyer) is saying you don't want to be confused, and I don't. 
I don't want to hear a man lie." 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-four years old and the mother of an 11-year-old daughter, Topdjian is a 
school cafeteria worker in addition to her weekend catechism teaching. She is 
recently divorced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want him to confuse my thinking," she says of the speaker. "He's an 
ex-priest. I don't like the sound of that. What's an ex-priest doing here? Why 
should he get a pedestal? Why not get his own convention?" 
</P>
<P>
 Characterized by changelessness over the centuries, the Catholic Church has 
gone through some upheavals in the last generation. Vatican Council II in the 
early 1960s left many conservative Catholics thinking the Church had gone too 
far. More liberal members today think the Church isn't changing quickly enough 
to maintain its credibility with its parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
 Topdjian doesn't consider herself rigidly doctrinaire. She says the Church 
needed to revise some of its age-old practices and teachings and that there 
were reasons for the historic changes that came from Vatican II. 
</P>
<P>
 But she still supports the papal ban on birth control and adheres largely to 
the catechism of her youth, which established certain truths and taught that 
the Pope and the Bible are the sources of knowledge, not conference speakers of 
uncertain conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired of priests who are fly-by-night," she says. "I can't believe how 
many hypocrites there are today. This (conference) is supposed to be the real 
McCoy." 
</P>
<P>
 What is the danger in anything he might say? I ask her. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would be misleading people, who could in turn mislead the children," she 
says. "It all starts at the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 The flyer says her upcoming speaker's works have "been designed not to teach 
doctrine but to stimulate zeal for his version of Utopia." 
</P>
<P>
 She doesn't like the sound of "his version of Utopia," she says. To her, it's 
a signal that he's applying his own interpretation of heaven and "that he's not 
teaching doctrine -- what the Bible and the Pope have to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Topdjian thinks she can exchange her ticket for another workshop if she 
doesn't like what she hears. "If he's going to be controversial, a lot of 
people are going to walk out," she predicts. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole thing actually sort of mystifies her. How, she asks, does an 
ex-priest get clearance to give a seminar? "It sounds like the cable channel," 
she says. "Anybody who's got money can get on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Enjoy the weekend, I say as we part company. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always do," she replies. "I just hope he's not too upsetting. I won't stay 
if he says bad things."

GROUP FORMED IN VENTURA COUNTY TO WOO VALLEY FIRMS; ECONOMY: COALITION WILL 
PROVIDE RELOCATION ASSISTANCE TO BUSINESSES CONSIDERING A MOVE IN THE AFTERMATH 
OF THE EARTHQUAKE. BUT SOME IN LOS ANGELES CRITICIZE THE OFFER. 
</P>

<P>
 Insisting that they only want to be good neighbors, Ventura County business 
and government leaders have set up a coalition to attract quake-ravaged San 
Fernando Valley businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Wednesday, the newly formed Partners in Action coalition will offer a 
toll-free telephone line, a fast-track permit process and other relocation 
assistance to Los Angeles County businesses considering a temporary or 
permanent move to Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to send the message that we want to keep you in Southern California 
and we want to be good neighbors," coalition spokeswoman Dana Weber Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley business boosters, however, did not take the offer so genially. 
</P>
<P>
 "If these are my neighbors, God forbid what my enemies might do," said Ben 
Reznik, chairman of the Earthquake Recovery Task Force for the Valley Industry 
and Commerce Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're thinking very selfishly," said Reznik, a Sherman Oaks lawyer. "If 
they were thinking about the region, they wouldn't be doing this."  
</P>
<P>
 Some Valley business owners said by attempting to attract businesses -- even 
temporarily -- to Ventura County, the coalition puts the entire Valley economy 
at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "When businesses move out, it also affects the restaurants employees eat in 
and the stores they shop in," said Joe Kletzel, president of Chatsworth-based 
Devon Industries and a member of VICA. "It will destroy the economic base of 
the Valley."  
</P>
<P>
 Young disputed such talk, saying she doubts desirable commercial rental space 
can be found in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not aimed at stealing businesses," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition plans to spend about $30,000 on promotion and assistance, 
running ads in San Fernando Valley newspapers and on Valley radio stations and 
staffing the toll-free telephone line. 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition members promise that one phone call will be all a business needs to 
get industrial, commercial and residential rental information as well as advice 
on what local city best fits the company's needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition includes local chambers of commerce, county government, real 
estate firms, and individual businessmen and businesswomen. Young said although 
only a few cities have so far agreed to join the coalition and donate money 
toward its marketing effort, many others have expressed interest in 
participating. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities of Ventura and Oxnard have each donated $2,500. The Thousand Oaks 
City Council will discuss donating $2,500 to the effort at its council meeting 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Hayes, economic redevelopment manager for the city of Moorpark, said 
Moorpark is ready to help ease a company's relocation from the Valley. The 
Moorpark City Council has not yet discussed participating in the coalition, he 
said 
</P>
<P>
 "Any Valley business that comes through will receive immediate, special 
attention," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition's telephone number, which will be in effect Wednesday and 
operating out of the Ventura County Economic Development Assn.'s office in 
Oxnard, is 1-800-880-3700 or 805-988-1106.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; UNBROKEN SPIRITS; RELIGION: DESPITE DAMAGE TO 
THEIR CHURCH, MARY IMMACULATE CATHOLIC CHURCH PARISHIONERS STILL WORSHIP -- IN 
THE PARKING LOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Nothing can keep Angie Alvarado away from Mass at Mary Immaculate Catholic 
Church in Pacoima -- not even the magnitude 6.8 earthquake that devastated the 
church, forcing parishioners to worship in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been in the Valley for 43 years and this has been my parish all our 
lives," said Alvarado, 64, who recently celebrated her 40th wedding anniversary 
with husband Manuel at the church. "We have good memories here. And we 
hopefully will have more." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 temblor, parishioners have come by the hundreds to worship 
at the church on Sundays. First, they met on the field at the adjoining church 
school, also heavily damaged in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 When it rained, they congregated in a tent. Now they are meeting in a metal 
structure erected in the parking lot that will house the congregation for the 
next year while the church and school are being rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 The women still wear their high-heeled shoes and the men wear ties. Some 
parishioners bring their own chairs; others stand for the hourlong service. 
Most don't think twice about kneeling on the asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarado said no natural disaster could break the spirit of the loyal parish. 
She has seen her two children marry at the church and has three grandchildren 
enrolled at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "And besides, when you are here, you are here for God," Alvarado said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a sense of belonging here and they want to keep that," said Father 
Tom Rush, pastor of the large Latino and mostly low- income congregation. "We 
didn't chose for it to be this way, but God has given it to us and we will go 
forward." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The parish will apply for Federal Emergency Management Agency aid through the 
Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese and hopes to raise the rest of the money it 
will take to rebuild, Rush said.  
</P>
<P>
 It will take about $2 million to rebuild the school and much more money for a 
new church, officials said. Parish leaders hope the church building can be 
repaired, Rush said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the destruction, the church is still providing funeral, wedding and 
quincenera services for its more than 10,000 parishioners, Rush said. These 
services are being held in the parish hall, a small building that withstood the 
earthquake but can hold only about 300 people -- insufficient for the some 
1,500 worshipers who attend each of the nine masses held on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never did think that this would happen," said Anita M. Ramirez, 76, of 
Pacoima, who has been a parish member since the church was organized in 1951. 
"It is very painful because when you love your church and you have everything 
you need there, it is kind of hard." 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of the church's Guadalupanos, she helps organize fund-raisers for 
the parish, including a monthly menudo brunch. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the earthquake, selling menudo and all other fund-raising activities 
have been halted and the 45-member group is concentrating on raising money to 
rebuild the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right away people give donations, even if they are poor," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The elementary school attached to the church and built by parishioners in the 
1950s suffered severe quake damage and will be demolished this week, Rush said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 For the next few months, students are sharing classrooms with students at St. 
Ferdinand's Catholic School in San Fernando. They will return to Mary 
Immaculate when 10 portable classrooms are set up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We miss the school a lot," said Ricky Hernandez, 11, a sixth-grader and 
parish altar boy. "It is pretty sad for me because I have been here since the 
first grade." 
</P>
<P>
 "The children keep asking when they are going to come back," said Sister 
Virginia San Roman, the school's principal. "They want to come back here 
because this is their home." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, about 100 past and present parishioners reunited in the parish hall 
to remember the school before it is demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 Becky Aguilar, 34, of Sylmar, came with her two children -- partly to give 
them a chance to say goodby to their school -- but also for herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here in 1965 for first grade," she said to those assembled. "It was 
kind of weird once you graduate because you think you will never come back. But 
I am a traditionalist -- I have my two kids here now. It is sad they are going 
to tear the school down because I have a lot of fond memories here."  
</P>
<P>
 As parishioners applauded Aguilar's comments, Cindy Padilla, 31, of Arleta, 
raised her hand to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandmother and grandfather helped build this school," she said. "My 
children come to this school and I think as long as our kids are here and they 
are OK, there is still a school." 
</P>
<P>
 "The building was only a symbol of something; what is most important are the 
people," Rush told parishioners, as they quietly nodded in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Later, over cookies and punch, Priscilla Hernandez, 45, reminisced about the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was here the first day the school opened," she said. "My father helped 
build the church; I was married here, and my two children were baptized here." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she is no longer a parish member, she said she had to see the school 
one last time. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get the chills when you see the church and you want to cry," said 
Hernandez's mother, Angelina Marez, 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez and Marez took pictures of the school to send to family members in 
San Jose who once attended the church and who were devastated when they heard 
of its fate.

SCOTT HARRIS: A STORY TOO HOT FOR MAINSTREAM MEDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes it's embarrassing to work for the Establishment media. When you get 
scooped on a big story, your editors are often just too stuffy or stubborn to 
follow it.  
</P>
<P>
 Consider the reaction to the most shocking news report to emerge from the 
Northridge earthquake: "L.A. QUAKE OPENS GATES OF HELL!" If you saw the 
headline in the Weekly World News, you must have seen its stunning "exclusive 
photo" of a monstrous creature emerging from the fissure in the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Mann's "special report" is loaded with info you'll see nowhere else: 
President Clinton, no less, has persuaded Gov. Pete Wilson to order the 
National Guard to "find and neutralize" the "17 and possibly 18 demons" that 
emerged from "the crack in the Golden State Freeway one by one, around 7:30 
a.m. on Jan. 17." Not only that, but National Guardsmen fired 200 rounds into 
one demon without inflicting so much as a scratch! And the real magnitude 
wasn't 6.6 or 6.7 or 6.8 . . . but really 6.66! That's right: Take out the 
decimal and you've got the sign of the Devil! 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the news snobs, obsessing over the likes of Tonya Harding, Michael 
Jackson and the Bobbitts, act like this is some big joke. An item for Only in 
L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates of Hell. Demons. 6.66. 
</P>
<P>
 Ha ha ha. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How soon they forget that it was Weekly World News' sister publication, the 
National Enquirer, that first published photos of presidential candidate Gary 
Hart frolicking on the Monkey Business with old what's-her-name. Donna 
Something. 
</P>
<P>
 True, the Enquirer paid one of Ms. Something's pals for the info and those 
photos. Heck, if those Arkansas state troopers kept an Instamatic handy, they 
might be rich now. Just because the tabloids practice checkbook journalism 
doesn't mean they don't come up with the goods sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hmmm. Could it be that the Weekly World News made a deal with . . . SATAN! 
</P>
<P>
 Since no one else seems to have the guts to pursue this story, I took it upon 
myself to call Lantana, Fla., home of both the Enquirer and the Weekly World 
News. (That's another thing that bugs me: How could a Florida-based weekly have 
whupped our fannies in our own back yard?) 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it's understood that reporters can be a sneaky bunch. When I reached the 
offices of the Weekly World News, I never misrepresented myself -- that would 
be unethical. But I didn't just come right out and ask them if they were in bed 
with Satan, either. Instead, I asked to speak to someone about their T-shirt 
offer, which was true as far as it goes. 
</P>
<P>
 The operator put me through to Irene Crossman. 
</P>
<P>
 She's the office manager and the T-shirt maven. You see, the Weekly World News 
sells T-shirts silk-screened with some of their more memorable covers. 
</P>
<P>
 Irene says it started with employees making shirts for themselves. Then 
somebody had the bright idea of offering them to the public. Readers can send 
in for, say, the cover depicting President Clinton's secret encounter with a 
space alien. Or the farmer who bagged a 23-pound grasshopper. Or the boy with 
the eight-inch tongue ("and it's still growing!"). 
</P>
<P>
 I asked whether the Weekly World News would be marketing a "Gates of Hell" 
T-shirt in the near future. I suggested that, with all the "I Survived the 
Great L.A. Earthquake" shirts being sold around town, they are missing a great 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," Irene Crossman said, "we hadn't planned it. But it's not a big deal to 
do it. I do want to make another -- the 'Famed Psychic's Head Explodes.' " That 
edition, from the early '80s, "was very popular," Irene added. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingerly, I worked toward the key questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see you reported that the true magnitude was 6.66," I ventured. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," Irene said with a knowing laugh, "we couldn't help ourselves with that 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 Her giggle could only be described as devilish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, Irene Crossman was on to me. She could sense that this wasn't 
just a reader asking about T-shirts but a reporter pursuing the story of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you going to write a story?" she said. "I better have you talk with 
Eddie." 
</P>
<P>
 This would be Eddie Clontz, the editor of Weekly World News. Irene, nothing if 
not polite, promised that she would relay my message to Clontz. She promised to 
send me some T-shirts, gratis. Of course I insisted on paying full price. This 
reporter can't be bought. 
</P>
<P>
 Irene assured me that Eddie Clontz would call me back. So far, he hasn't. Not 
that I blame him. It's not his job to help the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it makes you wonder. If the Weekly World News wasn't in cahoots with 
Hades, well, they might at least appreciate the fact that I awakened them to a 
fertile market. In the weeks ahead, if you see people running around Los 
Angeles in "Gates of Hell" T-shirts, you'll know they took my advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it seems obvious that a decent organization, one with nothing to hide, 
would send a royalty check. 
</P>
<P>
 The money, I assure you, would be given to a worthy cause.

SCHOOLS TRY NEW WAYS TO STOP VIOLENCE; EDUCATION: RATHER THAN CRACK DOWN ON 
STUDENTS WHO FIGHT, ADMINISTRATORS SAY CHILDREN MUST LEARN TO MEDIATE 
CONFLICTS.

 After recent violence at schools from Simi Valley to Ventura, worried parents 
have demanded stiffer campus security, stricter student discipline and other 
traditional tactics for dealing with unruly students. 
</P>
<P>
 And school officials are heeding those demands. In Thousand Oaks and Simi 
Valley, for example, committees are examining proposals for tougher dress codes 
to discourage gangs, additional electronic equipment for security guards, and 
closer links between school officials and police. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials in several school districts are trying alternative approaches to 
combatting school violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of simply cracking down on students prone to fighting, some educators 
say, schools must teach children how to settle conflicts before they turn 
physical. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to teach kids how to resolve their differences other than by 
violence," said Jerry Gross, superintendent of the Conejo Valley Unified School 
District in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 An after-school shooting in Thousand Oaks that left three students wounded has 
prompted the Conejo Valley district to consider training high school students 
to mediate between hostile classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the fatal stabbing of a Simi Valley junior high school student by a 
classmate has led school officials there to consider training all of the 
district's teachers in how to help children resolve conflicts peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard elementary school officials plan to begin teaching conflict resolution 
to students in kindergarten through sixth grade. Called "Working Toward Peace," 
the new curriculum aims to help children manage anger and end disputes 
peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
 Teaching conflict-resolution skills at school has become more urgent, 
educators say, as fights among children turn lethal. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have always been fights at schools," said Ileene Gershon, an assistant 
principal at Haydock Intermediate School in Oxnard. "In an earlier time, when 
kids had confrontations with each other and couldn't resolve their conflicts, 
they would use their fists, they would push, they would swear." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Gershon said: "The violence has escalated because there's weapons 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Ventura County school districts, Ventura Unified so far has the most 
extensive conflict-resolution program. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, a handful of Ventura middle schools and elementary schools began to 
train some students to act as mediators with their classmates. Recent 
race-related fights among Ventura High School students prompted the district to 
extend the program to the high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional method of suspending students who are fighting usually fails 
to end the dispute, Ventura Supt. Joseph Spirito said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they come back two days or three days later, they're still angry," he 
said. "It's not resolved. As a matter of fact, they're probably angrier." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, using student mediators to resolve conflicts defuses the 
underlying tensions, Spirito said. "It works. It's unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 At Anacapa Middle School in Ventura, officials credit their 33 student 
mediators with helping to reduce suspensions by 80% since the program was 
established in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We told students, 'We can help you solve little problems before they become 
big problems,' " Anacapa counselor Roanna Bostwick said. "And they are flocking 
in here." 
</P>
<P>
 One recent morning, 14-year-old Karla Hernandez came to Bostwick to complain 
about a boy who would not stop calling her names. When Bostwick suggested 
calling in student mediators, Karla agreed. "They understand better than 
principals," she said later. 
</P>
<P>
 Bostwick assigned two peer helpers to help resolve this dispute. About noon, 
in a meeting room near the school office, mediators Olympia McCurtis and 
Vincent Badilla took their places around a table with Karla and the boy she had 
complained about, seventh-grader Andy Ayala. No school officials were present. 
</P>
<P>
 After kicking off the session with introductions and handshakes around the 
table, Olympia and Vincent -- both eighth-graders -- ran through a printed list 
of questions aimed at helping Karla and Andy come to an understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 The mediators eventually learned that Andy had begun calling Karla names after 
her older brother started calling him names. Karla had responded to Andy's 
torments by hurling epithets of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 "You didn't like it when she called you names," Vincent said to Andy. "So do 
you think she liked it when you called her names?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Andy and Karla both signed a sheet of paper agreeing to solve 
their conflict by staying away from each other. 
</P>
<P>
 And to make sure they abided by their pledge, Olympia reminded the two 
students that pupils who fail to solve their conflicts through mediation face 
possible discipline from Anacapa Principal Charlotte McElroy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to end up with Miss McElroy," Olympia warned. "She won't be 
nice." 
</P>
<P>
 The entire mediation session lasted half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Mediation works, said conflict-resolution specialist Judith Rubenstein, 
because "it sets a mutual safe place where people can start to talk to each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 The two people having the dispute gradually see that they share the same 
feelings of anger, fear and distrust, said Rubenstein, who has contracted with 
the Ventura school district to launch a student mediation program at the high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "By sitting across the table and hearing someone else, you see their basic 
humanity and who they are," Rubenstein said. "They're no longer the enemy." 
</P>
<P>
 In some districts, teachers or administrators may also act as mediators 
between students. But student mediation programs have the advantage of allowing 
children who are embroiled in conflict to seek help from their peers instead of 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Children feel less ashamed about turning to classmates for help than to 
authority figures, educators say. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can make it socially acceptable to solve problems in a nonviolent 
manner, that's what everybody wants," said Susan Parks, assistant 
superintendent of the Simi Valley Unified School District. "That's what a 
schoolwide program does. Then kids don't have to be bold and not back down." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although some Simi Valley elementary schools use student mediators to help 
children resolve disputes on the playground, none of the district's schools 
have formal, schoolwide programs aimed at teaching conflict resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley officials had scheduled a training session on conflict resolution 
for a group of elementary school teachers, but it was postponed after the Jan. 
17 earthquake damaged several schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, 14-year-old Chad Hubbard was stabbed to death at Valley View 
Junior High following a long-running dispute with a classmate that began, some 
students said, when the two boys gave each other funny looks in a school 
hallway. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident has led Simi Valley school officials to consider training all of 
the district's teachers, not just those in elementary schools, to help students 
learn to avoid violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need some sort of systematic training," Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, high school students who volunteer as peer counselors are 
sometimes called to school offices to talk to classmates involved in a dispute. 
But the peer counselors have no formal training in mediation and rarely meet 
with both sides in a dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent shooting of three Westlake High School students has led district 
officials to consider expanding the high school peer counseling programs to 
include mediation. 
</P>
<P>
 The melee occurred after school and was sparked by racial animosity, according 
to attorneys involved in the case. A junior football player, who is white, and 
a sophomore Asian American were supposed to have a fistfight. But the sophomore 
was accompanied by five carloads of associates who attacked the football player 
and some of his friends with baseball bats, sticks -- and bullets, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three students were wounded. Four 16-year-old Asian American boys have been 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake High officials had tried traditional means to avert the confrontation 
between the junior and sophomore, who had a history of animosity. In addition 
to suspending the boys last year for fighting, officials had warned them this 
year that they would be punished again if they came to blows. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The students simply moved the fight to a park off campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley Supt. Gross said he believes that using student mediators on the 
high school campuses may help defuse racial conflicts as well as other types of 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of using mediators, some districts are taking the Oxnard Elementary 
district's approach, using prepackaged curricula aimed at teaching students to 
settle conflicts without violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Such course work on conflict resolution techniques is useful, experts say. But 
teachers need to ensure that students put the skills into practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more curriculum the better in conflict resolution," Rubenstein said. 
"Every kid should be exposed to these ideas: When is it appropriate to avoid 
(conflict)? When is it appropriate to try to talk about it and do something 
about it? And how do you talk about it?" 
</P>
<P>
 But, she said, "conflict resolution is about how we talk to each other, the 
way we talk. The only way to learn that is by practicing it."

2 GANGS CELEBRATE TRUCE ON THE FIELD; FOOTBALL: PACOIMA PROJECT BOYS AND SUN 
VALLEY VINELANDS PLAY A GAME. ORGANIZERS ENCOURAGE MUTUAL RESPECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Long after the 300 or so rival gang members forget the score of Saturday's 
great football game, 19-year-old Victor Perez might remember how it felt on the 
sidelines, watching the action from his wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez was three weeks away from being protected by the now 110-day truce among 
San Fernando Valley gangs, celebrated by the game between the Pacoima Project 
Boys and the Sun Valley Vinelands. On Oct. 3, when he and two other Project 
Boys walked through a Panorama City parking lot, Perez was shot in the back by 
an unknown assailant.  
</P>
<P>
 As he watched his homeboys give up the second of two touchdowns for a 12-0 
loss to the Vinelands, Perez quietly said it is unlikely he will walk again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I get mad when I see everyone get along, because of what happened 
to me," Perez said, noting that before the truce, the attack on him would have 
met with swift reprisal. As it is, he said, his deadened legs have gone 
unavenged. 
</P>
<P>
 "But other times, I think it's better this way, because I don't want nobody to 
go through what I've gone through." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez -- and the football game he watched -- represent the triumph and the 
difficulty of getting thousands of Valley gang members to lay down their 
weapons. Although most of the vatos , or homeboys, have come to believe in the 
value of a truce, no one is saying it has been easy. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the rivals gathered at Pacoima Park well before the noon kickoff, 
checking out the competition as they gravitated to opposite sides of the 
playing field.  
</P>
<P>
 Some gang members had met their longtime enemies at weekly "commission" 
meetings, which since Oct. 31 of last year, have given representatives from 
Valley gangs a chance to get together and work out differences without 
confrontation. Others knew their rivals only from the street, from the days 
when the words "Vinelands" or "PBS" etched across a neck or arm were enough to 
provoke a shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The kickoff, which the coin toss-winning Project Boys choose to receive, was 
preceded by the removal of earrings, necklaces, bracelets and rings. Referees 
from the city's Department of Recreation and Parks, the Cities in Schools 
program and the YMCA explained that tackle football with "college rules" meant 
no chopping at the legs, no airborne tackles and no piling on. 
</P>
<P>
 The first quarter was an effort in feeling out the terrain. Hits were swift 
and fair, with tacklers often jumping up after a knock to prove their lack of 
offense; whistles were long and hard, an effort to keep tackles from erupting 
into brawls. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the second quarter, as the on-lookers howled, the Vinelands' Marcos 
Velasquez scored a touchdown on a pass from quarterback Raunel (Cyclone) 
Vargas, ending the first half at 6-0. The crowd cheered Velasquez using his 
street name, "Iceman." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those watching from the sidelines was William (Blinky) Rodriguez, a 
39-year-old Van Nuys businessman whose son was killed four years ago during a 
drive-by shooting. Rodriguez was an organizer of the gang truce. 
</P>
<P>
 Joined by Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon, who represents Pacoima, 
and officers from the LAPD's Foothill Division, Rodriguez made his way to both 
sides of the field, reminding players that they could cheer their own players 
and still show respect to their opponents, and could hit hard without hitting 
to hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Lopez, 17, watched the game from the Vinelands' side. Standing with 
three friends and their young children, Lopez ticked off the street names of 
friends killed by members of the gang who now stared at her from across a 
grassy field.  
</P>
<P>
 "There was Dealer and Cuzzy and Giant," Lopez said. "You can still be angry, 
but you have to change. Now, maybe we won't lose more of them."

BOY'S RETURN DOESN'T MEAN END OF ORDEAL

 Although 4-year-old Taj Yaser Jayyusi has been found and his suspected 
abductors put in jail, his foster mother's rejoicing was tempered Saturday by 
worries that he may not be coming home. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan White, a special eduction teacher, said she usually spends most 
Saturdays walking with Taj around the community lake, maybe stopping for 
doughnuts, and then taking him to the park to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But the boy, allegedly abducted by his biological parents, remained this 
Saturday in Orangewood Children's Home, the county's shelter for neglected and 
abused children.  
</P>
<P>
 White said that county social workers told her they must determine whether Taj 
will be secure in her home now that his parents know her address. "They said 
they want to consider a confidential placement" in another foster home, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would move if I had to if I could keep Taj," said White, who is 43 and 
single. She said she was told Orange County social services officials will meet 
Tuesday to determine if she can continue to be his foster mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Orangewood officials were unavailable Saturday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Howard, director of the county's children's services, also could not be 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
 White said she was taking a shower on the morning of Feb. 12 when Taj 
mysteriously disappeared from the play area in her garage. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy was missing for six days before he was found Friday night. Orange 
County sheriff's deputies said they found him in a car parked in Cerritos, 
where his father, Yaser Majed Jayyusi, 55, had gone to pick up his paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 The father and mother, Deborah Ann Jayyusi, 35, who was also found in the car, 
were taken to Orange County Jail, where they are being held on suspicion of 
child abduction. They were being held in lieu of $250,000 bail each. 
</P>
<P>
 White said she had been allowed only 15 minutes with Taj on Friday night at 
Orangewood after his parents were arrested. He was in pajamas and looking weary 
from his ordeal. She said he complained that she had not brought the family 
dogs along and asked if he could go home the next day.  
</P>
<P>
 "I said they have to check you out and make decisions," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 White said she went to Orangewood on Saturday morning, but was not allowed to 
see him.  
</P>
<P>
 Taj and his younger sister were removed from their parents two years ago and 
placed in protective custody. Jennifer Ghormley, a special advocate appointed 
by the court to watch over the children, said they were physically abused by 
their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 As as special education teacher, White said she has skills that help her with 
Taj, who she said is hyperactive and has been rejected by other foster homes 
because of his behavior. "We're tight. As he says, 'We are a team,' " she said 
of their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 White said she is trying to adopt Taj. 
</P>
<P>
 Ghormley praised the influence that White has had on the boy, who she said has 
gained considerable self-esteem in the teacher's care. "She loves him dearly," 
Ghormley said. "There is no better match they could come up with." 
</P>
<P>
 White said it was sad for her not be be able to comfort Taj. "It is so 
maddening," she said. "You know he needs a good bath and a story read to him. 
The sooner he gets into a routine, the sooner he will heal from this horrendous 
week. . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 White said she is very grateful to the Sheriff's Department for finding Taj 
and to her neighbors, who have pitched in to help with housework and meals. 
"The outpouring of help has been phenomenal," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said residents in Rancho Santa Margarita, who had planned a candlelight 
vigil today for Taj, will instead hold a celebration that White said she will 
attend to thank everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel real good I know where he is and that he is safe," White said.

 Betty Limon, 16, wished she had the courage to speak up when her history books 
ignore Mexicans' contributions to the United States. She wants to learn from 
teachers who came here from Mexico, like she did. And most of all, she hopes 
she can be the first in her family to graduate from college. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim High School honors student was one of about 40 students who 
attended the Chicano Youth and Community Conference on Saturday at Cal State 
Fullerton to discuss how they, as Chicanos or Mexican Americans, fit in the 
education system. 
</P>
<P>
 Community activists and professors encouraged the students to fight for more 
Chicano history and more Latino teachers in the schools by staging 
demonstrations, such as last year's walkout and march at Fullerton College. On 
Sept. 16, Mexican Independence Day, about 300 high school and college students 
demonstrated near the college in favor of creating Chicano studies classes and 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers also gave students specifics on which high school classes they need 
to get into college, and told them how to apply for college financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like they say, if you don't know where you came from, how do you know where 
you're going?" Limon said. "It's so hard for Chicanos to succeed in college. 
There's a cultural barrier." 
</P>
<P>
 The conference was sponsored by the Solevar Community Development Corporation, 
which aims to increase solidarity among Chicanos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Liberation is our guiding principle," said panelist Seferino Garcia, a 
Solevar activist from Anaheim. "Liberation will crush the chains of 
intellectual oppression." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said he thinks violent teen-agers are the product of a school system 
that has ignored their background. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need our history taught now. It's been 500 years of oppression," he said. 
"If we do not bring in relevant Chicano education we will not be able to walk 
in the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia and the other speakers said they hope the students realize the 
importance of working together to fight racism in the schools and the important 
role that public protests should play in their struggle to make education 
relevant to their culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicano studies classes, they said, would help Chicano students academically, 
because a focus on their heritage will make them feel worthy of attention in a 
system that usually just highlights Europeans' contributions to history. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers criticized Orange County school districts for the lack of Latino 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to 1992 statistics, 90% of the county's teachers are white, while 
white students comprise 49% of Orange County's student population from 
kindergarten through 12th grade.  
</P>
<P>
 Panelist Francisco Palacios, a freshman at Cal State Fullerton and a member of 
the Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan, or MEChA, told the teens that 
even seemingly trivial college customs can confuse an unprepared Mexican 
American student. 
</P>
<P>
 "After several days of a class my first semester, I saw the other students 
handing in papers. I said, 'Why? The teacher didn't tell us homework was due,' 
" Palacios said. "That's how I learned what a syllabus was. The paper the 
teacher handed out turned out to be very important." 
</P>
<P>
 Palacios had even more practical advice for the audience: "We get too hung up 
on partying, drinking, puppy love. Don't let any guy or young lady tie you 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 MEChA chapters at the university and several Orange County high schools helped 
put on the conference, which members said they hope will become an annual 
event.

STEEPER RENTS MAY FORCE FIRE SURVIVORS OUT; RELOCATION: LAGUNA BEACH RENTERS, 
MOST OF THEM UNINSURED, FEAR HOUSING COSTS WILL PRICE THEM OUT OF THE MARKET AS 
LANDLORDS REBUILD. MANY ARTISTS LOST BOTH HOMES AND STUDIOS.

<P>
 Four months after the firestorm that swept through this city, some of the 
hardest hit victims appear to be renters, many of whom were uninsured and who 
face serious questions about being able to reclaim their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly hard hit were artists who lost both rented homes and studios in 
the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 "Undoubtedly, there has been a social (and) economic upheaval here, especially 
for renters," said Community Development Director Kyle Butterwick. "There's no 
doubt in my mind about that." 
</P>
<P>
 David Sabaroff, who heads the Canyon Acres Renters Assn., a support group 
formed after the fire, said about half the residents of that heavily burned 
community were renters. Only one of the 30 that Sabaroff has met with carried 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabaroff, an artist who lost his home and a studio, said it is that combined 
loss that has been hardest to accept. "It's so total you can't fathom it 
without going through the experience," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing renters find particularly worrisome is the possibility they may 
never be able to move back home. As landlords rebuild, renters predict that 
some landowners will have new, higher mortgages that will prompt steeper rents. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we've seen is many longtime residents of Laguna who were renters are 
facing the distinct possibility of having to leave Laguna because there is no 
affordable housing to go to," said Anita Mangels, director of the Laguna Fire 
Relief Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Rick Jenkins, a member of the Laguna Board of Realtors, said he has 
received "quite a number of calls" from renters who moved out of the city to 
stay with friends or family after the fire and who now want to come back. 
</P>
<P>
 But renters say most of their former neighbors have, for the moment at least, 
managed to relocate somewhere within the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Durocher, 42, an artist who lost her Canyon Acres home and workshop, said 
she has moved to North Laguna with her boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the only way I could stay in town. I couldn't afford the rents they 
were asking," she said. "I would have done anything not to leave. . . . It's 
been my home for 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 While some federal rental assistance is available, fire survivors say 
accepting it increases the chances they will have to leave Laguna Beach because 
recipients must be willing to move to a comparably priced dwelling within 20 
miles of their job. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're uninsured, you're at the mercy of the government and the private 
organizations here in Laguna," said Polly Ferrell, who lost the Canyon Acres 
home where she had lived for 20 years. Ferrell said she has moved to a slightly 
larger home where she now pays twice the rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally have had a lot of help, a lot of help," Ferrell said, citing 
support from local churches and the Laguna Fire Relief Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the director of the coalition, a community-based group that 
renters hail as particularly supportive, has expressed concerns lately about 
its future financial welfare. Mangels said some money the coalition expected to 
receive is instead being diverted to Los Angeles area earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "With some of the larger institutional sources of funding, we have been told 
that the resources have been committed to the earthquake and there's really not 
much left," Mangels said. "We have not had to turn anybody away for lack of 
funds at this point, but looking to the future, we recognize that we will need 
to secure additional funding." 
</P>
<P>
 Janice Jensen, a college instructor who lost the Canyon Acres rental home 
where she had lived for 18 years, said the relief group has provided an ongoing 
sense of community for uprooted residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The impact of something like this doesn't come to you until after several 
months," Jensen said. "The coalition has been just great, because they seem to 
be there for the long haul and they have maintained their sympathetic posture." 
</P>
<P>
 While now may be a hard time for the city's renters, some say they have been 
buoyed by the help they have received since their former lives went up in 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nowhere else in the world would people get the support that we get," said 
Jeff DiPaolo. "I'd bet the farm that everybody is paying more rent and the 
lifestyles have changed dramatically. But that's what happens in a disaster."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; TELETHON FOR QUAKE VICTIMS PLANNED

<P>
 Spanish-language television station KSTV will hold a telethon today to benefit 
Ventura County earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, being run in conjunction with the American Red Cross, will be from 
1 to 6 p.m. at KSTV studios, 6020 Nicolle Ave., Ventura. It is the first 
telethon that the 3-year-old station has attempted, said Promotions Director 
Susan Robles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt there was a need for us to try to help our community," Robles said. 
She said the station -- which broadcasts in Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis 
Obispo counties -- has already received $5,000 in pledges. 
</P>
<P>
 The station is seeking volunteers, both English- and Spanish-speaking, to 
answer phones during the telethon. For information, call 650-8857. TRACY WILSON

INDUSTRIAL FIRE FORCES EVACUATION IN BURBANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fire at an industrial plating company Saturday night forced authorities to 
evacuate a three- to four-block area around Chestnut and Mariposa streets, 
where they feared toxic fumes from the blaze could endanger residents, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 75 firefighters and three hazardous materials teams fought the blaze 
at Alert Plating Co. that was first reported about 6:30 p.m. said Mike Hand of 
Verdugo fire communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Hand said trace amounts of cyanide gas -- about one part per million -- were 
detected in the air, but that such a level is not considered dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 A level of 10 parts per million or greater is believed to be unsafe, Hand 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 An unknown number of residents was evacuated to a center at Disney Elementary 
School, Hand said. 
</P>
<P>
 The evacuations were precautionary, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials are investigating the cause and origin of the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 No damage estimate was immediately available.

GIRL'S CONDITION STABLE AFTER BEING SHOT THROUGH STOMACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 13-year-old girl was in stable condition at Mission Hospital Regional 
Medical Center in Mission Viejo on Saturday following surgery required after 
her 14-year-old brother accidentally shot her through the stomach, authorities 
said. She is expected to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is a very lucky young lady," said Lt. William Francis of the Orange 
County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis said the girl was shot once in the stomach at close range in her 
Rancho Santa Margarita home after her brother pulled the trigger on a gun he 
thought was unloaded. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14-year-old boy had gone into an upstairs closet to get an unloaded 
.40-caliber Glock semiautomatic handgun that was owned by his mother's fiance, 
Francis said. Before the shooting, the boy had been seen outside the home in 
the 200 block of Via Serena, pointing the gun at passersby, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy came back inside the house, Francis said, and continued to play with 
the gun. The 14-year-old found a loaded clip and put it in the gun.  
</P>
<P>
 "One of his friends pulled the clip out and said 'It won't fire now,' " 
Francis said.  
</P>
<P>
 But a bullet was still lodged in a chamber, he said. When the boy's sister 
told him to put the gun away or their mother would be angry, Francis said, the 
boy reacted by pointing the gun at her and shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Francis said the boy was arrested for discharging a firearm in a grossly 
negligent manner that could result in injury or death. He was booked into 
Orange County Juvenile Hall.

LEAF IT TO THEM TO SHADE COSTA MESA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of residents who want to plant more than 4,000 trees in the city will 
meet Feb. 26 to plant pear trees on Baker Street. 
</P>
<P>
 ReLeaf Costa Mesa, as the group is known, has a $4,500 grant from the state 
but needs volunteers to dig holes and plant the trees, said organizer John 
DeWitt. 
</P>
<P>
 ReLeaf was founded in September, 1993, and has about 150 volunteers, DeWitt 
said. "It's new, but it really gained a lot of community support rather 
quickly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-five people met in October to plant trees along Adams Avenue. DeWitt 
said he thinks about 80 will show up to plant 74 trees along Baker Street 
between Fairview Road and Bear Street. Snacks and drinks will be free, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 DeWitt said the trees will be planted along the parkway between the curb and 
sidewalk. Those areas along the north side of Baker are separated from 
residents' homes by a wall. As a result, many residents leave the parkway 
untended, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, the group would like to plant trees on Placentia Avenue. DeWitt 
said they will need city help to break up some of the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 DeWitt said the city's Community Services Department has provided stakes and 
shovels. City workers also used a backhoe to prepare the holes and will fill 
them with dirt. "We'd almost need dynamite to get into that clay," DeWitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is rain, the group will plant the pear trees on March 5, DeWitt said. 
Volunteers will plant trees on Baker Street between Harbor Boulevard and 
Fairview Road on March 19.

A DECADE OF PAIN WIPES OUT ALL HOPE IN FAMILY OF MISSING CHILD; SAN FRANCISCO: 
KEVIN COLLINS WAS 10 WHEN HE VANISHED. KIN HELD MEMORIAL SERVICE TO LET HIM GO, 
BUT THEIR LIVES WILL NEVER BE THE SAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 He would be a man now. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the hardest thing to understand, looking into the eyes of the 
freckle-faced boy who stares from posters and flyers in the office of the 
foundation that bears his name. 
</P>
<P>
 Hair mussed, eyes big with an am-I-in-trouble look, 10-year-old Kevin Collins 
peers over his shoulder in the picture that has graced a hundred thousand 
flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to imagine him with three of his brothers stealing change for candy 
from the wishing pond at Golden Gate Park. It's easy to imagine him dirty from 
fighting schoolyard battles for his younger brothers at St. Agnes School. It's 
not easy to imagine him dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Only now, 10 years after he disappeared off a San Francisco street corner on 
his way home from basketball practice one winter night, has his family begun to 
be able to imagine him that way. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, the other eight Collins children, now 17 to 29, went to their 
mother Ann and said, "We need to let Kevin be at peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Then they approached their father, the director and "chief cook and bottle 
washer" of the Kevin Collins Foundation for Missing Children. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came to me eight months ago. They said they wanted a resolution," said 
54-year-old David Collins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will make it easier . . . ," said the thin man in a subdued gray 
sweater who has devoted his life to searching, first for his son, then for 
other missing children when hope for his son's return dimmed. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 10, the family gathered at Holy Cross Cemetery for a private memorial 
service. There, they dedicated a simple granite bench nestled between two 
trees. It bears Kevin's picture and the engraved words, "Forever in our 
hearts." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a special place in the new area for children. It's beautiful." said his 
mother, Ann Deasy Collins. She sits with hands clasped tightly together, 
looking younger than her 54 years in the foundation's San Francisco office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have all accepted that Kevin is dead. For a long time we hardly 
talked." 
</P>
<P>
 When they held a family meeting to discuss the memorial, it was the first time 
in years they'd all been in the same room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin has brought us together again." 
</P>
<P>
 She has come during her lunch hour from her job as secretary to a painting 
contractor. She looks too tiny to have borne seven children. 
</P>
<P>
 The years after Kevin's disappearance were hard on the family. Traumas like 
the one the Collinses endured don't heal easily, and the scars spawn their own 
troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the other children -- including a foster child and a cousin who grew up 
with the family -- were troubled. One day their brother was there, the next day 
he was gone. The kids had trouble sleeping. Their grades slipped. 
</P>
<P>
 The three youngest, who roamed as a fearless band together with Kevin, were 
afraid to leave the family apartment. Eventually the three oldest dropped out 
of school. Five years later David and Ann divorced. It was an amicable parting. 
Neither attributes it directly to Kevin's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes you down to basics -- really shows you who you are and what's 
important," David said. Maybe things would have worked out differently if they 
hadn't lost Kevin. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few of the children have spent time at the foundation. "They stay out 
of here," said their father, looking around the clearly nonprofit office that 
has become his second home. "I knew after he was gone that this was going to be 
my life's work." 
</P>
<P>
 For Ann, the focus was the children. "We were blessed because we had a large 
family, we had something to put our energy into." 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine what it would have been like if he'd been an only child. I 
wouldn't still be here. I couldn't have taken it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kevin isn't gone. Tellingly, when she goes down the list to get the ages 
of her children right, she still includes Kevin, right between Gary, 21, and 
Kenny, 18. 
</P>
<P>
 It has taken years for the family to come out of shock, she said. It was 
especially hard for the other children, always being the sibling of "that boy 
who disappeared." 
</P>
<P>
 But life has gone on. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny graduated from high school last year. Stephen, 24, got married in 
January. There are three grandchildren; 29-year-old Laura has a daughter and 
Michelle, 26, has a girl and a boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann said she thinks the memorial will let them put Kevin to rest. But she 
doesn't expect to get over it -- ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turns your life upside down. Sometimes it seems like there's only 
before-Kevin and after-Kevin." 
</P>
<P>
 Out of the whole family, David has been caught the most. He's channeled his 
grief into searching for missing children. Several state laws that help keep 
child murderers behind bars bear his mark. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've changed. I'm not the same person I was when Kevin disappeared. We 
wouldn't know him if he came back today. And maybe he wouldn't know us." 
</P>
<P>
 David Collins stopped. His long frame tensed a little and an expression of 
sadness washed over his face. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, he'd know me. I know he'd know me."

CHILDREN TRAPPED IN ELEVATOR FIGHT FEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE CROCKER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six-year-old Saphronia Sallard takes the stairs wherever she goes, and if her 
mother thinks there are too many stairs, she doesn't go at all. It has been 
more than a year since she visited a cousin who lives on the eighth floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Saphronia has refused to set foot in an elevator since the World Trade Center 
bombing trapped her in the smoky, coffin-like darkness of a stalled elevator 
for five hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "My stomach strangles" just talking about the field trip she and 16 other 
classmates took a year ago, Saphronia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saphronia, now a first grader, sat in her old kindergarten classroom at P.S. 
95 in Brooklyn and talked haltingly about the bombing and the last year. Her 
mother, Deborah, says her daughter has been seeing a therapist once a week. 
</P>
<P>
 She tells of nightmares "about the elevators, being in the dark." And she 
recalls the vanilla and chocolate-chip ice cream that was waiting for the 
children when they returned, at last, to their school. 
</P>
<P>
 Saphronia and other children from her class are still struggling to overcome 
the trauma of that winter afternoon -- the smoke, the darkness, the sound of 
their small fists banging on elevator walls for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are experiencing sharp mood swings -- sudden spells of anger and bouts of 
crying, as well as periods of withdrawal from their families. Nightmares still 
interrupt their sleep. One girl is still wetting her bed. Another has breathing 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But other children came out of the ordeal apparently unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Kornak, 7, suffered no ill effects from the smoke, experienced no 
sleepless nights, has no fear of the dark and doesn't object to elevators, said 
his mother, Elizabeth. 
</P>
<P>
 How does she explain his resiliency? "He fell asleep most of the time in the 
elevator, so he didn't know what was going on," Elizabeth Kornak said. 
</P>
<P>
 Florence Manglani, the school psychologist, said about a third of the 17 
children stuck in the elevator had extreme reactions to the experience. At 
least three have sought therapy outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Taina Rodriguez, 6, will get in an elevator -- but only if her father is with 
her, says her mother, Millie. And then she will have such a look of terror that 
Rodriguez wonders if they shouldn't just let her take the stairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "She stares at the window of the door that closes and she will just stare at 
it and count '1, 2, 3' to herself like that and if we talk, she will not 
listen, her mind is just at each floor as she counts them." 
</P>
<P>
 Taina is seeing a psychiatrist, as is her mother, who was with her daughter on 
the Trade Center trip. She pleads to move to Oklahoma, where her aunt lives, 
Rodriguez says, because she thinks "there are no elevators . . . no big 
buildings there." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is Dena Ortiz, also 6. Her mother, Shirley Perez, says the child 
suffers from breathing problems that she never had before the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
 At school last spring, she hyperventilated and had to be taken by ambulance to 
a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 When fall came, Dena refused to go back to P.S. 95, and her mother transferred 
her to a new school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to go there because of the trips," Dena said in her family's 
small third-floor walk-up above an Italian eatery in Brooklyn.

GIBBONS SNATCHED FROM WILD FIND THEY HAVE SOME FRIENDS IN THAILAND; WILDLIFE: 
THE APES ARE PRIME TARGETS OF POACHERS, WHO KILL MOTHERS AND SELL INFANTS AS 
PETS. AN UNUSUAL PROGRAM AIMS TO RETURN THEM TO THE JUNGLE.

 "Vernon" used to hang around Nina's Bar in funny clothes to attract customers. 
"Bo" was ripped away from his slain mother as a baby. "King Kong" tried to make 
friends with a rubber-tapper and got stabbed in return. 
</P>
<P>
 The three are among thousands of gibbons -- highly intelligent, sensitive and 
appealing animals -- variously victimized by man. They're going through an 
unusual program that may allow them to return to their own world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every gibbon here has suffered a trauma," said Terrance Dillon Morin, an 
American zoologist and documentary filmmaker who heads the Gibbon 
Rehabilitation Project on this tropical island off southwestern Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 Highly sought after as pets and fetching a high price on the illegal 
international wildlife market, gibbons are prime targets for poachers, who kill 
the mothers to grab their infants. 
</P>
<P>
 Many are cruelly kept in small cages or on short chains. On reaching maturity, 
the apes are frequently abandoned if they turn aggressive. Others are coddled 
and literally loved to death because they're unable to cope outside their human 
habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 Although paraded around one of many bars in Phuket which once kept gibbons, 
Vernon was well treated by a woman who turned him over to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trouble was that Vernon thought he was human. It took us a long time to 
convince him that he was indeed a gibbon," said Morin. "He had not been with 
his own kind since not long after birth." 
</P>
<P>
 Given land in a wildlife sanctuary by the Thai government, Morin installed 
large cages on a forested hillside. Proper food, medical help and exercise help 
restore the gibbons' lost muscle tone and incredible acrobatic skills, while 
the caring keepers try to heal psychic wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to take them back to their childhood so they can learn to play and 
sing their songs," said the 51-year-old director. "Here in the forest they get 
reintroduced to the smells and sounds of the jungle. We hope it triggers some 
primal memories." 
</P>
<P>
 Morin is taking care of 27 gibbons at Phuket and five on Ko Boi, a remote, 
uninhabited nearby island where animals regarded as fit are released into the 
wild. A pair recently set free has begun to mate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I run a gibbon dating service," joked Morin, noting that he must try to 
figure out who will be attracted to whom. Gibbons take their time courting and 
remain faithful partners for life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that in seven months we'll have a baby gibbon. That's the ultimate 
success," said Morin, a Honolulu resident who started the project three years 
ago after seeing the plight of Phuket's captive gibbons. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined up with Leonie Vejjajiva, a British woman residing in Bangkok who 
has championed gibbons since the mid-1980s and started the Wild Animal Rescue 
Foundation of Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 She cares for 59 primates, 30 of them gibbons, in her back garden. Vejjajiva 
says there are about 400 gibbons on the waiting list for her "halfway house," 
with perhaps several thousand others being kept in Bangkok alone. 
</P>
<P>
 They will soon be moved to a plot of government land in a nearby province and 
eventually to wildlife sanctuaries to restock dramatically depleted wild 
populations. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Vejjajiva and Morin see some hope in Thailand. Hunting appears to have 
decreased, and a 1992 law says all owners must register their animals. But more 
gibbons, along with other wildlife, have been smuggled into the country from 
Cambodia, Myanmar, Vietnam and Laos. 
</P>
<P>
 On Phuket, the project has drawn support from the local community. Gibbons 
have all but disappeared from the bars. Fewer tourists seem to be buying baby 
gibbons or trying to smuggle them out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 On one recent morning, a steady stream of foreigners and Thais visited the 
project, donating cash, buying T-shirts and learning about gibbons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy" and "Bruce" hugged each other like human sweethearts after coming out of 
sedation for a medical exam. In the "kindergarten" cage, youngsters played tag. 
</P>
<P>
 A German-Italian couple pulled up with "Olivia," a 6-year-old female with 
golden brown hair they had come to turn over. They had bought her for $140, but 
she suffered from bouts of depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivia swung atop the counter while Morin wrote up her history and habits. 
"She loves children. She likes to hug them," her owner explained. "But she 
doesn't like Thai people because they tease gibbons. Gibbons have long 
memories." 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, out of the forest, came the Great Call, the haunting song sung only 
by the female of the species. It began on a confident note but then began to 
falter. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's Pepsi. She's a youngster and doesn't know her lines yet," Morin 
quipped. "But she's learning."

DULL BROWN TASMANIAN POPPIES BRING IN GREEN; OPIUM: THE DRIED FLOWER HEADS ARE 
SOLD TO TWO PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, NETTING ABOUT 600 GROWERS $6.8 MILLION TO 
$8.1 MILLION A YEAR.

<P>
 Every year, one of the world's most tempting crops tints fields a seductive 
white and mauve on the Australian island of Tasmania. 
</P>
<P>
 The opium-poppy fields eventually turn a banal brown in the hot sun, which 
gives them the consistency of straw. It's then, usually in March -- a summer 
month down here -- that they have the most allure for farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 The dried poppies are sold to two pharmaceutical companies, bringing about 600 
growers $6.8 million to $8.1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a relatively new income source for Tasmania. The first commercial crop 
was produced in 1970, and large-scale production began a few years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Poppies were introduced to the island by one of the two drug companies, Glaxo 
of Great Britain, which had been seeking a secure new source of the valuable 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tasmania," according to a government statement, "offered a good combination 
of climate, soil and experienced farmers, a small, law-abiding community with 
virtually no drug problems and, above all, a remote location." 
</P>
<P>
 Glaxo and the other company, Tasmanian Alkaloids, a subsidiary of the U.S. 
corporation Johnson & Johnson, convert the harvest into a substance known as 
poppy-straw concentrate, from which morphine is extracted, principally to 
produce codeine. 
</P>
<P>
 Australia produces 35% to 40% of the world's morphine. Tasmania holds the 
record yield per acre for morphine and supplies roughly 25% of the world's 
codeine. 
</P>
<P>
 In pill form, codeine relieves pain after operations or tooth extractions; in 
syrups, it soothes coughs. Both codeine and morphine are key ingredients in 
millions of prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 For additional income, growers separate poppy seed from the flowers for food 
seasoning. Blue poppy seeds such as those produced in Tasmania command the 
highest price on the international spice market. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at the multiplier effect on the local community by way of 
processing, crop transport, labor, fertilizers and the like, we estimate the 
value of the poppy to Tasmania is in the vicinity of $40.8 million to $47.6 
million annually," said Julian Green, chairman of the Poppy Advisory and 
Control Board of Tasmania. 
</P>
<P>
 Protecting these economic stakes has a high priority, and officials here say 
that diversion of poppies for illicit uses is minuscule -- the equivalent of 
2.2 pounds of morphine -- compared with the diversion from other poppy-growing 
areas of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Raising the crop on an island with a population of slightly more than 450,000 
helps. Drug users rarely escape notice in the island's tightly knit 
communities, and smuggling is difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 But the best security is the alliance between the police and the growers. 
Poppy farmers, who must renew their licenses annually, are expected to notify 
police immediately of any strange vehicles or people. Following farmers' leads, 
police often stake out fields at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Brown, a security specialist with the control board and a former 
detective, said the tight surveillance works because "nobody's going to warn 
off culprits." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown once asked for police help in apprehending poppy thieves on an obscure 
hilltop. "They caught two women who'd been making a little feast of the place," 
he said. "We called it 'the supermarket.' " 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the minimal security problems, Tasmanian farmers and the drug 
companies have been able to concentrate on increasing production, which has 
become more mechanized. Precision machinery seeds and fertilizes fields, sprays 
herbicides and harvests the dried flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis on efficiency is paying off. "We're getting about 3.3 pounds of 
morphine per ton of crop," estimates Wayne Smith, president of the island's 
poppy growers' association. "And every year we're looking at new cultivars to 
increase that yield." 
</P>
<P>
 With wool prices falling -- wool exports are one of the largest sources of 
income on the island -- the poppy trade has become increasingly important. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a great help to our cash flow and net farm income," grower Michael 
Crisp said. Crisp usually plants about 37 acres in poppies. The average spread 
is closer to 25 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 The average gross return from the crop is about $680 to $800 per acre, 
according to the Poppy Advisory and Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers plant their poppies in different fields each year to help their other 
crops. Poppy roots tunnel as much as six feet into the soil. "We find that they 
bust up the old subsoil, so it's all ready for ordinary food crops such as 
onions or potatoes," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that bothers the island's poppy farmers is the rather static market 
for their crop, most of which goes to England and Europe. Under U.S. law, 
India, and to a lesser extent Turkey, command 80% of the lucrative U.S. market 
for legal unprocessed narcotics. The law is based on the belief that their 
domination of the market helps control opium smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
 But this strategy may not be working. A U.S. State Department report estimates 
that as much as 10% to 30% of India's opium crop is being diverted to the 
illicit drug market. The United States has given India two years either to stem 
the seepage or face reduced U.S. opium imports. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolstered by its exemplary security record, Tasmania would be eager to pick up 
the slack.

POSTAL HEIST PROBE LEADS TO LATIN AMERICA; CRIME: THIEVES WOULD TAKE ENVELOPES 
FROM HOME MAIL BOXES AND LAUNDER ANY CHECKS THEY FOUND THROUGH FOREIGN BANKS. 
FIVE PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED IN JANUARY, BUT THAT DOES NOT SATISFY AT LEAST TWO 
ANGRY VICTIMS.

 Carolyn Ditzian doesn't send mail from her house anymore -- she can't be sure 
who will cash her utility or tax payments. Her friend Ann Prochaska feels the 
same way. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were victims of a scheme in which thousands of dollars worth of personal 
checks were stolen from home mail boxes where they awaited pickup by mail 
carriers, and then laundered through Latin American banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the women -- who live miles apart -- were eventually reimbursed by U.S. 
banks that processed the checks, they say the incident has convinced them the 
sanctity of the U.S. mail is a fallacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to repay everybody until I was reimbursed," said Prochaska, of suburban 
Davie. Checks of hers worth $4,000 were stolen last February. "I was just 
angry. I felt violated. I've never had anybody rob the house, but it felt the 
same." 
</P>
<P>
 Ditzian, who lost checks worth more than $5,000, including her property tax 
payment, said that initially no one wanted to hear her story. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I called police, they didn't even take a report on it," said 
Ditzian, 62, of Broward County. "The post office was absolutely no help at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, says Postal Inspector Henry Gutierrez, who infiltrated the scam. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal agents in January arrested five men, two from Argentina and three from 
Miami. All are charged with possession of stolen mail and could face 10 years 
in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez said he identified the main check fence and said money-laundering 
charges are pending. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's still thieves down the line out there," Gutierrez said. "But they 
have no way of laundering the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez said the men stole more than 1,000 checks worth about $1 million -- 
ranging from a 25-cent highway toll fee to a $42,000 check, and including 
everything from utility payments to catalogue orders. 
</P>
<P>
 The checks were then sold to middlemen who deposited them in bank accounts 
opened under the names of fictitious businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The accounts were throughout Latin America: Costa Rica, Brazil, Mexico, 
Guatemala, Bolivia, Peru, Argentina and Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are talking about a great number of banks as well as individuals," 
Gutierrez said. "They'd cash checks in Costa Rica and then they moved over to 
Mexico. Obviously, they were very active." 
</P>
<P>
 In January, postal and Florida Department of Law Enforcement agents 
intercepted a package, destined for Brazil, that contained more than 100 stolen 
checks worth $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The scam took advantage of lax banking laws in Latin America that allowed 
accomplices to stamp the backs of the checks with official-looking endorsements 
for deposit, Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you cash a check, you submit ID, but when you deposit a check you don't 
really look. . . . It's a big difference," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he questions how these Latin American banks could accept thousands of 
dollars of checks made out to third parties and not get suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Ditzian and Prochaska both complain the Postal Service never 
returned their calls and they don't know if the five men arrested were the ones 
responsible for lifting their mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Ditzian said she had to pay about $500 in interest and penalties because her 
property tax check never reached the county assessor. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think these five are the end of it, it is not the end of it," she 
said. "There are 25 more that have the same idea . . . and it's going to 
continue."

HAWAII GUN BUYERS HURRY TO BEAT BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A move in the Hawaii Legislature to impose a strict ban on firearms has 
generated a surge in gun sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had 68 requests, or about twice as many as usual, for firearms permits 
Thursday, the day after the proposed ban was approved by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun retailers said their stores were filled with buyers and browsers and they 
expect even more business if the legislation passes the House. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate approved a bill that would ban the import, sale or transfer of any 
handgun in Hawaii and another measure that would require the registration of 
all firearms. Currently, rifles and shotguns purchased in Hawaii do not have to 
be registered. 
</P>
<P>
 House Speaker Joseph Souki said the House will act on gun control but probably 
will approve less-restrictive measures.

'DIALING 911 WITH DIGNITY' IN DELAWARE; HEALTH: THOSE WHO ROUTINELY VISIT HOMES 
ARE TRAINED TO SPOT PROBLEMS. IN ONE CASE, A TELEPHONE WORKER'S CONCERN SAVED A 
WOMAN'S LIFE. 
</P>

<P>
 A telephone worker who had to make two consecutive visits to an older woman's 
home saw a marked change in her the second day. 
</P>
<P>
 He persuaded her to let him call for help. When a nurse and social worker 
arrived, they found the woman in cardiac arrest. Fortunately, they were able to 
get her to a hospital and save her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Burger, president of Bell Atlantic Delaware, cited the case recently 
as an example of the benefits of the Gatekeeper Program. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Division of Aging announced the expansion of the program, which puts 
utility workers and others on the alert for problems in the homes of older 
people and disabled adults. Bell Atlantic Delaware was among seven companies 
that signed up Jan. 11, meaning that several hundred workers will be joining 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be looking at banks, pharmacies and food markets because they 
come into contact with older people on a day-to-day basis," said Eleanor Cain, 
aging division director. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, employees of the participating companies will be trained to 
identify the elderly and physically disabled who may need help. They will be 
trained to observe -- during routine service calls -- whether the person's home 
is in disarray, whether the person appears confused, has a medical impairment, 
such as a hearing problem, or whether the person has neglected his or her 
personal appearance, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 If the employees think there are problems, they will notify the contact person 
with their company who has been designated as the liaison with the state. That 
person then makes the referral to the state, which follows up with a visit by a 
social worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Cain noted, however, that not every referral results in help for the person in 
need because they may refuse assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had people refuse. An adult has the right to live as they choose," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack F. McCarthy, deputy assistant secretary for aging under the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services, said Delaware is the first state to 
expand the Gatekeeper program statewide. The Gatekeeper concept began in 1978 
in Spokane, Wash., and has been adopted around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The program started in Delaware in 1989 with an agreement between the state 
and the Delmarva Power & Light Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the program began, DP&L has made nearly 400 referrals to the state. Gary 
Fullman, public relations manager for DP&L, said one meter reader described the 
program as "dialing 911 with dignity." 
</P>
<P>
 With help from the businesses, the state will be able to help elderly and 
disabled people who may be unaware of the state services available to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The help and assistance the people receive (through the program) will enable 
them to live independently. We are helping a vulnerable population," said 
Muriel Rusten, deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Social 
Services.

QUESTIONS URGED ON DESIPRAMINE; MEDICINE: PRESCRIBED FOR A VARIETY OF CHILDHOOD 
ILLS, THE DRUG HAS BEEN LINKED TO SUDDEN, UNEXPLAINED DEATHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MALCOLM RITTER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents of children who take a medication called desipramine should discuss 
its use with the prescribing doctor, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug has been widely prescribed to children for hyperactivity, depression 
and bed-wetting at least since the early 1970s. But in the last few years it 
has been linked to several sudden, unexplained deaths in children. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Barbara Geller of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. 
Louis, who investigates use of psychiatric medicines in children, said 
psychiatrists have been concerned for several years about the possibility of 
sudden death in children taking desipramine. 
</P>
<P>
 She said caution should be exercised when children or adolescents take any 
drug of this class (called tricyclics), including imipramine, nortriptyline and 
chlomipramine. Imipramine is prescribed for bed-wetting more often than 
desipramine. 
</P>
<P>
 Desipramine is the tricyclic most commonly prescribed for children, which may 
explain why it has received more attention, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dr. Mark Riddle, director of the division of child and adolescent 
psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University, said he is particularly concerned about 
desipramine because of the reports of children's deaths in medical journals and 
the way the drug acts in the body. 
</P>
<P>
 The topic made the news again late last year. The Register-Guard of Eugene, 
Ore., reported that Food and Drug Administration records linked desipramine and 
imipramine to nearly 80 deaths in children since the early 1970s, and more 
deaths may have actually occurred. The reported number included at least a 
dozen suicides and a similar number of accidental overdoses. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dr. Sandra Kweder, acting director of FDA's division of epidemiology and 
surveillance, told the Associated Press that she could not comment on the 
reported total of deaths without knowing more details. 
</P>
<P>
 Desipramine's official prescribing guidelines include a warning about use in 
children. "Our position is that desipramine should not be used in children," 
said Richard Johnson, spokesman for Marion Merrell Dow Inc., one of several 
makers of desipramine. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Arbesfeld of Ciba-Geigy Corp., which makes imipramine, said the company 
was aware of 13 deaths since 1973 in children taking that drug. Ten were 
overdoses, two involved a child taking multiple drugs and one death was 
apparently due to injuries from child abuse, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has not seen any reports of death from the drug's use at 
recommended doses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Geller advised parents of children or adolescents who take any tricyclic to 
discuss it with the prescribing doctor so "they can make informed decision 
about continuing with this medication." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents should make sure that every time the dose level is increased, the 
child's blood levels are checked and an electrocardiogram is performed, she 
said. If that has not happened, parents should get a second opinion from 
another doctor, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, before starting any tricyclic the child should have a thorough 
physical examination, including an electrocardiogram, and there should be no 
family history of sudden death in relatives younger than 40, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons for the deaths in children taking desipramine or imipramine are 
not always known, Geller said. Apart from suicides, accidental overdoses and 
interactions with other medications, they could include causes unrelated to the 
drugs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a lot more research and investigation (into the reported deaths), and 
doctors need to be very careful in prescribing (the drugs) until there's more 
information," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern over desipramine (pronounced day-ZIP-ra-meen) dates from June, 1990, 
when a medical publication reported three cases of children who died while 
taking the drug, Riddle said. He and colleagues reported a fourth death last 
July. 
</P>
<P>
 The children were two 8-year-old boys, a 9-year-old boy and a 12-year-old 
girl. None had taken an overdose, Riddle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riddle said he thinks desipramine is still used fairly widely, but far less 
than it was before the 1990 report. "I think that many, many clinicians are 
concerned. Although this risk may be very small, sudden death of a child is 
obviously a big deal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Geller said they think that psychiatrists who specialize in treating 
children and adolescents are generally informing parents of the risks of 
desipramine, because the topic has been stressed at professional meetings and 
in journals. Riddle said it is not clear whether that awareness campaign has 
reached other doctors who can prescribe the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 The federally regulated official guidelines for prescribing desipramine warn 
that the drug is not recommended for use in children, because safety and 
effectiveness in them has not been established. They also warn that there have 
been several reports of sudden death in children. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors can still legally prescribe the drug in children in what is called 
"off-label" use. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors who treat children often prescribe off-label because of a lack of 
information about many medications in children, Riddle said. "If I didn't 
prescribe off-label, my ability to treat children effectively would be severely 
limited," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some studies have shown desipramine to be safe and effective in children, but 
the research has not met the FDA's criteria for changing the prescribing 
guidelines, Riddle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Desipramine "has been a big help to a lot of my patients" with depression or 
hyperactivity, Riddle said. But "I'm concerned about the drug and I don't use 
it unless I need to. . . . I'm finding that most of the time I can provide 
quality care to my patients without using it." 
</P>
<P>
 Geller said the decision whether to use desipramine can be complex, involving 
a weighing of risks and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 While there are several drugs for treating hyperactivity, she said, some 
children respond best to desipramine. And since hyperactivity can lead to drug 
abuse and a tendency for minor and major accidents, withdrawing desipramine 
from one of those children would have its own risks, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, for depressed children who respond particularly well to 
desipramine, "if you take it away, (they) may kill themselves. So again it's a 
risk-benefit ratio that's very complicated."

INHALANTS OF CHOICE ARE ONLY A STORE AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA SESSIONS STEPP, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Inhalants are popular because they're cheap, accessible and perceived as safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Sniffing often begins innocently, said Lawrence Brain, a psychiatrist who 
specializes in adolescent drug abuse at the Psychiatric Institute of 
Washington. "A kid gets hold of gasoline from a mower and starts inhaling that, 
or magic markers . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 The same youngster may walk into a hardware store, open up a can of paint 
thinner, put some of it on his jacket and leave, said Officer Tony Werner of 
the Anne Arundel County (Md.) police. "You don't need a bag; you can just walk 
around pretending you're wiping your nose." 
</P>
<P>
 The youth then may proceed to the potpourri scent of an air freshener. If he 
can't find it in the house pantry, he can acquire it at any grocery store for 
$1.35. A cigarette lighter containing butane can deliver the same effect for 
$2.39. 
</P>
<P>
 Convenience stores in Anne Arundel County report that on Friday nights they 
often sell out of the fluid, Werner said. When a 15-year-old cheerleader 
collapsed and died after sniffing butane, county police tried to discourage 
store owners from selling the fluid to minors, Werner said, "but we couldn't 
make them, because it's legal." 
</P>
<P>
 "(Inhalants) are kids' way around illegal drugs," Werner continued. "Kids 
don't have to worry about going out on the street, or getting shot; they can 
just walk in a market and get it." 
</P>
<P>
 And if they are caught, they have a ready excuse -- "I smoke" or "I'm working 
on a model airplane" -- said Fairfax (Va.) police officer Bill Baitinger, 
former liaison to Chantilly High School. The last two school years, he said, 
butane and glue were the inhalants of choice there. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes no money is needed; Lauren Diedrich of Lackey High School in Charles 
County, Md., said she has friends who steal Freon from a neighbor who works at 
an air-conditioning company. Peter Tretick, another Lackey student, said he 
knows a park where a tank of nitrous oxide is readily available. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whippets" of nitrous oxide, manufactured for whipping-cream dispensers, also 
can be purchased at retail stores and are passed around freely at concerts and 
all-night dance parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Trent Tschirgi, assistant director of the office of substance-abuse studies at 
the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, said he was searching for a 
seltzer charger at a specialty store in his neighborhood mall when he spied six 
rows of nitrous oxide bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mostly it's teen-agers who buy this stuff," a clerk told him. "They put it in 
a balloon at a party and snort it, and it doesn't hurt anybody."

 It started out like any other Saturday night for the vivacious 15-year-old: 
lounging on the couch at a friend's town house, catching a movie on the VCR 
with several classmates from school. Twice, according to one friend, she 
stepped outside for a "huff" and popped back in a couple of minutes later. The 
third time, she didn't come back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jen's passed out!" someone yelled, and several teens rushed out, having heard 
a loud thump as if a body had hit the deck. There the girl lay in her blue 
jeans, peach shirt and blue Vans sneakers, unconscious, a propane tank hose by 
her side. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Leigh Hoover, a sophomore at Lackey High School in Charles County, 
Md., died that night last fall of cardiac arrest after inhaling propane gas 
from an outdoor grill. 
</P>
<P>
 In search of a 2-minute high, she added her name to a growing number of young, 
often middle-class teen-agers who sniff the fumes from aerosol sprays, paint 
thinner, gasoline and other ordinary household products for cheap, and 
sometimes deadly, thrills. 
</P>
<P>
 Sniffing has been around as long as model-airplane glue and gasoline pumps, 
but the last few years have witnessed what an article in the New England 
Journal of Medicine calls abuse "of epidemic proportions." 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 338,000 U.S. youth ages 12-17 reported sniffing inhalants within 
the previous month, according to a 1992 study by the National Institute on Drug 
Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Another federal survey found that inhalant use is growing. In 1975, 10% of 
high school seniors reported such behavior; in 1992, 17% did so. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Inhalants) are becoming a real popular form of chemical abuse," said Scott 
Ellis, a drug counselor in Lincoln, Neb., who worked with three 5-year-olds 
caught sniffing gasoline out of baby food jars. "A lot of kids and their 
families don't see it as doing drugs, but it's like riding a bike down the hill 
without your brakes. You may make it and you may not." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer's parents, Nancy and Berk Hoover, didn't see the crash coming. They 
say they talked to Jenny several times about illegal drugs, especially after 
she started smoking an occasional cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, Dad," she'd say to Berk, "I wouldn't do anything like that." She even 
joined the high-school chapter of Students Against Drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never even thought there might be something right in the home," said 
Nancy, sitting in the cozy kitchen of their small house in Indian Head, Md. 
"After they're 10 years old and can read the labels, you don't talk about the 
stuff under the sink." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't understand it," Nancy continued, her eyes filling with tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Patrick Hoover, Jennifer's older brother, offered a clue: Jennifer was a 
curious sort. "She probably saw someone else do it, and it didn't kill them, so 
she thought she'd just try it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Sgt. Robert Cleaveland, the county detective who is investigating 
Jennifer's death, she had recently started hanging out with a group of about 20 
boys and girls, some of whom began experimenting with propane gas last summer. 
Propane was only the latest in a number of gases some students had tried, 
according to several Lackey classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of kids do Freon," one boy said during lunch in the school cafeteria a 
couple of weeks after Jennifer died. "You put it in a plastic bag and breathe 
in. If you take a hit out of a can, it'll freeze your lungs." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've used propane a little," said another boy. "Also Freon, nitrous oxide. . 
. . I did it just to experiment." 
</P>
<P>
 Lauren Diedrich, who drove Jennifer Hoover to the town house that ill-fated 
night, said her friends get high on inhalants because "it's fun, like getting 
drunk or something." Jennifer told her she liked propane, because "it makes you 
laugh," said Lauren, who also said she'd never tried it. "I don't think she 
knew it could kill her." 
</P>
<P>
 Young people seek out inhalants because they feel they can control them, said 
Neil Rosenberg, founder of the International Institute for Inhalant Abuse. 
"They can sniff just enough and get high, or a lot and hallucinate." 
</P>
<P>
 Lauren Diedrich said Jennifer told her that when she inhaled propane, she'd 
see "checkers or polka dots." 
</P>
<P>
 Another student said that after a prolonged whiff, the huffer hears "Pac-Man 
sounds. . . . 'Wah, wah, wah' " 
</P>
<P>
 What's happening to those huffers, said Trent Tschirgi of the University of 
Maryland School of Pharmacy, is that the chemicals are replacing oxygen in the 
blood, making the heart beat irregularly and altering breathing. Death can 
occur instantly (called "sudden sniffing death") the first time one huffs or 
the 50th, from cardiac arrhythmia, respiratory failure or a sudden release of 
adrenaline. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 60 American youths died last year from sniffing, according to the 
inhalant-abuse institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who don't die can suffer serious damage. After six months of regular 
use, the brain, lungs, nerves, liver, kidneys and bones may be permanently 
damaged, according to the institute's Rosenberg, a neurologist who has examined 
dozens of brain scans of serious sniffers. 
</P>
<P>
 Abusers may mimic victims of Alzheimer's disease, suffering from "chronic 
memory problems (and) major difficulties with reading, writing and arithmetic," 
he said. In terms of coordination, "they look like a staggering drunk." They 
suffer vision problems and hearing difficulties, and it's not unusual to see 
abusers in their 20s wearing hearing aids. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the presence of inhalants is not picked up in the routine screening 
after death, inhalant abuse "has gone largely unreported" in the United States, 
an article in the New England Journal of Medicine said in December, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our research . . . leads us to believe that abuse of these readily available 
inhalants has reached epidemic proportions," authors Earl Siegel and Suman 
Wason wrote, "indicating an urgent need for preventive efforts directed at 
teen-agers and their parents, with an emphasis on the risk of sudden death from 
sniffing."

POLICE IMPOSTORS POSE A PERSISTENT THREAT; PROTECTION: IN NEW YORK, 
APPROXIMATELY 1,300 COMPLAINTS WERE FILED ABOUT IMPERSONATIONS LAST YEAR. EASY 
AVAILABILITY OF PHONY BADGES AND OTHER GEAR ADDS TO PROBLEM. 
</P>

 The clean-cut man looked like a plainclothes police officer, carried a gun 
like one, even flashed a badge like one. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he ordered a 19-year-old woman into his car, he acted like what he 
really was -- a sex offender, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man forced the woman to perform oral sex on him before letting her go, she 
told police. The next day, Maxie Tindal, a 30-year-old letter carrier, was 
arrested and charged with sodomy, criminal possession of a weapon and 
impersonating a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 His arrest highlighted a persistent problem in a city that employs more than 
30,000 police officers. Last year, the Police Department handled about 1,300 
complaints involving police impostors, including 400 robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 In one recent week, police arrested two suspects who told their victims they 
were officers: a school security guard who handcuffed a woman before sexually 
assaulting her, and a 19-year-old man who pistol-whipped and robbed an elderly 
man who let him in the front door. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail of crime and deception threatens to further erode a reputation 
damaged by recent accusations of corruption against real officers, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The impersonators "are really making it bad for cops," said Lt. Robert 
DiVagno, commander of a newly formed unit charged with combatting the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Formed in January, the 18-member investigative unit is looking for patterns in 
recent robberies and other crimes committed by suspects who gain trust and 
access by posing as police officers, DiVagno said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Tindal carried a detective's gold shield -- possibly a real one 
that was stolen -- a loaded .45-caliber handgun, a flashing dome light and an 
expired police parking pass. 
</P>
<P>
 When he saw the victim on a secluded Bronx street Jan. 25, he showed her his 
badge and his gun and accused her of being a prostitute. He threatened to 
arrest her unless she had sex with him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Tindal the next night as he cruised the same area. 
</P>
<P>
 Impostors use their false authority for everything from beating subway fares 
to pulling jewelry heists. Often, they steal from drug dealers, prostitutes and 
other petty criminals who are less likely to report robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 Police already know that the fake officers often outfit themselves with 
replica badges, handcuffs and nightsticks purchased from mail-order firms that 
advertise in true crime magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 Civilian possession of a shield stating "City of New York Police," real or 
fake, is a misdemeanor. But police admit they can do little about badges coming 
into the city. 
</P>
<P>
 One company, International Police Equipment Co. of Perris, Calif., offers a 
variety of "professional" badges by mail for $6.95 each. Also available are 
badge cases that allow the carrier to "flash your badge in an official manner," 
a magazine ad says. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's legitimate market is for private investigators and collectors, 
said manager Joyce Smith. The company refuses to fill orders from customers it 
finds suspicious, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try very hard to make sure nobody who shouldn't have a badge gets one," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, fake shields often end up in the hands of criminals. Perhaps the most 
infamous was the "Hillside Strangler," Kenneth Bianchi. Bianchi was known to 
flash a bogus badge at victims during his killing spree in the Los Angeles area 
in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 When a crook carries a shield, "most people tend to think they're dealing with 
a cop, sometimes even after that, quote, 'cop' commits a crime," DiVagno said.

FARM CREDIT BANKS ON REBOUND AFTER MONEY WOES; AGRICULTURE: IN THE '80S, SYSTEM 
WAS NEAR COLLAPSE. BUT CONSOLIDATION AND REORGANIZATION TURNED IT AROUND -- SO 
MUCH SO THAT OMAHA BANK OFFERED TO LET FLOOD VICTIMS HALT PAYMENTS FOR A YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When record rainfall and flooding hit the Midwest last summer, the Farm Credit 
Bank of Omaha proposed to let its 20,000 borrowers in the disaster area off the 
hook. 
</P>
<P>
 The customers in Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota could defer paying their real 
estate loans for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 No member of the Farm Credit system could have made that offer in the 
mid-1980s. The network of borrower-owned institutions was near collapse as the 
farm economy went through a shakedown. 
</P>
<P>
 But seven years into its government-engineered rescue plan, the system is 
about to announce 1993 earnings that could hit $1 billion. In 1985 and 1986, 
the government-chartered lenders in the system had lost $5 billion in bad 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
 With fewer and more tightly supervised banks, the system has also repaid 
virtually all the $1.3 billion it borrowed, more than nine years ahead of 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Congress who helped engineer the recovery say it worked without 
costing taxpayers. Nor did the government become a major landlord, as in the 
much larger savings and loan bailout. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there was ever the case where the government did something that worked and 
worked extremely well, it's with the farm credit system," said Sen. Kent Conrad 
(D-N.D.), chairman of the Senate Agriculture subcommittee on credit. 
</P>
<P>
 The system cut its overhead, merging 36 farmer lending banks into 11, and 
nearly 1,000 local lending associations into 238. It allowed borrowers to defer 
payments and cut their interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The system's network of lending banks for farm and utility cooperatives also 
shrank from 12 to three. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the system wants to find ways to make more business, agricultural export, 
real estate and utility loans. Its leaders contend that a system that began in 
1916 to aid producers needs to keep up with fundamental changes in rural 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is looking at ways to help the rural economy with 
more spending on housing, water treatment and sewage systems, giving the system 
more room to ask for a stronger presence. 
</P>
<P>
 But commercial bankers are fighting the push. They argue that the Farm Credit 
system shouldn't benefit from special government treatment and risk taxpayer 
money to compete with private institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all for their doing well, but we think they should be staying within 
their charter," said Ed Alwood, spokesman for the American Bankers Assn. "We 
remain unconvinced that there's a need out there that the banks are not 
meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 The farm economy has recovered since the 1980s, when a collapse in commodity 
prices depressed the value of land used to secure loans. Private banks have 
been reporting record profits too, but there's a shrinking pool of traditional 
farm borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
 The private banks took away farm credit customers in the 1980s when the system 
had to pay more to borrow than it could charge customers. It lends to about 
one-fourth of agriculture borrowers now, compared with more than a third just 
10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, low interest rates favor the system, which sells bonds at just a smidgen 
above the low Treasury rate. There are no depositors. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the securities aren't really backed by the government, some federal 
guarantee is implied. Some favorable tax treatment and the highest rating, AAA, 
by Moody's Investor Service Inc. have helped. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are some lingering soft spots. About 4% of its $53.3 billion in 
loans are in a "non-performing" or troubled category. And the General 
Accounting Office recently reported that some banks can lend too much to too 
few borrowers, creating risks. 
</P>
<P>
 But being picky may be what helped the Omaha bank make its offer to flood 
victims. Disaster aid and high prices for surplus crops helped many growers 
through the bad year. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, only 1,000 of the 20,000 eligible borrowers asked to take advantage of 
the reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quality of the portfolio is like gang busters," said spokesman John 
Scherle. "They've got the assets and the wherewithal to handle the year without 
taking too big of a hit."

MANAGED CARE INDUSTRY CAUGHT BETWEEN HIGH COSTS, PATIENT WELFARE; INSURANCE: A 
$90-MILLION JUDGMENT AGAINST AN HMO HIGHLIGHTS THE CONFLICT. BUT SOME EXPERTS 
CONTEND THAT LIMITS ON COVERAGE HELP PREVENT WIDESPREAD USE OF POTENTIALLY 
HARMFUL TREATMENTS BEFORE THEY ARE PROVEN EFFECTIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIANN CAPRINO, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just after Christmas, a California jury awarded nearly $90 million to the 
family of a woman who died after her health maintenance organization refused to 
pay for a costly, experimental breast cancer treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The size of the award, which stunned the health care industry, underscored 
more than just the age-old battle between patients and insurers. For millions 
of Americans, particularly those obliged to join HMOs at their employers' 
request, the case cut to their worst fears about the new era of managed care. 
</P>
<P>
 It offered a stinging example of what managed-care critics call the HMO 
obsession with cost, even if that means withholding medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney for Nelene Fox charged in the nearly monthlong trial that Health 
Net's contract covered bone-marrow transplants and that the HMO financially 
rewarded executives for denying coverage of costly procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 The company argued it only pays for the transplants under certain, proven 
conditions, not those that are experimental or have only the slightest chance 
for success. 
</P>
<P>
 Transplanting bone marrow is a routine procedure for patients with such 
diseases as leukemia. But it is considered of unknown benefit for patients like 
Fox, who had advanced metastatic breast cancer, and typically it is not covered 
by insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Hieper, Fox's attorney and also her brother, called the victory an 
"indictment on managed care." 
</P>
<P>
 If the award is upheld, "it flies in the face of managed care and would have a 
very negative effect" on the industry, said Thomas Hodapp, a senior health care 
analyst with Roberts Stephens & Co., a San Francisco investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a big concern for the precedent it sets," he said of the case, 
believed to be the first of its kind tried before a jury. "There will be a lot 
more (lawsuits) coming down the pike" if the award stands. 
</P>
<P>
 But the case is not that simple. Many experts believe that Health Net, the 
second-largest HMO in California, acted properly and that it is virtually 
certain the award will be reduced, perhaps to just a few million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Some even argue that limits on insurance coverage help prevent widespread use 
of potentially harmful treatments before they are proven effective. There are 
plenty of examples of patients who suffered from experimental therapies later 
found worthless or even damaging. 
</P>
<P>
 A few decades ago, for example, doctors tried freezing the stomachs of ulcer 
patients. "It was not only useless, it was harmful," said Dr. Alan Hillman, 
director of the Center for Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too bad that the American public is pushing the profession to use 
everything before it is fully tested," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the Fox family, anything that offered even a shred of hope was worth 
pursuing, and at any price. "If there's an outside chance of a cure, you want 
to do it," said Fox's husband, James, after the award. 
</P>
<P>
 With help from friends, 40-year-old Nelene Fox raised $212,000 so she could 
pay for the treatment. She died eight months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts say Health Net erred in basing its defense on the experimental 
nature of the bone-marrow transplant. Instead, they say, the HMO probably 
should have argued that given the advanced stage of her cancer, the treatment 
was simply inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 This puts HMOs in the middle of an uncomfortable debate over defining the 
limits of acceptable -- i.e., reimbursable -- treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the real world, there are a lot of independent variables for making 
coverage decisions, and sometimes they're not always based on medical 
outcomes," said Dr. William Osheroff, medical director at PacifiCare Health 
Systems, a California-based HMO that operates in six states. "Companies will 
make exceptions to plans for business reasons, and I don't think there's 
anything wrong with that." 
</P>
<P>
 HMO officials wouldn't talk specifically about the non-medical issues they 
consider when making coverage decisions in sensitive cases. But some said that 
if denial might result in a lawsuit, HMOs might weigh a host of more subtle 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, women and children generally elicit more sympathy from a jury -- 
and media attention -- than middle-aged men. So does a high-profile disease 
like breast cancer, against, say, colon cancer. A procedure also is more likely 
to be covered if the patient participates in a clinical trial, so that the 
outcome would contribute to the body of medical knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there is the notion that the squeaky wheel gets the grease. "Nobody 
can write the perfect contract," said Glenn Smith, a managing consultant at the 
benefits consulting firm Foster Higgins in San Francisco. "There are gray areas 
that are likely to be subject to interpretation and, ultimately, arbitration." 
</P>
<P>
 As health plans increasingly are called on to compete on price, "they're more 
and more going to be looking at the clinical requirements of care and whether 
that care is 'cost-effective,' a term the American public has a lot of trouble 
with," he said. For the most part, "these decisions are going to be pocketbook 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
 They also will affect growing numbers of people. Enrollment in HMOs has 
quadrupled over the last decade. By the end of the year, the figure could top 
50 million and is certain to accelerate under the national push toward managed 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 In their favor, HMOs argue that they provide greater access and rarely exclude 
people with pre-existing conditions, unlike 72% of traditional health insurance 
plans, a study by KPMG Peat Marwick consulting firm shows. HMOs offer more 
preventive care than traditional insurance, and their premiums are lower. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 85% of things that bring people into a doctor's office, HMOs provide 
perfectly adequate care. "But for that 15% of things that are tertiary in 
nature, there will be some constraints on the ability to use all technology 
willy-nilly," said Hillman of the University of Pennsylvania.

MEDICINAL CASE FOR POT IS NOT PROVEN, APPEALS COURT RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal appeals court refused Friday to force the government to allow 
medical use of marijuana by people suffering from cancer, AIDS and other 
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bush Administration's 1992 decision not to let doctors prescribe marijuana 
to ease patients' pain or nausea was supported by "substantial evidence," said 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous medical experts testified "that marijuana's medicinal value has never 
been proven in sound scientific studies," the court said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has said it was reconsidering the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Trebach of the Drug Policy Foundation, one of the groups that 
challenged the government policy, said, "The ball is in Mr. Clinton's court. He 
can look up and say, 'Enough of this foolishness.' He can do something 
compassionate." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of medical use of marijuana say there is strong evidence that it is 
effective in easing the ill effects of chemotherapy, AIDS, glaucoma and 
neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
 The government allowed some people to get permission from the Food and Drug 
Administration to use marijuana for such purposes starting in 1976. A handful 
of those people still are allowed to use marijuana, but new requests have not 
been approved.

 Detroit lawyer George Bushnell, who will become the ABA's president in August, 
couldn't help but notice his audience of about 100 lawyers included only three 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you how happy I am to see you girls," he said. "And may I say 
you're a fine looking bunch of fillies." 
</P>
<P>
 They roared with laughter at the tone-setter. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers often are representing someone else when confronted by sexist remarks 
or behavior, and cannot always respond as aggressively as they'd like. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp humor is the best antidote, advised panelist Barbara Pfeffer Billauer, a 
trial lawyer from Lido Beach, N.Y. But she warned, "Deal with it immediately. 
If you don't, it doesn't get any better." 
</P>
<P>
 You need not be a witty person to wield humor effectively in such 
circumstances, said Denver lawyer Jay Powers. The secret is keeping some mental 
flash cards at the ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Powers told about a senior partner who was referred to as "this girl" while 
presenting to clients a proposed solution to a difficult legal problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Powers' suggested flash-card response: "The difference between women and girls 
is that girls still think men are smart and know what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Too strong? Consider the courtroom war story told by New York lawyer Lynn 
Hecht Schafran, in which a judge repeatedly referred to a female attorney as 
"young lady." She responded by referring to him as "old man." 
</P>
<P>
 "I could hold you in contempt," he sputtered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judge, I'm not the one who introduced age and sex into this trial," the 
lawyer answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the female lawyer who was told by a colleague, "I wish your 
blouse was more transparent." 
</P>
<P>
 Her response: "I wish your pants were transparent. I could use a good laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 Schafran doesn't agree with those content to let retirement and death take 
care of sexism because they believe older male judges and lawyers cannot be 
expected to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gender bias is so deeply rooted in every generation that it cannot be 
eradicated without discussion and education," she said. "The idea that older 
judges and lawyers cannot change ignores the way law is practiced. The law 
demands adaptability to change from all its practitioners." 
</P>
<P>
 Bushnell, 69 and a self-described "quintessential sexist," recalled that some 
of his female contemporaries were forced to seek secretarial training after law 
school so they could obtain work. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, more than half of the nation's law school students are women. 
One-fourth of the 375,000 lawyers in the ABA are women. But sexism is "much 
more virulent," Bushnell said. 
</P>
<P>
 He offered an ultimate fallback position: "When all else fails, knee the 
bastard in the groin."

DONATIONS, VOLUNTEERS HELP CARVE OUT A GROWING SYSTEM OF BIKEWAYS IN BRITAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KARIN DAVIES, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pedaling at a leisurely pace, Ethel Jones and Beryl Murphy gossip while riding 
side by side down a tree-lined bicycle path. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can ride together, carry on a conversation and we don't have to worry 
about cars," Ethel Jones, 70, said during a rest break on the 16-mile 
Bristol-to-Bath bike path. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not an activity the government encourages. Although billions are 
spent on roads each year, Britain's expanding bikeway network is a private, 
hand-to-mouth, mostly volunteer initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bristol-Bath route, which winds through suburbia, past cow pastures and 
mown hay and along the placid River Avon, is among 250 miles of paths built by 
Sustrans, a Bristol-based charity that designs and builds motor-free, 
landscaped routes for cyclists, walkers and disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
 Sustrans -- short for Sustainable Transport -- aims to build a national cycle 
route stretching 1,000 miles from Inverness in the Scottish Highlands to Dover, 
the English Channel ferry port. There are plans to extend the Bristol-Bath 
route to London, connecting with the north-south route. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to finish the network by the turn of the century. Half of the 
route's 400 miles of cycling paths have been built, and improvements are 
nearing completion on 600 miles of forest tracks and minor roads. 
</P>
<P>
 One-third of the estimated $30-million price tag will come from local 
governments, with the rest coming from donations, according to Sustrans 
spokesman Philip Insall. The national Department of Transport has offered no 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Rails-to-Trails, a Washington-based nonprofit group, expects 
governments to pick up the tab for converting 10,000 miles of abandoned 
railways to bikeways by 1997. In less than two years, the U.S. Department of 
Transportation has spent $52 million for rail-trail projects, plus $56 million 
for bike paths, lanes and racks. Under 1991 legislation, state or local 
governments must match the federal money with at least 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 John Grimshaw, a civil engineer who became frustrated with his profession, 
founded Sustrans in 1983. The charity has since built more than half of all 
cycle routes in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this country . . . we indulge in (transportation) programs which we 
haven't fully researched. Our policies are crazily extravagant and very 
destructive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cyclists' Touring Club, Britain's oldest and biggest bicycle organization, 
says bicyclists in Britain "get a poor deal, about the worst in the European 
Community countries." 
</P>
<P>
 That may change. In an abrupt policy shift, Roads Minister Robert Key said in 
September that the government will begin to promote the bicycle as a way of 
reducing urban congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Insall said he is awaiting concrete action. "As yet not a fraction of 1% of 
the transport budget is being spent on walking and cycling," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the government has said bicycling was too dangerous to encourage, 
citing about 250 deaths and 4,500 serious injuries to bicyclists each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Riding can be perilous for the 15 million Britons who own bicycles. Many city 
streets and country roads are barely wide enough for two-way car traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 2% of journeys in Britain are made on bicycles compared to 30% in the 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that cities cannot be rebuilt to accommodate bicycles. But we have to 
make roads safer for bicyclists, and do what we can to encourage them," Insall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that 60% of all car trips are less than five miles, diverting 
short-haul travel to bikes could substantially reduce air pollution, which 
regularly exceeds World Health Organization limits in most British cities. 
</P>
<P>
 While others ponder the possibilities, Grimshaw builds.

MORE RAIN, SNOW IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Another cold front rolled into Northern California, soaking the region 
Saturday with a steady rain and bringing snow to local peaks for the second 
straight day. 
</P>
<P>
 The system, part of a storm sequence that began Wednesday, has helped bring 
seasonal rainfall totals closer to normal after an unusually dry January. 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday weekend travel to the Sierra Nevada was complicated by heavy snow and 
motorists driving to the Lake Tahoe basin along California 50 and Interstate 80 
needed chains at times to cross Echo Summit and Donner Pass. Traffic often 
slowed to a crawl. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also snow closer to home. Portions of Mt. Diablo, Mt. Hamilton, Mt. 
Tamalpias and the Santa Cruz mountains were covered by snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Atkinson of the National Weather Service said the snow level dropped to 
about 2,000 feet, creating a snowy backdrop on the highest points in the San 
Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not unusual, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do get this kind of thing a couple of times a year," Atkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Atkinson said the recent rains have helped bring San Francisco up to 75% of 
normal after the dry January. 
</P>
<P>
 He said San Francisco has received 10.8 inches of rain this season. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose has climbed to 83% of normal with a total of 9.77 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather service issued a small craft advisory for coastal waters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a little breezy along the coast and the seas are up," Atkinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Atkinson said the rain would diminish early today.

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; NOTEBOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, From Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kariya, the Mighty Ducks' first draft pick and fourth overall last June, said 
he hadn't been worried about scoring a goal here and so felt no special relief 
after getting his first Olympic goal Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a goal scorer, I'm a passer," he said."But I did feel good today. I 
had a long talk with Coach (Tom) Renney today before the game and I felt like I 
was into the game more, that I had legs." 
</P>
<P>
 Said U.S. goalie Garth Snow, Kariya's teammate at the University of Maine: 
"I'm not buying into that attitude that he's struggling. He's one of the best 
players in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ferreira, who has seen Kariya play twice this week, believes that his prize 
draft pick will return to school after the Games rather than sign with the 
Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sent one proposal to the family and they reviewed it with their adviser 
and decided not to accept it," Ferreira said. "It's really frustrating. You're 
negotiating with yourself because they can't send us a proposal (in order to 
preserve Kariya's NCAA eligibility). I've got an idea what they want, and we're 
a long way from that. We're not crying poor, but it's not right. We don't think 
he deserves what he's asking for." 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya's asking price could climb if he does well, but that price is holding 
steady for now. "I'm seeing things here he's not getting away with that he's 
used to getting away with," Ferreira said. "This is a step up from the college 
level and the NHL is yet another step....The size thing won't be a problem 
because he's so quick and clever. He'll adjust." HELENE ELLIOTT

AS USUAL, NEVADA LAS VEGAS IS TOO MUCH FOR ANTEATERS; BASKETBALL: UC IRVINE 
HANGS CLOSE TO RUNNIN' REBELS EARLY ON, BUT SUCCUMBS IN END, 80-64. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Runnin' Rebels might have been slowed to a crawl recently, losing six of 
their last seven games, including Thursday's humiliation at home against lowly 
Cal State Fullerton, but they traditionally find a home game against UC Irvine 
will cure all woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters, who had lost seven in a row in the Thomas & Mack Center by an 
average margin of 28 points, made a game of it for a while, but finally 
succumbed, 80-64, in front of 4,489. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine (6-16 and 3-11 in the Big West) led, 48-44, with 13:04 remaining, but 
the Rebels, who held a three-hour, players-only team meeting Friday after 
practice, summoned just enough emotion to even their season record at 11-11 and 
7-7 in conference. 
</P>
<P>
 UNLV, which has not had a losing season since their first year of basketball 
competition (1958), has been feeling the heat lately and it has nothing to do 
with the weather in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
 UNLV Coach Rollie Massimino, who is as popular in the Thomas & Mack Center as 
LaToya would be if she had showed up across town at the MGM Grand for the 
Jackson Family special Saturday night, got a rousing round of boos when he was 
introduced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think with all the distractions we've had lately, the guys showed some real 
character tonight," Massimino said. "We got a little shaky there when they went 
ahead, but we regained our composure and came back strong and that's a very 
good sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the game, I told them that hanging in there during tough times is part 
of being an athlete." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters know all about tough times. Coach Rod Baker, who was unhappy 
with his team's effort during Thursday night's loss at New Mexico State, said 
he thought the Anteaters played harder this time around. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, however, it was just another loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't make the plays when we had to down the stretch," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The best thing that happened to the Irvine contingent in the early going was 
when Athletic Director Dan Guerrero happened to be seated in the row that was 
randomly selected to win a free pizza. The Anteaters did not score a field goal 
in the first 7 1/2 minutes, missing their first 10 shots, and the Rebels jumped 
to a 15-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Manuel's third three-pointer of the game gave UNLV a 29-12 lead with 
6:33 remaining, but Irvine outscored the Rebels, 21-9, and trailed by only five 
(38-33) at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel, who scored 39 against Irvine in the first game between the teams, made 
five of six first-half three-pointers and had 17 points at the intermission. 
Baker had Todd Whitehead follow Manuel all over the court and the Rebel guard 
did not score in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 With their outside game shut down, the Rebels went inside to center Kebu 
Stewart, who scored 23 points and grabbed 24 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just relentless on the backboard," Baker said. "You've got to put a body 
on him every time down and he's as good at rebounding his own missed shots as 
anybody I've seen." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters' starting five -- who totaled only 18 points at New Mexico State 
-- were a combined six of 22 in the first half and finished with 42 points 
Saturday night. Whitehead led Irvine with 15 points.

NEW MEXICO STATE USES DEFENSE TO BEAT TITANS; BASKETBALL: CAL STATE FULLERTON 
SHOWS IT CAN'T HANDLE THE PRESSURE, MAKING 26 TURNOVERS IN AN 85-68 LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The New Mexico State basketball team is erratic shooting from the outside, 
inconsistent from the inside and terrible from the free-throw line, but there 
is always one constant in the Aggie attack -- good defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a tenacious, half-court trap and its trademark match-up zone, New Mexico 
State helped force 26 Cal State Fullerton turnovers en route to an 85-68 Big 
West Conference victory in front of 7,927 in the Pan American Center. 
</P>
<P>
 James Dockery, a 6-foot-8 center, had 19 points, 11 rebounds and six steals, 
and four teammates scored in double figures to help the first-place Aggies 
improve to 19-3, 11-2. New Mexico State, thanks to several fast-break 
opportunities, shot a season-high 59.6% from the field but only 56.3% from the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Vernon scored 22 points before fouling out with 2 minutes 59 seconds 
left, and Darren Little added 19 points for Fullerton (6-17, 4-11), which 
trailed from wire to wire and never seriously threatened New Mexico State 
despite trimming the deficit to five with about seven minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I'm impressed with is their defense contests every shot," Titan 
Coach Brad Holland said. "They do a great job of hustling, rotating, and you 
have to hit shots with guys coming at you." 
</P>
<P>
 You also need to do an outstanding job of handling the basketball, penetrating 
the zone, avoiding traps, making crisp passes and sound decisions. The Titans 
had some success, but too often they came up short on all counts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question New Mexico State extends your offense, hawks the ball and 
creates havoc, but I still feel we're capable enough not to have 26 turnovers," 
Holland said. "I know we can take care of the basketball, but we certainly 
didn't do that tonight, and that hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton was hoping to make this a landmark road trip. They won for the first 
time in 15 games at Nevada Las Vegas on Thursday night and had never swept the 
Rebels and Aggies on the same trip. 
</P>
<P>
 But after 10 minutes Saturday night, the only landmark the Titans appeared 
headed for was the school record of 29 turnovers, which they tied in a 77-64 
loss to New Mexico State Jan. 8. Fullerton had 12 turnovers in the first 10 
minutes -- a 48-turnover pace -- and trailed, 23-11. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies had a 10-point lead (33-23) at halftime, but the Titans made a run 
when Vernon got hot from the outside. Vernon's third three-pointer of the 
second half, with 7 minutes 6 seconds remaining, brought the Titans to five, 
57-52. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico State fans were getting restless, but Paul Jarrett hit a 
three-pointer, and two consecutive Titan turnovers led to Jarrett's two free 
throws and Rodney Walker's three-point play, as the Aggies pushed the lead to 
65-52 with 6:23 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Vernon's three-pointer with 3:56 left cut it to 67-59, but the Aggies scored 
eight consecutive points in the final two minutes to pull away to their 26th 
home victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they cut it to five, we didn't feel threatened," said Jarrett, who 
finished with 10 points. "We have quick enough personnel and play with enough 
heart that we feel we can beat anyone in the conference on defense alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it's nice to have the kind of depth that allows you to play 
pressure defense for 40 minutes. Nine Aggies played at least 10 minutes 
Saturday night, and New Mexico State always seemed to have fresh players on the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Selvie and Rodney Walker had 12 points, and Corey Rogers added 10 for 
the Aggies, who had 16 steals. Fullerton center Winston Peterson scored 16 
points on six-of-10 shooting, but the Titans couldn't get him the ball inside 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never got over the hump," Holland said. "But we were within striking 
distance."

SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION III-AA GIRLS' BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS; EL DORADO 
DOMINATES LA QUINTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There was no borrowed videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no phone call to another coach. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no scouting report at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing El Dorado Coach Gary Raya knew about La Quinta was what he read 
in the newspaper, that Linda Rodriguez was averaging 21.5 points and Rhonda 
Gondringer 18.5. 
</P>
<P>
 And with that, he told his team to concentrate on themselves, do what they did 
best, and have fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Play hard, play together and we'll be in the game," he said. "When this 
tournament's over, they're only going to remember one team -- Brea." 
</P>
<P>
 Raya's Hawks did that on Saturday, dominating host La Quinta, 57-39, and 
advancing to Wednesday's quarterfinal against Newport Harbor. A coin flip today 
will determine the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the home court is going to be a tremendous advantage in that game," 
Raya said. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't against La Quinta (19-6), which never was in sync.  
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado's Kim Korsmeier and Beau Bryant hounded Gondringer and Rodriguez 
most of the night. La Quinta's top scorers rarely got an open shot, and except 
for a 62-second span in the third quarter during which Gondringer scored six, 
neither controlled the game the way they had in Garden Grove League play. 
</P>
<P>
 Gondringer scored 13 points and had a team-high eight rebounds; Rodriguez had 
14. 
</P>
<P>
 Korsmeier also had 11 points, but the offensive star was Shanna Renken, who 
scored 26 points and had 11 rebounds for El Dorado (18-7). 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we had to come out strong," Renken said. "The papers had us 
underrated; they all thought La Quinta was better." 
</P>
<P>
 Renken made her first four field-goal attempts and had nine points before 
going to the bench with three fouls with 5:32 left in the second quarter. She 
joined Michelle de Bruijn, who picked up her third foul with 2:39 left in the 
first, on the bench. Missing their two best players, the Hawks had a 20-10 lead 
to protect. Instead, they built the lead to 29-14 at halftime, and La Quinta 
never got closer than 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Division III-AA games: 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor 55, South Pasadena 37 -- Newport Harbor (20-6) outscored 
third-seeded South Pasadena, 24-9, in the fourth quarter. Mandy Clayton led the 
Sailors with 17 points and Genevieve Evarts scored 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda 90, Fullerton 36 -- Nicole Erickson had 28 points, including three 
three-pointers, and Kiyoko Miller had 14 points to lead the top-seeded Ladycats 
(26-0). Brea faces Magnolia in the quarterfinals on Wednesday. Nadia Hoerner 
scored 15 for Fullerton (15-8). 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia 53, Moreno Valley Rancho Verde 49 -- Barbara Mathews hit five of six 
free throws in the last minute to secure the victory for Magnolia (18-9). 
Whitney Torregano had 14 points and Dorretha Bennem had 16 rebounds and eight 
points for the Sentinels.

over Villa Park in a first-round playoff game Saturday at Villa Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Rio Mesa (18-7) advanced by shutting down the Spartans' offense during a 
five-minute span early in the fourth quarter.Villa Park (21-4), which never 
led, rallied to tie the score at 28 on Michelle Jacquot's basket with about two 
minutes left in the third quarter. But the Spartans did not score another 
basket until Silvia Salgado scored with 3:53 left to play. By then, Rio Mesa 
had a 10-point lead, 43-33. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park, the Century League champion, could get no closer than eight points 
the rest of the way. Michelle Miyake led the Spartan offense with 15 points, 
including three three-point baskets. Maureen Skehan added 13 points and five 
rebounds. 
</P>

View (22-4) will play the winner of La Crescenta Crescenta Valley-Rosemead game 
in the quarterfinals. Pasadena finishes 14-12. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge 87, Trabuco Hills 40 -- Erin Stovall led Woodbridge with 19 points. 
Jamie Oenning added 18 and eight assists. Angela Burgess grabbed 17 rebounds

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Rancho Alamitos outscored the Saints, 23-14. Rodgers also had 17 rebounds.

SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION II-A GIRLS' BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS; CYPRESS CRUISES TO 
VICTORY AS EL MODENA'S STRATEGY FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As far as strategy is concerned, El Modena High girls' basketball Coach John 
Cahill is no novice. 
</P>
<P>
 So Cahill instructed his charges to encircle Cypress standout center Jessica 
Eggleston whenever she had the ball Friday night during the first round of the 
Southern Section Division II-A playoffs; the idea being to force other 
Centurions to beat El Modena. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the most sound, battle-tested plans can go awry. Especially when your 
opponent has an overwhelming edge in one important category: talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite holding Eggleston in check, El Modena was unable to stop her 
teammates, as the host Centurions won, 61-50. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vanguards limited Eggleston to 12 points -- about 18 below her 
county-leading average -- but teammates Susan Flaming and Julie Adams powered 
the Centurions. Flaming scored a game-high 21 points and Adams had 20 points 
and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "My teammates did a great job stepping up," an exhausted Eggleston said. "They 
were surrounding me every time I got the ball, so we needed everybody else to 
hit some shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cahill: "We tried to make them beat us from the outside and they did." 
</P>
<P>
 Empire League champion Cypress (24-3) will play Redondo Beach Redondo Union in 
the second round Wednesday. The Vanguards, who finished third in the Century 
League, end the season 11-11. 
</P>
<P>
 Flaming, who made five of 12 three-pointers, scored nine points to help give 
Cypress a one-point lead (16-15) entering the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Adams took over. 
</P>
<P>
 She dominated play with 11 points and eight rebounds during the quarter. Adams 
and Flaming made consecutive baskets in the closing seconds of the first half 
to give Cypress its biggest lead of the game, at 13 points, 33-20. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept looking for the open shots because they were surrounding Jessica," 
Adams said. "We knew we had to make some shots because they were all around 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Jamie Shine led the Vanguards with 12 points and six rebounds. Guard 
Jennie Foyle had 10 points and four steals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not disappointed with how we played at all," Cahill said. "They're a very 
good team and they showed that." 
</P>
<P>
 In other Division II-A games: 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon 46, Pomona Garey 41 -- Canyon (15-9) led by 10 points at the half and 
held on for the victory. Katherine Fish had 13 points and Sara Spjut had 12 
points and 14 rebounds for the Comanches, who will face Troy in a second-round 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Hacienda Heights Wilson 68, Tustin 55 -- Katie Scheuerman had three 
three-pointers and finished with a team-high 15 points and Alison Carr had 12 
points and 14 rebounds for Tustin (17-10). 
</P>
<P>
 For Hacienda Heights Wilson (22-3), the division's defending champion, Nelli 
Lew had a game-high 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy 52, Compton Dominguez 39 -- Dinah Shah had 19 points and seven assists, 
Rebecca How added 11 points and Audra Gamst scored 10 points to lead Troy 
(19-5), which will face Canyon in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia 51, La Mirada 48 -- LaQuinta Alexander had 14 points and 11 rebounds 
and Tina Katz and Michelle Prager each scored 10 for Valencia. The Tigers 
scored 20 points in the fourth quarter to come back from a six-point deficit 
after three quarters. Valencia will face Alemany in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Hills Alemany 58, Katella 39 -- Visiting Katella fell to the 
division's top-seeded team. Guard Chris Carillo led Katella (12-12) with 20 
points. Kelly McKay had 18 points for Alemany (24-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena Muir 70, Kennedy 56 -- Kennedy (16-11) failed to match last year's 
second-round performance, losing its playoff opener against Muir (17-7).

MCKAY HAS HER DAY IN ALEMANY'S RUNAWAY WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Alemany High guard Kelly McKay made quite an impression Saturday night on 
Katella Coach Joni Easterly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who?" Easterly asked. 
</P>
<P>
 McKay, she was told. Played guard. Lit your team up for 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Easterly wore a blank look. 
</P>
<P>
 McKay. Number 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought No. 22 (Samantha Rigley) and 44 (Carly Funicello) were their best 
players," Easterly said. "Is she one of their best players too?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, actually, but Easterly can be excused for not noticing McKay. The 
5-foot-8 junior is unobtrusive even when turning in the best performance on her 
team, as she did in the Indians' 58-39 victory in the opening round of the 
Division II-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was played at St. Francis High because Alemany's gym has been closed 
due to earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 While her teammates played a bit unevenly, McKay grabbed six rebounds and had 
three steals. Her 18 points ranked her just behind Funicello, who scored 20. 
And whether playing tenacious defense or hitting her smooth jump shot, she 
never changed her placid expression. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just my personality," she said. "I get into it, but I just don't show 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Alemany Coach Melissa Hearlihy: "She's such a quiet player, but she does 
big things." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing proved bigger than McKay's eight points in the second quarter, which 
helped the Indians (24-0) weather the scoring explosion of Katella guard Chris 
Carillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Carillo had 12 of her 20 points in the first four minutes of the quarter, 
drawing Katella (12-12) to within 21-17 with 4:20 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alemany, the top-seeded team in the division, went on a 8-0 run to close 
the half. 
</P>
<P>
 The night belonged to McKay. With two minutes to play and the outcome decided, 
she earned the applause of her teammates by diving to force a jump ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's worked hard all week in practice," Hearlihy said. "And it showed 
tonight."

BAUTISTA UNEXPECTEDLY WRESTLES WAY TO FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nobody expected Rio Mesa High wrestler Jesse Bautista to make an impact at the 
Southern Section individual championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly not the coaches, who didn't include Bautista in the seedings of the 
119-pound weight class, mostly because of a 22-11 record.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, Bautista is a freshman, and lacking postseason experience. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bautista was one of six wrestlers from the area to make the finals of the 
Division I tournament Saturday night at El Monte High School. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief lead in the first period, Bautista lost in the final to Channel 
League-rival Phil Nazario of Dos Pueblos, 10-4. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bautista did get the satisfaction of upsetting No. 1-seeded Lee Cabrera of 
Hesperia, 8-7, in the quarterfinals.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'd never wrestled any of these guys before," Bautista said. "I just went in 
there and did my thing and got my confidence up." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura, the only area school with two finalists, won one title. Heavyweight 
Sean Burdick defeated Jesse Wright of San Marcos, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 At 145 pounds, Tim Bonebright of Thousand Oaks was the only other area 
wrestler to win a championship, defeating Kevin Young of Hueneme, 11-4.  
</P>
<P>
 Only a bloody nose briefly slowed Bonebright (31-2) on his way to the title. 
</P>
<P>
 The other finalist from the Marmonte League, Chad Payne of Agoura, was upset 
at 125 pounds. Payne jumped out to a 7-2 lead over Miguel Valencia of Santa 
Ana, but was nearly pinned in the second period and dropped an 11-9 decision. 
The loss was Payne's second of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 At 103 pounds, Ventura senior Ryan Atherton (35-9) finished as a runner-up for 
the second consecutive year, dropping a 6-2 decision to Roger Santiago of Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura finished second in the team standings with 88 points, trailing only El 
Modena (153), which entered the tournament as the top-ranked team in the 
Division I poll.

CHASE BOUNDS AHEAD OF SUNKIST MEET FIELD; TRACK AND FIELD: QUARTZ HILL SENIOR 
TAKES BOTH TRIPLE JUMP, LONG JUMP ON FINAL TRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Either practice is over-rated or Jamaal Chase of Quartz Hill High is in for a 
superb senior season. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase, fourth in the boys' long jump and ninth in the triple jump in last 
year's state track and field championships, won both events with personal bests 
in the Sunkist Invitational at the Sports Arena on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase bounded 49 feet 3 inches in the triple jump after leaping 23-9 in the 
long jump. 
</P>
<P>
 The triple jump is the best high school mark in the nation this year and the 
long jump is fifth-best. 
</P>
<P>
 Both efforts came on the third and final attempts for Chase, who has yet to do 
any jumping or bounding drills in training. 
</P>
<P>
 "All he's been doing is strength and speed work," Coach Don Crimin said. "He 
hasn't done anything technical. No drills, no nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Chase fouled on his first two attempts in the long jump before improving his 
personal best by two inches on his final effort, one he characterized as a 
"safety jump." 
</P>
<P>
 "I took it real easy on that jump," Chase said. "I was just trying to get a 
fair jump in so I was surprised when I went that far." 
</P>
<P>
 Chase began the triple jump with a foul and improved to 46-8 in the second 
round before exploding to 49-3 on his third effort. His previous best was 48-9. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just knew that it was way out there," Chase said. "It felt good." 
</P>
<P>
 Chase was not the only performer from the region to produce a national high 
school best for the year. James Lincoln of Birmingham won the boys' high jump 
at 6-10 to defeat favored Jeremy Fischer of Camarillo, who cleared 6-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln, fifth in last year's state meet, cleared the winning height on his 
first attempt before missing three times at 7 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolores Tuimoloau of Channel Islands won the girls' shotput with a mark of 
41-7, Mike Wenz of Canyon won the boys' seeded 880-yard run in 2 minutes 0.63 
seconds and Jason Medearis of Hart finished second in the boys' 50-meter high 
hurdles in 6.86 seconds.

CSUN BLASTS SACRAMENTO JUST FOR FUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 There have been blowouts, several in fact, none of which the Cal State 
Northridge men's basketball team enjoyed more. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors, used to being on the east side of most lopsided scores, vented 
their wrath on hapless Cal State Sacramento Saturday night at the Northridge 
gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Rotating in lineups the way hockey teams change lines, Northridge powered past 
the Hornets, 90-54, before a crowd of 596 in what marked the biggest rout for 
the Matadors since the fourth game of the 1988-89 season. 
</P>
<P>
 That opponent was Bethany College, an NAIA school. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento plays in NCAA Division I, but the Hornets are a gang who can't 
shoot straight. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento made 38% of its shots, which is slightly better than its season 
average. However, Sacramento also committed 30 turnovers while making only 19 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happened to us so much during the year," Northridge center Peter Micelli 
said of the blowout. "It feels so good to turn it around on somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge's goal was not to defeat, but to bury the Hornets, a theme Micelli 
said he repeated several times during timeouts and other breaks in the action. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors certainly picked a ripe opponent. Sacramento has lost 20 in a row 
and in 48 tries has never won a road game since joining Division I in the fall 
of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 With forward Michael King and swingman Arthur Tate serving one-game 
suspensions, the Hornets suited up only seven players. Sacramento's bench was 
an odd scene: Five coaches in suits and two reserve players. 
</P>
<P>
 King, who along with Tate did not make the trip because of unspecified 
"disciplinary reasons," is Sacramento's leading rebounder and No. 2 scorer. 
</P>
<P>
 In King's place, Michael Boyd, a freshman from Gardena, stepped up to score 21 
points. Edwin Williams added 11 points and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 For Northridge (7-16), Micelli scored 17 points, with Brent Lofton, Andre 
Chevalier and Robert Hill each scoring 13. Ten Northridge players played at 
least 14 minutes and all 11 players scored. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was good to see everyone playing and having fun," Chevalier said.

NORTHRIDGE'S RECOVERY SLOWED BY FULLERTON; COLLEGE BASEBALL: MATADORS, AT HOME 
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE QUAKE, LEAVE 10 BASERUNNERS IN 1-0 LOSS TO 
THIRD-RANKED TITANS. 
</P>

<P>
 As if recovery wasn't already on the minds of the Cal State Northridge 
baseball team, Saturday's 1-0 defeat to Cal State Fullerton left the Matadors' 
thinking more of the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to get some good wins under our belts against a good team," junior 
catcher Josh Smaler said. "Once that happens, we'll take it from there." 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad, because this one could have gotten the ball rolling. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (11-1), which reached the NCAA Central II regional last season, 
entered the game ranked third nationally by Collegiate Baseball and is off to 
its best start in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors (4-4) held tough for seven innings before Adam Millan's 
run-scoring double off senior right-hander Marco Contreras (1-2) provided the 
game's only run. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaler ended an afternoon of missed opportunities by striking out with runners 
at first and second with two out in the ninth. He stormed from the batter's box 
toward the dugout and his frustrated teammates, who saw their four-game win 
streak snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frustrating," Smaler said. "I'd say that's a good word for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (4-4), playing on its home field for the first time since the Jan. 
17 earthquake that damaged much of the campus -- including the outfield wall of 
Matador Field -- stranded 10 baserunners against senior left-hander Chad 
Rolish. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolish (3-1), a converted reliever who has yet to pitch a complete game, was 
one out from going the distance before hitting Tyler Nelson and Jason Shanahan, 
both on the foot. Right-hander Ted Silva retired Smaler on five pitches to 
notch his fourth save. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had more opportunities than they did, but you've got to give their pitcher 
credit," Northridge Coach Bill Kernen said. "It's a sign of our immaturity; 
we're an inexperienced group. We've got a pretty good mountain to climb as far 
as growth." 
</P>
<P>
 While construction crews were busy making repairs just beyond the right-field 
wall, Rolish was making several recoveries within the white lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Four times he escaped with runners in scoring position, including a 
bases-loaded jam in the fourth that ended with a strikeout of Shanahan. A 
set-up man much of last season, Rolish finished with five strikeouts and four 
walks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eighth, Contreras yielded a two-out single to Jeff Ferguson. With 
Ferguson running on the next pitch, Millan delivered a line drive down the 
left-field line. Brian Vasey had trouble digging the ball out of the corner and 
Ferguson scored easily. 
</P>
<P>
 "I threw a breaking ball and he got it," said Contreras, who struck out five 
and yielded six hits while logging his third complete game. "It's tough for me 
to take right now. But they're the third-rated team in the country. I guess I 
can't be too disappointed."

BRAZEN PALMDALE BATTERS HART WITH THIRD-QUARTER SURGE; HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL: 
CONFIDENT FALCONS KNOCK OFF NO. 1-RANKED INDIANS, WHO TURN COLD IN THE SECOND 
HALF, 65-49. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Members of the Palmdale High basketball team strolled into The Master's 
College gym Saturday night with a confident, almost cocky look about them. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Falcons backed it up, beating favored Hart, 65-49, in the second round 
of the Southern Section Division I-A playoffs in front of a more than 1,100. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was played at The Master's because Hart's gym sustained severe 
earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart, the Foothill League champion and No. 1-ranked team in the Times' Valley 
poll, finishes 21-2. Palmdale, the Golden League champion and No. 3-ranked 
team, improved to 23-3 with its 15th consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the season the Falcons lost to Hart by three points in the final 
seconds. Palmdale will make its first ever appearance in the quarterfinals 
Tuesday night against Buena at a site to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kids were really up for this game," Palmdale Coach Garry Phelps said. 
"From the start of the season they've been very confident. They said, 'Coach 
we're going to go 15-0 in league,' and we did. Then, they had us beating Hart 
in the bracket." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale trailed throughout the first quarter and most of the second. The 
Falcons tied the score, 25-25, when Al Lairson hit an 18-foot jumper from the 
left baseline with 1:58 left in the half. The score remained the same at the 
break. 
</P>
<P>
 Lairson, a 6-foot-4 senior, scored 23 points, 13 in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons came out firing in the second half. They outscored Hart, 13-2, in 
the opening minutes and took a 38-27 lead when Lairson hit a short jumper. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians went scoreless during a four-minute span in the third quarter and 
their shooting didn't improve in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It comes down to something that's pretty simple: We didn't shoot the ball 
well," Hart Coach Mike May said. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale guard Jerome Payton was unstoppable in the second half. When senior 
Maurice Wright fouled out with 6:42 left in the third quarter, Payton picked up 
the slack, scoring 12 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to step up my game and help my team out," Payton said. "Then I was open 
for all those layups and I just took over." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Ballew, Ronnie Valenzuela and Cody Patterson fouled out for Hart, which 
got 12 points from Randy Roa.

SOUTHERN SECTION GIRLS' SOCCER PLAYOFFS; CAPISTRANO VALLEY OVERPOWERS SANTA 
MARGARITA IN FIRST ROUND 
</P>

<P>
 With half its front line sidelined after first-half injuries, Santa Margarita 
was easy prey for Capistrano Valley, which scored two second-half goals and 
defeated the Eagles, 2-0, in a Division I first-round girls' soccer game 
Saturday at Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley (20-4-3) will face Claremont, which knocked it out of the 
playoffs last year in the first round, in the quarterfinals Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The game began as an evenly matched showdown between the Cougars, ranked fifth 
in the county, and Santa Margarita (16-6-1), ranked seventh and coming off its 
second consecutive Sea View League championship. 
</P>
<P>
 But when freshman left winger Erin McIntyre left the game because of a 
possible concussion and leading scorer Erica Di Vitis went to the sideline 
because of a knee injury, the Eagles were without most of their offensive 
punch. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Di Vitis went down, that really hurt them," Cougar Coach Harry Hutcheson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley took a 1-0 lead five minutes into the second half, when Kim 
Thompson drove a corner kick into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars scored again 10 minutes later on a breakaway goal by freshman 
Renee Peterson, who was brought up from the junior varsity for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense tightened its grip on the Eagles the rest of the half behind 
senior Lindsay Light and freshman goalkeeper Sheila Teran, who made two 
one-handed saves late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Division I games: 
</P>
<P>
 Claremont 3, Irvine 3 (Claremont advances in penalty kicks, 1-0) -- Shannon 
Filbin, Heather Swanson and Sarah Denson each scored one goal and Missy Brigman 
recorded eight saves for Irvine (13-6-4). Claremont, the second-seeded team in 
the division, will face Capistrano Valley in the second round Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison 3, Torrance 0 -- Christine Tyler, Nicole Price and Laura Lamb each 
scored one goal to lead the host Chargers (22-4-3), who will play Mater Dei in 
the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei 3, Chino Don Lugo 0 -- Trisha Steiner scored the first goal for the 
Monarchs 17 minutes into the second half off a double assist from Chrissy 
Whalen and Apollonia Reyes. Whalen and Teresa Buechler also scored for Mater 
Dei (18-5-1).  
</P>
<P>
 Marina 2, Dana Hills 1 -- Amy Rubenstein scored with two minutes remaining in 
the game to give top-seeded Marina the first-round victory. Kristen Palmer also

10-minute overtime period and Esperanza (15-5-4) held off a late rally by the 
Spartans (13-3-6). The Aztecs face Redlands in the quarterfinals Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>

half off an assist from Heather Darin. Kennedy (17-4-1) will play the winner of 
Long Beach Poly next Thursday. Laguna Hills is 15-6-5. 
</P>
<P>

TIFT, MAY GET NEWPORT HARBOR OFF TO A GOOD START

<P>
 If Saturday's Sunkist Invitational is any indication, Newport Harbor's track 
and field teams will be forces this season. 
</P>
<P>
 It began with the meet's first event, when senior Wade Tift thoroughly 
dominated the shotput with a mark of 59 feet 1 inch. 
</P>
<P>
 Tift, who has signed a letter of intent with UCLA, posted three fair throws in 
four attempts, and any of them would have been enough to beat second-place 
finisher Jeremy Stout of Bakersfield (57-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor junior Misty May toyed with her competition in the same manner, 
winning the girls' high jump with a leap of 5-8, second best in the nation so 
far this indoor season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I would have to jump at least 5-10 to win today," said May, the 
Times Orange County girls' volleyball player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailor Tina Bowman cleared 5-6 to tie for second with defending State champion 
Tracey Lawyer of Carpinteria Cate. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill senior Ethan Taub, defending county champion and a State finalist 
last year in the 400 meters, posted the second-fastest time of the day while 
winning his heat in the 500 yards in 59.2 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Taub was beaten only by Michael Granville of Bell Gardens, who ran 57.7 to 
break the sophomore national record and equal the fifth-fastest prep 
performance ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "My leg was giving me a little trouble out there," said Taub, who broke his 
leg in the third game of the football season. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress senior Jimmy Hutsell finished fourth in the 500, running 59.5 for 
second in Granville's heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Taub also came back to lead off Foothill's mile relay, which won its heat in 
the day's fastest time, 3:27.6. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Orange County highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tustin's Reggie Curry produced one of the farthest indoor jumps in recent 
county history, covering 47-3 1/4 for fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Woodbridge senior Gary Young, defending county champion in the 100 and 200 
meters, finished third in the 50-meter dash in 5.93 seconds, behind the 
national junior record 5.69 of Moreno Valley Canyon Springs junior Bryan 
Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The El Toro girls and Newport Harbor boys won their respective two-mile 
relays. Track Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park senior Carrie Garritson found herself trailing ninth-grader Julia 
Stamps of Santa Rosa Rincon Junior High and Sarah Brandy of Ashland, Ore., in 
the girls' two-mile. Garritson's 11:06.3 was fifth-fastest in the nation this 
year but well behind Stamps (10:30.2) and Brandy (10:33.3). . . . Edison junior 
Jason Bader was fourth in the discus with a toss of 154-8 . . . Villa Park 
senior Phil Sitner was third in the rated mile in 4:29.8 . . . Capistrano 
Valley junior Adalberto Sanchez was sixth in the boys' two-mile in 9:48.2 . . . 
Katie Mook, a Foothill junior, won her heat in the 50-meter hurdles in 7.79 . . 
. Woodbridge junior Meisha Wilson-Duval was fifth in the 50-meter dash in 6.73.

 HOOP IT UP: The Anaheim Arena will be showcased nationally Monday when Long 
Beach State meets Memphis State in the first men's college basketball game at 
the facility. The 9 p.m. game, part of ESPN's "Big Monday" package, will be 
played in Anaheim because the school could not reach a suitable deal with Long 
Beach Arena. . . . "They welcomed us with open arms," says Scott Cathcart, Long 
Beach State assistant athletic director. Seats are still available.

 VETS & VETS: Veterans of the Vietnam war, both American and Vietnamese, will 
celebrate the lunar calendar's Year of the Dog at a luncheon in Buena Park 
today hosted by the local Vietnam Political Detainees Mutual Assn. . . . "This 
is the first time we have been able to invite our American counterparts to our 
celebration," says organizer Thu Dinh Duong. "They were very receptive to the 
idea." About 4,000 Vietnam veterans and family members are expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 FIRING HERE: Former New Hampshire Gov. John H. Sununu has known great 
political highs and lows. Once a power as President Bush's chief of staff, his 
love of office perks led to his downfall. Now he's back on top. . . . As the 
conservative commentator on CNN's "Crossfire," he's much in demand as a public 
speaker. But the Fullerton Republican Women Federated gets him Wednesday for 
free: Sununu is a close friend of one of the members. The group's announcement 
calls it "the first time our club has had a world-renowned and powerful 
national figure." 
</P>
<P>
 WHERE WAS DAN? Following tradition, President Clinton's picture hangs in the 
Federal Building at the Santa Ana Civic Center. But guess how it differs from 
George Bush's. Alongside Clinton's portrait hangs a picture of Vice President 
Al Gore. Bush never shared billing that way with his man Dan Quayle. . . . It's 
a Veep first, federal workers there say. But one of them quipped: "Clinton's 
not able to handle the job by himself."

 FREEWAY ALERT: After a five-week closure for earthquake repairs, the Simi 
Valley Freeway between Reseda and Sepulveda boulevards will be partially 
reopened today or Monday, Caltrans officials said. With a portion of the 
eastbound freeway destroyed, traffic will be diverted to the westbound side of 
the roadway.. . . Over the weekend, Caltrans crews were re-striping the 
westbound side of the freeway to accommodate three lanes of traffic in each 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 QUAKE HELP: In the second phase of a program to help victims of the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the 
governor's Office of Emergency Services opened two service centers Saturday in 
Santa Clarita at 28460 Ave. Stanford and in Santa Monica at 1901 S. Bundy 
Drive. . . . In addition to accepting emergency aid applications, the centers 
will assist with long-term recovery, restoration and rebuilding efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 NO SURRENDER: It takes more than an earthquake to keep a good church down. 
Every Sunday, parishioners of Mary Immaculate Catholic Church in Pacoima come 
to Mass even though their sanctuary, where a statue lies shattered, above, has 
been red-tagged and services are held in the parking lot. (B1) . . . "I've been 
in the Valley for 43 years and this has been my parish all our lives," said one 
churchgoer, who clearly is not ready to give up. 
</P>
<P>
 RIGHTS CASE: A Libertarian activist who says he was unjustly arrested as he 
was gathering signatures on a petition to legalize marijuana at the Antelope 
Valley Mall will be represented by the American Civil Liberties Union at his 
upcoming trial. (B1) 
</P>
<P>
 GANG TRUCE: Two San Fernando Valley gangs celebrated a 110-day truce by 
cheering their homeboys on in a football game at a Pacoima park. (B2) . . .The 
truce came three weeks too late to protect a 19-year-old, who watched the 
action from a wheelchair on the sidelines.

A CALMER GONZALEZ BEATS CARBAJAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Finesse, not a free-for-all. Smarts, not heart. 
</P>
<P>
 To the shock of almost everyone except Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez, the 
sequel to a slugfest began sleepily, developed subtly and was won with a 
demonstration of precision. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a frustrating style and ignoring a deep gash that opened up in the early 
rounds over his left eye, Gonzalez avoided the all-out pace of his first fight 
against Michael Carbajal, and avoided Carbajal's jolting left hook in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was Gonzalez winning by split decision, and taking two-thirds of 
the light-flyweight championship from Carbajal on Saturday night before 10,333 
at the Forum in a fight that never seemed to fall into a real rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
 There were flashes of fury and occasional blasts like the past, but for the 
most part, the rematch was a faint echo of the first raucous fight between 
Carbajal and Gonzalez, two fighters who had grown more wary, not wild, after 
almost a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Carbajal at times tried to get Gonzalez to join him in a brawl, and landed 
some heavy right hands in the process, but looked frustrated by the middle 
rounds and never jarred Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no knockdowns, in direct contrast to the first fight, in which 
Carbajal was sent to the canvas twice before knocking out Gonzalez in the 
seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to get him to fight," Carbajal said. "He's a fighter. But 
against me, it's a different story." 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Hank Elespuru of Sacramento scored it 117-113 for Gonzalez, and Ray 
Solis of Mexico scored it 115-113 for the winner. Mike Munoz from Phoenix 
scored it 115-114 for Carbajal. 
</P>
<P>
 Carbajal now is 30-1, Gonzalez 38-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously recalling the devastating knockout he suffered last March 13 at 
Carbajal's hands, Gonzalez, from Mexico, never was in serious trouble Saturday 
night, though his nimble retreats did draw some boos. 
</P>
<P>
 He slowly gained momentum starting with the fifth round and won the ninth 
through the 12th on two of the three judges' cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "My plan was to put on pressure in the later rounds," said Gonzalez, the new 
International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Council champion. It's the 
second time Gonzalez has regained the WBC crown. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was my plan from beginning to end, to start slow and build momentum. I 
kept going." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez stayed away from Carbajal's power punches through most of the first 
four rounds, and the blood streaming down his left cheek never seemed to 
quicken his pace or bother him. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fifth, Gonzalez finally began moving forward, plying Carbajal with 
sharp combinations from a left-handed stance. The first signs of a possible 
repeat of the action of the first fight came in the sixth round, with Gonzalez 
zeroing in on Carbajal and Carbajal answering with overhand rights. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eighth, Gonzalez waded in again, scoring against Carbajal's head with 
several right and left hooks. But he backed away before he could do any real 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 By the ninth, Gonzalez was scoring often, but neither fighter had hurt the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10th was a triumph of Gonzalez's strategy, as he leaned in for effective 
combinations, then pulled out of the way before Carbajal could catch him with 
any meaningful punches. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez started quickly again in the 11th, and again bounced away from close 
quarters before Carbajal could unleash. He stuck and moved through most of the 
rest of the round, then landed several heavy shots in the final minute, 
appearing to daze Carbajal at 2:55 of the round. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men were bloodied as the 12th and final round started, and Gonzalez 
opened it with another flurry that had Carbajal backpedaling. 
</P>
<P>
 As the bell rang, both men lifted their arms in celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no excuses," Carbajal said. "The judges said he won, what can I do? I 
don't agree. I believe I landed more solid punches, I pressed the fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Carbajal, who never flinched at giving Gonzalez a rematch after their first 
fight, said he expects one from Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 "He better give me the rematch," Carbajal said. "I want a rematch as soon as 
possible."

ARIZONA STOMPS ON UCLA; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: THE WILDCATS OVERWHELM BRUINS, 
98-74, TO CUT PAC-10 LEAD TO ONE GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's blue and gold with perfect hearing? It's the UCLA basketball team, 
listening to some pretty big footsteps coming up from behind. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, they were the shoes of the 15th-ranked Arizona Wildcats, who 
walked all over the Bruins, 98-74, and closed to within one game of first-place 
UCLA in the Pacific 10 Conference race. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the neck holes in those blue jerseys probably feel a little smaller. At 
least this is what Arizona Coach Lute Olson hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know now is that they have a one-game lead now and things tend to 
tighten up when you know a loss could put it in a tie," Olson said. "Yes, it 
just got a little tighter." 
</P>
<P>
 It got that way for No. 8 UCLA, 18-3 and 11-2 in the Pac-10, on a day when the 
Bruins gave up more points, more field goals and had fewer rebounds than in any 
other game this season. 
</P>
<P>
 You do that, UCLA Coach Jim Harrick said, and you can't expect to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can you say when you get beat?" Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, if you're UCLA, a good place to start is to figure out what went wrong 
with Ed O'Bannon. The Wildcats held O'Bannon to a season-low nine points, the 
first time this season O'Bannon has failed to score in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson positioned Ray Owes in front of O'Bannon, then ran another defender at 
O'Bannon as soon as he got the ball. It's not new strategy, but the Wildcats 
(21-4, 10-3) did it better than anyone else this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Owes outplayed O'Bannon with 20 points and 13 rebounds. O'Bannon made four of 
10 shots and offered only a few words of explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just played a good defensive game," he said. "Yeah, this is 
discouraging. They just outplayed us." 
</P>
<P>
 Tyus Edney picked up the offensive slack with 21 points, but the only other 
UCLA player in double figures was George Zidek with 18 in only 29 minutes 
because of foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Zidek didn't sound too happy about following up a victory against Arizona 
State with what happened Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you feel about it after you lost a game by 30 points?" he said. "It's 
going to be tough to forget about this." 
</P>
<P>
 A sellout crowd of 14,007 at McKale Center probably doesn't want to forget any 
of it, especially the part about Damon Stoudamire and Khalid Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
 Edney and Cameron Dollar had major troubles with Stoudamire, as Shon Tarver 
did with Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
 Edney, Dollar and Tarver spent the afternoon running around screens trying to 
get closer to the Wildcat guards. Most of the time they were too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves finished with 23 points and Stoudamire had 22, making four of eight 
three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 Edney said even if UCLA's defense had played better, it probably wouldn't have 
made any difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone could have beaten them today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so. UCLA certainly couldn't, not with O'Bannon slumping, Tarver shooting 
three for 11 and the Bruin defense going off the deep end. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins trailed by 10 at the half despite a 25-point flurry by Stoudamire 
and Reeves. Arizona's lead was 50-40 early in the second half when the game got 
out of hand in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona scored on 18 of its next 21 possessions and the Wildcats' lead was 
82-60 with 8:21 to go.  
</P>
<P>
 All that was left for Arizona was to figure out what catching UCLA and winning 
the Pac-10 title would mean as far as the NCAA tournament goes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think that the No. 1 seed in the West could go with that," Olson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, maybe not. The NCAA tournament committee is not bound to seed the 
Pac-10 champion No. 1 in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's chances to stay in the West or get shipped to another region probably 
weren't helped by another blowout defeat on national television -- 15 points at 
California, 16 points at Notre Dame and now 24 points at Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 That means in three national TV appearances, the Bruins lost by an average of 
18.3 points. This is not good exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrick cautioned against getting too worked up about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one will know in March," he said. "We still only have three losses. Not 
many teams in the country have that." 
</P>
<P>
 In the locker room after the game, Harrick reminded his team of one very 
important fact. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still in first place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, but by half as much as before.

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; RUSSIAN LANDS AN UPSET; MEN'S SKATING: THE 
BLAND, BUT TECHNICALLY SUPERIOR URMANOV PREVAILS. BOITANO IS SIXTH, DAVIS 
EIGHTH. 
</P>

<P>
 In a competition so superb that three figure skaters destined for the sport's 
Hall of Fame -- Viktor Petrenko, Kurt Browning and Brian Boitano -- finished 
fourth, fifth and sixth, the only man among the top seven who inspired no 
passion won the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not a particularly controversial decision except perhaps in Canada and 
France, the home countries of the silver and bronze medalists, because the new 
Winter Olympic champion, Russia's Alexei Urmanov, skated very well technically, 
so well that a majority of the judges were willing to overlook his bland 
presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada's Elvis Stojko and France's Philippe Candeloro, in contrast, brought 
virtually all of the 6,000 spectators who filled the Olympic Amphitheatre 
Saturday night to their feet, seeming to impress everyone except the prevailing 
judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps in a winter when virtually every mention of figure skating in the 
media contains the words assault and grand jury , they were not ready for 
freestyle programs skated to movie theme music from "The Bruce Lee Story" and 
"The Godfather." Stojko karate-kicked through the former, and Candeloro did 
everything but behead a horse in the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently preferred by six of the nine judges was the nonviolent approach of 
Urmanov, who gave them 4 1/2 minutes of long, clean lines and strong but 
understated jumps to music from Rossini. The other three judges split their 
first-place votes among Stojko, Candeloro and Petrenko. 
</P>
<P>
 Urmanov, 20, overcame considerable adversity to win. His father has 
disappeared, perhaps, according to his coach, to prison, while his mother lost 
her job in a munitions factory with the breakup of the Soviet Union, becoming a 
restaurant cook. Money has been so tight that Urmanov and his coach had to 
decide whether it was worth it to continue in the sport after the skater broke 
his ankle in April of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 His ankle is still not completely healed, but he is a better skater now than 
he was before because of it. In 1992, he became the first man to land a clean 
quadruple jump in the Olympics, but he was considered a one-dimensional skater. 
No longer able to rely on his athleticism after the injury, he concentrated 
more on choreography. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Wylie, who won the silver medal in 1992 and is here as a CBS commentator, 
suggested that there was more of the choreographer's heart than Urmanov's in 
the freestyle program. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Urmanov was rewarded with his first victory in a major 
international competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those he beat were the last two Olympic champions, Boitano from 1988 and 
Ukraine's Petrenko from 1992, and four-time world champion Browning. They 
eliminated themselves with uncharacteristic mistakes in Thursday night's 
technical program, and, although they recovered nicely in the freestyle 
program, which accounts for two-thirds of the final score, they could not 
assert themselves into the medal race. 
</P>
<P>
 Boitano, who interrupted his lucrative professional career and returned at age 
30 to serious competition, said he would make the same choice again today. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my discoveries was that the hunger wasn't there," he said. "But that's 
OK. It wasn't the wrong decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Disappearing was the man who beat Boitano in last month's U.S. championships, 
Scott Davis, who entered the night in fourth place, fell twice and dropped to 
eighth. It was the first time since 1976 that no U.S. man won a medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, 22, was one of the few men who did not skate well in the freestyle 
program. Urmanov, Stojko and Candeloro all landed seven triple jumps, but the 
Frenchman had the most intriguing, if perhaps a little overdone, program. 
</P>
<P>
 Going for the big finish, he planned the hardest of the triple jumps, a triple 
axel, for the end of his program and might have won if he had not over-rotated 
and fallen. After that, his gold-medal chances were sleeping with the fishes.

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; THE STREETS ARE LINED WITH SILVER; ALPINE 
SKIING: COUNTERCULTURE FAMILY DISPLAYS AMERICAN FLAG AS DAUGHTER PICABO STREAKS 
TO SECOND PLACE IN DOWNHILL, GIVING U.S. YET ANOTHER MEDAL. SEIZINGER WINS 
GOLD.

<P>
 The father, who dropped LSD with Timothy Leary, "before it was illegal," who 
named one daughter Picabo Street and another Sunny Main, who almost moved to 
Canada during the Vietnam War, who wouldn't look out of place among the 
Grateful Dead, stood starry-eyed in the finish area Saturday with an American 
flag draped over his shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 "This makes up for all the times I wasn't proud to be an American," Ron Street 
said. "Today, I say, 'God Bless America.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Picabo Street, his daughter, had won the Olympic silver medal in women's 
downhill at Kvitfjell. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine that. The hippy's little girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Street, from Sun Valley, Ida., lost out on gold only because the world's top 
woman downhill racer, Germany's Katja Seizinger, brought her best stuff to 
Norway and posted an outstanding time of 1 minute 35.93 seconds. After 
Seizinger, who skied third, everyone else was racing for second. 
</P>
<P>
 It was sweet redemption for Seizinger, 21. Despite being named the 
international Alpine skier of the year for 1993, she took a pounding in the 
German press after crashing in last week's Olympic super-G, a race she was 
favored to win. It also eased the pain of her fourth-place downhill finish at 
the Albertville Olympics two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Street, at 1:36.59, and Italian bronze medalist Isolde Kostner, at 1:36.85, 
were the only other racers faster than 1:37. 
</P>
<P>
 With Street's performance, U.S. skiers have earned two golds and two silvers, 
and need only one more Alpine medal in the next eight days to match their most 
successful Olympics, the 1984 Games in Sarajevo, when skiers had three golds 
and two silvers. 
</P>
<P>
 Street's success was somewhat of a surprise. She hasn't won a world circuit 
event in her two years on the tour. Her best finish was second in a combined 
event at last year's world championships in Japan. But her practice times here 
were excellent, including the day's best time in the final downhill run Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she almost got into trouble during the race. Street shot through the 
first half of the run without a hitch but ran so fast into the tricky section 
called "the corkscrew" near the bottom that she got ahead of herself in the 
gates and barely salvaged a jump. 
</P>
<P>
 "She really shanked it at the bottom," said Paul Major, the U.S. women's 
coach. "She almost came to a stop at the end of that one jump. If she hadn't 
had that, she'd have been in there fighting for the gold." 
</P>
<P>
 After the race, Picabo's freckle-faced grin was brighter than the snow. Three 
years after the U.S. ski team suspended her for insubordination, she had 
effectively proven wrong everyone who "thought I was a dirt bag." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Street's family, well, their moon was in the seventh house. 
</P>
<P>
 Picabo's mother, Dee -- who raised two children, chickens and rabbits and 
cooked 18 years on a wood stove in the Street's small two-bedroom home -- held 
court near the finish area and took on the waves of reporters who wanted to 
know, real quick, "How'd Picabo get her name again?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dee, a folk singer and Joan Baez devotee, fielded questions with aplomb, 
explaining that Picabo, a small town in Idaho, was an Nez Perce Indian word 
meaning "shining waters," though later was changed to Silver Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 Even better: Silver Creek wins silver. Baba, Picabo's older brother, removed 
his sunglasses at the race finish to show reporters a scar near his right eye 
that was caused when Picabo hurled a cup at him in anger when they were kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was over chores, who had to vacuum," Baba said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baba's given named is Roland Wayne Street III, but father really wanted to 
name him Juan Way Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Stubby, 54, recounted his reckless youth: how he failed in his first 
marriage; how he used to hang out at Berkeley with the acid-king, Leary, and 
how he got in on the ground floor of the "psychedelic revolution." 
</P>
<P>
 Reporter: "So, you dropped acid?" 
</P>
<P>
 Stubby: "I thought everyone did. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a pothead.But I've never liked alcohol, tobacco and firearms. I've always 
been down on those." 
</P>
<P>
 The Streets certainly put a new twist on the classic American success story. 
Yet, theirs is a tale of inspiration and devotion. Dee and Stubby, who moved to 
Triumph, Ida., from Reno, in the late '60s, have been married 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
 They never left their children with baby sitters. Together, the family cooked 
and cleaned and traveled. Had it not been for laws, the children would have 
been schooled at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Though precocious and headstrong, Picabo comes from common stock. She is not 
the spoiled-brat offspring of rich ski academy parents. Her father is a stone 
mason. 
</P>
<P>
 The Streets gave their children room to stretch, to succeed and fail on their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'd let us walk into things where they know we would hit the brick wall," 
Picabo said. "Then they'd pick us up, brush us off and say, 'On your way.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Picabo once insisted on celebrating her parents' wedding anniversary, so her 
parents allowed her to drink herself sick on champagne, to the point, Picabo 
said, "that I never wanted to drink again." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, within the loose framework of 1960s attitudes, there was moral base. The 
Streets were well mannered and did their chores. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was 'please' and 'thank you,' " Picabo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there were many Picabo potholes on the road to success. Her temper and 
competitiveness were fierce. Picabo was the red-haired, red-faced terror of 
Triumph, a two-horse-hitch town ruled by Baba and his renegades. 
</P>
<P>
 Picabo says she learned how to win by competing against the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's what makes me as tough as I am," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Picabo followed Baba everywhere, into and out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once, she threw a stick at me with a nail in it, and it hit me in the back," 
Baba said. "I turned around to chase her and she was gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, though, family came first. 
</P>
<P>
 When Street was shipped home from the U.S. ski team's summer camp in 1990, it 
greatly disappointed her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, she joined them in Hawaii, where her dad was working on a 
construction project. Under his watchful eye, Picabo rededicated herself to 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father set me straight," she said. "I was wandering astray." 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, it all ended wrapped in an Olympic bow in Norway.  
</P>
<P>
 The Streets did not always think ahead, but the path to the Olympic podium was 
well rooted. 
</P>
<P>
 At 10, Picabo, already a top-notch ski racer, told her father she was going to 
win an Olympic medal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We caught eyes," she said of the moment, "and he realized I was serious." 
</P>
<P>
 Picabo said a lot of things, but no one dared dash her dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a friend gave Stubby an American flag to hold in Olympic escrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'I'll give it to you as long as you display it if she ever gets 
there,' " Stubby said. 
</P>
<P>
 The flag had been on display for years in the Streets' living room. Saturday, 
it was displayed on Stubby's back. He guessed there was more than one right way 
to raise an Olympian. And a family.

JIM MURRAY: LOW SCORES PROVIDE LOW POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some years ago, when the Palm Springs Open was new on the tour and staged for 
the first time at Thunderbird, the great Ben Hogan was in the field. At the end 
of a round, he looked up at the leader board. A golfer named Bo Wininger had 
shot a 61. So had a pro named Chandler Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben studied it in distaste, then turned to a reporter and gritted his teeth. 
"What in the world," he wondered, "am I doing on a golf course where guys shoot 
61s?!" 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't golf. It was a pool table with flags in it. A bowling alley with 
sand traps. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogan wanted a course where the fairways were so narrow you had to proceed 
down them single file. Where there were trees on the right, water on the left 
(preferably the Pacific Ocean), and greens so slick you could skate on them and 
if you marked your ball, the marker slid. Hogan wanted courses named "The Blue 
Monster," or "The Hall of Horrors," or "Three-Putt Acres." If a course was 
named "Hogan's Alley," you knew you'd never break 100 on it. 
</P>
<P>
 You wonder what Hogan would think of the 35th annual Bob Hope Chrysler Classic 
down here this week, which has evolved out of that tournament Hogan quit 
playing in long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 At the close of business here Saturday night, one guy had shot 61, two guys 
had shot 62s and another had shot a 63. Four had shot 64s and eight guys shot 
65s. Almost everybody had shot 66s. You had to shoot five under to make the 
cut. Two guys made holes in one. Hogan would need smelling salts. 
</P>
<P>
 These courses are defenseless. They are like Paris surrounded by Germans. 
London in the blitz. You get a mental picture of them as a fighter on the ropes 
with his legs rubbery, his mouthpiece falling out, his eye cut, his nose 
bleeding and the crowd shouting "Stop it!" 
</P>
<P>
 You wonder why they don't make these guys play left-handed or blindfolded to 
even things up a little bit. Make the holes smaller, the tees muddy. Make them 
putt on one leg. Outlaw drivers called the Big Bertha or Boom Boom or Killer 
Whale. Don't just outlaw square grooves, outlaw any grooves. Make the club face 
as slippery as a spatula. Make them play in leather heels. No cleats. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a very long week for guys like me, who are big fans of double bogeys 
and out-of-bounds bounces and for whom the happiest sound in the world is the 
splash of a ball in the water by a guy who is two under par. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's no relief in sight. The assault continues. The courses are being 
reduced to rubble. The bogey is obsolete. Matter of fact, so is par. A guy 
makes par, he throws his club. You and I make par, we throw our hat in the air 
and the ball into the gallery. These guys curse and kick the ball-washer. Par 
won't even get you the honors on the next tee. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Crenshaw restored our faith in the game a little bit. In all this miasma 
of birdies, eagles, 61s, 62s, Ben weighed in with a -- are you ready for this? 
-- 13 on a hole Friday. Now that -- God bless him! -- is an octuple bogey! I've 
made lots of them. Arnold Palmer once made a 12 at Rancho Park and, later, when 
asked what happened, responded "I missed a short putt for an 11." Well, Ben 
two-putted for a 13. 
</P>
<P>
 It's nice to know there's a hole in the desert you can make 13 on. Usually, it 
takes five holes here to run up 13. 
</P>
<P>
 It's kind of cheering. The course is not the canvasback it appears. You 
picture it like Rocky, getting off the canvas and fighting back, landing 
haymakers of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogan was right. The courses are pushovers for the registered Who's-Hes? of 
the game. But they won't take any nonsense from the Who's-Whos. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Kite won this thing last year with an otherworldly 35 under par. This year 
he managed two under and is out of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the leader board is as anonymous as a motel registry. These guys 
are all phantoms of this opera. They should play in masks. For example, one of 
the leaders is named Stankowski. You should win a car if you know his first 
name or can pick him out of a crowd. He has never won a tournament, but he shot 
67-66-69-68 here. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, this was the No-Name Open. But even then, you felt order 
would be restored. The old lions of the tour would come in here and eventually 
say to the upstarts, "Very nice, fellows, but you really don't belong here." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Hoch is not your basic Raymond Floyd-Lee Trevino-Tom Watson-Hale Irwin 
contemporary but he's been out of qualifying school for over a decade and he 
doesn't wear an earring or tap into the latest in rap albums or even wear a 
goatee. He's about as Establishment as you have in this field, and he gave the 
kids a lesson in keeping the wheels on Friday and Saturday after his flashy 
second-round 62. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoch knows a patsy golf course when he sets foot on it and he treated Bermuda 
Dunes with the disrespect it deserved Saturday, when, on the 18th hole, he hit 
his second shot with a driver. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, ordinarily, you hit a driver only when the ball has a wooden peg under 
it. You're not going to hit fairway drivers on Open courses, but Hoch blistered 
his second shot to the back of the green on the par-five 18th so that a birdie 
was not only easy but inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoch's second 66 of the tournament left him four shots ahead after Saturday's 
fourth round. Now, a four-shot lead going into a final round in most 
tournaments would mean an automatic trophy for most players -- especially 
veterans who know how to smuggle a four-shot lead into the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 But a four-shot lead in this tournament is like being tied in most others. 
There are still 62s lurking out there. This tournament is like wild-card poker 
-- not even a full house or four of a kind is safe. Twenty-four under is 
leading. But shaking the ribbon clerks out of this high-limit deuces-wild game 
is not as easy as it is in a British Open. It's hard to play golf looking over 
your shoulder. On these courses, you have to look over both shoulders. Pebble 
Beach, it ain't. 
</P>
<P>
 It's still no place for Hogan. Bob Hope Scores

GROWING INTO ROLE; VANDERBILT'S 6-10 HEIDI GILLINGHAM IS COMFORTABLE BEING THE 
TALLEST PLAYER IN WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's a frosty February morning on the Vanderbilt University campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Leafless American elms, sugar maples, poplars and Shumard oaks stand like 
frozen sentinels amid century-old brick buildings.  
</P>
<P>
 Heidi Gillingham strides along a walkway, on her way to a psychology class. 
Her brown hair, scarf and long coat trail along behind her.  
</P>
<P>
 Her smooth, long stride eats up concrete like no other woman can in college 
athletics, because Heidi Gillingham is unlike any other woman in college 
athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 She is 6 feet 10.  
</P>
<P>
 That's in her basketball shoes.  
</P>
<P>
 In four-inch high heels, she quips, she's "no more than 7 feet." 
</P>
<P>
 She says her true height is just over 6-8. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Vanderbilt women's Coach Jim Foster saw her standing next to a 
height scale, a piece of wall tape marked in inches up to 7 feet.  
</P>
<P>
 "Hold it, Heidi -- stand up straight," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Foster looked closely. He was right. In basketball shoes, she was 6-10. He 
asked if the school could list her as such, and she consented. Big-time 
psychological advantage, Foster explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Fine, Gillingham must have thought at the time, I'm due for a psychological 
advantage.  
</P>
<P>
 This remarkable athlete -- who plays with style and grace, runs the court with 
a rare smoothness and artfully blocks shots at a rate few in her sport have 
matched -- is only now able to look down upon other earthlings . . . and be 
happy with her view of the world.  
</P>
<P>
 After all, she said, being 6-10 at 22 is a cakewalk compared with being 6-4 at 
14. Heidi Gillingham could write a book about what that's like.  
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of tears, growing up," she said. "I used to look at myself 
in the mirror and cry. I'd say: 'God, why are you doing this? What is going 
on?' " 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Now, Gillingham is an All-American, almost certainly headed for a pro 
basketball career in Europe. She's the tallest player in women's college 
basketball, its best shot-blocker and certainly a star in Nashville, where the 
Vanderbilt women's team is riding high.  
</P>
<P>
 Her stage is antiquated Memorial Gymnasium, a 1952 concrete-block structure 
that seats 15,300, where the Vanderbilt women's team averages about 5,000 a 
game, compared with the men's average crowd of about 14,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillingham's team is 18-6 this season and was 30-3 in 1992-93, when the 
Commodores reached the women's final four.  
</P>
<P>
 In the low post, she has a smooth turnaround jump shot, with a high release. 
In a recent 84-82 loss to Tennessee before 12,645 at Nashville, 645, another 
prominent post player, Tennessee's 6-6 Vonda Ward, never came close to blocking 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillingham, in early foul trouble, had a so-so game, playing only 24 minutes 
and scoring 14 points with one rebound.  
</P>
<P>
 But even on an off night, her athleticism is apparent. When her teammates 
shoot free throws, she plays back, like a free safety. With her quickness and 
great reach, few dare to break for the basket.  
</P>
<P>
 On offense, she's often knocked around by players who are shorter, fronting 
her and employing a low center of gravity to back her up, sometimes to directly 
under the basket, while contesting passes to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's supposed to be against the rules," Foster said.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Gillingham is a big woman from a little farm town. 
</P>
<P>
 Home is still a 75-acre farm in Poth, Tex., about 30 miles southeast of San 
Antonio.  
</P>
<P>
 Her mother, Janet, is 5-8. Her father, Kent, who died in a small-plane crash 
last September, was 6-6. Her little sister, Gwen, is a 6-7 sophomore who plays 
for North Carolina. An older sister, Heather, is 6 feet and works in the 
fashion industry in New York. And older brother Greg, who played football at 
Rice, is 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Gillingham remembers Heidi standing before the mirror a decade ago, 
crying. 
</P>
<P>
 "She does enjoy being tall now, but back then, when she was 6-4 as a 
14-year-old . . . well, it was difficult for her.  
</P>
<P>
 "Her father would tell her: 'Don't worry, you know you won't be taller than 
me.' But she did become taller than Kent, of course.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of it was tied to the fact that some day she'd want to look for a 
husband, and would any man be interested? That was involved in it. Now, she 
knows God has someone for her someplace, when she needs that person."  
</P>
<P>
 Heidi hopes so.  
</P>
<P>
 "When my sister (6-7 Gwen) was being recruited by Vanderbilt, I was a 
sophomore here," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "When she made her visit to Vanderbilt, I told her: 'Look, you're going to 
have to go someplace else. There just aren't enough tall men here to go 
around.'  
</P>
<P>
 "I was dating a 6-8 guy here when I was a freshman, but he transferred to Penn 
State . . . but not because of me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Socially, being this tall isn't that great. It's been so long since I've had 
a real date. "I have a lot of short-guy friends, but that's different. Overall, 
I feel my height is a (positive) attribute. My friends accept me and that's 
important to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Time grows short when you're a 6-10 woman, said Gillingham, who is majoring in 
psychology and has a 3.2 grade-point average.  
</P>
<P>
 "It really impacts on my school time," she added.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of media demands on my time. If I was a 5-8 basketball 
player, there wouldn't be half the interviews, because I'm not that great (as a 
player). It's because I'm tall, and there's some sensationalism to a lot of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm on Earth to serve God, so if my time is divided up a lot, I just deal 
with the interruptions." 
</P>
<P>
 Extra-tall boys were in short supply at Poth High, too. Once, the Gillingham 
sisters decided to make a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one asked us to go to the prom one year, so we decided to go together," 
she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing. We had a ball. We showed people 
that night it was fun to be tall." 
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't always been that way, of course.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was very hard for Heidi when she was a young teen-ager, and all her 
friends and cousins began going out on dates and no one asked her out," Janet 
Gillingham said.  
</P>
<P>
 In a space of 13 months, starting when Heidi was 13, she grew from 6 feet to 
6-4, her mother said.  
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Gillingham was elected homecoming queen at Vanderbilt.  
</P>
<P>
 "I hesitated before filling out the nominating form," she said. "I decided it 
would enable me to make a statement to the whole country . . . that it's OK to 
be different. I knew there would be a lot of media there, so I did it.  
</P>
<P>
 "I loved it, the whole experience. Luckily, my sister (Heather) in New York 
had ordered a nice outfit for me without even knowing about homecoming. It was 
a long crushed black velvet palazzo pants outfit with a vest.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think, when I was on the stadium field that day, everything came together 
for me.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I was out there, I remembered being a skinny, 12-year-old, looking in 
the mirror . . . So you learn to live and learn. Great height evokes strength 
and independence, I decided. "And for a woman to be this tall -- it's really a 
challenge, every day. No one can understand what it's like to be this tall.  
</P>
<P>
 "The result is, I've become a strong person. Strength comes from being 
tested." 
</P>
<P>
 She was asked if she'd ever met a taller woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met Anne Donovan (a 6-8 former U.S. Olympian) once, but I'd probably inch 
her out," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Strength and independence. That's pretty much what Vanderbilt women's 
basketball has acquired since Gillingham arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 In her senior year, she narrowed her choices to Vanderbilt, Rice, Stanford, 
Duke and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 The year Gillingham arrived, Vanderbilt drew an average of about 1,400 for 
women's games. Now, it's up by more than 3,600. Last season, the 
Vanderbilt-Tennessee game drew 15,317.  
</P>
<P>
 What comes next? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to go to graduate school," she said. "I'd like to be a counselor in 
a Christian environment some day, maybe with a ministry." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't look for her in Atlanta in 1996.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really not interested in the Olympics," she said. "Most of my experiences 
with USA Basketball haven't been happy ones. The only one I really liked was 
Pete Newell's big player's camp (where women must be at least 6-4 to be 
invited). 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never mentally prepared for those training camps -- they're very 
physical. I guess my college season takes a lot out of me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to try playing pro ball in Europe, though. That appeals to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Foster said Gillingham has perfectionist leanings, which put her in deep funks 
when she doesn't play well.  
</P>
<P>
 "She really gets down on herself, and I keep telling her she shouldn't equate 
basketball with perfectionism," her coach said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I point out to her that the Hall of Fame is filled with players who missed 
half their shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gillingham: "I understand what Coach is saying, but I don't know if 
there's a way to correct that problem." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been times, she said, when she considered quitting basketball.  
</P>
<P>
 "In my sophomore year, I felt like I was playing only because of my height," 
she said. "I kept wondering what else I could be doing if I wasn't this tall." 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Williamson, Vanderbilt's sports information director for women's 
basketball, has a favorite Gillingham perfectionism story.  
</P>
<P>
 "I showed her a story an out-of-town writer had done on her, after an 
interview here with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She started wincing and acting upset when she read it. She was really upset. 
When I asked her what was wrong, she said: 'I used the wrong tense for a verb!' 
" Ten Tall Reasons 
</P>
<P>
 For a recent feature, the Nashville Tennessean newspaper asked 6-10 Heidi 
Gillingham to write a Dave Letterman-style top-10 list of reasons why it's 
great to be a really tall woman.  
</P>
<P>
 Her list:  
</P>
<P>
 10. It doesn't matter if my barrette doesn't match.  
</P>
<P>
 9. I save money shopping for clothes and shoes. Nothing fits! 
</P>
<P>
 8. I can store stuff on top of cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
 7. I never need a shower cap.  
</P>
<P>
 6. I can swat flies on the ceiling...with my hand.  
</P>
<P>
 5. I don't need stirrups to mount a horse.  
</P>
<P>
 4. When trapped in packed elevators, I can breathe the only fresh air left.  
</P>
<P>
 3. I don't have to climb sycamore trees at parades.  
</P>
<P>
 2. I have great access to airborne bridal bouquets.  
</P>
<P>
 1. 'Cause that's just how God made me!

CLIPPERS GO AS QUIETLY AS HARPER; PRO BASKETBALL: GUARD RETURNS WITH 30 POINTS, 
BUT KEEPS COMMENTS TO ONE CONSTANT 'WHATEVER' AFTER 100-93 LOSS TO JAZZ. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Clipper guard Ron Harper let his game do the talking against the Utah Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper returned after a one-game suspension which cost him $48,780.49 for 
making derogatory comments about the Clippers, and had 30 points and 10 
rebounds in a 100-93 loss to the Jazz Saturday night before a sellout crowd of 
19,911 at the Delta Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, who was disciplined after an outburst in which he compared playing for 
the Clippers to being imprisoned, had a one word answer for nearly every 
question: whatever.  
</P>
<P>
 After the game, someone put a sign on Harper's stall in the locker room that 
read: "Whatever" -- Ron Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how an exchange went with Harper before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How are you? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What did you do yesterday? 
</P>
<P>
 A: None of your business. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did you watch the (Clipper's 97-91 loss to Atlanta) game last night? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, I watched Shaquille. He was awesome. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you feel about them suspending you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have you decided whether you'll file a grievance? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Whatever. (He later indicated that he probably would file a grievance). 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is this going to affect how you speak now? Are you going to hold your 
tongue? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is that your favorite word now? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't any more talkative after the game. Harper didn't take up much space 
on the quote sheet that the Jazz distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Harper: (Question 1) "Whatever . . . . " (Question 2) "Whatever . . . . 
(Question 3) "Whatever."  
</P>
<P>
 Even teammate Danny Manning got into the act? 
</P>
<P>
 Told that Harper didn't seem talkative, Manning said: "Whatever." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Harper did carry on a conversation with All-Star forward Karl Malone 
of the Jazz during the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone kidded Harper about his jail quotes as Harper prepared to shoot a free 
throw. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harper said he felt like he was in jail and I was just (asking) him, 'What's 
going on with that jail sentence out there in L.A.?' " Malone said. "He didn't 
say nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, who had sat out two of the last three games due to disciplinary 
measures, started fast, scoring 14 points in the first quarter. He wound up 
making 11 of 22 shots and eight of 14 free throws in 44 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning had 16 points, six rebounds and seven assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper was the only guard who played well as the Clippers (17-32) loss to the 
Jazz (33-19) for the second time in four days. Clipper guards Mark Jackson, 
Gary Grant and Randy Woods combined to make only seven of 20 shots as the 
Clippers lost their third game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jazz, who overcame a 15-point third-quarter deficit to beat the Clippers, 
103-99, on John Stockton's three-pointer with 5.2 seconds left Wednesday night 
at the Sports Arena, had an easy time in the rematch, building a 16-point 
third-quarter lead en route to their ninth home win in a row over the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 A fan circulated a petition before Friday night's game against the Atlanta 
Hawks at the Sports Arena calling for Clipper Coach Bob Weiss to resign. "Tell 
them I can't afford to resign," Weiss quipped . . . . Clipper forward Tom 
Tolbert sat out the second half with a sore back. Forward Loy Vaught, who had 
10 points and 13 rebounds, is averaging 11.2 rebounds in his last four games 
since returning to the starting lineup in Tuesday night.

KINGS ARE LOSING THE RACE; HOCKEY: THEY FALL SEVEN POINTS BEHIND FINAL PLAYOFF 
SPOT AFTER 4-3 LOSS TO SHARKS. THE GO-AHEAD GOAL COMES WITH 0.4 SECONDS LEFT IN 
SECOND PERIOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 OK, so Marty McSorley wasn't the instant solution. Anybody got a better idea? 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings are running out of ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 And time. 
</P>
<P>
 And their confidence isn't exactly in large supply either after they dropped a 
4-3 decision to the San Jose Sharks Saturday night before a sellout crowd of 
17,190 at San Jose Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a crucial showdown against a team that has been in existence only three 
years and the Kings couldn't pull out a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 They had a chance. Just before the final second ticked off, defenseman Darryl 
Sydor took one last shot from the left circle, but it was stopped by goaltender 
Arturs Irbe, stretched out in a prone position, as the green light came on, 
signaling the end for the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss drops them seven points behind the Sharks, holders of the eighth and 
final playoff spot in the Western Conference, with 26 games to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings are 21-31-6, San Jose 22-26-11. 
</P>
<P>
 It was hoped that the trade that brought McSorley to the Kings last week would 
provide the spark to turn things around. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Kings find themselves 0-2 in the McSorley II era and losers of 
four in a row overall. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no easy answers," King Coach Barry Melrose said, "no gimmicks, no 
trick plays, no magic answer." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the biggest game in the brief history of the Sharks, who haven't 
previously been this high in the standings this late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming into a sold-out hostile arena with so much on the line, the Kings 
needed to score first and fast to deflate the mood. 
</P>
<P>
 And score they did 2:18 into the game on a shorthanded goal after Pat Conacher 
stole the puck and fed Mike Donnelly on a breakaway. 
</P>
<P>
 Donnelly skated down the slot and smashed the puck over Irbe's left shoulder 
for Donnelly's 16th goal. 
</P>
<P>
 But as was the case 24 hours earlier, the Kings soon lost the lead and the 
momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night against the Philadelphia Flyers, the Kings scored 27 seconds into 
the game, only to end up losing, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night, the Sharks tied the score just under two minutes after 
Donnelly's goal. Wayne Gretzky turned the puck over around his own blue line, 
Igor Larionov feeding fellow Russian Sergei Makarov, who scored his 18th goal 
on a breakaway, backhanding the puck past goalie Kelly Hrudey. 
</P>
<P>
 Luc Robitaille got his-team high 32nd goal when Sydor's shot caromed into the 
net off Robitaille's leg. But the Sharks' Jamie Baker evened the score, 2-2, 
with his sixth goal before the period was over. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose defenseman Jayson More scored his first goal of the season in the 
second period, but that was countered by a classic Gretzky-to-Jari Kurri 
two-on-one rush, the kind they have been pulling off since they both called 
Edmonton home. Kurri put this one in shorthanded for his 26th goal, tying the 
score with only 20 seconds remaining in the period. 
</P>
<P>
 That proved to be four-tenths of a second too much. 
</P>
<P>
 With only that fraction of time remaining on the clock, the Sharks, still on 
the power play, found wing Johan Garpenlov all along in the right circle. 
Garpenlov buried his 13th goal between Hrudey's pads and it was 4-3 San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Kings hold on for four-tenths of a second, the game probably goes into 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, it has been that kind of a season. And it's only getting later, not 
better. 
</P>
<P>

 King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Nicolas Vachon, son of King executive and former goaltender Rogie Vachon, is 
leading the minor league Knoxville Broncos in scoring in his first season of 
professional hockey. Vachon has 72 points in 50 games, including 25 goals, 
along with 117 penalty minutes. . . . The Kings didn't waste much time giving 
away Tomas Sandstrom's number. Defenseman Jim Paek now wears No. 7.

MEMORY WILL DRIVE EARNHARDT IN QUEST TO WIN DAYTONA 500; AUTO RACING: HE WILL 
BE THINKING OF BONNETT AS HE GOES FOR THE ONE MAJOR TITLE THAT HAS ELUDED HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Even some of Dale Earnhardt's rival drivers believe it's about time for him to 
take the checkered flag for the Daytona 500 in his black No. 3 Chevrolet 
Lumina. 
</P>
<P>
 He will start on the outside of the front row, alongside rookie Loy Allen Jr., 
in today's race at Daytona International Speedway's 2 1/2-mile tri-oval. 
</P>
<P>
 Four times in the last five years, Earnhardt has led with 10 or fewer laps 
remaining -- twice he was ahead with one lap to go -- yet he is still looking 
for his first victory in the Super Bowl of stock car racing. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, he led 155 of the 200 laps and had the field covered as he took the 
white flag for one final lap, only to have a punctured tire slow him enough to 
allow Derrike Cope to sweep past on the fourth turn for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, he led 107 laps, including 19 of the final 20. The one he failed to 
lead was the last. Dale Jarrett led that one to the finish. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a different Dale (Earnhardt) this year," Jarrett said. "He and (car 
owner) Richard Childress were hit very hard by Neil's (Bonnett) death, and 
their team will be running with a lot of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dale has said that Neil will be driving with him. I wouldn't be surprised at 
all if this is the year Dale does it. He has a special reason." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnett, one of Earnhardt's closest friends, was killed on Feb. 11 while 
practicing for the Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoff Bodine, an upstate New Yorker who has never had a friendly relationship 
with Earnhardt, a modern good ol' boy from North Carolina, agrees with Jarrett. 
</P>
<P>
 "Earnhardt and (Ernie) Irvan look like the favorites," said Bodine, a former 
500 winner, "but it seems like one of those cars has never won here and this 
may be his time. Eventually, he's bound to have some good luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvan won the 1991 Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt, a six-time Winston Cup champion and last year's series winner, has 
displayed a seldom-seen soft side in conversations with the media and fellow 
drivers. He admits to being deeply touched by Bonnett's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be very emotional Sunday," he said. "It's already been an 
emotional time for us, and everybody knows why. Neil Bonnett was definitely 
with us (in Thursday's Twin 125 race won by Earnhardt) and he'll be with us 
Sunday. I'm going to try to win the Daytona 500 for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt is one of racing's most aggressive and determined drivers, but 
remains somewhat fatalistic over losing one Daytona 500 after another. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had so many close seconds or failures, and when we've had the 
opportunity to win, something happens, we're in the middle of everything," he 
said. "We come down here and try to win every year. If we don't win it before 
our career is over, we're not going to worry." 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt already has two victories at Daytona this week -- in one of 
Thursday's Twin 125 heats and in Friday's International Race of Champions, 
bringing to 22 the number of races he has won here -- but the 500 has eluded 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, a rookie driver from Raleigh. N.C., earned the pole with a lap of 
190.158 m.p.h. But he was using Hoosier tires for qualifying and will be on 
Goodyears in today's race. He and all other Hoosier contract drivers made the 
switch after their tires did not prove race-worthy in the Twin 125s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never had any problems with our Hoosier tires, but when everyone else made 
the decision to go with Goodyears, we went, too," Allen said. "One reason for 
our decision was that other drivers said they wouldn't draft with me if I 
stayed on Hoosiers." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, a former World Karting Assn. champion who has driven in only five 
Winston Cup races and never finished better than 26th, said his ambition today 
was "to stay in the lead draft and finish better than 26th." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Martin, one of the strong force of Ford drivers, was not pleased with the 
tire situation. "I'm glad the Hoosiers are gone," he said. "The only thing is 
that it's very unfair that they were faster (in qualifying), and so some people 
had to go home that wouldn't have had to if they were all on the same tire." 
</P>
<P>
 Rusty Wallace, whose 10 victories were the most on the Winston Cup circuit 
last year, predicted a four-car race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to include myself in there, the way our new Ford has been testing," 
Wallace said. "I think the 3, the 6, the 28 and the 2 are definitely going to 
be the cars." 
</P>
<P>
 That would be, in order, Earnhardt, Martin, Irvan and Wallace, who drove a 
Pontiac last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "All are beatable," Wallace added. "We can beat each other, but those four 
should be the ones in front when we come down to the finish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Running second (in a Twin 125) was the icing on the cake because it wasn't 
our best engine. We'll have our strongest engine for the 500. It's one we had 
for qualifying. Then we sent it back to the Penske Racing South shop in North 
Carolina, where the guys freshened it up. They re-honed the cylinders, put in 
new pistons, valves, springs, all that sort of thing, and sent it back here for 
the race." 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are six former 500 winners in the field, Irvan is the only one 
among the favorites. His 1991 victory came when Earnhardt crashed with Davey 
Allison two laps from the finish while chasing Irvan. 
</P>
<P>
 The other former winners in today's race are Bill Elliott, 1985 and 1987; 
Cope, 1990; Darrell Waltrip, 1989; Bodine, 1986, and Jarrett, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarrett, who had a disappointing qualifying time followed by a first-turn 
accident in his 125-mile heat, will start 41st, in the last row, through a 
provisional position based on last year's owner standings. 
</P>
<P>
 A wild card in the picture may be Jeff Gordon, the 22-year-old from Pittsboro, 
Ind., who stunned his elders by bulling his way to the finish line ahead of 
Earnhardt and Irvan in last Sunday's Busch Clash. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon finished fifth last year as a rookie and will start in the third row, 
alongside Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt's assessment: "Gordon is getting better and better, and he's going 
to be a car to contend with. We're going to have to race him just like he's one 
of the five or six cars who can win."

 Motor Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 After sitting back in third or fourth position as the lead pack neared the end 
of the Goody's 300 Busch Grand National race Saturday, Dale Earnhardt made one 
of his patented moves around first Ernie Irvan and then Terry Labonte to win 
his fifth straight Goody's race. 
</P>
<P>
 He averaged 144.135 m.p.h. in his Goodwrench Chevrolet and won $50,933. In the 
last lap shuffle, Dale Jarrett was second. Today's Daytona 500

 There are closest-to-the-hole contests, and then there is the 
closest-to-the-hole contest that will be held Oct. 9 on the 145-yard eighth 
hole at the Bob 'O Link golf course in Lawrenceburg, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner will win it all -- 18 holes, swimming pool, kitchen, pro shop. 
Everything. Amateurs and pros have until Sept. 1 to submit an entry for $2,000 
apiece that will earn them a chance to win the 6,430-yard, par-71 course owned 
by Jack Ridge. The winner also has an option of taking $1 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition is limited to the first 3,000 entries, which would be worth $6 
million to Ridge. The minimum number is 850, which would bring in $1.7 million.

 Trivia time: How many managers have managed their sons in the major leagues? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Hungry for the ball: For basketball fans with an appetite for offense, it did 
not get any better than Dec. 13, 1983, when the Detroit Pistons defeated the 
Denver Nuggets, 186-184, in triple overtime, the highest-scoring game in NBA 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiki Vandeweghe led the Nuggets with 51 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was worn out," Vandeweghe told Sport magazine. "I just went home 
that night and crawled into bed. I didn't have anything to eat." 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit's Kelly Tripucka, on the other hand, couldn't wait to chow down after 
scoring 35 points in the 3-hour 11-minute game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was strange, but eating was what I thought about most during the game," 
Tripucka said. "I was wondering if there was going to be any place open when we 
were done." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cleared for takeoff: Basketball players aren't the only athletes who find 
their minds wandering during competition. Ask Bob Samuelson of the U.S. men's 
volleyball team, which had an 18-38 record last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think, in the middle of a game, we should be worrying about getting a 
bulkhead seat on the flight home," Samuelson told Volleyball magazine. 
"Unfortunately, that was the situation in a lot of our matches." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Wheels of fortune: If you failed to qualify to drive in today's Daytona 500, 
but still have the urge to put the pedal to the metal, you might want to play a 
new board game called "Super Speedway Strategies." 
</P>
<P>
 The game is endorsed by none other than the the King himself, seven-time 
Daytona winner Richard Petty. The player who completes the most laps wins the 
race. The player who earns the most dollars wins the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, they're not dollars. It's Petty Cash.

 Where's the valet? Michael Jordan knows he will have to make some adjustments 
in his swing if he hopes to make the Chicago White Sox. On Saturday, Jordan 
discovered he will have to make some changes in his parking habits, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan watched a home run by Glenn DiSarcina sail over his head in right 
field, then peered through the fence to make sure the ball did not hit his red 
Corvette. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan could use some horsepower in his swing. He has yet to hit a ball over 
the fence since his practice sessions began Tuesday.

ANGEL QUEST IS TO BE BEST IN THE WEST; BASEBALL: REALIGNMENT AND A YEAR OF 
SEASONING FOR THE KIDS OFFER HOPE FOR HUNGRY PITCHER LANGSTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sinew in his neck stretched taut, Whitey Herzog scowled at pitcher Mark 
Langston and bellowed the question heard 'round the Angels' world. 
</P>
<P>
 "What more do you want from us?" Herzog asked in exasperation. "Just how much 
money do you need?" 
</P>
<P>
 Langston glared at him and, surprising even himself, raised his voice and 
snapped back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you what I want," Langston said, pointing at the flashy ring on 
Herzog's finger. "I want one of those. I want what you have. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want a World Series ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want you to give us a chance to win a World Series." 
</P>
<P>
 Langston's point was painfully blunt, yet ever so eloquent. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months since that negotiating session in the Angels' offices, Herzog is 
gone as general manager and Langston is back. He can still walk away as a free 
agent at the end of the season, but said this week that he's willing to commit 
his next four years to the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, he wants a simple commitment that the Angels will be aggressive in 
their quest to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've made that crystal-clear to the Angels," Langston, 33, said, "and they 
realize that. I can't emphasize how much I want to win. And I feel good that 
will happen now because we finally got somebody (General Manager Bill Bavasi) 
in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I didn't want to be here, I wouldn't be, because I've certainly been given 
all the chances to leave. But this is where I want to be, and this is where I'd 
like to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Langston, yet to reach an agreement on a contract extension, will arrive today 
for the start of spring training with faith that the Angels will fulfill their 
promise. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe he's fooling himself, or perhaps the Angels have fooled him, but 
Langston is convinced that they have just as much chance of winning the 
American League West title as anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it might sound a bit crazy. This is a team that has finished a 
combined 84 games out of first place since Langston's arrival four years ago, 
and in the last two seasons, the Angels have finished 42 games under .500. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when the Major League Players Assn. approved realignment in January, 
the outlook of the Angel organization changed. With Chicago, Minnesota and 
Kansas City headed to the American League Central, and only four teams left in 
the West, the Angels figured they might have a chance at winning their 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 They immediately acquired outfielders Bo Jackson and Dwight Smith, each of 
whom hit more homer runs in reserve roles last season than all but three 
Angels. They picked up relievers Craig Lefferts, Bob Patterson and Bill Sampen, 
and they signed starters Frank Tanana and John Dopson, both from 1993 playoff 
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The realignment makes us instantly competitive," said Langston, who has been 
selected to the American League All-Star team the last three years. "The teams 
that are left aren't powerhouse teams. I really think we can win this whole 
ball of wax." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are in a division with the Seattle Mariners, Texas Rangers and 
Oakland Athletics. The Mariners and Rangers have never won a division title, 
and Oakland finished last in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you'll see a different team this spring, one with a whole lot more 
confidence," Angel Manager Buck Rodgers said. "We had so many first-year kids 
last spring, I think guys were just happy to be here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, it's a whole different game. It's going to be like the Olympics. If you 
don't want to win, don't bother to show up." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have already sold out their box seats for the spring and expect to 
have near-sellouts for every game. 
</P>
<P>
 The main attraction is Jackson, who may also relieve some of the pressure on 
other players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, I felt I was under a microscope," said first baseman J.T. Snow, 
who was acquired in the Jim Abbott trade, "but it won't be that way this 
spring. If anything, the spotlight is going to be on Bo and Tim (Salmon). I'll 
be able to go into spring without feeling like everyone's checking me out." 
</P>
<P>
 There still will be plenty of questions, but much of the uncertainty is gone. 
Despite the possibility that shortstop Gary DiSarcina will be the most 
experienced starting position player -- having been in the majors all of 2 1/2 
years -- the veteran pitching staff realizes that these kids belong in the big 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, they had no idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were just too many question marks last spring," Langston said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took a lot of marquee players off the team and gave doubts to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, we all knew that Tim Salmon had great years in the minor leagues, but 
there's a slew of players who have had great minor league careers and never 
made it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, after watching Tim and what everyone else did last year, and 
seeing some of the things we did this winter, I'm very, very encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I've got a funny feeling this could be our year." Angels' Spring

 Getting mushy: It wasn't exactly divine intervention, but some unearthly

race  
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, 60, envisions a race that would boost the popularity of mushing 
nationally and aid winter tourism in the upper Great Lakes region. 
</P>

 "It woke me up in the middle of the night,' Campbell said. "It's a natural. We 
could make this the sled-dog capital of the United States."

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; WHAT ABOUT BOBSLED WASN'T FAST ENOUGH?; 
TWO-MAN: U.S. TEAMS ARE 12TH AND 14TH AFTER TWO RUNS DESPITE HAVING NO MAJOR 
PROBLEMS. SWISS ARE 1-2.

 Monaco's Prince Albert is 32nd. Jamaica's Dudley Stokes of "Cool Runnings" 
fame is 24th. 
</P>
<P>
 Armenia is 37th, Bosnia-Herzegovina 35th, Trinidad 38th and American Samoa 
42nd. 
</P>
<P>
 Heck, U.S. drivers Brian Shimer and Jim Herberich were leading two-thirds of 
the 43-team field after Saturday's first two heats of two-man bobsled in the 
Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the third of the field they trail that represents the realistically 
insurmountable problem in today's final two heats. 
</P>
<P>
 No Puerto Rico I or Virgin Islands I and II in that group. 
</P>
<P>
 Reto Goetschi, driver of Switzerland II, emerged from the first two heats with 
a lead of one-10th of a second over his more renowned countryman, Gustav Weder, 
the defending Olympic champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunther Huber of Italy, the 1993-94 World Cup champion, was third, .27 behind 
Goetschi. 
</P>
<P>
 Shimer and Herberich were 12th and 14th respectively, more than a second off 
the lead and reduced now to a goal of finishing in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither blamed the Bo-Dyn sleds for the disappointing runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sled was running great, as it has all season," said Herberich, who had 
been among the training-run leaders but was 15th after a 53.04 first heat in 
which he and brakeman Chip Minton hit the wall hard coming out of the infamous 
13th turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about pressure in his Olympic debut, the Harvard engineering graduate 
said he had slept and eaten well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I didn't have enough jitters," Herberich said. "Maybe I was so relaxed 
I wasn't focused enough. I made some bad mistakes in the first heat. I thought 
I cleaned it up in the second, but the time wasn't there. We've come a long way 
this year, but I'm obviously disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Shimer, of USA II: "The sled was running better. I'm pleased with that. 
Coming in, I was worried we wouldn't even be in the top 15, but we discovered a 
broken mounting yesterday and the team worked like crazy to get it fixed." 
</P>
<P>
 There was another positive for the Shimer-Randy Jones team. The push didn't 
come to shove, as some had feared. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest little controversy for the U.S. sledders, Shimer had tried to 
dump his pusher and brakeman of the last two years in favor of Jeff Woodard of 
Randy Will's team. 
</P>
<P>
 Will was eliminated in a Wednesday race-off with Shimer and Herberich for the 
two U.S. berths in two-man. Shimer, dissatisfied with his start times all 
season, enlisted Woodard as his pusher for the second of two training runs on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 His start time improved significantly, and Woodard was registered by the U.S. 
Bobsled Federation as his brakeman, only for the federation to realize that its 
selection procedures gave Jones the right to veto a change at that point. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones confirmed Saturday that he had exercised that veto, although he also 
said no one had ever told him he wasn't competing, an interesting contradiction 
that didn't jibe with the insistence by a federation official that he had been 
told. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why else would he exercise the veto?" the official said, adding that to take 
Woodard back out of the sled, the federation had to cite his strained 
quadriceps muscle, a legitimate but not sidelining injury, as evidenced by the 
Shimer-Woodard start time of Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here to slide, that's my job," Jones said of the veto, insisting there 
were no hard feelings and no controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it was Brian's idea or the coach's idea," he said of the 
change. "That's not my job. Brian is the quarterback. He's going to do what 
he's going to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, once into the sled, I'm just along for the ride. As for Thursday, I 
was only going to take one run anyway, so I got rest and he got to experiment a 
little. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing has changed. We're friends, teammates. Have been and will continue to 
be." 
</P>
<P>
 Shimer endorsed the positive spin. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some misconception, miscommunication," he insisted. "I was only 
looking at some variables (on Thursday). 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to see if it was my driving, the sled or Randy. Obviously it was the 
(broken mounting on the) sled. I mean, Randy got me this far and we've closed 
the gap on the start times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still not happy with them, but I'm not happy with myself. I'm not in top 
shape (because of a hamstring strain). I can give a good effort, but I'm not 
100%." 
</P>
<P>
 The Shimer-Jones start times Saturday were 5.08 and 5.09, compared to 5.04 and 
5.01 for Goetschi and his pusher, Guido Acklin, whose brother, Donat, pushes 
for Weder. Each tick adds up. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't make up on the bottom of the hill what you lose at the top," said 
Shimer, the 1992-93 World Cup champion. "No sled and no driver can."

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; SWEDEN PUTS U.S. BACKS AGAINST WALL AS RALLY 
FAILS; HOCKEY: AFTER A 6-4 DEFEAT, THE AMERICANS NEED AT LEAST A TIE AGAINST 
ITALY ON MONDAY IN ORDER TO MAKE THE MEDAL ROUND. 
</P>

 Mike Dunham saw it all through closed eyes, saw himself skating to the bench 
to be replaced by an extra skater and rejoicing when his teammates tied their 
game against Sweden and clinched a berth in the Olympic tournament's medal 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 If not for Hakan Loob's ricochet goal with 59 seconds to play, the U.S. 
goaltender would have been pulled and his vision might have come true. Unable 
to bear the real sight of Loob and Sweden celebrating the final goal of their 
6-4 victory Saturday, Dunham retreated into his imagination, pressing his face 
and body into the ice for nearly a minute before rising wearily to his feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just frustrating," Dunham said. "We showed them how we could play, but 
we ran out of time. We had them on the ropes." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it's the Americans who are reeling and need a tie or a victory Monday 
against Italy to earn the fourth Group B playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite twice pulling within a goal in the third period, they were unable to 
repeat the game-tying rallies they staged against France, Slovakia and Canada 
and fell to 0-1-3. Italy (1-3-0), seeded eighth here, has never made the medal 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't played a full 60 minutes in the four games we've played," said 
wing John Lilley, who gave the six-seeded U.S. team a short-lived lead Saturday 
when he tucked a shot behind Tommy Salo's left arm at 10:32 of the first 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to play a full 60 minutes against Italy and after that. If we play 
our game the way we can, use our speed and play with emotion, we can win. If we 
don't, who knows what's going to happen?" 
</P>
<P>
 What will happen is a replay of Saturday's roller-coaster ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lilley's goal should have boosted the team's confidence, the 
emotional spark flickered and died within minutes. With no one to rekindle it, 
Sweden, 3-0-1 and one of three undefeated teams remaining in the tournament, 
scored four consecutive goals. The first three came from right wing Patrik 
Juhlin, a 1989 Philadelphia Flyer draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave them a little too much respect. They're a great team and we kind of 
laid off and were playing a little passive," left wing Brian Rolston said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't do that. We played with them in the third period and had them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emotion's got to be there. I think other teams are more talented than us, 
but if we play with that American emotion, we can play with them." 
</P>
<P>
 They played nearly evenly with Sweden only because team captain Peter 
Laviolette gave them an emotional boost with a locker-room speech during the 
second intermission.  
</P>
<P>
 Laviolette, who rejoined the Olympic program to avenge his disappointment over 
a seventh-place finish in 1988, told his teammates that while the game might be 
lost, they could keep their self-respect by playing the final 20 minutes with 
some life. 
</P>
<P>
 They almost salvaged both the game and their pride. Peter Ferraro's breakaway 
at 3:25 and Rolston's spin-around at 5:29 cut Sweden's lead to 4-3, but Roger 
Johansson's power-play shot rebuilt a two-goal difference at 9:25. The United 
States had an answer for that, too, on a wrist shot by Rolston from the right 
circle at 10:51. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peter told us, 'I don't care if we lose, 10-1, as long as we show some 
heart,' " Dunham said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we felt more relaxed after that." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Juhlin: "We thought after two periods that the match was over. We backed 
off too much and they scored two goals and showed a lot of heart." 
</P>
<P>
 But not enough heart. "I thought our play in the third period was the kind of 
emotionally charged play my team has to play," said U.S. Coach Tim Taylor, a 
stoic type not given to yelling encouragement behind the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "(After the game) we were talking about playing with that kind of emotional 
charge from the minute the first puck is dropped until the 60th minute." 
</P>
<P>
 Laviolette was on the ice in the 60th minute Saturday, watching helplessly as 
Loob picked up a puck Todd Marchant had tried to bang off the boards and 
flicked it off Dunham and into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're talking about a roomful of 20-year-olds. You've got to give everybody 
credit for playing with a lot of heart and desire," said Laviolette, the team's 
elder statesman at 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to come out from the beginning and do that next time. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a group, we have to remember what we did in the third period. For us right 
now, the tournament starts (Monday). 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't do it, then we didn't play well enough to get where we want to 
go."

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; BOSTON'S DELFINO IS HOPING TO GIVE ITALY A 
CHANCE

 Everyone back on Elm Street in Medford, Mass., will be watching closely Monday 
if favorite son David Delfino starts in goal for the Italian Olympic hockey 
team against the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 Delfino, who left the Boston suburbs six years ago to play in Italy, hopes it 
won't become a nightmare on Elm Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "Goaltending is a beautiful position if you win, and it's very tough when 
things don't go your way," said Delfino, who has seen many pucks come his way 
-- and get past him -- in four games with the Italians, who upset France for 
their first victory Saturday, 7-3. "I just want us to compete well and come in 
fourth (in their group). It would be great to play against the Americans, and 
to play well." 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from the University of Lowell in Massachusetts in 1988, 
Delfino passed up a tryout with the Vancouver Canucks to play in Fassa, Italy. 
He spent four years there before being sold to a team in Alleghe, a mountain 
town. "Italy has treated me very well. It has great food and great people." 
</P>
<P>
 Delfino is eligible to play for Italy because his paternal grandfather was 
born in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Delfino started in Italy's 6-3 loss to the U.S. at Albertville in 1992, a 
nerve-racking experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough for me because we drew them in the summer and I had six, seven 
months to think about the game," he said. "We played pretty well for two 
periods, but the Americans ran over us in the third. This time, I'll be happy 
as long as Italy shows some class on the ice. We're not in the same league as 
the Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 At 28, he still has time -- and the desire -- to catch on with a professional 
team in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably have some teams looking at me now, but it's hard to show you're a 
top goaltender when you're playing against the best teams in the world," he 
said. "I'd love to get a shot at playing at home, but if I don't make it, I can 
take that. I can just go to work."

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; NORWAY IS SIMPLY GOLDEN; SKIING: LUNDBERG 
AND DAEHLIE WIN NORDIC EVENTS TO PUSH COUNTRY'S LEADING GOLD-MEDAL TOTAL TO 
SEVEN. 
</P>

<P>
 If you're a Norwegian sports nut, it doesn't get much better than this. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly had Norwegian Fred Borre Lundberg won the Nordic combined event 
Saturday at the Olympics when countryman Bjorn Daehlie strode to his second 
gold medal in three days -- third medal of these Games and seventh of his 
career -- in the men's 15-kilometer cross-country skiing pursuit race. 
</P>
<P>
 Their victories gave Norway seven gold medals, more than any other country, 
and a total of 12 medals, two fewer than leading Russia. Best of all, the day's 
triumphs were achieved in Nordic events, which mean more in this country than 
speedskating, Alpine skiing, even World Cup soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 And in each case, enthusiastic crowds of 50,000 or more -- estimates ranged as 
high as 100,000 for the pursuit race -- were on hand, lining the course and 
turning the Birkebeineren ski stadium into a rippling sea of red, white and 
blue Norwegian flags. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing, unbelievable," said Daehlie, who waved and blew kisses as he 
neared the finish line, then executed a 360-degree turn on his skis just before 
crossing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was going to be crazy when I was out on the course, warming up, 
before the race. There were so many people." 
</P>
<P>
 Too many, according to American John Aalberg, a native Norwegian who only days 
ago was saying how great it was that so many people were turning out for 
cross-country races. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was crowded all the way around the loop," Aalberg said. "People were 
killing each other. I couldn't even look up at the people because I was afraid 
I would run into somebody or they might hit me." 
</P>
<P>
 In the pursuit race, a freestyle event, the winner of Thursday's 10k classical 
starts first, the rest of the skiers starting as far behind as they finished 
the earlier race. So, Daehlie started with an 18-second advantage over Vladimir 
Smirnov of Kazakhstan and 22 seconds ahead of Italy's Marco Albarello. 
</P>
<P>
 Albarello faded back to 10th -- another Italian, Silvio Fauner, won the bronze 
-- but Smirnov skied a strong race and cut into Daehlie's lead, if only 
briefly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was afraid all the time because I was going extra hard in the beginning," 
Daehlie said. "I was very tired in the uphills and worried about Smirnov." 
</P>
<P>
 Daehlie kept pushing, though, and Smirnov fell off in his challenge about 
midway through the race, settling again for second. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half of the Nordic combined, another 15k freestyle ski race, 
Lundberg, who had put himself into the lead Friday with two excellent jumps off 
the normal ski jumping hill, assured himself of the overall victory by running 
away from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying a a Norwegian flag a fan had handed him as he approached the finish 
line, Lundberg, who had started 23 seconds ahead, coasted across the finish 
line with a 1 minute 17.5-second victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "My (plan) was to open fast and scare the racers . . . behind me," Lundberg 
said. "I think it was a success."  
</P>
<P>
 Japan's Takanori Kono won the silver but another Norwegian, Bjarte Engen Vik, 
was third, eight-tenths of a second behind Kono. Kono had started fourth after 
the jump, 50 seconds behind Lundberg. Vik had started third, 43 seconds behind 
the leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Lodwick, 17, of Steamboat Springs, Colo., who had surprised by jumping to 
fifth place Friday, fell to 13th in the cross-country race, 5:13 behind 
Lundberg. He had started 1:40 behind. MIKE KUPPER

BUILDING A SHRINE FOR WILLIAMS, SPLINTER BY SPLENDID SPLINTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED GOODALL, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ted Williams didn't realize that opening up to the public could be so much 
fun. 
</P>
<P>
 It has provided a lesson in the value of friendship and allowed some of the 
people closest to him to demonstrate how much they care about the 75-year-old 
Hall of Famer, who cherishes his privacy as much as anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 When the doors to the Ted Williams Retrospective Museum and Library later this 
month in this tiny community in north-central Florida, the last man to bat .400 
for an entire season will welcome the spotlight he usually shuns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't pray much, but I'm thankful I'm still breathing every morning. I feel 
it's a hell of an asset and I'll take that for the day," said Williams, who 
suffered a stroke in 1991 and has, in recent months, been coping with the death 
of a longtime female companion. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of this has emphasized to me how important friends are, how lucky I am to 
have so damn many of them," he added, gesturing to some of the soon-to-be 
filled display cases in the 5,200-foot building that will house memorabilia, 
photographs and other items paying tribute to his life in and out of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "This makes you realize some things as you go along, that you're pretty 
fortunate and pretty lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the exhibits for the museum, which opened last week, were donated by 
ex-major leaguers and other friends of the six-time American League batting 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurricane Donna destroyed Williams' home in the Florida Keys in 1960 -- the 
year he retired from the Boston Red Sox -- and many of the items he collected 
from a career that spanned 19 seasons were lost in the storm. 
</P>
<P>
 One wing of the museum is dedicated to his military service. Another 
recognizes his achievements as an outdoorsman, including life-sized replicas of 
the some of the prize catches from fishing expeditions to places like New 
Zealand and Peru. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Williams originally rejected the idea of building a museum in his 
honor, he later consented to be a part of it on one condition: that friends 
organizing the project didn't bother him with every detail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't very enthusiastic about it at all, but I kept hearing about it and 
there was a lot of enthusiasm to do it," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally, my consent was like this: 'OK. If you want to do it, do it. But, 
don't bother me with it.' That's been my feeling because I don't want to be 
worried about every picture or every bat or anything that's going to be put in 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for the museum to become more than just a tribute to Williams. 
Organizers say a Hitters' Hall of Fame will be added next year and could 
eventually include an 80-seat theater where visitors will be able to watch 
movies and other video presentations. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams already has selected the initial class of 20 inductees for the 
Hitters' Hall of Fame. And, the museum plans to add new members -- and possibly 
stir debate among baseball enthusiasts -- each year after 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "For anybody to come out and say, 'Here are the 20 greatest hitters,' -- 
that's a hard assignment, even for somebody who's played it, lived it, breathed 
it and was born into it," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we've researched the whole thing. We have narrowed it down to where we 
feel we have 20 hitters that we can live with, and we can argue every way 
logically why this guy maybe was a shade better than that guy." 
</P>
<P>
 An intensely private person, Williams rarely makes public appearances. He 
spends about six months of the year living in Citrus County, near the museum, 
and also has a summer lodge near New Brunswick, Canada, where he likes to fish 
on the Miramichi River. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he doesn't like the crowds he attracts and tries his best to avoid the 
spotlight when he ventures away from home, close friend Lewis Watkins believes 
Williams is probably misunderstood by most people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard horror stories and had people tell me stories. But I'll tell you, 
there's not a bad bone in his body," said Watkins, director of the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an introvert. Ted basically does not like new people, does not like to 
have people up on him. He's withdrawn, but every time somebody becomes a good 
friend or he thinks they're becoming a good friend, they want something." 
</P>
<P>
 The museum, Watkins said, is a way for Williams to open up without totally 
giving up his privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know that there could be many museums built for other Hall of Famers. 
You've got to have the following," Watkins said.

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; HARDING STRUGGLES BADLY WITH ANKLE SPRAIN; 
WOMEN'S SKATING: THE U.S. CHAMPION LEAVES ICE IN TEARS DURING PRACTICE, BUT IS 
NOT EXPECTED TO WITHDRAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Discouraged by a sore right ankle, figure skater Tonya Harding left the ice at 
the Olympic Amphitheatre in tears during the middle of her practice Saturday 
and had to be coaxed to return. 
</P>
<P>
 Although U.S. Figure Skating Assn. officials said it is doubtful that the 
sprain will force her to withdraw from the Winter Olympic women's competition 
that begins Wednesday, they plan to monitor her condition in practices today 
and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 They have until Monday afternoon to replace Harding with alternate Michelle 
Kwan, 13, of Torrance, who is training near Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
 After a disappointing practice the day before, Harding seemed better initially 
Saturday. But when she failed to land every jump in the first half of a 
run-through of her four-minute freestyle program, she complained about her 
ankle to her coach, Diane Rawlinson, and her choreographer, Erika Bakacas. 
</P>
<P>
 "They keep telling me it's getting better, and it doesn't," she said. "I 
skated worse today than yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 When Bakacas suggested that the problem was in Harding's head, she said, "No, 
it's not in my head. I have the mind-set." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding quit in frustration shortly afterward, only to be retrieved by USFSA 
team leader Gale Tanger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she gets down on herself," Tanger said. "It was a hard day for her 
today. I didn't want her leaving the ice thinking she can't get it back 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 When Harding returned, she performed several spins before attempting two more 
jumps, which she landed with difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
 According to USFSA officials, Harding has received ultrasound treatments on 
the ankle since October. They said she reported no pain when she won the 
national championship last month, but they learned last week that she again was 
having problems during practices in her home rink in Portland, Ore. She iced 
the ankle during much of the flight to Norway last Wednesday. Rawlinson said 
she doubts the injury is serious. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in her head," she said. "She is feeling a lot of pressure. She is 
feeling very insecure about being here and having everyone see her as the 
villain." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if Harding will compete, Rawlinson said, "She'd better." 
</P>
<P>
 Kwan's coach, Frank Carroll, said he will be disturbed if Harding skates in 
Wednesday's technical program and then withdraws from Friday's freestyle 
program because of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no problems with her skating here," he said. "That's a decision of the 
Olympic committee and the USFSA. That's fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if she does the technical and doesn't do the freestyle because of this 
injury, it will kill me because she will have taken a chance away from 
Michelle."

NOTEBOOK; VICTORY OVER CANADA GIVES NO. 12 SLOVAKIA A CONFIDENCE BOOST

 With each game, the Slovakian hockey team experiences a new thrill. 
</P>
<P>
 Again making mockery of its 12th-place seeding, Slovakia on Saturday rode its 
rugged defensive play and the goaltending of Eduard Hartmann to an emotional 
3-1 victory over Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Stastny set the clinching goal in motion for Slovakia (2-0-2) when he 
intercepted a pass in the Slovakian zone and got the puck to Jergus Baca, who 
passed to Jozef Dano for a short-handed, empty-net goal with 11 seconds to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Canada is considered the paradise of hockey," Stastny said. "It produces the 
best hockey teams in the world, so when you play them there is always a little 
inferiority (complex). That inspires you to produce and perform better and get 
the maximum from your potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Slovakia to beat Canada for the first time in the Olympics, that will go 
in history and stay there."  
</P>
<P>
 Canada (2-1-1) took the lead 66 seconds into the game when Paul Kariya 
backhanded a shot over Hartmann. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal was Kariya's first in the Olympics, after three assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've hear people say he's been pressing, but he shouldn't," said Pierre 
Gauthier, the Ducks' assistant general manager and an interested spectator 
Saturday with GM Jack Ferreira. "What he does here won't change what we think 
of him. I'm sure he's pressing because he's a young kid in his first Olympics, 
but we really love the kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Slovakia rebounded on goals by Dano off a breakaway at 17:13 of the first 
period, and a power-play goal from the blue line by Robert Svehla at 3:27 of 
the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would call them a dark horse, but they're better than a dark horse," 
Canadian Coach Tom Renney said. "Just continue to watch that team. They're a 
good hockey club." 
</P>
<P>

 Mike Eruzione, captain of the gold medal-winning 1980 U.S. Olympic team and 
now a CBS analyst, thinks the U.S. team is in good shape despite its need to 
tie or win against Italy on Monday to make the medal round. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shouldn't be a problem. I still think this is a good U.S. hockey team, and 
I wouldn't want to play them in the first round if I were Finland," he said. "I 
think the two best teams are Sweden and Slovakia, but the U.S. played very well 
against Sweden (Saturday) night." HELENE ELLIOTT

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; DATELINE / LILLEHAMMER; THEY HERD IT IS A 
PROBLEM WHEN THE MOOSE RUN LOOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Among the first things a visitor notices when heading into the Norwegian 
countryside are the roadside moose-crossing signs. 
</P>
<P>
 The triangular, red-edged white signs with the moose silhouette are 
everywhere. That's because in southern Norway, moose are abundant. There is 
even a moose-crossing pin, a popular item among traders. 
</P>
<P>
 They call them elk here, but moose they look like and moose they are. The 
largest wild animal in the country, moose have trekked the lowlands east of 
Oslo and north through Lillehammer for centuries. This winter, because of the 
deep snow, they are having a difficult time. Instead of following their usual 
routes, many are taking the path of least resistance, wandering placidly along 
plowed roadways and railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 And because of that, and increased rail traffic to accommodate Olympic 
travelers, according to Arild Vollan of NBS Norwegian State Railways, moose 
have been dying in alarming numbers. More than 300 have been killed throughout 
Norway this winter. That means lots of cars and some train engines are 
considerably the worse for wear as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The railroad has been working on the problem, though, and has arrived at some 
solutions. One of them is wolf urine. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides humans, the moose has only one natural enemy, the wolf. Wolves are 
scarce in Norway these days, but the moose don't know that and so the railroad 
has hung sachets of chemically produced essence of wolf urine on lines along 
moose trails near the tracks. The moose smell the wolf urine and return to the 
forest. 
</P>
<P>
 The railroad also has plowed old logging roads and strewn moose food -- cut 
saplings, bales of hay and eight tons of pine needles, a moose delicacy -- 
along them, far from the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a helicopter patrol keeps track of meandering moose and warns train 
engineers to slow when the big animals are near the tracks. Just the other day, 
the 'copter spotted 70 within 500 yards of the tracks. The helicopter also 
carries a long line and a net -- for instant moose relocation when necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 And, says the railroad's Ingri Garberg, the save-the-moose measures are 
working. Since the start of the Games, only three have been killed. MIKE KUPPER

 International Olympic Committee member Anita DeFrantz of Los Angeles was a 
central figure in one of the most heart-tugging medal ceremonies of this or any 
other Olympics, presenting the gold to speedskater Dan Jansen Friday for his 
victory in the 1,000 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 Having presented a gold medal to speedskater Bonnie Blair after she won the 
500 meters two years ago in Albertville, France, and figuring that Blair would 
also win here, DeFrantz requested to the IOC before the Games began that she be 
allowed to do the honors again after that race. 
</P>
<P>
 But South Korean IOC member Kim Un Young also requested that race, figuring 
that his compatriot, Yoo Sun Hee, would win. Because he is an IOC vice 
resident, his request was given priority. 
</P>
<P>
 DeFrantz was given a consolation, the men's 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't help but think about the wrestler, Jeff Blatnick, in the 1984 
Summer Olympics, who won the gold medal and said, 'I'm one lucky dude,' " 
DeFrantz said. "Well, I'm one lucky dude." 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, IOC member Kim is no speedskating expert. His pick, Yoo, finished 
fifth Saturday. Blair won. RANDY HARVEY

 If the ski jumpers do as well today in competition as they did Saturday in 
practice, spectators can expect records on the big hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwegian star Espen Bredesen got things going with an unofficial record leap 
of 447 feet 8 inches (136.5 meters) off the 120-meter jump, then Jens Weissflog 
of Germany topped him, sailing 449-5 (137 meters). 
</P>
<P>
 "On this hill, I can jump 140 meters," Bredesen said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The first fake ticket of the Games -- or at least the first that was 
recognized -- turned up at the cross-country ski stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The ticketholder, a Swede, said he had bought the ticket from someone else, 
believing it to be genuine. 
</P>
<P>
 The ticket was described as being of fairly good quality by Liv-Grete Orvik, 
ticket-sales manager at that venue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For reasons not entirely clear, although it does involve a record of sorts, 
this bit of intelligence was on Saturday's Olympic news network: 
</P>
<P>
 "The people of Gudbrandsdalen (the area that makes up the Olympic region) are 
eating more goat cheese than ever. The dairy Ostlandsmeieriet Gudbrandsdal has 
sold 5.7 tons of goat cheese during January. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an increase of almost two tons, compared to last January. There has 
also been a considerable increase of sour cream and cream." MIKE KUPPER

LANGSTON WANTS ANGELS TO COMMIT TO AGGRESSIVENESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sinews in his neck stretched taut, Whitey Herzog scowled at pitcher Mark 
Langston and bellowed the question heard 'round the Angels' world. 
</P>
<P>
 "What more do you want from us?" Herzog asked in exasperation. "Just how much 
money do you need?" 
</P>
<P>
 Langston glared at him and, surprising even himself, raised his voice and 
snapped back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you what I want," Langston said, pointing at the flashy ring on 
Herzog's right finger. "I want one of those. I want what you have. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want a World Series ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want you to give us a chance to win a World Series." 
</P>
<P>
 Langston's point was painfully blunt, yet ever so eloquent. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, three months since that negotiating session in the Angel offices, Herzog 
is gone as general manager and Langston is back. Langston can still walk away 
as a free agent at the end of the season, but said this week that he's willing 
to commit his next four years to the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, he wants a simple commitment that the Angels will be aggressive in 
their quest to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've made that crystal-clear to the Angels," Langston, 33, said, "and they 
realize that. I can't emphasize how much I want to win. And I feel good that 
will happen now because we finally got somebody (General Manager Bill Bavasi) 
in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I didn't want to be here, I wouldn't be, because I've certainly been given 
all the chances to leave. But this is where I want to be and this is where I'd 
like to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Langston, who has yet to reach an agreement on a contract extension, will 
arrive today for the start of spring training with faith that the Angels will 
fulfill their promise. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe he's fooling himself, or perhaps the Angels have fooled him, but 
Langston is convinced that they have just as much chance of winning the 
American League West title as anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it may sound a bit crazy. This is a team that has finished a 
combined 84 games out of first place since Langston's arrival four years ago, 
and in the last two seasons, the Angels have finished 42 games under .500. 
</P>
<P>
 However, from the moment the Major League Players Assn. approved realignment 
in January, the outlook of the Angel organization changed. Why, with Chicago, 
Minnesota or Kansas City headed to the American League Central and only four 
teams left in the West, the Angels figured they might have a chance at winning 
their division. 
</P>
<P>
 They immediately acquired outfielders Bo Jackson and Dwight Smith, each of 
whom hit more homer runs in reserve roles last season than all but three 
Angels; they picked up relievers Craig Lefferts, Bob Patterson and Bill Sampen, 
who have appeared in more games -- 1,100 -- than the combined total of the 
Angels' tentative starting lineup, minus Chili Davis, and they signed starters 
Frank Tanana and John Dopson, both from 1993 playoff contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The realignment makes us instantly competitive," said Langston, who has been 
selected to the American League All-Star team the last three years. "The teams 
that are left aren't powerhouse teams. I really think we can win this whole 
ball of wax." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are left in a division with the Seattle Mariners, Texas Rangers and 
Oakland Athletics. The Mariners and Rangers have never won a division title, 
and Oakland finished in last place in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you'll see a different team this spring, one with a whole lot more 
confidence," Angel Manager Buck Rodgers said. "We had so many first-year kids 
last spring, I think guys were just happy to be here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, it's a whole different game. It's going to be like the Olympics. If you 
don't want to win, don't bother to show up." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, if nothing else, have attracted the attention of the Cactus 
League. They have already sold out their box seats for the spring and expect to 
have near-sellouts for every game. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the main attraction is Jackson, whose appearance may also relieve 
some of the pressure on other players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, I felt I was under a microscope," said first baseman J.T. Snow, 
who was acquired in the Jim Abbott trade, "but it won't be that way this 
spring. If anything, the spotlight is going to be on Bo and Tim (Salmon). I'll 
be able to go into spring without feeling like everyone's checking me out." 
</P>
<P>
 There still will be plenty of questions this year, but much of the uncertainty 
is gone. Despite the possibility that shortstop Gary DiSarcina will be the most 
experienced starting position player -- having been in the majors all of 2 1/2 
years -- the veteran pitching staff realizes that these kids belong in the big 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, they had no idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were just too many question marks last spring," Langston said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took a lot of marquee players off the team and gave doubts to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, we all knew that Tim Salmon had great years in the minor leagues, but 
there's a slew of players who have had great minor league careers and never 
made it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, after watching Tim and what everyone else did last year, and 
seeing some of the things we did this winter, I'm very, very encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I've got a funny feeling this could be our year."

 Canada's Kerrin Lee-Gartner, the 1992 Olympic downhill champion, finished 19th 
Saturday. But she wasn't the least bit dejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee-Gartner debated all week whether to race the downhill in light of the 
recent death of Austria's Ulrike Maier, a close friend. 
</P>
<P>
 After participating in downhill training, Lee-Gartner decided Friday to race. 
"A lot of people don't understand, my goal really is just to enjoy the sport 
again," Lee-Gartner said. "I felt good. I don't even know where I finished. I'm 
really happy, proud of myself, that I could go up there and enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee-Gartner said she might skip next week's downhill and return home to 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Maier's death also had an effect on Dee Street, mother of Picabo, silver 
medalist in Saturday's downhill. It was only after Dee learned to ski herself, 
she said, that she was able to watch her daughter ski without becoming a 
nervous wreck. 
</P>
<P>
 Picabo Street was leading the Jan. 29 downhill at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, 
Germany, in which Maier was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have watched that video over and over," Dee Street said. "I just had to 
come to the conclusion that it was her time." 
</P>
<P>
 Picabo said she has tried to calm her mother's fears: "I've told my mom, 
'Don't worry, I don't ever ski out of control, ever.' Ulli's was a terrible, 
terrible, freak accident. It was just destiny for her." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 American Hilary Lindh, the silver medalist in downhill at the 1992 Albertville 
Games, finished seventh. "I'm a little disappointed, but I skied well on the 
top and at least I have to feel good about that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also for the United States, Megan Gerety finished 20th and Krista Schmidinger 
finished 27th. CHRIS DUFRESNE

 Suzy Favor-Hamilton, who two weekends ago was up for the Leon Lett Award after 
a world-class mistake at the Mobil meet in Fairfax, Va., ran an entire mile at 
the 35th Sunkist Indoor Track Meet at the Sports Arena on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 11,569, Favor-Hamilton pulled away with a lap-and-a-quarter to go and 
easily won the women's race in 4 minutes 38.43 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Women highlighted the meet Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Heptathlon champion Jackie Joyner-Kersee ran a fast 50-meter hurdles race; 
Irina Privalova of Russia set a meet record in the 50 sprint, and world 800 
champion Maria Mutola barely missed a world indoor mark in the half mile. 
</P>
<P>
 In the men's mile, Marcus O'Sullivan of Ireland passed Marcus Dunbar of Oregon 
as the final lap began, then withstood a challenge by Lhoussine Siba of Morocco 
to win in 4:00.31. Siba was was second in 4:01.35. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Favor-Hamilton had the Mobil meet race in hand with a lap left 
when she inexplicably quit running and raised her arms in a victory gesture. It 
allowed an amazed Hassiba Boulmerka of Algeria, who continued running, to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Favor-Hamilton explained she had lost count of the laps. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Fairfax, I just couldn't see the lap counter and tonight I could," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Favor-Hamilton finished strides ahead of Sarah Thorset of the University of 
Wisconsin, who was finished in 4:40.1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight's race was a slow pace," Favor-Hamilton said. "I felt comfortable and 
very strong throughout. I want fast times like everyone else, but I'm also 
working on feeling good in a race, being strong and having fun, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Mozambique's Mutola was thought to have the best chance for a world record in 
this meet, and she came close. 
</P>
<P>
 She won in 2:00.21, just shy of Mary Decker-Slaney's 1980 record of 1:59.7. 
Mutola finished nearly eight seconds ahead of Arizona State's Kim Toney.  
</P>
<P>
 Mutola, who lives in Eugene, Ore., was an unbeaten world champion in 1993. 
This year, she hopes to set the 800-meter world outdoors record outdoors. She 
also wants to add variety to her running.  
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to do well at 200, 400 and 1,500 meters, in addition to the 800," 
she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Joyner-Kersee jumped on a strong women's 50-meter hurdles field and won 
easily, in 6.87 seconds. Her time was the fourth-fastest by an American. Still, 
she was not happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pleased I won, but I had sort of a pause at the first hurdle, and I 
should be accelerating through the first three hurdles," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I should be transferring what I do on the practice field to the competition, 
and tonight I didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Joyner-Kersee easily outpaced San Yiing Chan of USC (7.03), and Doris Williams 
(7.08). 
</P>
<P>
 The women's 50-meter dash was a featured event, until Privalova entered late 
last week and Olympic champion Gail Devers pulled out, demanding more money. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: No contest. At least for a night, Privalova was the fastest woman 
in Los Angeles. She took an instant lead, and flew down the wooden track in 
6.08, breaking Devers' 1993 meet record of 6.10. 
</P>
<P>
 Privalova said she would have run faster with Devers pressing her.  
</P>
<P>
 "If Gail had been here, we might have had a faster time," she said. "Two 
people running together makes for better concentration. It is hard to run 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
 In the men's 880, David Kiptoo of Kenya edged Ibrahim Aden of Central Arizona 
College by 0.01 of a second. Kiptoo's time was 1:51.25. Kiptoo unaccountably 
slowed down at the tape, mistakenly believing Aden was a distant second. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 50-meter hurdles for decathletes and jacks of other trades, UCLA long 
jumper Avery Anderson, in a near-blanket finish, beat decathletes Chris Huffins 
and Dan O'Brien, the world record holder. Anderson finished in a 6.63, O'Brien 
in 6.66. 
</P>
<P>
 Toni Li, a Hong Kong hurdler by way of Washington State, won the men's 
50-hurdle race in 6.50, then said his 1994 outdoor goal is a time of 13.10 in 
the 110 hurdles.  
</P>
<P>
 In the pole vault, Brent Burns, formerly of Cal, cleared 18 feet 8 1/4 inches, 
and Dean Starkey, formerly of Illinois, went 18-4 1/2. Outdoor and indoor world 
record holder Randy Barnes won the shotput by nearly five feet, at 66-3 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 The most outstanding high school performer was junior sprinter Bryan Howard of 
Moreno Valley Canyon Springs, who won the Football 50 meters in 5.69 seconds, 
the world's 14th best time. It also shattered the national prep record of 5.80.

WRANGLING OVER PAY IS BLOCK FOR DEVERS; DISPUTE: KERSEE SAYS HE HAD BEEN TOLD 
PRIVALOVA WOULDN'T COMPETE. THE PROMOTER DISAGREES. 
</P>

<P>
 They kept a lane open for Gail Devers until shortly before the women's 50 
meters Saturday night in the Sunkist Invitational at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 But America's No. 1 female track star of 1993, as she promised, was a no show. 
In her absence, Russia's Irina Privalova won easily, breaking the meet record 
with a time of 6.08 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Devers signed a contract worth $9,000 plus perks, her handlers, 
including Coach Bob Kersee, had her withdraw when meet promoter Al Franken 
would not pay her more money. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a major disagreement between Kersee and Franken on why Devers was 
withdrawn. Franken contended that Devers' handlers tried a strong-arm move. 
Kersee claimed Franken did not show good faith. That he signed Devers under 
false pretenses, telling him that Privalova was not competing. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the breach of the contract that Devers' handlers sent and Franken 
signed, the veteran track promoter said he would not sue. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just not my style," he said. "Gail wanted to compete, they wouldn't 
let her. I do plan on filing a protest with the IAAF and hope they will follow 
up on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a strong-arm attempt. They picked the wrong time to try those tactics. 
They live out here and they know about the earthquake. There was no way we 
could pay them more money. It was a shabby thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know until Wednesday that Privalova was going to compete. But I 
never said that she wouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would seem to me that anyone who really cares about track would have 
wanted to see the two great sprinters run. A matter of money should not have 
kept the fans from seeing a great match. After all, Irina broke Gail's record." 
</P>
<P>
 Kersee didn't see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We agreed to take minimum money to help the meet for both Gail and Jackie 
(Joyner-Kersee, his wife whom he also coaches)," he said. "But we took minor 
league money because we were facing minor league competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Irina was signed, that made it major league, and I'm not letting my 
girls face major opposition for minor league money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gail was upset because she wanted to run, but I told her no Olympic champion 
that I coach would compete in a major race for minor league money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was doing Al Franken a favor. I won't do that again." 
</P>
<P>
 Privalova, who has run a 6.01 this year to beat the world record, acknowledged 
that she was disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have run better if Devers had been here," she said. "The tougher the 
opposition, the more prepared I am to run. I was looking forward to racing 
against her. She is very good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel we could have come close to the world record. But I really wasn't 
ready for my best race." 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, in winning the Sunkist 50, Devers set a U.S. record of 6.10. In 
the nine times Privalova and Devers have faced each other, Devers has won 
seven. 
</P>
<P>
 But earlier this year, Privalova ran 6.03 and 6.01. Maybe Devers couldn't have 
beaten her anyhow.

NBA ROUNDUP; DUMARS LEADS PISTONS IN VICTORY FOR PRIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Dumars was called questionable in the pregame injury report, but there was 
no question he was ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumars scored 18 of his 40 points in the second quarter and made some key 
shots in the fourth at Dallas where the Detroit Pistons beat the Mavericks, 
105-96, Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumars sank two three-pointers early in the fourth quarter to help blunt 
Dallas rallies and help the Pistons to only their sixth road victory of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, it was Detroit's third victory in its last five games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know I was even listed (on the injury report)," said Dumars, who 
fell five points short of the high for his career. "We needed to win this game, 
and it was no time to come up short." 
</P>
<P>
 The need for the victory was largely generated by pride. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks are the only team in the NBA with a worse record than Detroit's. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you've won only (13) games, you can never feel anybody's a couple of 
rungs below you," Dumars said. "But we did look at this as a winnable game." 
</P>
<P>
 Jamal Mashburn and Jim Jackson scored 18 points apiece for Dallas, which lost 
its third consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 100, Miami 96 -- J.R. Reid scored a season-high 22 points and 
Dennis Rodman had 26 rebounds at San Antonio to lead the Spurs to their 12th 
victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 David Robinson had 19 points, 12 rebounds and five blocked shots for San 
Antonio, which hasn't lost since Jan. 20. Rodman had a season-high 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Smith had 24 points for the Heat and Glen Rice added 21. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 106, Phoenix 88 -- Vernon Maxwell scored 18 points in the first 18 
minutes and finished with 25 for the Rockets at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston snapped Phoenix's three-game winning streak and beat the Suns in the 
Summit for the eighth time in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Barkley, playing in his third consecutive game after missing 17 in a 
row because of a knee injury, had two airballs and three turnovers early in the 
first quarter but led the Suns with 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State 101, Boston 90 -- Chris Webber scored 11 of his game-high 20 
points in the fourth quarter for the Warriors, who held the Celtics to 11 
points in the final 12 minutes at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State, winning its fifth in a row, broke a four-game losing streak to 
Boston dating to Feb. 19, 1992.

BRADLEY'S SEASON ENDS AFTER COLLISION WITH GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shawn Bradley's rookie season came to an end Saturday in a doctor's office in 
suburban Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7-foot-6 Philadelphia 76er center was injured in a collision with Portland 
Trail Blazer forward Harvey Grant, leaving Bradley with a dislocated kneecap 
and a bone chip in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack McPhilemy, the team physician, is expected to conduct an arthroscopic 
evaluation in two or three days, General Manager Jim Lynam said. Surgery hasn't 
been scheduled, and rehabilitation is expected to take about three months. 
</P>
<P>
 "While this is a serious injury, (there is) no ligament damage," Lynam said. 
"Jack didn't feel there was any reason to doubt that he'll make a complete 
recovery within three months." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley was hurt 37 seconds into Philadelphia's 109-93 loss to Portland on 
Friday night. Bradley went up for a shot when his knee collided with Grant's 
left knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't know what happened," Bradley said. "I caught the ball, I 
turned, and my knee popped out and then it popped back in." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley, the second pick in the draft, averaged 10.5 points and 6.4 rebounds 
per game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's very fair to say that he's made significant progress," Lynam 
said. "It would have been my expectation that progress would have continued."

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; IN HARPER-CLIPPERS FEUD, THERE ARE NO WINNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's difficult to choose sides in the standoff between Ron Harper and the 
Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 On one hand, you have Harper, the $4-million ingrate, slouching through what 
undoubtedly has become his last Clipper season, moaning all the while that they 
haven't already re-signed him, that head bean counter Andy Roeser is out to get 
him, that the Sports Arena isn't suitable, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, you have the Clippers, the Little Shop of Horrors, who have 
failed to build a program their players could believe in. 
</P>
<P>
 A fool and his money, or the Clippers and a young star, are soon parted. 
Charles Smith, gone. Ken Norman, gone. Danny Manning, going. Harper, going. 
Mark Jackson signed a five-year extension this season, took a look at the way 
things were going around here and started wishing out loud for a trade. In a 
season or two, they will have to oblige him; he will be 29 or 30, and they will 
be rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 When Manning and Harper blew off that practice, Coach Bobby Weiss did the 
right thing and benched them, although he called their excuses "relatively 
legitimate." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, they had no excuses. A practice had been scheduled for 4:30 just to 
give players time to fly home. Manning overslept (agent Ron Grinker had the 
good grace to admit Manning was wrong, even if he blamed the Clippers for 
everything else). 
</P>
<P>
 Harper missed his plane back from Cleveland, leading to this priceless 
exchange with reporters: 
</P>
<P>
 Harper: "The rule now is if you miss practice and nobody died in your family, 
you can't play the next day. I don't care if you're sick, you have to bring 
your . . . in." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Were you sick? 
</P>
<P>
 Harper: "No, I was healthy. I just missed my flight and I don't feel sorry I 
missed it." 
</P>
<P>
 At least, Weiss made his point without going to war with his two stars. 
However, when Harper went off on another of his self-pitying bleats, referring 
to the balance of the season as "jail time," the organization lost suspended 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA Players Assn. promptly filed a grievance, arguing that a player has 
the right to say he's unhappy. Harper didn't criticize anyone; he only said he 
wanted out, for which he was fined, in effect, $48,780.49. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers don't know if they can win a grievance and don't care. There were 
sending everyone a message. 
</P>
<P>
 What now? 
</P>
<P>
 Only four more shopping days until the trade deadline. The Clippers have an 
assortment of low-ball offers for Manning. Chicago's Scottie Pippen wants the 
Bulls to trade for Harper. Harper hasn't guarded anything but a passing lane 
for years, but Pippen believes that in a real program, he would go back to 
playing honestly. He may be right, too. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't always this way. Remember when Harper arrived in November of 1989 
and led the Clippers on that East Coast winning streak? He was averaging 23 
points when he blew out his knee that January. Until then, he really was the 
next thing to Michael Jordan, but after that, it was only in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 He still had something, though. There was no one like him on the fast break. 
</P>
<P>
 But of Harper's last season with the Clippers, all you can say is: They 
deserved each other. THIS JUST IN: SNAKE'S HOMESICK! 
</P>
<P>
 Just when you thought the door only swung one way comes a Milwaukee Journal 
report that Norman, now on Mike Dunleavy's yo-yo, wants to be traded, maybe 
back to the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it were true," Norman said, "whether it's true or not, it's something that 
would be discussed within the family." 
</P>
<P>
 We will take that as a confirmation. However, Norman is signed for six 
seasons, and Dunleavy said he has no intention of trading a player just because 
he's unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
 Resigned, Norman went back to work with the Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow, I have to get my hungriness back, my aggressiveness," he said before 
last week's game against the Denver Nuggets. "I have to be prepared to go in 
there and tear someone's head off or get mine torn off." 
</P>
<P>
 That night, he entered the game at the start of the second quarter, got into a 
fight with Tom Hammonds 1:39 later and was ejected. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, Snake, the aggressiveness is back. Now work on the basketball. FOR THE 
LAKERS, THE NEW MATH 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers are more or less denying that they offered a choice of Anthony 
Peeler and Doug Christie, plus Elden Campbell and a No. 1 draft choice, for 
Derrick Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
 Their logjam at small forward and big guard, however, suggests otherwise. With 
the amazing development of George Lynch, they suddenly have two No. 2 guards 
for one spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the Nets weren't interested. The Lakers like to think their 
tradition can mellow out a problem player, but this guy looks like he would be 
$100 million worth of trouble in the kingdom of Heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 What to do when Christie and Peeler are back? Answer: Play them, even at the 
cost of sitting down Sedale Threatt and Tony Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-nosed Smith is their best defender. Threatt, 32, won two of the three 
games in the recent streak, almost single-handedly outgunning the Phoenix Suns 
and Utah Jazz in the fourth quarter, outscoring John Stockton and Kevin 
Johnson, 51-21. 
</P>
<P>
 There's still an incredible hunger for anything resembling respectability at 
the Forum, and soon the P word -- as in playoffs -- was being heard, pressing 
Coach Randy Pfund to play Threatt more. 
</P>
<P>
 But you're not rebuilding if you're playing veterans ahead of genuine 
prospects. Pfund could use Christie as the backup at the point, shooting guard 
and small forward positions and find 36 minutes a night for Christie, Lynch, 
Peeler and Nick Van Exel. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone knows the Lakers' kids are their future. Let's get to it. NEW MATH II 
</P>
<P>
 Van Exel is shooting 40%, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, not exactly. 
</P>
<P>
 With players taking more and more three-pointers, the old shooting percentage 
is becoming a less valid measure of a player's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Since a player gets an extra point, a 33% mark from the three-point line 
equals 50% from inside it. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost one-third of Van Exel's shots come from beyond the arc, so his overall 
percentage will be lower. 
</P>
<P>
 How to measure it in a single percentage? Jordan Cohn, author of the annual 
"Pro Basketball Bible," has devised a "true shooting percentage," which weights 
three-pointers. For every three-pointer a player makes, you add half a field 
goal. Thus, if a player was one for two inside the arc and one for two on 
three-pointers, he would have a true shooting percentage of 62.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 By this measure, Van Exel is shooting 45%. THAT'LL SHOW HIM 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA's hottest team? 
</P>
<P>
 The Spurs, winners of 22 of 25, 11 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 They still don't have a real point guard, but David Robinson is having an MVP 
season, raising his scoring average four points from last season in reply to 
Coach John Lucas' taunts to show him something. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson leads the NBA with five triple-doubles and last week compiled the 
first quad-double (34 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists, 10 blocks) in four 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spurs have replaced New York as the league's top defensive team. A year 
ago, they were middle-of-the-pack rebounders but are now No. 3. This is 
attributable to Dennis Rodman, who's 25% ahead of the field but was left off 
the All-Star team in this season's greatest miscarriage of justice. Just 
because a man dies his hair several colors, tattoos his arms, comes late to 
everything, skips shootarounds on the theory he isn't going to shoot, doesn't 
talk to teammates and snaps out occasionally, it doesn't mean he isn't great. 
</P>
<P>
 As wacky as he is, Rodman wins. Last season, the Pistons were 36-26 with him, 
4-16 without him. Since he left, they're 12-38. ALL-STAR WRAPUP 
</P>
<P>
 Biggest hype: Isaiah Rider's between-the-legs dunk. The crowd's reaction won 
him the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Most in-character reaction: Rider, who said: "When I was drafted, I said I was 
going to win the slam-dunk contest and I did. I backed it up. I've got to love 
myself for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Worst new idea: Trying to save the dunk contest with MC's Fresh Prince and 
Jazzy Jeff. This turkey needs more than two guys with baseball caps on backward 
yelling, "Give it up, y'all!" 
</P>
<P>
 Best new idea: Dropping the dunk contest to No. 2, making the three-point 
contest the featured event on All-Star Saturday. A better idea would be moving 
the dunk contest to Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Best performance: Mark Price hitting 20 of his first 22 in the three-point 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-best performance: David Stern schmoozing Minnesota Gov. Arne Carlson, 
seated next to him at the game. The best bet is the Timberwolves will stay in 
Minneapolis, the city and state will find themselves in the arena business. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst prediction: Three-point contestant Steve Kerr: "I figure I've got the 
advantage. I'm the only one who really needs the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Worst performance: Nike. More than anything else, the game is an exhibition of 
the shoe makers' new models. Nike's collection of the grotesque included 
Pippen's red clodhoppers -- "The first thing I said to him was, 'Take those 
shoes off! " Robinson said; the Air Jordans that made B.J. Armstrong and Mitch 
Richmond look like little old ladies in sneakers and Latrell Sprewell's black 
high-tops that looked like combat boots. 
</P>
<P>
 Second worst performance: The game went up against the opening ceremonies of 
the Winter Olympics and drew a 9.1 rating, down 57% from last year. FACES AND 
FIGURES 
</P>
<P>
 Shaquille O'Neal, 22, lobbying against trading for Danny Manning: "I've asked, 
and someone assured me it's not going to happen. It was man-to-man, 
face-to-face, and I'd be disappointed if someone would look me in the face and 
said nothing was going to happen and it happens. The trade doesn't make sense. 
We don't need Manning. We already have 12 superstars on the team. We don't need 
another. Too many superstars create too many ego problems." . . . Actually, the 
Magic has one superstar, one blue-chip prospect (Anfernee Hardaway), one good 
player (Nick Anderson) and nine journeymen. Included is O'Neal's buddy, Dennis 
Scott, who was in the Orlando offer to the Clippers. . . . Pooh Richardson, out 
because of a bruised calf and/or feelings as the Pacers climbed back into the 
playoff picture, has been told by Coach Larry Brown that his return is no 
longer his decision but a club decision. . . . The Gang That Couldn't Shoot 
40%: How slow was Derek Harper's start in New York? Greg Anthony is expected to 
keep the starting job. Harper is averaging six points, three assists and 
shooting 35%. Anthony is shooting 38%. John Starks shot 38% for the first eight 
games this month, and the Knicks went 4-4. After a 20-point loss in New Jersey, 
Patrick Ewing said they were "playing like wimps."

GOLF / DAN HAFNER; GEIBERGER TO DEFEND OJAI TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If it's early in the year and the golf tournament is in Southern California, 
Al Geiberger is a strong threat to win it all. 
</P>
<P>
 The former USC player, now in his eighth season on the Senior PGA Tour, is 
confident he can shake off injury problems and retain his championship in the 
$550,000 GTE West tournament. The first full-field senior event of the year in 
the Southland will be held at Ojai Valley Inn March 4-6, and most of the top 
players on the 50-and-older circuit will be there to challenge him. 
</P>
<P>
 Geiberger has won nine tournaments on the tour and most have come early, in 
his home area. Geiberger, who lives in Solvang, has scored all but three of 
those victories in the West. Even on the regular tour, Geiberger recalled, he 
never won in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up on bent grass greens," he said. "And most of my friends show up 
when I play in the area, but I really don't know why I do so well here. I keep 
telling myself that I putt much better on Bermuda grass greens than I used to, 
but I still haven't won in Florida." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime this season, Geiberger will have to take time off for surgery because 
of a rotator cuff tear in his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, it doesn't hurt as much as (my) heel," Geiberger said from his 
home in Solvang while resting his injuries for a week. "Doctors say the heel 
will heal (without surgery), but the rotator cuff won't. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a dilemma. The problem is how bad a tear it is. If it's only slight, 
arthroscopic surgery can clean it up and I'll only be out three months. If it's 
a mess in there, I'll be out six months.  
</P>
<P>
 "The only time it hurts is at the top of the backswing when I stretch and (at) 
the end of the follow-through. It would make it easier to make the decision if 
I could repeat at Ojai. Otherwise, I hope I can make it through half of the 
year, at least, (without an operation). 
</P>
<P>
 "The real pain is in the heel. I've tried cortisone and orthopedics. They wrap 
it before a round in the fitness tent, and it feels great for about 12 holes. 
It doesn't help to ride a cart, because it starts hurting every time I get out 
of the cart." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it was somewhat of a surprise that Geiberger won at Ojai last year. 
He usually plays better on long, demanding courses. But he conquered the short 
and tight Ojai Valley layout. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a position course," Geiberger said. "You can't get greedy or 
you'll pay the price. The birdies are out there, and the key is just to give 
yourself enough chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do believe that the shoulder injury has cut down a bit on the distance of 
my drives, but that shouldn't be a problem at Ojai." 
</P>
<P>
 What figures to be a problem, though, is the competition. Isao Aoki, who 
faltered at the finish last year to lose by two shots; Dave Stockton, the 
senior golfer of the year; Bob Murphy; George Archer; Jim Colbert and Bob 
Charles figure to contend at Ojai. And Arnold Palmer, who had one of his finest 
tournaments there a year ago, will also be there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither of my injuries occurred when I was playing golf," Geiberger said. 
"The shoulder injury came when my son, John, and I were trying to figure out 
which of us had the longer reach. We were stretching toward the ceiling in a 
room a little over a year ago. An hour or so later, I felt pain. That was the 
start of it. The heel injury came during the Senior Open when I was 
high-stepping up some stairs as part of my exercise program. The heel doesn't 
hurt when I swing, only when I walk. I try taking a week or two off, but the 
only thing that would help is to stay in bed, and I can't do that." 
</P>

<P>
 Although Senior PGA Tour officials say no decision has been made, Tom Kite 
said the seniors will have their own Tournament of Champions, ending their 
association with the PGA Tour at La Costa. . . . A spin-off series is planned 
for those who don't qualify for the Senior PGA Tour. It would include 15 
tournaments.

HOCH LEADS BY FOUR AFTER 'ONLY' A 66; GOLF: GLASSON, HUSTON TIED FOR SECOND. 
GALLAGHER SMASHES RECORD AT BERMUDA DUNES WITH 62. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ROBLEDO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Hoch was more than a little surprised when he came off the 18th hole at 
Bermuda Dunes and learned that he had a four-stoke lead going into today's 
final round of the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 He had just birdied the last three holes to cap a round of six-under-par 66 
that left him at 24-under 264. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a pretty nice score, but there have been so many sub-65 rounds all week 
on the four courses in this tournament, he expected somebody to make a big 
move. 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody did. It was Jim Gallagher Jr., who set a course record at Bermuda 
Dunes with a 10-under-par 62, to break the record of 63 set by Jodie Mudd in 
1986. Gallagher, however, had shot a 74 on the previous day and the best he 
could do was gain a fourth-place tie at 269 with Keith Clearwater (68 at La 
Quinta), Bruce Lietzke (67 at Indian Wells) and third-round leader Lennie 
Clements (72 at Bermuda Dunes). 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Glasson and John Huston also made moves. Glasson, who says he has been 
experimenting with his swing this week, shot a 66 at Indian Wells and is tied 
for second at 268 with Huston, who shot a 68 at La Quinta. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scores really did surprise me," Hoch said. "This was a perfect day for 
scoring and I was sure there would a lot of low scores." 
</P>
<P>
 After a round that got off to a slow start, Hoch was feeling much better when 
he saw his name atop the leader board.  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't really want to know where I stood during the round," Hoch said. "I 
just wanted to concentrate on my game and not worry about anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 That was easy to do at Bermuda Dunes, because all of the fans were at Indians 
Wells, where the celebrity field was playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have much of a gallery all week," Hoch said. "I left about four 
tickets for friends, but they were watching other people."  
</P>
<P>
 Everything will change today. Hoch will be playing in front of large crowds at 
Indian Wells and he will know where he stands because he will be playing in the 
last group with Huston and Glasson. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the second time Hoch has played in the last round with Glasson 
this year. He was paired with him at Phoenix, where Glasson closed with a 64 to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was on another level there," Hoch said. "I played well, but it was nothing 
like the way he was playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Glasson apparently doesn't have the same confidence in his game that Hoch has. 
In fact, Glasson is so dissatisfied with the way he is striking the ball, he 
will be experimenting with his swing today, trying to find something that will 
make it right. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it's hard to explain being 20 under and complaining about my swing, 
but if you would have watched me on the first day, you couldn't have told which 
ones were the amateurs." 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing that has been saving Glasson is his putter. And that's unusual, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Putting is usually the weakest part of my game," Glasson said. "I usually hit 
some great iron shots and struggle with my putter." 
</P>
<P>
 Glasson said that the problem is his new swing. He doesn't completely 
understand it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what I'm trying to do," he said, "but when things start to go wrong, I 
don't understand the little changes that need to be made." 
</P>
<P>
 Glasson says he has made about 135 swing changes so far this week and will go 
to 136 and more in the final round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't expect to be in contention this week," Glasson said. "I 
wanted to work on my swing and this is a good tournament to do it in, because 
you get to play (at least) four rounds. I don't usually make the cut here, so 
this will be an interesting last day." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Glasson, Hoch says he's not completely happy with the way he's hitting 
the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not getting the draw that I'm used to," Hoch said. "But at least I have a 
four-stroke lead, which is better than being four behind." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoch says he won't play safe to protect a lead. But he's going to be 
experimenting with his swing to try to make it better. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I've been doing has worked OK for four rounds. It should work for one 
more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
 It took a score of five-under 283 to make the cut. Among those who missed it 
were defending champion Tom Kite (286), Los Angeles Open champion Corey Pavin 
(285), Arnold Palmer (286), Phil Mickelson (287), Lanny Wadkins (294) and Ben 
Crenshaw (307). . . . Steve Pate made it by a stroke, thanks a hole in one on 
the seventh hole at Bermuda Dunes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Gallagher says that a change in attitude was the reason he was able to go 
from a 74 on Friday to a 62 on Saturday. "I had been trying to call Paul 
(Azinger) for three weeks. I finally got through and he said a few things to me 
that woke me up. It made a world of difference. I went from being out of it to 
having a chance. I would probably need a seven or eight under to have a 
legitimate chance, but you never know on these course." Gallagher, who had an 
ace at PGA West earlier in the week, said they gave him the flagstick where he 
had his hole-in-one. "A car would have been nicer, but I'll take the stick."

BIG WEST ROUNDUP; NEW MEXICO STATE HAS ENOUGH TO HANDLE CAL STATE FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Dockery scored 19 points and had 11 rebounds for New Mexico State, which 
used a series of second-half defensive stands to hold off Cal State Fullerton 
in an 85-68 victory at Los Cruces, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans (6-17, 4-11) had several second-half runs, but each time they 
challenged, New Mexico State (19-3, 11-2) answered, finally outscoring 
Fullerton, 17-9, in the closing minutes.

 Nevada Las Vegas 80, UC Irvine 64 -- Kebu Stewart scored 16 of his 23 points 
in the second half to lead the Rebels at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart set an arena rebound record of 24, 17 in the second half, in beating 
the Anteaters for the 11th consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Runnin' Rebels (11-11, 7-7 Big West) trailed by four points with 13:10 to 
play when Stewart took control of the game. He was fouled on a layup and 
converted the three-point play with 9:54 left to put UNLV ahead to stay 51-50. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters (6-16, 3-11) were led by Todd Whitehead's 15 points.

 Pacific 78, San Jose State 62 -- Charles Terrell scored 15 points in a victory

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; SENIORS SIT, SO FRESHMEN LEAD TAR HEELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eric Montross, an All-American, was playing poorly, and then he wasn't playing 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Reese, a good shooter and rebounder, wasn't doing either, so he was 
sitting with Montross. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Salvadori was a 7-foot starter who didn't start. 
</P>
<P>
 They are all seniors, and North Carolina Coach Dean Smith has always put a lot 
of stock in his seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Saturday, the coach of the No. 2 Tar Heels sent them a message: play 
hard or sit. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvadori didn't start, and Montross and Reese were benched to start the 
second half after combining for four points and three rebounds in the first 
half of Saturday's 69-56 victory over Virginia at Chapel Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 It broke a two-game losing streak, something North Carolina isn't used to. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I just wanted to shake them up, make them mad at me and maybe play 
better," Smith said. "Doc Gooden gets taken out some, too -- sometimes as early 
as the third inning. The difference is, he can't come back in." 
</P>
<P>
 Montross, who finished two for 10 from the field for seven points, said he 
deserved to be benched. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't playing well and for someone else to go in who was playing better at 
the time was probably a good move," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Jeff McInnis scored a season-high 16 points and North Carolina had a 
19-2 second-half run while holding Virginia without a basket for more than 11 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tar Heels, 21-5 overall and 9-4 in the Atlantic Coast Conference, trailed 
by as many as eight points in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 But McInnis and freshman Jerry Stackhouse, who had 17 points, picked up the 
slack as North Carolina beat Virginia (13-9, 7-6) at home for the 50th time in 
53 games. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1 Arkansas 90, Mississippi 73 -- Corliss Williamson, who played only five 
minutes in the first half because of foul trouble, scored 19 points in the 
second for the Razorbacks at Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 His successive baskets put Arkansas (20-2, 10-2 Southeastern Conference) on 
top, 44-40, early in the second half and the Rebels (11-11, 4-8) never caught 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No. 3 Connecticut 81, Providence 73 -- Donyell Marshall scored 27 points at 
Storrs, Conn., where the Huskies remained unbeaten in 13 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 After trailing by two points at halftime, UConn (22-3, 12-2 Big East) took 
charge with a 20-10 run that included three three-pointers and two dunks from 
Marshall and Ray Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 Providence (12-9, 5-8) has lost four of its last five. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No. 7 Michigan 72, No. 20 Minnesota 65 -- Jalen Rose scored 25 points at Ann 
Arbor, Mich., as the Wolverines won their eighth in a row and ended Minnesota's 
four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory left Michigan (19-4, 11-2) alone atop the Big Ten while the 
Gophers (18-8, 8-5) dropped three games off the pace. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines are unbeaten since a 63-58 defeat at Minnesota on Jan. 20. But 
they played that game without Juwan Howard and Jimmy King, both of whom had the 
chicken pox. Howard had 19 points and King 11 this time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No. 16 Indiana 82, No. 9 Purdue 80 -- Todd Lindeman hit two free throws with 
seven seconds to play at Bloomington, Ind., where the Hoosiers won their 42nd 
game in a row despite 39 points by the Boilermakers' Glenn Robinson, the 
nation's leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue (21-4, 9-4) rallied from 10 points down with six minutes to go, 
catching Indiana, 80-80, with 23 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Lindeman was fouled while going up for a dunk, hit his free throws and a 
last-second shot by Purdue's Matt Waddell was blocked by Alan Henderson. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 No. 11 Kentucky 77, Vanderbilt 69 -- Coach Rick Pitino benched Travis Ford, 
Tony Delk and Gimel Martinez in the first half and the Wildcats responded with 
a 17-4 run in putting away the Commodores at Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford finished with 22 points for Kentucky (20-5, 9-3 SEC), which took 
advantage of 22 turnovers by Vanderbilt (13-9, 6-6). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Boston College 89, No. 14 Syracuse 83 -- Bill Curley scored 23 points and 
keyed a decisive run at Newton, Mass., where the Eagles completed their first 
regular-season sweep of Syracuse since 1981-82. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orangemen (17-5, 9-5 Big East) led 75-72 before Curley's two free throws 
with 5:48 to play started a 9-0 spurt by Boston College (18-7, 9-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Eisley scored 21 points for the Eagles. Lawrence Moten paced Syracuse 
with 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No. 17 Florida 88, South Carolina 64 -- Dan Cross had a career-high six 
three-pointers and finished with 24 points at Gainesville, Fla., where the 
Gators (21-4, 11-2 SEC) never trailed and committed only one first-half 
turnover. 
</P>
<P>
 South Carolina (6-16, 2-10) was led by Jamie Watson, who had 12 points on 
four-for-15 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No. 18 Saint Louis 73, No. 21 Alabama- Birmingham 72 -- H Waldman made two 
three-pointers in overtime and clinched the victory at St. Louis with two free 
throws with 4.4 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Saint Louis (20-3, 6-3 Great Midwest) stretched its home winning streak to 14, 
rebounded from consecutive road losses and ended a seven-game losing streak 
against Alabama-Birmingham (18-6, 6-4). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Northwestern 75, No. 24 Wisconsin 71 -- Kevin Rankin, a De Pere, Wis., native 
who got away from the state university, scored 23 points in an upset victory 
for the Wildcats at Madison. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwestern (11-10, 2-10) won it at the free-throw line, making 22 of 26, 
while Wisconsin (15-7, 6-7) was 10 for 13.

 No. 25 Georgia Tech 71, Wake Forest 69 -- James Forrest scored 23 points at 
Atlanta, where the Yellow Jackets (14-9, 5-7 Atlantic Coast) held off a Wake 
Forest (16-9, 6-6) rally. OTHER GAMES

USC HAS A REASON TO SMILE; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: FRESHMEN JONES AND BOSEMAN SPARK 
A 68-56 VICTORY OVER ARIZONA STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 USC freshman Avondre Jones tried his best to keep cool while answering 
questions from reporters after the Trojans' 68-56 victory over Arizona State on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 That was until fellow freshman Stais Boseman asked from across the locker room 
if he could get an autograph from Jones, who responded with a smile he and 
Boseman have waited all season to show. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about time," said Boseman, who joined Jones off the bench to give USC a 
defensive boost in easily their best performance of the season. "It feels good 
to finally play well together like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is exactly how USC Coach George Raveling felt after watching the Trojans 
bounce back from a 34-point loss at Arizona on Thursday to play their most 
complete game of the season and win their first road game in more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans, whose last road victory came at Washington on Jan. 13, played 
like a different team than the lethargic version that lost to Arizona two days 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 From point guard Burt Harris' driving layup that gave USC a 2-0 lead to open 
the game, the Trojans displayed a fight that was missing in losing eight of 
their last nine games before Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 One big reason for the new look was Jones, a 6-foot-11 center, who entered the 
game averaging only 3.4 points and 2.6 rebounds. He scored 11 points and 
grabbed four rebounds as the Trojans took a 30-22 first-half lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vonnie continues to grow and show the vast potential that he has," Raveling 
said. "He's a lot more focused now than he was early in the season. He's not 
fighting himself mentally like he was." 
</P>
<P>
 Another key to USC's fast start was the pressure defense on Arizona State's 
Stevin Smith, who scored 35 points in the Sun Devils' 87-62 victory over USC 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
 With Harris and Boseman forcing him to go inside, Smith scored only six points 
in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time we played, (Smith) played out of his mind," said Harris, who 
led USC with 17 points despite playing with foul trouble for most of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did a good job on him this game in not really allowing him many open shots 
and forcing him to dribble. But you really can't stop a player like that. You 
can only slow him down some." 
</P>
<P>
 Which proved true early in the second half, when Smith, who finished with 22 
points, made two consecutive three pointers to cut USC's lead to 35-34.  
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans, who blew early leads in losing their last two games, responded 
with six points each by Harris and Lorenzo Orr and outscored Arizona State, 
21-4, over the next eight minutes to take a 56-38 lead with 6:58 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun Devils then made their last push of the game with Smith scoring seven 
points to cut USC's lead to 60-53, but the Trojans answered with big defensive 
plays from Boseman, Jones and backup point guard Damaine Powell, who scored 
five points and made a steal down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior forward Tremayne Anchrum added 13 points and a team-high eight rebounds 
for USC, which improved to 12-10 overall and 5-8 in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones finished with a career-high 13 points and seven rebounds and made a huge 
impact defensively by altering many of the shots by the Sun Devils (12-10, 
7-6), while Boseman forced four turnovers and had two steals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that we both have a long way to go, but we also realize that we have 
the physical tools," Boseman said. "We just have to get the mental part down."

 Jeff Brown scored 24 points Saturday to lead Gonzaga to a 75-71 victory at 
Portland that clinched the West Coast Conference title for the Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Houle, who had 15 first-half points, led Portland with 18.Jerry Allen and 
Ray Ross added 13 apiece for the Pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Allen's three-pointer with 1:44 to play in the first half gave Portland 
(12-15, 5-7) its biggest lead, 39-22. The Pilots led, 60-50, midway through the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 An 11-3 run in the next 3:22 pulled Gonzaga (19-5, 11-1) to within 63-61. 
Brown's layup with 3:40 tied the game, 69-69. 
</P>
<P>
 John Rillie's three-point field goal with 36 seconds left put Gonzaga ahead 
for good, 72-71.

 Pepperdine 76, San Diego 57 -- It was the final home game for Pepperdine 
seniors Dana Jones and Damin Lopez and both went out in a big way. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez scored a season-high 27 points and Jones broke the school's all-time 
record for rebounds as the Waves won before 1,823 at Firestone Fieldhouse in 
Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' 11 rebounds gave him 975 for his career, three more than former player 
Levy Middlebrooks. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory moved Pepperdine (14-10, 6-6) into no worse than a tie for third 
in the conference with San Diego (14-9, 6-6). MITCH POLIN

BYRDSONG WILL RESUME HIS DUTIES AS NORTHWESTERN'S COACH MONDAY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Northwestern Coach Ricky Byrdsong, who has been on a leave of absence since 
displaying odd behavior during a game, will return to his duties Monday and 
will be on the bench for Thursday night's game against No. 16 Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Taylor, athletic director, released a statement Saturday that said 
Byrdsong, 37, "has been evaluated and we are satisfied that he can return to 
coaching and be successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Byrdsong has been on a leave of absence since a Big Ten game at Minnesota on 
Feb. 7. During that game, he turned over the coaching duties to assistant Paul 
Swanson, got a technical foul for walking onto the court to argue a call and 
walked through the crowd, shaking hands and giving high-fives. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, he met with the media and explained that his behavior at 
Minnesota was a motivational ploy, not a nervous breakdown.

NEWSWIRE: VIRUS DAMAGED HEART, LEWIS' AUTOPSY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The death of Reggie Lewis, Boston Celtic captain, was the result of a viral 
infection severely damaging his heart, leaving him vulnerable to the kind of 
abnormal heart rhythm that killed him last July, according to his death 
certificate. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton C. Kessler, the associate chief medical examiner of Massachusetts who 
signed the death certificate, told the New York Times that a virus was found in 
Lewis' heart and it caused myocarditis, an inflammation that scars and enlarges 
the heart. Although the myocarditis had healed, Kessler told the newspaper that 
Lewis' heart remained scared and enlarged when he collapsed and died while 
shooting baskets at Brandeis University in the Boston area. 
</P>
<P>
 The death certificate is expected to help clarify Lewis' case. After he 
collapsed last April in a playoff game against the Charlotte Hornets, his 
condition became a highly publicized medical dispute among Boston doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis was examined by 12 experts who concluded that he suffered from a 
life-threatening disease that would most likely end his career. But he abruptly 
left their care to get another opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 That came from Gilbert H. Mudge, director of clinical cardiology at a Harvard 
teaching hospital, who said Lewis suffered from a benign neurological disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the differing views, Lewis had a team of L.A. specialists review 
the data. They were unable to determine which diagnosis was correct, but wanted 
Lewis monitored closely. 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler told the New York Times, "I found evidence of disease, lots of it." 
The pathologist identified the virus as adenovirus type 2, one of several types 
viruses that can cause myocarditis. Basketball  
</P>
<P>
 The Detroit Pistons rejected a trade for Sacramento center Duane Causwell, 
saying he failed to pass a physical examination because of an unspecified 
problem. The failed physical means that center Olden Polynice and forward David 
Wood return to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA said that Roy Tarpley, who was banished in 1991 because of drug 
problems, has applied for reinstatement, and, at the request of his agent, the 
Dallas Mavericks have talked with their 7-foot center, who plays in Greece.

DAVENPORT EARNING HER DEGREE AS PRO; TENNIS: MURRIETA VALLEY HIGH SENIOR IS 
KNOCKING ON THE DOOR OF TOP 10 AS SHE READIES FOR EVERT CUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lindsay Davenport turned professional during her junior year at Murrieta 
Valley High last February, with the goal of breaking into the top 50 during her 
first year on the Women's Tennis Assn. tour. 
</P>
<P>
 It took her all of two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport, quickly gaining a reputation as one of the tour's hardest hitters, 
is on the verge of the top 10 as she enters the Evert Cup, which starts Monday 
at Hyatt Grand Champions in Indian Wells. 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport, 17, launched her pro career in the Evert Cup last year, reaching 
the quarterfinals. The next week, she upset Gabriela Sabatini in the round of 
16 at the Virginia Slims of Florida and moved to No. 48 in the WTA computer 
rankings -- after starting her pro career at No. 99. 
</P>
<P>
 She hasn't been out of the top 50 since, peaking at No. 12 two weeks ago, when 
for seven days she was the top-ranked U.S.-born player on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really kind of been amazing," said Davenport, currently ranked 14th. 
</P>
<P>
 Still in school -- she will graduate in June during a trip home to Riverside 
County between the French Open and Wimbledon -- she has won two tournaments and 
earned more than $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport, Tennis magazine's 1993 female rookie of the year, started the new 
year by winning a tournament in Brisbane, Australia, and reaching the 
quarterfinals at the Australian Open, her best showing in a Grand Slam event. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's definitely up and coming," said Mary Joe Fernandez, who lost to 
Davenport in the round of 16 at the Australian Open. "She's a very strong girl 
and hits the ball extremely hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Gigi Fernandez said Davenport has developed "a forehand as good as Steffi 
Graf's." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynne Rolley, director of player development for the U.S. Tennis Assn., said 
Davenport's potential is unlimited, adding: "She could be a No. 1 player." 
</P>
<P>
 Her rapid rise has come as a shock to Davenport. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all happened kind of fast," she said. "Every week, it just seemed like 
my ranking kept going up. I don't think you can predict that." 
</P>
<P>
 It might come as a surprise to those who know her parents, Wink and Ann, that 
Davenport has achieved such success in tennis and not in volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 feet 2, she is a towering figure on a tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, who is 6-8, played on the U.S. Olympic volleyball team in 1968, 
worked as a volleyball referee in the 1984 Los Angeles Games and is now 
secretary of the international referees committee of FIBA, the sport's 
international governing body. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother, who is 5-10, is commissioner of the Southern California Volleyball 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 One sister, Leiann, 33, played volleyball at UC Irvine, and the other, 
Shannon, 20, plays at St. Mary's College. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents, though, urged Lindsay to try another sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her (youngest) sister was playing volleyball, and we didn't want the two of 
them competing against one another," her father said. "We wanted them to 
develop their own habits and their own competitiveness." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother had recently started playing tennis, so Lindsay, 7 at the time, 
asked if she could play, too. Until two years ago, the family lived on the 
Palos Verdes Peninsula, not far from where Tracy Austin grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Lansdorp, a coach who had worked with Austin, also tutored Davenport. 
</P>
<P>
 "He taught her great fundamentals," Ann Davenport said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport was 14 when the USTA asked her to join the junior national team. 
</P>
<P>
 A rapid growth spurt -- about six inches in two years -- affected her 
coordination and left her muscles weakened, but didn't keep her from improving. 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport started thinking about turning pro when she began to dominate her 
competition at the junior level. She swept the singles and doubles titles at 
the National Girls' 18s and Clay Court Championships in 1991 and won the Junior 
U.S. Open in '92. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pro tennis was never a goal," she said. "It was kind of more like a dream. I 
always really wanted to go to college and play college tennis. It just turned 
out that I improved really quickly and was ready to play pro tennis." 
</P>
<P>
 She made the move after reaching the third round of the '93 Australian Open as 
an amateur. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother said: "She came home and said, 'I've been doing some thinking and 
if I want to get any better, I have to move up to the next level.' It came as a 
shock. We weren't quite ready for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Her daughter was. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she has continued to climb in the rankings, Lindsay Davenport sees 
plenty of room for improvement. Despite her size, she is reluctant to charge 
the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty much a baseliner," she said. "I've got to work at coming in, and I 
have been doing that the last year a little more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can improve on a lot of things. First, my fitness, so I can get faster on 
the court. That will be a big key -- if I can improve that. I'm trying to 
improve my serve and make it a really big weapon. It's gotten better in the 
last year, and it can still get better."

 Trooper Robert Mayra will never forget the scene: the mangled snowmobile that 
had rammed a concrete bridge abutment at 75 m.p.h., the broken bodies of the 
two young riders. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids, they just feel they're invincible . . . and all of a sudden, 
bang, it's over," Mayra said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 30, the teen-age victims and another couple left a party for a 
moonlight spin on the trails. Investigators said the driver of the doomed 
machine lost control trying to pass the other. State Police lab tests showed he 
had been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcohol and high speed, a deadly combination in countless highway crashes, are 
leading culprits in a rising tide of tragedy on snowmobile trails. 
</P>
<P>
 No federal agency keeps a national count of snowmobiling fatalities. The 
Consumer Product Safety Commission says 11,943 people were hurt in snowmobiling 
accidents in 1992, the latest numbers available. The total increased 22% in 
three years, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Michigan, which leads the nation in registered snowmobiles with more than 
200,000, the death toll has risen steadily -- from 11 in 1989-90 to 26 last 
winter. Halfway through this season, at least 14 have died. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin's annual death rate nearly tripled in a decade and hit 22 last 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two-thirds of the Michigan deaths in the past three years involved 
alcohol, said Bruce Gustafson, recreation supervisor in the Law Enforcement 
Division of the state Department of Natural Resources. 
</P>
<P>
 They are a legacy of a bar-hopping tradition that began with snowmobiling's 
emergence as popular recreation in the 1960s, when the typical machine lumbered 
along crude forest trails at 25 m.p.h. Many of today's sleek, powerful models 
exceed 100 m.p.h. and accelerate quicker than a sports car on smooth, hard 
trails. 
</P>
<P>
 "New technology -- both in the machines and the grooming of trails -- has 
resulted in a sport that has changed considerably from the way it started out," 
said Capt. Curt Bacon, chief DNR law enforcement officer in Michigan's Upper 
Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 The drunken snowmobiler is a sensitive matter in Upper Midwestern states, 
where the sport has become a pillar of the tourist economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of towns across the region previously had little to offer in winter. 
Now they eagerly woo snowmobilers, who spend millions on fuel, food, lodging 
and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's big business," said Sue Wagner, spokeswoman for the Michigan Travel 
Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters describe snowmobiling as wholesome family fun, insisting the 
boozers and speed demons are a small minority. 
</P>
<P>
 "The media focuses on the bad apples," said Kay Lloyd of Kirkland, Wash., 
chairwoman of the International Snowmobile Council, an umbrella group 
representing riders' clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 She said drunkenness is becoming less of a problem because of safety campaigns 
sponsored by clubs, snowmobile manufacturers, beer companies and government 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen anybody drunk at my place yet," said Rick Bradway, who 
welcomes snowmobilers at his Munising, Mich., motel. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may be a minority but it's a significant minority," said Mike McDonnell, 
a Michigan conservation officer who often patrols trails searching for 
intoxicated riders. He vividly recalls the one who refused to stop and plowed 
into a fellow officer, who miraculously escaped serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of idiots out there," said Ken Rutka, a Chicago firefighter who 
recently toured Michigan's Upper Peninsula by snowmobile. 
</P>
<P>
 Sipping coffee in a Munising tavern on a below-zero night, Rutka said he knows 
snowmobilers who habitually ride after drinking too much. "Their days are 
numbered," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 All agree the typical drunken rider is a male between ages 20 and 35, 
traveling with two or three companions. Roy Muth, president of a snowmobile 
manufacturers' trade group, said its research showed most violators don't 
belong to clubs and have had no safety training. 
</P>
<P>
 "Youngsters. They drink and hop on their machines and see who's fastest," 
McDonnell said during a recent patrol in Michigan's rural Marquette County. 
</P>
<P>
 "They get this 'Dukes of Hazzard' mentality . . . try to get the cops to chase 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Hampered by funding and personnel shortages, police can patrol only a fraction 
of the state's 4,600 miles of groomed trails at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet their presence, however limited, is worthwhile, Bacon said. "We're a 
deterrent. The trail system would be absolutely unsafe if we weren't out there 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
 One problem, he says, is that Michigan's punishment is a mere $100 fine. Jail 
time and stiffer fines would be imposed under a proposal before the state 
legislature to treat intoxicated snowmobiling as a form of drunken driving. 
</P>
<P>
 New Hampshire, which had nine fatalities the winter of 1991-92, has a similar 
law and limits trail speed to 45 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "Speed is what sells these new snowmobiles," said Anne Hewitt, of the state's 
fish and game department. 
</P>
<P>
 Snowmobiling clubs supported the speed limit, she said, largely because New 
Hampshire's mountainous terrain and winding trails make high speed impractical. 
That's not the case in Michigan, where Bacon said a speed limit could not be 
enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 In Colorado, "horrified" officials launched a safety education program after 
six people died in snowmobiling accidents last year, said Dave Hause, field 
services chief for the parks department. 
</P>
<P>
 New York in 1992 made drunken snowmobiling punishable by a year in prison or a 
$500 fine. The death toll went from 16 that year to 19 in 1992-93 but is down 
this year, state snowmobiling coordinator Victor Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan's pending crackdown would come too late for Albert Perreault. The 
volunteer firefighter happened upon the scene of last month's deadly crash 
while driving to his cousin's birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
 He discovered that one of the victims was his cousin's 17-year-old daughter, 
and had to break the news to her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was terrible," said Perreault, 48. "You just hope other kids will see what 
can happen and learn their lesson. Unfortunately, it's good for couple of weeks 
and then they forget about it."

PURDUE MIGHT HAVE VIOLATED RULES IN RECRUITING ERICKSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG STANKE and MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nicole Erickson, Brea-Olinda's star guard, could lose at least some 
eligibility to play women's basketball at Purdue if an accusation of an alleged 
NCAA violation by the school, reported by a newspaper Saturday, is true. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lafayette (Ind.) Journal and Courier reported that a scout and a 
recruiting analyst had been contacted as part of an NCAA investigation, "with 
as many as eight possible rule violations drawing scrutiny." 
</P>
<P>
 The report said the Nov. 19 edition of Gold and Black Illustrated, an 
independent publication for Purdue fans, featured a cover photo of Erickson, 
the 1993 Times Orange County player of the year, and fellow recruit Michele Van 
Gorp of Mount Clemens, Mich., wearing Purdue uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 The photograph was taken during Erickson's official visit to Purdue on the 
last weekend in October, before she signed a letter of intent to play for the 
Boilermakers Nov. 10. Van Gorp also signed with Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Mallonee, NCAA director of legislative services, refused to comment on 
any possible investigation of Purdue or answer direct questions concerning the 
photograph of Erickson. He was willing to comment generally on several points: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He said it is a violation to publicize the campus visit of any recruit, or 
to allow pictures of recruits to be taken for any purpose other than use in 
in-house publications. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper report did not say how Gold and Black Illustrated obtained the 
photograph or whether Purdue officials were involved. Calls to Gold and Black 
Illustrated Saturday were answered by a machine. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If a school is found to be in violation of rules during recruiting, 
Mallonee said, the athlete is automatically ineligible pending an NCAA review. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Eligibility Committee can restore eligibility immediately, restore it 
with conditions, or the institution can be told that the student-athlete will 
not be eligible to compete there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 She could, however, play elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson's father, Keith, said Saturday he had not heard of the allegations, 
but knew Nicole and Van Gorp had tried on the uniforms because it was on a 
videotape taken by her mother, Sandy, on the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "They used some of the jerseys that were there," Keith Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My guess is that the things they supposedly broke, I wouldn't think they were 
that serious. It just amazes me how the NCAA will look at little things like 
they were real big things. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hate to see it mess up her first year." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "If they did these things, I don't think they know the rules that 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper said other allegations against Coach Lin Dunn's program include 
improper recruiting, paying extra money to summer camp coaches and arranging 
improper pickup games. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn denied any wrongdoing, and Athletic Director Morgan Burke said neither 
the school nor the Big Ten had yet been notified of an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Charles Verdan, an Amateur Athletic Union director and scout, and Joe 
Smith, a New York recruiting analyst, told the newspaper they had been 
contacted by the NCAA.

FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH STAKES; DEHERE OVERCOMES BAD START TO WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two-year-old champion Dehere came from well off the pace to win the $200,000 
Fountain of Youth Stakes at Gulfstream on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dehere beat Go For Gin by three-quarters of a length, with Ride The Rails 
third. Warm Wayne was fourth and previously unbeaten Holy Bull, the favorite at 
7-5, faded to last in a field of six. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridden by Craig Perret, Dehere ran 1 1/16 miles in 1:44 3/5 and paid $6.80, 
$3.40 and $2.80. Go For Gin paid $2.80 and $2.40. Ride The Rails paid $2.80. 
</P>
<P>
 Dehere carried 119 pounds in this final major prep for the $500,000 Florida 
Derby on March 12. 
</P>
<P>
 This was Perret's first ride on Dehere. The colt's regular rider, Chris 
McCarron, was suspended in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great horse," Perret said. "He didn't like the race track (listed 
as good) at all and still won. He stumbled a little (at the start) and wasn't 
picking it up at all. But when I asked him to run going to the (far) turn he 
really gave me everything he had. He got the job done in spite of everything. 
This is a good horse, with a good head. He's dangerous every time he runs." 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull took the lead at the start, but Halo's Image never gave him any 
breathing room. On the first turn, Holy Bull, on the outside, led Halo's Image 
by a head. Ride The Rails was third, 1 1/2 lengths ahead of Go For Gin. Dehere 
was six lengths farther back. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway down the backstretch, Halo's Image remained within a head of Holy Bull. 
Ride The Rails was two lengths off the lead, with Go For Gin fourth and Dehere 
gaining ground in fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 On the far turn, Halo's Image took the lead and opened a length on Holy Bull. 
Ride The Rails moved up on the rail with Go For Gin alongside. Dehere was 
moving on the outside and took the lead inside the eighth pole. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Croll, owner and trainer of Holy Bull, feared that his horse had bled 
from the lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something had to have happened for him to stop that badly," Croll said. But 
after checking the horse at his barn, Croll said he found no evidence of 
bleeding.

BONNETT WROTE WIFE A LETTER BEFORE DYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After Neil Bonnett died, his widow found in the family safe a letter he wrote 
after longtime friend and fellow NASCAR driver Davey Allison was killed last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Bonnett wouldn't reveal specifics of the letter, but said it "made a lot 
of things OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnett had added more to the letter a few days before leaving for Daytona 
Beach, Fla., to practice for the Daytona 500, she said. He died Feb. 11 after a 
crash while qualifying for the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Bonnett said the letter outlined the things her husband wished he had 
said and done through the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Before she found his letter in the safe Thursday, she wrote a similar letter 
to her late husband and placed it in the breast pocket of the jacket in which 
he was buried. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some things in the two letters that were almost identical," she 
told the Birmingham News. "I believe we both knew something would happen."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; ROOKIE PITCHERS ARE OFF TO GOOD STARTS

 South Korean Park Chan Ho, the Dodgers' new $1.2-million right-hander, 
impressed club officials Saturday when he threw for the first time in the 
batting cages at Vero Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was throwing about 98 miles per hour, and I was somewhere up there above 
that," Orel Hershiser joked. 
</P>
<P>
 Park, 20, threw for about 15 minutes inside the cages after the workout at 
Holman Stadium was rained out for the second consecutive day. He said afterward 
that he was unhappy with his performance, but he was alone in that regard. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has outstanding velocity and great body balance," Manager Tom Lasorda 
said. "He was throwing hard, and he threw some other pitches -- a forkball, a 
breaking ball and his changeup was good. I am very, very impressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Also getting good reviews was rookie Darren Dreifort. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first day of the spring, he threw very well," Mike Piazza said. "His 
release is very smooth and he showed good movement."  
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort and Park are two of 26 pitchers in camp, but talk of them making the 
club this early is premature. "Do they have the ability to pitch at this level? 
Yes they do," said Fred Claire, executive vice president. "When does it happen? 
We'll see." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are six left-handed pitchers in camp: journeymen Gary Wayne, John 
Barfield, Drew Hall and Mike Milchin, and returnees Steve Wilson and Omar Daal.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; NEW SEASON, NEW NUMBER FOR SPRINGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel starter Russ Springer arrived early to the clubhouse Saturday morning in 
Tempe, Ariz., borrowed a magic marker, and methodically began changing the 
number on all of his belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer was told that he has been stripped of his number (40) this year, and 
it instead will be passed along to Frank Tanana.Springer has been relegated to 
No. 43. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I was thinking of dismissing the number anyway," Springer said. 
"All it brought me was bad luck. I don't want anything reminding me of last 
year. The whole year was a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 Springer, who was expected to replace Jim Abbott in the starting rotation, 
instead couldn't even make it out of spring training. He was optioned to 
triple-A Vancouver for the first two months, and things never got much better 
when he returned to the big leagues. He was 1-6 with a 7.62 ERA in his nine 
starts, and his season ended Aug. 1 with a stress fracture in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year's going to be different," Springer said. "I wanted to leave 
everybody with a first impression because everybody knew I was replacing Jim 
Abbott. Instead I left a rotten impression that hasn't gone away. I've got to 
change that." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Shortstop Gary DiSarcina, whose season ended Aug. 26 with a broken thumb, 
arrived to camp early, only to discover the precautions the Angels have taken 
by signing several veteran middle infielders. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the last time I ever get hurt," he said, laughing. "I'm gone awhile 
and they bring in five infielders. Really, I'm fine." BOB NIGHTENGALE

RAFAEL RUELAS RALLIES, WINS THE IBF'S LIGHTWEIGHT TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a test of endurance and punching power, Rafael Ruelas teetered on the brink 
of suffering a first-round knockout before regaining his composure and taking 
the International Boxing Federation lightweight championship away from Freddie 
Pendleton in an unanimous decision at the Forum on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton sent Ruelas to the canvas twice in the first 1:30 of the first round 
-- the first with a sharp overhand right, the second with a left hook to the 
chin -- and Ruelas looked ready to crash for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little cold coming out, not really warmed up that good," Ruelas said. 
"He caught me on the top of the head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew after the knockdowns I had to keep doing what I do best, and that's be 
consistent, keep the pressure on." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruelas went down twice more, in the ninth and 12th, but referee Robert Byrd 
ruled that they were slips, not knockdowns. Pendleton hit the canvas in the 
11th, and that, too, was ruled a slip. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges' scores were 116-111, 115-110 and 114-112. 
</P>
<P>
 By the sixth round, Ruelas (40-1) was controlling Pendleton (35-19-4), and 
Pendleton's nose was bleeding by the ninth. Pendleton later required stitches 
in his tongue.  
</P>
<P>
 But in the ninth, Pendleton landed a right hand, sending Ruelas flying into 
the ropes, in what clearly appeared to be a knockdown. Pendleton attacked 
Ruelas as the round ended, and swung at the dazed Ruelas long after the bell 
sounded. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 12th, with Ruelas dominating, Pendleton jarred him with another right. 
Neither was ruled a knockdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing was going to stop me from going after my dream," Ruelas said. "But if 
feels great now, all the work has paid off." TIM KAWAKAMI

<P>
 To begin the night in Montreal, they stood and cheered Mario Lemieux, a 
hometown boy who had come back to play for the first time in two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 To end the night, they stood and cheered Patrick Roy, the Canadiens' goalie 
who stopped him and the rest of the Pittsburgh Penguins in a 4-1 victory 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy made 26 saves, including six off shots by Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping to have a big game," Roy said. "We owed it to (Coach) Jacques 
Demers because he gave us time off, and then we didn't play that well in Tampa 
Bay this week." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Bellows scored two goals, Vincent Damphousse got another and John 
LeClair scored into an empty net with 36 seconds to play for Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaromir Jagr finally beat Roy at 15:00 of the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadiens were given four days off in Florida, then lost, 4-1, to the 
Lightning on Thursday with Les Kuntar in the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy made the difference against the free-wheeling Penguins.

 Lemieux, who missed 52 games this season because of a chronic back ailment, 
played for the third time in the last five games. The four-time league scoring 
champion made some impressive rushes, but was clearly not at his best. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadiens have won eight of their last 10 games. They moved past 
Pittsburgh into a tie for first place in the tight Northeast Division with idle 
Boston, which has a game in hand.

Weight and Luke Richardson scored for Edmonton, 1-8-2 in its last 11 road 
games.

 Hartford 4, New York Rangers 2 -- Andrew Cassels broke a tie with 34 seconds 
to play at Hartford, then assisted on Pat Verbeek's empty-net goal with six 
seconds left as the Whalers stunned the league-leading Rangers.

<P>
 Hartford snapped a five-game home ice winless streak and won for only the 
fourth time in 17 games (4-11-3).

 New York Islanders 4, Ottawa 0 -- Ron Hextall stopped 37 shots for his second 
shutout of the season and four different scorers helped the Islanders at 
Uniondale, N.Y.

 The victory snapped a three-game winless streak (0-2-1).

PREP BASKETBALL; CRENSHAW, RESEDA GET TOP SEEDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barbara Fiege, the City Section commissioner who took over last October, 
continues to make sweeping changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Her latest project, the basketball playoffs, was announced Saturday as 
Crenshaw and Reseda were named the top-seeded 4-A and 3-A boys' teams, and 
Washington and Jefferson were the top-seeded 4-A and 3-A girls' teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Considered the section's premier event, the playoffs were handled differently 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, the 16-team brackets were set after all regular-season games had 
been completed, reflecting more accurately how teams played at the end of the 
regular season. In the past, brackets were drawn before the season's end, and 
changes often had to be made if there were upsets. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the first time in recent history, City Section coaches had little 
input into the pairings. Fiege's predecessor, Hal Harkness, allowed coaches to 
meet and schedule their brackets. The meetings often dragged and few seemed 
satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, the Division 4-A and 3-A brackets were arranged by a committee of 
Fiege, four coaches and three administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took us about four hours to finish everything, but we encountered 
relatively few problems," said Fiege, formerly the athletic director at 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
 In another change, no team will have home-court advantage throughout the 
playoffs. In the past, the highest-seeded teams played at home. This season, 
home sites will alternate each round. 
</P>
<P>
 The first round begins Wednesday. The championships are scheduled for March 4 
at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the changes in handling the pairings, there were relatively few 
surprises. As expected, the Crenshaw boys, considered one of the state's best 
teams, are top-seeded in 4-A. Westchester, coming off a five-point loss to 
Fairfax on Thursday, is seeded second. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington won a coin flip between Crenshaw and Carson to decide the No. 
1-seeded team in the girls' 4-A. 
</P>
<P>
 In 3-A, Reseda is the top-seeded boys' team and Jefferson the top-seeded 
girls' team. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln's boys, who won the Northwest League, are ineligible for the playoffs 
after twice holding illegal practices during the season.

 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * DAMAGED APARTMENTS: Approved an ordinance requiring landlords of apartments 
damaged in the Northridge earthquake to offer the repaired apartment to the 
previous tenant before offering it to anyone else. Tenants have 45 days from 
passage of the ordinance to notify the landlord of their intent to move back 
in. Once a unit is repaired, the tenant has 30 days to move back. The city 
plans a vigorous campaign to inform renters of the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 * PARK HOURS: Approved a motion that will make it easier for recreation and 
parks commissioners to change the opening and closing hours of city parks. 
Under the motion, changing a park's hours of operation will require only the 
approval of the local City Council member. Previously, such a change required 
approval of the entire City Council. Current operating hours for city parks are 
5 a.m. to 10 p.m. Certain parks considered dangerous now may close earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 * BUSINESS AID: Approved funding for three agencies to provide educational and 
counseling services to businesses in three of the city's economically depressed 
areas. Barrio Planners Inc. is to provide services for the East Side, the 
USC-based Entrepreneurial Institute for South-Central, and Valley Economic 
Development Corp. for Pacoima. Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg contended that the 
Temple-Beverly Corridor, which extends roughly from Downtown to the 
intersection of Beverly Boulevard and Vermont Avenue, was an equally depressed 
area. Councilman Mike Hernandez concurred and the two agreed to draft an 
amendment that would provide funding for an agency to provide similar services 
to businesses in that area. 
</P>
<P>
 * MUSEUM EXPANSION: Approved a plan for the Los Angeles Children's Museum, 310 
N. Main St., to expand from 15,000 square feet to 80,000 square feet. No date 
has been set for the expansion, which will cost an estimated $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * BLACK HISTORY PARADE: Approved the closure of Western Avenue between Slauson 
Avenue and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard on Feb. 27 from 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 
p.m. for the Black History Parade. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 How South-Central and Eastside City Council representatives voted on selected 
issues. * BILL RELIEF: Approved a Department of Water and Power plan to give up 
to $200 credit for combined water and electric bills to customers whose 
residences or small businesses were issued a red tag because of damage from the 
Northridge earthquake. Customers whose residences or businesses were given a 
yellow tag will get a $100 credit. Passed 15-0. Voting yes: Richard Alatorre, 
Mike Hernandez, Mark Ridley-Thomas, Rita Walters, Nate Holden, Jackie Goldberg, 
Rudy Svorinich Jr. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

PRENATAL CARE PROGRAM IS LABOR OF LOVE; RETIRED NURSE HOPES TO EXPAND PROJECT 
TO LOWER BLACK INFANT MORTALITY RATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAMANTHA DUNN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Everything, it seems, is a family affair to Zola Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 30 years, families have been her career. A public health nurse 
since 1961, Jones retired last fall as family planning specialist for Los 
Angeles County's Department of Public Health. But that doesn't mean she has 
stopped working. 
</P>
<P>
 Retirement means she can spend more time on Great Beginnings for Black Babies, 
which she co-founded in 1990. The Crenshaw-based, volunteer-run prenatal care 
campaign is designed to stop the spiraling infant mortality rate among African 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones volunteers most of her time to making Great Beginnings bigger, more 
financially secure and accessible to more women. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to get up at 4:30 a.m. to be at work by 6 a.m. and go for 12 or 14 
hours because I was also trying to get Great Beginnings started," she said. 
"Now I get up a little bit later." 
</P>
<P>
 The 56-year-old woman with a passion for family has never been married and has 
no children. 
</P>
<P>
 She's a favorite aunt, the one who sneaked you extra cookies when Mom wasn't 
looking. Her brown eyes magnified by owl-rimmed glasses, Jones rarely speaks 
first and always says "we did" rather than "I did." She smiles widely and often 
and laughs generously, her shoulders shaking as if she's been seized by a 
sneeze.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've always looked to Zola as the impeccable warrior," said Caswell A. Evans 
Jr., of the county Department of Health Services, in a speech at an 
appreciation dinner recently to honor Jones' decades of work in public health. 
"She is a person with a fire in the belly and a vision in the eye." 
</P>
<P>
 Since her retirement, that vision is sharply focused on one thing: "If 
everything could be right in the world," Jones said, "everybody would have 
prenatal care. There would be no barriers for women to get help, and every baby 
would have the chance to be born healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Many children don't have that chance. California's infant mortality rate 
hovers at nearly 7%, Department of Health Services statistics show, but the 
rate for black babies is more than 16%. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Beginnings, offered in collaboration with Daniel Freeman Memorial 
Hospital in Inglewood, gives pregnant women the information they need to keep 
themselves and their babies healthy. They are taught not to drink, smoke or 
take drugs when pregnant and are given information on nutrition, exercise and 
basic anatomy.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to see Great Beginnings connected with all the major hospitals," 
Jones said from her bare-walled office at the clinic's new Hawthorne facility 
that still has chalky dust and the smell of new carpet in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 County and state health care experts say Great Beginnings has made a 
difference in public awareness. They point to Jones' subtle way of connecting 
the right people as a cornerstone of the program's success. 
</P>
<P>
 "She knows . . . all those things one needs to get a major task done," said 
Great Beginnings co-founder Dr. Virginia Hunt. "She doesn't quit until it is 
finished." 
</P>
<P>
 "Zola has always been at the forefront in maintaining quality care in family 
planning," said Geri Nibbs, a nurse consultant for the state Department of 
Health Services who has known Jones for 15 years. "She has a way of pulling 
people behind her." 
</P>
<P>
 The youngest of eight children, Jones was 12 when her mother died. She was 
raised by her father, who worked in a sawmill near Marion, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 Life wasn't easy for this quiet girl who liked to read. But buoyed by love and 
faith and money from brothers and sisters, extended family, friends, neighbors 
and church, Jones received a nursing diploma from Grady Memorial Hospital 
School of Nursing in Atlanta. Later, she earned bachelor's and master's degrees 
in nursing and public administration from Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 She started nursing in a newborn nursery in a Cleveland hospital because she 
loved the tiny patients. They were cute and they didn't complain, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But after one bitter winter, Jones followed friends west to warmer climes. She 
made her home first in Long Beach and then Hawthorne, devoting her off-duty 
energies to the nursing sorority Chi Eta Phi, the Council of Black Nurses and 
the Nurses Guild at Messiah Baptist Church in the Crenshaw district. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to give something back," she said. "I have always just thought I 
wanted to help." 
</P>
<P>
 "Infant mortality is a major problem throughout the nation," Jones added, "but 
like Martin Luther King said, 'We shall overcome.' "

CRIME VICTIM WAS EYES FOR BLIND YOUTHS; SLAYING: YOUNGSTERS WERE ROBBED OF A 
TREASURED HELPER AFTER VOLUNTEER AMALIA SISON WAS SHOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Amalia C. Sison was one of the Foundation for the Junior Blind's most 
dedicated volunteers. She was one of the very few who arrived early each 
morning by bus to help a small group of children start their day. 
</P>
<P>
 But last Tuesday, the 69-year-old woman was shot through the eye during a 
robbery attempt as she waited behind the Windsor Hills foundation for her 
afternoon bus back to her Central City home. 
</P>
<P>
 Sison died Thursday night at UCLA Medical Center in Westwood. Two boys, ages 
15 and 17 from Inglewood and Santa Monica, were arrested in the shooting. 
Prosecutors filed murder charges against the boys Friday and a deputy district 
attorney said she would seek to try the two as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this has yet registered with the 8- to 16-year-old children Sison 
tended to daily, said Jane McKinnon, principal of the foundation's school. 
</P>
<P>
 It probably never will. 
</P>
<P>
 They only sense that the warm presence of the woman who routinely helped them 
with the smallest chores, who accompanied them on field trips to shopping malls 
and other places, is not there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "She worked with a very difficult population, but she loved the challenge and 
the reward of it," said McKinnon. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a real day-to-day nurturer." 
</P>
<P>
 Sison was one of 18 volunteers working as a foster grandparent at the 
foundation, which serves blind children and young adults and those with 
multiple disabilities. She had worked with McKinnon's school since 1990, and 
four years before that with an adult program until it folded. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinnon said that Sison, a retired dentist and native of the Philippines, 
took particular pleasure in helping feed the children breakfast. She also liked 
to help them with motor coordination and life-skill activities such as getting 
dressed, washing and combing their hair. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinnon said that Sison's dedication was especially appreciated by 
instructors, who frequently had only one other foster grandparent working in 
the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was just a a warm, wonderful person," McKinnon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She helped out in so many ways . . . and it was really appreciated. It makes 
what happened that much more senseless."

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EASTSIDE; 'SANCHO' MARKS 10 YEARS ON THE AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Veronica Barrera and her brother Luis wanted to hear their favorite song, 
"Chorizo Sandwich," and Sancho was happy to oblige. But first, the radio show 
host wanted to make sure they knew the song, and so the pair, who are 6 and 9 
years old respectively, sang the first verse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chorizo, chorizo, chorizo, ooh, ooh, ooh!"  
</P>
<P>
 It's Saturday night and "The Sancho Show" is just one hour into its six-hour 
lineup of oldies, popular Chicano artists and the obscure songs plucked out of 
the 49-year-old broadcaster's collection that he started when he was a 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 Sancho, whose daytime moniker is Daniel Castro, associate dean of student 
activities at East Los Angeles College, has been on the air for 10 years as 
Sancho on KPCC-FM 89.3 Pasadena City College radio. His 320,000 listeners from 
Santa Barbara to San Diego know him for his Chicano humor, unique music 
collection and constant admonishments to stay in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the studio on Valentine's Day, some fans gathered to buy CDs, others 
to request a song for their sweetheart. Inside at the microphone, Castro talked 
about chicharrones, heart-shaped pumpkin-filled empanadas, and dancing with a 
girl named Yolanda at the quinceanera. "I'm sure that people turn in halfway 
through the show and say: 'This guy's whacked out. He's really lost it,' " he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As he queued up Los Lobos' "Volver," Castro talked about the idea behind his 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one's gone after this market," he said, referring to the Chicano 
population that speaks mostly English, a little Spanish and some calo thrown 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came in with the intent that I was going to dig it, even if I didn't know 
if it was going to work," he said of the show, which he thought would last only 
three or four months. "But this was a market that public radio has never gone 
after, and it's now one of the (station's) biggest fund-raisers. People in the 
service, their parents tape the show and send it to them." 
</P>
<P>
 As Sancho, Castro gives Chicano poets, comedians, actors and performers an 
audience and interviews them on the air. He also speaks his mind on events of 
the day, most notably his protests during the Persian Gulf War. "My feeling is: 
I have to do what I think is right." 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago Castro established the Quetzalcoatl Memorial Scholarship Fund, 
named after his 8-year-old son who was killed in a car accident seven months 
after the show started. "Airwaves of Aztlan," a CD he has compiled of local 
Chicano musicians, is one of several projects that raise money for the fund. 
Students have received $250,000 from the fund, Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago Castro founded the annual Chicano Music Awards. Artists such as 
as Vikki Carr, Little Joe, Lalo Guerrero and Eddie Cano have been honored at 
the scholarship fund-raiser. This year's awards will be presented May 21 at the 
Pasadena Civic Auditorium.  
</P>
<P>
 And after last month's Northridge earthquake, he was on the air as Sancho, 
asking his listeners to bring food to the station to make burritos for the 
victims. People from as far as Duarte delivered hundreds of pounds of tortillas 
and beans for his "Burrito Brigade." 
</P>
<P>
 But Castro will not announce events that are not community fund-raisers. Nor 
will he appear at any event that is sponsored by alcohol or tobacco companies. 
"I've never seen anything positive in our community come from alcohol, drugs 
and tobacco," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see myself as a hero. I see myself as a leader and as a teacher," 
Castro said. "I think it's the message that draws people." MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: BOYLE HEIGHTS; MARCH WILL SUPPORT IMMIGRANTS' RIGHTS

<P>
 Immigrant rights activists expect as many as 5,000 people to march on City 
Hall on Saturday to protest proposals that would curb the rights of illegal 
immigrants and what they say is an increasingly hostile climate. 
</P>
<P>
 The march, which will begin at 10 a.m. at Brooklyn Avenue and Indiana Street, 
will culminate in a mock ballot initiative, Proposition One, calling for an 
extension of the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act and a streamlining of 
the naturalization process. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers hope to distribute 26,000 ballots and are urging residents, legal 
or not, to cast their votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way we see it, it's time to stop being the (whipping boys) of Southern 
California," said Juan Jose Gutierrez, director of One Stop Immigration and 
Education Center. One Stop is a private, nonprofit organization that offers 
English and naturalization classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a population that is supposedly monolingual, we're not supposed to be 
doing anything for the economy and we're breaking the treasury of the state by 
using the social services," Gutierrez said. "This is America. We're talking 
about not only people who don't have the legal papers, but the people that have 
been disenfranchised . . . who have no voice, no vote, no nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 A Tuesday night meeting at a One Stop office attracted about 50 organizers 
from throughout the city who promised to distribute the ballots and bring 
people to the march.  
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Congress passed and President Clinton signed an earthquake aid bill 
that restricted illegal immigrants to short-term assistance. Gov. Pete Wilson 
has called for an end to automatic citizenship to children born here of illegal 
immigrants, and to emergency medical care to illegal immigrants at 
state-supported clinics and hospitals. And last year, court decisions forced 
some students who have lived in California for years but who could not show 
residency papers to pay out-of-state tuition at colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of anger," Gutierrez said. "The message has gotten out that one 
vote from an American is far more important than the dignity of an entire 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said the march is the beginning of an intense effort to counter 
some of the proposals limiting the rights of illegal immigrants. And they hope 
it will provide an alternative to some of the anti-immigrant rhetoric that they 
say goes unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get 3,000 or 5,000 people there, this will inspire people to come 
forward and activate themselves," said Alvaro Maldonado, of the Pro-Immigrant 
Mobilization Coalition. "It also sends a message to the racists out there that 
if you are going to attack us, we are going to defend ourselves. It brings 
people into the fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Others see significant change on the horizon because of the numbers of 
immigrants who continue to flow into this country. They say they are 
disillusioned with the political and economic systems that cater to people with 
money and status while immigrants work, pay taxes and get no representation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are starting a very important movement of the government as well as the 
people," said Maria Guardaro, who attended the Tuesday meeting. "To unite the 
people is going to be a big fight. But it makes me very happy because it has 
the potential of a very good ending." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Mauricia Miranda of Vecinos Unidos de Temple-Beaudry: "When we tell the 
politicians about problems, they say: 'Well, this is the system.' Well, let's 
change the system and don't be afraid." MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: LINCOLN HEIGHTS; CULTURAL CENTER GETS A $20,000 GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pacific Telesis has awarded a $20,000 grant to Plaza de la Raza Cultural 
Center to support its School of Performing and Visual Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 The school, established in 1978, enrolls 350 to 600 students a week in dance, 
theater arts and music classes, said executive director Gema Sandoval.The 
students attend classes after school, from 3:30 to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday 
and 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant will help the school continue programs that must be funded through 
private sources, Sandoval said. The city provides 40% of the school's $250,000 
annual operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is absolutely true that what we do is provide a safe haven for children," 
Sandoval said. "We are a latch-key program, without setting out to be, and a 
gang-prevention program, without setting out to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Most students attend classes for free, but those who can afford it pay $35 for 
a 10-week session.

<P>
 The Hollenbeck Youth Center raised $152,000 at a 1,000-person luncheon last 
week and was awarded a $200,000 grant from the city to complete its expansion 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, at 2015 East 1st St., started adding a third story for 
weightlifting areas and offices in 1988, said Mike McClure, program director. 
The project was placed on hold for two years as city money to the center was 
cut.  
</P>
<P>
 With the grant from the city Community Development Department, the youth 
center construction could begin in April and be completed within two months.

 South Gate High School students have been taught that dental appointments and 
colds are no excuse to miss school. Apparently neither is a 6.8 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 3,970-student school reopened one week after last month's devastating 
temblor, 93% of the students reported to class. Within three days the 
attendance rate was 97%, said Jim Alther, the assistant principal who oversees 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 For two consecutive years, South Gate has had the best attendance of the Los 
Angeles Unified School District's 49 senior high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first five months of this school year, the rate was 95.5%, an increase 
of 0.5% over the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1992-93 school year, South Gate's attendance rate was about 95%, 
outdistancing second-place El Camino High School at 87.7%. The districtwide 
average attendance rate is 83%, according to district records. MARY HELEN BERG

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; HOUSING TO OFFER SERVICES TO 
SENIORS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An affordable-housing project expected to break ground this summer will offer 
a home and help to low-income seniors who may need assistance to continue to 
live independently. 
</P>
<P>
 As residents of the $16.4-million project, Rugby Senior Plaza, low-income 
individuals 62 and older will have access to basic medical services, 
transportation services, a daily nutrition program, and other social services 
that will be offered at the site. The property, on Rugby Avenue between Gage 
and Clarendon avenues, is now a public parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "The objective is to deliver additional services over and above housing to 
those of lesser means but greater needs," said Craig Cordial, vice president of 
Marina del Rey-based Cordial Housing Inc., which is developing the project with 
the Bedford Group of Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 About 25% of the project's estimated 200 units would be set aside for 
residents who need daily assistance with housekeeping, laundry and food 
preparation. These services will be available for a fee that will be added to a 
tenant's rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many seniors end up in nursing homes when they don't need to be there," said 
Cordial. "This kind of project provides a middle level and allows them to 'age 
in place.' . . . Instead of moving out of the building to a nursing home, they 
can move from a floor (set aside) for independent living to one for residential 
care." 
</P>
<P>
 Rents will range from about $170 a month for a studio to $549 for a 
two-bedroom apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-story structure will provide four floors of senior housing, one floor 
of parking for tenants and one for public parking. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something we've been trying to do for a couple years," said Bill Chow, 
assistant city planner. "There aren't many empty lots in Huntington Park to 
build affordable housing. We want to provide housing but we don't want to lose 
parking." 
</P>
<P>
 The project is being built with the help of $15.6 million in federal tax 
credits and with low-interest loans from the city, Cordial said. Groundbreaking 
is expected in August. MARY HELEN BERG

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: BELL; JAMES BELL HOUSE RENOVATION IN A FIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some say the James George Bell house is haunted. Others believe the 
118-year-old structure, once a brothel, is occupied by the city's mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 These are myths surrounding the Victorian farmhouse built by the city's 
founder on a 350-acre ranch that is now the heart of Bell. But it's no myth 
that attempts to restore the inside of the home are threatened by a lack of 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historic things are always put on hold when you have a tight fiscal concern," 
said Annette Peretz, director of development services. "We have to take care of 
basics such as police services and infrastructure first." 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to finance $250,000 to restore the landmark's interior to its original 
state, the City Council voted last summer to put restoration plans on hold. 
Officials agree the house's fate may remain in limbo as long as two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Rolf Janssen said the council's decision was based on the fact that 
property-tax revenue is declining and fewer funds are trickling down to Bell 
from Sacramento. Community Development Block Grant funds cannot be tapped 
because the city has not registered the house with the state Office of Historic 
Preservation as a historic building, Peretz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city purchased the house for $18,000 in 1968. Efforts to refurbish it 
began in 1989 when it was moved from Lucille Avenue to the Civic Center. The 
landmark had been taken from its original location at California and Gage 
avenues to Lucille Avenue about 1900. 
</P>
<P>
 The manor now stands at Pine and Gage avenues replete with rebuilt chimneys, a 
reconstructed screened-in porch and a new ramp for disabled visitors. The 
sky-blue exterior, including the original front door and Victorian detailing 
that underwent a recent two-year $150,000 renovation, belie what has become of 
the interior. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning sun shines through exposed redwood lath boards that line interior 
walls and 12-foot-high ceilings. The hardwood floor is dusty and cracked, and 
original wallpaper is peeling from above a large bay window seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Peretz said that the city's plan to recreate the interior's 
turn-of-the-century ambience is ambitious. "We have to replace some of the 
ceiling using redwood that will have to be specifically milled. Everything in 
here is specific," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee at the J. Paul Getty Museum is replicating old wallpaper by 
deciphering old patterns that were pasted over years ago. Workers will 
replaster interior walls instead of using dry-wall materials, Peretz said.  
</P>
<P>
 Light switches and a security alarm system will be hidden by a central 
switchboard that will control the electricity and plumbing, said Lawrence 
Winans, a preservation consultant to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hope to use the downstairs portion of the house, including the 
living, dining and kitchen areas, as a museum. Furniture donated by members of 
the Bell family is in storage, awaiting the renovation's completion. Four 
bedrooms, an attic and a bathroom on the upper floor may be office space for 
the city's Chamber of Commerce or the redevelopment agency, Janssen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Janssen said the home's latest location has restored its significance as a 
landmark: "This house has helped to create a sense of community. We want people 
to understand we are a distinct city that was created by a family with a lot of 
history in Southern California." JENNIFER OLDHAM

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: SOUTH GATE; RESERVOIR MURAL TO PICTURE LOCAL YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 4-million-gallon reservoir scheduled to begin operation in April will have 
a guardian: a mural depicting the spirit of the city's youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Portraits of South Gate Junior High students will dominate artist Jane Boyd's 
colorful mural in a design that city officials hope will deter taggers while 
disguising an obtrusive eight-foot concrete pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 The reservoir, located north of the golf course in South Gate Park, will soon 
be topped with a parking lot. Boyd's mural, 4 1/2 feet high and 22 feet in 
circumference, will partly cover an overflow standpipe that will tower above 
the asphalt near the middle of the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the city invited artists to compete for an opportunity to create 
the first city-sponsored mural and a $5,000 prize, Mosby said. A dozen 
applications were submitted to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd, who teaches English at the junior high, has created murals throughout 
the area, including several in Long Beach and one that appeared in the movie 
"Body Double." She plans to photograph students from her classes and feature 
seven or more individuals in the reservoir mural. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to generate excitement through the use of real people," she said. "I 
want the community to connect, and one of the best ways for the community to 
connect is to use people from the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The face of each student will gaze toward a shining light, and the portraits 
will be interwoven with depictions of fabrics native to Latin America.  
</P>
<P>
 The $5.4-million reservoir will treat and store water from four wells that 
were closed in 1985 because of contamination from PCE, or perchloroethylene, a 
solvent used to remove grease and dirt from metal. 
</P>
<P>
 The overflow standpipe will help filter PCE from the water by allowing vapors 
to escape. Although exposure to high levels of PCE vapor can cause eye 
irritation, lightheadedness, confusion and other maladies, the Air Quality 
Management District has approved the standpipe and has not required the city to 
treat the air that will flow through it, said Public Works Director Jim Biery.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: KOREATOWN; BERENDO INTERVENTION PROGRAM IS ASSESSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAKE DOHERTY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials from the U.S. Department of Justice recently toured Berendo Middle 
School to check on the progress of a program designed to keep youths out of 
trouble and in school. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, funded with a $100,000 federal grant through Community Projects 
for Restoration, pays for a probation officer at Berendo and another at John 
Muir Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 Having a probation officer on campus "gives us an added dimension," said Judi 
O'Sullivan, Berendo's assistant principal in charge of counseling services. "We 
have our own counselors, but they have only so much clout. A probation officer 
can put pressure on parents and students who only listen to us up to a certain 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 With a direct link to the court, a probation officer can compel juvenile 
probationers to attend school and impose sanctions not available to school 
counselors. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Sullivan said there has been a "big change" at Berendo since the program 
began in April, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really been an asset and done a lot for our campus," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the School Crime Suppression Program, probation officers supervise 
students attending school while on court-ordered probation and counsel others 
who are headed for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The program also involves schools that are not covered by the federal grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Eduardo Cordero, Berendo's deputy probation officer, encourages parents to 
take a greater interest in their children's activities and works with several 
community organizations, such as Para Los Ninos, to get families additional 
counseling or assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Students must run a gantlet of trouble every day to and from the school at 
1157 S. Berendo St. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are four gangs and drug dealers within a block of the school in every 
direction," Cordero said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, problems at home make children vulnerable to negative influences 
outside, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a kid is acting out, it's a symptom of family dysfunction." 
</P>
<P>
 The Berendo Family Center, which offers tutoring for students and support 
groups, parenting classes and English classes for parents, is an integral part 
of the school's strategy for crime prevention and intervention, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordero and Annette Smith, the deputy probation officer at Muir, said they 
have noticed a decrease in suspensions and expulsions, improved attendance and 
grades and increased parental participation. 
</P>
<P>
 CPR, a post-riot federal initiative, targets social welfare and law 
enforcement needs in Pico-Union, Koreatown and South-Central through a variety 
of local projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Terree Bowers, a former U.S. attorney and now a special counsel for the 
Justice Department, said federal authorities will soon determine funding levels 
for the local CPR projects, including the Berendo and Muir schools' School 
Crime Suppression programs. JAKE DOHERTY

<P>
 Night falls on the City of Angels. The suits have gone home but lights still 
shine from the high-rise office windows. Inside the towers a nocturnal army is 
on the move. Time for the Big Sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 Mixing the intrigue of a detective mystery with a realistic portrayal of the 
working lives of the city's janitors, a new book offers a glimpse into the 
world of those who sweep while the city sleeps. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Big Sweep" ("La Gran Limpieza"), a Mexican journalist comes to Los 
Angeles to search for her missing boyfriend, a janitor and union activist, who 
disappeared after learning of a union-busting conspiracy. The story unfolds 
through 250 photographs featuring actors and union members with dialogue in 
Spanish and English. The photonovela is the fruit of the efforts of four 
photographers and artists and their interviews with members and organizers of 
the Justice for Janitors campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to weave a story that would address the issues that had come out in 
our interviews in a way that was more fun than a documentary," said Stephen 
Callis, one of the collaborators and a faculty member at the Otis College of 
Art and Design. 
</P>
<P>
 Callis and artist Leslie Ernst launched the project after participating in the 
victorious 1990 campaign to win union recognition, better pay and benefits for 
janitors in Century City. They teamed up with Sandra Ramirez and Ruben Ortiz 
Torres, also artists and photographers, and had the cooperation of the Service 
Employees International Union, Local 399, based in Westlake. A $14,600 grant 
from the Los Angeles City Cultural Affairs Department provided funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Various scenes depict the tensions between overworked janitors and the 
supervisors who hound them, conflicts between the union and the cleaning 
companies and the energy of union rallies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good story about workers and it's good for people who aren't part of 
the union already," said Leonidas Velasquez, a union member and the lead man in 
a janitorial team that cleans a Downtown office tower. "At least with a union 
you have someone to back you up." 
</P>
<P>
 Velasquez said the book's easy-to-read format could be duplicated to assist 
union workers. "A lot of workers make the mistake of not reading their 
contracts and even some union members don't know their rights," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilberto Velasquez (no relation), who lives near MacArthur Park and works as a 
janitor in Westwood, said the story gives readers a taste of how janitors are 
treated by supervisors working for the cleaning companies. But while the book 
focuses on the union's victories, he said he is disappointed that the real-life 
union has yet to gain health benefits for its members working in Westwood or 
resolve many complaints against supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice that the union gets the recognition and it's great to see a book 
that deals with real-life issues," said Jono Shaffer, a union organizer. "To 
use it as an organizing tool, we would have wanted it to have a heavier focus 
on how to organize, how to fight and get out and raise hell. But from the 
standpoint that it shows that we can win, it's good." 
</P>
<P>
 A publication party is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at the Midnight 
Special Bookstore, 1350 3rd St., Santa Monica. JAKE DOHERTY

 Business leaders and preservationists last week celebrated the near-complete 
renovation of a Broadway building that was the only Downtown structure 
destroyed in the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders heralded building owner Walter J. Thomson's decision to 
rebuild rather than demolish as one property owner's commitment to restore the 
Broadway district to its former glory. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomson dedicated the renovated two-story building at 618 S. Broadway in 
memory of his late wife, Holly Felicia Oberly Thomson, and renamed it the 
Victor Dol Building in honor of her grandfather, who bought the land in the 
late 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
 Dol, a French immigrant, was a master chef who became a successful Los Angeles 
restaurateur. The Commercial, Dol's French restaurant near Spring and Temple 
streets, was referred to as the "Delmonico's of the West" because of the 
celebrities, opera stars and politicians who were frequent customers, Thomson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed by architect Charles Plummer, the South Broadway building opened in 
1928 to house the popular Schaber's Cafeteria, which remained there through the 
1940s. Another cafeteria, the Forum, operated there from the 1940s to the 
1980s, Thomson said. For 10 years before the riots, a Foot Locker shoe store 
and a Carl's Jr. restaurant shared the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his father-in-law's history in the area, Thomson, who lives in 
Santa Ynez, said he did not have the heart to demolish the building after 
rioters looted and burned it in the spring of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry demonstrators leaving City Hall on the day of the verdict in the first 
Rodney G. King beating trial smashed cash registers, tables and chairs in the 
restaurant and other property in the building, Thomson said. Looters took 
thousands of dollars' worth of shoes the next night before setting the building 
ablaze, Thomson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire nearly gutted the Spanish Colonial Revival-style structure, leaving 
only the charred facade and the mezzanine standing. Using old photographs and 
Thomson's input, architects and contractors sought to restore the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the decorative wrought-iron railings and brackets were salvaged and 
reused. Unable to duplicate the expensive, Italian-made decorative tile that 
had lined a circular staircase in the building's center, workers used 
solid-colored tile in the same hues -- blue, yellow, green, white, gray and 
black. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomson, who said he has so far spent $2.5 million on the restoration, had 
harsh words for the city building and planning process. He criticized the 
city's requirement that the structure be built to current codes, which he said 
forced him to obtain special permits for nearly every phase of work. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said that current codes aim to improve buildings by requiring 
fire sprinklers, seismic reinforcement and other safety measures. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thomson, who owns another Broadway building and a Spring Street lot, said 
the city bureaucracy curtails property owners who wish to fix up their 
buildings. "It's discouraging to people trying to improve the street," he said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Thomson was clearly pleased with the results. The building is a few 
repairs away from completion, and though Carl's Jr. and Foot Locker won't 
return, the two companies are talking to other businesses about subleasing the 
property, Thomson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This building has been in the family for more than 100 years, and my two 
granddaughters, ages 8 and 11, will eventually get the property," Thomson said. 
"We have more than an academic interest in this." IRIS YOKOI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; CHARGES FILED OVER STORE'S LOUD MUSIC

<P>
 The owner of an electronics store in the Broadway area has been slapped with 
criminal charges for playing loud music through speakers placed on the sidewalk 
last year, a common promotional technique along the shopping strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Lahijaniha, owner of Elegant Electronics Inc. at 218 1/2 W. 5th St., is 
scheduled to appear Thursday in Los Angeles Municipal Court for arraignment on 
one count of disturbing the peace, a misdemeanor.If convicted, the 39-year-old 
Canoga Park man faces up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to neighbors' complaints, police officers reportedly warned 
Lahijaniha repeatedly about playing music too loudly and even ticketed him in 
June and October for violating the city's anti-noise ordinance, said Deputy 
City Atty. Vincent B. Sato. 
</P>
<P>
 Lahijaniha, who owns a second electronics store on Broadway, said this week 
that he has not played music outside his store since two officers removed his 
speakers several months ago. "They said, 'You have very loud music,' and they 
took my speakers, and I said, 'No problem,' " Lahijaniha said. "Now we have no 
speakers out front, no music or noise." 
</P>
<P>
 Lahijaniha said no one ever complained to him personally during his eight 
years of business in the Broadway area. And he speculated that some of the 
complaints police received may have come from competing merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 Sato acknowledged that Lahijaniha's is not the only store to blast music and 
that the sales technique is an area problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "When one store does it, the others do it," Sato said. "We're trying to get 
others to comply. The Police Department has discretion (for enforcement) and 
he, unfortunately, happened to be the first person charged." IRIS YOKOI

<P>
 The proposed Casa Heiwa low-rent apartment complex passed one bureaucratic 
hurdle recently when the Community Redevelopment Agency board gave its nod to a 
financing agreement for the 100-unit project. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit developers, the Little Tokyo Service Center and Pacific Asian 
Consortium in Employment, still must get City Council approval and apply for 
tax credits for the project to go forward. The developers hope to begin 
construction at Third and Los Angeles streets by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Casa Heiwa (a name that combines the Spanish word for "house" with the 
Japanese word for "peace") will provide studios to four-bedroom apartments, 
with monthly rents starting at $300. The four-story building will include 
underground parking, a child care center, a playground, basketball court and 
social services such as job training provided by the Pacific Asian Consortium 
in Employment and other local organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms approved by the CRA board, the nonprofit groups will buy the 1.25 
acres of land from the agency for $2.2 million. The CRA will loan $6.1 million 
to the developers for the $14.5-million project. Terms of the loan have not 
been set. 
</P>
<P>
 The service center plans to raise an additional $5 million to $6 million by 
selling tax credits it receives as a nonprofit entity and by applying for 
conventional loans. Another $4 million will come from the Century Freeway 
housing replacement program created to make up for housing demolished during 
freeway construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The CRA will also spend an estimated $370,000 to find and maintain about 200 
replacement parking spaces for Caltrans workers who are parking on the property 
under an arrangement negotiated when the agency bought the land from Caltrans 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The CRA originally expected to use the site for a hotel and condominium 
development, but economic factors forced the project to be abandoned. In 1991, 
the agency decided to designate the site for affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Project backers hope in particular to draw senior citizens, tenants with 
disabilities and minimum-wage earners. IRIS YOKOI

 Castelar Elementary School has been lauded by the Los Angeles Unified School 
District for having the highest attendance figures last year among the 
district's 420 elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1992-93 school year, Castelar's average percentage of children in 
class was 97%, according to district figures compiled last fall.The district's 
average attendance at elementary schools was 92%. 
</P>
<P>
 Castelar Principal Dore Wong praised her faculty and staff for their efforts 
in getting students to school, but said the parents deserve much of the credit 
for the honor. The school does not offer any particular incentives for perfect 
attendance, so it is really the parents who influence their children, Wong 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Chi Mui agreed. "The parents understand getting their children to 
school is pivotal," said Mui, whose son is a second-grader at Castelar. "They 
get up at 5 or 6 in the morning to get their kids to school." 
</P>
<P>
 Castelar has an enrollment of 1,057. IRIS YOKOI

<P>
 A group of South-Central neighborhood residents and merchants has donated $500 
in computer equipment to the Police Department's Southwest Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping the computer (printer) will provide the officers some equipment 
they vitally need," said George B. Parks, a member of the Committee to Honor 
Capt. Garrett Zimmon, formerly of the Southwest Division.  
</P>
<P>
 The group donated the printer last week. Funds were raised during a January 
event to honor the division. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see this as a way of helping and we also see that if we work with the 
youth on the street by way of the neighborhood approach we can help reduce the 
Police Department's workload," Parks said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: USC; REPAIR PLAN COULD HOLD UP MUSEUM 
</P>

<P>
 State officials say that a $43.5-million plan to correct seismic problems at 
the Howard F. Ahmanson building has not won the approval of two agencies, which 
could delay construction on the California Museum of Science and Industry 
exposition hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't formally seen the plans," said Raymond Girvigian, chairman 
emeritus of the State Historical Building Safety Board, one of the state 
agencies that has yet to review the proposal. "The plans were supposed to go 
through our board for the required mandatory viewing before going on to the 
next step. The project could be held up because it hasn't followed the law." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday the state Public Works Board was scheduled to review plans for a new 
museum that would replace the Ahmanson building. It was closed in 1990 after 
state seismic officials deemed it and the nearby armory unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Nicholas C. Petris, chairman of the Legislature's joint rules 
subcommittee, has said the plan misuses state funds that were allocated to 
correct seismic problems to build a new museum.  
</P>
<P>
 Last week, he reiterated his opposition in a letter to the State Public Works 
board, saying that the two state agencies that have jurisdiction over the 
preservation -- the Office of Historic Preservation and the Historic Building 
Safety Board -- "have opposed the new construction up to this very day and are 
being bypassed." 
</P>
<P>
 State Architect Harry Hallenbeck denied that any state agencies have been 
ignored. "The contention that we have bypassed the board is totally unfounded," 
said Hallenbeck.  
</P>
<P>
 The debate began in December when Petris called for a meeting with the 
museum's board of directors to discuss a design that would demolish the 
Ahmanson but retain its brick and terra-cotta facade. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the building is part of a $350-million master plan to give Exposition 
Park a greener, more accessible look which will include tree-shaded promenades 
and four small community parks. Construction was to start next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Visnich, acting executive officer of the Historic State Capitol 
Commission, also faulted the plan for imposing stricter and more costly seismic 
requirements while failing to preserve the original 1913 building. 
</P>
<P>
 The plans call for Field Act guidelines, stricter seismic codes used in 
schools and educational centers, because about 100,000 students visit the 
museum annually through educational programs. "People had no idea this was 
something other than a retrofitting," said Visnich.  
</P>
<P>
 Museum officials are concerned that the project may be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that came up on us out of the dark," said Bob Campbell, 
deputy director for administration and operations at the California Museum of 
Science and Industry. "Whenever you have an elected official who voices 
concerns, you are at risk, and (Petris) has threatened through his staffer to 
challenge the funding." SANDRA HERNANDEZ

 People Coordinated Services, a senior services center, has received a $110,000 
donation from the Frederick N. Mellinger Alzheimer's Fund to open one of its 
buildings as an adult day-care center for Alzheimer's patients, the first such 
facility to serve the Central City. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the Mellinger Fund presented People Coordinated Services with a 
check last week to refurbish the 1,100-square-foot space at 4708 Crenshaw 
Blvd.The center is also funded by the Alzheimer's Assn. of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 When it opens March 1, the center will serve 23 patients suffering from 
Alzheimer's and other cognitive disorders. The day-care program will operate on 
a sliding-fee scale, but no one will be excluded based on ability to pay, said 
Betty Schlesinger, program director for People Coordinated. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will also conduct family and patient support groups, offer 
community outreach and education forums and self-improvement programs for 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlesinger characterized the new space as a respite center for the primary 
care-givers of Alzheimer's patients, who must supervise their charges round the 
clock. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be social day care, a place where care-givers can get a break 
and patients can help themselves," said Schlesinger. "South and Central Los 
Angeles has needed something like this for a long time."

'WE'RE LIKE THE ELLIS ISLAND OF LOS ANGELES.'; BELMONT HIGH NEAR DOWNTOWN IS 
THE DISTRICT'S MOST OVERCROWDED SCHOOL, AND ONE OF ITS MOST DIVERSE.

 At 12:40 p.m., the race begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of students bolt toward the school cafeteria, forming lines that 
snake around the rows of benches crammed in the busy lunch room. The crush of 
teen-agers waiting anxiously for their meal come from all over the world: 
Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, India, South Korea, Mexico, the Philippines, 
Thailand and Vietnam. Various languages ring through the room as students chat 
with friends and pick up trays of fried chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Belmont High School -- the Los Angeles Unified School District's most 
overcrowded school and also one of its most diverse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're like the Ellis Island of Los Angeles," said Tony Feliz, the school's 
music director. 
</P>
<P>
 About a mile west of Downtown near Beverly Boulevard and Loma Drive, Belmont 
has about 4,200 students -- making it the largest high school in California, as 
well as one of the largest secondary schools in the country. Compounding its 
problems, Belmont's 14.7-acre campus is the smallest for a high school in the 
Los Angeles district. 
</P>
<P>
 Overcrowding is just one of the obstacles students and staff confront daily. 
Because the surrounding Westlake neighborhood consistently attracts immigrants 
from around the world, the school has a steady and heavy flow of students 
hoping to enroll or planning to leave before completing the semester. Many do 
not live with either parent. 
</P>
<P>
 Belmont students represent 50 countries and communicate in more than 30 
languages, and most speak English as a second language. Nearly three-fourths of 
the school's population meet poverty standards qualifying them for free or 
reduced-priced lunches. And the campus is also in one of the city's most 
violent areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Alone, any one of those factors could prove overwhelming. Together, they mean 
unique challenges that Belmont's students, staff and faculty must find 
innovative ways to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only are we the largest school in California, but we're probably the 
largest immigrant entry port for students in California," said Augustine 
Herrera, who is in his first year as principal of Belmont. "Instead of getting 
an education, there's a lot of pressure for students to earn a living and help 
their families survive. We have to make sure school is relevant to students and 
that they consider it a priority." 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera said his staff is now establishing long-range goals for the school, 
which will address such problems as transiency and language differences. The 
school is also looking for new ways to relieve overcrowding, although it is 
already on a multitrack, year-round calendar. Under the multitrack plan, a 
third of the student body is always on vacation, leaving 2,800 students on 
campus at any given time. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next three years, Herrera said, the school will change its curricula 
to cater to its large immigrant population. Although algebra, biology, health, 
world history and career planning classes already are taught in Spanish, the 
school may add more classes in that language to help students with limited 
English skills.

 Belmont's new curricula will not be patterned after educational programs in 
suburban schools because its needs and strengths are different, Herrera said. 
Instead, the school may create more programs such as the International Studies 
Academy, which began in 1989 and is designed for honor students interested in 
learning about different cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we also need to be honest with students who come from other countries 
and are expected to complete all the course work in four years," Herrera said. 
"They need to be told when they come in as freshmen that it's probably going to 
take them more like five years to graduate." 
</P>
<P>
 Belmont opened in 1923 with about 500 students. The main building was rebuilt 
in 1967, and construction on another major addition began in 1990 and is 
expected to be completed in June. The school's mostly white student population 
grew steadily during the 1930s and '40s, but then its attendance started to 
dwindle in the 1950s. The school board considered closing the school, but 
ultimately decided not to. 
</P>
<P>
 About two decades after trustees made that crucial decision, large numbers of 
mostly Latino immigrants flocked to Pico-Union and Westlake to take advantage 
of affordable apartments, and the school began to grow. Today, about 85% of 
Belmont's students are Latino and 13% are Asian. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the massive influx of immigrants, the school board is considering 
constructing another high school in the area. Although some residents and 
community groups are opposed to building a new school so close to an existing 
one, school officials say they must do something to relieve the overcrowding at 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,900 students who live within Belmont's attendance boundaries are bused 
to San Fernando Valley schools because of the overcrowding, while another 600 
students are attending other schools to take advantage of various voluntary 
programs. Area students who normally are bused to El Camino Real High School in 
Woodland Hills, which has been closed since the Jan. 17 earthquake, are not in 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 "Belmont should be the focal point of the community, but it's not," said Vicky 
Castro, a school board member whose district includes Belmont. "That's because 
(so many) kids living in the area are going to other schools. The lack of space 
prevents the school from having any magnet programs, so students have to go to 
other schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with Belmont's multitrack calendar, students face long lunch lines and 
crowded classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "As much as the teachers and staff try to make the best of the situation, you 
can't teach 50 students in one class," said Chris Van, who graduated from 
Belmont last year and is now a freshman at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. ". . . Teachers gave me personal attention because I sought it out, 
but they couldn't give it to everyone because there were too many students in 
each class." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Senior William Estrada said he was forced to come to school during his 
vacation because certain college preparatory classes were not offered on his 
track due to limited space. 
</P>
<P>
 Academically, Belmont lags behind other schools. Its average Scholastic 
Aptitude Test scores are 378 in math and 299 on the verbal portion, compared to 
the district average of 432 math, 355 verbal, and the national average of 478 
math, 424 verbal. Its dropout rate, Herrera estimates, is between 25% and 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 Although large class sizes appear to hinder students academically, Assistant 
Principal Rosa Morley believes the school's low test scores are linked more to 
the fact that so many students speak English as a second language, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to have realistic expectations for our students," she said. "Even 
though their scores are lower, this does not prevent them from achieving. In 
time, they'll catch up." 
</P>
<P>
 History teacher John Lachner said teachers do their best, but have trouble 
juggling jobs as educators and surrogate parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many students live with relatives, or we get into the 'cousin' phenomenon, 
where students live with whoever they include in the broad definition of 
cousin," said Lachner, who also works in the school's attendance office. "This 
requires teachers to spend a lot of time nurturing their students because these 
kids are lost in the shuffle at home." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the school operates as if it has a revolving door also poses 
problems. Although no transiency rate figures are kept, Lachner said he had 
enrolled 20 new students that day and checked out almost as many others. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unbelievable. They come, they go, they go back to El Salvador, they come 
back," he said. "This requires a lot of flexibility on the part of teachers. 
It's impossible for teachers to set a schedule in July because classes change 
so much." 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the students Lachner enrolled came from South Korea and spoke no 
English. They were sent to Feliz's music room after lunch to learn how to play 
the violin. 
</P>
<P>
 "This happens all the time," Feliz said. "But I use the same techniques that a 
teacher would use for students who can't hear. Everything has to be visual." 
</P>
<P>
 Belmont is often considered an underdog when compared to schools in more 
affluent areas, but some students achieve despite the odds, and consider the 
school's diversity extremely beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first when I came to MIT, I felt inferior because a lot of people here 
went to big prep schools, and I came from an inner-city school," Van said. "But 
I found out that although the other students probably have more book knowledge 
than me, Belmont gave me a taste of the real world. The other students here 
aren't as open-minded as me because they haven't been exposed to as many 
different cultures." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Through teamwork and perseverance, the school also has earned a name for 
itself in areas outside the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is particularly proud of its boys' and girls' cross-country teams, 
which respectively have won 11 and five City Section championships. There are 
few individual stars on either team, but Belmont consistently wins the team 
event because so many of its runners place near the top. 
</P>
<P>
 "We run together because we want to make the team look good," said senior 
Yolanda Gomez, who is one of the best runners on the girls' team. "We're like a 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the team's success, few parents watch their children run, 
reflecting the school's general lack of parental involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our parents are busy with jobs that don't allow them to take time off," said 
cross-country coach Alex Carmona. "A lot of our parents, especially parents of 
girls, don't know what cross-country is. They're concerned about their kids 
getting home late, so I often call them and try to convince them that allowing 
their children to run is worth the risk." 
</P>
<P>
 When the school holds a community meeting, usually fewer than 100 parents show 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of our parents are newly arrived immigrants and are not familiar 
with institutions," Morley said. "We try to educate them and involve them in 
the school, but it's difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Gantz, whose son is in the ninth grade at Belmont, believes that could 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Herrera has done everything he could to try and encourage more parents to 
get involved," Gantz said. "He's gone out on the streets and knocked on doors 
to meet as many people as he can. I think this is going to make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Other faculty at the school also have taken steps to turn Belmont around. 
</P>
<P>
 When Feliz arrived at Belmont 11 years ago, the band had 20 members. Today, 
the school's 95-member band and flag corps are major contenders in various 
competitions. Last year, the flag corps took first place in the Southern 
California competition, while the drum line won the same event a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "We compete with schools with tremendous programs," Feliz said. "Our kids were 
flabbergasted when they went to compete and saw parents of other kids grooming 
uniforms and polishing shoes. But we've developed the confidence that winning 
is not out of our reach." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Feliz said he once thought about leaving Belmont because there wasn't enough 
support for the music program. Students still have to share instruments, and 
Feliz is given only $300 a year to purchase new instruments and music. He once 
bought wooden sticks at Builders Emporium because he couldn't afford to buy 
real drumsticks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy at another school asked me to take over his program," he said. "He 
said, 'Tony, get out of there. There's nothing you can do for those kids. 
They're not going to support a band over there.' After that, I decided to stay 
because it made me really mad." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Feliz has grown attached to the school, his job is never easy. Last 
fall -- two weeks before the band was about to enter a regional competition -- 
someone broke into the school and stole $25,000 worth of instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was devastating," Feliz said. "But some of the kids wanted to perform 
without instruments. They just wanted to march." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the school managed to replace the instruments with money from its 
general fund, crime remains a constant threat to everyone at Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is in the Los Angeles Police Department's Rampart Division, which 
last year reported 119 homicides, 109 rapes, 3,749 robberies and 3,968 
aggravated assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada said he once was robbed at knifepoint on his way home from school. The 
17-year-old, however, is nonchalant about the incident and continues to walk to 
and from school. "You just have to watch out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 60 gangs have been identified in the area surrounding Belmont, but 
school police Officer Hector Longoria said gang activity is kept off campus. In 
the nearly two years since Longoria has been at the school, there have been no 
shootings and only a few weapons found on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students, teachers and other staff members here work as a team," Longoria 
said. "Although there is a lot of crime in the area, inside the school is the 
safest place to be." 
</P>
<P>
 To keep order on campus, administrators rely on a strict set of rules. Last 
semester, the school implemented a policy to crack down on students who come 
late to class. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents are called the first time a student shows up late. Notices are sent 
home after the second time. Students are suspended after the third and fourth 
late arrival, and are transferred to another school if they come to class late 
five times. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to have a lot of tardies and people would always be walking through 
the halls during class," Morley said. "Now, we catch them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We make our rules clear to students from the start. During orientation, we 
tell them that we don't allow gang attire or fights. We're so crowded that 
students know if we transfer them, there's 10 other students waiting to come 
in. They know it's a privilege for them to be here." On the Cover 
</P>
<P>
 Students are packed into hallways between periods at Belmont High School. In 
addition to overcrowding, administrators and teachers must cope with a high 
transiency rate, a student population that is largely poverty-stricken and 
youths who speak many different languages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering the obstacles we face, I think that the staff here does a heck of 
a job," history teacher John Lachner said. "I find this job extremely enjoyable 
80% of the time, and very difficult 20% of the time."

CITY ARTS; THEIR RAP IS ORIGINAL

<P>
 Long before there was Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Run D.M.C. or even Grandmaster Flash, 
there were the Watts Prophets. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio, an outgrowth of the Watts Writers Workshops formed in 1970 in the 
wake of the 1965 Watts riots, was the first group on the West Coast to perform 
spoken words over jazz and other rhythm tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't call it rap then, although we kind of invented the phrase in 1970 
with our album, 'Rappin' Black in a White World,' " said Otis O'Solomon, whose 
fellow Prophets are Richard Dedeaux and Anthony (Amde) Hamilton. "The style, 
the words, just came out of what we felt at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Laced throughout the Prophets' stories and intricate rhythms is social 
commentary that is at the heart of their work -- everything from police 
brutality to ecology to drug and alcohol abuse serve as tableaux for their 
be-bop-style wordplay. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the missing link between jazz beatnik poetry and hip-hop rap," said 
publicist Dave Lumian. 
</P>
<P>
 The Prophets, performing today at the Central Library, have recorded with 
artists including Don Cherry, Horace Tapscott, Ornette Coleman, Stevie Wonder, 
Quincy Jones and Billy Higgins. They have amassed a new following among the 
hip-hop generation -- releases by rappers such as D.J. Quik and Eazy-E 
generously sample Prophets' cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Watts Prophets perform today, 3 p.m., in the Mark Taper Auditorium at the 
Central Library, 630 W. 5th St.; free; (213) 228-7555.

VOICES: RACISM TAKES A VACATION; REGULAR FIELD TRIPS HELP ASIAN, BLACK AND 
LATINO PRETEENS UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER'S CULTURES 
</P>

 Virginia Taylor Hughes is the founder of the Slauson Western Youth Enrichment 
Program (SWIPE). The nonprofit organization aims to foster friendships among 
children to reduce racial tensions in urban areas. Hughes, a 48-year-old mother 
of six and grandmother of 22, was interviewed by Karen E. Klein.  
</P>
<P>
 I knew we needed to reduce racial tension in this city since the riots, and I 
thought I should be doing something to help. I met with the leaders of three 
racial groups for an extended period of time and I was not satisfied with our 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I realized it is the kids who are going to make a difference. We adults 
are the idiots who teach racism and prejudice. I thought if I worked with kids 
and they learned something about each other's cultures and some history they 
would discover that they are so much alike. And hopefully they'll be better 
prepared to work together when they're adults. 
</P>
<P>
 I've got about 60 kids, ages 8 to 12, who are participating in field trips we 
take together on Saturdays. Since July 1, we've been to two libraries, the 
Hollywood Bowl, the circus, Knott's Berry Farm, Koreatown, East Los Angeles and 
next we're taking a tour of South-Central. We've all learned some Korean and 
Spanish words, and now we're going to get them all talking a little bit of 
ghetto-ese. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents think it's a wonderful idea; they've been very supportive. I have 
a waiting list of up to 30 kids who want to go on the field trips, but I can't 
handle any more until I get more volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a rule that the kids have to join up with someone from a different 
group for the day; they can't just sit and talk to the kids from their own 
racial group. And the adult volunteers are all different races too, so the kids 
learn they have to respect everybody no matter what they look like. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been interesting the reactions we've gotten on the different trips. When 
we ate in a Mexican restaurant in East L.A., the black kids and the Hispanic 
kids were having a great time. The Asian kids did not like the food at all. 
Then, when we were in a Korean restaurant, the little black kids were going, 
"Where's the gravy for my rice?" "Where's the shrimp fried rice?" We all got to 
learn what Korean food is like. 
</P>
<P>
 I started the tutoring program at Western Avenue Elementary after I got very 
frustrated on a field trip one day. I heard a black little girl ask an Asian 
little girl, "Do you know what is (rapper) Ice Cube?" The little Asian girl 
started off on a long explanation about H2 O and the chemical components of 
ice. The black girl looked at her and said, "You so dumb," and walked away. 
When I asked her later what she took out of her mama's freezer to make her 
drink cold, she said, "A ice." 
</P>
<P>
 I said to myself, "Oh, no. I got work to do. These kids are not relating on 
the same level." I found out that the Asian kids study for more hours after 
school each day and they go to Asian schools on the weekend and get tutoring on 
Saturdays for English. I realized the black and Hispanic children needed some 
additional help. 
</P>
<P>
 We have about 15 to 20 kids at Western Avenue that we tutor after school every 
day from 2:30 to about 4:15, helping them with their homework. All my tutors 
volunteer their time. They're mostly retired people who are parents themselves 
or my neighbors or friends of friends. I'd like to extend the tutoring to 5:15 
if I had more volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids are just wonderful. I call them my little flowers -- not to their 
faces, of course. I was born in East L.A. and grew up in South-Central and if I 
had gone to public schools I would have attended Western Avenue Elementary. 
Also, my family's furniture business is right across the street from the 
school, so it seemed like a logical place to start. 
</P>
<P>
 I have five board members and about 20 adult volunteers, all putting in their 
own time. We've just gotten our nonprofit status so now I'm going to do some 
fund raising so we can expand. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. Slauson Swap Meet donates office space, and a lot of the children of 
the merchants are in the group. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope that even if these kids have learned racism at home, the experiences 
they have with our group will give them a different perspective. If no one 
takes the time to learn about other cultures, nothing's ever going to get 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 The best part for me is when I see the Asian kids and the black kids 
exchanging telephone numbers at the end of the day, and the little girls, who 
are really timid in the morning, holding hands and sitting next to each other. 
That's my reward.

'SOME JUSTICE IS BEING DONE'; A WOMAN REMINISCES ABOUT HER MOTHER, WHOSE MURDER 
19 YEARS AGO MAY SOON BE SOLVED THROUGH A NEW FINGERPRINTING TECHNIQUE.

 Evelyn Irwin's mother, 84-year-old Mamie Johnston, was stabbed to death in her 
Los Angeles home in 1975, a slaying that was still unsolved last year when 
Irwin read about a new computer system purchased by the Los Angeles Police 
Department that can identify fingerprints in some old cases. The system is able 
to search through thousands, sometimes hundreds of thousands, of fingerprints 
on file to match a latent print at a crime scene with the prints of a suspect. 
Irwin called police, prompting an investigation that led to the arrest of a 
woman who was 16 and lived across the street from Johnston at the time of the 
murder. The woman is in custody pending a hearing next month on whether she can 
be tried as an adult for the crime. Police are investigating the possible role 
of an accomplice. Irwin, who lives in Los Angeles, was interviewed by Mike 
Wyma.  
</P>
<P>
 When all of this began to happen there were a lot of feelings of maybe I 
shouldn't have brought it up, maybe I just don't want to go through all this 
again. But now I'm glad I did it. Knowing my mother, I think she would be 
pleased I did this and some justice is being done. 
</P>
<P>
 I now feel that whoever did this should be punished. When it first happened we 
had absolutely no idea who it was. Even though detectives talked to everyone in 
the neighborhood, including this girl, we had no leads at all. There are so 
many things like this that happen to older women and are never solved that I 
guess I just accepted that it was a situation that would never be solved. 
</P>
<P>
 I had some very strong guilt feelings that I had not forced my mother to move. 
I wanted her to move. Many, many times I asked her to. She was living alone. 
She couldn't take care of the yard anymore. I thought she might be happier in a 
condo or something. But that was her home for 52 years, and my aunt Edna lived 
next door. My father built both of those houses at that development when it 
opened up.  
</P>
<P>
 I thought, if only I had gone out and rented her a condo or rented her an 
apartment and packed her and moved her physically. But my husband said that's 
ridiculous. She didn't want to move, and it was her right to stay there. When I 
started to think about that, I didn't feel so bad. 
</P>
<P>
 She always said she couldn't move because Edna didn't want to move. There were 
just the two sisters, and Mother was the strong one. Mother was the extrovert 
and Edna was the introvert. Mother was my grandfather's "boy" and she helped 
him with his bookkeeping and business, and Edna was my grandmother's girl. 
</P>
<P>
 My aunt suffered. She lived three more years but she just couldn't cope. I 
brought her home and she was here for a couple of months. But I was working and 
she was alone. She used to walk the house, back and forth, asking "Where's 
Mamie? When's Mamie coming back?" She wouldn't eat. We found a senior home for 
her but she couldn't adjust. Three nights a week my husband, Woody, and I would 
stop on our way home to see her. I don't think she knew we were really there. 
</P>
<P>
 I was an only child, and the fact that my grandmother and my grandfather, who 
were my mother's parents, and my aunt lived next door meant I had a very close 
relationship with my family. My mother and I used to do things together. The 
big event -- I lived on 84th Place and Vermont and there was a street car on 
Vermont -- the big event was to get on the street car and go Downtown, down to 
the Broadway. The store was at 4th and Broadway; the May Co. was on 8th and 
Broadway. We would window shop and just browse. There was never a lot of money 
to buy a lot. But we would just have a big day, have lunch at Clifton's 
Cafeteria. I loved that. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother was a librarian. She did all of the library work for the city 
schools. When she got married she quit, then later she decided that our little 
Vermont-Manchester area needed a library, so she talked the Better Business 
Bureau and the Kiwanis Club and all these community groups into sponsoring a 
library. And she ran the library, probably from the very early '30s till the 
early '40s. All during my high school and junior high years. 
</P>
<P>
 She had many children's books. I remember sitting in my little rocking chair, 
which I still have, incidentally, in front of the fireplace. We didn't have a 
heater or a forced-air furnace. It was a little California bungalow. I can 
remember my dad sitting in his big chair reading his magazine, Field and 
Stream, and a newspaper, and Mother reading to me. I have some wonderful old 
children's books. 
</P>
<P>
 Memories come back when situations trigger them. Something would arise that 
made me think of mother. I would sometimes dream about it at night. And I 
always felt her death was a very unfair thing. She was 84 years old and I could 
accept that she died. But I could never accept the manner in which she died. 
</P>
<P>
 I always hoped and I finally decided that during it her mind just snapped. 
That she went into a shock from fear, that she didn't know what was happening 
to her. I've decided that was the way it was because that would have been less 
traumatic for her and less painful for her. Just not to know what was 
happening. 
</P>
<P>
 I did not go to a therapist. I did not go for counseling. The only counseling, 
if you can call it that, I got was from my husband. 
</P>
<P>
 The good that has come out of it is my feeling of greater support for the 
Police Department. I have always supported the police but I cannot say enough 
good for these detectives. They dug out the files from the archives and pursued 
this immediately, and they stayed with it and worked very diligently. I think 
they're wonderful.

 In a Jan. 23 story headlined "LA awaits discovery by rerouted suburbanites," 
the Boston Globe reported on the reactions of motorists who have been diverted 
through South-Central Los Angeles because of the collapse of sections of the 
Santa Monica Freeway. The Globe story said: 
</P>
<P>
 "In the coming year, tens of thousands of commuters are expected for the first 
time to cut through Southwest and South-Central Los Angeles to avoid repairs on 
quake-damaged freeways.They will take official detours and unfamiliar side 
streets through these predominantly minority communities, forcing them to see 
for themselves what had tended to frighten many from afar. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'The freeways allowed people to ride above the fray, but people are going to 
find out where South-Central is now,' said Melvin Oliver, a sociology professor 
at UCLA's Center for the Study of Urban Poverty. 'People are going to make that 
daily commute and it may help people discover that, for all its faults, 
South-Central is a place where people work, live and go about their business 
like anywhere else.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 1, USA Today reported that for South-Central residents, "the 
Northridge earthquake is another reminder of how forgotten they feel." The 
article continued: 
</P>
<P>
 "After the quake, residents complained they were being ignored. There were 
charges relief centers were slow to open. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'If you walk through Crenshaw and down Adams, you can see damage for miles,' 
says Cedric Watkins, 38, an insurance broker. 'It's not being reported by the 
media, and . . . race has something to do with it.' "

POTTER EXHIBIT LEAPS BEYOND PETER RABBIT; LITERATURE: DISPLAY AT NATURAL 
HISTORY MUSEUM SHOWS SHE WAS NOT ONLY AN AUTHOR AND ARTIST, BUT ALSO A 
DEDICATED CONSERVATIONIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It is writer Alison Lurie's contention in "Don't Tell the Grown-Ups" that many 
of the best-loved books of childhood are paeans to misbehavior. 
</P>
<P>
 The stories youngsters read when no adult is looming over them are filled with 
acts of rebellion, committed by small creatures who manage to escape all but 
the most trivial of the dire consequences their elders insist will befall them. 
Children love the literature of subversion, Lurie argues persuasively. 
</P>
<P>
 Few books fit as neatly into Lurie's paradigm as those of Beatrix Potter, 
whose world is the subject of an exhibit opening March 1 at the county Natural 
History Museum in Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit, "Through the Garden Gate: The World of Beatrix Potter," includes 
enlarged story boards of Potter's first and favorite story, "The Tale of Peter 
Rabbit," first editions of her distinctive small-format books, family 
photographs, more than 40 of her meticulous watercolors of fungi and an 
original painting of one of the world's best known frogs, Jeremy Fisher, in his 
lily pond. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors will enter the exhibit area through a Victorian trellis. Inside, 
there's a tunnel small children can crawl through just as an adventuresome 
bunny might. There is also a computer featuring a game in which players try to 
decipher phrases written in the secret code Potter invented when she was 14 and 
used for the journal she kept until she was 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The show was organized last year by the Cleveland Museum of Natural History to 
mark 100 years of Peter Rabbit. Peter first appeared in 1893 as the rebellious 
protagonist of an illustrated letter Potter wrote to cheer up the ailing 
5-year-old son of her former governess. In 1900, Potter borrowed the letter 
back, expanded it into a book with a drawing for every page and sent it to six 
publishers. All of them rejected it. A major stumbling block was the pint-sized 
format Potter insisted on. The book had to be small enough to accommodate 
little hands and to be carried easily to the places children go, including to 
bed. In 1901, she finally had 250 copies of "The Tale of Peter Rabbit" printed 
at her own expense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cleveland Museum's Laura Lee Martin said the same question kept popping up 
when the museum announced it planned to do a Potter show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Didn't she just write children's books?" people asked. Martin was indignant 
at the thought. "Potter was infinitely more than just a spinster who dabbled in 
picture books," said Martin, who cites Potter's lesser-known achievements as an 
amateur scientist and pioneering conservationist. And Potter married at 47, 
after which time she concentrated on raising sheep rather than writing books. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-taught naturalist, Potter as a child began sketching whatever scurried 
or bloomed, and was soon dissecting mice, owls and foxes, then boiling their 
skeletons and reassembling them. A lover of mushrooms as well as ducks and 
hedgehogs, she was the first person in Great Britain to propagate certain 
fungi. She also theorized, correctly, that lichens represent the marriage of a 
fungus and an alga. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The exhibit presents the three Beatrix Potters in their own words and with 
their own images," says Martin. "The young artist, who began painting as a 
lonely child. The woman who saw publishing children's books as a way to achieve 
financial independence from her rigid parents. And the conservationist, who, 
before her death in 1943, managed to protect more than 4,000 acres of Britain's 
fragile Lake District from development." 
</P>
<P>
 Once Potter found a publisher, she became a phenomenon. In 1902, Frederick 
Warne & Co. published 8,000 copies of "The Tale of Peter Rabbit" with 
watercolor illustrations. It had sold 50,000 copies by the end of 1903. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Cart, a Los Angeles-based expert on children's literature, attributes 
Potter's remarkable success to her genius and to the fact that she was the 
first English writer/illustrator to create books for preschoolers. But Cart 
also thinks clever marketing has fueled almost a century of Pottermania. "Peter 
Rabbit was probably the first so-called licensed character in children's 
literature," said Cart. Potter put her imprimatur on dolls, wallpaper and even 
bedroom slippers based on her characters. 
</P>
<P>
 But savvy marketing isn't everything. Something deeper and darker explains why 
children grow quiet time after time as they hear how Peter outwits Mr. McGregor 
and pays no greater price than having to swallow a dose of chamomile tea. 
Potter never patronizes her young readers. She always includes a difficult word 
in her stories. And her work is underpinned by her vast knowledge of nature. 
Nature is sometimes cruel in her stories, but it rings true, as do her 
illustrations.

BIG GAME IS FANS' DREAM, SECURITY NIGHTMARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 500 fans filled the Quonset hut-shaped gym at Dorsey High School, 
forcing school officials to close the doors 40 minutes before the start of a 
Friday afternoon basketball game between Dorsey and Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "No more room," a school policeman informed 300 other fans outside. Even 
Marques Johnson, former NBA star and father of Crenshaw forward Kris Johnson, 
had to talk his way past security. And he played basketball at Dorsey for a 
year before transferring to Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that evening in East Los Angeles, about twice as many fans turned out to 
see Cathedral play at Salesian in a game that matched two teams that had a 
combined record of five wins and 30 losses. The doors had to be closed an hour 
before the 7:30 tip-off. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? It's the Big Game. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivalries can be a time when a team with the worst of records can be motivated 
to play its best. They unite communities, attract crowds and rekindle 
friendships between former competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 But they can be a scheduling and security nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year Cathedral and Salesian played an important Santa Fe League football 
game to empty stands at Piux X High in Downey. The game was moved to a neutral 
site and played on a Thursday because of administrators' concerns about 
possible violence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation was getting hot, really hot," said Jerry Scott, Salesian 
football coach. "Guns were involved (in incidents leading up to the game). 
That's why the administration stepped in before anyone got hurt. If one student 
got hurt, it would have been a death warrant for that school." 
</P>
<P>
 Cathedral, located between Elysian Park and Chinatown, and Salesian, which is 
in Boyle Heights, have been rivals since the mid-'80s, when the two Roman 
Catholic all-boys schools became members of the Santa Fe League. Both attracted 
students from the same elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The rivalry became so intense last year that school officials banned fans from 
sporting contests between the two schools for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole reason for playing a closed football game was to play a safe game 
with no incidents, so no players or students would get hurt," Scott said. "The 
problem is with the young alumni, guys who graduated two or three years ago who 
don't want to let go of those high school years." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from both schools kept last year's game site secret from news media, 
students and fans. Only coaches, players and officials attended the game, which 
Cathedral won, 13-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban was to last until next January, but media and community pressure 
forced the schools to admit fans to the games, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Salesian, which has separate bleachers for opposing fans, played host to both 
basketball games this season. Increased security and a bigger faculty presence 
kept the games incident-free. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the rivalries are very healthy and have gone on for so long that 
parents and their children often attend the same high school, and the tradition 
is carried on from one generation to another," said Barbara Fiege, City 
athletic commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 "The forefront is the Garfield-Roosevelt (football game). It's a 
family-oriented game where people are not afraid to bring their little kids." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That matchup has become the area's biggest football game and a model for other 
rivalries. In the 58th meeting between the two last year, the game, now called 
the East Los Angeles Classic, drew an overflow crowd of 25,000 to East Los 
Angeles College's Weingart Stadium. Officials hope to move the Classic to the 
Rose Bowl next season to accommodate a bigger crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes games between rivals exciting yet dangerous? 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids competing against each other from the same neighborhood," said Robert 
Garrett, Crenshaw football coach. "They played Little League together, they 
went to the same junior high. That is what makes a game a rivalry." 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw-Dorsey games are among the City's most exciting and competitive, 
whether football, basketball or track.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't ever have to emphasize the importance of the Crenshaw game," said 
Paul Knox, Dorsey football coach. "They see these players daily and they know 
who will be talking and boasting if they are victorious." 
</P>
<P>
 "We only have problems with outsiders and the non-participants," Garrett said. 
"The kids never have been a problem on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Gunfire erupted during the closing minutes of a 1991 football game between the 
two schools; two students were wounded by bullets that ricocheted across the 
field. Two years earlier, a game was interrupted by gunfire outside Jackie 
Robinson Stadium; no injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District has $55,000 set aside in its current 
athletic budget to pay for additional security at such "critical games," Fiege 
said. The fund covers all sports, but mainly is used for football and 
basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year has been a very quiet year for the City in comparison to a few 
others," she said. "I think it's a credit to the individual schools and their 
administrators. There is more communication between schools, and administrators 
are taking care of things before they happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The best rivalries require teams of equal ability -- but that is not always 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Randy Rodriguez, Lincoln football coach: "When one school actually loses 
a lot and the other team is having a winning season, it can get ugly . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers have had the upper hand lately against cross-town rival Wilson in 
football, but are still trying to avenge the clobberings they endured in the 
'70s. The worst took place in 1977, when Wilson held a 63-0 halftime lead. The 
Tiger team, reduced to 20 players because of injuries, boarded a bus and left 
before the start of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still get haunted by that," said Rodriguez, who was a Lincoln assistant in 
1977. "We had a bunch of great kids on the team. I have that team picture in my 
office as a reminder. If we ever get beat that bad again, it's time to get 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 And other rivalries are downright personal, like the Bell Gardens-Montebello 
basketball games. The Lancers' Charlie LaCommare has coached against younger 
brother Dennis 10 times in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Charlie: "I've never lost to him yet."

GAME OF THE WEEK; LANCERS ADVANCE-- ONLY ONE ROUND; BASKETBALL: BELL GARDENS 
WINS ITS FIRST PLAYOFF GAME IN FOUR YEARS. BUT A SECOND-ROUND DEFEAT LEAVES 
LITTLE TIME TO SAVOR THE VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 History didn't repeat itself Tuesday night. And Bell Gardens Coach Charlie 
LaCommare couldn't have been happier. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers had lost in the Southern Section first-round basketball playoffs 
each of the past three years to Lakewood. But LaCommare's squad finally put an 
end to the school's postseason frustration, by pounding Eisenhower of Rialto, 
72-50, in a Division I-AA game at Bell Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're a freshman player and see the varsity lose in the first round and 
the same thing happens in your sophomore and junior years, it's kind of obvious 
what has happened," LaCommare said. "I'm sure the losses were on their minds, 
but I didn't say a word about it to them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers' presence in the playoffs, however, was cut short Friday night by 
second-seeded Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early going Tuesday night against the Citrus Belt League's third-place 
entrant, Bell Gardens' fortunes did not appear much brighter than postseasons 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 The Almont League champion Lancers did not score until the 4-minute, 10-second 
mark of the first quarter and trailed, 21-12, with 5:26 remaining in the 
second.  
</P>
<P>
 That's when Bell Gardens went to a full-court press. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers outscored Eisenhower, 13-2, to take its first lead with 47 seconds 
left in the first half with a layup by Dan Escobar. 
</P>
<P>
 "We applied the pressure and they couldn't handle it," said Escobar, who had 
eight points during the spurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Gardens opened the second half with 12 points in the first 1:51 to build 
a 41-29 advantage. Eisenhower never got closer than nine points thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers held the Eagles without a field goal for the first six minutes of 
the fourth quarter, stretching their lead to 66-44 with 2:29 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the start, we were a little intimidated of (Eisenhower) because we saw how 
high they were jumping," Escobar said. "We told ourselves that we couldn't be 
scared of anybody and I think we surprised ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is CIF and these are the playoffs. You're not supposed to win by this 
much. You're supposed to get by by only a few points."  
</P>
<P>
 Escobar, a 6-foot-1 senior forward, finished with 21 points and had eight 
rebounds. George Gutierrez and Robert Zaragoza scored 13 and 12 points 
respectively, and Pete Loza added 11 points and eight assists for Bell Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar scored 15 points Friday night against Los Alamitos, but the Lancers 
fell to the second-seeded Griffins, 74-53, in the second round on the road. Los 
Alamitos was led by Tim Lin's 25 points.

SOCCER ROUNDUP; MONROE KICKS LOS ANGELES OUT OF THE PLAYOFFS

 Monroe came back from a 1-0 first-half deficit and scored twice in the second 
half to eliminate Los Angeles, 2-1, Thursday in the first round of the City 
Section playoffs. The Romans were one of 11 area schools to qualify for the 
32-team playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Romans (8-2-1) showered their opponent's net with 12 shots on goal in the 
first half, but scored once in the 27th minute. Fourteen-year-old freshman 
Brook Berhanu made a one-touch tap into the Vikings' net from one yard out off 
a perfect pass from Miguel Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 But Monroe (5-2-3), last year's City Section finalist, rebounded early in the 
second half. The winning goal came three minutes after the equalizer when 
Wilson Lopez banged the ball in at close range off a corner kick pass.  
</P>
<P>
 In other Friday playoff action: 
</P>
<P>
 Bell 9, Marshall 1 -- Oswaldo Williams scored five times as the top-seeded 
Eagles (9-0-1) showed no mercy to Marshall (1-6-2). Locke 2, Venice 1 -- 
Striker Ricardo Chavez scored the winning shot on a personal play as the Saints 
(5-3-1) upsetVenice (4-3-2) at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson 1, Birmingham 0 -- Mules goalkeeper Jose Manuel Garcia made two saves 
during a penalty kick shootout, setting up the winning goal by Enrique Arias. 
San Pedro 1, Jefferson 0 -- The second-seeded Pirates (9-0-1) had a tough time 
holding on to their lead. Forward Michael Di Massa scored the winning goal on a 
diagonal volley from 15 yards out. Jefferson (5-3-1) outshot the Pirates 12-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth 2, Lincoln 1 -- The Chancellors (7-2) stripped the Tigers (3-5-1) 
from a 1-0 lead with 15 minutes remaining. Hector Umana scored for Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate 3, San Fernando 2 -- Gilbert Mira scored the winning goal with 
three minutes to go. The Rams (4-5-1) had an early 2-0 lead with goals by Eric 
Salazar and Freddy Campos. 
</P>
<P>
 Garfield 1, Banning 0 -- Danny Aguilar scored the winner with 10 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood 3, Dorsey 1 -- With the game tied at 1 at the half, the 
Huskies (4-4-2) tallied twice in the second half to upset the Dons (4-3-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Because of rain, most Thursday first-round City Section playoff boys' matches 
were postponed. GIRLS' PLAYOFFS 
</P>
<P>
 The playoffs begin Tuesday. Of the six area schools fielding teams, Bell, 
Garfield and Fremont advanced to the first round. Bell (7-0-1) faces Hamilton 
(4-5); Garfield (6-1-1) is paired with Westchester (3-3-2); and Fremont (4-2) 
plays Palisades (8-0). 
</P>
<P>
 The four top seeds in the girls' playoffs -- Chatsworth (8-0), San Pedro 
(8-0), Grant (5-1-2) and Granada Hills (5-1-1) -- will have a bye Tuesday and 
play quarterfinal matches Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Semifinal matches will be March 2.

 Until recently, Eddie Gage and many of his friends walked around Orange County 
with do-it-yourself haircuts. Their only other choice was to drive to Long 
Beach to find a barber. 
</P>
<P>
 African Americans like Gage who seek services here find that few are offered. 
And products from black literature to Southern-style barbecue are lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 Gage, a 33-year-old private investigator who owns a business in Fullerton, 
said he usually goes to Los Angeles for shopping, dining and entertainment. "In 
black Orange County, that's common practice. That's what everybody does," he 
said. "It's part of the culture shock when you move to this area." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Orange County shops that cater to African Americans are 
having trouble staying afloat. Gone are many businesses that thrived during the 
1970s and early '80s in Santa Ana. Within the past year, the original Burrell's 
Barbeque & Cafe at the corner of 3rd Street and North Hesperian Street has 
closed, as has Kawkab, which imported Ethiopian clothing and Zulu art. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggae and funk dance nights have been canceled at the Bombay Bicycle Club in 
Santa Ana and Club 88 in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gage said he has found a local barber but has given up trying to shop in 
Orange County. "Even though there are more businesses oriented toward us," Gage 
said, "I don't even think about it. I go straight to L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 One shop manager, Reginald Manning, is bothered by that attitude. "I see a 
lack of understanding and connection in the community, very much so," said 
Manning, 43, who is vice president of Crescent Books & Tapes in Santa Ana. His 
store, which has been open for nearly two years, carries books about "history, 
culture, politics, revolution." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not satisfied at all," Manning said. "I could certainly be busier." 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants catering to black consumers here might anticipate challenges, given 
the size of the potential customer base. Census data from 1990 shows that only 
1.8% of Orange County's population is of African American descent -- about 
42,700 people. Another negative is the wide dispersion of African Americans 
across the county -- there is no hub community. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet a large number of the county's African Americans are affluent 
professionals, the very customers that businesses would most like to attract. 
And there is growing sentiment in the Southland that they should spend their 
dollars with local black-owned businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that Orientals circulate a dollar 12 times within their community 
before it leaves," said Lana Smith, a spokeswoman for Recycling Black Dollars, 
a group of about 2,500 based in Inglewood. And how many times does a dollar 
circulate in the African American community? "Once," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her group had a chapter in Orange County for a short time, but it 
folded. 
</P>
<P>
 Rekindling that spirit is essential, said the Rev. Randall Jordan, minister of 
Community Cathedral in Fullerton. He and his wife, Joyce, publish a monthly 
magazine, the Black Orange, that serves as a "pseudo-hub," as Jordan described 
it, for the community here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people will specifically not patronize a business just because it's 
African American," Jordan said. "So I think there's a necessity for us to buy 
from black-owned businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 JoEtta Brown, vice president and community outreach coordinator for 
Irvine-based American Savings Bank, said that many companies owned by African 
Americans hide that fact. She estimated that 25% of black-owned businesses in 
Orange County have set up some sort of "front" operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concern is whether you will have people do business with you if they find 
out you are African American," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 From Brown's perspective, the big obstacle for black businesses is lack of 
access to capital -- there are no black-owned banks in Orange County, she said. 
In contrast, the Vietnamese community of Little Saigon, which encompasses parts 
of Garden Grove and Westminster, boasts several Asian banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Black-owned businesses must bank on more than sentiment to draw customers, 
said Ken Smikle, publisher of Target Market News, a Chicago-based newsletter 
that covers African American consumer marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incumbent on people who have these services to let customers know they 
don't have to drive an hour to L.A.," Smikle said. 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested a coordinated effort among African American merchants to market 
themselves. One message to consumers must be: "This business supports the 
community you support," Smikle said. The other: "Businesses should not be 
selling their image of what they are, but the image of what the customer thinks 
he or she can be. A lot of our perceptions, as African Americans, about the 
good life and social progress are wrapped up in what we buy and where we buy 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 To be successful, he said, a black-owned business must offer the same 
convenience, quality, atmosphere and selection as any other. On top of that, he 
said, it must use its sensitivity to the African American consumer as a 
competitive advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Forming local merchant councils, networking at minority business fairs and 
joining group purchasing coalitions are other strategies that minority-owned 
businesses can use, Brown and Smikle said. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, though, African American consumers say they are left to travel, fume 
or do without. 
</P>
<P>
 Len Hubbard, a banking consultant who lives in South County, said he has been 
writing letters for more than two years requesting that his cable-TV company, 
Dimension Cable, add Black Entertainment Television to its lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the decision to omit BET from their format is wrong," Hubbard said. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed out that two of his cable channels carry Japanese-language programs 
and that Japanese Americans, like African Americans, make up only a small 
portion of Orange County's population -- 1.2%, according to the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
 "BET is in English," Hubbard said. "There might be some white people who would 
want to watch it."

MINING FOR MEDICARE; O.C.-BASED HMOS SPEND MILLIONS TO SIGN UP SENIORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Surrounded by old photographs, handmade dolls and other cherished mementos of 
her past, Gloria Williams considered her future. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who will be 65 in May, sat at the dining room table of her cozy 
Midway City mobile home and listened intently as FHP International 
representative Linda Kadlac explained how the health maintenance organization 
would provide her with a primary care doctor, a hospital and 100% medical 
coverage in exchange for her newly acquired Medicare benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's depressing to think about all this," said Williams as she signed up for 
FHP's Senior Plan. "But I guess I should, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
 HMOs are spending millions of dollars to make sure that Medicare recipients 
like Williams do, indeed, think about how to pay their future medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
 With their so-called commercial plans -- health care coverage offered through 
employers -- approaching the saturation point in Southern California, HMOs are 
focusing on the only population segment from which they can still recruit large 
numbers of new members: the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor in HMOs' enthusiasm to sign up senior citizens is that the 
Medicare system is not likely to change much under pending national health care 
reform. Thus, seniors already enrolled in HMOs will be a continuing source of 
revenue for HMOs, regardless of changes in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 To attract Medicare recipients, FHP, based in Fountain Valley, and 
Cypress-based competitor PacifiCare Health Systems Inc., which offers the 
Secure Horizons senior plan, are spending heavily for television, radio and 
print advertisements. They are also using billboards, telemarketing and direct 
mail to reach potential members across Southern California and are sending out 
salespeople such as Kadlac to make the pitch one on one. 
</P>
<P>
 HMO executives will not say how much money they are spending to advertise 
their Medicare plans. Some analysts suggest that as much as 12% of the Medicare 
premiums they receive from the federal government go for marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no accident that FHP and PacifiCare are so large," said Kimberly A. 
Purvis, a health care analyst with the brokerage Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette 
in New York. "They have devoted hefty resources to the product." 
</P>
<P>
 FHP and PacifiCare are far and away the leaders in the field. FHP, with 
316,000 Senior Plan members, boasts the largest Medicare membership in the 
nation, while PacifiCare, with 311,000 Secure Horizon members, is No. 2. In 
California, FHP and PacifiCare together account for almost 60% of the state's 
760,000 Medicare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 Though their big marketing budgets cut into their profits, HMO officials say, 
the money is well spent. "If you aren't in the Medicare business," FHP 
administrator Marguerite O'Toole said, "you aren't in the medical business." 
</P>
<P>
 Such programs are attractive to managed-care companies because for each 
Medicare member they sign up, they receive a set monthly payment from the 
Health Care Finance Administration, the federal agency that oversees and 
disburses Medicare funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, faced with uncertainty about how a national health care system will 
affect them, health care providers are eager to find guaranteed sources of 
revenue. Most experts say that the rules for Medicare risk HMOs -- health plans 
in which Medicare recipients sign over their benefits in return for a package 
of services -- are not likely to change much. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior plans have become "a very important component to HMOs," said Peter 
Boland, a Berkeley health care consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The elderly also represent a virtually untapped resource for managed-care 
companies. Figures from the Health Care Financing Administration show that only 
10% of Medicare recipients nationwide belong to HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
 To woo more senior members, managed-care companies' strategy has been to 
demonstrate the advantages of particular programs -- no easy feat given that 
all plans operate on set budgets and are federally mandated to offer certain 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 HMO officials admit as much. "Benefit for benefit, there really is very little 
difference between the plans," said Tracy Tellefson, a sales representative for 
PacifiCare's Secure Horizons plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of managed care say that HMO senior plans are advantageous for the 
patients -- and even for the federal government. Medicare recipients can go to 
a single office for most of their health care needs without having to pay 
deductibles or a percentage of treatment costs -- 20% under the typical 
conventional insurance plan. And the government spends an average of $400 a 
month for each Medicare patient enrolled in an HMO, compared to $421 under 
conventional plans. 
</P>
<P>
 But with heavy emphasis on marketing, elderly rights advocates and others have 
questioned whether the HMOs might be tempted to misrepresent themselves. FHP 
was sued in 1991 by three elderly San Fernando Valley women who alleged that 
sales representatives did not fully explain the benefits provided by the 
company or various limitations of coverage. That same year, two investors filed 
a suit against FHP alleging that the company padded its Medicare enrollment 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
 The investors' suit was settled out of court, and a settlement of the women's 
lawsuit is being negotiated, said Kurt Eggert, the plaintiffs' lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Those two cases, however, spurred the federal government to investigate FHP. 
The probe found no evidence of wrongdoing, but questions about the potential 
for abuse prompted Group Health Assn. of America -- the Washington-based 
organization that oversees the 335 HMOs in the United States -- to issue strict 
guidelines for advertising and sales pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 FHP is not the only company whose strategies have been questioned. In a report 
last year, the Medicare Advocacy Project in Los Angeles stated that many 
elderly people are "extremely vulnerable to misleading marketing by HMOs." The 
report went on to suggest that some HMOs could yield to the temptation of 
cutting care to increase profits and that the federal and state governments 
should play a stronger role in protecting Medicare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the competitive nature of the HMO industry . . . and the rapid 
expansion of Medicare HMOs to new areas, the potential for future marketing 
abuse continues to exist," the report stated. 
</P>
<P>
 Geraldine Dallek, executive director of the project, said she still has some 
concerns but that larger HMOs such as FHP and PacifiCare have matured to the 
point that there are few, if any, complaints against them now. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Health care analysts say that, those issues resolved, HMOs can now concentrate 
on expanding their business and increasing their profits. Part of their latest 
strategy is to add members through mergers and acquisitions with other care 
providers. 
</P>
<P>
 FHP cited its desire to expand its Medicare membership into Northern 
California and Colorado as the chief factor in its recent failed attempt to 
purchase TakeCare Inc., a Concord-based HMO that has a strong presence in each 
of those areas. PacifiCare, which already provides managed health care to a 
large number of seniors there, has also reportedly made an offer for TakeCare, 
setting up the possibility of a bidding war to capture the estimated 145,000 
Medicare recipients in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Expanding into the Medicare business can be an expensive proposition for HMOs 
hoping to be new players in the industry, though. The needs of the elderly are 
much different from those of younger patients, said Doug Sherlock, a 
Philadelphia-based health care analyst and publisher of Pulse, an industry 
newsletter. Refitting clinics to accommodate wheelchairs, contracting with home 
health care agencies and hiring doctors with geriatric experience can make such 
a venture a money-losing proposition, he said, at least for the short term. 
</P>
<P>
 But once a company passes the 50,000-membership mark, the profits begin to 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some drawbacks," said Sherlock, who was formerly the administrator 
of a Medicare program for an HMO. "But that is a decision HMOs have to make." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the number of players is growing. In California, Kaiser 
Permanente, Health Net, Aetna, Care America, QualMed and Foundation Health are 
among managed-care companies that have started Medicare HMO plans in the past 
few years. Most of those companies, however, have only a few thousand members 
enrolled in their plans so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Lombardi, administrator for PacifiCare's Secure Horizons plan, 
acknowledged the increasing competition but said that trying to catch up with 
FHP and PacifiCare will be a daunting task, given the two companies' head start 
in marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 Secure Horizons, he said, "does a nice job" of identifying potential customers 
and putting on social events that draw crowds of retirees, some of whom are 
sure to enroll. It has also developed a network of "ambassadors" -- Secure 
Horizons members who volunteer to help enroll other elderly people. 
</P>
<P>
 On Valentine's Day, PacifiCare sponsored a "sweetheart breakfast" at St. 
Joseph Hospital in Orange for more than 30 local members of Secure Horizons. 
While a saleswoman gave a presentation and answered questions, Secure Horizons 
ambassador Clarence Leonardo stood at the door and welcomed guests. 
</P>
<P>
 A 70-year-old retired controller for a local concrete firm, Leonardo has been 
a Secure Horizons member for four years. He offers his services to the company 
for free, he said, because "it gets me out of the house." Just as important, he 
said, is that he believes in the plan. "I've never been much of a salesman, but 
Secure Horizons really does sell itself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least four people were persuaded to sign up on the spot. Others were more 
cautious. 
</P>
<P>
 Nima Al Babar, 77, of Orange, said he was curious enough to be drawn by the 
invitation he received in the mail, even though he has been a member with rival 
FHP for eight years. He didn't switch yet but said he is thinking about doing 
so. 
</P>
<P>
 "FHP are very good people," he said. "But these are good people too." 
California Stronghold 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, Medicare recipients were given the option of switching from 
fee-for-service providers to health maintenance organizations. The latter 
choice is becoming increasingly popular, especially in California, where HMOs 
have established a stronghold. Medicare recipients' membership in the top five 
HMOs: 
</P>
<P>
 * Southern California PacifiCare: 226,882 FHP: 204,444 Kaiser Permanente: 
127,077 Aetna: 48,556 CareAmerica: 17,239 * United States FHP 316,352 
PacifiCare 311,300 Humana 274,255 Kaiser Permanente 219,104 United Health Care 
89,216 * Western Membership 
</P>
<P>
 The Health Care Finance Administration's western region -- California, 
Arizona, Nevada and Hawaii -- has the nation's highest concentration of 
Medicare HMO members, and 80% of them are in California. Since 1991, the number 
opting for HMO membership in the region has increased 91%.

NORTHROP TO CLOSE ANAHEIM PLANT, LAY OFF ABOUT 100 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Northrop Corp. said Friday that it will close a plant in Anaheim, lay off as 
many as 100 employees and transfer 40 others to a factory in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant, the last Northrop operation in Orange County, has made fuselage 
beams for Boeing 747 jets for more than 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria T. Oharenko, spokeswoman at the aerospace company's Century City 
headquarters, said the company will farm out processing and fabrication work to 
subcontractors. As a result, 90 to 100 Northrop employees will lose their jobs 
.  
</P>
<P>
 "The decision was made as part of a continuing move to improve 
cost-competitiveness," Oharenko said. "The aircraft business is going through a 
difficult time," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 The transfers will take place by the summer. About 40 assembly workers will be 
invited to join about 300 employees of the plant in Perry, Ga. Managers told 
employees two months ago that the company was considering its options for the 
plant, Oharenko said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the beginning of last year, we have gone from five ship sets a month 
down to three ship sets," she said. "As we did our evaluation, the Georgia site 
turned out to be the best business decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Northrop's 747 program work force in Southern California has dropped 
from 3,000 to 1,900 in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop closed a larger Orange County operation, the Electronic Systems 
Division in Anaheim, in 1990 when it decided to transfer some of the plant's 
1,600 workers to Hawthorne.

POTENTIAL MEMBERS SHOULD ASK QUESTIONS; HEALTH CARE: MEDICARE RECIPIENTS SHOULD 
CHECK LIST OF DOCTORS, COSTS AND EMERGENCY COVERAGE BEFORE ENROLLING IN AN

 Carl and Miriam Greeneberg, as it turned out, were just browsing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange couple, both of whom receive Medicare benefits, were looking for a 
way to improve their health-care coverage while reducing the premiums they pay. 
When they got an invitation from PacifiCare Health Systems' Secure Horizons 
program to attend a Valentine's Day sales breakfast, they decided to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really are interested," said Carl Greeneberg, 75, who retired from Parker 
Hannifin, the Irvine aerospace firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple listened, asked questions and pondered. They left the breakfast 
meeting with new information but without changing their health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just not sure," said Miriam Greeneberg, 73. "We'll have to think about 
it more." 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce Dubow, an administrator at the American Assn. of Retired Persons in 
Washington, commends the Greenebergs for their caution and recommends that 
other Medicare recipients emulate them. As health maintenance organizations 
such as PacifiCare and FHP International Inc. scramble to sign up the elderly 
for their senior plans, the AARP advises that potential members take these 
steps before making any decisions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Find out if the doctor you prefer is affiliated with the HMO you are 
considering. If the doctor you see now is a confidante and friend, you may not 
want to change physicians. And Medicare will not pay the bills if you go to a 
doctor who is not a member of your HMO. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be absolutely sure you want the plan before you sign up, especially if you 
have the so-called Medicare supplemental coverage provided by many insurance 
companies. Dropping out of an HMO's Medicare plan may be as easy as calling the 
company or the local Social Security office, Dubow said. But reinstating your 
supplemental coverage may be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 * Though some plans have no premiums (apart from the $40 monthly Part B 
payment to the federal government), others charge extra for dental care, 
prescription drugs and eye exams. Make sure that the benefits are spelled out 
in brochures and fully explained to you by the HMO's sales representative. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep in mind that HMOs are not for everybody. Though most plans offer 
emergency care coverage anywhere in the world, not all do. If you travel often 
and far, Dubow said, keep in mind that virtually all plans have some geographic 
limitations. And if you are on an extended trip and need routine care, Medicare 
will not pay the bill, she said. Also, emergency care may be disputed if your 
plan does not consider your illness or injury to be a real emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure that the plan you are considering has a toll-free hot line that 
you can call if you have questions and counselors who provide help free of 
charge. Though large HMOs like FHP and PacifiCare have those features, Dubow 
said, some smaller plans may not.

MORE RESTRICTIONS PLACED ON WEST COAST BANCORP AFTER $12.1-MILLION LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 West Coast Bancorp, battered by bad loans and foreclosed properties, said 
Friday that it lost $12.1 million for the year and that it is now subject to 
more restrictions because of its eroded financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The red ink, a loss of $1.32 a share, compares to a 1992 loss of $7 million, 
or 76 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 West Coast, holding company for Sunwest Bank in Tustin and Sacramento First 
National Bank, said the liquidation a year ago of its Heritage Thrift & Loan 
subsidiary accounted for much of its 30% drop in revenue, to $28.2 million from 
$40.2 million in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal regulators imposed severe restrictions on Sunwest almost two years 
ago, and the bank's continuing losses now put it in a federal category that 
limits its growth and certain operations, said Frank E. Smith, West Coast's 
chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunwest, which accounted for nearly all of last year's loss, falls short of 
mandatory levels for capital -- its final cushion against losses -- and is now 
classified as "significantly undercapitalized." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said he doesn't expect the bank's core ratio of capital to assets, now 
at 3.34%, to fall this year below the 2% level that would put it in the 
"critically undercapitalized" category and render it subject to a federal 
takeover. The bank is required to maintain a 6.5% ratio. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, he said, the company will try to raise more cash for Sunwest from 
investors by the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sacramento bank meets all capital requirements, he said, even though it 
lost $300,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith attributed about $8 million of the company's loss to cash put in reserve 
for possible losses on loans, primarily loans to small- and medium-sized 
companies that serve Orange County's major economically distressed industries: 
construction, aerospace and construction engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 West Coast also lost about $3 million on the sale of properties it previously 
had taken back in foreclosure actions. Through those sales, however, the 
company reduced the value of its foreclosed real estate to $4 million from $13 
million, Smith said.

MISSING CSUF HONOR STUDENT IS FOUND DEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA and DANIELLE FOUQUETTE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton honor student Cathy Torrez, whose baffling disappearance a 
week ago prompted her family to launch a communitywide search, was found dead 
in her car early Saturday two miles from the shopping center parking lot where 
she was last seen alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Police released scant information Saturday, saying only that they had found 
the 20-year-old Placentia woman's body in her car and were investigating her 
death as a homicide. Officers patrolling the parking lot at Placentia-Linda 
Community Hospital early Saturday recognized Torrez's burgundy Toyota Corolla, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Administrator Robert D'Amato said the missing woman's body was found in 
the locked trunk of the car. The victim's arms showed signs of a struggle, 
according to D'Amato, who said he had been briefed by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators refused to say how Torrez died or whether they had any suspects. 
An autopsy is scheduled for today, according to the Orange County coroner's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "You expect the worst, but you hope," said Albert Gonzales, a friend acting as 
a spokesman for family members, who remained inside their home and declined 
comment when reached by telephone Saturday. "There's just a lot of emotion. A 
lot of pain. Everyone is real distraught." 
</P>
<P>
 Torrez was last seen leaving a part-time job at the Sav-On Drugs on East Yorba 
Linda Boulevard at 8 p.m. Feb. 12. She walked out to her car with a female 
co-worker, said "see you in the morning," and drove out of the lot, heading 
south on Bradford Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 minutes earlier, Torrez had called her mother from the store -- 
located about a mile from her home -- and indicated she would be home shortly, 
police and family have said. 
</P>
<P>
 The diminutive woman, a junior sociology major who had made Cal State 
Fullerton's honor roll last semester while holding down two part-time jobs, had 
wanted to become a social worker or a probation officer, family members said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "She worked hard for everything she had," said Tracy Comer, a 20-year-old 
Fullerton sophomore who met Torrez in a Spanish class. 
</P>
<P>
 In a strange aside to the case, Torrez may have been dating an 18-year-old 
Orange man who has been in a coma since he apparently attempted suicide Feb. 7, 
the man's relatives said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Rangel's mother and grandmother said in interviews that Torrez had 
visited Rangel at UCI Medical Center in Orange every night since he was found 
hanging by the neck in a warehouse where he worked. The night Torrez 
disappeared was the first night she had failed to show up at the hospital, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose Orosco, Rangel's maternal grandmother, said that on the first night her 
grandson was in the hospital, Torrez introduced herself, saying, "I'm his 
girlfriend. I'm Cathy." 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first couple of nights she was crying very badly," Orosco said. The 
family said Torrez told them that the night before Rangel allegedly hanged 
himself, leaving behind a suicide note, he spoke on the telephone with Torrez 
for three hours, until 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Placentia Police Sgt. David M. Taylor confirmed that investigators spoke with 
Albert Rangel's family Saturday, but said police have no reason to believe 
there is any link between the two cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seems to be a tragic coincidence that these terrible things have 
happened to these two kids who knew each other," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 And in an interview Friday, members of Torrez's family said that she had gone 
out with Rangel only a few times. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and family had held out hope that Torrez would return safely since her 
mother reported her missing Feb 12. They had papered north Orange County with 
flyers seeking information on her whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Unaware that police already had found Torrez's body, her friends passed out 
dozens of flyers Saturday morning at a Chicano Youth and Community Conference 
held at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who knew Torrez conceded that the hard-working, responsible woman 
was not the type to go anywhere without informing her family. In fact, family 
and friends have said, the 4-foot, 10-inch woman hated to be alone almost 
anywhere -- during trips to the store or even at home. 
</P>
<P>
 News of Torrez's death shocked residents of the close-knit neighborhood off 
Chapman Avenue where Torrez lived with her mother and stepfather, Mary and Ron 
Bennet, her brother and one of her two sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm numb right now," said Ken Luna, a next-door neighbor who was helping 
Torrez's family Saturday. "We're waiting for answers. That's all I can say." 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Bernal, a neighbor whose daughter used to walk to nearby Valencia High 
School with Torrez, said he held out hope to the end. "Everyone is surprised," 
Bernal said. "Even this morning when I heard it on the news, I was hoping it 
wasn't her." 
</P>
<P>
 Orosco, Rangel's grandmother, said Torrez was at the hospital the night before 
she disappeared. 'As she left, she said, 'I'll see you tomorrow,' " Orosco 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "When she didn't show up (Saturday), we didn't know what to think," Orosco 
said, adding that their puzzlement grew until Monday, when Torrez's mother 
called to tell them she was missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Taylor said patrol officers discovered Torrez's car sometime 
before 1:30 a.m. Saturday in a parking lot in front of medical offices at the 
Placentia-Linda Community Hospital medical complex, located in the 1300 block 
of North Rose Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "After searching the vehicle, the patrol officers located the body of Cathy 
Torrez," Placentia Sgt. Ken Gardner said. "The case is being treated as a 
homicide investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 D'Amato said there are conflicting reports about how long the car was in the 
hospital parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, not only do we not have a lot of information ourselves yet, 
what information we do have we are not willing to release," Taylor said. "All 
of what we know now is potentially relevant to our investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 The mood was somber at the Sav-On drugstore where Torrez had worked as a 
part-time cashier for nearly four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all shocked and grieving and working with the Police Department to help 
them in any way to solve this horrible, horrible crime," said Peter 
Bartholomew, a regional manager for Sav-On. "We're a family. This is very 
traumatizing for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the store, a lone flyer bearing Torrez's smiling, friendly face lay in 
a shopping cart. Just a day earlier, on Friday, Torrez's 19-year-old brother, 
Martin, stood in front of the store passing out the flyers as he had done every 
day since her disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Norman Z. Eckenrode said that he plans to suggest at the next City 
Council meeting, scheduled for March 1, that the city offer a reward for 
information leading to the capture of the person responsible for Torrez's 
death.

POLICE NET 104 GUNS IN DUCKS TICKET SWAP; EXCHANGE: ANAHEIM OFFICERS AND DISNEY 
HOCKEY TEAM OFFICIALS SAY TURNOUT EXCEEDED THEIR EXPECTATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There were tiny, pearl-handled pistols that looked like toys, a battered 
Egyptian field rifle, an 1881 Mauser military carbine and an illegal, sawed-off 
shotgun, the latter brought in only after a call from its owner seeking 
assurances that he would not be arrested on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The weapons were among 104 firearms surrendered to the Anaheim Police 
Department on Saturday in a successful, one-day tickets-for-guns exchange 
sponsored by the Mighty Ducks hockey team. The program, which joined two others 
in Orange County, was the latest version of the goods-for-guns craze that has 
caught fire across the nation and prompted the removal of hundreds of weapons 
from the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Bearing bulky, long-barreled guns wrapped in blankets or small ones stashed 
away in pockets, people began lining up in the morning chill outside the 
Anaheim Police Department about 9:30 a.m. Saturday. By 10:02 a.m., two minutes 
after the exchange got underway, police and Ducks officials said the turnout 
already had surpassed their expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether we had gotten one gun or 1,000 guns, we would have considered it a 
success," said Bill Robertson, a spokesman for the Mighty Ducks, as he gestured 
toward the line slowly winding its way toward him and the ticket payoff. "But 
we're very pleased with this." 
</P>
<P>
 The program, the first of its kind in the National Hockey League, awarded two 
tickets to one of the Ducks' remaining home games to anyone who turned in a 
firearm. The exchange was scheduled to end at 1 p.m. but late in the day, 
officials said pairs of tickets would also be given to a few stragglers who 
brought guns in during the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly, who stood in the Police Department's breezeway 
Saturday, watching the progress of the line, said representatives from the 
California Angels baseball team also contacted the city this week, wanting to 
sponsor a similar exchange. Details have yet to be worked out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Rosselli, a police firearms instructor who checked in each weapon, was 
taking no chances Saturday. Wearing a bulky, bulletproof vest under his 
uniform, Rosselli made sure each gun was unloaded, then tagged it with the 
owner's name. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners waited in a second line to fill out an identification form, then 
moved down the way to pick up their tickets and a congratulatory handshake from 
officials of the Ducks team, which is owned by the Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The guns, including rusty revolvers, vintage rifles and a kit-made Derringer 
that looked straight out of the Old West, were placed in rows inside the 
department and will be destroyed in the days to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those waiting was Jim Londo, a 37-year-old general contractor who was 
eager to turn in a revolver he found in his front yard in Norwalk about seven 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just mowing my yard and found it lying there," he said. "I live in a 
pretty high crime area, but I'd never seen anything like that before." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the way was Robert Siordia, who drove from his home in San Bernardino to 
trade in the sawed-off shotgun, along with a .32-caliber pistol, after officers 
assured him over the phone that he would not be charged for possessing an 
illegal weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied by his sons, Kyle, 9, and Joe, 16, Siordia said he had taken the 
shotgun away from a teen-ager on an East Los Angeles street about five months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kid was maybe 13 and was just walking around with it," Siordia said. "I 
just took it away and took the ammunition too. That gun's not just to hurt 
someone; it's meant to kill someone." 
</P>
<P>
 A former Los Angeles Kings season ticket holder, Siordia said he was delighted 
to hear about the Ducks' ticket exchange program. He and his sons received four 
tickets -- in trade for their two guns -- to the Ducks' March 13 matchup with 
Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other people said they were getting rid of guns they had bought or 
borrowed for protection during the period of high tension that followed the Los 
Angeles riots in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Erlandson, 27, of Fullerton said he had carried his automatic pistol in 
his car for a time, fearing an outbreak of further violence during the second 
trial of the Los Angeles police officers charged with beating motorist Rodney 
King. But he said he saw no reason to keep it now. 
</P>
<P>
 Farther back in the line, Mark Ross, 30, was holding his 3-year-old daughter, 
Danielle, and keeping a wary eye on 6-year-old Matthew, who was playing on the 
edge of a puddle. Ross said he wanted to get rid of a .25-caliber handgun that 
a friend had given to him for his wife to use in traveling to her job as a 
school nurse in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ross said his wife never wanted to carry the gun and having it around the 
house made him nervous, so he decided to use Saturday's exchange to teach a 
valuable lesson to Matthew, who likes to play with toy guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been talking about guns a lot and how real guns are not to play with," 
he said. "I wanted him to see all the people here turning their guns in to the 
police." 
</P>
<P>
 The ticket giveaway to the Ducks' games is the most successful so far of 
several local gun exchange programs, including others sponsored by Aamco 
Transmissions and Metro Car Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange police officials said the Aamco program, which is also being offered at 
nine other police departments throughout the county, has netted seven guns so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the Ducks are just more popular than transmission work," Orange 
Police Lt. Art Ramo said.

BREA'S ROCKY REDEVELOPMENT; GOVERNMENT: THE FBI IS ASKING WHETHER LANDOWNERS 
WERE COERCED AND HUD SAYS IT IS INVESTIGATING POSSIBLE MISAPPROPRIATION OF 
$400,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A decade ago, this tiny town that blossomed in the foothills with the oil boom 
of the early 1900s embarked on a redevelopment project like many others 
proposed by countless cities looking to put a new face on America's aging 
downtowns. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials bought and bulldozed homes and churches, wiping out entire 
neighborhoods and tearing down historic buildings, including the Red Lantern 
Theater where Judy Garland once performed. 
</P>
<P>
 The vision was to transform a tattered and run-down city core, dotted with 
vacant and boarded-up buildings, into a bustling, tax-producing shopping center 
and modern townhouse development that would become the city's pride. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet redevelopment became a sore subject in this town where many residents 
cherish its Old West, small-town feel amid the ungainly megalopolis that much 
of Southern California has become. 
</P>
<P>
 And fierce controversy has been the redevelopment project's hallmark as, at 
long last, construction is scheduled to begin next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the five City Council members involved in the process of property 
acquisition have either lost their council seats or the right to vote on 
redevelopment, following state conflict-of-interest charges, some of which were 
successfully prosecuted, while some were ignored, and yet others ended in 
acquittals. 
</P>
<P>
 But the redevelopment rancor in Brea has taken a new and serious turn, and the 
question pending is whether there were violations of federal laws as well. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI agents have been quietly scouring the area to ask former landowners and 
some still fighting the city about any coercive tactics the city's 
Redevelopment Agency may have used when it went after their land. 
</P>
<P>
 And officials of the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development 
acknowledged last week they are investigating the possible misappropriation of 
at least $400,000 in development grants that were distributed to the city 
between 1988 and 1992, the most frantic years of the Redevelopment Agency's 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 HUD kicked off its inquiry by asking Orange County, which distributes HUD 
funds to cities, to provide documentation for all HUD money given to Brea in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The new FBI and HUD inquiries could compound the troubles of this north Orange 
County community of 37,000 residents, which touches both Los Angeles and San 
Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials have already frozen some funds granted for highway 
improvements in Brea, and city officials have hired a Washington lobbyist 
specifically to help persuade federal officials to release the nearly $2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeze was imposed after federal highway investigators concluded in July 
of last year that Brea officials had abused their power to take property for 
the widening of Imperial Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Their investigative report said there were indications "that several property 
owners were coerced to sell . . . to the city of Brea . . . which threatened 
acquisition by eminent domain based on the highway project when in fact . . . 
(the property) was not being acquired for the highway project." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the federal report said city officials intended to transfer the 
property to its Redevelopment Agency, which at the time was supposed to acquire 
property only on a voluntary basis. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI officials declined to comment last week, but residents and businessmen who 
owned property near the highway confirmed that agents are now asking them 
questions about how their properties were acquired, and the city's use of its 
condemnation authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Veltri, whose Italian restaurant was a city institution, said an FBI 
agent came to his Fullerton home two weeks ago to ask "if there was any 
coercion or threats by city officials to get me to sell my property. I told him 
I felt I was coerced," Veltri said, adding that the agent expressed concerns 
about the lapse of time since the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Weiner, a Newport Beach attorney for one of Veltri's former neighbors, 
also confirmed that the FBI has requested a meeting with him to discuss the 
sale of his client's property to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Veltri, former Brea business owner Gary MacDonald claims the city 
improperly threatened him with condemnation in 1987, until he parted with a 
successful auto body shop on South Brea Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 In October of that year, MacDonald received a letter from the city offering 
him $455,400 for the shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Should you not decide to accept this offer," the letter stated, "the city of 
Brea does have the powers of condemnation to acquire property that may be 
affected by road-widening activities. Accordingly, should this voluntary 
acquisition not be agreed upon by you, the staff may recommend to the Brea City 
Council that condemnation procedures be considered in the future for 
road-widening purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 Five years later, and after he eventually sold his shop to the city for 
$535,000, MacDonald said he was shocked to learn from state Department of 
Transportation officials that his property was not required for the Imperial 
Highway widening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our review of the attempt to acquire your property and its need for the 
currently proposed widening of State Highway 90 (Imperial Highway) revealed 
that your property was, in fact, not needed for the widening project," states a 
June, 1992, letter Caltrans sent to MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's criminal what they've done to us," said MacDonald, whose business failed 
after he moved it to Placentia, leaving him unemployed and bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've completely rearranged my life. Not a day goes by without this hanging 
around my neck. I always thought the people are the government, the government 
works for the people. But in Brea, the government works for the developers." 
</P>
<P>
 Veltri said he, too, was threatened with condemnation, and only agreed to sell 
his restaurant location after municipal officials told him that they would 
eventually use the city's eminent domain, or condemnation, authority to take 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, however, city policy prohibited the use of condemnation 
proceedings to acquire property for redevelopment. That policy was only 
reversed in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was rather naive," Veltri said recently. "I didn't know I had the power to 
resist. It's like a police officer ordering you to the curb. You don't ask him 
by what authority he's ordering. . . . I didn't think my city was lying to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Veltri was paid $379,968.10, which the family used to set up a new restaurant 
in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 But there, without a building of his own, Veltri said property rental and 
other costs drove the family out of business for good in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "I invested in the restaurant because I thought we would build on this for 
future generations," Veltri said. "I never knew the city had to ruin people's 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Veltri's emotional business departure from Brea was made all the more painful 
in 1992 when he had to appear before the state Relocation Appeals Board to ask 
for moving expenses not paid him when he sold the original restaurant. Later, 
the board ordered the city to pay him $20,000, the maximum allowed under state 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. James L. Markman denied any wrongdoing by the city, adding that 
Veltri was provided "a very favorable deal." 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel bad for him that it didn't work out," the city attorney said. "I used 
to eat at his place. There is pain in redevelopment. Everybody acknowledges 
that. But there is no other way to do urban renewal." 
</P>
<P>
 As painful as this has been for some of the displaced residents and many 
business owners, the process has also taken a heavy toll among officials. 
</P>
<P>
 A newly surfaced report by the state Fair Political Practices Commission says 
that Carrey J. Nelson, a Brea councilman who now abstains from voting on 
redevelopment matters, escaped being hit with state conflict of interest 
charges along with former Mayors Ronald E. Isles and Wayne D. Wedin partly 
because the statute of limitations had run its course.

 "Although it appears that Councilman Nelson violated these (conflict of 
interest) provisions" by voting on matters while he had a financial interest in 
property in the redevelopment area, "this case is being closed with no formal 
enforcement action (because) the violations are dated, having occurred over 
four years ago," the FPPC report says. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the FPPC noted that the Orange County district attorney's office, 
which "successfully prosecuted . . . Isles, and took . . . Wedin to trial on 
similar conflict of interest violations . . . declined to file any legal action 
against" Nelson. Isles was removed from office after his conviction, and Wedin, 
who won acquittal after a jury trial, elected to give up his council seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Nelson, saying that he routinely avoids speaking to reporters, 
declined to comment on the 8-month-old FPPC report. 
</P>
<P>
 Markman, the city attorney, said he was not aware of the new federal probes, 
but speculated that they were probably instigated by a handful of downtown 
residents and business owners involved in condemnation proceedings or 
protracted disputes over the value of their own properties. 
</P>
<P>
 The leader of this loosely knit coalition, Markman said, is William Vega, 
whose family has sued the city for attempting to condemn their property, which 
is located on a prime corner of the redevelopment area. 
</P>
<P>
 Markman said it was Vega who spurred the district attorney's investigations of 
Isles and Wedin. 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging the Isles and Wedin investigations as unfortunate episodes 
in the city's recent history, Markman said he is confident the new inquiries 
will turn up nothing improper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never seen a city scrutinized by so many different investigatory 
agencies," Markman said. "I suggest that if you took the political and 
professional family involved in any city in Orange County, or anywhere else, 
and subjected them to years of these intense microscopic investigations, then 
nobody would come out more unscathed than the city of Brea." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Markman suggests that the worst is all behind, there are indications 
that the redevelopment project continues to tear the city apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, kindergarten teacher Kathryn Wiser ran for City Council on the sole 
pledge that she would oppose the city's use of its condemnation powers to take 
residents' property. She won, but now finds herself an outcast among the other 
four council members who are publicly committed to completing the long-delayed 
make-over of the old downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Heated exchanges with her council colleagues and city staffers have reduced 
her to tears on some meeting nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "The profundity of your ignorance is astounding," Markman told her at a recent 
public session. The city attorney said Wiser has brought difficulties on 
herself with her excessive requests for information and open distrust of city 
staffers. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council meetings are now a virtual arena for public venting on 
redevelopment problems, broadcast live to a citywide cable television audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The sessions often erupt into shouting matches, with residents yelling at 
council members, and city staff members chastising residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, for example, Police Chief Donald L. Forkus was called upon to wade 
into the crowded gallery to calm residents who were upset with the city's 
latest resolution to condemn Sam's Place, the city's oldest building and 
landmark watering-hole for locals and visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're ruining our lives and you don't give a darn," said Jim Cook, whose 
commercial building -- Brea's first City Hall and located next door to Sam's -- 
was condemned two years ago. "How can anyone negotiate with this council? 
Nobody is listening." 
</P>
<P>
 Said another: "Jefferson and Lincoln are probably sobbing. Shame on you, 
SOBs!" 
</P>
<P>
 At two particularly rowdy points during the evening, Mayor Glenn G. Parker 
called for recesses so that order could be restored. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Georgino, who became manager of the Redevelopment Agency in 1989, said 
last week that the city had not gone about acquiring residents' properties in a 
meticulous manner. "There were some things that should have been done better," 
Georgino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgino said the city was aware that residents and businesses had suffered 
financial and mental strain as a result of the project. "It's always difficult 
when you're acquiring someone's property," Georgino said. "But this City 
Council has bent over backward to treat people fairly." 
</P>
<P>
 Georgino said the city used the threat of condemnation against MacDonald so 
that the business owner could claim a tax benefit. When property is acquired by 
eminent domain, sellers have up to three years to reinvest their money without 
incurring capital gains taxes. Other sellers have two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly, the city's apparent misuse of its condemnation powers was 
highlighted as early as two years ago, when the Brea Small Business Coalition 
filed a lawsuit charging that the city had failed to abide by state law 
requiring a relocation plan for displaced property owners, and did not provide 
for relocation assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Robert C. Todd ordered the city to prepare 
a relocation plan, and questioned the manner in which the city was acquiring 
property from landowners. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said the city was not giving residents "good-faith" information as 
required under state and federal laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that the city and the (Redevelopment) Agency have been 'picking 
off' properties one at a time without encouraging business owners, residents 
and tenants to participate in redevelopment," Todd said. "It seems that the 
thrust of city efforts has been to locate major developers for the purpose of 
development." 
</P>
<P>
 Markman and other city officials said Brea has been generous in providing 
relocation assistance, paying out nearly $6 million since 1987 to move 225 
households and 41 businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those relocation expenses paid by the city, however, were part of the 
settlement reached in the business coalition's lawsuit settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of that settlement, the city agreed to pay up to $6,500 to 
affected landowners for reimbursement of legal and appraisal fees related to 
property acquisition or relocation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Parker said that while some of the displaced residents and businesses 
had quit Brea, the city has been successful in retaining a number in new 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've worked very hard to negotiate in good faith," Parker said. "When they 
(Vega, Cook and others) say we won't listen, that's not true." 
</P>
<P>
 Only adding to the controversy has been the pair picked by the city for the 
area's major project, a mixed-use development with a Ralphs supermarket, a 
Payless Drugs, a Cost Plus, an Edwards Cinema and a cluster of townhouses at 
the corner of Brea Boulevard and Imperial Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Chosen to build the project is a partnership involving Ray Watt, a former 
undersecretary for Housing and Urban Development during the Nixon 
Administration, and Tom Craig, the son of a former Brea mayor for whom a city 
park is named. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost half of the 50-acre parcel that the city has acquired for roughly $26 
million is being sold to the developers for $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a Redevelopment Agency memo recounting a meeting with partnership 
representatives, Craig's "political influence" was duly noted. 
</P>
<P>
 A staff memo from that April 3, 1990, meeting states that Tom Craig would have 
a 10% limited partnership interest in the project in exchange for his "$500,000 
cash investment and . . . political influence." 
</P>
<P>
 Markman denied that city staffers raised the issue of Craig's supposed 
"political influence" during an agency meeting. He said the memo to agency 
board members was merely quoting remarks made by John Hunter, the managing 
partner of the Watt/Craig team. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was John Hunter talking," Markman said. "It was John Hunter saying, 
'I've teamed up with a guy who I believe is locally influential and he's got 
10% of the project.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Hunter said last week he did not recall making any such comment at the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 About Craig's involvement, Hunter said: "Craig has invested real hard dollars 
to buy an interest in the property. He is an astute businessman who knows Brea. 
It is no secret what his abilities are. But he was willing to buy an interest 
to have a piece of the action, and it's a straightforward transaction." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter said the arrangement to build the shopping center was also beneficial 
to the city because the local government has been guaranteed up to 25% of the 
center's profits for 56 years. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, 80% of the shopping center space has been rented and long-delayed 
construction is expected to begin in March, Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Mayor Parker, construction will be a major landmark in a project that has 
consumed much of his local political career. 
</P>
<P>
 Elected to the council in 1990, Parker said he was prepared for the troubles 
that have enveloped the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Any violations attributed to the city in past state or federal reports, he 
said, were probably a result of "people who had not crossed the Ts or dotted 
the I's." He said he was not aware of either the FBI or HUD inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm convinced nothing was done with the intention to harm anyone," he said. 
"But one of the commitments I made was to finish the downtown and I knew we 
weren't going to make everybody happy. We're beyond the point of return." The 
Saga's Chronology

<P>
 1971: City Council declares need for Redevelopment Agency to rehabilitate 
blighted, unproductive areas of city. Council accepts plan establishing most of 
city as redevelopment area, including the old downtown. Late in the year, 
voters reject redevelopment proposal and plan to use condemnation authority to 
acquire property in redevelopment zones. 
</P>
<P>
 1972: Redevelopment Agency officially relinquishes power of eminent domain -- 
which allows government to claim privately owned land -- as a means of 
acquiring property.

<P>
 1977: Brea Mall opens. 
</P>
<P>
 1981: New Civic Center opens, moving city offices from South Brea Boulevard, 
near old downtown, to a complex next to the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 1983: Redevelopment plan amended to include commercial district in old 
downtown. In part of amendment, agency reaffirms commitment not to use eminent 
domain to acquire property. 
</P>
<P>
 1985: City on its way to acquiring property for old downtown redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 1987: Agency approves widening Imperial Highway, which borders downtown 
redevelopment area.

WARPLANES SET, CLINTON WARNS; BOSNIA: BUT HE IS HOPEFUL AS NATO DEADLINE NEARS. 
U.N. OFFICIALS UPBEAT, ALTHOUGH QUESTIONS REMAIN WHETHER THE SERBS ARE FULLY 
COMPLYING ON ARMS PULLBACK OR TURNOVER.

<P>
 President Clinton warned Saturday that U.S. warplanes are set to launch air 
strikes if all heavy weapons surrounding the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo are 
not pulled out or placed under U.N. control by the time a NATO-set deadline 
expires tonight. But U.N. officials insisted the withdrawal of Serbian 
artillery is well under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling signs of a Bosnian Serb pullback encouraging, Clinton said in his 
weekly radio address that he remains hopeful that there "will be no need to use 
force against anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 But he stressed that "American pilots and planes stand ready to do our part" 
by helping NATO to carry out its threat to launch air strikes in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina if Serbian forces do not meet the deadline at 1 a.m. Monday 
Sarajevo time (4 p.m. Pacific time today). 
</P>
<P>
 While Clinton used his address to prepare Americans for the possibility of 
U.S. military intervention in Bosnia, there were conflicting signals from 
Sarajevo about whether the Serbs will satisfy the NATO ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
 "We share the confidence that this can be concluded," U.N. special envoy 
Yasushi Akashi said, and Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, the British officer commanding 
the 13,000-member U.N. force in Bosnia, also expressed optimism that the 
deadline would be met. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Bosnian government officials sharply criticized the U.N.-supervised 
effort to clear big guns from around Sarajevo, claiming that many of the 
Bosnian Serb weapons were still in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muslim-led government appealed to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
to make an independent assessment of Serbian compliance with the ultimatum, 
which was set after a mortar shell killed 68 people in a Sarajevo marketplace 
Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic accused U.N. officials of capitulating to 
Serbian demands that most of the weapons remain in place and dismissed the fact 
that they were being turned over to teams of U.N. observers, arguing that 
surrounding the Serbs' artillery with U.N. forces only served to protect them 
from the threatened NATO air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see the U.N. soldiers being used as a shelter, creating an umbrella" to 
deflect any possible NATO reprisal, Ganic charged. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the case that the international community decides to take air strikes, 
these conditions will make it impossible," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Bosnian officials complained that, on the eve of the NATO deadline, 
hundreds of Serbian artillery pieces were still positioned in the hills above 
Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustafa Hajrulahovic, a member of the supreme command of the Bosnian army, 
told reporters in Sarajevo that the Serbs still had more than 100 antiaircraft 
guns, 70 tanks and 95 howitzers deployed inside the exclusion zone. "One can 
conclude the NATO Pact resolution has not been observed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The NATO ultimatum originally ordered that all guns within a 12-mile radius of 
Sarajevo be withdrawn or surrendered by tonight. But at U.N. urging, the 
ultimatum was amended to allow the Serbs to keep some of their 500 heavy 
artillery pieces within the safety zone as long as they are rendered inoperable 
or deemed to be under U.N. control. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi said Saturday that 100 weapons had been turned over -- 70 by the Serbs 
and 30 by the Bosnian government. It was unclear how many had been removed from 
the area. The Muslim-led government has considerably less firepower. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose rejected Ganic's assertion that the Serbs were using the United Nations 
to circumvent the NATO ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
 "To say that the weapons will be fired on the city is to ignore the fact that 
they are now under our control, and it's irrelevant where they happen to be 
located," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, a senior State Department official said Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev assured Secretary of State Warren Christopher that 
the Bosnian Serbs would comply with the ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia had offered on Thursday to send 400 U.N. peacekeeping troops to 
Sarajevo if the Serb rebels would accede to NATO's demands. The Russian 
peacekeepers, redeployed from Croatia, arrived in Bosnia on Saturday, wire 
reports said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic had earlier pledged to comply by midnight 
Saturday, a day early. 
</P>
<P>
 However, senior Administration officials remained guarded in their assessments 
of Serbian compliance, saying only that the evidence is still ambiguous and 
that poor visibility due to dense snowfalls was making it difficult both to 
move heavy weaponry and to confirm its removal. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozyrev, who spoke with Christopher for 30 minutes by phone on Saturday from 
Prague, said the Serbs "did not make any suggestion that the West should extend 
the deadline," the State Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, in his radio address, said American and other NATO military planners 
still "do not yet know whether air strikes will be necessary." There is "some 
evidence that heavy weapons are being pulled back from around Sarajevo, but 
others remain," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's caution on the status of Serbian compliance was echoed throughout 
the day by other senior officials, including National Security Adviser Anthony 
Lake, who said there were "hopeful signs" that the Serbs were pulling back but 
that "the evidence is still mixed." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior White House official, briefing reporters Saturday evening on the 
situation in Sarajevo, said Serbian columns were moving out of the exclusion 
zone but that there was "evidence that some weapons systems still remain in 
place in Sarajevo." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, military preparations for any NATO air strikes were proceeding 
apace. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry and Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, left for Aviano, Italy, after the President's 
address to review the strike plan. 
</P>
<P>
 They were being joined there by the defense ministers of Britain, France and 
the Netherlands for a final round of consultations before the deadline expires. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said Clinton spoke by phone with 
French President Francois Mitterrand, who renewed his commitment to tonight's 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Administration source, citing the heavy snows and poor visibility, 
cautioned against expectations that air strikes might be launched "the minute 
the deadline expires." But he added that "there will be no backing off." 
</P>
<P>
 At NATO's southern European command in Naples, Italy, a senior official said 
that NATO commanders had endorsed a "phased approach" in which limited air 
strikes might be launched against selected targets to see what the reaction 
would be. 
</P>
<P>
 If limited air strikes did not force compliance with the NATO ultimatum, then 
wider and more intense attacks would be launched in a subsequent phase, the 
official added. 
</P>
<P>
 The advantage of this phased approach, the official said, was that it would 
demonstrate that NATO is serious about enforcing the ultimatum while at the 
same time minimizing the risk that the air strikes would spark a wider war in 
Bosnia or trigger retaliation against U.N. peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging the possibility of American losses, Clinton again pledged that 
no American ground forces would be sent to Bosnia to "impose a settlement that 
the parties to the conflict do not accept." 
</P>
<P>
 But saying that the Bosnian Serbs "bear primary responsibility" for the 
violence that has left 250,000 people missing or dead over the past two years 
in the former Yugoslav republic, Clinton said that the air strikes were needed 
to force the Serbs to "seek a solution through negotiation." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking beyond tonight's deadline, Clinton said he had ordered American 
negotiators to intensify efforts to help the warring parties reach "a fair and 
enforceable settlement," and he insisted that the Bosnian quagmire was still 
primarily a problem for the Europeans to handle. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also told the nation that the world still "looks to America for 
leadership" and that it is vital to U.S. interests to prevent a broader 
European conflict.

 * RELATED STORIES: A19-22 Showdown Over Sarajevo 
</P>
<P>
 The current crisis point in the Balkans is Sarajevo. Under a NATO ultimatum, 
Bosnia's Serbs must pull back weapons by 4 p.m. Pacific time today. If they 
fail, NATO has vowed to send in warplanes to free up the besieged city. 
</P>
<P>
 Where Would NATO Strike? 
</P>
<P>
 NATO air strikes would break the siege by disabling the deadly guns ringing 
the capital and forcing the Serbian rebels to flee. Air Force and Navy 
reconnaissance planes have already pinpointed threatening artillery around 
Sarajevo as well as Serbian command bunkers, weapon-and-fuel storage areas and 
other "high-value" targets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Exclusion Zone 
</P>
<P>
 NATO has called for Serb heavy weapons to be moved at least 12 miles from the 
center of the city or face attack starting as early as Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 If NATO Goes In, What Are the Risks? 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian leaders have warned that Western intervention might actually widen the 
Balkan conflict rather than contain it. U.N. officials are concerned about: 
</P>
<P>
 1. 40,000 Muslims trapped in Srebrenica and the 50 Canadian soldiers serving 
as the encircled town's human shield. 
</P>
<P>
 2. A French battalion in the Bihac region. 
</P>
<P>
 3. A Canadian battalion in Visoko. 
</P>
<P>
 4. A British peacekeeping base near Vitez. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Red Cross and U.N. relief workers and journalists throughout Serbian-held 
territory. "In case of air strikes, all foreigners who find themselves on our

 The Forces in Bosnia and What They're Seeking 
</P>
<P>
 Background: About 200,000 people have been reported dead or missing in Bosnia 
since minority Serbs rebelled in April, 1992. They are seeking to overturn 
Bosnia's secession from Serb-dominated Yugoslav federation. About 10,000 of the 
deaths occurred in Sarajevo. NATO has issued an ultimatum to the Serbs to end 
the siege or face air strikes. The ultimatum was issued after a mortar attack 
on a Sarajevo street market Feb. 5 killed 68 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Army: Bosnia Serb Army (created from Yugoslav federal army) 
</P>
<P>
 Troops: About 80,000 
</P>
<P>
 Weapons: 300 tanks, 200 personnel carriers, 600 to 1,000 artillery pieces, 30 
helicopters, 20 fighter aircraft 
</P>
<P>
 What They Want: A separate state that could unite with Serbian-held lands in 
Croatia and Serbia proper 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Army: Bosnian Muslim defense forces 
</P>
<P>
 Troops: 100,000-120,000 
</P>
<P>
 Weapons: Mainly small-arms; limited heavy equipment; fewer than 10 helicopters 
</P>
<P>
 What They Want: Access to the Adriatic Sea from the Croats and links through 
Serb-held territory with isolated eastern enclaves and Sava River 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Army: Bosnian Croat forces 
</P>
<P>
 Troops: About 40,000 
</P>
<P>
 Weapons: Mainly small arms; limited tanks, artillery; fewer than 10 copters 
</P>
<P>
 Army: Croatian forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
</P>
<P>
 Troops: 3,000 to 5,000 
</P>
<P>
 Weapons: Fewer than 50 tanks; limited artillery 
</P>
<P>
 What They Want: Most want to consolidate their ministate and eventually unite 
with Croatia. Some seek a unified but decentralized Bosnia.

IN SARAJEVO, BRAVE DREAMS OF A REAL PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the clock ticked toward the deadline for halting the siege of Sarajevo, 
residents of this withered capital crept out from their cellars into snowy 
silence and dared believe 22 months of bombardment might truly have come to an 
end. 
</P>
<P>
 While few feel confident that the daily grind of wartime hardship could cease 
anytime soon, a tense but undeniable quiet has followed NATO's warning to 
encircling Bosnian Serb forces to pull back their artillery from within firing 
range of the capital or face punishing air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials insist there will be no tolerance for defiance of a proclaimed 
cease-fire, and repeated warnings that NATO is serious about its threat of 
force seem to have compelled the Serbs to move or surrender their heavy guns. 
</P>
<P>
 The absence of crashing mortars and booming howitzers at first unnerved those 
accustomed to the daily rhythm of a bombardment that has taken more than 10,000 
lives in the capital in less than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 But with eleventh-hour signs that the West's gravest challenge to the Bosnian 
Serb besiegers may be effective, even the most cynical survivors are talking of 
a more peaceful future. 
</P>
<P>
 The wider war roiling the Balkans and the strangling blockade of this city are 
far from over, they say, but a merciful reprieve from death and maiming has 
generated a feeling that the NATO ultimatum has brought them to a turning 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've said all along, 'Let there be no water and no electricity and let there 
be prices higher than anywhere in the world but, please, don't let there be any 
more shelling,' " said Ermina Music, who takes refuge from the city's savagery 
by working long hours in her cellar restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The blockade will continue, and we will remain trapped here like prisoners," 
she said. "But this could be the beginning of the end, and at least people are 
starting to talk about there being a next step." 
</P>
<P>
 The siege is not over, contended Asim Smajlovic, a war invalid peddling fresh 
vegetables and cans of meat sent here as humanitarian aid, but he hailed the 
halt of artillery shelling that has forced the city's 380,000 holdouts to cower 
indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The atmosphere is already better. People are walking around outside, and more 
are coming here for shopping and trading," said the sandy-haired vendor, 
arguing that those who defended Bosnia from a takeover by Serbian nationalists 
will score a psychological victory if the guns stay silent. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Sarajevans suspect that physical security may come at the price of their 
long-term freedom, as hundreds more U.N. troops have begun arriving to 
interpose themselves between the city and its attackers -- a move that may 
preserve the borders of a rogue Serbian state-within-a-state seized by force 
and subjected to "ethnic cleansing." 
</P>
<P>
 As the U.N. troops deploy to create a buffer zone between what is left of 
Sarajevo and the Serb-held territory that surrounds it, they are effectively 
partitioning the area along the lines of the territorial status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new borders will be those lines around everything the Serbs hold now," 
lamented Rasim Kadic, leader of the opposition Liberal Party. "At the 
demarcation line . . . now we'll have (U.N. Secretary General Boutros) 
Boutros-Ghali's border guards in the place of the Serbs." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. commander of troops based in Bosnia, British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, 
has described his plan for a cease-fire line as a temporary step to separate 
and protect hostile communities. 
</P>
<P>
 But many Bosnians fear the U.N. intervention will result in de facto defeat 
and ethnic division, citing the failure of the U.N. Protection Force to wrest 
occupied Croatian territory from Serbian rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would rather the war continued than that they would divide the city. We've 
been living together for centuries," said Hatema Gazibara, a 32-year-old 
Muslim. 
</P>
<P>
 Many worry that a U.N. buffer zone would actually tighten the rebels' 
stranglehold on the city by imposing a barrier to black-market trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Smuggling has helped augment the sparse and starchy rations provided by a 
U.N.-protected humanitarian relief network, on which virtually everyone in 
Bosnia now depends for survival. The clandestine imports have kept some 
semblance of a private economy alive amid the chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirsad Mojezinovic, a 26-year-old soldier defending the city, contends that 
the encircling Serbian forces have agreed to let U.N. troops patrol their 
seized territory because they hope it will slowly strangle the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't kill people with mortars, they'll do it by starvation," he 
said, predicting a long-term territorial stalemate. "For now, it's the easiest 
thing for the U.N. to do, to stand between us and them. Now (the U.N. 
Protection Force) becomes the border." 
</P>
<P>
 Often, discussion of the consequences of Bosnian Serb withdrawal from the 
proclaimed demilitarized zone extending 12 miles out from the capital 
degenerates into grousing over the hardships that won't go away with the 
retreating armor. 
</P>
<P>
 But people like Davor Popovic, one of the former Yugoslav federation's 
best-known rock singers and a native of Sarajevo, claim the atmosphere in their 
city is one of cautious hope and expectation for the first time since Serbian 
nationalists opened the siege in April, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this ultimatum, for the first time we feel the outside world grasps what 
has been going on here," said Popovic.

15 SUPPORTERS OF ANC MASSACRED IN SOUTH AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than 10 weeks before this country's first free elections, political 
violence intensified dramatically Saturday with the massacre of 15 people, most 
of them teen-agers, who had been preparing for a voter education workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 All the victims were supporters of Nelson Mandela's African National Congress, 
ANC officials said. Political bloodshed is common here, but the slaughter in 
strife-torn Natal province appears to be the worst single attack on a political 
group since the formal election campaign began last month to end more than 
three centuries of white minority rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said four unidentified men armed with AK-47 assault rifles and homemade 
guns blasted a hut in rural Mahele where the group was sleeping, and then 
hacked at the bodies with knives. At least three victims died trying to flee 
the attack. Twelve of the dead were under the age of 18, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A local ANC official, Zabuse Mlaba, said the group had put up posters Friday 
in preparation for a voter education program for local residents. "Those who 
don't want people to vote" were responsible, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police initially released few details. "I can say it is political, but I don't 
want to elaborate further," said local police commander Ben Lombard. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernus Kriel, the minister of law and order, said in a statement that the 
massacre "was yet another indication that levels of political intolerance and 
intimidation have reached very dangerous levels." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, the White House said it was "appalled" by the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 "We view the attack as a cowardly affront to the process of democratic reform 
in South Africa," Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Political leaders and international monitors concede that free and fair 
elections may be impossible in several pockets of the country because of 
violence. Although radical groups, both black and white, warn almost daily of 
looming civil war, the more likely scenario is an upsurge in the tit-for-tat 
attacks that have already killed nearly 15,000 people in the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not clear whether the bloodshed will simply punctuate the transfer of 
power to the black majority or will mark the start of a descent into racial and 
ethnic conflict, with a human and economic toll that will undermine attempts to 
build a new multiracial democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahele is southwest of Pietermaritzburg in southern Natal province, one of the 
country's most troubled areas. Members of Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's 
Zulu-nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party, which is based in the black homeland of 
Kwazulu in Natal, clash regularly with rival supporters of the ANC. Nearly 
2,000 people were killed in the province last year alone, almost half the 
country's total. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of the violence is clearly political. Traditional tribal and clan 
disputes over land, cattle, women and honor often form the backdrop to the 
political attacks. The impoverished area is beset by social problems as well, 
since many of the Zulu men work in mines, factories or cities far from their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 But tensions in Natal have risen in the week since Buthelezi announced that he 
and his party will boycott the April 26-28 elections, and his nephew, Zulu King 
Goodwill Zwelithini, unexpectedly demanded that the government cede him an 
independent Zulu monarchy that would include all of Kwazulu and Natal. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi has rejected a package of unconditional constitutional amendments 
offered Wednesday by the ANC and President Frederik W. de Klerk's reformist 
government to draw him and his right-wing allies in the Freedom Alliance into 
the election. At a news conference in Cape Town, he repeatedly refused to say 
what, if anything, he will do to persuade Natal residents not to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 But the South African Press Assn. reported Saturday that scores of people have 
begun fleeing the Kwazulu capital of Ulundi, where Buthelezi is based, 
following a series of attacks on residents suspected of being ANC supporters. 
At least one man was killed, and a woman's home was partly burned, after their 
names appeared on a list of reputed ANC activists. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those to leave was Simon Gumede, a senior aide to Buthelezi. Although 
he denied supporting the ANC, he resigned his posts in the Kwazulu Cabinet and 
Inkatha and fled Ulundi after his name appeared on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Although De Klerk said Friday that "the door remains open" for further 
negotiations, Buthelezi appeared to harden his opposition by complaining to a 
local radio station that he and his supporters no longer have enough time to 
campaign even if they wanted to join the race. He appealed for international 
mediation to delay the election. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not really fair (that) if our concerns are met now, they don't consider 
giving us space to campaign and to electioneer," Buthelezi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi has demanded full autonomy for Kwazulu and constitutional protection 
of the Zulu monarchy. His white-separatist allies demand a racially segregated 
volkstaat , or people's state, where they can govern themselves. The groups 
have threatened to use armed resistance to win their demands. 
</P>
<P>
 ANC leaders say one reason for Buthelezi's stonewalling is that polls show 
Inkatha would lose to the ANC, even in Natal. Buthelezi, a proud and prickly 
politician, would be humiliated by losing in his own stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela and De Klerk have ruled out postponing the election, the first in 
which the black majority will be eligible to vote. Mandela's ANC is expected to 
win the race in a landslide.

COLUMN ONE; DISASTER, THE MOTHER OF INVENTION; ENTREPRENEURS SCRAMBLE TO 
SATISFY THE CRAVING FOR SAFETY. SELLING STEEL-CANOPIED BEDS, PORTABLE COMMODES 
AND OTHER EXOTIC PRODUCTS HAS GOTTEN A LITTLE EASIER SINCE THE QUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now for the latest in California living: You start, say, with the stone-coated 
steel roof -- a defense against the ravages of quakes, brush fires and Santa 
Ana winds reaching, oh, about 120 m.p.h. Under the floors you install the 
patented temblor-resistant foundation system, lest the Big One rattle your home 
into the nearest fissure. 
</P>
<P>
 Flying glass? No problem when you coat the windows with high-tech, 
shatter-resistant clear plastic, strong enough to handle not only earthquakes, 
but Molotov cocktails and drive-by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside your home, you can gird for disaster with an array of specialty 
products. Secure that Ming vase -- you may need it to afford all of this -- 
with specially formulated anti-quake goop; just smear a little between base and 
tabletop. Now you can sleep soundly in your 800-pound, steel-girdered 
earthquake canopy bed. The next time Los Angeles is lurching and quivering like 
a rumba dancer, you might even snooze through it, unless you choose to be 
alerted with the newly developed seismic-alarm wall clock -- patent pending. 
</P>
<P>
 What better reassurance after the devastating Northridge earthquake than to 
know that the entrepreneurs are out there ready to serve? For whatever ills it 
might have wrought, the quake has also sent a powerful tremor through one of 
the nation's growing cottage industries: the manufacture and sale of 
disaster-related products. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that some products are gimmicky or impractical, or that some of the 
best-intentioned devices never reach the market. The greater effect is a nation 
more prepared than ever to face the forces of nature, bolstered by untold 
thousands of tinkerers and promoters for whom calamity is the mother of 
invention. 
</P>
<P>
 With every titanic earthquake, fire, flood or tornado comes a new spike on the 
sales charts of the one-pound collapsible portable commode, or the automatic 
natural gas shut-off valve, or the temporary, inflatable dam -- the purported 
equivalent of 1,000 sandbags. 
</P>
<P>
 New ideas are ever-emerging. Forget about building a better mousetrap. Far 
better, perhaps, to perfect that insulated, water-cooled, motor-ventilated 
family safety capsule, the only place to be when the roads are closed and the 
house is gone and the wall of fire comes blowing through. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're working with the inventors on that one," said Alan Tratner, president 
of the nonprofit Inventor's Workshop International Education Foundation, a 
Canoga Park-based organization that helps usher new products to market. "Every 
time there is something of major significance in the news, we get an influx of 
ideas. The dream is well alive in America that if you have a great idea, you 
can make a million dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Not many disaster products have made millionaires, but the impulse to produce 
such products is nearly as old as ruination itself, Tratner noted. Milestones 
in the litany of preparedness include the European castle moat, the storm 
cellars of the more recent American Midwest, the more ominous bomb shelters of 
the nuclear era 1950s and the household smoke alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember reading about the Great Chicago Fire (of 1871)," Tratner said, 
"and I think people were coming up with . . . (fire) alarm devices. I think 
whenever there has been a disaster -- in this country and abroad -- people have 
come up with disaster-related ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, disaster gadgets represent low-volume trade because their 
appeal is often regional -- confined to quake-prone areas, for example -- and 
many consumers are unwilling to buy products they might not use, according to 
some experts. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, social and economic forces are giving momentum to sales. The 
personal safety market is booming, fueled by rising crime and new advertising 
venues, such as cable television channels devoted exclusively to health, 
fitness or the weather, said Barry Mason, chairman of the Chicago-based 
American Marketing Assn., which tracks retailing trends. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we see the exploding number of cable channels and alternative 
(advertising) vehicles, products can be pinpointed to market segments as never 
before, in a cost-effective way," Mason said. "And as we move more into a world 
of electronic media, people are constantly bombarded by the hazards . . . they 
see on the news." 
</P>
<P>
 Add to all that a sudden ripple of the earth -- say, a 6.8-magnitude jolt that 
brings down homes and freeway bridges -- and voila! There is a demand for 
products where no demand existed before. 
</P>
<P>
 A case in point is the earthquake bed. One model, assembled of heavy iron 
pipes tested to withstand 80 tons of downward force, was an unmitigated flop 
when it debuted nearly two years ago. Inventor Curly Jon Ward, a race car 
builder, invested $150,000 to make 35 beds, then hired a marketing expert, 
mailed out 350 videos and arranged an 800 number to await the onslaught of 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a single sale followed. One bed found its way to Wertz Brothers Inc. on 
the Westside, where it sat as a floor sample for nearly 18 months -- until the 
Northridge temblor. Only then did a seismically motivated consumer take it 
home, at the quake sale price of $699. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just wanted to get it out of here," conceded store controller John 
Lundgren. "It's kind of ugly." 
</P>
<P>
 A different design, constructed of black steel beams and trusses rising to a 
central apex, has been more in demand at the Brass Bed Factory in Northridge, 
just two miles from January's epicenter. After a year of unpromising sales -- 
zero in 1993 -- at least five of the 800-pound behemoths, designed by managing 
partner Gary Waagenaar, have sold in rapid succession, commanding $2,500 for 
king-size and $2,000 for queen, said general manager Michael Calka. 
</P>
<P>
 A key selling point -- or maybe the only selling point -- is that an entire 
roof could collapse on it, and the bed would endure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a complete steel canopy," Calka said. "It almost looks like a bridge, as 
far as the trusses." 
</P>
<P>
 Less formidable quake products are moving more briskly. A small Monrovia 
company called Trevco has had to double its full-time work force, from two 
employees to four, to handle the sudden clamoring for Quake Hold, a reusable, 
putty-like substance that keeps vases, TVs and other objects from toppling. 
</P>
<P>
 A 2.6-ounce packet -- enough to secure "30 or 40 wine glasses" -- retails for 
$5.99, said founder and inventor Dran May-Reese. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just unbelievable," she said of the demand. "When we'd sell to a dealer, 
the (standard) order used to be 36 units. We're now getting orders from that 
same dealer for 1,000 units at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 Marianne Simpson, 49, a Thousand Oaks resident who has collected more than 100 
dachshund figurines, gave the reusable goop -- specially formulated by a hired 
chemist -- glowing reviews after the Northridge temblor put cracks in her home 
and left her husband's office a shambles. Not a single dog was overturned. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fantastic," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another entrepreneur, Richard M. Diaz, is making a similar retailing splash 
with his one-pound portable toilet, patented four years ago. The biodegradable, 
polymer-lined commode measures 10 inches by 10 inches by 2 1/4 inches when 
folded, and expands to a nearly perfect cube. Diaz touts it as cheap ($10 
apiece), sanitary and easy to lug to those uncomfortable places where water 
lines are ruptured or evacuees are crowded together in makeshift camps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our motto is: 'It's ready to go when you are,' " the 48-year-old inventor 
said. "With this thing, you just sit down and pull up a magazine and you're 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 Sales were "a couple hundred dollars" in the entire week before the quake, 
according to Diaz, who launched the company from his garage in Patton, a tiny 
town near Redlands. But with his promotional faxes filling the phone lines, and 
more stores placing orders all the time, the personal privy is a hot commodity. 
"Since the earthquake, we're probably averaging $1,000 a day, and growing," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Astute promoters were firing up the marketing engines right after the shaking 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers of a protective transparent film for windows called a news conference 
to demonstrate how the laminated plastic, known as Armorcoat, keeps glass from 
flying during earthquakes, hurricanes or even drive-by shootings -- although 
the bullets do come through. The plan was for Bob Kerr, owner of Window Tints 
Etc. of Redondo Beach, to take a baseball bat to a coated window as the media 
chronicled the dramatic result. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, no one showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 But by employing ads, phone solicitations and word of mouth, retailers were 
managing to get out the message. Sales of the coating -- billed as the latest 
advance in a technology imported years ago from Europe -- were running 200% 
above normal, and perhaps still rising. (The coating made a tenfold sales gain 
in Florida after Hurricane Andrew, one distributor said.) 
</P>
<P>
 "A million and a half square feet of glass did blow out . . . from the quake 
itself," Kerr said. "But whoever had Armorcoat on their windows didn't get hurt 
-- I know that for a fact." 
</P>
<P>
 State agencies, such as the California Department of Consumer Affairs, do not 
pretest such products to assess their effectiveness, but so far state and city 
of Los Angeles consumer affairs offices have received no significant complaints 
about quake-related merchandise, according to spokesmen. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial stakes for homeowners are often substantial. The window laminate 
must be professionally applied and runs $300 for a 10-foot-by-10-foot section 
of glass. The average price of a stone-coated steel roof is about $7,200 even 
when there is no obtrusive existing roof to drive up the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the expense brings a level of security that was unavailable 
a few decades ago. With steel-roof construction -- imported from New Zealand 
around 1980 -- a proud homeowner can expect security even when 120-m.p.h. winds 
are hurling wayward tiles from the neighbor's roof like so many ceramic 
missiles, according to James F. McMullen, a consultant for the Steel Roofing 
Manufacturers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 A steel roof is guaranteed for 50 years. Except under the harshest conditions, 
it is impervious to quake or fire. When brush fires ravaged Laguna Beach last 
fall, four steel-roofed homes collapsed in the eye of the firestorm, where 
nothing endured, McMullen said. But on the periphery, he said, a dozen 
steel-roofed homes held up like battleships -- even on one block where all the 
other houses burned down. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're fire-resistant, obviously -- they're steel," the consultant said. 
"The people that put on this kind of roof . . . are the people who want a roof 
that's going to be on for the rest of your life." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge resident Jill Brown, who bought one after her home burned down a 
few years ago, saw the quake split some of her neighbors' roofs in half. Her 
own house was pandemonium -- flying dishes, bookshelves, cabinets, TVs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the roof? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it even moved," she said. "It really helped hold our house 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Other products are still in the pipeline, under development for future 
catastrophes. As many as 50,000 to 100,000 amateur Edisons and professional 
tinkerers are probably out there at some stage of creating some 
disaster-aversion gadget -- either for earthquakes or floods or blizzards or 
some other calamity, said Franklin Bartels, head of the newly founded 
Independent Inventors Assn. of Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The concepts almost assuredly include breakthroughs and ill-fated contrivances 
alike. There are portable emergency elevators designed to descend the outer 
walls of high-rises, hurricane shut-off valves for offshore oil platforms, 
doorway flood barriers, earthquake indicator lights and fog-spewing 
firefighting devices. 
</P>
<P>
 Franz deGruet, an inventor and artist who calls his Los Angeles company 
deGruet ("deGruet is a problem solving organization"), has devised a system he 
labels Ultraspace for temporarily rebuilding quake-damaged highway bridges. The 
system employs what he calls "a lightweight, high-strength, tubularly derived, 
honeycomb-type structure," a series of bow-shaped rods laid over a metal 
honeycomb base. 
</P>
<P>
 Since conceiving the design seven years ago, deGruet has built model after 
model, but has yet to test the technology or bring it before state highway 
officials. For $50 million, give or take, it might have saved billions of 
dollars in lost commuter hours by providing instant bridges after the 
Northridge quake, he figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people think it's a crazy idea -- that it won't work -- but that's 
wrong," deGruet said. "The earthquake definitely came too soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach inventor Ernest Rinard, 70, has invested about $7,000 in his 
earthquake clock, which features dangling brass tubes that function much like 
wind chimes. For whom do those bells toll? For anyone who must be told that the 
ground is shaking -- and who would also fork over the suggested retail price, 
$80. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven existing models occupy boxes in Rinard's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Tratner, the Inventor's Workshop president, is at work on his own brainstorm 
-- an emergency "nightstick" incorporating an alarm and a light, and useful for 
breaking through doorways or clubbing would-be attackers. Tratner talked with 
admiration about other newfangled devices on the way -- with luck, before the 
next cataclysm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody came up with a Swiss Army-type disaster tool," he remembered, 
describing how it opens into a sledgehammer/hatchet/crowbar capable of smashing 
through glass or prying open obstructed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also designs for various types of all-purpose disaster suits, "kind 
of like modern armor," containing helmets, air filters, emergency water 
supplies and headlamps. One of those would be just the thing to keep next to 
the quake bed, the type of product that anyone in Los Angeles might appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if you slept in the nude, you could have it right there -- just get in 
and there you go," Tratner said. "I think the suit might be one of the better 
solutions to come out of these disasters."

NEW WELFARE LIMITS COULD BE AIMED FIRST AT THE YOUNG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Clinton Administration task force is likely to recommend initially imposing 
the President's two-year limit for welfare benefits on young recipients 
exclusively, while leaving millions of older people to collect public 
assistance as usual, senior officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials argue that phasing in the proposed limit in this manner would be 
more effective and less costly at the outset -- and would send a clear message 
of changed expectations to the next generation of welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 But the proposal also risks attack from critics who maintain such a gradual 
approach fails to fulfill Clinton's campaign promise to "end welfare as we know 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, which is emerging as the clear preference of a task force 
preparing the Administration's welfare reform recommendations, only new 
applicants and current welfare recipients born in 1970 or later would be 
required to work after two years on the rolls. Recipients who could not find 
jobs in the private sector would be given government jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plan went into effect in 1995, the two-year limit would apply initially 
to all recipients 25 years old or younger. Each year, the time limit would 
automatically extend to new applicants one year older. By the year 2000, anyone 
30 or younger would face the requirement to work after two years on the rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 The prevailing view in the task force apparently is to wait until the new 
system has been in operation several years before deciding whether to extend 
the work requirement to all other welfare recipients, though officials 
acknowledged that the decision could be reversed when it reaches Clinton's 
desk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the proper thing to do is to see how well the system has performed," 
said a senior Administration official. "Then in a few years' time you say: 
'What additional resources are we going to need to (expand the requirement?)' 
and do it then." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials maintain that focusing resources on a relatively 
narrow group at first would increase the likelihood they could find jobs in the 
private sector and hold down the potentially enormous costs of creating public 
jobs for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Those officials also argue that such a move is more likely to change the 
"welfare culture" and diminish dependency over the long run by targeting 
limited resources at one clearly delineated group, rather than diffusing 
efforts across the 5 million families now receiving public assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it is critical to break the cycle of welfare dependency by focusing 
on the next generation," said one ranking White House official. "It is 
important to send a clear unmistakable signal to a defined group of people." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.), head of the House GOP task force on welfare 
reform, said in an interview that a work requirement limited to younger 
recipients doesn't send a strong enough signal. "It doesn't get at the 
long-term dependent population at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor being considered by the Clinton task force is that a phased-in 
approach based on age would moderate the costs of welfare reform at a time when 
the Administration is struggling to pay for it by finding offsetting budget 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior officials still say the welfare-reform plan could cost from $4 billion 
to $7 billion after five years, with an age-based approach likely to be nearer 
the $4-billion figure, sources said. Clinton has promised to forward his reform 
proposals to Congress this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary estimates show that by 1999, about 2 million of the 4.7 million 
families expected to be on the welfare at that time would have been phased into 
the work requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 However, many of those younger recipients would not have been on the rolls for 
two years by then, and exemptions would be offered to those with very young 
children or disabilities. As a result, by 1999 the plan would require the 
government to find private or public jobs for about 300,000 welfare recipients, 
a figure senior officials say is within the capacity of Washington to fund and 
the states to manage. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan would place the younger recipients at the front of the line for job 
training, education, and child care, officials said. As a result, some 
officials acknowledge, the plan may raise questions about whether the 
Administration is establishing a two-tier welfare system, with younger 
recipients operating under an entirely different set of rules that demands more 
responsibility but also provides more opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Administration proposal, states would have the freedom to impose the 
two-year limit more broadly, as several have already requested. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force's plan is based on a proposal recently put forward in the New 
Republic magazine by Paul Offner, the top legislative aide on welfare reform to 
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.). With that 
pedigree, Administration officials believe that their proposal would be 
attractive to Moynihan, probably the most influential legislator on welfare 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the Administration plan, a House Republican proposal would 
impose a two-year limit on all new welfare recipients who enter the system 
after the legislation is passed. The work requirement would be extended in 1999 
to all welfare recipients who entered the system before the law went into 
effect. As a result, by 2001 anyone who had received welfare for at least two 
years would be required to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is a way to create opportunity for people, why deny anybody the 
opportunity?" Santorum asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that by 1999, the House GOP plan 
would require about 900,000 welfare recipients to work; the Administration 
believes that the figure for the GOP plan would be much lower, but still higher 
than their own age-based plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The House GOP approach wouldn't come cheap: The CBO calculated that by 1999 
the GOP bill would cost the federal government $7.3 billion and state 
governments an additional $4.2 billion. Estimates were not available for the 
cost to states of the Administration task force's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Governors and state welfare administrators have already signaled that states 
will resist shouldering additional costs for welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternative welfare-reform legislation introduced by a group of Senate 
Republicans would immediately impose a community work requirement on all 
welfare recipients deemed capable of work -- a group the sponsors estimate at 
about 2.5 million people. But most analysts say they consider it impractical to 
move such a vast number of people immediately into public service work. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration task force is expected to recommend that the work 
requirement be carried out by providing states with block grants to either 
subsidize private-sector jobs or to create public-sector employment for welfare 
recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 In the debate over how to phase in a work requirement for welfare recipients, 
the key constraints are cost and the capacity of the state and federal 
governments to manage large-scale work programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost is the most immediate problem. Because the government would provide day 
care, transportation and additional administrative oversight, requiring welfare 
recipients to work costs more than allowing them to remain at home. 
</P>
<P>
 In a review of the House GOP proposal, the CBO calculated that requiring a 
welfare recipient to perform community service work would cost $6,300 a year 
more than providing benefits without work. 
</P>
<P>
 That reality has compelled the task force to seek ways to circumscribe the 
work requirement, at least at first. The President has ordered the welfare 
planners to produce a budget-neutral plan because, under legislative budget 
rules, new spending for a federal entitlement program can be paid for only with 
increased taxes or cuts in other entitlement programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding those cuts has been difficult. The task force has been examining 
proposals for capping grants given to states to provide emergency assistance to 
welfare recipients facing eviction or utility cutoffs, increasing efforts to 
root out fraud in the Earned Income Tax Credit for the working poor and 
limiting Social Security disability payments to drug addicts and alcoholics. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force, however, has dropped a proposal to tax welfare benefits and 
food stamps the same way unemployment insurance is taxed. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, people who work part of the year and receive unemployment benefits 
are taxed on those benefits if their total income exceeds the income tax 
threshold. The task force considered treating welfare benefits and food stamps 
the same way, removing the existing tax exemption. 
</P>
<P>
 But criticism following public disclosure of the idea by the New York Times 
convinced Administration officials to scuttle the proposal, which might have 
raised as much as $4 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 40 other ideas are under consideration, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the fiscal concerns, Offner and Administration advocates for the 
age-based approach make three other principal arguments for the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 First, officials say, if a huge number of welfare recipients were forced to 
work at once, the likelihood is that states would be able to place relatively 
few in private-sector work and would have to create huge numbers of 
public-sector and community service jobs for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Though there is great political demand for welfare recipients to work, one 
senior official said it is extremely unlikely that Congress will approve a 
public works program on the scale that would be required. Offner agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, Administration officials contend that phasing in the work requirement 
would allow them to learn from the inevitable mistakes made along the way 
before extending the mandate to a larger population. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, and perhaps most important, the task force has been convinced by 
Offner's argument that previous welfare-reform efforts foundered largely 
because they did not provide enough resources to cover all of the intended 
target population. For instance, because of limited funds, only 15% of eligible 
welfare recipients have participated in the job training and work search 
programs mandated under the 1988 Family Support Act, the last major attempt to 
reform the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Offner argues that reforms are more successful when they focus on a limited 
group and ensure that everyone in that group participates. That kind of 
saturation approach has the best chance of changing the behavior of people 
already on welfare, or those likely to go on the rolls, Offner and his 
Administration converts argue. 
</P>
<P>
 But some question whether the youngest recipients are the best group to target 
for that intensive treatment. Santorum, for instance, maintains it might be 
better to focus on older recipients, who are less likely to have very young 
children and more likely to have some work experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Greenberg, an attorney at the liberal Center for Law and Social Policy, 
said he shares those concerns but added, "One of the virtues of starting with 
very young parents is the ability to change the message that the welfare system 
may send to teen-agers." 
</P>
<P>
 That may be especially important for the Administration as the debate over 
welfare reform appears to shift from Clinton's campaign focus -- how to get 
people off welfare rolls -- to the even more intractable problem of how to 
discourage young women, who make up a large segment of welfare recipients, from 
bearing children out of wedlock and entering the system in the first place.

DAMAGE RAISES QUESTIONS ON MALLS' SEISMIC SAFETY; DISASTER: ANCHOR STORES, SUCH 
AS NORTHRIDGE BULLOCK'S, WERE HIT HARD. ENGINEERS RENEW CALLS FOR RETROFITTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Of all the destruction caused by the Jan. 17 earthquake, among the most 
striking failures was the collapsed Bullock's store at the Northridge Fashion 
Center, where hundreds of shoppers might have been injured or killed if the 
temblor had struck during business hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that San Fernando Valley mall near the epicenter clearly fared the 
worst, interviews and city records show that other enclosed shopping centers 
suffered varying degrees of damage -- from a collapsed roof and cracked 
concrete walls to loosened brick facades and fallen light fixtures. Many mall 
corridors were covered in shattered glass. In one, a water main dropped from 
the ceiling, crushing a sales kiosk. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times survey of a dozen shopping malls within the earthquake's path, from 
the Valley to the Westside and the Crenshaw district, shows that at least 16 
major department stores remain closed because of quake damage, as do all the 
shops inside the Northridge Fashion Center and Fashion Square Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although city inspectors and private engineers are still trying to assess the 
quake's effect on these centers of suburban life, they have observed that 
anchor stores, especially older ones, tended to suffer the heaviest damage. 
They also have found that in many instances non-structural elements such as 
mirrors and merchandise displays presented more of a threat to shoppers and 
employees than structural failures did. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Northridge earthquake struck in the heart of a commercial center, 
experts say it affected malls like none before it, underscoring the potential 
for wide-scale casualties and the need for seismic upgrading. Of Southern 
California's 105 major shopping centers, about half were built before building 
codes incorporated the knowledge gained from the 1971 Sylmar earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were to take the same approach with airplanes, the public would quickly 
become outraged," said structural engineer John Osteraas, who is helping to 
prepare a report for the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute of Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Helmut Krawinkler, director of the John A. Blume Earthquake Engineering Center 
at Stanford University, said all malls should be re-evaluated for seismic 
safety because tens of thousands of people pass through them each day. "We all 
know how lucky we were that (the quake) happened at 4:30 in the morning," 
Krawinkler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Department stores seemed to take a harder hit than the malls themselves, 
according to city building officials and private engineers. Some speculated 
that the many partition walls of the malls' smaller stores provided stiffness 
to their structures and helped absorb energy from the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, experts said, the tall ceilings and broad spaces of 
department stores seem to have left them more vulnerable to the earthquake's 
shaking. They said large structures generally take longer to rebound from an 
earthquake's forces than smaller ones, leaving more opportunity for damage as 
they resonate. 
</P>
<P>
 Several retail buildings -- such as the Northridge Bullock's and a partially 
collapsed sister store in Sherman Oaks -- were made of reinforced concrete, a 
type of construction that the California Seismic Safety Commission has noted 
can snap under an earthquake's forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers examining retail outlets said they also have been struck by the 
volume of broken glass and poorly anchored architectural details such as brick 
and tile veneers, decorative mirrors and display cases, which could be lethal 
if they fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not focused on that issue strongly enough," said engineer Gregory 
Luth of Failure Analysis Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current codes, skylights must be made of tempered or wired glass, which 
can cost more than twice as much as conventional glass. But in storefronts, 
only the glass in doorways or in display windows that come within 18 inches of 
the floor must be tempered. 
</P>
<P>
 The safety glass requirement was not fueled by seismic considerations so much 
as concern that someone could accidentally break the glass and get hurt, said 
Nick Delli Quadri, a senior structural engineer and spokesman for the Los 
Angeles Building and Safety Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Decorative brick and tile also came loose in the earthquake, posing a 
potential hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 At Topanga Plaza mall in Canoga Park and the nearby Promenade in Woodland 
Hills, the palatial, brick-covered entrances to a Nordstrom and Bullock's are 
under repair and remain off limits to the public because of earthquake damage. 
An architect for Nordstrom said the facade had started to separate from the 
wall during the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "My speech is always the same," said structural engineer John Martin Jr. "The 
(greater) danger isn't in the buildings, it's in the architectural elements 
falling on you." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the efforts of structural engineers can be diminished by architects' 
creative indulgences, some engineers said. Fancy entrances and atriums with 
user-friendly open space can weaken earthquake-resistant walls, said Filip 
Filippou, a UC Berkeley engineer contributing to a university review of the 
Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Malls also can be weakened by the cumulative effect of small remodeling 
projects in individual stores, said Drew A. Norman, a structural engineer whose 
clients include Century City Shopping Center & Marketplace. "Any particular 
space within the mall may have been remodeled a dozen times since it was 
originally built," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts said that by far the most troubling sight has been the Northridge 
Bullock's, which opened in September, 1971, with the rest of the Northridge 
Fashion Center. 
</P>
<P>
 At the main entrance off Tampa Avenue, Bullock's brown-brick geodesic facade 
slipped almost entirely to the ground, leaving a gaping hole in the exterior 
wall. The view inside showed the top two of three stories squashed together in 
a jumble of concrete, steel and glass. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the type of collapse where no one survives," said Martin, whose firm 
has been hired by the Northridge Fashion Center to analyze the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Bullock's parent, R.H. Macy & Co., said company officials 
are attributing the failure to the building's proximity to the Northridge 
earthquake's epicenter and to the fact that the 24-year-old building was 
designed to codes that were in force before the Sylmar quake. The store's 
structural engineers are performing a more detailed analysis, she said, but she 
refused to disclose their names. 
</P>
<P>
 The architecture firm that designed the store, Welton Beckett & Associates of 
Santa Monica, is now Ellerbe Beckett of Santa Monica. Greg Nook, a senior vice 
president there, said he spoke to the firm's former owner. "He had no reason to 
believe that it was designed inconsistent with the codes or built inconsistent 
with the drawings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult to say what the cause was," Nook said of the collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 The top two stories of the building apparently collapsed because the ties 
between the floors and supporting columns were not strong enough, said several 
engineers who viewed the store. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't have good connections," said Ben Schmid, a structural engineer 
for 45 years and a past president of the Structural Engineers Assn. of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-story Bullock's at Fashion Square Sherman Oaks was also declared 
unsafe by city inspectors. The roof collapsed like a V onto the top floor, one 
city building official said. Like the Bullock's in Northridge, it was designed 
by Welton Beckett & Associates. It opened in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere at the 1.5-million-square-foot Northridge Fashion Center, the 
Broadway, two Robinsons-May stores, Sears and JC Penney remain closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of some department stores refused to discuss the damage, and city 
building officials said their inspectors have been too busy to conduct more 
thorough follow-up inspections of the malls. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the mall, a preliminary review by Martin indicated that the shopping 
center "took a very severe beating" that distorted its steel frame, but that it 
came through the quake surprisingly well. The full extent of the structural 
damage has to be determined, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60% of the mall's storefront windows shattered, some ceiling tiles fell, 
and everything imaginable on shelves and in display cases fell over, said 
general manager Lloyd Miller. The four parking garages sustained such extensive 
damage that they have to be rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other mall that remains entirely closed is the Fashion Square Sherman 
Oaks. Mall spokeswoman Sandy Turner said the 32-year-old shopping center 
suffered no structural damage and the city cleared it for occupancy. But Turner 
said the owners have been conducting a thorough review of the property for 
seismic and fire safety. To avoid reminding shoppers of the quake, the owners 
also want to remove all traces of damage before reopening, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Fallbrook Mall in West Hills, heavy decorative mirrors fell from atop 
one-story columns, and a 12-inch sprinkler main crashed from the ceiling onto a 
kiosk and "disintegrated" it, according to general manager Eric Knudson. "It 
was like something right out of Hollywood studios," Knudson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sherman Oaks Galleria's steel structure held up well, a spokeswoman said, 
but in a recently remodeled wing, several brass and glass light fixtures 
plunged in one piece to the floor. The mall's architects were investigating why 
the fixtures, measuring 10 or 12 feet long, broke loose, said mall marketing 
director Karalyn Lucci. 
</P>
<P>
 Topanga Plaza proved a testament to seismic upgrading. 
</P>
<P>
 Opened in 1964 as the first enclosed mall west of the Mississippi, the 
shopping center underwent a $45-million face lift two years ago that included 
extensive seismic work, according to marketing director Annette Bethers. The 
architects added a $4-million, steel and concrete frame to the original 
building that was designed to absorb the shock of an earthquake, transfer its 
forces back into the ground and hold its two stories together. 
</P>
<P>
 It worked, Bethers said. The mall suffered a few broken storefronts and 
cracked floor tiles and most of its stores quickly reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel smart and we feel more than smart, we feel lucky that we did our 
(seismic) work when we did it," Bethers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, three of the plaza's anchor stores that were built at the same time 
and of similar construction -- the Broadway, Robinsons-May and Montgomery Ward 
-- suffered varying degrees of structural damage and will remain closed for 
three to six months, Bethers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the earthquake struck, Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson had 
advocated retrofitting older, "non-ductile" structures -- those made of 
inflexible materials that do not move easily and could snap in a quake -- such 
as the collapsed Northridge Bullock's. Los Angeles has an estimated 400 to 
1,000 non-ductile buildings constructed in the 1950s, '60s and early '70s, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an opportunity to learn from things that have happened in this 
quake," said Bernson, whose district includes the Northridge Fashion Center, 
where he once ran a T-shirt shop. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Seismic Safety Commission, which is collecting information on the 
Northridge quake, has yet to hear evidence specifically on malls or issue any 
recommendations. But Executive Director Tom Tobin agreed with Bernson and 
experts that older, high-occupancy buildings of reinforced concrete "should be 
evaluated and the owners should be responsible for doing what is necessary to 
prevent a collapse." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether retrofitting should be required by law, Tobin replied: "I think 
eventually it has to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles developer Arthur Pearlman, state director for the International 
Council of Shopping Centers, said retrofitting should be done on a case by case 
basis, even for older buildings. "My personal opinion is that the buildings 
designed after the 1971 earthquake are all up to (current seismic) standards, 
and obviously more standards will come out after this quake," Pearlman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Tindall, one of the architects who renovated Topanga Plaza, said the 
$4-million seismic upgrade represented a modest part of the overall cost of the 
$45-million remodeling project. But Tindall, a senior partner at Callison 
Partnership in Seattle, said seismic upgrading often increases renovation costs 
as much as 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a tough decision developers will be facing," he said. 
"Knowing what we know today, I'm not sure it makes sense not to include a 
seismic upgrade as part of your project. And I think the cities are going to 
require it." Damaged Malls 
</P>
<P>
 The dramatic collapse of a Bullock's store in Northridge and other damage to 
malls has heightened awareness of seismic safety in shopping centers. A survey 
of a dozen major malls hit by the Jan. 17 earthquake found that, although some 
department stores suffered structural failures, most of the damage was 
cosmetic.

THE TIMES POLL; AMID QUESTIONS, PRIESTS, NUNS BACK KEY DOCTRINE

<TEXT>
<P>
 At a time when Pope John Paul II is calling on wayward Roman Catholics to hew 
closely to church teaching, a significant number of priests and nuns in the 
United States are questioning many of the church's edicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Celibacy for priests, the Vatican's opposition to the ordination of women, and 
its prohibition against artificial birth control are as likely to be disputed 
by priests and nuns as supported, The Times Poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite dissent over certain issues -- none of which go to the doctrinal 
core of Catholic faith -- priests and nuns are highly selective in challenging 
moral teachings or traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 By overwhelming majorities, priests and nuns are in accord with their church 
in its opposition to abortion, assisting in euthanasia, sexual relations 
between unmarried couples, relations outside marriage, homosexual behavior and 
marriages between homosexual couples. 
</P>
<P>
 And unlike members of the laity, priests and nuns view moral and spiritual 
issues -- not economic concerns -- as the greatest problem facing the country 
and families today. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyalty to the church as an institution is high among both groups, and 
contrary to popular perceptions, so is their morale. When asked if they would 
take their vows again, 87% of priests and 88% of nuns said they would. Although 
59% of priests say that the church should ordain married priests, only 15% said 
they would wed if permitted. The American media's coverage of the church was 
considered too negative by 84% of priests and 71% of nuns. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there was wider disagreement over whether the Pope is too 
conservative on moral issues, he earned high ratings for his overall job 
performance. A 74% majority of priests and 70% of nuns approve of the way John 
Paul is handling his duties as Pope. Local bishops or the superiors of orders 
earned similar marks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good news is that the much-advertised morale crisis in the priesthood 
affects only a small number of priests. The bad news is that a large proportion 
of the Catholic clergy do not accept many of the sexual teachings on which the 
present papacy has placed great emphasis," Father Andrew Greeley, a Catholic 
sociologist and author at the University of Chicago, said after analyzing The 
Times' data. 
</P>
<P>
 The results are based on written responses from 2,087 Roman Catholic priests 
and 1,049 Roman Catholic nuns in dioceses across the United States, including 
Puerto Rico -- a 42% return. The survey, which was self-administered and 
anonymous, was conducted by mail from September, 1993, through January. The 
margin of sampling error for the priests' survey is plus or minus 3 percentage 
points; for nuns it is plus or minus 4 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll sparked controversy even before it was completed. Shortly after the 
questionnaires were sent out, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, the archbishop of Los 
Angeles, publicly accused the newspaper of preparing to engage in "the American 
media's favorite pastime -- Catholic-bashing." Mahony said he was particularly 
offended by questions dealing with sexual issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Three independent experts, however, said the Times' data is credible and 
significant. Although they noted that the 42% return rate was lower than some 
previous samples and could result in some bias, they did not consider it a 
serious problem. Church sociologist Dean Hoge of Catholic University of America 
in Washington said: "If there is a bias, it's not a serious bias. . . . There 
is nothing in this poll which is so far off as to make me doubt the validity of 
the data." 
</P>
<P>
 The striking selectivity with which priests and nuns pick and choose among 
church teachings and traditions comes at a time when John Paul has issued a 
ringing denunciation of what has come to be called cafeteria Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling it a genuine crisis, the pontiff underscored his alarm in August when 
he issued what was described as the most important encyclical of his 
pontificate, "Veritatis Splendor," or "Splendor of the Truth." In it, John Paul 
warned of "an overall and systematic calling into question of traditional moral 
doctrine." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the United States, the Times Poll indicates that Catholic bishops will 
not have an easy time carrying out the uncompromising directive embodied in 
"Veritatis Splendor": "To be vigilant that the word of God is faithfully 
taught" and that Jesus' commandments and teachings be "reverently preserved, 
faithfully expounded and correctly applied in different times and places." 
</P>
<P>
 More than other factors, the poll found that priests and nuns were divided in 
their views by their age and whether they classify themselves as religious 
liberals, moderates or conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 One out of five priests -- 21% -- say they frequently counsel Catholics to 
follow a course of action that contradicts official church teaching on morals, 
the poll found. Among priests age 35 and younger, 27% do so, as do 29% of 
priests between the ages of 36 and 50. The oldest priests are the most 
orthodox, with only 10% saying they frequently offer advice that conflicts with 
church teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Pope's insistence that contraception is an "intrinsically evil" 
act that cannot be mitigated by circumstances, the Times Poll found that 44% of 
priests and nuns believe that artificial birth control for married couples is 
seldom or never a sin, while 49% of priests and 37% of nuns said it is always 
or often a sin. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of condoms as protection against AIDS was seen as always or often a 
sin by 46% of priests and 33% of nuns, but 41% of priests and 42% of nuns held 
that it was seldom or never a sin. In contrast, 16% of Catholic laity believe 
that using condoms to prevent the spread of AIDS is wrong, according to a 
CNN/USA Today Gallup Poll conducted in August. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times also found that 84% of priests believe that premarital sex is always 
or often a sin. In the August Gallup poll, 48% of rank-and-file Catholics said 
sex outside marriage was always wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many reasons there is dissent over moral teachings, among them the 
influence of the media and the general secularization of American Catholics by 
the larger culture. But another, in the Pope's view, has been wrong-thinking 
theologians. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Pope sternly suggested in the encyclical that dissenting Catholic 
theologians should be barred from teaching in Catholic institutions, priests 
surveyed by The Times were almost evenly divided over whether U.S. bishops 
should issue a formal declaration of rights for dissenting American Catholic 
theologians. Forty-two percent of priests and 44% of nuns favored such a 
declaration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poll after poll has documented this drift away from moral orthodoxy among 
American Catholics," Times Poll Director John Brennan said. "The current 
samples indicate on many moral issues, priests and nuns themselves are divided 
when it comes to loyalty to church teaching." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Gallup poll found that 73% of all Catholics said a person could 
be a good Catholic without obeying the church's teachings on birth control. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times found that 58% of priests and 65% of nuns agree that Roman Catholics 
may disagree with some of the church's teachings and still be considered 
faithful. The fact that priests and nuns may sometimes dissent from what the 
church considers orthodox teaching does not necessarily make them rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is true that John Paul has placed great emphasis on the primacy of 
the church's moral teachings in deciding between good and evil, Catholic 
tradition has also taught the importance of an individual's conscience in 
making such choices. 
</P>
<P>
 The conscience factor may explain in part why 21% of priests say they 
frequently counsel Catholics to follow a course that contradicts church moral 
teaching, for example, on birth control. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a great transgression on the part of a priest to recognize that the 
conscience may be a moral voice, even in a situation that seems to conflict 
with church teachings," said Hoge of the Life Cycle Institute, a religious 
research group at Catholic University of America. 
</P>
<P>
 The key, Hoge said, is that the conscience be "well formed" so that it can be 
a truthful guide instead of seeking selfish ends. Conscience, John Paul warned 
in his encyclical, "is not an infallible judge; it can make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Father Robert M. Friday, a moral theologian at Catholic University of America, 
said: 
</P>
<P>
 "In (sexual) areas, very often people have formed a conscience, say on 
questions of contraception. They take seriously what the church has said but 
have also found at a deep level of their own experience and conscience that 
there are other conflicting values," Friday said. "They believe -- not just 
feel -- that in order to be faithful to God and to their commitments to a 
spouse or their children that they need to (use) contraceptives." 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, in that situation, Friday said, he would explain the church 
teaching, and ask if they understand the authority of the teaching. Ultimately, 
he said, he must tell them to follow their consciences. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not saying it's OK to (use) contraceptives or it's OK to have an 
abortion," Friday said, "but you must follow your conscience." 
</P>
<P>
 But not all priestly advice or decisions by members of the laity that conflict 
with church moral teaching can be explained by an appeal to conscience. "One 
must note," Greeley said, "that on these issues the official church has little 
credibility, even among its priests, and the efforts in the present pontificate 
to restore that credibility do not seem to have been particularly successful." 
</P>
<P>
 On other sexual issues, priests and nuns are decidedly more doctrinaire than 
those to whom they minister. On abortion, a substantial majority -- 91% of 
priests and 79% of nuns -- say it is always or often a sin. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, a Gallup poll survey published in October by the National 
Catholic Reporter said that 56% of Catholic women say a person can be a good 
Catholic without obeying the church's restrictive teachings on abortion, up 
from 34% in a 1987 poll by that newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 By a decisive 80% to 14% margin, priests would oppose any church-sanctioned 
marriage between homosexuals. Nuns oppose such unions 72% to 14%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope is confronted by dissident priests and nuns on institutional as well 
as moral questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite John Paul's oft-stated insistence on an all-male priesthood, 57% of 
all nuns and 44% of all priests support the ordination of women. 
</P>
<P>
 This compares to 63% of Catholic laity who favor women as priests, the Gallup 
poll reported in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their support for the idea of women's ordination, 89% of the nuns said 
they would not seek it for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Priests generally oppose female ordination, even though 69% said they would 
like to see sexism formally declared a sin by U.S. bishops. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight in 10 priests who are religious liberals favor ordaining women, but 
majorities of moderates and conservatives oppose it. Priests ages 36 to 50 
favor the idea by 60% to 35% but priests 35 and younger are divided 46% to 48%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly many priests are unhappy with the status of women in the church and 
desirous of a more aggressive posture against societal sexism. But those 
feelings do not necessarily translate into support for women clergy," Brennan 
said. Only 47% of priests rate the status of nuns in the church as good. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Jeannine Gramick of Baltimore, a board member of the unofficial Women's 
Ordination Conference, said that strong support among women for ending an 
all-male priesthood is a plea for equality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women really are taking very seriously the whole idea of equality of women in 
the church," Gramick said. "They see ordination as a prime example of how women 
are treated as second-class citizens in the church." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to celibacy, the Pope has steadfastly opposed allowing priests 
to marry. But 59% of priests and 66% of nuns say that priests should be allowed 
to marry. The idea is particularly popular with religious liberals, moderates 
and middle-age clergy. 
</P>
<P>
 The majorities of priests and nuns favoring married priests are not as large 
as the 75% of Catholic laity who favor the change, according to Gallup's August 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a majority of priests support the idea of married priests, only 15% 
said they would wed if the church allowed it -- an indication that at least for 
most current priests, celibacy is not that big an issue for them personally. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll suggests that marriage could be instrumental in holding a few 
disaffected priests in the church, but the numbers would be relatively small. 
Three in five priests who are dissatisfied with their lives would still not 
marry if given the chance, while 35% would contemplate marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Among priests who would marry if they could, 58% still say it is unlikely they 
will ever leave the priesthood. Just 19% of those desiring marriage are 
contemplating abandoning their vocation. 
</P>
<P>
 There was additional evidence of the relative lack of importance of celibacy 
to priests. When asked to identify their top personal challenge, 3% listed 
celibacy as the top problem for them. Of those generally dissatisfied with 
their lives, 6% said celibacy was a big problem. That put the issue way down 
the list of personal challenges -- below maintaining their spiritual life, 
dealing with the influence of materialism and secular culture on the laity, and 
finding the time to meet all the demands made of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Greeley said the high morale factor calls into question not only the public's 
image of an unhappy priesthood, but a widely held assumption among priests that 
many of their colleagues are disgruntled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The much-heralded morale crisis seems almost nonexistent," Greeley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Why then are not more men becoming priests? "It's a puzzling thing, isn't, 
it," Hoge of Catholic University said. "I was told years ago that happy priests 
beget priests. . . . I don't know what the problem is." 
</P>
<P>
 Two priests who volunteered to be interviewed -- one who said he would marry 
and another who said he would not even if the church allowed it -- agreed that 
optional celibacy would aid in recruiting men to the priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Victor Lynch, 28, was ordained two years ago and serves at St. Thomas 
the Apostle Church in Bloomfield, N.J. He said he would probably get married if 
the church allowed it. Married priests, he said, would be a blessing to the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Maurice Larochelle, 34, pastor of All Saints Parish in Lancaster, N.H., 
said he would not marry. "I love being a priest and love being celibate," he 
said. "I had a healthy dating experience before becoming a priest, but I made a 
choice and I honor that choice. To tell you the truth, with the life I lead 
now, I don't know if I could divide my time between a wife and kids and the 
church." But I think some people could do it. That would be wonderful and that 
would be a good addition to the priesthood in general." 
</P>

 NEXT: The Times Poll finds that attempts to restore orthodoxy in the Roman 
Catholic Church may be producing a new crop of more conservative priests. THE 
TIMES POLL: The View From Inside the Church 
</P>
<P>
 Catholic priests and nuns are highly selective in grading the sinfulness of 
various acts. Most priests favor allowing clergy to marry but would not do so 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>

 Source: Times Poll of priests and nuns conducted between September, 1993, and 
January, 1994. How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 This Times Poll is based on interviews with 2,087 Roman Catholic priests and 
1,049 Roman Catholic nuns in dioceses across the United States, including 
Puerto Rico. The survey was conducted by mail from September 1993 through 
January 1994. It represents the response to a mailing of 5,000 questionnaires 
to priests in 80 dioceses and 2,500 to women religious in 45 dioceses. The 
samples of dioceses were chosen from a list which gives the total number of 
priests and nuns in all dioceses nationwide. Respondents within targeted 
dioceses were then chosen randomly from available lists. The questionnaires 
were self-administered and anonymous, though some respondents volunteered to be 
interviewed and quoted by name. Both samples were weighted slightly to account 
for variations in the number of responses received from each diocese. 
</P>
<P>
 The demographics of both surveys have been examined by academic experts in the 
field of priests and nuns sociology and have been found comparable to previous 
research in this area. The margin of sampling error for the survey of priests 
is plus or minus 3 percentage points; for the survey of nuns it is plus or 
minus 4 points. In both polls, results based on subgroups may have a somewhat 
higher sampling error. Results to polls can also be affected by other factors 
such as question wording and the reluctance of some respondents to participate 
in surveys.

ATTACKS AT SCHOOLS POSE RISING FEAR 
</P>

<P>
 The memory of rushing her son off to school last Feb. 22 still haunts Margaret 
Ensley. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so slow, he just moved so slowly," she recalled. "I kept after him: 
'Hurry up, you'll miss the school bus.' . . . I hurried him to his death." 
</P>
<P>
 At 10:10 that morning, Michael Ensley was shot dead during a snack break at 
Reseda High School -- the second Los Angeles Unified School District student to 
die from campus gunfire in a month. One year later, the tragedy haunts his 
mother as well as school officials struggling to reduce campus violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The school system has expelled a record number of students for bringing guns 
and knives on campus and has begun using metal detectors to search students for 
weapons. But students continue to bring weapons to school in large numbers. 
Supt. Sid Thompson acknowledges that school officials remain unable to ensure 
the safety of the district's 640,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't do anything that's absolutely going to guarantee the safety of kids," 
Thompson said in an interview. "If I had a magic wand, I'd get additional 
funding for more police officers. I'd put 300 additional campus aides to assist 
in supervision on our campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without money, it's a tough one," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the year since Ensley died, school violence has become a hot political 
topic. Both Gov. Pete Wilson's crime summit and Assembly Speaker Willie Brown's 
education summit had panels on the subject. Two mothers of students killed on 
campuses -- including Ensley -- have formed a group to keep the issue alive. 
</P>
<P>
 On campus, students are reminded of the threat of school violence by the metal 
detectors used at every high school and middle school and signs proclaiming 
that bringing a gun to school can get you expelled -- and advertising a phone 
number for students to turn in their classmates. Teachers, for the first time, 
are being told when violent students are transferred to their classrooms. And 
principals have been directed to keep campuses secure and gates locked. 
</P>
<P>
 Students say there is a climate of fear on some campuses and that they are 
reminded of the problem continuously. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone worries about it," said Glenn Browne Jr., who was shot and 
critically wounded at Dorsey High in September and has transferred to a new 
campus. "I know I do and my friends all do." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem has escalated so high that many students believe they must arm 
themselves for protection and there is little shock at seeing a weapon on 
campus, said school district police Chief Wes Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has become an informal social norm that kids need to protect themselves, 
so why not carry the tools to protect themselves?" said Mitchell, who added 
that the district should provide more education about guns and violence. "There 
are no short-term solutions to this problem. The only real solution is to 
change attitudes. In our society, it's as normal to shoot someone now as it was 
to punch someone 10 years ago. When is this going to change in our kids?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Education toughened its expulsion policy after last year's 
shootings. In the 1992-93 school year, the board expelled 241 students compared 
to 95 the previous year, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 But the expulsion records also suggest that the number of students bringing 
weapons to school has not dropped. In the 1992-93 school year, 592 students 
were recommended for expulsion for weapons, compared to 504 the previous year. 
Some students were sent to alternative schools or, for a variety of reasons, 
were not expelled. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting incidents last year struck at campuses across the district. 
Because the cases were not isolated in one section of the city, parents and 
students throughout the system were forced to confront the problem. Ironically, 
two of the shooting victims were attending schools they believed were safer 
than campuses in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Ensley was bused to Reseda from his home in South-Central Los Angeles because 
his mother believed the school was safe. She said she would have done anything 
to give her son a secure school atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't like he was out robbing someone," Margaret Ensley said. "The law 
says I have to send my son to school. So I sent him to a school I thought was 
safe. It wasn't like he was in the wrong place." 
</P>
<P>
 Ensley was shot by a 15-year-old classmate, Robert Heard, who ran sobbing 
across the campus and was arrested in a nearby doughnut shop. He is awaiting 
trial on murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Ensley's violent death came a month after another fatal shooting on a Los 
Angeles campus. Demetrius Rice, a 16-year-old student at Fairfax High, was shot 
to death by a classmate who accidentally fired a .357 magnum during an English 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 Since those incidents, a student was wounded at Dorsey High while waiting in a 
registration line on the first day of school in September. Another student was 
critically injured at Chatsworth High while waiting for his mother to pick him 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 Ensley and the father of the Dorsey student sued the district in the past 
week, charging that the schools failed to provide adequate safety and 
supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Browne Sr., whose son was shot Sept. 7, said the district should have 
provided more supervision and never should have allowed outsiders on the 
campus. His son was shot by an 18-year-old gang member who was looking for 
someone else, officials said. Bryant Boyd has been arraigned and is awaiting 
trial on attempted murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something like this should have never happened," Browne said. "When I send my 
kids to school, I expect them to be safe. I enrolled them at Dorsey for a 
reason." 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Browne Jr. lost a kidney and will never again participate in sports. His 
younger brother, Deon, was at his side when the shooting occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm scared -- I'm still scared," said Glenn Jr. "I'm scared that they will 
come back and get me. I think about my body (and) how messed up I am. I can't 
play football or any sports at all. I can't really do nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, 17-year-old Gabriel Gettleson was shot at Chatsworth High when 
he refused to give his backpack to two boys. Gettleson was waiting for his 
mother to pick him up and take him to his job. 
</P>
<P>
 After weeks in the intensive care unit at Northridge Hospital Medical Center, 
the Gettleson family moved from Northridge to an undisclosed location, school 
officials said. "After the earthquake, it was too much and they moved," said 
Donna Smith, principal at Chatsworth High. 
</P>
<P>
 The shootings at Fairfax and Reseda brought two mothers together to fight for 
school safety. Mildred Hillard, whose son Demetrius Rice was killed at Fairfax 
on Jan. 21, 1993, formed Mothers Against Violence In Schools with Ensley. They 
have appeared on panels, met with politicians and say they will never let their 
children be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a year and we're just now talking about protecting our children," 
Hillard said. "How many more children are going to die? How many more lives 
will it take before they start acting faster?" 
</P>
<P>
 The district spends $25 million of its $3.9-billion budget on its police force 
and Thompson said he will not spend more. "I could have bought a lot of books 
with that," he said. "I'm just not willing to cut jobs from one place to add to 
another." 
</P>
<P>
 School crime reports show that district police took 774 reports of 
weapons-related incidents in 1993 and 895 reports in 1992. The school police 
recovered 127 guns in 1993 and 168 guns in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's metal detector program, which randomly screens about 25 
students per day at each high school and middle school, has failed to turn up 
any weapons. An anonymous tip hot line received about 20 calls a day at its 
height last fall but dropped to about three by December. Almost none have come 
in since the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has made some cosmetic changes: police cars are being painted 
white with a bright blue "police" logo and officers now are in uniform on 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 A task force created by school board member Mark Slavkin in the wake of the 
rash of school violence came up with some new safety measures but anything that 
costs money has been tabled. The panel proposed training teachers and other 
school staff members in gang prevention methods and using school psychologists 
to intervene with problem students. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said he has been studying the recommendations and plans to announce 
his new proposals for better security next month. They will include requiring 
every school to have a safety plan and better coordination between agencies and 
services that deal with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the district's 292 police officers patrol the 400 elementary schools and 
are stationed on all but 22 junior high and high school campuses. Thompson said 
he would like every secondary school to have a police officer on campus but 
that he probably will not have the money. 
</P>
<P>
 At the campuses where the shootings occurred -- Fairfax, Reseda, Dorsey and 
Chatsworth -- administrators say there is a renewed effort to focus on school 
security. They say they are working on new programs to increase students' 
awareness of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 At Reseda, students are producing skits about weapons and breaking the code of 
silence that exists among them about guns. The students also follow a dress 
code that bans clothing that could be viewed as gang attire. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of the shootings has been deep for students and staff on those 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I was going through that experience on January 21st, I knew that no matter 
what I did in this school district -- good or bad -- nothing would ever equal 
what I was doing that morning," said Michael Bennett, the principal at Fairfax. 
"It was 8:15 in the morning and boom, the history of this school changed with 
that heartbeat."

A YEAR AFTER WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING, TERRORISM SEEMS REMOTE; NEW YORK: AT 
FIRST, EXPERTS PREDICTED A WAVE OF INCIDENTS. BUT NOW IT SEEMS MORE LIKE TRUCK 
BACKFIRING ON THE FOURTH OF JULY -- A BRIEF DISTRACTION. SOME WARN, HOWEVER, 
THAT THE WORST COULD BE TO COME.

 A year later, the lunch bag left on the park bench is not a "suspicious 
package." 
</P>
<P>
 Motorists need not pop the trunk before entering the Rockefeller Center 
parking garage, and tourists don't have to line up at metal detectors in the 
Empire State Building. The Plaza's lobby no longer looks like a Secret Service 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Trade Center bombing, once regarded as a sign that terrorism had 
finally crossed the oceans to America, now seems more like a truck backfiring 
on the Fourth of July -- a momentary distraction, soon forgotten amidst the 
general cacophony. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think very much about it anymore," said Patricia Renton, a paralegal 
who works at the Trade Center. "There are other things to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
 On the afternoon of Feb. 26, 1993, however, there was only the bomb. It shook 
the nation's two largest office towers, killed six people, injured another 
1,000 and closed the complex for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually there would be arrests of a group of Islamic fundamentalists, 
followers of a storefront preacher with a seething contempt for Western 
modernity; revelations of the suspects' anger over U.S. policy in the Middle 
East; a long and largely uneventful trial that was winding up with closing 
arguments last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But what the nation remembers are the images of Feb. 26 -- tens of thousands 
of office workers streaming into the street, bewildered and exhausted, their 
faces streaked with smoke, sweat and tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have that feeling of being violated," said Gov. Mario Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts warned of more of the same. Then-FBI Director William Sessions said 
the bombing "could be the harbinger of a new era." RAND Corp. analyst Bruce 
Hoffman called it "a watershed. . . . We are incredibly vulnerable. Everyone is 
going to be looking at us." 
</P>
<P>
 Our borders were porous. Our policies were unpopular. "We are in very deep 
trouble," said Robert Kupperman, another terrorism expert. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack's success was said to have offered encouragement to almost anyone 
with a grudge and a bomb. If the center's bombers were amateurs, that showed 
anyone could do it; if they were pros, that meant foreign terrorists were ready 
to strike the home front. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, of course, Americans had been installing metal detectors, 
closed-circuit televisions and car barricades. Now there were calls for even 
more security, an unappealing prospect to those already living behind 
triple-locked doors and window bars. 
</P>
<P>
 But a funny thing happened: 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged perpetrators were quickly arrested, and four months later a 
related cell also was rounded up -- before, authorities said, it could blow up 
the Lincoln Tunnel, the United Nations and other targets. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI increased surveillance of other suspected terrorists and reportedly 
told them, in so many words, "Don't even think about it." The State Department 
started a computerized program to make sure suspected terrorists overseas don't 
get entry visas. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission tightened security 
requirements for nuclear power plants. 
</P>
<P>
 And, mostly without realizing it, Americans declared the Trade Center episode 
a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days after the blast, the President of the United States outlined the 
rules. The terrorists win half the battle, said Bill Clinton, "if they can get 
us to change the way we live and what we do." 
</P>
<P>
 So the windows were replaced, the soot was washed off and the holes were 
patched. The nation moved on; the terrorists lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was extremely pessimistic a year ago," said Kupperman. "Now I'm much less 
so." 
</P>
<P>
 The Trade Center itself still bears many signs of the bombing, including its 
shuttered underground garage and rooftop restaurant. But elsewhere, "very 
little has changed," said Philip Stern, a former prosecutor who manages the 
Fairfax Group, a security service. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no additional security at bridges or tunnels. You can walk into most 
office building lobbies and get onto an elevator without identification. Very 
few companies have taken serious security steps." 
</P>
<P>
 Terrorism continues to be a problem, but largely a foreign problem. The 
weekend of the Trade Center blast there were bombings in Cairo, London and 
Lima. On two separate days in 1993, Kurdish terrorists attacked about 75 
separate Turkish targets around Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of global terrorist incidents logged by the State Department 
increased from 361 in 1992 to 427 last year. But '93 compared favorably to '91, 
when there were 557 incidents. More than half of those involved U.S. citizens 
or property, compared to only about 20% last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides time and benign neglect, there was another reason the bombing faded 
from consciousness: It was an act of violence in what Cuomo, speaking Feb. 28, 
called "the most violent place in the world -- not because they do it to us but 
because we do it to ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 A year later the bombing seems nefarious but not remarkable, not in a nation 
where gunshots kill more than 100 people a day; not in a state where more 
people die from gunshots than auto accidents; not in a city where gun deaths 
are so common that one newspaper lists them, like movie starting times, in a 
standing column titled "The Toll." 
</P>
<P>
 The Trade Center blast was spectacular, but it was also just one of 30,000 
cases of workplace violence last year, just one of 2,200 bombings. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks and months after Feb. 26, there were plenty of other violent 
diversions: The catastrophe at the Branch Davidian compound in Texas; the 
arrest of a Long Island man who allegedly murdered a string of prostitutes; the 
murder of six people by a gunman who opened fire on a Long Island commuter 
train at rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Will what the government calls "the single most devastating terror attack ever 
committed on American soil" eventually fade from memory? High school students 
still learn of the "Palmer raid" roundups of suspected subversives in 1920, but 
not the bomb that killed 30 people on Wall Street in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like throwing a rock in a pond," said Brian Jenkins of Kroll, the 
security consulting firm. "A big splash, but the ripples dissipate." 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts, however, still think the Trade Center blast marked a turn for 
the worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact there haven't been any more attacks doesn't mean we're out of the 
woods," said Hoffman of RAND. "Terrorism doesn't work in a predictable fashion. 
It may be another year before a new one in the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
 The attack, he says, remains a landmark of "the amateurization of terrorism"; 
it showed that amateurs using ordinary materials could have an extraordinary 
impact in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Any terrorism forecast based on the Trade Center is undercut by the fact that, 
after a four-month trial with 207 prosecution witnesses and 1,003 exhibits, "we 
still don't know the big picture," Hoffman said. "Was a foreign government 
behind it? If so, why?" 
</P>
<P>
 Good questions. But in the meantime, there is so much else to worry about.

RICH CANDIDATE STRESSES HUMBLE ROOTS IN AD; POLITICS: REPUBLICAN MICHAEL 
HUFFINGTON TRIES TO DEFUSE ISSUE OF HIS WEALTH. HE POINTS TO 'HARD WORK AND 
LUCK' AS A BUSINESSMAN WITHOUT MENTIONING FAMILY FORTUNE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Michael Huffington, one of the wealthiest members of Congress, tells 
voters in a television commercial introducing his Republican bid for the U.S. 
Senate that his roots are in a middle-class childhood and public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Barbara freshman congressman also attributes his financial success 
to "hard work and luck" as a businessman without mentioning that his fortune 
was made through the sale of a family-owned Texas oil company started by his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
 "With hard work and luck I succeeded in business," Huffington says in the ad. 
"I didn't grow up rich. We were middle class. I went to public schools, then 
Stanford." 
</P>
<P>
 The ad is the second of a series in which the little-known congressman has 
spent his own money to introduce his campaign to win the Republican nomination 
and then try to unseat Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein. The chief purpose of 
the ad seems to be to address an issue that is certain to come up during the 
campaign: his wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, 44, spent more than $5 million of his money to win his first race 
for Congress in 1992, more than any House candidate in history. A similar 
effort may be in store for California as he plans to spend millions of his 
personal funds on the Senate campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 His critics say he is an inexperienced legislator whose money is the only 
factor that makes him an instant contender for statewide office. 
</P>
<P>
 "He speaks for no one but himself and it's a total offense to the democratic 
process that an individual would have the gall to try and buy a seat in the 
United States Senate," said former congressman William E. Dannemeyer, who will 
face Huffington in the June 7 Republican primary. "A representative should seek 
. . . broad support from a cross-section of California and demonstrate 
viability as a candidate rather than just buy his way into the legislative 
arena." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said the commercial is his attempt to deal with the issue before 
opponents are able to define him for voters. The commercial began airing 
Friday. Campaign officials declined to say how long it will air or how much 
will be spent on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people have not (heard the criticism), but enough people have to where 
I'm just going to set the record straight this time without waiting for 
(Feinstein) to try and make me something that I'm not," he said. "Feinstein, 
who is reputedly one of the wealthiest people in the Senate, has already talked 
about this in letters." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has declined to disclose his personal wealth, although the Forbes 
magazine list of the 400 wealthiest Americans estimated that his father, Roy, 
is worth about $390 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Friday, Huffington defended his claim that he earned his 
fortune even though it came from a family-owned company. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents are very much alive and well and they still have all of their 
money," he said. "They have not passed it onto somebody. . . . Basically, I 
worked my butt off. My father paid for my education and after that he said: 
'You're on your own.' " 
</P>

 Huffington said he bought a share of the family company with money he made 
from an investment banking business he sold in 1976. He said he bought 
additional shares in Roy M. Huffington Inc. during the 12 years he worked as a 
vice president, chief financial officer and vice chairman under his father, who 
was chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 The family business was sold in 1990 to a Taiwanese oil company for an 
undisclosed sum, although industry officials have estimated its assets at $700 
million to $900 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's father is also a major contributor to the Republican Party. In 
1990, he was appointed U.S. ambassador to Austria by President George Bush.

ON CALIFORNIA: SKATEGATE: A SUNNIER PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just because we live in a sunny land, where kids skate mainly on Rollerblades 
and standard-issue winter storms are covered on the tube as running calamities 
. . . just because we are Californians, this doesn't mean we haven't kept up 
with Tonya and Nancy. In fact, California can bring something to Skategate. 
It's not forensic evidence or geographic connections -- although Hollywood 
certainly is destined to become the serial's last venue. It is perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 Out here, we understand the Tonya Hardings. Our history books are full of such 
people. Our streets, libraries, universities and towns are named after them. 
America is defined less by borders than by movement, the journey from Point A 
to Point B. Point B is where we live, on the Pacific shore, and characters like 
Tonya Harding are who got us here. We live in a taken land. The natives didn't 
offer up the West; it was taken. Mexico didn't give California to John C. 
Fremont; it was taken. Owens Valley didn't give away the water that built Los 
Angeles; it was taken. The railroad tycoons, the gold miners, the barons of the 
San Joaquin Valley; takers all. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the earlier historians dolled it up as best they could, this taking 
was never pretty, never fair, never matched such a lofty phrase as Manifest 
Destiny . It was crude, rough, bloody business: Many a knee got whacked on the 
old Santa Fe and Oregon trails. 
</P>
<P>
 Which takes us back to Tonya. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There seems to be, among some people anyway, a reservoir of equivocal, 
ill-defined empathy for Harding. It doesn't always show up in polls. When 
pollsters come calling, people will say that they recycle plastics, vote every 
Tuesday and abhor knee-whackers. And it's not simply a matter of supporting due 
process and presumed innocence. Nonetheless, talk to friends and neighbors 
informally, and many will confess to a fascination, if not support, for 
Harding. They will add quickly that they don't know why. Here's one theory: 
</P>
<P>
 Harding is a throwback. We didn't think they made 'em like her anymore. The 
pioneer days are done, and there is nowhere left to push, and idled we worry 
about growing soft, losing the edges, becoming a nation of occupants and 
victims. There is nothing soft about Tonya Harding. She smokes, drinks, shoots 
pool, keeps bad company, and makes her plans. 
</P>
<P>
 If she indeed did what many people suspect she did, and maybe even if she 
didn't, Harding is a classic taker. When she says from Lillehammer that she 
wants a gold medal and is "going to get it," period, it reminds me of what 
William Mulholland said as the first water he finagled from the Owens Valley 
splashed down the aqueduct. "There it is," he said. "Take it." And while we no 
longer approve of our forebears' tactics, we certainly have stuck around to 
enjoy the results, no? 
</P>
<P>
 Say what you will of the western pioneers, they knew what they were after, and 
how to get it. Audacity was not an issue. Consider the outrageous, complex 
waterworks and cultivated deserts and coastal municipalities that now define 
California. I doubt much of it would be attempted today, let alone 
accomplished. Similarly, it seems inconceivable that anyone today would be so 
fixated on Olympic victory that she could conspire to wound a rival. 
</P>
<P>
 But here we are, the sons and daughters of takers, and there she is, without 
apologies, sharing the practice rink in Lillehammer with Kerrigan. "Harding," 
went a New York Times account Friday, "seemed much less inhibited than Kerrigan 
about where she could go. There was something primal about the way Harding 
staked out every corner of the rink." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Which takes us to Kerrigan. Whack them hard enough, and some people will admit 
to an uneasiness about Kerrigan. As with Harding, they can't explain it. 
Certainly Kerrigan projects what we'd prefer to imagine we've become, in our 
post-taking period -- civilized, demure, graceful. But she also represents an 
American type as modern as Harding's is antique: a victim. Someone in the wrong 
place, at the wrong time; videotape to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 No, she didn't ask for it. "Why me?" she wailed. The attack, though, has made 
her golden. Kerrigan can belly-flop this week, and Wheaties still will put her 
on the box, Hollywood still will come a-knocking. She's won, in the new 
American way, and that's . . . nice, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe in the end, what Tonya and Nancy have done is push to a point of comic 
clarity a conflict in the national soul -- the struggle between what we were 
and what we have become, the grappling that follows from the unpleasant 
knowledge of what it took to get from Point A to Point B. An alternative view 
is that it's only figure skating.

CHURCH IS RIGHT UP THEIR ALLEY; BLACK CONGREGATION FLOURISHES IN IRVINE DESPITE 
SHARING LOCATION WITH BOWLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOREEN CARVAJAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One floor removed from the rumble of bowling balls and the crack of tenpins 
lies the quaint, little chapel of Irvine Lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 No steeple marks the Church of Christ Our Redeemer AME, which also lacks a 
public sign or a listing in the telephone book. Yet its windowless, 
second-story sacristy is filled with a young flock singing "We Shall Overcome" 
while struggling to ignore the occasional faint scent of sweat socks and old 
beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a year ago, this congregation had dwindled to the size of the original 
apostles, a chorus of voices so faint that the forlorn music made the church 
pianist want to weep. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came a preacher from Los Angeles with a mission to build up the lone 
black church in the sprawling southern suburbs of Orange County, which has a 
small, dispersed African American population. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we're meeting in a bowling alley," said the new church pastor, 
the Rev. Douglas M. Patterson Sr., "we're still in a place of worship. We have 
our prayer and we realize God can come to us in any place." 
</P>
<P>
 God may find them anywhere, but this is the only place among tranquil suburban 
neighborhoods and grassy office parks where black church members can glance 
around the room and see themselves in the majority, greeting each other without 
introduction as "Sister" or "Brother." 
</P>
<P>
 The Church of Christ Our Redeemer has managed to flourish despite the 
unheavenly ambience of the bowling alley, a history of internal dissension and 
meager resources. 
</P>
<P>
 When the worshipers walk past the bowlers on the first floor and climb to 
Redeemer's door, they leave behind a suburban world that is occasionally 
lonely, often friendly and sometimes hostile to the 42,000 black residents who 
make up a little more than 2% of Orange County's population. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came from a big Los Angeles church where we had some 10,000 members, three 
services a day," Patterson said. "Then I come here about a year ago to Orange 
County, to a church where there are 12 people, no piano and no choir." 
</P>
<P>
 Two centuries ago, Richard Allen, the founder of the African Methodist 
Episcopal Church, launched the worldwide denomination from a Philadelphia 
blacksmith's shop with an anvil for an altar. 
</P>
<P>
 So, too, has Patterson improvised with taped music and a donated piano, 
borrowed chairs and a portable communion rail. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, Patterson will slip in his sermons, referring to the hymnals 
stored in "your pews" -- actually padded chairs. Like Patterson, members 
overlook these earthly matters of style, ignoring the fact that their church's 
most distinctive architectural feature is fluorescent lights instead of arched 
stained glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, Patterson's steady baritone singing voice and generous ration of hugs 
seem to transform the bowling alley conference room. "You are at home here," he 
said, stretching both hands toward two strangers. "You are ours. You are from 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent 11 a.m. Sunday service, Patterson bounded into the room with a 
bright orange kente cloth hanging loosely against his black robes and a crisp 
white handkerchief in his hand. His smile never wavered as he intoned the words 
of the national Negro anthem, "Lift Every Voice and Sing," urging the nearly 40 
worshipers to extend a handshake in greeting their seatmates. 
</P>
<P>
 More often, they embraced. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, the AME network has provided shelter for the black community 
since the original church, Mother Bethel, was a northern way station for slaves 
seeking escape on the Underground Railroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanessa Ashford Bussey, a recent Irvine transplant whose family boasts three 
generations of South Carolina AME ministers, offers a one-word description of 
the church: family. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I found the church in Irvine I was so happy, being a traditional 
Southerner," said Bussey, 35. "The warmth of the church made a big difference. 
For one thing, it let me know there were more African Americans in the area. I 
had seen some here and there, but scattered. . . . It gives you a sense of 
belonging. I found African American friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Many church members had made a Sunday habit of commuting to black churches in 
Santa Ana, Long Beach, Los Angeles or San Diego until they found Irvine Lanes 
through friends or community advertisements. New church member Karen Mizell 
would drop off her two daughters at a church with a predominantly white 
congregation near their Irvine home, but she always politely declined 
invitations to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "That church is great," she said, "but I couldn't bring myself to go. I've 
never gone to white churches. I don't know if that should make a difference but 
it does." 
</P>
<P>
 A West Virginia native, Mizell grew up in the Baptist church with the rituals 
and gospel music that for centuries have provided a spiritual and cultural 
anchor for black worshipers. When she moved to Southern California from West 
Virginia four years ago she started searching for her community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of hard," Mizell said. "The first thing I wanted to do was to go 
to the black side of town. And my brother laughed at me. He said there's no 
such thing. It was like I had to get a shot. I had to be around my people." 
</P>
<P>
 Her daughters have mostly white friends because there are few black students 
in their school. When the girls entered the Christ Our Redeemer church, "they 
said, 'Mom, there's no white people,' " Mizell recalled. "And I said: 'It's 
because it's a black church.' And they asked me: 'What's a black church?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The roots of Christ Our Redeemer date back to 1991 when another AME minister, 
Linda Parker, started meeting on the campus of UC Irvine. That grew into a 
spiritual community of about 75 regulars who moved from a campus building to 
the conference room above the Irvine Lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came a period of internal strife, problems with administration and a 
debate over the size and goals of the church. 
</P>
<P>
 By the late summer of 1992, the church had dwindled to a loyal 12. For nearly 
four months they worshiped without a minister. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that a number of judgments were made that did not work out and the 
result was a personality clash," said AME Bishop Vinton Randolph Anderson, who 
presides over the 5th District that includes Irvine. "People also didn't have a 
great amount of stock in a room above a bowling alley. So they scattered." 
</P>
<P>
 So Anderson shifted Patterson, a former associate minister at the prominent 
First AME Church of Los Angeles, to Irvine to make sure the church kept its 
stake in southern Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, the congregation has been cautiously considering the notion of moving, 
perhaps sharing quarters with a Seventh-day Adventist church where members hold 
services on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the congregation of Christ Our Redeemer will continue to 
share praying space with bowling balls. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all," noted the bishop, "most of us forget that our mothers and fathers 
began their churches in their homes, in their dining rooms, in their living 
rooms. That's where the churches really began."

BODY OF CAL STATE STUDENT FOUND IN HER CAR TRUNK; INVESTIGATION: CATHY TORREZ, 
20, HAD DISAPPEARED AFTER LEAVING HER PART-TIME JOB A WEEK AGO, PROMPTING A 
COMMUNITYWIDE SEARCH. POLICE FOUND HER VEHICLE PARKED IN A PARKING LOT NEAR A 
HOSPITAL.

<P>
 Cal State Fullerton honor student Cathy Torrez, whose disappearance a week ago 
prompted a communitywide search, was found dead in her car early Saturday about 
a mile from the shopping center parking lot where she was last seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Police released little information Saturday, saying only that they were 
investigating Torrez's death as a homicide. City Administrator Robert D'Amato 
said officers patrolling a parking lot near a hospital early Saturday 
recognized the missing woman's vehicle and later discovered her body in the 
trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's arms showed signs of a struggle, D'Amato said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You expect the worst but you hope," said Albert Gonzales, a friend who acted 
as a spokesman for family members, who remained inside their home and declined 
comment Saturday. "There's just a lot of emotion. A lot of pain. Everyone is 
real distraught." 
</P>
<P>
 Torrez was last seen leaving a part-time job at Sav-On Drugs by a co-worker 
about 8 p.m. Feb. 12. At 7:50 p.m., she had called her mother from the store 
and said she would be home shortly. 
</P>
<P>
 The diminutive, 20-year-old woman, a junior sociology major who had made the 
honor roll last semester while holding down two part-time jobs, had wanted to 
become a social worker or a probation officer, family members said earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "She worked hard for everything she had," said Tracy Comer, 20, a sophomore at 
Cal State Fullerton who met Torrez in a Spanish class. 
</P>
<P>
 Police declined to discuss whether they have suspects in the case. An autopsy 
is scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and family had held out hope that Torrez was safe since her mother 
reported her missing last Saturday. They had papered north Orange County with 
flyers seeking information on her whereabouts. As late as Saturday morning, 
flyers were distributed at a conference at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who knew Torrez had said the 4-foot, 10-inch woman was not the type to 
go anywhere without informing her family. 
</P>
<P>
 News of Torrez's death shocked residents of the close-knit neighborhood off 
Chapman Avenue, where she had lived with her mother and stepfather, Mary and 
Ron Bennet, her brother and one of her two sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm numb right now," said Ken Luna, a neighbor. "We're waiting for answers. 
That's all I can say." 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Bernal, a neighbor whose daughter used to walk to nearby Valencia High 
School with Torrez, said he held out hope that she was alive until the end. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is surprised," Bernal said. "Even this morning when I heard it on 
the news, I was hoping it wasn't her." 
</P>
<P>
 Placentia police officers discovered Torrez's Toyota Corolla before 1:30 a.m. 
Saturday in a parking lot in front of medical offices near Placentia-Linda 
Community Hospital in the 1300 block of Rose Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "After searching the vehicle, the patrol officers located the body of Cathy 
Torrez," Placentia Sgt. Ken Gardner said. "The case is being treated as a 
homicide investigation."

MICHAEL APPEARS BRIEFLY AT 'JACKSON FAMILY HONORS' SHOW; ENTERTAINMENT: POP 
STAR PRESENTS AWARDS TO ELIZABETH TAYLOR AND MOTOWN RECORDS FOUNDER BERRY 
GORDY. 
</P>

<P>
 Billed as a humanitarian event, the "Jackson Family Honors" taping here 
Saturday had more of the feel of a TV melodrama. 
</P>
<P>
 The family's most famous member, beleaguered pop star Michael Jackson, 
appeared to be a reluctant participant in the more than two-hour production, 
and the family's most mercurial member, LaToya Jackson, contended that she was 
barred from the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of performing a solo number -- as did sister Janet Jackson, who 
received a standing ovation early in the evening -- Michael Jackson only agreed 
to present awards to close friend Elizabeth Taylor and Motown Records founder 
Berry Gordy. 
</P>
<P>
 His only scheduled musical contribution to the show was joining the family in 
a finale written for the event, which is to be broadcast Tuesday by NBC-TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the 35-year-old singer's photo had been featured prominently in ads 
for the reunion show, many in the near-capacity crowd at the 13,000-seat MGM 
Grand Garden arena had hoped for more music from him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole reason I paid $100 for a ticket was to see Michael perform, " Julie 
Marlowe, 24, said. "I thought this was supposed to be a concert." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this was the most high-profile U.S. stage appearance by Jackson since 
he was accused of sexual molestation by a 13-year-old boy in August, and most 
of the enthusiastic crowd was eager to show its support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always loved his music, and I wanted to show him we still care about 
him," said Maria Lopez, 26, after buying a $100 ticket Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson reportedly paid more than $10 million last month to settle the 
lawsuit. No criminal charges have been lodged against him. 
</P>
<P>
 During the playing of one of his videos to open the 8 p.m. show, the crowd 
shrieked in approval. The video showed Jackson performing the tune "Leave Me 
Alone," which was meant to mock his treatment by the tabloid press. 
</P>
<P>
 Backstage before presenting his first award, Jackson expressed gratitude for 
his fans' loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some friends are like shadows, you only see them when the sun shines," he 
said. "But my fans sustained me even in the dark days. I owe them everything." 
</P>
<P>
 On a less harmonious note, LaToya Jackson maintained earlier in the week that 
the family would not let her join the show unless she signed a gag order 
agreeing not to criticize Michael Jackson or the family any further. 
</P>
<P>
 At a morning news conference, Jermaine Jackson, the guiding force behind the 
TV special, and mother, Katherine, denied that a gag order had been demanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there had been rumors that LaToya Jackson might try to sneak into the 
concert in disguise, her husband, Jack Gordon, said Saturday that his wife had 
rejected the idea after he suggested it. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the focus on the Jackson family, Saturday's event was not designed 
as a Jackson reunion, Jermaine Jackson said. Instead, it was planned as an 
annual event to salute outstanding humanitarians and to raise money for 
charities. 
</P>
<P>
 About $500,000 is earmarked for charity, mostly for earthquake relief in 
California, said Jackson family representatives.

'BANDIT QUEEN' FREED IN INDIA AFTER 11 YEARS; JUSTICE: PHOOLAN DEVI WAS ACCUSED 
OF LEADING A MASSACRE OF 18 MEN BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN HER GANG 
RAPE. BUT SHE WAS NEVER TRIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 India's most celebrated female outlaw, horse-riding "bandit queen" Phoolan 
Devi, was released Saturday after 11 years in jail to the rapturous cheers of 
thousands who idolize her as a home-grown version of Robin Hood. 
</P>
<P>
 A career in politics may be next. 
</P>
<P>
 From her hide-out in the nearly inaccessible Chambal ravines of northern 
India, Phoolan, 37, was said to have sown terror with her seven-member gang 
throughout the states of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Police claim Phoolan became the bandits' ringleader after she was gang raped 
in her village of low-caste Hindus. To seek revenge, police allege, she led the 
killing of 18 men of high caste who were believed to have been involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoolan has always denied involvement, but that massacre in February, 1981, 
helped make her a hero among India's downtrodden, as did her adeptness at 
eluding police and reinforcements dispatched by the central government. 
</P>
<P>
 Wanted in 55 criminal cases on charges including murder, kidnaping and 
robbery, Phoolan gave herself up in February, 1983, after negotiating the terms 
of her surrender. One condition was that she not be sent to Uttar Pradesh, 
where she feared she would be killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind bars, Phoolan continued to be lionized by India's poorest, who saw in 
her the personification of resistance against the injustices of the caste 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoolan was supposed to serve eight years in jail but ended up spending 11. 
The Supreme Court on Friday ordered her paroled, and the beaming round-faced 
woman, dressed in a sari, walked free from New Delhi's Tis Hazari court after 
posting a bond worth $1,620. 
</P>
<P>
 The waiting crowd roared its support. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoolan's break came when a coalition dominated by lower-caste Hindus was 
elected to power in Uttar Pradesh last November. In an apparent move to please 
the people who voted for him, the state's chief minister, Mulayam Singh Yadav, 
announced Jan. 20 that his state would withdraw all charges against Phoolan. 
</P>
<P>
 The abiding importance of caste in Indian politics -- and the durability of 
Phoolan's image as a champion of the social underdog -- sent several of India's 
parties racing to her jail cell as her release loomed. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoolan made a cryptic remark that some observers took to mean that she is 
serious about trying her hand at politics. Asked where she will be residing, 
the accused highwaywoman said, "I will live in the entire country."

MILITANTS ATTACK EGYPTIAN TRAIN, WOUND 4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services

<TEXT>
<P>
 Muslim militants attacked a luxury-train sleeping car in central Egypt early 
Saturday, wounding four people and striking a new blow at the country's tourist 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The militant group Gamaa al Islamiya, or Islamic Group, said it carried out 
the attack as "swift retribution" for the recent sentencing to death of an army 
officer and two conscripts charged with mining an airstrip close to the Libyan 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement to an international news agency, the group said that the men, 
whom it called "heroes," were members who were charged with attempting to 
assassinate President Hosni Mubarak by blowing up the airstrip at Sidi Barrani. 
</P>
<P>
 The strip is often used by Mubarak or by ministers who stop there before 
driving into Libya in compliance with the U.N. ban on flights to that country. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gamaa, which said another three of its members were sentenced to 10 years' 
hard labor, threatened further action if the condemned men are executed. 
</P>
<P>
 In Saturday morning's attack, about six men opened fire on the sleeper as the 
Cairo-to-Aswan express, headed for Luxor and the ancient capital of the 
pharaohs, passed through the village of Baqur south of Asyut. The side of the 
car was riddled with bullets, and some windows shattered. 
</P>
<P>
 An Egyptian woman was wounded in the thigh by a bullet. The other victims -- a 
female architect from Poland, a female student from Taiwan and an Egyptian man 
-- were cut by flying glass or shrapnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Security sources said some spent cartridges found at the scene were inscribed 
with slogans like "Islam is coming" and "Revenge for our martyrs." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Asyut, speaking on condition of anonymity, said police had made 
11 arrests, all suspected militants. 
</P>
<P>
 Egyptian militants have previously opened fire on tour buses and Nile 
cruisers, but Saturday's attack was the first on a train frequented by 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third attack on foreigners in a week but the first this year in 
which foreigners have been injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Some foreign workers left Asyut on Thursday after extremists fired on a bus 
carrying Romanian workers. No one was injured in that attack, also claimed by 
the Gamaa al Islamiya. In addition, the group claimed responsibility for shots 
fired at a Nile cruiser just north of Asyut on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 people have died since extremists launched a violent campaign two 
years ago to topple Egypt's secularist government.

BRITAIN, IRELAND NOT DISSUADED ON ULSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The British and Irish governments agreed Saturday that Sinn Fein's failure to 
accept their offer of negotiations will not stop the search for compromise in 
Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 British Prime Minister John Major and his Irish counterpart, Albert Reynolds, 
told reporters outside Major's 10 Downing St. residence that their priority now 
is to start fresh talks with moderate parties in the British province. 
</P>
<P>
 The two leaders continue to fan hopes of attaining the big goal: a permanent 
Irish Republican Army cease-fire to pave the way for Sinn Fein, the IRA's 
political wing, to join peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Major, Reynolds and key aides discussed their Northern Ireland initiative for 
75 minutes before going together to an Ireland-England rugby match. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting underscored their determination to speak with one voice on 
Northern Ireland and to maintain pressure on Sinn Fein, which will hold its 
annual conference next weekend in Dublin, to reject IRA violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds and Major on Dec. 15 announced that renouncing violence was necessary 
for Sinn Fein to be included in negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., Reynolds said he thinks 
that the Sinn Fein-IRA leadership cannot agree on what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "For them to come to a decision of historic proportions will inevitably take 
time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRA so far has signaled no change. Hours before Major and Reynolds met, a 
firebomb destroyed a newspaper vendor's shop and damaged six other stores in 
central London. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but police suspected the IRA. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence in Northern Ireland has continued at a relatively low but lethal 
clip. Last week, the IRA attacked several army and police patrols, killing one 
policeman Thursday in a rocket attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Protestant gunmen determined to preserve British rule wounded a 52-year-old 
Roman Catholic man and twice struck Sinn Fein's west Belfast headquarters -- 
first with a rocket, then with gunfire that injured three workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Major and Reynolds believe British-Irish solidarity will gradually undermine 
the IRA justification for violence -- that Britain holds Northern Ireland 
against the will of most Irish people. 
</P>
<P>
 Their Dec. 15 "framework for peace" committed both governments to support any 
compromise formula that most Northern Ireland citizens would accept, ranging 
from continued British rule to union with the Irish republic.

CLINTON SHRUGS OFF ALLEGED DEATH THREAT, GOES JOGGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of an alleged threat on his life, President Clinton, wearing a 
black T-shirt captioned "In the Line of Fire" above gray cross hairs on the 
back, jogged Saturday in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton ran a circuitous route, at one point ducking into an alley with his 
motorcade in tow only to find a dead end. 
</P>
<P>
 With a sheepish grin, he turned around and threaded his way back through the 
Secret Service vehicles and press vans as they were trying to untangle 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's run came after an unemployed limousine driver, Ronald Gene 
Barbour, 45, of Orlando, Fla., was arrested on a federal charge of threatening 
to kill Clinton during one of his morning workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbour was being held without bond Saturday in the Seminole County Jail in 
Sanford, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 A Washington television station reported that Barbour was in the capital area 
Jan. 11-17. Citing unnamed sources, the station said Barbour planned to shoot 
Clinton during one of his runs on the Mall. Clinton was in Europe at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbour, in a telephone interview Saturday, described himself as a "harmless 
little fuzz ball" who planned to take his own life, not the President's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't harbor that kind of feeling for anybody," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbour, who says he has been a manic-depressive for 14 years, said he does 
not remember making the threats, though he had told friends he didn't like 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Barbour's neighbors called authorities after Barbour talked about the 
plot, the Secret Service told the Orlando Sentinel.

SUMMIT OF BLACK LEADERS INCLUDING FARRAKHAN PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The NAACP said Saturday it will host a national summit of black leaders that 
will, for the first time, include controversial Nation of Islam leader Louis 
Farrakhan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have every right to convene African American leadership," NAACP Executive 
Director Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. said. "There's a deep hunger in our community." 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis and national board Chairman William Gibson announced the decision 
during the group's annual board meeting. Both men said they will proceed with 
the summit despite concern among Jewish groups over Farrakhan's involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither would say whether they were under pressure from the Anti-Defamation 
League of B'nai B'rith to distance themselves from Farrakhan because of his 
past anti-Semitic statements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Civil rights is a business where you have to deal with people pressuring you 
every day," Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview from New Orleans, ADL National Director Abraham 
Foxman said his group did not ask the National Assn. for the Advancement of 
Colored People to ostracize Farrakhan from black leadership as a condition of 
their own discussions, held last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But Foxman added that he hopes other black activists will address Farrakhan's 
"racism and anti-Semitism" during the summit. 
</P>
<P>
 If it comes off, the meeting would mark the first time in more than a decade 
that black activists have united around a common purpose. The last time was 
1979, when several black leaders met in New York over Andrew Young's removal as 
ambassador to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 No date was announced for the summit. Five cities are under consideration as 
possible sites, Chavis said. He did not name them. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the meeting will be a follow-up to a unity pledge made by Chavis, 
Farrakhan and other prominent African Americans at a September forum in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 This effort comes on the heels of offensive statements by Farrakhan aide 
Khalid Abdul Muhammad, and Farrakhan's refusal to denounce Muhammad for the 
sake of moving into the mainstream.

PROPOSED TAX BREAK FOR THE POOR DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GUY GUGLIOTTA, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A White House working group debating the Clinton Administration's new homeless 
policy has discarded a proposal to allow poor people to take a tax deduction 
for housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Interagency Council on the Homeless met this past week to discuss changes 
to a draft document circulated privately among the council's 16 member agencies 
and other interested organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft, titled "Priority: Home! The Federal Plan to End Homelessness, 
Building a Comprehensive Solution," proposes a "continuum of care" approach, 
which goes beyond emergency treatment to encompass treatment, training and 
education programs for the homeless, leading to eventual re-integration into 
the larger society. 
</P>
<P>
 "Government must address the needs of at-risk families and individuals 
vulnerable to 'crisis poverty,' " the draft said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the same time, it must attend to the more complex situation of those who 
also suffer from disabling conditions, the 'chronically disabled.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The report was produced by the council with participation by member agencies. 
However, knowledgeable sources said that it was largely prepared at the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development by the office of Andrew Cuomo, 
HUD's assistant secretary for community planning and development. 
</P>
<P>
 At this past week's "clearance meeting," agencies were invited to suggest 
changes in the draft document. While the underlying principles remained intact, 
the sources said, many agencies sought to make sure their own programs were 
included in a reworked report expected to be circulated this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The council members also agreed that the final report needed a larger 
discussion of the nature and numbers of homeless populations. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft made use of a 1992 study suggesting that 7 million Americans were 
homeless "at some time" during a five-year period. This contrasts with 
"snapshot" surveys putting the homeless population at 600,000 to 800,000 on any 
given night. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources said the council torpedoed a HUD proposal to allow poor people to 
take a low-income housing tax deduction as a means to augment disposable 
income. 
</P>
<P>
 The deduction would be prohibitively expensive and impossible to enact, the 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were also ruffled feathers among some council members who felt that HUD 
was controlling the plan, which was requested by President Clinton in an 
executive order last May, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Interagency Council was moved to the White House from HUD last October to 
serve as a working group under the President's Domestic Policy Council. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear from the draft document what the chain of command will be 
between the Interagency Council, HUD and the respective agencies when the time 
comes to implement the final proposal.

U.S. DEALT SETBACK IN EFFORTS TO SEEK OVERALL PEACE ACCORD IN BOSNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is attempting to move beyond the cease-fire in 
Sarajevo to negotiate a peace agreement for all of Bosnia-Herzegovina, but its 
initial efforts have failed to produce the quick results some officials hoped 
for, aides said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department's special envoy, Charles E. Redman, went to Sarajevo last 
week to ask the Muslim-led Bosnian government to provide its "bottom line" 
terms for a final settlement, but the divided Bosnians said they were not ready 
to make a proposal, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Muslims have reopened some issues that the Administration thought 
were already solved -- and suggested that they may demand more territory than 
the 33.3% of Bosnia-Herzegovina they agreed to last year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Bosnian military commanders have even argued that the government should 
take advantage of Western threats of force against their adversaries, the 
Bosnian Serbs, and mount a new offensive on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 These complications have dealt a setback to the Administration's hopes that 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's threat of air strikes against the 
Bosnian Serbs around Sarajevo could produce new momentum toward an overall 
settlement of the 22-month-long Bosnian war. 
</P>
<P>
 And they have raised the paradoxical prospect that the United States, after 
setting out to help the Bosnian Muslims defend their interests, may begin to 
think of them as too stubborn in their demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any sense that they are on the verge of announcing a draft 
settlement," State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The peace process is moving, but it's not going to happen instantly," a 
senior State Department official said. "The Bosnians are divided over what to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Another senior official, asked how long the Administration's peace initiative 
will need before it shows results, said: "We're talking about months." 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia's ambassador to the United Nations, Muhamed Sacirbey, said he was 
certain his government would opt for a negotiated peace over continuing the 
war. "We are committed to the peace track," he said. But he added that it would 
take time to settle on the "bottom line." Sacirbey confirmed that the Bosnian 
Muslims may ask for more than the 33.3% of Bosnia that they accepted in 
negotiations last year. "The limit of 33.3% is an open issue because so many 
other questions are open," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. official said: "That's in the middle of the negotiations that are going 
on right now." The Muslim-led Bosnian government now holds less than 20% of the 
country's territory, and giving them even 33.3% would require that the Bosnian 
Serbs turn over large areas that they have taken by force. 
</P>
<P>
 In part because of the Bosnians' delay in coming up with a peace proposal, the 
Administration may take a more active role in offering suggestions for the 
shape of a settlement, one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a sensitive point for President Clinton and Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, for they have repeatedly pledged that the United States would not 
pressure the Bosnian Muslims, as victims of aggression, to accept any 
particular outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, however, senior State Department officials have already settled 
privately on what they see as a realistic outcome to the war -- an outcome many 
Bosnians would view as unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department officials said the elements of a realistic settlement 
appear to include: 
</P>
<P>
 * A three-way partition of Bosnia according to the formula worked out in 
U.N.-sponsored talks last year, giving 49% to the Serbs, 33.3% to the Muslims 
and 17.5% to the Croats. 
</P>
<P>
 * An exchange of territory under which the Muslims would give up three 
besieged towns in eastern Bosnia -- Srebrenica, Zepa and Gorazde -- in exchange 
for land around Sarajevo. The Bosnian government has rejected this, demanding 
that the three enclaves be linked to Sarajevo with protected roads across 
Serbian territory. 
</P>
<P>
 * A loose confederation that would leave open the possibility that Bosnia's 
Serbian and Croatian areas would unify with Serbia and Croatia -- another 
outcome the government has rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 In part to nudge all three factions toward a settlement, senior U.S., European 
and Russian officials may meet in Europe this week "to focus on what a likely 
package looks like," a senior State Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic plans to come to 
Washington in hopes of determining how much the Bosnians can ask for and still 
enjoy U.S. support. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials insist that they will not pressure the Muslims to 
accept anything. However, they acknowledge that they have let the Bosnians know 
-- gently -- that the United States will not support them forever if they 
refuse a settlement that is reasonable in American eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture is further complicated by the suddenly renewed enthusiasm of 
Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin for a major role in the negotiations. 
Russian nationalists have complained that the West was victimizing the Serbs, 
who like most Russians are Eastern Orthodox Christians; and Yeltsin has 
responded by promising to protect the Serbs' interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sense of Yeltsin's letter (to Clinton last week) was: 'You've got your 
dog in this fight and we've got ours -- but where during the Cold War that 
would have put us on opposite sides, this time we're in cahoots, trying to get 
everybody to agree to a settlement,' " a senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only problem is that the Serbs don't need a good deal. The Serbs already 
have a good deal. . . . So there's a bit of a dysfunction there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If negotiations do progress, the Administration will face another problem that 
officials don't like to talk about: Carrying out a peace agreement will require 
money and troops. Clinton has promised to provide as many as 15,000 U.S. 
peacekeeping troops if a settlement is reached -- but his eagerness to send 
them may fade rapidly as the November congressional elections approach.

ALLIED COMMANDERS FACE DAUNTING TASK; MILITARY: AN AMERICAN OFFICER AND A 
BRITON WILL COORDINATE ANY AIR STRIKES. THEY CONFRONT EACH OTHER, THEIR 
SUPERIORS -- AND SERBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If the United States and its NATO allies launch air strikes against the 
Bosnian Serbs, U.S. Adm. Jeremy Boorda and British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose are 
likely to end up as the men in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the Serbs fail to comply with today's 4 p.m. Pacific time deadline to 
remove their artillery from within a 12-mile radius of Sarajevo or turn it over 
to U.N. peacekeeping troops, Rose, a British special forces commander in charge 
of U.N. troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina, will make the initial recommendations on 
whether to begin the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The blunt-spoken Boorda commands the NATO air armada that would carry them 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are widely recognized as competent, decisive officers with proven combat 
records. Rose secured the orderly surrender of the Falkland Islands by the 
invading Argentines in the 1982 war. Boorda has run the NATO operation 
enforcing a U.N.-imposed "no-fly" zone over Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 But military experts say their biggest frustrations are likely to come when 
they attempt to get their respective organizations to agree clearly on what the 
allied forces should do in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their biggest challenge will be in dealing with the NATO command structure 
and the U.N. command structure -- particularly with those who are making the 
political and diplomatic decisions," said retired U.S. Marine Lt. Gen. Bernard 
E. Trainor. "The military action will be fairly straightforward." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, bureaucratic entanglements already have clouded the allied operation 
in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 In a major embarrassment, the two organizations split sharply last week over 
what it would take for the Serbs to meet the NATO deadline. The North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization said the Serbs must move their artillery 12 miles from 
Sarajevo, while U.N. commanders insisted that they could keep their guns in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose and Boorda have since worked out a compromise, but they were forced to 
negotiate amid a raft of second-guessing -- and conflicting signals -- by 
political officials, which some analysts said could give the Serbs just the 
opening they needed to equivocate. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding the difficulty of coordinating any military action, insiders say, 
are the two leaders' decidedly different operating styles. They diverge 
markedly in their views on the use of force, a factor that could heighten 
tensions even further. 
</P>
<P>
 The 54-year-old Rose, a tall, lean, smooth-talking, Oxford-educated infantry 
officer with an old-school charm and a penchant for the unusual, is known as a 
risk-taker who often comes up with creative solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 At the peak of the Falklands War, for example, after leading a series of 
commando raids against enemy troops, he used psychological warfare to help 
bring about a settlement, once breaking into a radio program to deliver a 
message to Argentine military leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years before, he had won a reputation for derring-do in a rescue of 19 
hostages who were being held during a siege at the Iranian Embassy in London. 
The dramatic gun battle, waged by Rose's black-hooded Special Air Service 
soldiers, was carried live on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Boorda, 55, a short, stocky, pipe-smoking, high school dropout 
who joined the Navy -- illegally -- at age 16 and rose to destroyer captain, is 
a quintessential policy-maker and planner. 
</P>
<P>
 Although both have made the obligatory assertions that the West will launch 
air strikes if the Serbs do not obey allied orders, Rose -- in a move that 
appears to be out of character -- seems to have sought to avoid armed 
confrontation, even at the risk of undercutting the NATO ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
 Early this week, he initially dismissed NATO demands that the Serbs obey the 
NATO ultimatum to the letter, then blithely reversed himself after the United 
States -- and other key NATO governments -- reacted in horror. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials are convinced that once the deadline has passed, Rose will do 
everything possible to avert ordering air strikes, as long as the Serbs provide 
him with even the slightest excuse to say that they are cooperating. 
</P>
<P>
 Boorda, on the other hand, is a disciple of the hard-line U.S. doctrine that 
says once the allies have threatened to employ military force, they should not 
hesitate to do it with sufficient power to uphold their credibility. And he has 
said so several times in public. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides their significant policy differences, the two men also must contend 
with the continuing split between NATO and the United Nations over how to 
handle the situation in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. policy-makers, more reluctant to use force on general principle, are 
especially wary in this case because the United Nations has about 13,000 
peacekeeping troops on the ground -- British, French, Canadian, Spanish and 
Dutch -- who would be vulnerable to retaliation if the Serbs became angered. 
</P>
<P>
 Since these same countries are key powers in NATO, the alliance is split 
internally -- a factor that has influenced both bodies' deliberations for 
months. While some NATO countries are loath to launch air strikes, others 
support them, if only to bolster NATO's credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating the overall situation is the fact that the Serbs and Muslims -- 
much like the Iraqis -- are masters at testing allied resolve. They move to 
within inches of a Western-set line in the sand and then pull back before NATO 
can muster the will to act. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say that, in turn, is likely to make clear-cut decisions even more 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Boorda and Rose are not the first military officers to experience 
problems with their political bosses. French Gen. Jean Cot, commander of U.N. 
forces in the former Yugoslav federation, has been cut out of the 
decision-making in Bosnia. Although not yet relieved by his successor, he has 
been fired for criticizing U.N. control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have spent a good part of my energy preserving my freedom of action (from 
the constraints of the U.N. bureaucracy) to the detriment of my essential 
mission," he wrote in a still-unreleased departure letter to U.N. Secretary 
General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rose-Boorda relationship may not have to weather more than a couple of 
weeks. The admiral has been tapped to succeed Adm. Frank B. Kelso II as U.S. 
chief of naval operations and will be leaving his NATO post in mid-March. Rose 
will stay on indefinitely.

NEWS ANALYSIS; AFTER AIR STRIKES, NATO WOULD NEVER BE SAME; BOSNIA: THE FIRST 
SALVO WOULD CHANGE THE NATURE, STRUCTURE AND SCOPE OF THE ALLIANCE, SENIOR 
OFFICERS SAY. IT WAS CONCEIVED AS A DEFENSIVE PARTNERSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 While diplomats wrangled and snow fell on anguished Sarajevo last week, NATO 
planners here wrote combat orders for a mission that would launch the 16-nation 
alliance into uncharted waters. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S.-West European partnership that stared down the Soviet bear for over 40 
years without firing a shot prepared with exquisite detail to unleash a 
fearsome armada of planes against any Serbian gun positions still besieging the 
Bosnian capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Their first salvo would change the nature, the structure and the scope of the 
alliance that won the Cold War, senior officers say. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO forces poised this morning on three aircraft carriers in the Adriatic and 
bases in Italy are meant to be intimidating. They are also deadly. The outcome 
is not at issue if the jets fly against the guns once a get-out-of-town 
ultimatum expires at 4 p.m. Pacific time today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather have my job than the job of a ground commander who was trying to 
shoot artillery at Sarajevo, or to hide," said U.S. Adm. Jeremy Boorda, who 
commands NATO's southern forces at their headquarters here in the gritty Naples 
suburb of Bagnoli. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid NATO attack, the warring sides must have surrendered their heavy 
weapons or have removed them 12 miles from the city by the deadline. For the 
last three days, they appear to have been making an effort to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Boorda's confidence in an interview last week was echoed by NATO officers here 
who were struck by the unprecedented role that the alliance had accepted: armed 
guarantor of the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been nothing like this for over four decades of NATO," one senior 
officer said on condition of anonymity. "And the difference is even greater for 
the Americans. Having delegated authority, the White House and the Pentagon 
remain vital participants, but they're not the principal actors once shooting 
begins." 
</P>
<P>
 Air strikes by U.S., French, British and Dutch jets representing an alliance 
born in the shards of World War II would stir immediate international echoes 
both novel and far-reaching. 
</P>
<P>
 They would signal: 
</P>
<P>
 * NATO's first resort to violence. 
</P>
<P>
 * An offensive strike by an alliance conceived and grown to maturity as a 
defensive partnership to guard against outside aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 * The use of offensive violence outside the territory of one of its members, 
never contemplated by NATO founders. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as groundbreaking to American officers here at a polyglot base where 
partners' uniforms are as different as the cultures they represent is that 
Bosnia has forced the jettisoning of a hallowed military principle. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no Stormin' Norman this time; there's no unity of command," said an 
American officer who remembers allied commander Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf from 
the 1991 Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, the Bosnia collaboration between the United Nations and the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization hinges on a dual, parallel command structure. 
</P>
<P>
 On the U.N. side, authority runs down from Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali to Yasushi Akashi, the U.N. special representative for the former 
Yugoslav republics. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi coordinates with French Gen. Jean Cot, commander of the peacekeeping 
U.N. Protection Force for the former Yugoslav federation. From his headquarters 
in Zagreb, Croatia, the French officer confers with British Lt. Gen. Michael 
Rose, the U.N. commander in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 On the NATO side, Secretary General Manfred Woerner, a German, sits atop the 
North Atlantic Council, the alliance's highest political body. The council 
agreed last April to enforce a much-ignored U.N. ban on fixed-wing flights over 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO Operation Deny Flight began April 12, 1993, with U.S. Air Force and Navy 
jets first among alliance equals over Bosnian skies -- as they would be in any 
attacks. In June, NATO foreign ministers agreed to provide close air support to 
U.N. troops in Bosnia if requested. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting within the framework of U.N. resolutions, in August the NATO council 
ordered planning for air strikes to break the Bosnian Serb stranglehold on 
Sarajevo, and for possible action against large-scale interference with 
humanitarian assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. commanders have so far not asked for that intervention, but in January, 
NATO heads of government, President Clinton among them, affirmed their 
readiness to use force under authority of the U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 9, the NATO council authorized Boorda as commander of Allied Forces 
Southern Europe to mount air strikes at U.N. request against artillery or 
mortar positions around Sarajevo responsible for attacks on civilians. It also 
set the 1 a.m. Monday Sarajevo time deadline in coordination with the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly air-to-air fighters at the start of Deny Flight, NATO aircraft are by 
now strongly reinforced with fighter-bombers, attack planes and gunships for 
close air support. The NATO air force is commanded by U.S. Lt. Gen. Joseph W. 
Ashby from headquarters here, while day-by-day operational control is directed 
by Italian Lt. Gen. Antonio Rossetti at Vicenza, in northern Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall planning and command comes from here in Naples under Boorda, a 
four-star admiral who is also commander of U.S. naval forces in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last 10 days, a net of NATO-U.N. cooperation has been woven in a 
Naples-Zagreb-Sarajevo triangle. Four times Boorda and aides have flown to 
Zagreb to confer with Cot and Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it comes down to if the bell rings is Rose-to-Boorda-to-the-pilots," one 
senior officer said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the pilots, the sharp end of NATO's stick, who represent another novelty 
in preparations for any assault. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Gulf, intelligence officers told attacking units what to expect. This 
time, the pilots know better than anybody at headquarters what Bosnia's like -- 
they know it like the back of their hands," said a U.S. officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last year's air embargo, NATO pilots have made more than 11,000 flights 
over Bosnia, 7,000 of them in the sort of aircraft that would attack the guns. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilots also have trained extensively with U.N. forward observers in the 
hills around Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 "By now many pilots and observers are on a first-name basis -- and they both 
know where the guns are," one officer said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the cards seem stacked, they are -- even without counting friendly 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 What NATO planners call "the warring factions" in Bosnia may scowl at one 
another through binoculars. NATO is wed to in-flight electronic wizardry. 
Thanks to it, commanders at sea and on land can see all of Bosnia in real time 
on their desktop computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the order comes to fly, we'll have done all we can to minimize the fog of 
war and the strangeness of the place," a senior American officer said.

HEALTH PLAN'S EMPLOYER-FUNDING CLAUSE DRAWS MOST FIRE; MEDICINE: CONTROVERSY 
TURNS ON CLINTON MANDATE FOR BUSINESS TO COVER 80% OF COST FOR ALL EMPLOYEES. A 
SMALL-BUSINESS OWNERS GROUP STRONGLY OBJECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Show us, Hillary Rodham Clinton likes to say. If anyone has a better idea, 
come and work with us. How would you guarantee affordable private medical 
insurance to every American? 
</P>
<P>
 What provokes these challenges from the First Lady is criticism of the 
Administration's proposal to make employers pay 80% of the cost of basic health 
insurance for all employees, with workers picking up the remainder in most 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Many features of President Clinton's health care reform plan are 
controversial. Almost every element in the proposal faces opposition from at 
least one special interest group. 
</P>
<P>
 But no provision has drawn such sustained fire from opponents as the idea of 
requiring businesses to pay the lion's share of workers' health insurance 
premiums. And on no feature of the plan does the Administration seem less 
willing to yield. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to have an employer mandate," said Ira Magaziner, a senior White 
House health care adviser. Short of a broad-based tax, he said, "we haven't 
been able to find an alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 If health coverage is to be truly universal, the Administration maintains, 
there is no politically feasible way to pay for it except employer mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 And if universal coverage is the President's line in the sand -- as he has 
repeatedly said it is -- then the decisive battle over comprehensive health 
care reform will likely be fought over the employer mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Clinton chose the mandate as the key to his plan for financing 
universal coverage in large part because it would be an extension of the status 
quo: Most Americans already get their health insurance through the workplace. 
"Our plan," the President has said, achieves its goals "by building on what 
works now." 
</P>
<P>
 If fully implemented, the mandate would cover more than 80% of the estimated 
38 million uninsured Americans who already are jobholders or dependents of 
jobholders. The remaining 7 million would receive premium subsidies from the 
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Job-based insurance is a byproduct of World War II wage and price controls 
that exempted employer-paid health insurance premiums. Companies were also 
allowed to deduct as a business expense -- as they still are -- the health 
benefits they provide to employees. Likewise, such benefits were not counted 
against individuals as taxable personal income -- and they still are not. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, offering generous medical benefits became a way to attract and 
retain good employees during a time of wage ceilings. Princeton University 
sociologist Paul Starr, who advised the Clinton White House last year, said 
employment-based insurance grew steadily until the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Partly because employment has shifted from manufacturing to services, and 
unions have declined, jobs with health benefits have been stagnant while jobs 
without benefits have grown," Starr wrote in his new book, "The Logic of Health 
Care Reform: Why and How the President's Plan Will Work." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, 138 million Americans under age 65 have employment-based coverage, or 
about five-eighths of the non-Medicare eligible population. 
</P>
<P>
 The 38 million uninsured represent 17.4% of the non-elderly population, 
including more than 20 million children. Among these are most part-time, 
minimum-wage and seasonal workers. Also, as health care prices have risen 
sharply, dependents are being dropped from coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Employment-based health coverage can impose onerous burdens on small 
businesses, whose health insurance premiums are disproportionately high because 
of an insurance industry practice known as "experience rating." That means 
rates for small groups, higher to begin with, are raised -- sometimes 
exorbitantly -- on the basis of one person's costly illness. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, small businesses pay 25% to 40% more for the same health coverage 
than larger firms, which make use of their size and bargaining power. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton plan guarantees that health premiums paid by businesses will not 
exceed 7.9% of their payroll costs; if they do, government subsidies would make 
up the difference. For the smallest firms with mostly low-wage workers, the cap 
would be just 3.5% of payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents 600,000 
small-business owners, strongly objects to the employer mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 Health premiums often represent the single largest payroll expense for a small 
business, and an employer mandate could destroy many such enterprises, said 
John Motley, the NFIB's vice president for federal government relations. He 
said 60% of the nation's employers had fewer than five employees and that 74% 
of them did not provide insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a new mandate, he said, would deter business start-ups and force many 
existing firms to raise prices, reduce wages or lay off workers. 
</P>
<P>
 But all that is already happening under the current system, Administration 
officials say. If the President's reforms are enacted, "the cost for small 
businesses will be dramatically reduced," Hillary Clinton said in a speech last 
week to the American Legion. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though many businesses, especially large firms, now spend more than 7.9% 
of payroll for health care and would seemingly benefit under the proposed 
employer mandate, few have been vocal in supporting the Clinton plan, in part 
because of their doubts about other parts of the complex agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 That reticence may have less to do with economics than an innate business 
suspicion of government, said Edward F. Howard, executive vice president of the 
Alliance for Health Reform, a nonprofit, nonpartisan educational organization 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "Businesses don't trust government. Their leaders are people who have made 
markets work, and they just don't believe government should run the health care 
system," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons have portrayed the employer mandate as an issue of fairness, 
saying that every business and individual should pay something in a system of 
universal coverage. They have noted that even the uninsured get treatment 
today, albeit often too late and in too costly a fashion -- typically a 
hospital emergency room -- with the costs shifted to those with insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts agree that to attain universal coverage, there are only two 
alternatives to an employer mandate. "The only three people who can pay for 
universal coverage are individuals, employers or the taxpayers," said Lynn 
Etheredge, a Bethesda, Md., analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.), as part of his so-called single-payer plan, is 
aiming at the taxpayers. But his broad-based tax is widely deemed politically 
unfeasible. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.), the sponsor of a competing health reform plan, 
has proposed putting the financial burden directly on individuals to pay their 
own way. But the First Lady charges that this approach would be highly 
difficult to enforce and would encourage employers to drop their current 
insurance plans for their workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus the only "sensible approach," she said, "is to build on the 
employer-employee system." 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts say they foresee possible areas of compromise on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials are hinting that businesses, especially smaller firms, 
could end up paying less than 80% of premium costs. Another variable is to 
structure a long phase-in period, perhaps tied to some economic indicator, thus 
providing time for other elements of the reform agenda to bring down costs 
first. "Those things are all negotiable," one top Administration health adviser 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But "the mandate is the key to achieving universal coverage," Hillary Clinton 
said. "Without the employer mandate, we will continue to tinker around the 
edges and not provide for universal coverage."

FATE OF BALANCED BUDGET VOTE LEFT TO 12 SENATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Both sides lack the votes they'll need to win the Senate's looming fight over 
a balanced budget constitutional amendment, leaving its fate up to 12 
fence-sitting senators, an Associated Press survey shows. 
</P>
<P>
 With supporters needing 67 votes for the two-thirds majority constitutional 
amendments require, 60 senators said they would vote "yes" or were likely to do 
so. Twenty-seven others said they opposed the proposal or probably would -- 
seven short of the 34 "no" votes foes will need to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) refused to answer the survey, which was 
conducted last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither side has enough votes as of today," chief opponent Sen. Robert C. 
Byrd (D-W. Va.) said Friday, a sentiment echoed by main sponsor, Sen. Paul 
Simon (D-Ill.). 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said Saturday that he thinks the 
margin might be even smaller than the AP found. "I would say we're two or three 
votes short," Dole, who supports the amendment, said on NBC-TV. 
</P>
<P>
 The amendment would require balanced federal budgets beginning in the year 
2001 unless three-fifths of the members of the House and Senate voted to allow 
a deficit. But it does not state how deficits will be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate's showdown debate on the measure could begin as early as Tuesday 
and could last a week or more. Its outcome is crucial because should the 
chamber vote its approval, House passage is considered likely. The amendment 
fell one vote short of passage the last time the Senate debated it in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure has been the focus of all-out lobbying on both sides. The Clinton 
Administration and labor groups unleashed studies predicting widespread havoc 
in federal programs should the amendment be enacted. Simon produced a letter of 
support from 254 economists. And Simon and Byrd paraded platoons of supportive 
witnesses at rival hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 12 senators who told the AP they remain undecided, three are 
Republicans: Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas, John C. Danforth of Missouri and 
Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico. Both sides expect Kassebaum, who has opposed 
balanced budget amendments in the past, to do so again. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine are Democrats, making them appealing targets for the White House. They 
are David Pryor of Arkansas, Sam Nunn of Georgia, Tom Harkin of Iowa, Barbara 
A. Mikulski of Maryland, Harry Reid of Nevada, Kent Conrad of North Dakota, 
John Glenn of Ohio, Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island and Jim Sasser of Tennessee.

 Top officials in former Democratic Sen. Paul E. Tsongas' 1992 presidential 
campaign knew that its fund-raiser, Paul A. Rizzo Jr., was diverting money for 
personal use, the Federal Election Commission says. The FEC, which shared its 
preliminary audit findings with the Tsongas election committee in Boston, said 
several campaign officials knew Rizzo was involved in fraudulent activities, 
according to Gary C. Crossen, the committee's attorney.Crossen is rebutting the 
FEC's findings, and said he had submitted a 150-page report to the commission. 
Rizzo, 59, pleaded guilty to siphoning off campaign funds and improperly using 
the campaign name to borrow money. He was sentenced to 52 months in prison. 
Tsongas has denied knowing about Rizzo's illegal activities. If campaign 
officials knew of Rizzo's illegal activities, the committee could face heavy 
fines.

 The General Accounting Office, in its first-ever audit of the Internal Revenue 
Service, found "fundamental deficiencies" -- including double payment for some 
services -- in IRS management of its $6.7-billion budget in 1992. According to 
the GAO, an arm of Congress, the IRS system for administering its own money was 
so bad that auditors were unable even to review 64% of the agency's 
budget.However, the audit was performed while the IRS was in the midst of 
replacing its accounting system. "In some ways this is old news," said IRS 
Chief Financial Officer Morgan Kinghorn. "We now have . . . (the new system) in 
place. It's nearly 90% complete and it will, over time, eliminate every 
problem" cited by the GAO. The IRS is the nation's largest revenue collector, 
expecting to process tax returns from 117 million Americans this year.

 A judge in Chattanooga, Tenn., who released a rape suspect last week saying he 
should get a girlfriend, reconsidered and had the man jailed.Vincent Cousin was 
ordered held pending a March 9 hearing after dozens of people called to 
complain, Judge Doug Meyer said. Cousin was arrested on a rape charge in 1989 
but was found innocent by reason of insanity. When he stopped taking medication 
and undergoing court-ordered counseling, Cousin was called dangerous by a 
mental health worker who wrote to Meyer urging that Cousin be locked up. Cousin 
was arrested Feb. 11. Prosecutors had asked Meyer to commit him to a mental 
institution, but the judge refused.

THE TIMES POLL: ROMAN CATHOLIC PRIESTS AND NUNS SPEAK OUT; VOICES AND REACTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Sometimes my church does not respect the sincerity of Catholics who disagree 
with church teachings after genuine soul-searching and prayer. Such people are 
made to feel disloyal. That is a cause of great pain in people's lives. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 42-year-old priest from the North 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There exists in the Roman Catholic Church too much pick-and-choose 
Catholicism. To be considered Catholic, one must accept all that the church 
teaches." 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 29-year-old priest from the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Our culture and our society make it very difficult for people to remain 
married today. Someone might object that the churches aren't giving them the 
support they need. Not true! Our anti-religious culture does not give them the 
support they need." 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 63-year-old priest from the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not afraid of the church's future in the United States, and the main 
reason is this: Our Catholic laity are beginning to assume the ownership of the 
church that is rightfully theirs. To be an active priest for more than four 
decades is to know the Holy Spirit operates everywhere -- even in California." 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 69-year-old priest from the North. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Our church leadership keeps secrets, fears dissent . . . . The only thing 
that prompts me to remain a priest is that the people in the pews are also fed 
up with Rome and bishops appointed by Rome. They're not children and they 
refuse to be treated as such. They give me hope." 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 48-year-old priest from the South 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I think because the number of priests has declined, many of us are becoming 
nothing but sacramental machines. I hate to see priesthood come to this. We are 
ordained to be ministers of word and sacrament, to be with the people, not just 
show up, do a sacrament for them and then leave them until next week." 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 34-year-old priest from the Midwest 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a serious shortage of priests. Maybe the solution to the problem is 
let those priests who left and married return to priestly ministry (and) allow 
married men to be ordained. . . . I feel women are going to extremes in 
agitating for ordination to the priesthood." 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 76-year-old nun from the Midwest 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "What the church and the clergy need most is not married clergy or lax moral 
codes. The church needs the affirmation of the people. Clergy need the support 
of the faithful. Society is often the cause of demoralizing the clergy." 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 58-year-old priest from the North 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "If a Divine Lord founded a church, it cannot be a democratic institution 
because you just don't get democratic with the Divinity. He did not found a 
debating society. We obey or we take the consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 74-year-old priest from the Midwest 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The big problem with the church is that it is not customer-oriented. So many 
priests, nuns and lay apostles act like postal clerks instead of car salesmen. 
. . . I do not mean we should tailor the Gospel to modern tastes, but we have 
to have a welcoming stance toward sinners, which includes everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 70-year-old priest from the South 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Priests should work 10 years, be married 10 years and study three years. We 
might know what we are talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 67-year-old priest from the North 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Regarding sin, I must say that I don't know what is a sin and what isn't a 
sin anymore. I'll just let God be the judge."

BROWN BACKS IMMIGRANT RIGHTS PRINCIPLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Treasurer Kathleen Brown generally aligned herself Saturday with 
immigration principles advocated by leading California Latino lawmakers, but 
the gubernatorial hopeful deviated on the thorny issue of the military's role 
in policing the nation's borders. 
</P>
<P>
 While opposing direct military patrols, Brown said she favors the use of 
National Guard and other troops as logistic support -- supplying 
transportation, communications and other needs -- for the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, the civilian enforcement agency. Such a move, she said, 
would free some U.S. Border Patrol agents from peripheral tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, an active participant in Sacramento's heated immigration debate, spoke 
after meeting in Los Angeles with advocates and Latino officeholders who have 
formed Proponents for Responsible Immigration Debate and Education (PRIDE), a 
coalition that seeks to counter immigrant-bashing and shape discussions of the 
topic. Afterward, Los Angeles City Councilman Mike Hernandez said Brown's 
comments prompted him to reconsider his endorsement of her for the Democratic 
gubernatorial nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of military involvement in immigration matters is extremely 
sensitive in Latino communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal law bars the military from performing civilian law enforcement tasks 
such as arresting illegal immigrants because of their residence status. But 
National Guard troops and other soldiers have been utilized increasingly in 
recent years to erect boundary fences, improve border-area roads and assist 
with surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping immigration enforcement in civilian hands is one of the coalition's 
four base-line principles. Other tenets support the right of immigrants to 
medical care and education, while upholding citizenship guarantees for everyone 
born in the United States -- including the children of illegal immigrants. The 
coalition also encourages immigrants to sign up for U.S. citizenship and 
stresses the need to provide economic aid and abet democracy in immigrant 
homelands. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown enthusiastically backed three of the coalition's four precepts, while 
departing on the question of military border backup. Her Democratic 
gubernatorial opponent, Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, has endorsed the 
four principles.

STUDENT'S SLAYING RECALLS UNSOLVED CASES; MURDERS: LIKE CATHY TORREZ, WENDY 
OSBORN AND DENISE HUBER VANISHED AND WERE NEVER SEEN ALIVE AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The details are painfully familiar: The life of a sweet-natured young woman 
with a vibrant smile and seemingly limitless future is cut short violently, 
mysteriously. 
</P>
<P>
 The grisly discovery of Cathy Torrez's body in the trunk of her car early 
Saturday has left her friends and family devastated, wondering how it happened 
and why. The tragedy also revives memories of the still-unsolved cases of two 
missing Orange County girls and a young woman. 
</P>
<P>
 When Placentia Mayor Norman Z. Eckenrode learned about 20-year-old Torrez on 
Saturday, he was shocked. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is devastating to everyone. I can't believe this happened in our little 
Placentia," he said, adding that the last similar killing took place in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Osborn, the 14-year-old daughter of Jack and Carol Osborn of Placentia, 
was last seen alive Jan. 20, 1987, toting a pink book bag and red purse as she 
walked to Tuffree Junior High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy was a bright, loving girl who earned A's and Bs in school, wore glasses 
and braces and had a talent for writing. Her hobbies were reading and sewing. 
</P>
<P>
 Her purse was found in an Anaheim dumpster shortly after she vanished. Two 
weeks later, horseback riders found Wendy's clothed, partially decomposed body 
in the Chino Hills of San Bernardino County. She had been dead just two days -- 
raising the possibility she had been held captive -- and had been strangled and 
sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has been charged in the slaying, although authorities at one point 
believed they had a key suspect, but insufficient evidence to prove their case. 
</P>
<P>
 After a funeral attended by about 500 people, Wendy was buried in a small 
white coffin covered with carnations and rosebuds. 
</P>
<P>
 The case remains open. The city's $10,000 reward for information leading to 
the capture of Wendy's killer stands unclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities also are no closer to solving the disappearance of Denise A. Huber 
than when the 23-year-old Newport Beach woman was reported missing June 3, 
1991, while driving home from a rock concert in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Her car was found on the Corona del Mar Freeway -- just 2 1/2 miles from home 
-- with a flat tire. Police dogs that searched the area followed her scent but 
it abruptly ended, indicating she may have entered another car. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1990 UC Irvine graduate in social sciences, Huber was working two jobs as a 
waitress and department store clerk while trying to decide on a career. 
</P>
<P>
 An extensive police investigation has failed to turn up any clues, but the 
Huber family did not stop there. They called on the services of a private 
detective, psychics and an extensive ground search by friends and relatives 
armed with flyers and bumper stickers. They put up billboards and banners 
asking for help. Friends and relatives raised a $10,000 reward. The case was 
publicized nationwide on television shows "Inside Edition" and "America's Most 
Wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis and Ione Huber appealed to the conscience of anyone who might have the 
least bit of information. 
</P>
<P>
 But the anniversaries of Huber's disappearance -- as well as the holidays and 
her birthdays -- have come and gone and approach again without any sign of the 
missing woman. In interviews, the Hubers said they were tormented by not 
knowing what happened and feared the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 When 12-year-old Polly Klaas was abducted in October from her Petaluma home, 
her parents, friends and even concerned strangers unleashed a nationwide 
campaign to help find the little girl. Her body was later found off a busy 
highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say such well-orchestrated efforts to get the word out about a missing 
person is part of the legacy that 3-year-old Laura Bradbury of Huntington Beach 
left when she vanished from Joshua Tree National Monument near a family 
campsite on Oct. 18, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Her disappearance is credited as a catalyst for a national movement to 
organize agencies, resources and laws to help find missing children. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bradbury family set up a nonprofit organization that distributed millions 
of flyers and T-shirts with the picture of the little girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents appeared on radio and television talk shows seeking information, 
and Laura became one of the first missing children whose photographs appeared 
on milk cartons. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their efforts, the Laura Bradbury case came to a tragic close. Two 
years after she was reported missing, hikers found bone fragments near the 
campsite where she disappeared. They were positively linked to the girl.

LOS ANGELES; RUNNER HOLDS OLYMPIC MOMENT HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL CHASTANG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Across-country star at Hamilton High School, Genevieve DeBose has had plenty 
of experience competing before a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 But if she felt nervous in her last run, she can be forgiven. Her audience, 
after all, was the world. 
</P>
<P>
 DeBose, 16, helped carry the Olympic flame on its 5,000-mile path to 
Lillehammer, Norway. She ran a 500-meter leg Feb. 5 in Morgedal, a town 
southwest of Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started thinking, 'What if I slip on the ice, what if I drop the torch?" 
she said. Los Angeles Unified School District athletic officials picked DeBose 
to take part in the torch relay after she won the girls' City Section 
cross-country finals in November -- the first Hamilton High runner ever to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
 She was one of two Los Angeles students to run in the relay, both sponsored by 
Coca-Cola. The other was Humberto Sanchez of South Gate High. 
</P>
<P>
 DeBose, a senior at Hamilton, said that when she arrived in Norway, the 
subfreezing weather overwhelmed her. "My parents and I toured Oslo the first 
day, but we only stayed outside one hour. We were really cold," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of the event, DeBose, Sanchez and three other Americans picked 
for the relay ran five miles in the snow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had on sweats and long johns, and usually when you run you get warmed up, 
and you have to take off your sweat shirt," she said. "But not in Oslo." 
</P>
<P>
 During the relay, DeBose said, she didn't drop the torch because "I was too 
excited." 
</P>
<P>
 But the run was difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "The torch was nearly four feet high, and I'm 5-foot-3. I carried the torch in 
my right hand, but it weighed two pounds. After a while, it felt like my arm 
was going to fall off." 
</P>
<P>
 Making friends from other countries, said DeBose, was one of the best parts of 
the trip. While speaking Spanish to a parent of one of the other relay runners, 
DeBose met a Norwegian girl who had grown up in Colombia. The pair became pen 
pals.  
</P>
<P>
 And while playing a piano in a hotel lounge, she befriended some of the 
Japanese torch runners. 
</P>
<P>
 "(They) came around and one of them said, 'Beauty and the Beast?,' " DeBose 
said. "I said, 'No, Aladdin.' Then they asked if I would take a picture with 
them." CAROL CHASTANG

EXHIBIT: SHOWING HISTORY OF BLACKS IN MORMON CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As an active Mormon and former missionary, I was pleased to hear about the 
exhibit of African American heirlooms at the Los Angeles Temple Visitors 
Center. ("History of Black Mormonism,") We have come a long way in a relatively 
short time. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't that long ago that our prophets taught as Scripture that African 
Americans would never hold the Mormon priesthood in this life, and that God's 
penalty for interracial marriage with African Americans will always be "death 
on the spot." 
</P>
<P>
 It took courage for our leaders to overturn these doctrines in 1978, 
especially when the reversal implicitly labeled three of our prophets -- 
Brigham Young, David O. McKay and George A. Smith -- as purveyors of false 
doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit doesn't mention this aspect of the courage and inspiration that 
went into that 1978 decision, but our leaders can be proud of themselves. We 
are certainly proud of them.

RENTERS: DEPLORING NAME-CALLING TACTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The use of terms like "Draconian," "Anti-Intellectual Elites," "Fascists," 
"Leftists," and other offensive terms by Kip Dellinger (Letters, Feb. 13) to 
describe tenants of Santa Monica and supporters of rent control, demands an 
answer if not an apology. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Dellinger is an obvious expert in the art of name calling.But he doesn't 
even know me, and I do not fit one of his above descriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither do my neighbors. Neither do members of Santa Monicans For Renters 
Rights (SMRR). Neither do members of the Rent Control Board or of the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 We resent and deplore such McCarthy tactics as these which find a place in a 
newspaper which wins awards for excellence in journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 We demand an end to such intolerance, bordering on racism, which tries 
desperately to take advantage of the misery to human beings caused by the 
earthquake.
